On May 14, 2015, three members of the Savopoulos family—Savvas, Amy, and their son Philip—as well as their housekeeper, Veralicia Figueroa, were killed at the Savopoulos home in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=murder/&gt;&lt;ref name=murderer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jouvenal|first1=Justin|last2=Zapotosky|first2=Matt|last3=Morse|first3=Dan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/probe-continues-into-mysterious-deaths-of-four-in-burning-dc-home/2015/05/15/8936d0aa-fb24-11e4-9ef4-1bb7ce3b3fb7_story.html|title=Four found in D.C. fire were slain, police say|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 15, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims were held hostage for 19 hours, starting on May 13.

The perpetrator(s) restrained them with [[duct tape]] before killing them, then set the house on fire.&lt;ref name=murderer/&gt; They all sustained [[blunt force trauma]], and Philip was also stabbed. On October 25, 2018 the defendant Daron Wint, a welder fired from a company owned by Savvas Savopoulos was found guilty of 20 counts of kidnapping, extortion and murder. &lt;ref name="foundguilty"&gt;{{cite news|title=DC Mansion Murders defendant found guilty on all counts|url=https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc-mansion-murders-defendant-found-guilty-on-all-counts/65-608074660?ref=exit-recirc|accessdate=October 25, 2018|work=[[WUSA (TV)]]|date=October 25, 2018 |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robbery and murder==
The perpetrators stole $40,000 in cash from the family after an assistant, Jordan Wallace, delivered it to the house.&lt;ref name=cash/&gt; They also stole the family's blue [[Porsche 911|Porsche]],&lt;ref name=cash/&gt; which was later found burned in a church parking lot in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wtop.com/dc/2015/05/report-d-c-family-held-killed-house-torched/|title=Report: D.C. family was held before being killed, house torched|work=[[WTOP-FM]]|date=May 19, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2015, the Savopoulos house in [[Northwest Washington, D.C.|Northwest Washington]] was spotted ablaze and firefighters were called. They discovered the three bodies of the Savopoulos family and their housekeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marraco|first1=Marina|last2=Limon|first2=Alexandra|url=http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/29066982/four-dead-fire|title=3 adults, 1 child found dead at suspicious NW DC house fire|work=[[WTTG]]|date=May 14, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police determined the fire was intentionally set, and the victims had blunt-force and stab wounds, leading them to label the deaths homicides.&lt;ref name=murderer/&gt;

==Victims==
The Savopouloses were a prominent, upper-class family in the [[Woodley Park]] neighborhood of Northwest Washington. Savvas Savopoulos was the CEO and president of American Iron Works, a construction company that played a role in building the [[Verizon Center]].&lt;ref name=murderer/&gt;

The slain victims are:

* Savvas Phillip Savopoulos, age 46, a prominent area businessman
* Amy Clare Savopoulos (''née'' Martin), age 47, Savvas's wife
* Philip Savvas Savopoulos, age 10, their son
* Veralicia Figueroa, age 57, their housekeeper

Two teenage daughters, Abigail and Katerina Savopoulos, were not present at the scene when the four were killed.&lt;ref name="Daughters"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Wills|title=Surviving daughter of DC mansion murder posts moving photos in tribute to her slain parents and brother as the trial is delayed|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3250990/Surviving-daughter-DC-mansion-murders-posts-tributes-parents-brother-trial-delayed-December.html|work=[[The Daily Mail]]|date=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suspect ==
'''Daron Dylon Wint''' (born November 27, 1980) was identified by police as the prime suspect in the case. He was found by matching his DNA to that found on the crust of a [[Domino's Pizza|Domino's]] pizza delivered to the house on May 13, while the family was apparently captive.&lt;ref name=pizza&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillip|first1=Abby|last2=Alexander|first2=Keith L.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/05/21/how-a-dominos-pizza-crust-led-police-to-a-suspect-in-the-d-c-mansion-murders/|title=How a Domino's pizza crust led police to a suspect in mysterious D.C. slayings|work=The Washington Post|date=May 21, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a certified welder who formerly worked at American Iron Works, leading police to believe the murders weren't random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hermann|first1=Peter|last2=Bui|first2=Lynh|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/police-search-for-suspect-in-savopoulos-slayings/2015/05/21/3d707c0c-ffa7-11e4-833c-a2de05b6b2a4_story.html|title=Suspect in quadruple killings worked for victims’ family business, police say|work=The Washington Post|date=May 21, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wint is originally from [[Guyana]] and immigrated to the U.S. in 2000. He was a [[United States Marine Corps]] recruit but was discharged before his training was complete for medical reasons. He had a long [[rap sheet]] of criminal charges; he was convicted in 2009 of second-degree assault in Maryland and sentenced to 30 days in jail, and also pleaded guilty to the crime of malicious destruction of property in 2010 as part of a plea deal, in which a second charge, burglary, was dropped.&lt;ref name=arrest&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nuckols|first1=Ben|title=Suspect in killings of wealthy DC family arrested|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4c2cb1e7a0e14dbbad799c78e9b43957/suspect-killings-wealthy-dc-family-arrested|accessdate=May 22, 2015|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been charged in the past with theft, assault, a sexual offense,&lt;ref name=murder /&gt; and weapons possession.&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt;

After Wint's DNA was matched, a warrant was issued for his arrest on a charge of [[first-degree murder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2015/05/arrest-warrant-issued-for-suspect-in-quadruple-murder-on-may-14-in-northwest-d-c--114123.html|title=Suspect ID'd in quadruple murder in Northwest D.C.|work=WJLA-TV|date=May 20, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wint was found and arrested on May 21, 2015, in northeast Washington, a week after the murders,&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt; and was subsequently charged with first-degree murder.&lt;ref name=prosecution&gt;{{cite news|last1=Botelho|first1=Greg|last2=Mallonee|first2=Mary Kay|last3=Payne|first3=Ed|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/22/us/washington-mansion-fire-slayings/index.html|title=Prosecutors: Suspect in Washington family's killings did not act alone|work=CNN|date=May 22, 2015|accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors believe Wint had help killing the victims and did not act alone.&lt;ref name=prosecution/&gt; Wint is the only person charged in the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/savopoulos-family-thanks-law-enforcement-after-arrest-in-slayings/2015/05/22/4b5b488a-0077-11e5-8b6c-0dcce21e223d_story.html|title=Suspect in 4 gruesome D.C. killings might not have acted alone, police say|first=Peter|last=Hermann|date=May 22, 2015|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
Attorney [[Robin Ficker]] said that Wint did not seem violent when he defended him in earlier cases. "My impression of him — I remember him rather well — is that he wouldn't hurt a fly. He's a very nice person," Ficker said.&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt; He then characterized Wint as "kind and gentle" and added that authorities have arrested "the wrong guy" in the Savopoulos case, claiming, "They've made a big mistake here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Botelho|first1=Greg|title=Who is DC murder suspect Darron Dellon Dennis Wint ?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/22/us/washington-murder-suspect-wint/|accessdate=May 23, 2015|work=CNN|date=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ficker also said that Wint's family had told him "that he doesn't like pizza and never eats pizza", referring to the matching of Wint's DNA to that found on a pizza crust at the crime scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Iannelli|first1=Nick|title=Daron Wint's family doesn't believe he is guilty of D.C. murder, arson|url=http://wtop.com/dc/2015/05/daron-wints-family-doesnt-believe-he-is-guilty-of-d-c-murder-arson/|accessdate=June 2, 2015|work=WTOP-FM|date=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The father of Wint says his son should "suffer the consequences" if found guilty.&lt;ref name="FatherSuspect"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thornhill|first1=Ted|last2=Robinson|first2=Wills|title=Father of DC mansion quadruple murder suspect says his son should 'suffer the consequences' for 'heartless' crime if found guilty|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3100479/Father-quadruple-murder-suspect-DC-mansion-fire-says-son-Daron-Wint-suffer-consequences-heartless-crime-guilty.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=The Daily Mail|date=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After almost two years, the five-bedroom, six-bathroom house was demolished. Located in the tony neighborhood near the National Cathedral, the property was once valued at $4.5 million but sold months after the killings for just $3 million.&lt;ref name="Demolition"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Iacone|first1=Amanda|last2=Cloherty|first2=Megan|title=Demolition begins at posh DC home where 4 were killed|url=https://wtop.com/dc/2017/04/13547941/slide/1/|work=WTOP-FM|date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other housekeeper, Nelly Gutierrez, who worked for the Savopoulos family for nearly two decades and was working elsewhere on the day of the murders, spoke out two years afterwards.&lt;ref name="OtherHousekeeper"&gt;{{cite news|title=Housekeeper, who narrowly escaped with her life, speaks out on second anniversary of DC mansion murders and reveals wife of wealthy CEO was 'distracted' in the weeks before she was killed|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5050655/Housekeeper-says-victim-DC-mansion-murders-stressed.html|work=The Daily Mail|date=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3213">'''Abu Hafsa Yazid''' ({{lang-ar|ابو حفصة يزيد |translit=Abū Ḥafṣah Yazīd}}) was a [[mawla]], or servant, of the Umayyad Caliph [[Marwan I|Marwan ibn al-Hakkam]] (''r''. 684–685).&lt;ref name=Khallikan&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eeE80B81GfgC&amp;pg=PA343 |title=Ibn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary |volume=3 |author=Ibn Khallikan |publisher=Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland |year=1868 |pages=343–347 |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yazid's full name is not known; ''Abu Hafsa'' means "father of Hafsa" (see [[Arabic name]]).

Marwan freed Yazid and assigned him posts including taxation in [[Medina]]. He married the daughter of the [[amir]] of [[al-Yamama]], and among their descendants were several prominent [[poet]]s of the early Islamic period, including [[Marwan ibn Abi Hafsa]] and [[Marwan ibn Abi al-Janub]].&lt;ref name=Bosworth&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tPsUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA625 |title=The Encyclopedia of Islam |volume=6 |series=Fascicules 107-108 |first=Clifford Edmund |last=Bosworth |publisher=Brill Archive |year=1989 |isbn=90-04-09082-7 |page=625 |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meisami&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DbCFBX6b3eEC&amp;pg=PA511 |title=Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature |volume=2 |first1=Julie Scott |last1=Meisami |first2=Paul |last2=Starkey |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1998 |isbn=0-415-18572-6 |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Hafsa Yazid's origins are unclear; he may have been either [[Persian people|Persian]] or [[Jews|Jewish]].&lt;ref name=Bosworth/&gt; He may have been taken prisoner as a youth in the capture of [[Istakhr]] in ca 650 CE, and later sold to the [[Caliph]]. He was freed on the day of the assassination of [[Uthman ibn Affan]]. Sources vary as to whether Abu Hafsa Yazid converted to [[Islam]] or retained his [[Judaism|Jewish faith]].&lt;ref name=Khallikan/&gt;

Abu Hafsa Yazid is sometimes described as court [[physician]] to the [[Caliph]] [[Umar I]] around the year 643 CE,&lt;ref name=Jewish&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DL5tAAAAMAAJ |title=The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia |volume=8 |first=Isaac |last=Landman |editor=Simon Cohen |publisher=The Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, Inc |year=1942 |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this may be an error based on writings by later [[Arabian history|Arab historians]], as he is not called a physician in the earliest texts.&lt;ref name=Siddiqi&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7C9rAAAAMAAJ |title=Studies in Arabic and Persian Medical Literature |first=Muḥammad Zubair |last=Siddiqi |publisher=Calcutta University |year=1959 |pages=6, 8 |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert George Haynesworth III''' (born June 17, 1981) is a former [[American football]] [[defensive tackle]] who played in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for ten seasons. He played [[college football]] at the [[University of Tennessee]]. Drafted by the [[Tennessee Titans]] in the first round (15th overall) of the [[2002 NFL Draft]], he spent his first seven NFL seasons with the Titans. An All-Pro selection in 2007 and 2008, and considered "the most dominant defensive tackle in the league" at that time,&lt;ref name="TSNranking"&gt;{{cite news|title=Defensive tackle rankings: Nobody dominates like Haynesworth |url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2009-05-21/defensive-tackle-rankings-nobody-dominates-haynesworth |work=[[The Sporting News]] |date=May 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d0eQRjI?url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2009-05-21/defensive-tackle-rankings-nobody-dominates-haynesworth |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haynesworth was a highly coveted [[free agent]] following the [[2008 NFL season|2008 season]].  He signed a seven-year, $100 million contract with the [[Washington Redskins]] in February 2009,&lt;ref name="BattistaNYT"&gt;{{cite news |first=Judy |last=Battista |title=Paying Top Dollar, the Redskins Sign Haynesworth |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9A00E0DE1E3AF93BA15751C0A96F9C8B63.html\ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726104119/https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9A00E0DE1E3AF93BA15751C0A96F9C8B63.html|archive-date=July 26, 2018 |work=New York Times |dead-url=yes |date=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but played less than two full seasons with Washington. The Redskins' acquisition of Haynesworth has since been widely derided as the worst free agent signing in NFL history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81fe031a/article/easy-to-come-up-with-worst-freeagency-move-of-last-decade |title=Easy to come up with worst free-agency move of last decade |newspaper=NFL.com |date=May 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--worst-free-agent-signings-since--93--redskins--redskins-dominate-list-140917033.html |title=Worst free-agent signings since '93: Redskins, Raiders dominate list |newspaper=Yahoo!

==High school career==
Haynesworth was born in [[Hartsville, South Carolina]].  He attended [[Hartsville High School]], and participated in [[high school football|football]], [[Track and field|track]], and [[shot put]].&lt;ref name="HS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/colosseum/midfield/4656/99vols.html.tmp |title=The Vol Signing Class of 1999 |publisher=Jumpmaster's Vols Page |accessdate=August 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60cjoz0xi?url=http://www.oocities.org/colosseum/midfield/4656/99vols.html.tmp |archivedate=August 1, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing under head coach Lewis Lineberger, Haynesworth accounted for 150 tackles, 56 tackles for loss, six sacks, and six fumble recoveries as a junior; he followed that by tallying 110 tackles, 51 quarterback pressures, and six sacks as a senior in 1998.&lt;ref name="HS" /&gt;

Following his senior season, Haynesworth was named a SuperPrep and Rivalnet All-American, and was also rated the fourth-best defensive lineman and the 14th-ranked overall player in the nation according to ESPN's Top 100, while National Recruiting Advisor rated him as the best defensive tackle in the country.&lt;ref name="HS" /&gt; He was a member of the [[Tennessee Volunteers football|University of Tennessee Volunteers]]' 1999 recruiting class.

==College career==
As a student-athlete at the [[University of Tennessee]], Haynesworth was a three-year letterman for the [[Tennessee Volunteers football]] team under head coach [[Phillip Fulmer]].  He lined up at the right defensive tackle position next to [[John Henderson (defensive tackle)|John Henderson]]. He compiled 66 tackles, five sacks, 31 quarterback pressures, 20 tackles for a loss, and nine pass deflections during his collegiate career. He earned ''[[Sporting News]]'' Freshman All-American honors in 1999 and was named Second Team All-Southeastern Conference after his junior season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Vols Named to Associated Press All-SEC Teams|url=http://www.utsports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/120401aab.html|publisher=Tennessee Athletics|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

===2002 NFL Draft===
Considered "potentially a brutal run-stopper" by ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Freeman |first=Mike |date=March 31, 2002 |title=Panthers Could Ignore Talented Passers and Select Peppers Instead |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/31/sports/pro-football-inside-nfl-panthers-could-ignore-talented-passers-select-peppers.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haynesworth was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the first round with the 15th overall pick in the [[2002 NFL Draft]]. He was the fourth defensive tackle selected from a draft class considered to be loaded with talented defensive linemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bell |first=Jarrett |date=April 18, 2002 |title=Big, agile defensive tackles at a premium for draft |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/2002draft/2002-04-16-cover.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d0xTbar?url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/2002draft/2002-04-16-cover.htm |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Tennessee's Pro Day in 2002, when he was 20 years old, Haynesworth measured at 6-feet-6 and 317 pounds, ran a 4.82 40-yard dash, and had a 39-inch vertical jump and a 9-foot, 7-inch broad jump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?document_id=0F2D74DE9A94FDF7 |title=Talent pool looks deep |first=Todd |last=Rosiak |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date=April 11, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not work out at the 2002 [[NFL Combine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2002/03/02/combine_saturday/ |title=No startling revelations in Combine's first two days |date=March 2, 2002 |last=Pauline |first=Tony |work=Sports Illustrated |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d15CRt2?url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2002/03/02/combine_saturday/ |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tennessee Titans===
An incident foreshadowing future incidents with Haynesworth occurred at a Titans training camp in 2003, where Haynesworth kicked his former teammate, [[center (football)|center]] [[Justin Hartwig]], in the chest, then had to be restrained by other teammates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike |last=Cranston |title=Panthers' Hartwig fired up to face former team, Haynesworth |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-11-03-2157944303_x.htm |work=USA Today |date=November 3, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d1HEXDV?url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-11-03-2157944303_x.htm |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stomping incident====
On October 1, 2006, in the third quarter of a game against the [[2006 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]], [[running back]] [[Julius Jones (American football player)|Julius Jones]] scored on a rushing play. Center [[Andre Gurode]] fell to the ground, and his helmet was removed by Haynesworth. Haynesworth tried to stomp on Gurode's head, but missed. A second stomp opened a severe wound on Gurode's forehead, narrowly missing his right eye. Referee [[Jerome Boger]] assessed Haynesworth a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, to which Haynesworth protested by taking off his helmet and throwing it into the turf; Haynesworth was then assessed an additional 15-yard penalty and ejected from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3490689 |agency=Associated Press |title=Titans, Haynesworth fail to beat franchise deadline |date=July 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d1MpV9l?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3490689 |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurode later received 30 stitches just above and below his right eye. After the game, Titans head coach [[Jeff Fisher]] apologized on behalf of the Titans organization to Cowboys coach [[Bill Parcells]]. After the game, Haynesworth apologized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Haynesworth suspended for unprecedented five games |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2610577 |work=[[ESPN]] |date=October 3, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d1fapY4?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2610577 |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; saying "What I did out there was disgusting. It doesn't matter what the league does to me. The way I feel right now, you just can't describe it."  Gurode later said that he would not seek criminal charges against Haynesworth.  He continued to experience headaches and blurred vision as of October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gurode accepts Haynesworth's apology |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2615573 |work=ESPN |date=October 6, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60cykfH0m?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2615573 |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video evidence of the play shows Haynesworth bend down towards Gurode prior to his helmet being off and prior to the stomps. Because the view is partially blocked by other players it is unclear whether Haynesworth manually removes the helmet. Therefore, most media outlets reported simply that Gurode's helmet was off. However, hometown columnist Mickey Spagnola&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallascowboys.com/news.cfm?editorialAuthor=1&amp;id=0B7E6E03-CB7A-F0CF-054748FE721F0419 DallasCowboys.com – News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201180429/http://www.dallascowboys.com/news.cfm?editorialAuthor=1&amp;id=0B7E6E03-CB7A-F0CF-054748FE721F0419 |date=2006-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of DallasCowboys.com argued that Haynesworth pulled off Gurode's helmet.

On October 2, 2006, Haynesworth was suspended for five games without pay by the NFL. The suspension was only the second multi-game suspension in NFL history for an on-the-field incident, more than twice as long as the previous longest suspension, given in [[1986 NFL season|1986]] by then-commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] to [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]] nose tackle [[Charles Martin (American football)|Charles Martin]].&lt;ref name="BattistaNYT2006"&gt;{{cite news|first=Judy |last=Battista |title=Titan Player Suspended 5 Games for Kicks to Head |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/sports/football/03titans.html |work=New York Times |date=October 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 18, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60cyqGNGP?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/sports/football/03titans.html |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on his 2006 base salary of $646,251, Haynesworth forfeited more than $190,000.&lt;ref name="BattistaNYT2006" /&gt;  NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]], who had been on the job a month, stated that there was "absolutely no place in the game, or anywhere else" for Haynesworth's behavior.  However, [[ESPN]]{{'}}s [[Mark Schlereth]], a 12-year NFL veteran, felt that Haynesworth should have been suspended for the rest of the season.  ESPN analyst [[Merril Hoge]] harshly criticized the officials for not ejecting Haynesworth immediately after the stomp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Merril |last=Hoge |title=Punishment for Haynesworth not severe enough |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2610631 |work=ESPN |date=October 2, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d1tN9QL?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2610631 |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haynesworth's suspension is the longest for an in-game incident in modern NFL history.

The [[NFL Players Association]] initially planned to appeal the suspension, calling it too severe. However, Haynesworth said on October 3 that he would not appeal, after personally apologizing to Gurode in the same day. In a press conference on October 5, Haynesworth apologized to all who watched the game and said he had entered counseling to control his emotions. He also said that he would work with children in the Nashville area.

Fisher told Parcells after the game that the Titans would punish Haynesworth themselves if they felt the NFL's punishment was not harsh enough. On the same day as Haynesworth's press conference, Fisher told a national radio show that the Cowboys game may have been Haynesworth's last as a Titan.  The team had the option of either deactivating him for the final seven games of the season or releasing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Titans want Haynesworth to return bonus money |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D2615539 |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312258260FTDLGQFGNI?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D2615539 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 |work=ESPN |date=October 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Had the Titans released him, they had enough room under the salary cap to absorb the $5.5 million they would owe him for 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Haynesworth may face more punishment from Titans |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D2614453 |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312258363IQGXZMUAGB?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D2614453 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 |work=ESPN |date=October 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haynesworth was eligible to return on November 19 for the Titans' game against the [[2006 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]].  Even then, there was no guarantee that he would play. Haynesworth's agent, Chad Speck, told several media outlets that Haynesworth fully expected to return to practice on November 13, and he did indeed report that day. He played against the Eagles on November 19, and recorded one tackle.

====2007 season====
On September 9, 2007, in the season opener against the [[2007 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]], Haynesworth was called for unnecessary roughness when he slammed running back [[Maurice Jones-Drew]] to the ground after a tackle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Titans' Haynesworth fined $5,000 for hard tackle |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-09-14-691404661_x.htm |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312258486FUNIYSZIIQ?url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-09-14-691404661_x.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 | work=USA Today | date=September 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was fined $5,000 by the NFL for this incident.  Afterwards, when asked if he would be gentler during play, he commented, "I'm not going to be any gentler or whatever. Maybe I'll just help them up."

Haynesworth was elected to the [[Pro Bowl]] for the [[2008 Pro Bowl|first time]] for the [[2007 NFL season]]. During this season following the stomping incident, he ranked second on the team with six sacks in his 11 games played up to the selection, led or tied for the team-high in total tackles three times that season, and led or tied the team-high in quarterback pressures five times. At the point where the Pro Bowl selection was made, the [[2007 Tennessee Titans season|Titans]] had an 8-3 record in games in which Haynesworth started and were 0–3 in games in which he did not play.

Haynesworth said of his Pro Bowl selection, "It’s an awesome feeling. It’s kind of a load off my back because I didn’t want last year’s suspension to define my career. It was a difficult time in my life, but I was determined to keep working hard to get to this point and earn the respect of my teammates, coaches and fans." Haynesworth failed to sign with Tennessee due to the deadline of signing a franchise tagged player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Teresa M. |last=Walker |title=No deal between Titans, All Pro DT Haynesworth |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2008-07-15-3338044218_x.htm |work=USA Today |date=July 15, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d1Cdb1x?url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2008-07-15-3338044218_x.htm |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington Redskins===
An [[unrestricted free agent]] in the 2009 off-season, Haynesworth signed a seven-year, $100 million contract with the [[Washington Redskins]] on the first day of free agency, February 27, 2009.&lt;ref name="ClaytonESPN"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Clayton |title=Albert Haynesworth, Washington Redskins agree on seven-year deal |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D3939011 |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312258562XCYKSEXXGS?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D3939011 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 |work=ESPN |date=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite being offered more money&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2009/06/25/haynesworth-i-could-have-made-more-money-in-tampa-bay/|title=Haynesworth: I Could Have Made More Money In Tampa Bay|date=2009-06-25|work=ProFootballTalk|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. The deal was expected to pay Haynesworth $32 million in the first 13 months,&lt;ref name="BattistaNYT" /&gt; included $41 million guaranteed, and could have reached $115 million if all incentives were met.&lt;ref name="ClaytonESPN" /&gt; Tennessee’s final offer to Haynesworth reportedly amounted to a four-year package worth $34 million total, with about $20 million in guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Terry |last=McCormick |title=How hard did the Titans work to re-sign Haynesworth? |url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/commentary-how-hard-did-titans-work-re-sign-haynesworth |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312258584LBEIQKXQKE?url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/commentary-how-hard-did-titans-work-re-sign-haynesworth |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 |work=Nashville City Paper |date=April 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haynesworth reported on [[SIRIUS]] Blitz that the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] offered him a $120 million deal that could potentially increase by 20%. He says that he took a discount to play with the Redskins because of their large fan base and media outlet, something that he also did not have in Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2009/06/25/haynesworth-discusses-free-agency-details-vince-young/ |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312258771ZVOXPKSPUM?url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2009/06/25/haynesworth-discusses-free-agency-details-vince-young/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 |title=FreezePage |publisher=FreezePage |accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2009, the Titans asked the NFL to consider [[Tampering (Sports)|tampering]] charges against the Redskins, claiming that the Redskins contacted Haynesworth before the [[free agent|free agency]] period began on February 27.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freezepage.com/1312259074YXNDVKQNGD?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D4035877 Titans Ask NFL to Probe Signing] ESPN, April 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of his time with the Redskins, Haynesworth presented problems for the coaching staff.  He refused to participate in off-season workouts, and arrived at camp in poor physical condition, unable to pass a basic fitness test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/redskinsinsider/albert-haynesworth/albert-haynesworth-fails-to-co.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Albert Haynesworth fails to complete second part of conditioning test |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d58BBSA?url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/redskinsinsider/albert-haynesworth/albert-haynesworth-fails-to-co.html |archivedate=2011-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also made it clear that he did not like to play [[nose tackle]] in the team's 3–4 defensive scheme, having played in a 4–3 scheme in Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp10/news/story?id=5429787 |title=Albert Haynesworth starts, but unable to finish, conditioning test |work=ESPN |date=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a 45–12 loss to the [[New York Giants]] on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' in [[2009 NFL season|2009]], Haynesworth questioned the scheme of defensive coordinator [[Greg Blache]], and stated that he could not "survive another season in this system if it stays the way it is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/25/AR2009122501780.html |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312259245UWHIMSQEEV?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/25/AR2009122501780.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 |title=Haynesworth sounds off on Blache, defense after being sent home |newspaper=Washington Post |first=Jason |last=Reid |first2=Dan |last2=Steinberg |lastauthoramp=yes |date=December 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2010, it was announced that Haynesworth would spend the rest of the season on the restricted list. There had been conflicts throughout the 2010 preseason with Haynesworth and the coaching staff. After a dispute over his absence at a practice in which Haynesworth claimed to be ill, the team suspended him for "conduct detrimental to the club". Head coach [[Mike Shanahan]] said the suspension followed a refusal by Haynesworth to cooperate in a variety of ways and not only because of the practice absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/12/07/sportsline/main7126500.shtml |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312259291ZTMEDIDAZS?url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/12/07/sportsline/main7126500.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 |title=Redskins suspend Haynesworth 4 games without pay |date=December 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010 season, Haynesworth had a career-low 13 tackles and just 2.5 sacks in eight games, leading the [[NFL Network]] to name the signing of Haynesworth as the "worst free-agency move of last decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81fe031a/article/easy-to-come-up-with-worst-freeagency-move-of-last-decade|title=Easy to come up with worst free-agency move of last decade|work=NFL.com|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other NFL writers have gone further, calling Haynesworth the worst free agent bust in NFL history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/fanfuel/2012/03/28/nfl_free_agent_busts/ |title=Fan Fuel: Top 10 NFL free agent busts |work=SportsNet |date=March 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1073638-50-biggest-free-agent-signing-busts-in-nfl-history/page/52|title=NFL|author=Dan Van Wie|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haynesworth created some controversy in March 2015 when he likened [[Ndamukong Suh]]'s six-year, $114 million contract to his previous contract with the Redskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Albert Haynesworth offers advice to Ndamukong Suh|url = http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000476581/article/albert-haynesworth-offers-advice-to-ndamukong-suh|website = NFL.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New England Patriots===
Haynesworth was traded to the [[New England Patriots]] on July 28, 2011, for a fifth-round draft pick in the [[2013 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farrar|first=Doug|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/Patriots-trade-for-Haynesworth-Redskins-left-to?urn%3Dnfl-wp4049|archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312259398PQGTSWAQVR?url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/Patriots-trade-for-Haynesworth-Redskins-left-to?urn%3Dnfl-wp4049|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 2, 2011|title=Patriots trade for Haynesworth; Redskins left to sell cut-rate jerseys|work=Shutdown Corner: A Yahoo!

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Two days after being released by the Patriots, Haynesworth was claimed off waivers by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. On February 15, 2012, he was released by the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TBBuccaneers/statuses/169837201511825408|title=Twitter|work=twitter.com|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
Arrest warrants were issued against Haynesworth in two [[Tennessee]] counties in May 2006 stemming from a traffic incident on [[Interstate 40]]. Both sets of charges were dropped in June 2006. The judge in the [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] case tossed the charges on the grounds that the alleged offense happened out of their jurisdiction. In [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], the district attorney dismissed the charges. In March 2009, Haynesworth was indicted on two [[misdemeanor]] traffic charges stemming from a December 2008 car accident in Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D3974042 |archive-url= http://www.freezepage.com/1312259439DCNZUBYRBU?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D3974042 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= August 2, 2011 |title= Haynesworth Indicted on Traffic Charges |publisher=ESPN | date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=August 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an accident on [[Interstate 65]], Corey Edmonson was partially paralyzed after colliding with Haynesworth's car. Haynesworth was driving his Ferrari at speeds in excess of 100&amp;nbsp;mph when he struck Edmonson's vehicle, which struck a concrete barrier.&lt;ref name="bleacher"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/397200-albert-haynesworths-lawsuit-is-another-headache-for-washington-redskins |title=Albert Haynesworth's Lawsuit Is Another Headache for Washington Redskins |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d4KMONy?url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/397200-albert-haynesworths-lawsuit-is-another-headache-for-washington-redskins |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 2010, it was reported that Clayton Bank &amp; Trust was suing the NFL lineman, alleging that Haynesworth had failed to make payments on a loan in the amount of more than $2.38 million. The suit was filed in the Knox County Chancery Court on June 18, 2010. According to papers, Haynesworth entered a commercial [[loan agreement]] for the original principal amount of $2,381,688.58 on June 27, 2009. On February 27, 2009, the two parties entered into an Extension Agreement with an effective date of February 27, 2010, according to the suit. The attorney for Clayton Bank &amp; Trust, Hugh B. Ward, Jr., was seeking a little over $2.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/redskinsinsider/albert-haynesworth/albert-haynesworth-sued-by-ten.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Albert Haynesworth sued by Tennessee bank |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d4ZQpaA?url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/redskinsinsider/albert-haynesworth/albert-haynesworth-sued-by-ten.html |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Silvia Mena, a stripper from [[New York City|New York]], claimed in a $10 million lawsuit that Haynesworth impregnated her and left her with no financial assistance.&lt;ref name="bleacher" /&gt;

In 2011, Haynesworth allegedly threw a punch to the nose of Joel Velazques, 38, of [[Leesburg, Virginia]] during a traffic altercation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=6090069 |title=Albert Haynesworth accused in Virginia |date=February 4, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d4bDxGi?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=6090069 |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Haynesworth plead guilty for reckless boating charges.

[[File:Spike HH 2.png|thumb|Fig 1. A neuronal action potential ("spike"). Note that the amplitude and the exact shape of the action potential can vary according to the exact experimental technique used for acquiring the signal.]]
A '''biological neuron model''', also known as a '''spiking neuron model''', is a mathematical description of the properties of certain cells in the nervous system that generate sharp electrical potentials [[membrane potential|across their cell membrane]], roughly one millisecond in duration, as shown in Fig. 1.   Spiking [[neuron]]s are known to be a major signaling unit of the [[nervous system]], and for this reason characterizing their operation is of great importance. It is worth noting that not all the cells of the nervous system produce the type of spike that define the scope of the spiking neuron models. For example, [[cochlea]]r [[hair cells]], retinal receptor cells, and [[retinal bipolar cell]]s do not spike. Furthermore, many cells in the nervous system are not classified as neurons but instead are classified as [[glial cell|glia]].

[[File:Whole Cell Patch Clamp.png|thumb|311x311px|Fig 2. "Whole cell" measurement technique, which captures the spiking activity of a single neuron and produces full amplitude action potentials.]]
Ultimately, biological neuron models aim to explain the mechanisms underlying the operation of the nervous system for the purpose of restoring lost control capabilities such as [[perception]] (e.g. deafness or blindness), motor movement [[decision making]], and continuous [[motor control|limb control]]. In that sense, biological neuron models differ from [[artificial neuron]] models that do not presume to predict the outcomes of experiments involving the biological neural tissue (although artificial neuron models are also concerned with execution of  perception and estimation tasks). Accordingly, an important aspect of biological neuron models is experimental validation, and the use of physical units to describe the experimental procedure associated with the model predictions.

Neuron models can be divided into two categories according to the physical units of the interface of the model. Each category could be further divided according to the abstraction/detail level: 
# [[#ElectricalModels|Electrical input–output membrane voltage models]] – These models produce a prediction for membrane output voltage as function of electrical stimulation at the input stage (either voltage or current). The various models in this category differ in the exact functional relationship between the input current and the output voltage and in the level of details. Some models in this category are black box models and distinguish only between two measured voltage levels: the presence of a spike (also known as "action potential") or a quiescent state. Other models are more detailed and account for sub-cellular processes.  
# [[#NaturalModels|Natural]] or [[#PharmacologicalModels|pharmacological input neuron models]] – The models in this category connect between the input stimulus which can be either pharmacological or natural, to the probability of a spike event. The input stage of  these models is not electrical, but rather has either pharmacological (chemical) concentration units, or physical units that characterize an external stimulus such as light, sound or other forms of physical pressure. Furthermore, the output stage represents the probability of a spike event and not an electrical voltage. Typically, this output probability is normalized (divided by) a time constant, and the resulting normalized probability is called the "firing rate" and has units of Hertz.  The probabilistic description taken by the models in this category was inspired from laboratory experiments involving either natural or pharmacological stimulation which exhibit variability in the resulting spike pattern. Nevertheless, when averaging these experimental results across several trials,  a clear pattern is often revealed. 
[[File:Multi unit measurement.png|thumb|304x304px|Fig 3. Extracellular measurement: Captures spikes with lower amplitudes, often from several spiking sources, depending on the size of the electrode and its proximity to the sources. Despite the decreased amplitude levels produced by this technique, it also has several advantages: 1) Is easier to obtain experimentally; 2) Is robust and lasts for a longer time; 3) Can reflect the dominant effect, especially when conducted in an anatomical region with many similar cells.]]

Although it is not unusual in science and engineering to have several descriptive models for different abstraction/detail levels, the number of different, sometimes contradicting, biological neuron models is exceptionally high. This situation is partly the result of the many different experimental settings, and the difficulty to separate the intrinsic properties of a single neuron from measurements effects and interactions of many cells ([[Biological neural network|network]] effects). To accelerate the convergence to a unified theory, we list several models in each category, and where applicable, also references to supporting experiments.

== Electrical input–output membrane voltage models {{anchor|ElectricalModels}} ==
The models in this category describe the relationship between neuronal membrane currents at the input stage, and membrane voltage at the output stage. The most extensive experimental inquiry in this category of models was made by Hodgkin–Huxley in the early 1950s using an experimental setup that punctured the cell membrane and allowed to force a specific membrane voltage/current.

Most modern  [[#ElectricalApplications|electrical neural interfaces]] apply extra-cellular electrical stimulation to avoid membrane puncturing which can lead to cell death and tissue damage. Hence, it is not clear to what extent the electrical neuron models hold for extra-cellular stimulation (see e.g.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathieson|first=Keith|last2=Loudin|first2=James|last3=Goetz|first3=Georges|last4=Huie|first4=Philip|last5=Wang|first5=Lele|last6=Kamins|first6=Theodore I.|last7=Galambos|first7=Ludwig|last8=Smith|first8=Richard|last9=Harris|first9=James S.|date=2012-12-01|title=Photovoltaic retinal prosthesis with high pixel density|url=http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v6/n12/full/nphoton.2012.327.html|journal=Nature Photonics|volume=6|issue=12|pages=872–872|doi=10.1038/nphoton.2012.327|issn=1749-4885|pmc=3462820|bibcode=2012NaPho...6..872M}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Integrate-and-fire===
One of the earliest models of a neuron was first investigated in 1907 by [[Louis Lapicque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbott |first=L.F. |authorlink= |vauthors= |date=1999 |title=Lapique's introduction of the integrate-and-fire model neuron (1907) |journal=Brain Research Bulletin |volume=50 |issue=5/6 |pages=303–304 |id= |url=http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~larry/AbbottBrResBul99.pdf |accessdate=2007-11-24 |quote= |doi=10.1016/S0361-9230(99)00161-6 |pmid=10643408 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613230629/http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~larry/AbbottBrResBul99.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A neuron is represented in time by

:&lt;math&gt;I(t)=C_\mathrm{m} \frac{d V_\mathrm{m}(t)}{d t}&lt;/math&gt;

which is just the time [[derivative]] of the law of [[Capacitor#Capacitance|capacitance]], {{math|''Q'' {{=}} ''CV''}}. When an input current is applied, the membrane voltage increases with time until it reaches a constant threshold {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;}}, at which point a [[Dirac delta function|delta function]] spike occurs and the voltage is reset to its resting potential, after which the model continues to run. The ''firing frequency'' of the model thus increases linearly without bound as input current increases.

The model can be made more accurate by introducing a [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;}} that limits the firing frequency of a neuron by preventing it from firing during that period. Through some calculus involving a [[Fourier transform]], the firing frequency as a function of a constant input current thus looks like

:&lt;math&gt;\,\! f(I)= \frac{I} {C_\mathrm{m} V_\mathrm{th} + t_\mathrm{ref} I}&lt;/math&gt;.

A remaining shortcoming of this model is that it implements no time-dependent memory. If the model receives a below-threshold signal at some time, it will retain that voltage boost forever until it fires again. This characteristic is clearly not in line with observed neuronal behavior.

is a model of the relationship between ion currents crossing the neuronal cell membrane and the membrane voltage.&lt;ref name="Hod52" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; The model is based on experiments that allowed to force membrane voltage using an intra-cellular pipette.  This model is based on the concept of membrane ion channels and relies on data from the [[squid giant axon]]. Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this model.

We note as before our voltage-current relationship, this time generalized to include multiple voltage-dependent currents:

:&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{m} \frac{d V(t)}{d t} = -\sum_i I_i (t, V)&lt;/math&gt;.

Each current is given by [[Ohm's Law]] as

:&lt;math&gt;I(t,V) = g(t,V)\cdot(V-V_\mathrm{eq})&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''g''(''t'',''V'')}} is the [[Electrical conductance|conductance]], or inverse resistance, which can be expanded in terms of its constant average {{math|''ḡ''}} &lt;!-- \bar{g} --&gt; and the activation and inactivation fractions {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''h''}}, respectively, that determine how many ions can flow through available membrane channels. This expansion is given by

:&lt;math&gt;g(t,V)=\bar{g}\cdot m(t,V)^p \cdot h(t,V)^q&lt;/math&gt;

and our fractions follow the first-order kinetics

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d m(t,V)}{d t} = \frac{m_\infty(V)-m(t,V)}{\tau_\mathrm{m} (V)} = \alpha_\mathrm{m} (V)\cdot(1-m) - \beta_\mathrm{m} (V)\cdot m&lt;/math&gt;

with similar dynamics for {{math|''h''}}, where we can use either {{math|''τ''}} and {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}} to define our gate fractions.

With such a form, all that remains is to individually investigate each current one wants to include. Typically, these include inward Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; input currents and several varieties of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; outward currents, including a "leak" current.

The end result can be at the small end 20 parameters which one must estimate or measure for an accurate model, and for complex systems of neurons not easily tractable by computer. Careful simplifications of the Hodgkin–Huxley model are therefore needed.

===Leaky integrate-and-fire&lt;!-- Please insert experimental evidence supporting this model --&gt;===
In the leaky integrate-and-fire model, the memory problem is solved by adding a "leak" term to the membrane potential, reflecting the diffusion of ions that occurs through the membrane when some equilibrium is not reached in the cell. The model looks like

:&lt;math&gt;I(t)-\frac{V_\mathrm{m} (t)}{R_\mathrm{m}} = C_\mathrm{m} \frac{d V_\mathrm{m} (t)}{d t}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the membrane resistance, as we find it is not a perfect insulator as assumed previously. This forces the input current to exceed some threshold {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''V''&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; / ''R''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} in order to cause the cell to fire, else it will simply leak out any change in potential. The firing frequency thus looks like

:&lt;math&gt;f(I) =
\begin{cases} 
  0,  &amp; I \le I_\mathrm{th} \\
  {[} t_\mathrm{ref}-R_\mathrm{m} C_\mathrm{m} \log(1-\tfrac{V_\mathrm{th}}{I R_\mathrm{m}}) {]}^{-1}, &amp; I &gt; I_\mathrm{th} 
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

which converges for large input currents to the previous leak-free model with refractory period.&lt;ref name="Koch98"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koch|first1=Christof|title=Methods in neuronal modeling : from ions to networks|year=1999|pages=687|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-11231-4|url=http://www.klab.caltech.edu/MNM/|edition=2nd|last2=Segev|first2=Idan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent advances in computational and theoretical fractional calculus lead to a new form of model, called Fractional-Order Leaky integrate-and-fire developed by Teka et al.

The [[Galves-Löcherbach model]] is a specific development of the leaky integrate-and-fire model. It is inherently [[stochasticity|stochastic]]. It was developed by mathematicians [[Antonio Galves]] and [[Eva Löcherbach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galves | first1 = A. | last2 = Löcherbach | first2 = E. | year = 2013 | title = Infinite Systems of Interacting Chains with Memory of Variable Length — A Stochastic Model for Biological Neural Nets | url = | journal = Journal of Statistical Physics | volume = 151 | issue = 5| pages = 896–921 | doi=10.1007/s10955-013-0733-9| arxiv = 1212.5505 | bibcode = 2013JSP...151..896G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Given the model specifications, the probability that a given neuron &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; spikes in a time period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; may be described by

where &lt;math&gt;W_{j \rightarrow i}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[synaptic weight]], describing the influence of neuron &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; on neuron &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_j&lt;/math&gt; expresses the leak, and &lt;math&gt;L_t^i&lt;/math&gt; provides the spiking history of neuron &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; before &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, according to

Sweeping simplifications to Hodgkin–Huxley were introduced by FitzHugh and Nagumo in 1961 and 1962. Seeking to describe "regenerative self-excitation" by a nonlinear positive-feedback membrane voltage and recovery by a linear negative-feedback gate voltage, they developed the model described by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}

  \tau \dfrac{d w}{d t} &amp;=&amp; V-a-b w

===Hindmarsh–Rose&lt;!-- Please insert experimental evidence supporting this model --&gt;===
{{main|Hindmarsh–Rose model}}
Building upon the FitzHugh–Nagumo model, Hindmarsh and Rose proposed in 1984 a model of neuronal activity described by three coupled first order differential equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
  \dfrac{d x}{d t} &amp;=&amp; y+3x^2-x^3-z+I \\ \\
  \dfrac{d y}{d t} &amp;=&amp; 1-5x^2-y \\ \\
  \dfrac{d z}{d t} &amp;=&amp; r\cdot (4(x + \tfrac{8}{5})-z)
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|''r'' ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; }} so that the {{math|''z''}} variable only changes very slowly. This extra mathematical complexity allows a great variety of dynamic behaviors for the membrane potential, described by the {{math|''x''}} variable of the model, which include chaotic dynamics. This makes the Hindmarsh–Rose neuron model very useful, because being still simple, allows a good qualitative description of the many different patterns of the action potential observed in experiments.

===Cable theory&lt;!-- Please insert experimental evidence supporting this model --&gt;===
{{see also|Cable theory}}
Cable theory describes the [[dendrites|dendritic arbor]] as a cylindrical structure undergoing a regular pattern of [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]], like branches in a tree. For a single cylinder or an entire tree, the input conductance at the base (where the tree meets the cell body, or any such boundary) is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;G_{in} = \frac{G_\infty \tanh(L) + G_L}{1+(G_L / G_\infty )\tanh(L)}&lt;/math&gt;,

where {{math|''L''}} is the electrotonic length of the cylinder which depends on its length, diameter, and resistance. A simple recursive algorithm scales linearly with the number of branches and can be used to calculate the effective conductance of the tree. This is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\,\! G_D = G_m A_D \tanh(L_D) / L_D&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''πld''}} is the total surface area of the tree of total length {{math|''l''}}, and {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is its total electrotonic length. For an entire neuron in which the cell body conductance is {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the membrane conductance per unit area is {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;''md''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''A''}}, we find the total neuron conductance {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for {{math|''n''}} dendrite trees by adding up all tree and soma conductances, given by

:&lt;math&gt;G_N = G_S + \sum_{j=1}^n A_{D_j} F_{dga_j}&lt;/math&gt;,

where we can find the general correction factor {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''dga''&lt;/sub&gt;}} experimentally by noting {{math|''G''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''md''&lt;/sub&gt;''A''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''dga''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

===Compartmental models&lt;!-- Please insert experimental evidence supporting this model --&gt;===
{{see also|Multi-compartment model}}
The cable model makes a number of simplifications to give closed analytic results, namely that the dendritic arbor must branch in diminishing pairs in a fixed pattern. A compartmental model allows for any desired tree topology with arbitrary branches and lengths, but makes simplifications in the interactions between branches to compensate. Thus, the two models give complementary results, neither of which is necessarily more accurate.

Each individual piece, or compartment, of a dendrite is modeled by a straight cylinder of arbitrary length {{math|''l''}} and diameter {{math|''d''}} which connects with fixed resistance to any number of branching cylinders. We define the conductance ratio of the {{math|''i''}}th cylinder as {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''G''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where &lt;math&gt;G_\infty=\tfrac{\pi d^{3/2}}{2\sqrt{R_i R_m}}&lt;/math&gt; and {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the resistance between the current compartment and the next. We obtain a series of equations for conductance ratios in and out of a compartment by making corrections to the normal dynamic {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;out,''i''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;in,''i+1''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, as

*&lt;math&gt;B_{\mathrm{out},i} = \frac{B_{\mathrm{in},i+1}(d_{i+1}/d_i)^{3/2} }{ \sqrt{R_{\mathrm{m},i+1}/R_{\mathrm{m},i}} }&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;B_{\mathrm{in},i} = \frac{ B_{\mathrm{out},i} + \tanh X_i }{ 1+B_{\mathrm{out},i}\tanh X_i }&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;B_\mathrm{out,par} = \frac{B_\mathrm{in,dau1} (d_\mathrm{dau1}/d_\mathrm{par})^{3/2}} {\sqrt{R_\mathrm{m,dau1}/R_\mathrm{m,par}}} + \frac{B_\mathrm{in,dau2} (d_\mathrm{dau2}/d_\mathrm{par})^{3/2}} {\sqrt{R_\mathrm{m,dau2}/R_\mathrm{m,par}}} + \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

where the last equation deals with ''parents'' and ''daughters'' at branches, and &lt;math&gt;X_i = \tfrac{l_i \sqrt{4R_i}}{\sqrt{d_i R_m}}&lt;/math&gt;. We can iterate these equations through the tree until we get the point where the dendrites connect to the cell body (soma), where the conductance ratio is {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;in,stem&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Then our total neuron conductance is given by

:&lt;math&gt;G_N = \frac{A_\mathrm{soma}}{R_\mathrm{m,soma}} + \sum_j B_{\mathrm{in,stem},j} G_{\infty,j}&lt;/math&gt;.

The models in this category were derived following experiments involving natural stimulation such as light, sound, touch, or odor. In these experiments, the spike pattern resulting from each stimulus presentation varies from trial to trial, but the averaged response from several trials often converges to a clear pattern. Consequently, the models in this category generate a probabilistic relationship between the input stimulus to spike occurrences.

&lt;math&gt;P_{spike}(t\in[t',t'+\Delta_t])=\Delta_t \cdot g[s(t)]&lt;/math&gt;

Siebert considered several functions as &lt;math&gt;g[s(t)]&lt;/math&gt;, including &lt;math&gt;g[s(t)] \propto s^2(t)&lt;/math&gt; for low stimulus intensities.

The main advantage of Siebert's model is its simplicity. The shortcomings of the model is its inability to reflect properly the following phenomena:
* The edge emphasizing property of the neuron in response to a stimulus pulse.
* The saturation of the firing rate.
* The values of inter-spike-interval-'''histogram''' at short intervals values (close to zero).
These shortcoming are addressed by the two state Markov Model.&lt;ref name="Nossenson_Messer_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NossensonMesser2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NossensonMagalMesser2016"/&gt;

The connection between the external stimulus to the spiking probability is made in two steps: First, a receptor cell model translates the raw external stimulus to neurotransmitter concentration, then, a spiking neuron model connects between neurotransmitter concentration to the firing rate (spiking probability).  Thus, the spiking neuron model by itself depends on neurotransmitter concentration at the input stage.&lt;ref name="Nossenson_Messer_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NossensonMesser2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NossensonMagalMesser2016"/&gt;

An important feature of this model is the prediction for neurons firing rate pattern which captures, using a low number of free parameters, the characteristic edge emphasized response of neurons to a stimulus pulse, as shown in Fig. 5. The firing rate is identified both as a normalized probability for neural spike firing, and as a quantity proportional to the current of neurotransmitters released by the cell. The expression for the firing rate takes the following  form:

&lt;math&gt;R_{fire}(t)=\frac{P_{spike}(t;\Delta_t)}{\Delta_t}=[y(t)+R_0] \cdot P_0(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where, 
* P0 is the probability of the neuron to be "armed" and ready to fire. It is given by the following differential equation:

&lt;math&gt;\dot{P}_0=-[y(t)+R_0+R_1] \cdot P_0(t) +R_1&lt;/math&gt;

P0 could be generally calculated recursively using Euler method, but in the case of a pulse of stimulus it yields a simple closed form expression.&lt;ref name="Nossenson_Messer_2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NossensonPhD2013"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://primage.tau.ac.il/libraries/theses/exeng/free/2531730.pdf|title=Model Based Detection of a Stimulus Presence from Neurophysiological Signals|last=Nossenson|first=Nir|publisher=PhD diss, University of Tel-Aviv|year=2013|isbn=|location=The Neiman Library of Exact Sciences &amp; Engineering, Tel Aviv University|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* y(t) is the input of the model and is interpreted as the neurotransmitter concentration on the cell surrounding (in most cases glutamate) . For  an external stimulus it can be estimated through the receptor layer model:

&lt;math&gt;y(t) \simeq   g_{gain} \cdot \langle s^2(t)\rangle&lt;/math&gt; , with &lt;math&gt;\langle s^2(t)\rangle &lt;/math&gt; being short temporal average of stimulus power (given in Watt or other energy per time unit).
* R0 corresponds to the intrinsic spontaneous firing rate of the neuron.
* R1 is the recovery rate of the neuron from refractory state.

Other predictions by this model include:

1) The averaged Evoked Response Potential (ERP) due to population of many neurons in unfiltered measurements resembles the firing rate.&lt;ref name="NossensonMagalMesser2016"/&gt;

2) The voltage variance of activity due to multiple neuron activity resembles the firing rate (also known as Multi-Unit-Activity power or MUA).&lt;ref name="NossensonMesser2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NossensonMagalMesser2016"/&gt;

3) The inter-spike-interval probability distribution takes the form a gamma-distribution like function.&lt;ref name="Nossenson_Messer_2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NossensonPhD2013" /&gt;

=== Synaptic transmission (Koch &amp; Segev)===
{{see also|Neurotransmission}}
According to the model by Koch and Segev,&lt;ref name="Koch98"/&gt; the response of a neuron to individual neurotransmitters can be modeled as an extension of the classical Hodgkin–Huxley model with both standard and nonstandard kinetic currents. Four neurotransmitters primarily have influence in the CNS. [[AMPA receptor|AMPA/kainate receptors]] are fast [[Excitatory synapse|excitatory]] mediators while [[NMDA receptor]]s mediate considerably slower currents. Fast [[Inhibitory synapse|inhibitory]] currents go through [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors]], while [[GABAB receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors]] mediate by secondary ''G''-protein-activated potassium channels. This range of mediation produces the following current dynamics:

*&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{AMPA}(t,V) = \bar{g}_\mathrm{AMPA} \cdot [O] \cdot (V(t)-E_\mathrm{AMPA})&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{NMDA}(t,V) = \bar{g}_\mathrm{NMDA} \cdot B(V) \cdot [O] \cdot (V(t)-E_\mathrm{NMDA})&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{GABA_A}(t,V) = \bar{g}_\mathrm{GABA_A} \cdot ([O_1]+[O_2]) \cdot (V(t)-E_\mathrm{Cl})&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{GABA_B}(t,V) = \bar{g}_\mathrm{GABA_B} \cdot \tfrac{[G]^n}{[G]^n+K_\mathrm{d}} \cdot (V(t)-E_\mathrm{K})&lt;/math&gt;

== Relation between artificial and biological neuron models ==
The most basic model of a neuron consists of an input with some [[synaptic weight]] vector and an [[activation function]] or [[transfer function]] inside the neuron determining output. This is the basic structure used for artificial neurons, which in a [[artificial neural network|neural network]] often looks like

&lt;math&gt;y_i = \phi\left( \sum_j w_{ij} x_j \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the output of the {{math|''i''}} th neuron, {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the {{math|''j''}}th input neuron signal, {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the synaptic weight (or strength of connection) between the neurons {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}}, and {{math|''φ''}} is the [[activation function]]. While this model has seen success in machine-learning applications, it is a poor model for real (biological) neurons, because it lacks the time-dependence that real neuron spikes exhibit. Biological models of the "integrate-and-fire" type take essentially this form; but they have largely been superseded by kinetic models such as the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In the case of modelling a biological neuron, physical analogues are used in place of abstractions such as "weight" and "transfer function". A neuron is filled and surrounded with water containing ions, which carry electric charge. The neuron is bound by an insulating cell membrane and can maintain a concentration of charged ions on either side that determines a [[capacitance]] {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The firing of a neuron involves the movement of ions into the cell that occurs when [[neurotransmitters]] cause [[ion channels]] on the cell membrane to open. We describe this by a physical time-dependent [[Electric current|current]] {{math|''I''(''t'')}}. With this comes a change in [[voltage]], or the electrical potential energy difference between the cell and its surroundings, which is observed to sometimes result in a [[voltage spike]] called an [[action potential]] which travels the length of the cell and triggers the release of further neurotransmitters. The voltage, then, is the quantity of interest and is given by {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}}.

==Conjectures regarding the role of the neuron in the wider context of the brain principle of operation ==

=== The neurotransmitter based energy detection scheme ===
The neurotransmitter based energy detection scheme&lt;ref name="NossensonMagalMesser2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NossensonPhD2013" /&gt;  suggests that the neural tissue chemically executes a Radar-like detection procedure.

[[File:Neural detector nossenson 2013.png|thumb|611x411px|Fig. 6 The biological neural detection scheme as suggested by Nossenson et al&lt;ref name="NossensonMagalMesser2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NossensonPhD2013" /&gt;]]

As shown in Fig. 6, the key idea of the conjecture is to account neurotransmitter concentration, neurotransmitter generation and neurotransmitter removal rates as the important quantities in executing the detection task, while referring to the measured electrical potentials as a side effect that only in certain conditions coincide with the functional purpose of each step.  The detection scheme is similar to  a radar like "energy detection" because it includes signal squaring, temporal summation and a threshold switch mechanism,
just like the energy detector, but it also includes a unit that emphasizes stimulus edges and a variable memory length (variable memory). According to this conjecture, the physiological equivalent of the energy test statistics is neurotransmitter concentration, and the firing rate corresponds to neurotransmitter current. The advantage of this interpretation is that it leads to a unit consistent explanation which allows to bridge between electrophysiological measurements, biochemical measurements and psychophysical results.

The evidence reviewed in&lt;ref name="NossensonMagalMesser2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NossensonPhD2013" /&gt; suggest the following association between functionality to histological classification:
# Stimulus squaring is likely to be performed by receptor cells.
# Stimulus edge emphasizing and signal transduction is performed by neurons.
# Temporal accumulation of neurotransmitters is performed by glia cells. Short term neurotransmitter accumulation is likely to occur also in some types of neurons.
# Logical switching is executed by glia cells, and it results from exceeding a threshold level of neurotransmitter concentration. This threshold crossing is also accompanied by a change in neurotransmitter leak rate.
# Physical all-or-non movement switching is due to muscle cells and results from exceeding a certain neurotransmitter concentration threshold on muscle surroundings.

Note that although the electrophysiological signals in Fig.6 are often similar to the functional signal (signal power / neurotransmitter concentration / muscle force), there are some stages in which the electrical observation is different from the functional purpose of the corresponding step. In particular, Nossenson et al suggested that glia threshold crossing has a completely different functional operation compared to the radiated electrophysiological signal, and that the latter might only be a side effect of glia break.

==General comments regarding the modern perspective of scientific and engineering models==
* The models above are still idealizations. Corrections must be made for the increased membrane surface area given by numerous dendritic spines, temperatures significantly hotter than room-temperature experimental data, and nonuniformity in the cell's internal structure.&lt;ref name="Koch98"/&gt; Certain observed effects do not fit into some of these models. For instance, the temperature cycling (with minimal net temperature increase) of the cell membrane during action potential propagation not compatible with models which rely on modeling the membrane as a resistance which must dissipate energy when current flows through it. The transient thickening of the cell membrane during action potential propagation is also not predicted by these models, nor is the changing capacitance and voltage spike that results from this thickening incorporated into these models. The action of some anesthetics such as inert gases is problematic for these models as well. New models, such as the [[soliton model]] attempt to explain these phenomena, but are less developed than older models and have yet to be widely applied.
* Modern views regarding of the role of the scientific model suggest that  "All models are wrong but some are useful" (Box and Draper, 1987, Gribbin, 2009; Paninski et al., 2009).
*Recent conjecture suggests that each neuron might function as a collection of independent threshold units. It is suggested that a neuron could be anisotropically activated following the origin of its arriving signals to the membrane, via its dendritic trees. The spike waveform was also proposed to be dependent on the origin of the stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sardi|first=Shira|last2=Vardi|first2=Roni|last3=Sheinin|first3=Anton|last4=Goldental|first4=Amir|last5=Kanter|first5=Ido|date=December 2017|title=New Types of Experiments Reveal that a Neuron Functions as Multiple Independent Threshold Units|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-18363-1|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2017NatSR...718036S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4424">'''''Cantabile''''' is a work composed from 2004 to 2009 by [[Frederik Magle]]. It consists of three symphonic poems (or movements) based on poems written by [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Henrik, the Prince Consort of Denmark]] published in his book [[Cantabile (book)|Cantabile]]. The Cantabile suite was commissioned by the [[Danish Royal Family]] and the first movement was premiered in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Komponist for prins Henrik | newspaper= [[Berlingske Tidende]] | date= June 10, 2004| url= http://www.berlingske.dk/kultur/komponist-prins-henrik| accessdate= 2011-12-29 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Henrik bag musik for prins Henrik | publisher= [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV2 Nyhederne]] | date= June 10, 2004| url= http://nyhederne-dyn.tv2.dk/article.php/id-921520:henrik-bag-musik-for-prins-henrik.html| accessdate= 2011-12-30 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third movements were premiered on June 10, 2009 at a concert in the [[Copenhagen Concert Hall]] celebrating Prince Henrik's 75th birthday. On both occasions the music was performed by the [[Danish National Symphony Orchestra]] and Choir, conducted by [[Thomas Dausgaard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=HKH Prinsgemalens 75-års Galla | url=http://www.dr.dk/Koncerthuset/Kalender/2009/juni/20090403115551.htm |  publisher = [[DR (broadcaster)|DR - Danish Broadcasting Corporation]] | accessdate=2011-10-11 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music alternates between the sorrowful, which - according to the Prince Consort's biography (2010) - being unexpected at a birthday concert, caused unease among some of the guests present at the first performance of the ''Cortège &amp; Danse Macabre'' in 2009, and sudden bursts of humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Besides the original text by Prince Henrik in [[French language|French]], a Danish translation by [[Per Aage Brandt]] is also used in the work, and at places French and Danish is being sung at the same time.

==Structure==
The three symphonic poems/movements forming the suite are:

{{Atheism sidebar}}
'''Charvaka''' ([[IAST]]: '''Cārvāka'''), originally known as '''Lokāyata''' and '''Bṛhaspatya''', is the ancient school of Indian [[materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/govind-pansare-mm-kalburgi-gauri-lankesh-murder-5316465/ |title=Indian rationalism, Charvaka to Narendra Dabholkar |author=Seema Chishti |date=21 August 2018 |website=The Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charvaka holds [[direct perception]], [[empiricism]], and conditional [[inference]] as proper sources of knowledge, embraces [[philosophical skepticism]] and rejects [[Vedas]], [[Vedic ritualism]], and [[supernaturalism]].{{sfn|Tiwari|1998|p=67}}{{sfn|Perrett|1984|pp=161-174}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=21–32}}{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|pp=187, 227–234}}{{sfn|Flint|1899|p=463}}{{efn|"Aside from nontheistic schools like the [[Samkhya]], there have also been explicitly atheistic schools in the Hindu tradition. One virulently anti-supernatural system is/was the so-called Charvaka school."{{sfn|Raman|2012|pp=549–574}} }}

[[Ajita Kesakambali]] is credited as the forerunner of the Charvakas,{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=26-29}} while Brihaspati is usually referred to as the founder of Charvaka or Lokāyata philosophy.{{sfn|Quack|2011|p=50|ps=:See footnote 3}} Much of the primary literature of Charvaka, the [[Barhaspatya sutras]] (ca. 600 BCE), are missing or lost.{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|pp=227–249}} Its teachings have been compiled from historic secondary literature such as those found in the [[shastra]]s, [[sutra]]s, and the [[Indian epic poetry]] as well as in the dialogues of [[Gautama Buddha]] and from [[Jain literature]].{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|pp=227–249}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=21–44, 65–74}}

One of the widely studied principles of Charvaka philosophy was its rejection of [[inference]] as a means to establish valid, universal knowledge, and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] truths.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=5}}{{sfn| Bhattacharya|2011|p=58}} In other words, the Charvaka epistemology states that whenever one infers a truth from a set of observations or truths, one must acknowledge doubt; inferred knowledge is conditional.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}}

Charvaka is categorized as a [[heterodox]] school of [[Indian philosophy]].{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|pp=1–3, Contents}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=224}} It is considered an example of atheistic schools in the [[Hinduism|Hindu tradition]].{{efn|"some of the ancient Hindu traditions like Charvaka have a rich tradition of materialism, in general, other schools..."{{sfn|Thomas|2014|pp=164-165}} }}{{sfn|Raman |2012|pp=549–574}}{{efn|"Of the three heterodox systems, the remaining one, the Cārvāka system, is a Hindu system."{{sfn|Tiwari|1998|=67}} }}{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=84}}{{efn|For a general discussion of Charvaka and other atheistic traditions within Hindu philosophy, see {{harvnb|Frazier|2013|p=367}} }}

==Etymology and meaning==
The etymology of Charvaka (Sanskrit: चार्वाक) is uncertain. Bhattacharya quotes the grammarian [[Hemacandra]], to the effect that the word cārvāka is derived from the root carv, ‘to chew’ (which he misspells as carva): “A Cārvāka chews the self (carvatyātmānaṃ cārvākaḥ). Hemacandra refers to his own grammatical work, Uṇādisūtra 37, which runs as follows: mavāka-śyāmāka-vārtāka-jyontāka-gūvāka-bhadrākādayaḥ. Each of these words ends with the āka suffix and is formed irregularly.”{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=166–167}} This may also allude to the philosophy's hedonistic precepts of "eat, drink, and be merry".{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=27}}

Others believe it to mean "agreeable speech" or pejoratively, "sweet-tongued", from Sanskrit's {{IAST|cāru}} "agreeable" and {{IAST|[[vāc]]}} "speech" (which becomes {{IAST|[[vāk]]}} in the nominative singular and in compounds). Yet another hypothesis is that it is eponymous, with the founder of the school being Charvaka, a disciple of Brihaspati.{{sfn|Sharma|1987|p=40}}

===As Lokayata===
According to {{harvnb|Chattopadhyaya|1992|p=1}}, the traditional name of Charvaka is Lokayata. It was called Lokayata because it was prevalent (''ayatah'') among the people (''lokesu''), and meant the world-outlook of the people. The dictionary meaning of Lokāyata (लोकायत) signifies "directed towards, aiming at the world, worldly".{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=27}}{{efn|See ''loka'' and ''ayata'', Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany; (लोक, loka which means "worlds, abode, place of truth, people", and आयत, āyata means "extended, directed towards, aiming at"{{sfn|Stöwe|2003}} }}

In early to mid 20th century literature, the etymology of ''Lokayata'' has been given different interpretations, in part because the primary sources are unavailable, and the meaning has been deduced from divergent secondary literature.{{sfn| Bhattacharya|2011|pp=187–192}} The name Lokāyata, for example, is found in [[Chanakya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'', which refers to three ''ānvīkṣikīs'' (अन्वीक्षिकी, literally, examining by reason,{{sfn|Hacker|1978|p=164}} logical philosophies) – [[Raja Yoga|Yoga]], [[Samkhya]] and Lokāyata. However, Lokāyata in the Arthashastra is not anti-Vedic, but implies Lokāyata to be a part of Vedic lore.{{sfn| Bhattacharya|2011|pp=188–190}} Lokāyata here refers to logic or science of debate (''disputatio'', "criticism").{{sfn| Bhattacharya|2011|pp=27, 189–191}} Rudolf Franke translated ''Lokayata'' in German as "logisch beweisende Naturerklärung", that is "logically proving explanation of nature".{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|p=188}}

In 8th century CE Jaina literature, ''Saddarsanasamuccaya'' by Haribhadra,{{sfn|Chapple|2003|p=2}} ''Lokayata'' is stated to be the Hindu school where there is "no God, no [[samsara]] (rebirth), no karma, no duty, no fruits of merit, no sin."{{sfn|Haribhadrasūri |1989|p=}}

The Buddhist Sanskrit work [[Divyavadana]] (ca. 200–350 CE) mentions ''Lokayata'', where it is listed among subjects of study, and with the sense of "technical logical science".{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=193–195}} [[Shantarakshita]] and [[Adi Shankara]] use the word ''lokayata'' to mean materialism,{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|pp=227–249}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=196}} with the latter using the term Lokāyata, not Charvaka.{{Sfn|Bhattacharya|2002|p=6}} The terms Lokayata and Brhaspatya have been used interchangeably for the Charvaka philosophy of materialism.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Origin==
The tenets of the Charvaka atheistic doctrines can be traced to the relatively later composed layers of the ''[[Rigveda]]'', while substantial discussions on the Charvaka is found in post-Vedic literature.{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|pp=227–249}}{{sfn|Koller|1977|pp=155-164}}{{efn|"These atheistical doctrines existed from the earliest times as their traces are visible even in the Rigveda in some hymns of which Prof Max Muller pointed out the curious traces of an incipient scepticism. (...) Two things are therefore clear that the Brihaspatya tenets also called Charvaka tenets are of a very old standing..."{{sfn|Vaidya|2001|p=503}} }} The primary literature of Charvaka, such as the ''Brhaspati Sutra'' is missing or lost.{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|pp=227–249}}{{sfn|Koller|1977|pp=155-164}} Its theories and development has been compiled from historic secondary literature such as those found in the shastras (such as the [[Arthashastra]]), sutras and the epics (the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Ramayana]]) of Hinduism as well as from the dialogues of Gautama Buddha and Jain literature.{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|pp=227–249}}{{sfn| Bhattacharya|2011|pp=21–44, 65–74}}

Substantial discussions about the Charvaka doctrines are only found in texts after 600 BCE.{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|pp=227–249}}{{sfn|Koller|1977|pp=155-164}}{{sfn|Riepe|1964|p=53-58}} Bhattacharya posits that Charvaka may have been one of several atheistic, materialist schools that existed in ancient India.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2013|p=133-149}} Though there is evidence of its development in Vedic era,{{sfn|Sinha|1994|pp=235-241}} Charvaka emerged as an alternative to the [[Āstika and nāstika|Āstika]] schools as well as a philosophical predecessor to subsequent or contemporaneous philosophies such as [[Ajñana]], [[Ājīvika]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] in the [[History of India#Late Middle Kingdoms — The Classical Age|classical period]] of Indian philosophy.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|p=9}}

The earliest documented Charvaka scholar in India is [[Ajita Kesakambali]]. Although materialist schools existed before Charvaka, it was the only school which systematised materialist philosophy by setting them down in the form of aphorisms in the 6th century BC. There was a base text, a collection sūtras or aphorisms and several commentaries were written to explicate the aphorisms.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}}

[[Edward Washburn Hopkins|E. W. Hopkins]], in his ''The Ethics of India'' (1924) claims that Charvaka philosophy was contemporaneous to Jainism and Buddhism, mentioning "the old Cārvāka or materialist of the 6th century BC". [[Rhys Davids]] assumes that ''lokāyata'' in ca. 500 BC came to mean "skepticism" in general without yet being organised as a philosophical school. Its methodology of skepticism is included in the ''[[Ramayana]]'', [[Ramayana#Ayodhya kanda|Ayodhya kanda]], chapter 108, where Jabāli tries to persuade [[Rama|Rāma]] to accept the kingdom by using nāstika arguments (Rāma refutes him in chapter 109):{{sfn|Schermerhorn |1930|pp=132-138}}
{{Quote|O, the highly wise! Arrive at a conclusion, therefore, that there is nothing beyond this Universe. Give precedence to that which meets the eye and turn your back on what is beyond our knowledge. (2.108.17)}}

There are alternate theories behind the origins of Charvaka. Bṛhaspati is sometimes referred to as the founder of Charvaka or Lokāyata philosophy. {{harvnb|Billington|1997|p=43}}states that a philosopher named Charvaka lived in or about the 6th century BC, who developed the premises of this Indian philosophy in the form of ''[[Barhaspatya sutras|Brhaspati Sutra]]''. These sutras predate 150 BC, because they are mentioned in the ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'' (7.3.45).{{sfn|Schermerhorn |1930|pp=132-138}}

{{harvnb|Basham|1981|pp=11-17}}, citing the Buddhist ''[[Samaññaphala Sutta]]'', suggests six schools of heterodox, pre-Buddhist and pre-Jain, atheistic Indian traditions in 6th century BCE, that included Charvakas and [[Ajivika]]s. Charvaka was a living philosophy up to the 12th century in India's [[Timeline of Indian history#13th century|historical timeline]], after which this system seems to have disappeared without leaving any trace.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=65–74}}

==Philosophy==
The Charvaka school of philosophy had a variety of atheistic and materialistic beliefs. They held perception to be the valid and reliable source of knowledge.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=3}}

===Epistemology===
The Charvaka [[epistemology]] holds perception as the primary and proper source of knowledge, while inference is held as prone to being either right or wrong and therefore conditional or invalid.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya |2010|pp=529-542}} Perceptions are of two types, for Charvaka, external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}} Inference is described as deriving a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths. To Charvakas, inference is useful but prone to error, as inferred truths can never be without doubt.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=55–67}} Inference is good and helpful, it is the validity of inference that is suspect – sometimes in certain cases and often in others. To the Charvakas there were no reliable means by which the efficacy of inference as a means of knowledge could be established.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=5}}

Charvaka's epistemological argument can be explained with the example of fire and smoke. Kamal states that when there is smoke ([[middle term]]), one's tendency may be to leap to the conclusion that it must be caused by fire ([[major term]] in logic).{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}} While this is often true, it need not be universally true, everywhere or all the times, stated the Charvaka scholars. Smoke can have other causes. In Charvaka epistemology, as long as the relation between two phenomena, or observation and truth, has not been proven as unconditional, it is an uncertain truth. Such methods of reasoning, that is jumping to conclusions or inference, is prone to flaw in this Indian philosophy.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=55–67}} Charvakas further state that full knowledge is reached when we know all observations, all premises and all conditions. But the absence of conditions, state Charvakas, can not be established beyond doubt by perception, as some conditions may be hidden or escape our ability to observe.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}} They acknowledge that every person relies on inference in daily life, but to them if we act uncritically, we err. While our inferences sometimes are true and lead to successful action, it is also a fact that sometimes inference is wrong and leads to error.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2013|p=133-149}} Truth then, state Charvaka, is not an unfailing character of inference, truth is merely an accident of inference, and one that is separable. We must be skeptics, question what we know by inference, question our epistemology.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}}{{sfn|Koller|1977|pp=155-164}}

This epistemological proposition of Charvakas was influential among various schools of in Indian philosophies, by demonstrating a new way of thinking and re-evaluation of past doctrines. Hindu, Buddhist and Jain scholars extensively deployed Charvaka insights on inference in rational re-examination of their own theories.{{sfn|Kamal|1998|pp=13-16}}{{sfn|Chatterjee |1977|pp=195-209}}

====Comparison with other schools of Hinduism====
Charvaka epistemology represents minimalist ''[[Pramana|pramāṇas]]'' (epistemological methods) in Hindu philosophy. The other schools of Hinduism developed and accepted multiple valid forms of epistemology.{{sfn|Deutsch|2001|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=238}} To Charvakas, ''Pratyakṣa'' (perception) was the one valid way to knowledge and other means of knowledge were either always conditional or invalid. Advaita [[Vedanta]] scholars considered six means of valid knowledge and to truths: ''Pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''Anumāṇa'' (inference), ''Upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy), ''Arthāpatti'' (postulation), ''Anupalabdhi'' (non-perception, cognitive proof) and ''Śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).{{sfn|Deutsch|2001|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=238}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}} While ''Charvaka'' school accepted just one, the valid means of epistemology in other schools of Hinduism ranged between 2 and 6.{{sfn|Deutsch|2001|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=238}}

===Metaphysics===
Since none of the means of knowing were found to be worthy to establish the invariable connection between middle term and predicate, Charvakas concluded that the inference could not be used to ascertain metaphysical truths. Thus, to Charvakas, the step which the mind takes from the knowledge of something to infer the knowledge of something else could be accounted for by its being based on a former perception or by its being in error. Cases where inference was justified by the result were seen only to be mere coincidences.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=9}}

Therefore, Charvakas denied metaphysical concepts like [[reincarnation]], an extracorporeal soul, the efficacy of [[Yajna|religious rites]], other worlds (heaven and hell), fate and accumulation of [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] or demerit through the performance of certain actions.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}} Charvakas also rejected the use of supernatural causes to describe natural phenomena. To them all natural phenomena was produced spontaneously from the inherent nature of things.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=10}}
{{Quote|The fire is hot, the water cold, refreshing cool the breeze of morn;&lt;br/&gt;By whom came this variety ? from their own nature was it born.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=10}} }}

===Consciousness and afterlife===
{{expand section|date=July 2015}}
The Charvaka did not believe in karma, rebirth or an [[afterlife]]. To them, all attributes that represented a person, such as thinness, fatness etc., resided in the body. The ''Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha'' states the Charvaka position as follows,{{sfn|Billington|1997|p=44}}
{{Quote|
There is no other world other than this;&lt;br&gt;
There is no heaven and no hell;&lt;br&gt;
The realm of Shiva and like regions,&lt;br&gt;
are fabricated by stupid imposters.
|Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha| Verse 8{{sfn|Billington|1997|p=44}} }}

===Pleasure===
{{Hedonism}}Charvaka believed that there was nothing wrong with [[sensual]] pleasure. Since it is impossible to have pleasure without pain, Charvaka thought that wisdom lay in enjoying pleasure and avoiding pain as far as possible. Unlike many of the Indian philosophies of the time, Charvaka did not believe in austerities or rejecting pleasure out of fear of pain and held such reasoning to be foolish.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=3}}

The ''Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha'' states the Charvaka position on pleasure and hedonism as follows,{{sfn|Billington|1997|pp=44-45}}
{{Quote|
The enjoyment of heaven lies in eating delicious food, keeping company of young women, using fine clothes, perfumes, garlands, sandal paste... while [[moksha]] is death which is cessation of life-breath... the wise therefore ought not to take pains on account of ''moksha''.

A fool wears himself out by penances and fasts. Chastity and other such ordinances are laid down by clever weaklings.
|Sarvasiddhanta Samgraha| Verses 9-12{{sfn|Billington|1997|p=45}}}}

===Religion===
Charvakas rejected many of the standard religious conceptions of Hindus, Buddhists and Jains, such as an [[afterlife]], [[reincarnation]], [[samsara]], [[karma]] and [[religious rite]]s. They were critical of the [[Vedas]], as well as Buddhist scriptures.{{sfn|Hayes|2001|p=187-212}}

The ''Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha'' with commentaries by [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhavacharya]] describes the Charvakas as critical of the Vedas, materialists without morals and ethics. To Charvakas, the text states, the Vedas suffered from several faults – errors in transmission across generations, untruth, self-contradiction and [[tautology (grammar)|tautology]]. The Charvakas pointed out the disagreements, debates and mutual rejection by ''karmakanda'' Vedic priests and ''jñānakanda'' Vedic priests, as proof that either one of them is wrong or both are wrong, as both cannot be right.{{sfn|Hayes|2001|p=187-212}}{{sfn|Madhavacharya|n.d.|pp=3-7}}{{sfn|Acharya|1894|pp=5-9}}

Charvakas, according to ''Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha'' verses 10 and 11, declared the Vedas to be incoherent rhapsodies whose only usefulness was to provide livelihood to priests. They also held the belief that Vedas were invented by man, and had no divine authority.{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=10}}

Charvakas rejected the need for ethics or morals, and suggested that "while life remains, let a man live happily, let him feed on [[ghee]] even though he runs in debt".{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=10}}

The Jain scholar Haribhadra, in the last section of his text ''Saddarsanasamuccaya'', includes Charvaka in his list of six ''[[darśana]]s'' of Indian traditions, along with Buddhism, Nyaya-Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Jainism and Jaiminiya.{{sfn|Potter|2003|pp=435–436|ps=:See verses 78-end (ET99-end)}} Haribhadra notes that Charvakas assert that there is nothing beyond the senses, consciousness is an emergent property, and that it is foolish to seek what cannot be seen.{{sfn|Potter|2003|pp=435}}

The accuracy of these views, attributed to Charvakas, has been contested by scholars.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=10, 29–32}}{{sfn|Riepe|1964|p=}}

==Works==
No independent works on Charvaka philosophy can be found except for a few [[sūtra]]s composed by Brihaspati. The 8th century ''Tattvopaplavasimha'' of [[Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa]] with [[Madhyamaka]] influence is a significant source of Charvaka philosophy. Shatdarshan Samuchay and [[Vidyaranya#Sarvadar.C5.9Banasa.E1.B9.85.CC.87graha|Sarvadarśanasaṅ̇graha]] of [[Vidyaranya]] are a few other works which elucidate Charvaka thought.{{sfn|Joshi|2005|p=37}}

In the epic [[Mahabharata]], Book 12 Chapter 39, a villain who dresses up like a scholar, appoints himself as spokesperson for all scholars, and who then advises [[Yudhishthira]] to act unethically, is named ''Charvaka''.{{sfn|Roy|1894|pp=121-122}}

One of the widely studied references to the Charvaka philosophy is the ''[[Vidyaranya#Sarvadar.C5.9Banasa.E1.B9.85.CC.87graha|Sarva-darśana-saṅgraha]]'' (etymologically all-philosophy-collection), a famous work of 14th century [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosopher [[Vidyaranya|Mādhava Vidyāraṇya]] from [[South India]], which starts with a chapter on the Charvaka system. After invoking, in the Prologue of the book, the Hindu gods [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]] ("by whom the earth and rest were produced"), Vidyāraṇya asks, in the first chapter:{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=2}}
{{Cquote|...but how can we attribute to the Divine Being the giving of supreme felicity, when such a notion has been utterly abolished by Charvaka, the crest-gem of the atheistic school, the follower of the doctrine of Brihaspati? The efforts of Charvaka are indeed hard to be eradicated, for the majority of living beings hold by the current refrain:
::While life is yours, live joyously;&lt;br/&gt;None can escape Death's searching eye:&lt;br/&gt;When once this frame of ours they burn,&lt;br/&gt;How shall it e'er again return?{{sfn|Acharya|1894|p=2}} }}

Sanskrit poems and plays like the Naiṣadha-carita, Prabodha-candrodaya, [[agamadambara|Āgama-dambara]], Vidvanmoda-taraṅgiṇī and [[Kadambari|Kādambarī]] contain representations of the Charvaka thought. However, the authors of these works were thoroughly opposed to materialism and tried to portray the Charvaka in unfavourable light. Therefore, their works should only be accepted critically.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}}

===Loss of original works===
{{Main|Barhaspatya sutras}}
There was no continuity in the Charvaka tradition after the 12th century. Whatever is written on Charvaka post this is based on second-hand knowledge, learned from preceptors to disciples and no independent works on Charvaka philosophy can be found.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}} Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Charvaka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of its ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Though materialism in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organised school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess. But almost every work of the other schools states, for refutation, the materialistic views. Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these."{{sfn|Chatterjee|Datta|2004|p=55}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Controversy on reliability of sources===
{{harvnb|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=10, 29–32}} states that the claims against Charvaka of [[hedonism]], lack of any morality and ethics and disregard for spirituality is from texts of competing religious philosophies (Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism). Its primary sources, along with commentaries by Charvaka scholars is missing or lost. This reliance on indirect sources raises the question of reliability and whether there was a bias and exaggeration in representing the views of Charvakas. Bhattacharya points out that multiple manuscripts are inconsistent, with key passages alleging hedonism and immorality missing in many manuscripts of the same text.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=10, 29–32}}

The ''Skhalitapramathana Yuktihetusiddhi'' by Āryadevapāda, in a manuscript found in Tibet, discusses the Charvaka philosophy, but attributes a theistic claim to Charvakas - that happiness in this life, and the only life, can be attained by worshiping gods and defeating demons. Toso posits that as Charvaka philosophy's views spread and were widely discussed, non-Charvakas such as Āryadevapāda added certain points of view that may not be of the Charvakas'.{{sfn|Del Toso|2010|pp=543-552}}

Buddhists, [[Jain philosophy|Jains]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedantins]] and [[Nyāya]] philosophers considered the Charvakas as one of their opponents and tried to refute their views. These refutations are indirect sources of Charvaka philosophy. The arguments and reasoning approach Charvakas deployed were significant that they continued to be referred to, even after all the authentic Charvaka/Lokāyata texts had been lost. However, the representation of the Charvaka thought in these works is not always firmly grounded in first-hand knowledge of Charvaka texts and should be viewed critically.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011a}}

Likewise, states Bhattacharya, the charge of [[hedonism]] against Charvaka might have been exaggerated.{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2011|pp=10, 29–32}} Countering the argument that the Charvakas opposed all that was good in the Vedic tradition, {{harvnb|Riepe|1964|p=75}} states, "It may be said from the available material that Cārvākas hold truth, integrity, consistency, and freedom of thought in the highest esteem."

==Criticism from Abrahamic philosophers==
[[Ain-i-Akbari]], a record of the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]]'s court, mentions a symposium of philosophers of all faiths held in 1578 at Akbar's insistence{{sfn|Mubarak|1894|pp=217-218}}(also see {{harvnb|Sen|2005|pp=288–289}}). In the text, the Mughal historian [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] summarizes the Charvaka philosophy as "unenlightened" and characterizes their works of literature as "lasting memorials to their ignorance". He notes that Charvakas considered paradise as "the state in which man lives as he chooses, without control of another", while hell as "the state in which he lives subject to another's rule". On state craft, Charvakas believe, states Mubarak, that it is best when "knowledge of just administration and benevolent government" is practiced.{{sfn|Mubarak|1894|pp=217-218}}

In [[evolutionary psychology]], the '''Cinderella effect''' is the phenomenon of higher incidence of different forms of child-abuse and mistreatment by [[Stepfamily|stepparents]] than by biological parents. It takes its name from the [[fairy tale]] character [[Cinderella]]. Evolutionary psychologists describe the effect as a byproduct of a bias towards kin, and a conflict between reproductive partners of investing in young that are unrelated to one partner. There is both supporting evidence for this theory and criticism against it.

==Background==
In the early 1970s, a theory arose on the connection between stepparents and [[child maltreatment]].  "In 1973, forensic psychiatrist P. D. Scott summarized information on a sample of "fatal battered-baby cases" perpetrated in anger ... 15 of the 29 killers – 52% – were stepfathers."&lt;ref name=TAC33&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially there was no analysis of this raw data, empirical evidence has since been collected on what is now called the Cinderella effect through official records, reports, and census.

For over 30 years, data has been collected regarding the validity of the Cinderella effect, with a wealth of evidence indicating a direct relationship between step-relationships and abuse. This evidence of [[child abuse]] and [[homicide]] comes from a variety of sources including official reports of child abuse, clinical data, victim reports, and official homicide data.&lt;ref name=DalyWilson2007&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (2007) [http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Cinderella_Effect.pdf Is the "Cinderella Effect" controversial?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516102016/http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Cinderella_Effect.pdf |date=May 16, 2011 }} In Crawford &amp; Krebs (Eds) Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, pp. 383-400. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have concluded that "stepchildren in [[Canada]], [[Great Britain]], and the [[United States]] indeed incur greatly elevated risk of child maltreatment of various sorts, especially lethal beatings".&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daly|first=M.|author2=M. Wilson|title=An assessment of some proposed exceptions to the phenomenon of nepotistic discrimination against stepchildren|journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici|year=2001|volume=38|pages=287–296|url=ftp://psyftp.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Papers/ZoologicaFennica/daly.pdf}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powerful evidence in support of the Cinderella effect comes from the finding that when abusive parents have both step and genetic children, they generally spare their genetic children. In such families, stepchildren were exclusively targeted 9 out of 10 times in one study and in 19 of 22 in another.&lt;ref name="Crawford2008p387"&gt;Crawford (2008), p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to displaying higher rates of negative behaviors (e.g., abuse) toward stepchildren, stepparents display fewer positive behaviors toward stepchildren than do the genetic parents. For example, on average, stepparents invest less in education, play with stepchildren less, take stepchildren to the doctor less, etc.&lt;ref name="Crawford2008p388"&gt;Crawford (2008), p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; This discrimination against stepchildren is unusual compared with abuse statistics involving the overall population given "the following additional facts: (1) when child abuse is detected, it is often found that ''all'' the children in the home have been victimized; and (2) stepchildren are almost always the eldest children in the home, whereas the general ... tendency in families of uniform parentage is for the youngest to be most frequent victims."&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2001" /&gt;

==Evolutionary psychology theory==
{{See also|Infanticide (zoology)|Kin selection}}

[[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] [[Martin Daly]] and [[Margo Wilson]] propose that the Cinderella effect is a direct consequence of the [[Evolution|modern evolutionary]] theory of [[inclusive fitness]], especially [[Parental investment|parental investment theory]]. They argue that human child rearing is so prolonged and costly that "a parental psychology shaped by natural selection is unlikely to be indiscriminate".&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daly | first1 = M. | last2 = Wilson | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1016/0162-3095(85)90012-3 | title = Child abuse and other risks of not living with both parents | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 197–210 | year = 1985 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, "research concerning animal social behaviour provide a rationale for expecting parents to be discriminative in their care and affection, and more specifically, to discriminate in favour of their own young".&lt;ref name=TAC8&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusive fitness theory proposes a selective criterion for the evolution of social traits, where social behavior that is costly to an individual organism can nevertheless emerge when there is a statistical likelihood that significant benefits of that social behavior accrue to (the survival and reproduction of) other organisms whom also carry the social trait (most straightforwardly, accrue to close genetic relatives). Under such conditions, a net overall increase in reproduction of the social trait in future generations can result.

The initial presentation of inclusive fitness theory (in the mid 1960s) focused on making the mathematical case for the possibility of social evolution, but also speculated about possible mechanisms whereby a social trait could effectively achieve this necessary statistical correlation between its likely bearers. Two possibilities were considered: One that a social trait might reliably operate straightforwardly via social context in species where genetic relatives are usually concentrated in a local home area where they were born ('viscous populations'); The other, that genetic detection mechanisms ('supergenes') might emerge that go beyond statistical correlations, and reliably detect ''actual'' genetic relatedness between the social actors using direct 'kin recognition'. The relative place of these two broad types of social mechanisms has been debated (see [[Kin selection]] and [[Kin recognition]]), but many biologists consider 'kin recognition' to be an important possible mechanism. Martin Daly and Margo Wilson follow this second mechanism, and expect that parents "discriminate in favour of their own young", i.e. their ''actual'' genetic relatives.

===Daly and Wilson research===
The most abundant data on stepchild mistreatment has been collected and interpreted by psychologists Martin Daly and Margo Wilson, who study with an emphasis in Neuroscience and Behavior at [[McMaster University]].  Their first measure of the validity of the Cinderella effect was based on data from the [[American Humane Association]] (AHA), an archive of child abuse reports in the United States holding over twenty thousand reports.&lt;ref name=TAC26&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; These records led Wilson and Daly to conclude that "a child under three years of age who lived with one genetic parent and one stepparent in the United States in 1976 was about seven times more likely to become a validated child-abuse case in the records than one who dwelt with two genetic parents".&lt;ref name="TAC27"&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Their overall findings demonstrate that children residing with stepparents have a higher risk of abuse even when other factors are considered.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;

====Explanation====
All organisms face [[trade-off]]s as to how to invest their time, energy, risk, and other resources, so investment in one domain (e.g., [[parental investment]]) generally takes away from their ability to invest in other domains (e.g. [[mating|mating effort]], growth, or investment in other offspring).&lt;ref name="Trivers1971"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Trivers | first1 = R. L. | doi = 10.1086/406755 | title = The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 46 | pages = 35–57 | year = 1971 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment in non-genetic children therefore reduces an individual's ability to invest in itself or its genetic children, without directly bringing reproductive benefits. Thus, from an [[evolutionary biology]] perspective, one would not expect organisms to regularly and deliberately care for unrelated offspring.

Daly and Wilson point out that [[infanticide]] is an extreme form of biasing parental investment that is widely practiced in the animal world.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1980"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daly | first1 = Martin  | last2 = Wilson | first2 = Margo  | year = 1980  | title = Discriminative Parental Solicitude: A Biological Perspective  | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family  | volume = 42  | issue = 2  | pages = 277–288  | publisher = National Council on Family Relations  | jstor = 351225  | doi = 10.2307/351225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when an immigrant male [[lion]] enters a pride, it is not uncommon for him to kill the cubs fathered by other males.&lt;ref name="Bertram1975"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bertram | first1 = B. C. R. | title = Social factors influencing reproduction in wild lions | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1975.tb02246.x | journal = Journal of Zoology | volume = 177 | issue = 4 | pages = 463–482 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the pride can only provide support for a limited number of cubs to survive to adulthood, the killing of the cubs in [[competition (biology)|competition]] with the new male's potential offspring increases the chances of his progeny surviving to maturity.&lt;ref name="Bertram1975" /&gt; In addition, the act of infanticide speeds the return to [[Estrous cycle#Estrus|sexual receptivity]] in the females, allowing for the male to father his own offspring in a timelier manner.&lt;ref name="PackerPusey1983"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Packer | first1 = C. | last2 = Pusey | first2 = A. E. | doi = 10.1086/284097 | title = Adaptations of Female Lions to Infanticide by Incoming Males | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 121 | issue = 5 | pages = 716 | year = 1983 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations indicate that in the animal world, males employ certain measures in order to ensure that parental investment is geared specifically toward their own offspring.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1980" /&gt;

Unlike the lion, however, humans in a stepparenting situation face a more complicated tradeoff since they cannot completely disown their partner's offspring from a previous relationship, as they would risk losing sexual access to their partner and any chance of producing potential offspring. Thus, according to Daly and Wilson, stepparental investment can be viewed as mating effort to ensure the possibility of future reproduction with the parent of their stepchild.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1996a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daly | first1 = M. | last2 = Wilson | first2 = M. I. | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.ep10772793 | title = Violence Against Stepchildren | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 77–81 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mating effort hypothesis suggests that humans will tend to invest more in their genetic offspring and invest just enough in their stepchildren. It is from this theoretical framework that Daly and Wilson argue that instances of child abuse towards non-biological offspring should be more frequent than towards biological offspring.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1996a" /&gt;

One would therefore expect greater parental responsiveness towards one's own offspring than towards unrelated children, and this will result in more positive outcomes and fewer negative outcomes towards one's own children than towards other children in which one is expected to invest (i.e., stepchildren). "If child abuse is a behavioral response influenced by natural selection, then it is more likely to occur when there are reduced [[inclusive fitness]] payoffs owing to uncertain or low relatedness".&lt;ref name="Burgess1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Burgess | first1 = R.

A. | doi = 10.1007/s12110-999-1008-7 | title = Beyond the "Cinderella effect" | journal = Human Nature | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 373–398 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to these adaptations from natural selection, child abuse is more likely to be committed by stepparents than genetic parents—both are expected to invest heavily in the children, but genetic parents will have greater child-specific parental love that promotes positive caretaking and inhibits maltreatment.

Daly and Wilson report that this parental love can explain why genetic offspring are more immune to lashing out by parents.&lt;ref name="DWHomP.83"&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1988), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that, "Child-specific parental love is the emotional mechanism that permits people to tolerate—even to rejoice in—those long years of expensive, unreciprocated parental investment".&lt;ref name="DWHomP.83" /&gt; They point to a study comparing natural father and stepfather families as support for the notion that stepparents do not view their stepchildren the same as their biological children, and likewise, children do not view their stepparents the same as their biological parents.&lt;ref name="DWBussP.22"&gt;Buss (1996), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perkins1979"&gt;{{Cite journal

Daly and Wilson's reports on the overrepresentation of stepparents in [[child murder|child homicide]] and abuse statistics support the evolutionary principle of maximizing one's inclusive fitness, formalized under [[Kin selection#Hamilton's rule|Hamilton's Rule]], which helps to explain why humans will preferentially invest in close kin.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1988a"&gt;{{Cite journal

====Methods====
In their 1985 Canadian sample, Daly and Wilson classify the frequencies of different living arrangements (two natural parents, one natural parent, one natural parent with one stepparent, or other) according to child age. This was accomplished by administering a randomized telephone survey.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;

Records of child abuse from children's aid organizations as well as police reports on runaways and juvenile offenders were then used to determine whether children from stepparental living situations were overrepresented as abuse victims when compared to the demographic data gathered from the telephone survey data. The results indicate that the only living situation that has a significant correlation to increased child abuse is one natural parent and one stepparent in the same household. While rates of running away and crime were comparable for children living with stepparents and children of single-parents, abuse rates for children living with stepparents were much higher.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;

Daly and Wilson examined several potentially [[confounding| confounding variables]] in their research, including [[socioeconomic status]], family size, and maternal age at childbirth, however only minor differences between natural-parent and stepparent families with respect to these factors were found, indicating that none of these are major contributing factors to the observed Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson1985" /&gt;

===Attachment theory===
{{further|Attachment theory}}

Evolutionary psychologists have also suggested that one of the causes of stepchild abuse may be the lack of a parental [[attachment theory|attachment bond]] that the mother would normally form with her own child {{Citation needed |date=February 2016}}. An attachment bond will, in general, be more secure if formed before the age of two, and adoption can often disrupt the development of this bond. An infant who is fed by the primary parental figure, usually the mother, and has the mother present during severely physically painful events will have form a stronger parental attachment bond, and either a consistent omission of the mother from this process or an alteration between two people (the original mother and the adoptive mother) can cause either an insecure attachment or disorganized attachment from the parent to the child {{Citation needed |date=February 2016}}. As a result, it is highly recommended by most psychologists that the adoptive mother be present very early in the infant's life, preferably immediately after its birth, in order to avoid attachment disruptions and attachment disorders.&lt;ref name=Cooper1998&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory cannot be a whole explanation for the Cinderella effect, as psychological research has shown that secure attachment bonds can be developed between a parent and adopted child, and the quality of the relationship between parent and child will more often depend on the child's pre-adoption experiences, such as length of time in social care and previous trauma, more than characteristics of the parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Londen |first1=W.

===Misunderstandings===
It is sometimes argued that this evolutionary psychological account does not explain why the majority of stepparents do not abuse their partners' children, or why a significant minority of genetic parents do abuse their own offspring. However, their argument is based on a misunderstanding: the evolutionary psychological account is that (all else equal) parents will love their own children more than other people's children – it does not argue that stepparents will "want" to abuse their partner's children, or that genetic parenthood is absolute proof against abuse. Under this account, stepparental care is seen as "mating effort" towards the genetic parent, such that most interactions between stepparent and stepchildren will be generally positive or at least neutral, just usually not as positive as interactions between the genetic parent and the child would be.&lt;ref name=TAC&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong support for the Cinderella effect as described by Daly and Wilson comes from a study of unintentional childhood fatal injuries in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="Tooley2006"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Tooley | first1 = G.| last2 = Karakis | first2 = M.| last3 = Stokes | first3 = M.| last4 = Ozannesmith | first4 = J.| title = Generalising the Cinderella Effect to unintentional childhood fatalities| journal = Evolution and Human Behavior| volume = 27| pages = 224–230| year = 2006| doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tooley et al. follow the argument of Daly and Wilson to extend the Cinderella effect from cases of abuse to incidences of unintentional fatalities. Children are not only vulnerable to abuse by their parents, but they are also dependent on their parents for supervision and protection from a variety of other harms.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wadsworth1983"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wadsworth | first1 = J. | last2 = Burnell | first2 = I. | last3 = Taylor | first3 = B. | last4 = Butler | first4 = N. | title = Family type and accidents in preschool children | doi = 10.1136/jech.37.2.100 | journal = Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 100–104 | year = 1983 | pmid =  | pmc = 1052270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that parental supervision is fundamentally correlated to incidences of unintentional childhood injury as shown by Wadsworth et al. and Peterson &amp; Stern, Tooley et al. posit that selective pressures would favor an inclination towards parental vigilance against threats to offspring well-being.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wadsworth1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson1997"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tooley et al. further argue that parental vigilance is not as highly engaged in stepparents as genetic parents, therefore placing stepchildren at greater risk for unintentional injury.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt;

Based on data gathered from the Australia National Coroners' Information System, stepchildren under five years of age are two to fifteen times more likely to experience an unintentional fatal injury, especially drowning, than genetic children.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; Additionally, the study finds that the risks of unintentional fatal injury are not significantly higher for genetic children in single parent homes versus two-parent homes.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; This difference suggests that removing one biological parent from the home does not significantly increase risk to the children, but that adding a nonbiological parent to the home results in a drastic increase in the risk of unintentional fatal injury.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; Despite the fact that adding a stepparent to the home increases the available resources in terms of supervision in comparison to a single-parent home, risk of unintentional fatal injury still significantly rises.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; This higher risk of injury for stepchildren can be attributed to the fact that stepparents occupy the same supervisory role as a genetic parent, yet they have a lower intrinsic commitment to protecting the child and therefore are less likely to be adequately vigilant.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; The authors conclude that the Cinderella effect applies not only to purposeful abuse by stepparents, but is also relevant to explaining increased rates of accidental fatalities among stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt;

Furthermore, a study of parental investment behaviors among American men living in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]], reveals a trend of increasing financial expenditures on genetic offspring in comparison to step-offspring, which also suggests that parents are less inclined to preserve the well-being of stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = K.

Though the general trend of the data from this study supports the Cinderella effect, Anderson and colleagues note that the observed differences between investment in children and stepchildren might be slightly reduced by a few confounding factors.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999a" /&gt; For example, the authors point out that stepparenting is a [[self-selection bias|self-selective]] process, and that when all else is equal, men who bond with unrelated children are more likely to become stepfathers, a factor that is likely to be a confounding variable in efforts to study the Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999a" /&gt; Anderson and colleagues also conducted a similar study of [[xhosa people|Xhosa]] students in [[South Africa]] that analyzes the same four classifications of adult-child relationships, and this study offers similar results to those observed among men in Albuquerque.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999b"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = K.

Additionally, a study of [[Hadza people|Hadza]] foragers in [[Tanzania]] by Marlowe also finds evidence of decreased care provided by men to stepchildren when compared with genetic children.&lt;ref name="Marlowe1999"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Marlowe | first1 = F. | doi = 10.1007/s002650050592 | title = Male care and mating effort among Hadza foragers | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 46 | pages = 57–64 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author uses the [[Mann-Whitney U| Mann-Whitney U-tests]] to evaluate most of the observed differences in care exhibited towards children and stepchildren, and finds that Hadza men spend less time with (U=96), communicate less with (U=94.5), nurture less, and never play with their stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Marlowe1999" /&gt; Marlowe further argues that any care that is provided towards stepchildren is likely attributable to the man's mating efforts and not parental interest in the well-being of the stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Marlowe1999" /&gt;

In further support of the Cinderella effect as elaborated by Daly and Wilson, a study conducted in a rural village in [[Trinidad]] demonstrates that in households containing both genetic children and stepchildren, fathers devote approximately twice as much time to interaction with genetic offspring in comparison to stepchildren.&lt;ref name="Flinn1988"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flinn | first1 = M.

This includes, for example, spanking, screaming, crying, and arguing. The duration of the relationship between genetic fathers and children shows a positive correlation with both relative proportion of interaction time and antagonistic interaction.&lt;ref name="Flinn1988" /&gt; The author argues that these results show that in terms of time invested, men favor their children over stepchildren, and this preference is not attributable to the duration of the adult-child relationship, a factor which is sometimes believed to be a confounding variable in the Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="Flinn1988" /&gt; Though this study does claim a significant increase in antagonistic behavior between stepparents and stepchildren and therefore supports the Cinderella effect, it also notes that only six percent of all the observed parent-child interactions were considered antagonistic, and that the researchers never noticed any blatant physical child abuse.&lt;ref name="Flinn1988" /&gt;

==Criticism==

=== David Buller ===
[[Philosopher of science]] David Buller, as a part of his general critique of evolutionary psychology &lt;ref name="Holcomb2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holcomb|first=H. R.|title=Book Review: Buller does to Evolutionary Psychology what Kitcher did to Sociobiology|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|year=2005|volume=3|pages=392–401|url=http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep03392401.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has reviewed Daly and Wilson's data. He argues that evolutionary psychology (EP) mistakenly attempts to discover human [[psychological adaptation]]s rather than "the evolutionary causes of psychological traits." Buller also argues that Daly and Wilson's 1985 Canadian sample included cases of sexual abuse as well as cases of unintentional omission, such as not buckling a child's seatbelt in the car. Buller asserts that unintentional omission does not fall under the realm of dangerous acts, and rather should be designated "maltreatment". He argues that since sexual abuse is not often accompanied by physical abuse, it is unreasonable to assume that it is motivated by the same kind of psychological mechanism as child homicide. Buller also points out that the conclusion that non-biological parents are more likely to abuse children is contradicted by the fact that even if the rate of abuse among stepparents was disproportionate, most child abuse is in fact committed by biological parents, and that the lowest rate of child abuse is found among adoptive parents.&lt;ref name="Buller2005a"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buller | first1 = D.

Buller also argues that Daly and Wilson's findings are inherently biased since they use data from official documents, and the officials collecting that data are trained to take special notice of stepparents versus biological parents.&lt;ref name="Buller2005b"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buller | first1 = D.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this study, by Crume et al., when the perpetrator of the murder was a parent, maltreatment was correctly noted on the death certificate only 46 percent of the time. Furthermore, they found that when the perpetrator was an "Other unrelated (including boyfriend)" individual, maltreatment was reported on the death certificate 86 percent of the time, significantly higher than for parents.&lt;ref name="Crume2002" /&gt; Although these statistics seem to provide evidence of bias against stepparents, further review of the data undermines this conclusion. As Crume et al. and Daly and Wilson note, maltreatment was only likely to be reported on the death certificates 47 percent of the time in the case of "Other relatives (including step-parents)," which represents a marginal increase from the amount of parental maltreatment.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2005"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Temrin et al. Sweden study ===
The findings of Daly and Wilson have been called into question by one study of child homicides in [[Sweden]] between 1975 and 1995, which found that children living in households with a non-genetic parent were not at an increased risk of homicide when compared to children living with both genetic parents. The study, published in 2000 and conducted by Temrin and colleagues argued that when Daly and Wilson classified homicides according to family situation, they did not account for the genetic relatedness of the parent who actually committed the crime. In the Swedish sample, in two out of the seven homicides with a genetic and non-genetic parent, the offender was actually the genetic parent and thus these homicides do not support Daly and Wilson's definition of the Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="Temrin2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Temrin | first1 = H. | last2 = Buchmayer | first2 = S. | last3 = Enquist | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2000.1094 | title = Step-parents and infanticide: New data contradict evolutionary predictions | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 267 | issue = 1446 | pages = 943–945 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10853739| pmc = 1690621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daly and Wilson attribute the contrasting findings of the Swedish study to an analytical oversight. Temrin and colleagues neglect to consider the fact that the proportion of children in living situations with a stepparent is not constant for all child age groups, but rather increases with age. After correcting for age differences, the Swedish data set produces results in accordance with the previous findings of Daly and Wilson. The Swedish sample does show, however, decreased risk to children living with a stepparent compared to the North American samples collected by Daly and Wilson, suggesting that there is some degree of cross-cultural variation in the Cinderella effect.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2001" /&gt;

===Alternative hypotheses===
It has been noted by multiple researchers that child abuse is an intricate issue and is affected by other factors.&lt;ref name="Burgess1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Temrin2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Giles-Sims1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giles-Sims | first1 = Jean  | last2 = Finkelhor | first2 = David  | year = 1984  | title = Child Abuse in Stepfamilies  | journal = Family Relations  | volume = 33  | issue = 3  | pages = 407–413  | publisher = National Council on Family Relations  | jstor = 584711  | doi = 10.2307/584711 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daly and Wilson state, however, that even if evolutionary psychology cannot account for every instance of stepparental abuse, this does not invalidate their empirical findings.&lt;ref name="DalyWilson2005" /&gt;

Burgess and Drais propose that child maltreatment is too complex to be explained fully by genetic relatedness alone and cite other reasons for child maltreatment, such as social factors, ecological factors and child traits such as disability and age.&lt;ref name="Burgess1999" /&gt; However, they also note that these traits are simply indicative, and do not inevitably lead to child maltreatment.&lt;ref name="Burgess1999" /&gt; Temrin and colleagues also suggest that there may be other factors involved with child homicide, such as prior convictions, drug abuse problems, lost custody battles and mental health problems.&lt;ref name="Temrin2000" /&gt;

In 1984, Giles-Sims and [[David Finkelhor]] categorized and evaluated five possible hypotheses that could explain the Cinderella effect: "social-evolutionary theory", "normative theory", "stress theory", "selection factors", and "resource theory". The social-evolutionary theory is based on the proposal that non-genetically related parents will invest less in costly parental duties, due to the fact that their genes are not being passed on by that individual. The normative theory proposes that, due to genetic repercussions, incest among genetically related individuals is a widespread taboo and would thus be less common among biological relatives. They propose that incest among stepfamilies would be less taboo, since there is no risk of genetic degradation. The stress theory proposes that increased stressors, which are inherently more common among stepfamilies, cause an increased risk of abuse. The selection factors theory proposes that individuals who are likely to be stepparents (divorcees) are likely to be inherently more violent due to emotional disturbances, aggressive impulses, and self-esteem issues. Due to this, stepparents as a group would have a higher proportion of individuals with violent-prone characteristics, which would suggest that the abuse is happening due to personality factors, rather than the stepparental relationship directly. Finally, according to resource theory, individuals who contribute resources are granted authority, while individuals that lack resources are denied authority and more likely to resort to violence to obtain authority. It is therefore hypothesized that stepparents who are able to contribute resources to a family and have those resources be accepted by the family are less likely to be abusive. However, this hypothesis had yet to be tested directly on stepfamilies.&lt;ref name="Giles-Sims1984" /&gt; This paper of Giles-Sims and Finkelhor predates however practically all empirical studies on the Cinderella effect.

===Ethical issues===
Discussing the implications of this line of research, Australian psychologist Greg Tooley, author of a 2006 study confirming the existence of the effect,&lt;ref name="Tooley2006" /&gt; confessed that "it is certainly difficult to talk about because it is such a hot issue".&lt;ref name=Trounson2008&gt;Andrew Trounson, [http://flwg.com.au/pg/news/view/general_2/children-safer-with Children 'safer with biological parent'], ''[[The Australian]]'', May 07, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3893">'''Rebecca Riley''' (April 11, 2002 – December 13, 2006), the daughter of Michael and Carolyn Riley and resident of [[Hull, Massachusetts]], was found dead in her home after prolonged exposure to various medications, her lungs filled with fluid. The medical examiner's office determined the girl died from "intoxication due to the combined effects" of prescription drugs. Police reports state she was taking 750 milligrams a day of [[Depakote]], 200 milligrams a day of [[Seroquel]], and .35 milligrams a day of clonidine. Rebecca had been taking the drugs since the age of two for [[bipolar disorder]] and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], diagnosed by psychiatrist Kayoko Kifuji of the [[Tufts-New England Medical Center]].&lt;ref name=stuarta&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirk |first=Stuart A. |title=Mad Science: Psychiatric Coercion, Diagnosis, and Drugs |year=2013 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |page= 218-219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Riley parents were unemployed and the family relied on Social Security Benefits. From the age of two, Rebecca was diagnosed with [[ADHD]] and bipolar disorder, mainly on the basis of information given by her mother to child psychiatrist Kayoko Kifuji from the Tufts-New England Medical Center. Kifuji prescribed a range of drugs for Rebecca: [[clonidine]], [[valproate]] (Depakote), [[dextromethorphan]], and [[chlorpheniramine]] and her heart and lungs were damaged due to prolonged use of these prescription drugs.&lt;ref name=stuarta/&gt;&lt;ref name=kat&gt;Katie Couric, [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-killed-rebecca-riley/"What Killed Rebecca Riley?"], ''[[CBS News]]'', 28 Sep 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In 2006, Rebecca was found on the floor of her bedroom, dead from a drug overdose. Immediately after her death, her medication regime was defended by Tufts-New England Medical Center.&lt;ref name=stuarta/&gt;&lt;ref name=kat/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Michael and Carolyn Riley were taken into police custody on February 6, 2007 for Rebecca’s death and charged with first degree murder. Their two other children, who were also on a number of prescription medications, have been moved to foster homes and the [[Department of Social Services]] reports the parents have a history of being abusive and neglectful. On February 9, 2010, Carolyn Riley was found guilty of second degree murder in the death of her daughter and was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in 15 years. Michael's trial began on March 8, 2010. On September 27, 2010, Michael Riley was found guilty of first degree murder and received the automatic sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.&lt;ref name=stuarta/&gt;

As of 2013, Kayoko Kifuji continues to practice as a child psychiatrist.&lt;ref name=stuarta/&gt;&lt;ref name=psychcon&gt;Patricia Wen, [http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/02/11/jurors_outraged_by_psychiatrists_conduct/ Jurors outraged by psychiatrist’s conduct: Felt she should share culpability in toddler’s death], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14795">'''Dragon kill points''' or '''DKP''' are a semi-formal score-keeping system ([[loot system]]) used by [[Clan (computer gaming)#Clans in RPGs|guilds]] in [[massively multiplayer online game]]s.  Players in these games are faced with large scale challenges, or [[Raid (gaming)|raids]], which may only be surmounted through the concerted effort of dozens of players at a time.  While many players may be involved in defeating a [[Boss (video game)|boss]], the boss will reward the group with only a small number of items desired by the players.  Faced with this scarcity, some system of fairly distributing the items must be established.  Used originally in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game ''[[EverQuest]]'', dragon kill points are points that are awarded to players for defeating bosses and redeemed for items that those bosses would 'drop'.  At the time most of the bosses faced by the players were dragons, hence the name.

While not transferable outside of a particular guild, DKP are often treated in a manner similar to currency by guilds.  They are paid out at a specified rate and redeemed in modified [[First-price sealed-bid auction|first]] or [[Vickrey auction|second price auctions]], although these are not the only methods by which DKP may be redeemed or awarded.  However, Dragon kill points are distinct from the virtual currencies in each game world which are designed by the game developers—DKP systems vary from guild to guild and the points themselves only have value in regard to the dispersal of boss 'loot'.

==Origin and motivation==

DKP systems were first designed for ''Everquest'' in 1999 by [[Thottbot|Thott]] as part of the creation of a guild called "Afterlife" and named for two dragons, Lady Vox and Lord Nagafen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=M.|title=Beyond fun in games: The serious leisure of the power gamer|publisher=[[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]]|year=2006|page=91}} Quoted in Malone, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterlifeguild.org/dkp-explanation|title=DKP explanation|work=Guild Afterlife |accessdate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guild leadership"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rezvani|first=Jeon|title=Guild Leadership|year=2008|pages=107, 108|isbn=978-1-4357-3955-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has been adapted for use in other similar online games, in World of Warcraft for example an Avatar named Dragonkiller started its popular use and other programmers designed applications so that the system could work in game as an application to track data for achievements made. Unlike [[role-playing game|pen and paper]] or more traditional [[role-playing video game]]s, massively multiplayer online games could present challenges so significant that the number of players required to defeat them would greatly exceed the number of items awarded to the raid following the boss kill—a raid of 25 individuals may only see two or three items 'drop'.  The actual number of players required to defeat a specific boss varies from game to game, but the [[person-hour]]s invested are non-trivial.  Raid encounters may involve "10-200 players organized to achieve a common goal over a period of typically around 3-6 continuous hours" and demand teamwork and competence from all raid members.&lt;ref name="Daedelus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/000859.php|title=Dragon Slaying 101: Understanding The Complexity of Raids|last=Yee|first=Nick|authorlink=Nick Yee|work=The Daedalus Project|accessdate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the number of players required to defeat a boss grows, so does the problem of distributing the rewards from such efforts.  Since these items appear, or "drop", in quantities much smaller than the total number of players in the group required to defeat them, a means of deciding which of the players should receive the items is necessary.  At the "[[EverQuest#Social dynamics|endgame]]", new items rewarded from boss kills represent one of the only means to continue to enhance the combat effectiveness of the character or the [[Social interaction in MMORPGs|social standing of the player]].  As such, individual players care about receiving a fair shot at dropped items.&lt;ref&gt;Castronova &amp; Fairfield 2006, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;  Guilds facing smaller challenges with fewer players typically begin by allotting items through a [[Pseudorandom number generator|simulated roll]] of the dice (provided by the software serving the game itself), similar to dice rolls used to dictate the outcome of contingent events in pen and paper role-playing games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine|first=Gary Alan|authorlink=Gary Alan Fine|title=Shared Fantasy|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|date=2002-08-14|pages=92–98|isbn=0-226-24944-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the number of players expands, rolls may be weighted by seniority within the guild or adjusted by some other measure so as to ensure that veterans of the guild do not lose out on an item to a new member.&lt;ref&gt;Castronova &amp; Fairfield 2006, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Games and dungeons which require larger groups of players may create the incentive for more formal DKP systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/preview/world-of-warcraft-the-burning-crusade/a-2006081119348525039|title=World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade |last=Graziani|first=Gabe|date=August 2006|work=[[Games Radar]]|publisher=Future US|accessdate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Methods to reward items according to seniority or performance developed out of these modifications, including systems relying on a formal allotment of points per kill.&lt;ref name="Daedelus"/&gt;

==Mechanics of a DKP system==

The basic concepts of most DKP systems are simple.  Players are given points for participating in raids or other guild events and spend those points on the item of their choice when the boss 'drops' the item.  A player who does not get a chance to spend their DKP accumulates it between raids and is able to spend it in the future.  These points, while earned and spent like currency, are not the same thing as the virtual currency provided by the game company for the virtual world.  The points themselves represent only the social contract that guilds extend to players.  Should that player leave the guild or the guild disband, those points become valueless.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  These measures vary considerably in usage.  Some guilds eschew formalized 'loot' systems completely, allowing guild leaders to direct which players receive items from bosses.  Some use complex measures to determine item price while others use an auction system to allocate goods via bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060822/vgsca_gama.pdf|title=Addiction and the Structural Characteristics of Massively Multiplayer Online Games |last=Clark|first=Neils L.|date=August 22, 2006|work=[[Gamasutra]]|publisher=United Business Media|pages=19|accessdate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few common variations are described below.

===Zero-sum DKP===

Zero-sum DKP systems are designed to ensure the net change in points among the raid is zero for each item dropped, as the name might suggest.  When the item drops, each player who is interested in it indicates as much to a guild leader.  The player who has the highest DKP total receives the item for its specified price and the same number of points are divided evenly among the rest of the raid and given out, resulting in no net change to the raid total.  As a result, the raid would only be rewarded DKP if at least one player desired the item dropped by the boss.  Since over time guilds will revisit the same boss multiple times, some zero-sum DKP systems are modified to introduce a "dummy" character which may be awarded DKP for the boss 'kill' even though no player in the guild received an item.  This is purely an accounting measure and allows the guild to reward players for defeating a boss if they are using an automated point tracking system.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Whitehead and Whitehead, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malone, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple DKP===

The simplest DKP variation is one where every item has a set price list and each player earns some specified number of DKP each time they participate in a guild raid.&lt;ref name="Mortensen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mortensen|first=Torill Elvira|year=2006|title=WoW is the New MUD|journal=[[Games and Culture]]|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |volume=1|issue=4|pages=397–413|doi=10.1177/1555412006292622}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like zero-sum systems, the player with the most points recorded actually received the item, paying the specified price.  Unlike zero-sum, a simple DKP system does not compensate the rest of the raid based in the value of the items received.

===Auction systems===

Setting "prices" in DKP for specific items can be difficult, as analysis of a particular item can be subjective and laborious.&lt;ref&gt;Castronova &amp; Fairfield 2006, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to avoid this quandary, guilds may establish an auction system for items.  Points are awarded to the player at some specified rate and when the items are awarded to the raid group, players bid DKP for the item of their choice.  Auctions may be conducted in an open ascending fashion or through sealed bids over private messages to guild leaders.  While this process results in relatively efficient allocation of items to players willing to part with DKP, it presents the social consequence that perceived selfish bidding could result in an item being awarded to a character who would not make the best use of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Mark|date=December 11, 2008|title=Communication, Coordination, and Camaraderie in World of Warcraft  |journal=Games and Culture|volume=4|issue=1|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|pages=28, 29|issn=1555-4120|doi=10.1177/1555412008325478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GDKP (Gold DKP)===

Gold DKP (GDKP) is a system developed for pick up groups (PUG).  This system was introduced to support individuals without a guild to support raids for difficult bosses/zones.  In GDKP, when a boss is killed, each item dropped is put up for auction with a low value.  Each item is then auctioned.  The eventual winner pays the loot master, and after every item has been auctioned off, every participant in the group is rewarded an equal share of gold.  For example, if 20 members were in the group, and 500 gold was spent on items, each raid participant would receive 25 gold.

==DKP as virtual capital==
{{further|Virtual economy|MMORPG#Economics}}
Since the intention of DKP is to allocate scarce resources amongst guild members, they can be understood in the context of virtual capital.  Players "earn" and "spend" DKP, bidding in a system of auctions for an item which holds some value for them.  DKP are referred to as "currency" a guild leader pays his "employees".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_56/335-My-Second-Job.2|title=My Second Job|last=Butts|first=Whitney|work=The Escapist|publisher=Themis Media|accessdate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these analogies, DKP remain a kind of "private money system", allowing guilds to mete out these otherwise unachievable items in return for participation and discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Castronova &amp; Fairfield 2006, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  The points cannot be traded or redeemed outside the guild and are not actually part of the game itself; they are tracked on external websites.  In contrast, the virtual currencies created by game developers are part of the game software and may be traded between players without respect to any social affiliation.  Just as DKP is valueless outside the guild, parlaying of economic capital for DKP ([[Virtual economy|paying real world currency]] in exchange for DKP) is almost unheard of.&lt;ref&gt;Castronova &amp; Fairfield 2006, pp. 7–10&lt;/ref&gt;  Because guilds mete out DKP in return for participation in events the functional result is that DKP serve less as currency or material capital and more as what Torill Mortensen refers to as a "social stabilizer"; players who attend raids more frequently or play by the rules reap the rewards while more "casual" gamers do not.  This provides an incentive for players to remain in the social system (the guild) longer than they might otherwise.&lt;ref name="Mortensen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malone, pp. 16–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the guild, DKP may stand in for [[Competence (human resources)|competence]]—high level items (Krista-Lee Malone mentions a specific item from ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', the "Cold Snap" wand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=19130|title=Cold Snap |work=The [[World of Warcraft]] Armory|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are forms of cultural capital themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the items are "bound" to the player who first receives them, the only way to wield a desired item is to be involved in the raid that defeated the boss which rewards it.  As such, a "Cold Snap" represents a signal to other players that the bearer has defeated a particular high-level monster and therefore mastered the skills needed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/001300.php?page=6|title=In Their Own Words: The Achievement Component|last=Yee|first=Nick|work=The Daedalus Project|accessdate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The points themselves represent a mélange of cultural and material capital.  The language of material capital is used: "price", "bid", and "currency", but these terms belie a [[unit of account]] that "crosses the line between material and symbolic".&lt;ref&gt;Malone, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological activity==
As small-molecule, synthetic, DNA minor groove binding alkylating agents, duocarmycins are suitable to target solid tumors. They bind to the [[minor groove]] of DNA and [[alkylation|alkylate]] the nucleobase [[adenine]] at the N3 position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boger |first1=D. L. |year=1993 |title=Design, synthesis, and evaluation of DNA minor groove binding agents |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=65 |issue=6 |pages=1123–32 |doi=10.1351/pac199365061123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boger |first1=Dale L. |last2=Johnson |first2=Douglas S. |year=1995 |title=CC-1065 and the Duocarmycins: Unraveling the Keys to a New Class of Naturally Derived DNA Alkylating Agents |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=3642–9 |pmid=7731958 |pmc=42018 |bibcode=1995PNAS...92.3642B |doi=10.1073/pnas.92.9.3642}}&lt;/ref&gt; The irreversible alkylation of DNA disrupts the nucleic acid architecture, which eventually leads to tumor cell death. Analogues of naturally occurring antitumour agents, such as duocarmycins, represent a new class of highly potent antineoplastic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tietze |first1=Lutz F. |last2=Krewer |first2=Birgit |year=2009 |title=Antibody-Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy: A Promising Approach for a Selective Treatment of Cancer Based on Prodrugs and Monoclonal Antibodies |journal=Chemical Biology &amp; Drug Design |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=205–11 |doi=10.1111/j.1747-0285.2009.00856.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cacciari |first1=Barbara |last2=Romagnoli |first2=Romeo |last3=Baraldi |first3=Pier Giovanni |last4=Ros |first4=Tatiana Da |last5=Spalluto |first5=Giampiero |year=2000 |title=CC-1065 and the duocarmycins: Recent developments |journal=Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=1853–71 |doi=10.1517/13543776.10.12.1853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of [[Dale L. Boger]] and others created a better understanding of the [[pharmacophore]] and [[mechanism of action]] of the duocarmycins. This research has led to synthetic analogs including [[adozelesin]], [[bizelesin]], and [[carzelesin]] which progressed into clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. Similar research that Boger utilized for comparison to his results involving elimination of cancerous tumors and antigens was centered around the use of similar immunoconjugates that were introduced to cancerous colon cells. These studies related to Boger's research involving antigen-specificity that is necessary to the success of the duocarmycins as antitumor treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=C|last2=Tadayoni|first2=B M|last3=Bourret|first3=L A|last4=Mattocks|first4=K M|last5=Derr|first5=S M|last6=Widdison|first6=W C|last7=Kedersha|first7=N L|last8=Ariniello|first8=P D|last9=Goldmacher|first9=V S|date=1996-08-06|title=Eradication of large colon tumor xenografts by targeted delivery of maytansinoids.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=93|issue=16|pages=8618–8623|issn=0027-8424|pmc=38722|pmid=8710920|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.16.8618|bibcode=1996PNAS...93.8618L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duocarmycin analogues vs tubulin binders==
The duocarmycin analogues are able to exert their mode of action at any phase in the cellular cycle, whereas tubulin binders will only attack tumor cells when they are in a mitotic state. Growing evidence suggests that DNA damaging agents, such as duocarmycins, are more efficacious in tumor cell killing than tubulin binders, particularly in case of solid tumors. They have shown activity in a variety of multi-drug resistant (MDR) models. Agents that are part of this class of duocarmycins have the potency in the low picomolar range. This makes them suitable for maximizing the cell-killing potency of antibody-drug conjugates to which they are attached. Another important benefit is that, unlike other drug classes, duocarmycins can be effective against tumor cells that are multi-drug resistant. For example, potent cytotoxicity has been demonstrated in cells that express the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump. Multi-drug resistance presents a significant problem in the clinical setting and agents that are less susceptible to these mechanisms can successfully be used in prolonged treatment protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adcreview.com/uncategorized/duocarmycin-analogues-2/ |title=Duocarmycin analogues |work=ADC Review/Journal of Antibody-drug Conjugates |date=November 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141126193402/http://adcreview.com/uncategorized/duocarmycin-analogues-2/ |archivedate=November 26, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antibody-drug conjugates==
The DNA modifying agents such as duocarmycin are being used in the development of [[antibody-drug conjugate]] or ADCs. Scientists at The Netherlands-based [[Synthon (company)|Synthon]] (formerly Syntarga) have combined a unique linkers with duocarmycin derivatives that have a hydroxyl group which is crucial for biological activity. Using this technology scientists aims to create ADCs having an optimal therapeutic window, balancing the effect of potent cell-killing agents on tumor cells versus healthy cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hofland |first1=Peter |title= First-in-Human Trial With SYD985 Evaluates Safety and Efficacy in Cancer Patients |journal=ADCReview /Journal of Antibody-drug Conjugates |issue= November 2014 |url=http://adcreview.com/news/syd985-first-in-human-trial/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthetic analogs==
The synthetic analogs of duocarmycins include [[adozelesin]], [[bizelesin]], and [[carzelesin]]. As members of the cyclopropylpyrroloindole family, these investigational drugs have progressed into clinical trials for the treatment of cancer.

===Adozelesin===
[[File:Adozelesin.svg|thumbnail|Adozelesin]]
Adozelesin is an alkylating minor groove DNA binder that is capable of rapidly inhibiting DNA replication in treated cells through a trans-acting mechanism and preferentially arrests cells in S phase. It has been shown previously that in cells treated with adozelesin, replication protein A (RPA) activity is deficient, and the middle subunit of RPA is hyperphosphorylated. The adozelesin-induced RPA hyperphosphorylation can be blocked by the replicative DNA polymerase inhibitor, aphidicolin, suggesting that adozelesin-triggered cellular DNA damage responses require active DNA replication forks. These data imply that cellular DNA damage responses to adozelesin treatment are preferentially induced in S phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Jen-Sing |last2=Kuo |first2=Shu-Ru |last3=Beerman |first3=Terry A. |last4=Melendy |first4=Thomas |year=2003 |title=Induction of DNA Damage Responses by Adozelesin Is S Phase-specific and Dependent on Active Replication Forks |journal=Molecular Cancer Therapeutics |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=41–7 |pmid=12533671 |url=http://mct.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12533671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bizelesin===
[[File:bizelesin.svg|thumbnail|Bizelesin]]
Bizelesin is antineoplastic antibiotic which binds to the minor groove of DNA and induces interstrand cross-linking of DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and RNA synthesis. Bizelesin also enhances p53 and p21 induction and triggers G2/M cell-cycle arrest, resulting in cell senescence without apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medkoo.com/Anticancer-trials/Bizelesin.htm |title=Bizelesin |publisher=MedKoo Biosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adozelesin and bizelesin cause genomic DNA lesions by alkylating DNA. Adozelesin induces single-strand DNA lesions, whereas bizelesin induces both single-strand lesions and double-strand DNA cross-links. At equivalent cytotoxic concentrations, these agents caused different biological responses. Low adozelesin concentrations (e.g., 0.5 nM) induced a transient S-phase block and cell cycle arrest in G(2)-M, as well as increased induction of p53 and p21, whereas a high drug concentration (e.g., 2.5 nM) caused apoptosis but no p21 induction. In contrast, both low and high bizelesin concentrations enhanced p53 and p21 induction and triggered G(2)-M cell cycle arrest and eventual senescence without significant apoptotic cell death. However, in cells lacking p21, bizelesin, as well as adozelesin, triggered apoptosis, indicating that p21 was crucial to sustained bizelesin-induced G(2)-M arrest. Despite similar abilities to alkylate DNA, adozelesin and bizelesin caused a decrease in [[HCT116]] tumor cell proliferation by different pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cao |first1=Pei-rang |last2=McHugh |first2=Mary M. |last3=Melendy |first3=Thomas |last4=Beerman |first4=Terry |year=2003 |title=The DNA Minor Groove-alkylating Cyclopropylpyrroloindole Drugs Adozelesin and Bizelesin Induce Different DNA Damage Response Pathways in Human Colon Carcinoma HCT116 Cells |journal=Molecular Cancer Therapeutics |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=651–9 |pmid=12883038 |url=http://mct.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12883038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carzelesin ===

[[File:carzelesin.svg|thumbnail|Carzelesin]]
Carzelesin (U-80244) is a cyclopropylpyrroloindole prodrug containing a relatively nonreactive chloromethyl precursor to the cyclopropyl function. Activation of carzelesin requires two steps, (a) hydrolysis of a phenylurethane substituent to form U-76073, followed by (b) ring closure to form the cyclopropyl-containing DNA-reactive U-76074. The formation of the DNA-reactive U-76074, via U-76073, from carzelesin was shown to proceed very slowly in phosphate-buffered saline (t1/2 greater than 24 h) but to occur rapidly in plasma from mouse, rat, dog, and human (initial t1/2 values ranging from 18 min for mouse to 52 min for rat) and in cell culture medium (t1/2 approximately 40 min). Although carzelesin was less potent in terms of in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo optimal dosage and showed low affinity for binding to DNA, it was therapeutically more efficacious against mouse L1210 leukemia than was U-76074 or adozelesin (U-73975), another cyclopropylpyrroloindole analogue which is currently in phase I clinical trials. Carzelesin also proved to be more efficacious than U-76074 or adozelesin against mouse pancreatic ductal 02 adenocarcinoma, a system reported to be resistant to every agent tested. Carzelesin was highly effective against this tumor and produced 97% tumor growth inhibition. In addition, i.v. administered carzelesin showed significant activity (National Cancer Institute criteria) against i.v. or s.c. implanted Lewis lung carcinoma, i.p. or s.c. implanted B16 melanoma, s.c. implanted colon 38 carcinoma, and five s.c. implanted human tumor xenografts, including clear cell [[Caki-1]] carcinoma, colon [[CX-1]] adenocarcinoma, lung [[LX-1]] tumor, ovarian [[A2780 (cell line)|2780]] carcinoma, and prostatic [[DU-145]] carcinoma. Carzelesin treatment produced 100% complete remissions (no palpable tumor mass at the termination of the experiment) in mice bearing early-stage human ovarian 2780. Pharmacologically, carzelesin proved to be relatively schedule and route independent and was highly active against i.p. implanted [[L1210]] leukemia, regardless of whether the analogue was given i.v., i.p., s.c., or p.o. These results, collectively, suggest that carzelesin is absorbed and distributed well. Both carzelesin and adozelesin caused marked tumor shrinkage in mice bearing human lung LX-1 or advanced-stage human ovarian 2780 carcinoma; however, tumor regrowth occurred shortly after the treatment with adozelesin was stopped. Little or no apparent tumor regrowth occurred after treatment with carzelesin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=L. H. |last2=Dekoning |first2=T. F. |last3=Kelly |first3=R.

{{cleanup-reorganize|date=April 2014}}
'''Fed-batch culture''' is, in the broadest sense,  defined as an operational technique in biotechnological processes where one or more nutrients (substrates) are fed (supplied) to the bioreactor during cultivation and in which the product(s) remain in the bioreactor until the end of the run.&lt;ref&gt;Tsuneo Yamanè, Shoichi Shimizu: Fed-batch Techniques in Microbial Processes. Advances in Biochem Eng./Biotechnol 1984, 30:147-194.&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative description of the method is that of a culture in which "a base medium supports initial cell culture and a feed medium is added to prevent nutrient depletion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=How Single-Use, Mini Bioreactors Could Revolutionize Bioprocess Scale-Up | date=25 November 2014 | author=Ngibuini, Mwai | work=Pharmaceutical Processing | publisher=Advantage Business Media | location=United States | url=http://www.pharmpro.com/articles/2014/11/how-single-use-mini-bioreactors-could-revolutionize-bioprocess-scale | deadurl=no&lt;!--added to archive.org--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also a type of '''semi-batch culture'''. In some cases, all the nutrients are fed into the bioreactor. The advantage of the fed-batch culture is that one can control concentration of fed-substrate in the culture liquid at arbitrarily desired levels (in many cases, at low levels).

Generally speaking, fed-batch culture is superior to conventional batch culture when controlling concentrations of a nutrient (or nutrients) affect the yield or productivity of the desired metabolite.

== Types of bioprocesses ==
The types of bioprocesses for which fed-batch culture is effective can be summarized as follows:

1. Substrate inhibition&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

Nutrients such as methanol, ethanol, acetic acid, and aromatic compounds inhibit the growth of microorganisms even at relatively low concentrations. By adding such substrates properly lag-time can be shortened and the inhibition of the cell growth markedly reduced.

2. High cell density (High cell concentration)&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

In a batch culture, to achieve very high cell concentrations, ''e.g.'' 50-100 g of dry cells/L, high initial concentrations of the nutrients in the medium are needed. At such high concentrations, the nutrients become inhibitory, even though they have no such effect at the normal concentrations used in batch cultures.

3. [[Glucose effect]] ([[Crabtree effect]])&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

In the production of baker's yeast from malt wort or molasses it has been recognized since early 1900s that ethanol is produced even in the presence of sufficient dissolved oxygen (DO) if an excess of sugar is present in the culture liquid. Ethanol is a main cause of low cell yield. Aerobic ethanol formation in the presence of glucose concentration is known as glucose effect or Crabtree effect. To reduce this effect, a fed-batch process is generally employed for baker's yeast production. In aerobic cultures of ''Escherichia coli'' and ''Bacillus subtilis'', organic acids such as acetic acid, (and in lesser amounts, lactic acid and formic acid), are produced as byproducts when sugar concentration is high, and these acids inhibit cell growth as well as show deteriorating effect on the metabolic activities. The formation of these acids are called bacterial Crabtree effects.

4. [[Catabolite repression]]&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

When a microorganism is provided with a rapidly metabolizable carbon-energy source such as glucose, the resulting increase in the intracellular concentration of ATP leads to the repression of enzyme(s) biosynthesis, thus causing a slower metabolization of the energy source. This phenomenon is known as catabolite repression. Many enzymes, especially those involved in catabolic pathways, are subject to this repressive regulation. A powerful method of overcoming the catabolite repression in the enzyme biosynthesis is a fed-batch culture in which glucose concentration in the culture liquid is kept low, where growth is restricted, and the enzyme biosynthesis is derepressed. Slow feeding of glucose in penicillin fermentation by ''Penicillium chrysogenum'' is a classical example in the category.

5. [[Auxotrophic mutants]]&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

In a microbial process employing an auxotrophic mutant (nutritionally requiring mutant), excess supply of the required nutrient results in abundant cell growth with little accumulation of the desired metabolite due to feedback inhibition and /or end-product repression. Starvation of the required nutrient, however, lowers cell growth as well as the overall production of the desired metabolite, as the production rate is usually proportional to the cell concentration. In such a bioprocess, the accumulation of the desired metabolite can be maximized by growing the mutant on a limited amount of the required nutrient. To cultivate the mutant on a low concentration of the required nutrient, it is fed to the batch culture at a controlled rate. This technique is often used in industrial amino acid productions with the auxotrophic mutants. An example is lysine production with homoserine- or threonine/methionine-requiring mutant of ''Corynebacterium glutamicum'' being lacking for homoserine dehydrogenase gene.

6. Expression control of a gene with a repressible promoter
 
Transcription of a gene having a repressible promoter upstream of the open reading frame is repressed by combination of the so-called holo-repressor with the operator region on the DNA. When a specified chemical compound exists in the culture liquid, the compound (or its metabolite) in the cells combines as co-repressor with an apo-repressor (a kind of transcription factor) to form the holo-repressor. 
Keeping the concentration of this compound as low as possible (while still allowing for sufficient cell growth) permits continued expression of the regulated gene. Fed-batch culture is a powerful technique to do so.Examples of the repressible promoter are ''trp'' promoter and ''phoA'' promoter.

7. Extension of operation time, supplement of water lost by evaporation, and decreasing viscosity of culture broth&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

==Types of culturing strategies==
=== High cell-density culture ===
The fed-batch strategy is typically used in bio-industrial processes to reach a high cell density in the [[bioreactor]].&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Riesenberg: High-cell-density cultivation of ''Escherichia coli''. Curr Opin Biotechnol 1991, 2:380-384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Yee, Harvey W. Blanch: Recombinant protein expression in high cell density fed-batch cultures of ''Escherichia coli''. Bio/Technology (N Y ) 1992, 10:1550-1556.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sang Yup Lee: High cell-density culture of ''Escherichia coli''. Trends Biotechnol 1996, 14:98-105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JosephShiloach, Rephael Fass : Growing ''E. coli'' to high cell density--a historical perspective on method development. Biotechnol Adv 2005, 23:345-357.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mostly the feed solution is highly concentrated to avoid dilution of the bioreactor.
Production of heterologous proteins by fed-batch cultures of recombinant microorganisms have been extensively studied.&lt;ref&gt;O Mendoza-Vega, J. Sabatie, S. W. Brown: Industrial-Production of Heterologous Proteins by Fed-Batch Cultures of the Yeast ''Saccharomyces-cerevisiae''. FEMS Microbiology Reviews 1994, 15:369-410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulina Balbás: Understanding the art of producing protein and nonprotein molecules in Escherichia coli. Molecular Biotechnology 2001, 19:251-267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer P, Winter J: Expression and fermentation strategies for recombinant protein production in ''Escherichia coli''. In: Merten OW et al. (Eds). Recombinant Protein Production with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. A comparative view on host physiology. 2001, Kluwer Academic Publisher, Dordrecht, The Netherlands. pp. 195-258.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amulya K. Panda: Bioprocessing of therapeutic proteins from the inclusion bodies of ''Escherichia coli''. Adv Biochem Eng Biotechnol 2003, 85:43-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controlled addition of the nutrient directly affects the growth rate of the culture and helps to avoid [[Crabtree effect|overflow metabolism]] (formation of side metabolites, such as [[acetate]] for ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', [[lactic acid]] in mammalian cell cultures, [[ethanol]]  in ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''), oxygen limitation (anaerobiosis).&lt;ref&gt;Jeongseok Lee, Sang Yup Lee, Suwon Park, Anton P. J. Middelberg: Control of fed-batch fermentations. Biotechnol Adv 1999, 17:29-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katie F. Wlaschin, Wei-Shou Hu: Fed-batch culture and dynamic nutrient feeding. Adv Biochem Engin/Biotechnol 2006, 101:43-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constantly-fed-batch culture ===
The simplest fed-batch culture is the one in which the feed rate of a growth-limiting substrate is constant, ''i.e.'' the feed rate is invariant during the culture. This case is shown in the graph (here the culture volume is variable). This type of the fed-batch culture is named constantly-fed-batch culture (CFBC), and is well established mathematically &lt;ref&gt;Tsuneo Yamané, Shigeki Hirano: Semi-batch Culture of Microorganisms with Constant Feed of Substrate - A Mathematical Simulation -. J Ferment Technol 1977, 55:156-165.&lt;/ref&gt; and experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;Tsuneo Yamané, Shigeki Hirano: Semi-batch Culture of Microorganisms with Constant Feed of Substrate - An Experimental Study -. J Ferment Technol 1977, 55:380-387.&lt;/ref&gt; In the CFBC, both cases of fixed-volume CFBC and variable-volume CFBC were studied.

[[Image:Fed batch principle.png|thumb|The graph shows the principle of a substrate limited fed-batch cultivation with an initial batch phase. After consumption of the initial substrate a continuous and constant feed of the substrate is started.]]

=== Exponential-fed-batch culture ===
Under ideal condition, cells grow exponentially. If the feed rate of the growth-limiting substrate is increased in proportion to the exponential growth rate of the cells, it is possible to maintain the cells' specific growth rate for a long time while keeping the substrate concentration in the culture liquid at a constant level. The required feed rate (volumetric or mass) must be increased exponentially with time so that this mode of fed-batch culture is called exponentially-fed-batch culture (EFBC).&lt;ref&gt;Tsuneo Yamane, Michimasa Kishimoto, Fumitake Yoshida: Semi-batch Culture of Methanol-assimilating Bacteria with Exponentially Increased Methanol Feed. J Ferment Technol 1974, 54:229-240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Substrate limitation offers the possibility to control the reaction rates to avoid technological limitations connected to the cooling of the reactor and oxygen transfer. Substrate limitation also allows the metabolic control, to avoid osmotic effects, [[catabolite repression]] and overflow metabolism of side products.&lt;ref&gt;J. Zhang, Randolph Greasham: Chemically defined media for commercial fermentations. Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology 1999, 51:407-421.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Liden: Understanding the bioreactor. Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering 2002, 24:273-279.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Hewitt, Alvin W. Nienow: The scale-up of microbial batch and fed-batch fermentation processes. Adv Appl Microbiol 2007, 62:105-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Freeze-dried ice cream''' is [[ice cream]] that has had most of the water removed from it by a [[freeze-drying]] process, sealed in a pouch, and requires no refrigeration.

It is also known as '''astronaut ice cream''' or '''space ice cream''', typically a slab of ready-to-eat dehydrated [[ice cream]]. Compared to regular ice cream, it can be kept at room temperature without melting and is more brittle and rigid but still soft when bitten into. It was developed by [[Whirlpool Corporation]] under contract to [[NASA]] for the [[Project Apollo|Apollo missions]].&lt;ref name="Space Food"&gt;{{cite web

Freeze-dried foods were developed so that foods could be sent on long-duration spaceflights, as to the Moon, and to reduce the weight of the water and oxygen normally found in food.&lt;ref name="Space Food"/&gt;

[[Freeze drying]] (or lyophilization) removes water from the ice cream by lowering the [[atmospheric pressure|air pressure]] to a point where ice sublimates from a [[solid]] to a [[gas]]. The ice cream is placed in a [[vacuum chamber]] and frozen until the water [[crystallizes]]. The air pressure is lowered, creating a partial vacuum, forcing air out of the chamber; next heat is applied, [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimating]] the ice; finally a freezing coil traps the vaporized water. This process continues for hours, resulting in a freeze-dried ice cream slice.

Freeze-dried ice cream is sold by mail order and is common in [[science museums]] and NASA visitor center [[gift shops]], sometimes accompanied by other freeze-dried foods. They are also for sale in several physical camping stores like [[REI]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rei.com/product/636897/mountain-house-neapolitan-ice-cream-single-serving&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space use==
Despite the common use of images of space walking astronauts in shuttle era space suits on packaging, freeze dried ice cream was not included on any Apollo, Skylab, Space Shuttle, or International Space Station missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/|title=NASA Spinoff homepage|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one NASA [[food scientist]], although freeze-dried ice cream was developed on request, "it wasn't that popular."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/k-4/features/F_Holiday_Dinner_in_Space_prt.htm|title=A Holiday Dinner in Space|date=December 15, 2005|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2009-08-13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100319011717/http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/k-4/features/F_Holiday_Dinner_in_Space_prt.htm|archivedate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional ice cream in space==
During the 1970s, astronauts ate regular ice cream on the [[Skylab]] space station and regular ice cream has also been eaten on the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacetoday.org/SpcShtls/AstronautsEat.html Surprise! Astronauts Eat in orbit]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Skylab]] had a freezer that was used for regular ice cream,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/astronauts/food-history.html |title=History of Food in Space |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=2007-06-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526183320/http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/astronauts/food-history.html |archivedate=2007-05-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally [[Space Shuttle]] and [[International Space Station]] astronauts have taken regular ice cream into space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/blogs/2006/09/16/orbital-ice-cream-atlantis-iss-surprise/|title=Orbital Ice Cream, Atlantis’ ISS Surprise|publisher=LiveScience.com|date=2006-09-16|accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HMS ''Busy''''' was launched in 1797 as the only member of her class of brig-sloops. She captured one French privateer and numerous small merchantmen, but spent most of her career escorting convoys to and from the West Indies. She foundered in 1807 while serving on the [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], station.

==Design==
''Busy'' was the sole vessel of her class. Her designer was [[John Henslow (Surveyor of the Navy)|John Henslow]], and she was identical with his contemporaneous {{HMS|Echo|1797|2}} except that ''Busy'' was a [[brig-sloop]] and ''Echo'' was a [[ship-sloop]].&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winfield (2008), p.282.&lt;/ref&gt; Henslow's designs were in competition with Sir William Rule's designs for a brig-sloop ({{HMS|Cruizer|1797|2}}) and a ship-sloop ({{HMS|Snake|1797|2}}). Rule's brig-sloop design won as the Admiralty ultimately ordered 106 [[Cruizer-class brig-sloop|''Cruizer''-class]] brig-sloops.

==Career==
In December 1797 Commander John Ackworth Ommanney (or Ommaney) commissioned ''Busy'' for the North Sea.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

On 7 August 1798 {{HMS|Speedwell|1780|2}} and ''Busy'' intercepted off [[Goeree-Overflakkee|Goree]] in the North Sea a Swedish convoy under the escort of {{HSwMS|Ulla Fersen|1789|6}}. The British vessels demanded that the Swedes come into port to have their cargo inspected for enemy (French) cargo. Although Sweden was neutral, ''Ulla Fersen''{{'}}s captain acceded to this demand as the two British vessels out-gunned him and he wanted to avoid loss of life. As ''Busy'' was escorting the Swedish vessels into [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|The Downs]] they encountered a British squadron that had been searching for the Swedes. Ommanney then turned the convoy over to the British squadron.&lt;ref name=Marshall304&gt;Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, pp.30406.&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish merchant vessels were inspected, one was seized, and the rest departed. The vessel that was seized was ''Adelarde'', and ''Busy'' ended up sharing the prize money with at least ten other vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=4 October 1800|issue=15299|page=1146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 July 1799 ''Busy'' was in company with the [[Hired armed vessels|hired armed]] [[lugger]] [[Hired armed lugger Fox|''Fox'']] when they captured ''Der Winter''. Then on 2 August they captured ''Vrow Rica'' and ''Neutralitrie'' and two days later ''Elizabeth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=16 November 1802|issue=15533|page=1213}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 August they detained ''Maximilan Fredericks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=18 December 1802|issue=15542|page=1350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 1799 ''Busy'' captured the French privateer [[lugger]] ''Dragon'', of Dunkirk, as ''Dragon'' was coming from Norway. After a short chase along the Dutch coast, Ommaney drove her to anchor in heavy surf about five miles from Egmont.&lt;ref name=NC/&gt; Ten men of her crew that were British subjects tried to escape in one of her boats but eight of the men drowned when the boat upset in the surf.&lt;ref name=Marshall304/&gt; ''Dragon'', Citizen Liard, master, was armed with two with two 12-pounder carronades and fourteen 4-pounder guns, eight of which she had thrown overboard during the chase.{{refn|''Dragon'' had been commissioned in July 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Demeerliac (2004), n°1738, p.218.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} Ommaney sent ''Dragon'' into Yarmouth.&lt;ref name=NC&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 3, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then ''Busy'' took part in the [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]] in 1799. On 28 August 1799, the fleet captured several Dutch hulks and ships in the New Diep, in Holland. ''Babet'' was listed among the vessels qualifying to share in the prize money.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=158|issue=15453|date=13 February 1802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''Busy'' was present at the subsequent [[Vlieter Incident]] on 30 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|page=187|issue=15455|date=28 February 1802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between November and December ''Busy'' was back with her builders who were making good defects in her construction that had been discovered.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

On 7 February 1800 ''Busy'' arrived at Portsmouth with a large convoy from The Downs. Then on 13 February ''Busy'' sailed for the Leeward Islands as one of the escorts for a fleet of 150 merchantmen.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 3, p.155.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Ommanney was on the Leeward Island's Station, ''Busy'' captured or recaptured five vessels:&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=20 September 1800|issue=15295|page=1085-1086}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*26 April: sloop ''Lover'', of 98 tons (bm) and 7 men. She was of Saint croix and was sailing from Guadeluope to saint Croix with sugar and wine when ''busy'' captured her.
*10 May: schooner ''Wheel of Fortune'', of 34 tons (bm) and 6 men. She was sailing from Saint Bartholomew to Sandy Point, st Kitts, with a cargo of sundries.
*12 May: schooner ''Confiance'', of 52 tons and 11 men. She was of and from Saint Bartholomew and was sailing to Cayenne with naval stores.
*26 May: ship ''Britannia'', of 220 tons (bm) and 11 men. She was of and from New Brunswick and before ''Busy'' recaptured her she had been captured while sailing to Jamaica with lumber. 
*19 June: schooner ''Industry'', of 69 tons (bm) and 6 men. She was of Middleton, North America, and before ''Busy'' recaptured her she had been sailing from New London to Martinique with a cargo of cattle when she had been captured.

By July Ommanney's health had deteriorated and he returned to England.&lt;ref&gt;O'Byrne (1849), Vol. 2, p.837.&lt;/ref&gt; The homeward fleet of 170 merchant vessels sailed from Jamaica on 1 August under escort by {{HMS|Queen|1769|6}}, ''Busy'', and two frigates.&lt;ref name=ND&gt;[http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/18-1900/B/00745.html Naval Database: ''Busy'', 1797.]&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Viscount Falkland assumed command of ''Busy'' in September. He received promotion to Commander in January 1801.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; He captured ''San Telmo'', which was condemned at Martinique and sold at Trinidad on 21 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=22 January 1805|issue=15774|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circa 25 May 1802 Lieutenant G. Chamberlayne of {{HMS|Theseus|1786|2}}, was appointed to command ''Busy'' ''pro tempore''.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol.7, 532.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chamberlyne died. A letter from Antigua dated 21 November reported that he had succumbed to [[yellow fever]] and that Lieutenant Thomas Church, of {{HMS|Excellent|1787|2}} had replaced him in command of ''Busy''.&lt;ref name=ND/&gt;

Following the Peace of Amiens in March 1802, there was an announcement on 21 July that when they arrived from Jamaica, eight sail of the line, four frigates, and five sloops, including ''Busy'', would be laid up at Plymouth Dockyard.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 8, p.84.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 1803 Lieutenant Timothy Clinch was promoted to Commander. He assumed command of ''Busy'', either in conjunction with his promotion or not long thereafter. Her role was the protection of the trade to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], and Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1829), Supplement–Part 3, p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, on 4 May 1803 ''Busy'' arrived at Barbados from Antigua. She sailed from there on 1 August as escort for the Leeward Islands convoy. On the way the convoy encountered a gale.&lt;ref name=ND/&gt; The ships ''Eagle'' and ''Stanley'' were lost, though their crews were saved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.c2735021?urlappend=%3Bseq=157 ''[[Lloyd's List]]'' №4389.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Busy'' parted from the convoy and there were reports that she too had been lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=upenn_main&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;docId=CS34219329&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 "Thursday being the Birth-day of her Royal Highness the Duchess of WIRTEMBURGH, her." Times [London, England] 1 Oct. 1803: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 29 Jan. 2018.[]&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 4 October ''The Times of London'' reported that ''Busy'' had arrived at [[Cork (city)|Cork]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=upenn_main&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=&amp;docId=CS51258692&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 "Ship News." Times &amp;#91;London, England&amp;#93; 4 Oct. 1803: 3. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 29 Jan. 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October ''Busy'', with the convoy for Newfoundland and Halifax, got under weigh at Portsmouth but brought to again when the wind dropped. They all sailed the following day with [[French corvette Diligente (1794)|''Diligente'']] in company.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 10, p.515.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Busy'' returned to Portsmouth on 28 November. She sailed for a cruise off Cherbourg with {{HMS|Tribune|1803|2}} and {{HMS|Pluto|1782|2}} on 27 January 1804 and returned on 12 February.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 11, pp.172-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Clinch sailed from Portsmouth for West Indies station on 13 April 1804. On 10 June he arrived at Barbados from Falmouth, having escorted about 46 vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=upenn_main&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;docId=CS34350843&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 "The Mary, Capt.

Web. 29 Jan. 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; On the 25th of June ''Busy'' recaptured an English ship with a cargo of sundries.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=8 September 1804|issue=15735|page=1121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 September 1804 Lieutenant William Henry Byam, of {{HMS|Osprey|1797|2}} received a promotion to Commander and on 1 December he took command of ''Busy'' on the Halifax station.&lt;ref name=M2&gt;Marshall (1828), Supplement-Part 2, p.313.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Commander Timothy Clinch moved to ''Osprey''. Byam left ''Busy'' in October 1805 for {{HMS|Bermuda|1805|2}}.&lt;ref name=M2/&gt;

''Busy'' remained on the Halifax station and from 1806 she was under the command of Lieutenant Richard Keilly (or Keilly).&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

==Fate==
''Busy'', Lieutenant Richard Keilly, disappeared off Halifax in February 1807 in a storm. She was presumed to have foundered with all hands.&lt;ref&gt;Hepper (1994), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human sexual activity''', '''human sexual practice''' or '''human sexual behaviour''' is the manner in which humans experience and express their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. People engage in a variety of sexual acts, ranging from activities done alone (e.g., [[masturbation]]) to acts with another person (e.g., [[sexual intercourse]], [[non-penetrative sex]], [[oral sex]], etc.) in varying patterns of frequency, for a wide variety of reasons. Sexual activity usually results in [[sexual arousal]] and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle. Sexual activity may also include conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another or enhance the [[sex life]] of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners ([[courtship]] and [[Display (zoology)|display]] behaviour), or personal interactions between individuals (for instance, [[foreplay]] or [[BDSM]]). Sexual activity may follow sexual arousal.

Human sexual activity has sociological, cognitive, [[Emotional intimacy|emotional]], [[Physical intimacy|behavioural]] and biological aspects; these include [[Human bonding|personal bonding]], sharing emotions and the [[physiology]] of the [[reproductive system]], [[sex drive]], sexual intercourse and sexual behaviour in all its forms.

In some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within marriage, while [[Premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]] are taboo. Some sexual activities are illegal either universally or in some countries or subnational jurisdictions, while some are considered contrary to the [[Norm (social)|norm]]s of certain societies or cultures. Two examples that are criminal offences in most&lt;!--virtually all?--&gt; [[jurisdiction]]s are [[sexual assault]] and sexual activity with a person below the local [[age of consent]].

Sexual activity can be classified in a number of ways: acts which involve one person (also called [[autoeroticism]]) such as [[masturbation]], or two or more people such as [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]], [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]] or [[mutual masturbation]]. If there are more than two participants in the sex act, it may be referred to as [[group sex]]. Autoerotic sexual activity can involve use of [[dildo]]s, [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]]s, [[anal beads]], and other [[sex toy]]s, though these devices can also be used with a partner.

Sexual activity can be classified into the [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]] of the participants, as well as by the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, [[intimate partner]]s, casual [[sex partners]] or [[anonymous sex|anonymous]]. Sexual activity can be regarded as [[conventional sex|conventional]] or as [[Kink (sexual)|alternative]], involving, for example, [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], [[paraphilia]], or [[BDSM]] activities.&lt;ref name="channel1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |title=Sex and Relationships |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504202257/http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526192917/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 May 2012 |title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better. Think again – Sexual Fitness – physiology &amp;#124; Men's Fitness |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetishism can take many forms ranging from the desire for certain body parts, for example large breasts, navels or foot worship. The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include [[erotic asphyxiation]] and [[self-bondage]]. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes ([[Fainting game|choking]] and [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]], respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.

Sexual activity can be consensual, which means that both or all participants agree to take part and are of the age that they can consent, or it may take place under force or duress, which is often called [[sexual assault]] or rape. In different cultures and countries, various sexual activities may be lawful or illegal in regards to the age, gender, marital status or other factors of the participants, or otherwise contrary to [[social norms]] or generally accepted [[sexual morals]].

==Mating strategies==
In [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[behavioral ecology]], human mating strategies are a set of behaviors used by individuals to attract, select, and retain [[Mating|mates]]. Mating strategies overlap with [[reproductive]] strategies, which encompass a broader set of behaviors involving the timing of reproduction and the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring (see [[life history theory]]).

Relative to other animals, human mating strategies are unique in their relationship with cultural variables such as the institution of [[marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Low, B. S. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=8K7Hc09xcQAC&amp;pg=PA449#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ecological%20and%20socio-cultural%20impacts%20on%20mating%20and%20marriage%22 Ecological and socio-cultural impacts on mating and marriage]. Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, 449.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans may seek out individuals with the intention of forming a long-term [[intimate relationship]], marriage, [[casual relationship]], or [[friendship]]. The human desire for [[companionship]] is one of the strongest human drives. It is an innate feature of human nature, and may be related to the [[sex drive]]. The human mating process encompasses the social and cultural processes whereby one person may meet another to assess suitability, the [[courtship]] process and the process of forming an [[interpersonal relationship]]. Commonalities, however, can be found between humans and nonhuman animals in mating behavior (see [[animal sexual behavior]]).

==Stages of physiological arousal during sexual stimulation==
[[File:Kama sutra 24 detail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This Indian [[Kama sutra]] illustration, which shows a woman on top of a man, depicts the male erection, which is one of the physiological responses to sexual arousal for men.]]
The [[Human sexual response cycle|physiological responses]] during [[sexual stimulation]] are fairly similar for both men and women and there are four phases.&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book | authors=Daniel L.

* During the excitement phase, muscle tension and blood flow increase in and around the sexual organs, heart and respiration increase and blood pressure rises. Men and women experience a "[[sex flush]]" on the skin of the upper body and face. Typically, a woman's [[vagina]] becomes lubricated and her [[clitoris]] becomes swollen.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt; A man's penis will become erect.
* During the plateau phase, heart rate and muscle tension increase further. A man's urinary bladder closes to prevent urine from mixing with [[semen]]. A woman's clitoris may withdraw slightly and there is more lubrication, outer swelling and muscles tighten and reduction of diameter.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt;
* During the [[orgasm]] phase, breathing becomes extremely rapid and the pelvic muscles begin a series of rhythmic contractions. Both men and women experience quick cycles of muscle contraction of lower pelvic muscles and women often experience uterine and vaginal contractions; this experience can be described as intensely pleasurable, but roughly 15% of women never experience orgasm and half report having [[Fake orgasm|faked it]].&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt; A large genetic component is associated with how often women experience orgasm.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt;
* During the resolution phase, muscles relax, blood pressure drops, and the body returns to its resting state. Though generally reported that women do not experience a [[Refractory period (sex)|refractory period]] and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms soon after the first,&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=134–135|accessdate = 17 September 2012| isbn = 9780618755714 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SOC&gt;{{cite web| title = The Sexual Response Cycle| publisher = [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] | url = http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/the-sexual-response-cycle|accessdate =6 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725051823/http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/the-sexual-response-cycle|archivedate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; some sources state that both men and women experience a refractory period because women may also experience a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiner &amp; Craighead"&gt;{{cite book | authors=Irving B.

[[Sexual dysfunction]] is the inability to react emotionally or physically to sexual stimulation in a way projected of the average healthy person; it can affect different stages in the sexual response cycles, which are desire, excitement and orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;Kontula, O &amp; Mannila, E (2009).

==Psychological aspects==
Sexual activity can lower blood pressure and overall stress levels, regardless of age.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} It serves to release tension, elevate mood, and possibly create a profound sense of relaxation, especially in the postcoital period. From a biochemical perspective, sex causes the release of endorphins and increases levels of white blood cells that actually boost the immune system. A study published in the journal Biological Psychology described how men who had had sex the previous night responded better to stressful situations, it suggested that if a person is regularly sexual, they're regularly relaxed, and when the person is relaxed, they cope better with stressful situations. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}} A 2007 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior 36, (no. 3 (June 2007): 357–68) reported that sexual behavior with a partner on one day significantly predicted lower negative mood and stress, and higher positive mood, on the following day.

===Motivations===
{{anchor|Reasons_for_sexual_activity}}
{{Redirect|Pity sex|the American rock band|Pity Sex}}
People engage in sexual activity for any of a multitude of possible reasons. Although the primary evolutionary purpose of sexual activity is reproduction, research on college students suggested that people have sex for four general reasons: ''physical attraction'', as a ''means to an end'', to increase ''emotional connection'', and to ''alleviate insecurity''.&lt;ref&gt;Meston &amp; Buss, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people engage in sexual activity because of pleasure they derive from the [[sexual arousal|arousal of their sexuality]], especially if they can achieve [[orgasm]]. Sexual arousal can also be experienced from [[foreplay]] and flirting, and from [[Fetishism|fetish]] or BDSM activities,&lt;ref name="channel1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526192917/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-05-26 | title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better. Think again&amp;nbsp;— Sexual Fitness&amp;nbsp;— physiology | year=2002 | work=Men's Fitness}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[Eroticism|erotic activities]]. Most commonly, people engage in sexual activity because of the [[sexual desire]] generated by a person to whom they feel [[sexual attraction]]; but they may engage in sexual activity for the physical satisfaction they achieve in the absence of attraction for another, as in the case of [[Casual sex|casual or social sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/casual%20sex|title=Casual sex - Define Casual sex at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, a person may engage in a sexual activity solely for the sexual pleasure of their partner, such as because of an obligation they may have to the partner or because of love, sympathy or pity they may feel for the partner.

A person may engage in sexual activity for purely monetary considerations, or to obtain some advantage from either the partner or the activity. A man and woman may engage in sexual intercourse with the objective of [[Fertilisation|conception]]. Some people engage in hate sex, which occurs between two people who strongly dislike or annoy each other. It is related to the idea that opposition between two people can heighten [[sexual tension]], attraction and interest.&lt;ref name=Holbrook1972 &gt;{{Cite book | last=Holbrook | first=David | year=1972 | title=The masks of hate: the problem of false solutions in the culture of an acquisitive society | publisher=Pergamon Press | page=118 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWYIAQAAIAAJ | isbn=978-0-08-015799-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that sexual activity plays a large part in the interaction of social species. [[Joan Roughgarden]], in her book ''Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People,'' postulates that this applies equally to humans as it does to other social species. She explores the purpose of sexual activity and demonstrates that there are many functions facilitated by such activity including pair bonding, group bonding, dispute resolution and reproduction.&lt;ref name=Roughgarden2004 &gt;{{Cite book | last=Roughgarden | first=Joan | year=2004 | title= Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People| publisher=[[University of California Press]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dASsUFtN57sC | isbn=978-0-520-24073-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-determination theory===
Research has found that people also engage in sexual activity for reasons associated with [[self-determination theory]]. The self-determination theory can be applied to a sexual relationship when the participants have positive feelings associated with the relationship. These participants do not feel guilty or coerced into the partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Knee C.R. |author2=Lonsbary C. |author3=Canevello A. |author4=Patrick H. | year = 2005 | title = Self-determination and conflict in romantic relationships | url = | journal = J Pers Soc Psychol | volume = 89 | issue = 6| pages = 997–1009 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.89.6.997 |pmid=16393030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have proposed the model of self-determined sexual motivation.  The purpose of this model is to connect self-determination and sexual motivation.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brunell A.B. |author2=Webster G.D. | year = 2013 | title = Self-Determination and Sexual Experience in Dating Relationships | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 39 | issue = 7| pages = 970–987 | doi = 10.1177/0146167213485442 |pmid=23613122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model has helped to explain how people are sexually motivated when involved in self-determined dating relationships. This model also links the positive outcomes, (satisfying the need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness) gained from sexual motivations.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt;

According to the completed research associated with this model, it was found that people of both sexes who engaged in sexual activity for self-determined motivation had more positive psychological well-being.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; While engaging in sexual activity for self-determined reasons, the participants also had a higher need for fulfillment.  When this need was satisfied, they felt better about themselves. This was correlated with greater closeness to their partner and higher overall satisfaction in their relationship.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; Though both sexes engaged in sexual activity for self-determined reasons, there were some differences found between males and females.  It was concluded that females had more motivation than males to engage in sexual activity for self-determined reasons.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; Females also had higher satisfaction and relationship quality than males did from the sexual activity.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; Overall, research concluded that psychological well-being, sexual motivation, and sexual satisfaction were all positively correlated when dating couples partook in sexual activity for self-determined reasons.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt;

==Frequency==
{{globalize|section|date=June 2015}}
{{See also|Sexually active life expectancy}}
The frequency of sexual activity might range from zero ([[sexual abstinence]]) to 15 or 20 times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Osbourne |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sexual-health/HQ01363 |title=Sexual health: An interview with a Mayo Clinic specialist |website=[[Mayo Clinic|MayoClinic.com]] |date=2 December 2004 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051206023204/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sexual-health/HQ01363 |archivedate=6 December 2005 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the average frequency of sexual intercourse for married couples is 2 to 3 times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]], the average frequency of sexual intercourse in the US for individuals who have partners is 112 times per year (age 18–29), 86 times per year (age 30–39), and 69 times per year (age 40–49).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html#frequency | title = Frequently asked questions to the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction Kinsey Institute|accessdate = 6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescents===
{{See also|Adolescent sexuality}}
The age at which adolescents tend to become sexually active varies considerably between different cultures and from time to time. (See [[Virginity#Prevalence of virginity|Prevalence of virginity]].) The first sexual act of a child or adolescent is sometimes referred to as the [[sexualization]] of the child, and may be considered as a milestone or a change of status, as the loss of [[virginity]] or innocence. Youth are legally free to have intercourse after they reach the [[age of consent]].

A 1999 survey of students indicated that approximately 40% of ninth graders across the United States report having had sexual intercourse. This figure rises with each grade. Males are more sexually active than females at each of the grade levels surveyed. Sexual activity of young adolescents differs in ethnicity as well. A higher percent of African American and Hispanic adolescents are sexually active than White adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Meece, Judith L. Child and Adolescent Development for Educators. New York: McGraw Hill, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on sexual frequency has also been conducted solely on female adolescents who engage in sexual activity.  Female adolescents tended to engage in more sexual activity due to positive mood. In female teenagers, engaging in sexual activity was directly positively correlated with being older, greater sexual activity in the previous week or prior day, and more positive mood the previous day or the same day as the sexual activity occurred.&lt;ref name="Fortenberry D.J., Temkit M., Tu W., Graham C.A., Katz B. 2005 252–257"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fortenberry D.J. |author2=Temkit M. |author3=Tu W. |author4=Graham C.A. |author5=Katz B. | year = 2005 | title = Daily Mood, Partner Support, Sexual Interest, and Sexual Activity Among Adolescent Women | url = http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/4803| journal = Health Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 252–257 | doi = 10.1037/0278-6133.24.3.252 |pmid=15898860 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreased sexual activity was associated with prior or current day negative mood or menstruating.&lt;ref name="Fortenberry D.J., Temkit M., Tu W., Graham C.A., Katz B. 2005 252–257"/&gt;

Although opinions differ, others{{who|date=September 2016}} suggest that sexual activity is an essential part of humans, and that teenagers need to experience sex.  According to a research study, sexual experiences help teenagers understand pleasure and satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Vrangalova, Z. 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vrangalova|first=Zhana|last2=Savin-Williams|first2=Ritch C.|date=1 August 2011|title=Adolescent sexuality and positive well-being: a group-norms approach|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=40|issue=8|pages=931–944|doi=10.1007/s10964-011-9629-7|issn=1573-6601|pmid=21274608}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, it stated that teenagers can positively benefit from sexual activity. The cross-sectional study was conducted in 2008 and 2009 at a rural upstate New York community. Teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 16 revealed a higher well-being than those who were sexually inexperienced or who were first sexually active at a later age of 17.&lt;ref name="Vrangalova, Z. 2011"/&gt; Furthermore, teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 15 or younger, or who had many sexual partners were not negatively affected and did not have associated lower well-being.&lt;ref name="Vrangalova, Z. 2011"/&gt;

==Health and safety==
Sexual activity is an innately physiological function,&lt;ref&gt;Xiaojun Chen, Xuerui Tan, Qingying Zhang, [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.598.3719  " Cardiovascular effects of sexual activity"], ''Medknow Publications'', December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but like other physical activity, it comes with risks. There are four main types of risks that may arise from sexual activity: [[Unintended pregnancy|unwanted pregnancy]], contracting a [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]] (STI/STD), physical injury, and psychological injury.

===Unwanted pregnancy===
{{main|Unintended pregnancy}}
Any sexual activity that involves the introduction of semen into a woman's vagina, such as during sexual intercourse, or even contact of semen with her vulva, may result in a pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/975.aspx | title=Can I get pregnant if I have sex without penetration? | publisher=[[National Health Service]] | accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies, some people who engage in penile-vaginal sex may use [[birth control|contraception]], such as [[birth control pill]]s, a [[condom]], [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]s, [[spermicide]]s, [[hormonal contraception]] or sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contraception.about.com/od/contraceptionoverview/g/glossary.htm Dawn Stacey: Contraception. About.com.] Retrieved 11 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the various contraceptive methods in avoiding pregnancy varies considerably.

===Sexually transmitted infections===
[[File:Préservatif enroulé.jpg|thumb|right|A rolled-up male [[condom]]]]
{{Main|Sexually transmitted infection}}
Sexual activity that involves skin-to-skin contact, exposure to an infected person's [[bodily fluid]]s or [[mucosal membrane]]s&lt;ref&gt;

Typically, older men and women maintaining interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; it is a way of expressing their love and care for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood have been found to contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women were more likely to report a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both genders in the study agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Kontula, O., &amp; Haavio-Mannila, E.

Heterosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the opposite sex. Heterosexual sexual practices are subject to laws in many places. In some countries, mostly those where religion has a strong influence on [[social policy]], marriage laws serve the purpose of encouraging people to have sex only within marriage. [[Sodomy laws]] were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices, but may affect opposite-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing [[sexual abuse]], committing sexual acts with anyone under an [[age of consent]], performing sexual activities in public, and engaging in sexual activities for money (prostitution). Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activities, they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex sexual activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://criminal.findlaw.com/crimes/more-criminal-topics/sex-offenders/sex-offenses-overview.html Sex Offenders and Sex Offenses: Overview. From FindLaw.] Retrieved 13 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different-sex sexual practices may be [[monogamy|monogamous]], serially monogamous, or [[Polyamory|polyamorous]], and, depending on the definition of sexual practice, [[abstinence|abstinent]] or [[Autosexuality|autoerotic]] (including [[masturbation]]). Additionally, different religious and political movements have tried to influence or control changes in sexual practices including courting and marriage, though in most countries changes occur at a slow rate.

===Homosexuality===

[[File:An ottoman miniature from the book Sawaqub al-Manaquib depicting Homosexuality.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Ottoman miniature from the book ''Sawaqub al-Manaquib'' depicting homosexuality]]
Homosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the same sex. People with a homosexual orientation can express their sexuality in a variety of ways, and may or may not express it in their behaviors.&lt;ref name=APAHelp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 |title=Psychology Help Center |publisher=Apahelpcenter.org |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051520/http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that many gay men and lesbians want, and succeed in having, committed and durable relationships. For example, survey data indicate that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=WhatIsNature&gt;[http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/orientation.aspx#accordion1_content_11 What is the nature of same-sex relationships?] American Psychological Association, Retrieved 25 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for a person whose sexual identity is mainly heterosexual to engage in sexual acts with people of the same sex. For example, mutual masturbation in the context of what may be considered normal heterosexual teen development. Gay and lesbian people who pretend to be heterosexual are often referred to as being [[closeted]] (hiding their sexuality in "the closet"). "Closet case" is a derogatory term used to refer to people who hide their sexuality. Making that orientation public can be called "[[coming out of the closet]]" in the case of voluntary disclosure or "[[outing]]" in the case of disclosure by others against the subject's wishes (or without their knowledge). Among some communities (called "men on the DL" or "[[Down-low (sexual slang)|down-low]]"), same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure. [[Men who have sex with men]], as well as [[women who have sex with women]], or men on the "down-low" may engage in sex acts with members of the same sex while continuing sexual and romantic relationships with the opposite sex.

People who engage exclusively in same-sex sexual practices may not identify themselves as gay or lesbian. In sex-segregated environments, individuals may seek relationships with others of their own gender (known as [[situational homosexuality]]). In other cases, some people may experiment or explore their sexuality with same (or different) sex sexual activity before defining their [[sexual identity]]. Despite stereotypes and common misconceptions, there are no forms of sexual acts exclusive to same-sex sexual behavior that cannot also be found in opposite-sex sexual behavior, except those involving the meeting of the genitalia between same-sex partners&amp;nbsp;– [[tribadism]] (generally [[vulva]]-to-vulva rubbing, commonly known by its "scissoring" position) and [[frot]] (generally [[Human penis|penis]]-to-penis rubbing).

===Bisexuality and pansexuality===
{{Main|Bisexuality|Pansexuality}}
People who have a romantic or sexual attraction to both sexes are referred to as bisexual.&lt;ref name="apahelp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx |title=Sexual Orientation, Homosexuality, and Bisexuality |periodical=[[American Psychological Association|APA]]HelpCenter.org |accessdate=18 September 2012 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Other social aspects==
===General attitudes===

[[Alex Comfort]] and others propose three potential social aspects of sexual intercourse in humans, which are not mutually exclusive: reproductive, relational, and recreational.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking (1972) by [[Alex Comfort]]. See also {{ISBN|1-4000-4614-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the contraceptive pill]] and other highly effective forms of [[contraception]] in the mid- and late 20th century has increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, which still overlap a great deal and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have intercourse while using contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational) and also as a means of emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Religious and ethical===
{{Main|Sexual morality|Religion and sexuality|Norm (sociology)}}
[[File:Khajuraho-Lakshmana Temple erotic detal1.JPG|thumb|Erotic sculptures found in a medieval [[Khajuraho|Hindu]] temple in India]]
Most world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed [[moral code]]s covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc. Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's sexual activities and practices. However, the effect of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of [[extramarital sex|extramarital sexual relations]], it has always been widely practiced. Nevertheless, these religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behavior, speech etc.

On the other hand, some people adopt the view that pleasure is its own justification for sexual activity. [[Hedonism]] is a school of thought which argues that pleasure is the only [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic good]].&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hedonism/ Hedonism], 20 April 2004 ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Human sexual activity, like many other kinds of activity engaged in by humans, is generally influenced by social rules that are culturally specific and vary widely. These social rules are referred to as [[Sexual ethics|sexual morality]] (what can and can not be done by society's rules) and sexual norms (what is and is not expected).

Sexual ethics, morals, and norms relate to issues including deception/honesty, legality, [[fidelity]] and consent. Some activities, known as [[Sex and the law|sex crimes]] in some locations, are illegal in some jurisdictions, including those conducted between (or among) consenting and competent adults (examples include [[sodomy law]] and adult-adult [[incest]]).

Some people who are in a relationship but want to hide polygamous activity (possibly of opposite sexual orientation) from their partner, may solicit consensual sexual activity with others through personal contacts, [[online chat room]]s, or, advertising in select media.

[[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinging]], on the other hand, involves singles or partners in a [[committed relationship]] engaging in sexual activities with others as a [[recreational sex|recreational]] or social activity.&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing popularity of swinging is regarded by some as arising from the upsurge in sexual activity during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s. Swinging sexual activity can take place in a [[sex club]], also known as a swinger club (not to be confused with a [[strip club]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swingingheaven.co.uk/advice/swingers-clubs.html|title=Advice on Swingers' Clubs|publisher=Swinging Heaven|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people engage in various sexual activities as a business transaction. When this involves having sex with, or performing certain actual sexual acts for another person in exchange for money or something of value, it is called prostitution. Other aspects of the [[Sex industry|adult industry]] include [[phone sex]] operators, [[strip club]]s, and pornography.

===Gender roles and the expression of sexuality===
Social [[gender roles]] can influence sexual behavior as well as the reaction of individuals and communities to certain incidents; the [[World Health Organization]] states that, "Sexual violence is also more likely to occur where beliefs in male sexual entitlement are strong, where gender roles are more rigid, and in countries experiencing high rates of other types of violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/summary_en.pdf |title=World report on violence and health – World Health Organization |format=PDF |date=27 August 2002 |author=T.G.V. |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some societies, such as those where the concepts of [[family honor]] and female [[chastity]] are very strong, may practice violent control of female sexuality, through practices such as [[honor killings]] and [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=WHO – Female genital mutilation|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/|title=BBC – Ethics: Honour Crimes|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between [[gender equality]] and sexual expression is recognized, and promotion of equity between men and women is crucial for attaining [[sexual health|sexual]] and [[reproductive health]], as stated by the UN [[International Conference on Population and Development]] Program of Action:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/1997/box9.htm |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070817053022/http://www.unfpa.org/swp/1997/box9.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 August 2007 |title=Paragraph 7.34 of the ICPD Programme of Action |work=Sexuality and Gender Relations |accessdate=25 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Human sexuality and gender relations are closely interrelated and together affect the ability of men and women to achieve and maintain sexual health and manage their reproductive lives. Equal relationships between men and women in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the physical integrity of the human body, require mutual respect and willingness to accept responsibility for the consequences of sexual behaviour. Responsible sexual behaviour, sensitivity and equity in gender relations, particularly when instilled during the formative years, enhance and promote respectful and harmonious partnerships between men and women."

==BDSM ==

{{Main|BDSM}}
BDSM is a variety of [[Eroticism|erotic]] practices or [[Sexual roleplay|roleplaying]] involving [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[dominance and submission]], [[sadomasochism]], and other interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent on [[self-identification]] and shared experience. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include [[cross-dresser]]s, extreme [[body modification]] enthusiasts, [[animal roleplay|animal players]], latex or [[rubber fetishism|rubber aficionados]], and others.

B/D, a form of BDSM, is bondage and discipline. Bondage includes the restraint of the body or mind.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perks, problems, and the people who play: A qualitative exploration of dominant and submissive BDSM roles|journal = The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality|date = 1 January 2015|volume = 24|issue = 1|doi = 10.3138/cjhs.2467|first = Ali|last = Hébert|first2 = Angela|last2 = Weaver|pages=49–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; D/S means "dominant and submissive." A dominant is someone who takes control of someone who wishes to give up control. A submissive is someone who gives up the control to a person who wishes to take control.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; S/M (sadism and masochism) means an individual who takes pleasure in the humiliation or pain of others. Masochism means an individual who takes pleasure from their own pain or humiliation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike the usual "power neutral" relationships and play styles commonly followed by couples, activities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants' taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of [[informed consent]] of both the partners becomes essential. Participants who exert sexual dominance over their partners are known as dominants or [[Top (BDSM)|tops]], while participants who take the passive, receiving, or obedient role are known as submissives or [[bottom (BDSM)|bottoms]].

Individuals are also sometimes abbreviated when referred to in writing, so a dominant person may be referred to as a "dom" for a man or a woman.  Sometimes a woman may choose to use the female specific term "Domme".  Both terms are pronounced the same when spoken.  Individuals who can change between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles—whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship—are known as ''switches''. The precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate within the community.&lt;ref name="Terms"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grau|first=Johnson|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm|title=What do B&amp;D, S&amp;M, D&amp;S, "top", "bottom" mean|publisher=Leather Roses|date=1995|accessdate=27 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080111223259/http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm| archivedate= 11 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Submissivepup.jpg|thumb]]
In a 2013 study, the researchers state that BDSM is a sexual act where they play role games, use restraint, use power exchange,
use suppression and pain is sometimes involved depending on individual(s).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Psychological Characteristics of BDSM Practitioners|journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine|date = 1 January 2013|volume = 10|issue = 8|doi = 10.1111/jsm.12192|pmid = 23679066|first = Andreas A.J.|last = Wismeijer|first2 = Marcel A.L.M. van|last2 = Assen|pages=1943–1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study serves to challenge the widespread notion that BDSM could be in some way linked to [[psychopathology]]. According to the findings, one who participates in BDSM may have greater strength socially and mentally as well as greater independence than those who do not practice BDSM.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It suggests that people who participate in BDSM play have higher subjective well-being, and that this might be due to the fact that BDSM play requires extensive communication. Before any sexual act occurs, the partners must discuss their agreement of their relationship. They discuss how long the play will last, the intensity, their actions, what each participant needs or desires. The sexual acts are all recorded as consensual and pleasurable to both parties.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a 2015 study, interviewed BDSM participants have mentioned that the activities have helped to create higher levels of connection, intimacy, trust and communication between partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study suggests that dominants and submissives exchange control for each other's pleasure and to satisfy a need. The participants have remarked that they enjoy pleasing their partner in any way they can and many surveyed have felt that this is one of the best things about BDSM. It gives a submissive pleasure to do things in general for their dominant. Where a Dominant enjoys making their encounters all about the submissive. They enjoy doing things that makes their submissive happy. The findings indicate that the surveyed submissives and dominants found BDSM play more pleasurable and fun. The participants have also mentioned improvements in their personal growth, romantic relationships, sense of community and self, the dominant's confidence, and their coping with everyday things by giving them a psychological release.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legal issues==
{{Main|Sex and the law}}
There are many laws and social customs which prohibit, or in some way affect sexual activities. These laws and customs vary from country to country, and have varied over time. They cover, for example, a prohibition to non-consensual sex, to sex outside marriage, to sexual activity in public, besides many others. Many of these restrictions are non-controversial, but some have been the subject of public debate.

Most societies consider it a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual acts or to engage in sexual activity with someone who does not consent. This is called [[sexual assault]], and if sexual penetration occurs it is called rape, the most serious kind of sexual assault. The details of this distinction may vary among different legal jurisdictions. Also, what constitutes effective consent in sexual matters varies from culture to culture and is frequently debated. Laws regulating the minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex ([[age of consent]]) are frequently the subject of debate, as is [[adolescent sexual behavior]] in general. Some societies have forced marriage, where consent may not be required.

===Same-sex laws===
{{Main|LGBT rights by country or territory}}
Many locales have laws that limit or prohibit [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex sexual activity]].

===Sex outside marriage===
In the West, sex before marriage is not illegal{{Example needed|date=October 2018}}. There are social taboos and many religions condemn pre-marital sex.

Other studies have analyzed the changing attitudes about sex that American adolescents have outside marriage.  Adolescents were asked how they felt about oral and vaginal sex in relation to their health, social, and emotional well-being.  Overall, teenagers felt that oral sex was viewed as more socially positive amongst their demographic.&lt;ref name="Halpern-Feisher, B.L. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Halpern-Feisher B.L. |author2=Cornell J.L. |author3=Kropp R.Y. |author4=Tschann J.M. | year = 2005 | title = Oral Versus Vaginal Sex Among Adolescents: Perceptions, Attitudes, and Behaviour | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 115 | issue = 4| pages = 845–851 | doi = 10.1542/peds.204-2108 |doi-broken-date=2018-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results stated that teenagers believed that oral sex for dating and non-dating adolescents was less threatening to their overall values and beliefs than vaginal sex was.&lt;ref name="Halpern-Feisher, B.L. 2005"/&gt; When asked, teenagers who participated in the research viewed oral sex as more acceptable to their peers, and their personal values than vaginal sex.&lt;ref name="Halpern-Feisher, B.L. 2005"/&gt;

===Minimum age of sexual activity (age of consent)===
{{Main|Age of consent}}
The laws of each jurisdiction set the minimum age at which a young person is allowed to engage in sexual activity.&lt;ref name="waites"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waites| first = Matthew|title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn= 978-1-4039-2173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[age of consent]] is typically between 14 and 18 years, but laws vary. In many jurisdictions, age of consent is a person's mental or functional age.&lt;ref name="kopple-wolf1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html |title=Kopple-Wolf.com |publisher=Kopple-Wolf.com |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605002946/http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html |archivedate=5 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kopple-wolf1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="supremecourt1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/1999/apr99/126545.htm |title=People vs Floers: 126545: April 21, 1999: J.

No. 126921 |publisher=Lawphil.net |accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many jurisdictions regard any sexual activity by an adult involving a child as [[child sexual abuse]].

Age of consent may vary by the type of sexual act, the sex of the actors, or other restrictions such as abuse of a [[position of trust]]. Some jurisdictions also make allowances for young people engaged in sexual acts with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-s-age-of-consent-raised-by-2-years-1.754941|title=Canada's age of consent raised by 2 years|publisher=CBC News|date=1 May 2008|accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incestuous relationships===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}

Most jurisdictions prohibit sexual activity between certain close relatives. These laws vary to some extent; such acts are called [[incest]]uous.

===Sexual abuse===
{{Main|Sexual abuse|Rape|Sexual assault}}

Non-consensual sexual activity or subjecting an unwilling person to witnessing a sexual activity are forms of [[sexual abuse]], as well as (in many countries) certain non-consensual paraphilias such as [[frotteurism]], [[telephone scatophilia]] (indecent phonecalls), and non-consensual [[exhibitionism]] and [[voyeurism]] (known as "[[indecent exposure]]" and "[[Voyeurism|peeping tom]]" respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lawrence Greenfeld |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/SOO.PDF |format=PDF |title=Sex Offenses and Offenders |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |date=6 February 1997 |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution and survival sex===
{{main|Prostitution}}
People sometimes exchange sex for money or access to other resources. This practice, called prostitution, takes place under many varied circumstances. The person who receives payment for sexual services is called a prostitute and the person who receives such services is known by a multitude of terms, including (and most commonly) "john." Prostitution is one of the branches of the [[sex industry]]. The [[prostitution and the law|legal status of prostitution]] varies from [[Prostitution by country|country to country]], from being a punishable crime to a regulated profession. Estimates place the annual revenue generated from the global prostitution industry to be over $100&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.havocscope.com/activities/prostitution/| title= Prostitution Market Value| accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution is sometimes referred to as "the world's oldest profession".&lt;ref&gt;The prostitution of women and girls – Page 5; Ronald B. Flowers – 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution may be a voluntary individual activity or facilitated or [[forced prostitution|forced]] by [[pimp]]s.

[[Survival sex]] is a form of prostitution engaged in by people in need, usually when [[homeless]] or otherwise disadvantaged people trade sex for food, a place to sleep, or other [[basic needs]], or for [[Recreational drug use|drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flowers|first=R.

The '''Ice Warriors''' are a [[fictional]] [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] race of [[List of reptilian humanoids|reptilian humanoid]]s in the long-running British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. They were originally created by [[Brian Hayles]], first appearing in the 1967 serial ''[[The Ice Warriors]]'' where they encountered the [[Second Doctor]] and his companions [[Jamie McCrimmon|Jamie]] and [[Victoria Waterfield|Victoria]]. In ''Doctor Who'', the Ice Warriors originated on [[Mars (Doctor Who)|Mars]], which within the series narrative is a dying world. Their early appearances depict the Ice Warriors as attempting to conquer the Earth and escape their planet as early as Earth's [[Quaternary glaciation|Ice Age]].&lt;ref name= "Programme Guide"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Lofficier | first = Jean-Marc | authorlink = Jean-Marc Lofficier | title = The ''Doctor Who'' Programme Guide: Fourth Edition | publisher = [[iUniverse]] | date = 8 May 2003 | pages = 68 | url = | id = | isbn = 0595276180}}&lt;/ref&gt; A frozen group are discovered by an [[Earth]] scientific team who dub them ‘Ice Warriors’ in their first appearance. Despite this not being the name of their species, an Ice Lord later refers to his soldiers as Ice Warriors in the 1974 serial ''[[The Monster of Peladon]]''.&lt;ref name= "Monster"&gt;{{cite web | title=''The Monster of Peladon'' Episode Guide | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/monsterofpeladon/detail.shtml | accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although originally appearing as villains, subsequent appearances have depicted Ice Warriors that have eschewed violence and even ally themselves with the Doctor.&lt;ref name= "Ice Warriors Profile"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Ice Warriors | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rryyj/profiles/ice-warriors | accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been featured in flashback and cameo appearances, in addition to appearing frequently in spin-off media such as novels and audio releases.

Serials were planned for both 1986 and 1990 that were to have featured the Ice Warriors: ''[[Mission to Magnus]]'' featuring the Sixth Doctor and the villain [[Sil (Doctor Who)|Sil]], and ''Ice Time'' featuring the Seventh Doctor. In both instances, the series was placed on a hiatus and the serials scrapped; however, ''[[Mission to Magnus]]'' was novelised by [[Target Books|Target]] and adapted as an audio by [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]], and ''Ice Time'' was revised and released as the audio ''[[Thin Ice (Doctor Who audio)|Thin Ice]]''.

The Ice Warriors returned in the revived series in the [[Doctor Who (series 7)|seventh series]] episode "[[Cold War (Doctor Who)|Cold War]]" (2013) and the [[Doctor Who (series 10)|tenth series]] episode "[[Empress of Mars]]" (2017).

The [[Doctor Who (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''Doctor Who'' ended with ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'', a serial intended to retire the [[Dalek]]s from the series; their creator Terry Nation intended to produce a spin-off in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Doctor Who's Greatest Dalek Episodes: Friday Fiver | url= http://www.digitalspy.com.au/british-tv/s7/doctor-who/tubetalk/a403015/doctor-whos-greatest-dalek-episodes-friday-fiver.html | accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production office was keen to find new recurring monsters to be used instead of the retired Daleks and alongside the popular [[Cyberman|Cybermen]]. [[Brian Hayles]] was approached to create a suitable monster that could be used as a new recurring antagonist for the Doctor. He drew from newspaper reports of a baby mammoth found in 1900 in the Siberian ice, and from his interest in Mars, to create his monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''The Ice Warriors'' | url= http://shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/oo.html | accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Chapman (media historian)|James Chapman]] suggests that director [[Derek Martinus]] drew from the [[Christian Nyby]] film ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' in realising Hayles' scripts, particularly the concept of an alien frozen in ice near an isolated science base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Chapman | first = James | authorlink = James Chapman (media historian) | title = Inside the TARDIS: The Worlds of Doctor Who | publisher = [[I B Tauris]] | date = 19 September 2006 | pages = 66 | url = | id = | isbn = 184511163X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayles had envisioned the Ice Warriors as cybernetic creatures, but designer Martin Baugh, fearing comparisons to the established Cybermen, instead designed costumes with vaguely reptilian features.&lt;ref name= "Ice Warriors Photonovel"&gt;{{cite web | title=''The Ice Warriors'' Introduction | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/photonovels/icewarriors/intro.shtml | accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their first appearance, in 1967’s ''[[The Ice Warriors]]'', they were a success and were brought back in 1969 for a second serial. [[Peter Bryant]], the producer of ''Doctor Who'' by 1969, also felt that a second appearance might better justify the expensive Ice Warrior costumes employed in their debut serial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''The Seeds of Death'' | url= http://shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/xx.html | accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical characteristics==
Martin Baugh was the costume designer for ''The Ice Warriors'' and was responsible for the decision to make the Ice Warriors reptilian humanoids.&lt;ref name= "Ice Warriors Photonovel"/&gt; As a costume designer, Baugh preferred to work with new materials, with Piers D Britton and Graham Sleight noting that, in designing the look of the monsters, Baugh crafted the armour from fibreglass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Britton | first = Piers | authorlink = Piers D Britton | title = Reading Between Designs: Visual Imagery and the Generation of Meaning in The Avengers, The Prisoner, and Doctor Who | publisher = [[University of Texas Press]] | date = 1 June 2003 | pages = 136 | url = | id = | isbn = 0292709277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Sleight"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Sleight | first = Graham | authorlink = Graham Sleight | title = The Doctor's Monsters: Meanings of the Monstrous in Doctor Who | publisher = [[I B Tauris]] | date = 30 October 2012 | pages = 155 | url = | id = | isbn = 1848851782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleight further comments that the sculpting of this armour is reflective of crocodile skin, suggesting their reptilian nature.&lt;ref name= "Sleight"/&gt;

Actors like [[Bernard Bresslaw]] (who portrayed the Ice Warrior Varga in their first appearance) used a sibilant whisper to demonstrate both the reptilian qualities of the monsters as well as to suggest that the Martian atmosphere is composed differently from that of Earth.&lt;ref name= "Sleight"/&gt; The hissing voice is believed to have been developed by Bresslaw.&lt;ref name="Mark Gatiss Radio Times"&gt;{{cite web | title=Doctor Who's Mark Gatiss: Why I wanted to bring back the Ice Warriors | url= http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-04-13/doctor-whos-mark-gatiss-why-i-wanted-to-bring-back-the-ice-warriors | accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice Warriors also have sonic weaponry built into their wrists.&lt;ref name="SFX Ice Warriors"&gt;{{cite web | title=''Doctor Who'': Everything You Need To Know About The Ice Warriors | url= http://www.sfx.co.uk/gallery/doctor-who-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ice-warriors | accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Seeds of Death]]'' introduces an officer caste often referred to as Ice Lords.&lt;ref name= "SFX Ice Warriors"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Sleight | first = Graham | authorlink = Graham Sleight | title = The Doctor's Monsters: Meanings of the Monstrous in Doctor Who | publisher = [[I B Tauris]] | date = 30 October 2012 | pages = 156 | url = | id = | isbn = 1848851782}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are less armoured than their soldier counterparts and lack their mounted sonic weaponry. Common to both the Ice Warriors and Ice Lords are claw-like gloves.

For the return of the characters in 2013's "[[Cold War (Doctor Who)|Cold War]]", these became three-fingered gloves, similar to another Doctor Who alien, [[Sontaran|the Sontarans]].&lt;ref name= "SFX Ice Warriors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorton Redesign"&gt;{{cite web | title=''Doctor Who'': Cold War preview - the Ice Warrior's return offers something for both newcomers and fans | url= http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-04-07/doctor-who-cold-war-preview---the-ice-warriors-return-offers-something-for-both-newcomers-and-fans | accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neill Gorton chose to make the creatures appear “beefier and stronger”, redesigning the Ice Warrior armour to resemble plating. Urethane rubber was used, which is more flexible and comfortable than fibreglass.&lt;ref name= "Gorton Redesign"/&gt; Mark Gatiss says that he insisted on remaining true to the original Ice Warriors design for their return appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mark Gatis Talkes The Return Of The Ice Warriors | url= http://www.sfx.co.uk/2013/04/09/mark-gatiss-talks-the-return-of-the-ice-warriors | accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cold War" also depicts an Ice Warrior removing its armour for the first time within the series, something that the Doctor says is the ultimate disgrace for an Ice Warrior.&lt;ref name= "Cold War"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Cold War | episodelink = Cold War (Doctor Who) | series = Doctor Who | serieslink = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Mark Gatiss]], Director [[Douglas Mackinnon]], Producer [[Marcus Wilson (producer)|Marcus Wilson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC1 | location = London | airdate = 2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode does not feature an entirely unclothed Ice Warrior; however it includes shots of clawed hands in scenes that some reviewers have compared with ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', in addition to a reveal of the Ice Warrior's face during the episode's climax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Review: 'Doctor Who' Hunts for Red October in 'Cold War' | url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2013/04/13/review-doctor-who-hunts-for-red-october-in-cold-war/ | accessdate=15 April 2013 | work=Forbes | first=Carol | last=Pinchefsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Doctor Who 7.08 "Cold War" REVIEW | url= http://www.sfx.co.uk/2013/04/13/doctor-who-7-08-cold-war-review/ | accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cold War" also reveals that the Ice Warrior armour is a bio-mechanical shell intended to protect the Ice Warrior from the cold; as a cold-blooded species, they are susceptible to temperature fluctuations. The shell can be controlled remotely using sonic technology.&lt;ref name= "Cold War"/&gt;

==History==
The Ice Warriors first appeared in the 1967 story ''[[The Ice Warriors]]'', set during a future ice age in the year 3000.&lt;ref name= "Programme Guide"/&gt; A scientific team sent to halt the advance of the glaciers discovers a spacecraft buried underneath the ice, where it has lain for thousands of years together with its Ice Warrior crew. The Martians are revived and attempt to take over the scientific base, but are defeated by the [[Second Doctor]] ([[Patrick Troughton]]) and their ship destroyed as it tries to take off.&lt;ref name="The Ice Warriors"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Ice Warriors|episodelink=The Ice Warriors|series=Doctor Who|serieslink=Doctor Who|credits= Writer [[Brian Hayles]], Director [[Derek Martinus]], Producer [[Innes Lloyd]]|network=[[BBC]]|location=London|date=11 November – 16 December 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They returned in the 1969 serial ''[[The Seeds of Death]]'', which takes place in the mid-21st century. In this story, the world has grown dependent on the [[Teleportation|matter transmission]] system T-Mat, which an Ice Warrior strike forces intends to exploit to conquer Earth. After seizing the T-Mat relay on the Moon, they use it to send seeds that are intended to reduce the atmosphere’s oxygen, resembling the Martian atmosphere and making the [[Terraforming|Earth hospitable for Martian life]]. This plan is foiled by the Second Doctor and his companions Jamie ([[Frazer Hines]]) and [[Zoe Heriot|Zoe]] ([[Wendy Padbury]]), and the invading Martian fleet is sent into an orbit around the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name="The Seeds of Death"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Seeds of Death|episodelink=The Seeds of Death|series=Doctor Who|serieslink=Doctor Who|credits= Writer [[Brian Hayles]] and [[Terrance Dicks]] (uncredited), Director [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]], Producer [[Peter Bryant]]|network=[[BBC]]|location=London|date=25 January – 1 March 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CurseofPeladon IceLord.jpg|thumb|''[[The Curse of Peladon]]'' depicts an Ice Warrior delegation aiding the Doctor.]]

When the Ice Warriors returned in 1972, in ''[[The Curse of Peladon]]'', it was decided by the production team to subvert the audience’s expectations, featuring them as allies of the [[Third Doctor]] ([[Jon Pertwee]]) rather than villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Brief History of Time (Travel): The Curse of Peladon | url= http://shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/mmm.html | accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The serial depicts the Ice Warriors having renounced violence and become members of a Galactic Federation that, besides Mars, also includes Earth, Alpha Centauri and Arcturus. They had been sent as members of a delegation to negotiate for the planet Peladon to join the Federation, where the Third Doctor encounters them after he and his companion [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]) are mistaken for the delegates from Earth. The Doctor initially suspects that the Ice Warriors are behind attempted sabotage to the proceedings; however, he accepts that the Ice Warriors have changed when they save his life.&lt;ref name= "Ice Warriors Profile"/&gt; With the help of the Ice Warriors, the Doctor uncovers a plot by the High Priest, Hepesh ([[Geoffrey Toone]]), and the delegation from Arcturus, a world which is an old enemy of Mars, each with their own motives, to prevent Peladon’s admission to the Federation.&lt;ref name="The Curse of Peladon"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Curse of Peladon|episodelink=The Curse of Peladon|series=Doctor Who|serieslink=Doctor Who|credits= Writer [[Brian Hayles]] and [[Terrance Dicks]] (uncredited), Director [[Lennie Mayne]], Producer [[Barry Letts]]|network=[[BBC]]|location=London|date=29 January – 19 February 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sequel, ''[[The Monster of Peladon]]'', aired in 1974 and was set 50 years after the events of ''The Curse of Peladon''.&lt;ref name= "Monster"/&gt; Here, the Ice Warriors are depicted serving as Federation peacekeeping troops. The Ice Lord Azaxyr, however, leader of this force, was working with Galaxy 5, which was at war with the Federation. Seeking a return to the race's warrior past, he tried to impose martial law and take over Peladon but was stopped by the Peladonians, who were aided by the Third Doctor.&lt;ref name="The Monster of Peladon"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Monster of Peladon|episodelink=The Monster of Peladon|series=Doctor Who|serieslink=Doctor Who|credits= Writer [[Brian Hayles]], Director [[Lennie Mayne]], Producer [[Barry Letts]]|network=[[BBC]]|location=London|date=23 March – 27 April 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As popular recurring monsters, the Ice Warriors have appeared in flashbacks and been referred to throughout the series history. During the Second Doctor’s trial during ''[[The War Games]]'', he lists the Ice Warriors as among many threats he has defended the universe against.&lt;ref name="The War Games"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The War Games|episodelink=The War Games|series=Doctor Who|serieslink=Doctor Who|credits= Writer [[Terrence Dicks]] and [[Malcolm Hulke]], Director [[David Maloney]], Producer [[Derrick Sherwin]]|network=[[BBC]]|location=London|date=19 April – 21 May 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Third Doctor serial ''[[The Mind of Evil]]'', when forced to confront his fears by the Keller Machine, he sees images of his past enemies, including the Ice Warriors. The newly-[[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerated]] [[Fifth Doctor]] ([[Peter Davison]]), during a moment of initial instability, makes mention of the Ice Warriors and the Brigadier in the 1981 serial ''[[Castrovalva (Doctor Who)|Castrovalva]]''.&lt;ref name="Castrovalva"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Castrovalva|episodelink=Castrovalva (Doctor Who)|series=Doctor Who|serieslink=Doctor Who|credits= Writer [[Christopher H. Bidmead]], Director [[Fiona Cumming]], Producer [[John Nathan-Turner]]|network=[[BBC]]|location=London|date=4–12 January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been seen as perhaps alluding to an unseen adventure.&lt;ref name="SFX Ice Warriors"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=BBC - Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide - Castrovalva - Details | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/castrovalva/detail.shtml | accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When confronted by alien sentient water in the 2009 episode “[[The Waters of Mars]]”, the [[Tenth Doctor]] ([[David Tennant]]) theorises that the Ice Warriors froze it in an underground glacier to prevent its escape, testing the virus by addressing it in Ancient North Martian as it reacts to his words, referring to them as “a fine and noble race who built an empire out of snow”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = The Waters of Mars | episodelink = The Waters of Mars | series = Doctor Who | serieslink = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]] and [[Phil Ford (writer)|Phil Ford]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[Nikki Wilson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC1 | location = London | airdate = 2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 episode "[[Cold War (Doctor Who)|Cold War]]" is the first to depict the Ice Warriors in the revived series and features the [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) encountering Grand Marshal Skaldak, a legendary warrior who had been trapped in the ice for 5000 years, on a sunken Soviet submarine. It is also the first televised story to depict an Ice Warrior without its armour. After Skaldak escapes from the ice, the crew manage to subdue him, which under Martian Law he believes is a declaration of war by humanity. After failing to communicate with his fleet for rescue or reinforcements, Skaldak leaves his armour and tears apart crew members to forensically study the weaknesses of human anatomy. One crew member, Stepashin ([[Tobias Menzies]]), reveals to Skaldak that the submarine is armed with nuclear missiles that could destroy the planet. Upon returning to his armour, Skaldak prepares to fire the missiles. However, he relents and is rescued by an Ice Warrior spaceship that pulls the submarine through the ice to the surface. Before the spaceship leaves, Skaldak deactivates the warheads.&lt;ref name= "Cold War"/&gt;
[[File:Doctor Who Experience series 10 (35604715033).jpg|thumb|left|The Empress of Mars, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition]]
The Ice Warriors reappear alongside the [[Twelfth Doctor]] in the 2017 episode "[[Empress of Mars]]," featuring the first female Ice Warrior. While female Ice Warriors have been mentioned before, this marks their first onscreen appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-06-05/first-look-at-the-brand-new-female-ice-warrior-in-next-weeks-doctor-who|title=First look at the brand new female Ice Warrior in next week's Doctor Who|date=5 June 2017|last=Doran|first=Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode, a crew of soldiers in the Victorian era help an Ice Warrior who they nickname Friday get home after his crashed ship is salvaged and he is awoken from suspended animation, only for him to discover the planet is dead. Friday awakens the Ice Queen, Iraxxa, who wants to kill the humans. Despite a rebellion by one of the soldiers, Colonel Godsacre, the mission's true commander, negotiates his death as long as she spares the rest of his men and the Earth. Iraxxa is impressed with his bravery, and offers him the chance to join their ranks. Iraxxa awakens several dormant Ice Warriors, and the Doctor calls the Galactic Federation's Alpha Centauri to pick up the remaining Ice Warriors, realizing this is the beginning of the Ice Warrior golden age.

==Other appearances==

===Prose===
[[Target Books|Target]] released a novelisation of ''[[Mission to Magnus]]'' in 1990 written by [[Phillip Martin]]. This is based on a serial intended for [[Doctor Who (season 23)|Season 23]], but this was scrapped after the series was put on an 18-month hiatus in March 1985. The novel features the Ice Warriors allying themselves with the villain [[Sil (Doctor Who)|Sil]] and facing the [[Sixth Doctor]] and [[Peri Brown|Peri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Doctor Who - Mission to Magnus | url=http://www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~ecl6nb/OnTarget/1990/mission/misfacts.htm | accessdate=15 April 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130706193745/http://www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~ecl6nb/OnTarget/1990/mission/misfacts.htm | archivedate=6 July 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They intend to move the planet Magnus Epsilon away from the sun, shifting it into a perpetual winter and turning it into their new home planet. After the Ice Warriors abandon Sil as unnecessary to the completion of their plans, he offers to help the Doctor and Peri defeat them. The Ice Warriors are ultimately destroyed when Magnus Epsilon returns to its original orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mission to Magnus | url= http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_ms03.htm | accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the cancellation of ''Doctor Who'' in 1989, [[Virgin Publishing]] secured a license to publish original ''Doctor Who'' fiction continuing the adventures of the [[Seventh Doctor]]. The Ice Warriors make several appearances in the [[Virgin New Adventures]]. The 1992 [[Ben Aaronovitch]] novel ''[[Transit (Doctor Who)|Transit]]'' is set after a war between humanity and the Ice Warriors called the “Thousand Day War” and depicts a war veteran, Old Sam, making a gesture of peace at the novel’s conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Transit | url= http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_na10.htm | accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Craig Hinton|Craig Hinton’s]] 1996 novel ''[[GodEngine]]'' novel follows on from this, depicting humans and Ice Warriors entering a new era of cooperation after the defeat of a faction allied with [[Dalek]]s who had recently [[The Dalek Invasion of Earth|invaded the Earth]]. This novel also explores the influence of the [[Pyramids of Mars|Osirians]] on Martian culture. The titular GodEngine in particular is shown as an Ice Warrior creation using Osirian technology, with the Daleks intending on replacing the Earth’s magnetic core with the GodEngine after an Ice Warrior faction has completed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=GodEngine | url= http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_na51.htm | accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Legacy (Doctor Who)|Legacy]]'' by [[Gary Russell]], released in 1994, is a sequel to the Peladon stories. It features the Doctor and Ice Warriors dispatched by the Galactic Federation to find a murderer hiding himself in the crowds of a Peladonian ceremony. The novel depicts a strained relationship between the Doctor and the Ice Warriors; he remains suspicious of their motives, and the Ice Lord Savaar is irritated by this suspicion. After the Doctor is implicated in murder, Savaar asks to personally execute the Doctor so as to avenge previous Ice Warrior defeats. The two manage to reconcile and work together to defeat the real killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Legacy | url= http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_na25.htm | accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savaar was among a group of Ice Warriors who later attended [[Bernice Summerfield|Bernice Summerfield's]] wedding in the 1996 novel ''[[Happy Endings (Doctor Who)|Happy Endings]]'' by [[Paul Cornell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Happy Endings | url= http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_na50.htm | accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Dying Days]]'' depicts the [[Eighth Doctor]] preventing an Ice Warrior invasion in 1997, with the aid of the Brigadier and [[Bernice Summerfield]]. The novel reveals that, after the Mars Probe missions, depicted in the 1970 serial ''[[The Ambassadors of Death]]'', Earth made inadvertent hostile contact with the Ice Warriors, which was covered up by British intelligence services. Lord Greyhaven, the minister in charge of the novel’s missions to Mars, has been in contact with the Ice Warriors and aids in their take-over of the United Kingdom. Greyhaven is killed by the Ice Warriors after rethinking his actions and wiping out the Argyre Ice Warrior clan. The invasion attempt is ultimately defeated by the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Dying Days | url= http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_na61.htm | accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] novel [[The Last Resort (Doctor Who)|''The Last Resort'']] features numerous conflicting alternate timelines in which the Martian race has either been enslaved by humans or else has exterminated all but a select human elite to prevent their enslavement. In these realities, Martian life began as a result of bacteria from the decaying corpses of millions of temporal duplicates of a time-travelling teenager called Jack Kowaczski, arriving from millions of parallel timelines on the uninhabitable surface of Mars and dying, changing the Martian atmosphere and evolving. With the timeline breaking down due to the temporal complications of the Martians' existence, the Doctor averts the existence of these Martians by going back in time and taking an infant version of Jack Kowaczski back in time to be raised somewhere he can never build his time machine.

The [[Past Doctor Adventures]] ''[[Fear Itself (Doctor Who novel)|Fear Itself]]'' (which is set shortly after humans colonise Mars) mentions that native Martians (never named explicitly as Ice Warriors) have been forced into poverty and homelessness by humans, except for a few who have resorted to terrorism to reclaim their planet.

In 2011, as part of the [[New Series Adventures]] range, a novel called ''[[The Silent Stars Go By (novel)|The Silent Stars Go By]]'' was released. It was written by [[Dan Abnett]] and features the [[Eleventh Doctor]], together with [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] [[Amy Pond]] and [[Rory Williams]]. The [[TARDIS]] crew accidentally find themselves on an Earth-like planet during winter, sometime in the future. There they come into contact with the Ice Warriors, who are seeking a new home for themselves as both Earth and Mars are currently uninhabitable, but complications arise when they discover that this planet is the subject of an Earth terraforming project.

===Audio===
In the [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audio play ''[[Red Dawn (Doctor Who audio)|Red Dawn]]'', [[NASA]]'s first manned mission to Mars encounters a small band of surviving Ice Warriors who had been placed in suspended animation to defend the tomb of Izdaal, the greatest warrior of the Martian race. According to this story, previous unmanned Mars probes had brought back fragments of alien technology and DNA, and scientists had gone so far as to create human/Martian hybrid clones. This story, set in the 21st century, appears to depict the first full contact between humans and Ice Warriors. This is difficult to reconcile with ''The Dying Days'', and may support the idea that the novels and audios take place in separate [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]s.

Another audio play, ''[[Frozen Time]]'', sees the Seventh Doctor and a human expedition discovering a group of Ice Warriors frozen in the Antarctic. These are revealed to be criminals deliberately imprisoned there as punishment. Also, ''[[The Bride of Peladon]]'' saw the Fifth Doctor, [[Peri Brown|Peri]] and [[Erimem]] encountering an Ice Warrior on Peladon, the Ice Warrior investigating the recent death of his sister on Peladon, culminating in him sacrificing his life to trap the Osiran responsible for his sister's death.

The Ice Warriors made an appearance in the [[Bernice Summerfield]] audio ''[[The Dance of the Dead]]'', and the new gardener on the [[Irving Braxiatel|Braxiatel Collection]] is an Ice Warrior named Hass.

The Fifth Doctor meets the Ice Warriors yet again in the audio play ''[[The Judgement of Isskar]]''. This serves as a sort of [[origin story]] for them. The Doctor lands on Mars, looking for a segment of the Key to Time. At this point, Martians are a peaceful [[Commune (intentional community)|communal]] community who do not even know the meaning of the word "warrior". But, when the segment is taken away, the Martian atmosphere slowly erodes. They become desperate scavengers and, eventually, Ice Warriors.

In the 2010 [[Deimos and The Resurrection of Mars|''Deimos'' / ''The Resurrection of Mars'']], it is explained that many Ice Warriors went into [[cryogenic suspension]] after Mars was rendered inhospitable. Some of these vaults were on the Martian moon [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] and others were in the [[Asteroid Belt]]. Centuries later, some of these Ice Warriors were revived and eventually discovered a new home world. The planet was a beautiful, civilized utopia called Halcyon. The Ice Warriors killed all of the twenty billion inhabitants and renamed it New Mars.

In ''[[Lords of the Red Planet]]'', the Second Doctor encounters the Ice Warriors at an early point of their history. This, along with ''The Judgment of Isskar'', serves as an origin story for the Ice Warriors, with ''Lords'' essentially depicting their genetic origin while ''Judgement'' depicted their cultural growth. This story is from an unproduced script of Patrick Troughton's final season as the Doctor, re-created by Big Finish Productions. In this version of their origin, the Ice Warriors were the products of genetic engineering by the original inhabitants of Mars to act as a security force, augmenting a race of turtle-like creatures to serve the more lizard-esque Martians, but the research project that created the Ice Warriors was taken over by a psychopath who sought to create her own power base. Guided by the Doctor's example, her Ice Warriors are destroyed through the sacrifice of an early Ice Lord and a prototype Ice Warrior, with only a few examples of the species left alive, leaving it open whether the Ice Warriors depicted here will become the Ice Warrior culture witnessed in the show or if her creations will 'die out' and the familiar species will naturally evolve from the turtle-like creatures later.

In ''[[Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor Adventures]] Volume Two- Cold Vengeance'', the [[Tenth Doctor]] and [[Rose Tyler]] land on an asteroid that is being used as one of several freezer storage shops for the planet below, but learn that it was created from ice taken from another planet in this system, the other planet having previously been an Ice Warrior colony before the humans destroyed most of its population and forced the survivors to freeze themselves and hide. When a raid on the asteroid turns off the coolant system, a group of Ice Warriors hidden in the ice defrost enough to escape, attempting to crash the asteroid and another spaceship into the planet below in revenge for their past treatment, but the Doctor is able to destroy both asteroid and ship before they can crash. The last Ice Lord learns that some of his people survive on the colony below, living in the ghettos of the human city, but he attempts to destroy the Doctor with his suit's self-destruct systems rather than accept that his vengeance has been for nothing.

===Comics===
In the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip published in the ''Radio Times'' in 1996, an Ice Warrior named [[Ssard]] became a companion to the [[Eighth Doctor]], together with the human [[Stacy Townsend]]. Ssard's introductory strip dealt with a "medieval" period of Mars's history. Stacy and Ssard reappeared in the [[BBC Books]] novel ''Placebo Effect'' by Gary Russell, where the two were married. In the monthly ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who]]'' comic strips, an Ice Warrior named Harma is part of [[Abslom Daak|Abslom Daak's]] Dalek-killing band, the Star Tigers. Another ''Doctor Who Weekly'' back-up strip, ''Deathworld'' (#15 and #16), featured a conflict between the Ice Warriors and the Cybermen. In the story ''4-Dimensional Vistas'' (''Doctor Who Monthly'' #78-83), the [[Fifth Doctor]] and his new companion [[List of companions in Doctor Who spin-offs#G|Gus Goodman]] discover the Ice Warriors at an Arctic Base, allied with the [[Meddling Monk]] and planning to use a giant crystal to create a sonic cannon. The Seventh Doctor faced the Ice Warriors in the comic "A Cold Day in Hell" with Frobisher as the companion. The comic was printed in "Doctor Who Magazine"(130-133).

The Association was founded in the US in 1981, in order to study and provide information on the phenomena of the [[near death experience]] (NDE). Today it has grown into an international organization, which includes a network of more than 50 local interest groups,&lt;ref name="IANDS Brochure"/&gt; and approximately 850 members worldwide.&lt;ref name="K Upchurch 2012"/&gt; Local chapters, and support groups, are established in major U.S cities.&lt;ref name="Graves 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacDonald 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson 1999"&gt;Anderson, Jon.

In one of its publications the organization has formulated its vision as one of building "global understanding of near-death and near-death-like experiences through research, education, and support".&lt;ref name="IANDS Brochure"/&gt;

==History==

The organization was originally known as the ''Association for the Scientific Study of Near-Death Phenomena''. This group was founded by researchers [[John Audette]], [[Bruce Greyson]], [[Kenneth Ring]] and [[Michael Sabom]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="IANDS Fact Sheet"&gt;[http://iands.org/about/about-iands27/fact-sheet.html "IANDS Fact Sheet, as of December 2010'']. Accessed 2012-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ring 2000"&gt;Ring, Kenneth. Religious Wars in the NDE Movement: Some Personal Reflections on Michael Sabom's Light &amp; Death. ''Journal of Near-Death Studies'', 18(4) Summer 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greyson 2013"&gt;Greyson, Bruce. "An Overview of Near-Death Experiences". ''Missouri Medicine'', November/December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The first president of this association was John Audette, who later served as executive director.&lt;ref name="IANDS Fact Sheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ring 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 1982"&gt;New York Times Staff. "Connecticut Guide. Near-death Symposium". New York Times, April 25, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 the organization changed its name to the ''International Association for Near-Death Studies'' (also known as IANDS).&lt;ref name="IANDS Fact Sheet"/&gt; A headquarter was established in Connecticut, and was affiliated with the [[University of Connecticut]], Storrs.&lt;ref name="NYT 1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ziegler 1985"&gt;Ziegler, Jan. "Near-death Experiences Deemed Worthy Of Serious Research". ''The Chicago Tribune'', October 06, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 1986"&gt;New York Times Staff. "Near-Death Experiences Illuminate Dying Itself". ''New York Times'', October 28, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Offices were administered by Nancy Evans Bush,&lt;ref name="Bush 1991"&gt;Bush, Nancy Evans. Is Ten Years a Life Review? ''Journal of Near-Death Studies'', 10(1) Fall 1991&lt;/ref&gt; who later served as executive director.&lt;ref name="Ziegler 1985"/&gt;

Past presidents of IANDS also include researchers Kenneth Ring and Bruce Greyson, who served as Presidents in the early 1980s. The presidencies of Ring and Greyson (1981–83) marked the beginning of professional research on the topic of NDE's, leading up to the establishment of the ''[[Journal of Near-Death Studies]]'' in 1982.&lt;ref name="Griffith 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IANDS Fact Sheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 1982"/&gt; Greyson later served as director of research at IANDS.&lt;ref name="Genova 1988"&gt;Genova, Amy Sunshine. "Experiencing Near-death Promotes Better Life". ''The Sun Sentinel'', August 29, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; During the presidency of John Alexander, in 1984, the organization held its first research conference in Farmington (CT).&lt;ref name="IANDS Fact Sheet"/&gt;

Elizabeth Fenske took over the presidency from John Alexander in 1986, and was involved in the relocation of the main office to Philadelphia in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="IANDS Fact Sheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Detjen 1989"&gt;Detjen, Jim. "Near-death Experiences Deemed Worthy Of Study". ''The Chicago Tribune'', January 08, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the decade also marked a period of outreach for IANDS. Local branches were established in major U.S cities, and the first national IANDS conference was held at Rosemont College (PA) in 1989.&lt;ref name="Brody 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IANDS Fact Sheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Detjen 1989"/&gt; In the period from 1992-2008 IANDS-offices were administered by external service providers.&lt;ref name="IANDS Fact Sheet"/&gt;

In 2008, during the presidency of Diane Corcoran, the organization established its current headquarter in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. Later activity includes development of the IANDS website, and continued  maintenance of support groups and members.&lt;ref name="Beck 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacDonald 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K Upchurch 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IANDS Fact Sheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Upchurch 2012"&gt;Upchurch, Keith.

'''Isaac Hayne''' (23 September 1745 – 4 August 1781){{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1888}} was one of the most prominent Americans to be executed by the British during the [[American War of Independence]].&lt;ref name=Bowden&gt;[http://oldexchange.org/history/#1781 1781 Isaac Hayne], website of the [http://oldexchange.org Old Exchange Building and Provost Dungeon] cites Bowden, David K. The Execution of Isaac Hayne. Lexington, South Carolina: The Sandlapper Store, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
At the beginning of the War of Independence Hayne joined the rebellion, and was a commissioned a captain of artillery, and at the same time state senator. In 1780, on the invasion of the state by the British, he served in a cavalry regiment during the final siege of Charleston, and, being included in the capitulation of that place, was paroled on condition that he would not serve against the British while they held possession of the city.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1888}}

When in 1781 the fortunes of the British began to decline, he, with all the others who were paroled on the same terms, was required to join the royal army or be subjected to close confinement. Hayne would gladly have accepted imprisonment, but his wife and several of his children lay at the point of death from smallpox. He went to Charleston, and, being assured by the deputy British commandant, Patterson, that he would not be required to bear arms against his former compatriots, took the oath of allegiance. After the successes of General Greene had left the British nothing but Charleston, Hayne was summoned to join the royal army immediately. This being in violation of the agreement that had been made, he considered that this released him from all his obligations to the British. He went to the American camp, and was commissioned colonel of a militia company.{{sfn|Wilson|Fiske|1888}}

Hayne then commanded an American rebel raid which captured Brigadier-General [[Andrew Williamson (soldier)|Andrew Williamson]], an American Loyalist. Colonel [[Nisbet Balfour]], the British commander in Charleston during the 1781 [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War#Cornwallis takes command|siege of Charlestown]], fearing that Williamson would be hanged as a traitor, sent a column to intercept the raiding party. The interception was successful. There was a skirmish resulting in the defeat of the raiding party, the release of Williamson and the capture of Hayne.{{sfn|Moore|1860|pages=447–448}}

Hayne, although a prisoner of war, was sentenced to death by hanging by the British, because in the opinion of the British court martial, he had broken his earlier parole not to take up arms against [[the Crown]].&lt;ref name=Bowden/&gt; His sentence was carried out in Charleston on August 4, after which Hayne was buried on the family property in [[Jacksonboro, South Carolina|Jacksonboro]].

'''James Chapman''' (27 December 1831 [[Cape Town]] - 4 February 1872 [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]), was a South African explorer, hunter, trader and photographer.

A son of James Chapman and Elizabeth Greeff of [[Malmesbury, Western Cape|Malmesbury]] and brother to Henry Samuel Chapman, he was educated in Cape Town and left for [[Durban]] when 14 years old. He was appointed as chief clerk in the Native Affairs Department in 1848. A year later he settled in [[Potchefstroom]] where he became one of the first storekeepers. Shortly after, in 1852, he ventured across the [[Limpopo River]] and into [[Bamangwato]] country. He became friendly with Khama, one of the sons of Sekgoma, the Bamangwato chief, enlisting his aid in reaching the [[Chobe River]]. Early the following year found him on the [[Zambesi River]] which he explored to within {{convert|70|mi|km}} of the [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]], almost beating [[David Livingstone]] to their discovery.

By 1854 he had teamed up with Samuel H. Edwards, another explorer, and launched an expedition to [[Lake Ngami]] after which he trekked through the territory between Northern [[Bechuanaland]] and the Zambesi. An easygoing man, he was able to get on with the [[Bushmen|Bushman]] hunters of the semi-desert interior and spent long periods in their company, obtaining valuable help from them. Returning to Ngami, he travelled north to the [[Okavango River]], crossing [[Damaraland]] and reaching [[Walvis Bay]]. Here he busied himself with cattle-trading in Damaraland, before setting out on an expedition with his brother Henry and [[Thomas Baines]] and lasting from December 1860 to September 1864. Their aim was to explore the Zambesi from the Victoria Falls down to its delta, with a view to testing its navigability. However, these plans were bedevilled by sickness and misfortune. They did reach the Zambesi, but did not get to explore the mouth.  On 23 July 1862 they reached the Victoria Falls. It was on this expedition that Baines painted many of his famous scenes which were reproduced in an album of prints. His attempt at exploring the Zambesi ruined his health and exhausted his finances. He returned to Cape Town in 1864, dispirited and fever-stricken. The expedition was notable since it was the first time that a [[Stereo camera|stereoscopic camera]] had been used to record its progress. The size of the negatives was about 6 x 4.5&amp;nbsp;inches and of rather poor quality. Prints of these photographs are at the [[Africana Museum]] in [[Johannesburg]].

[[Sir George Grey]] commissioned him to capture live animals and to compile glossaries of the [[Bantu languages]]. Chapman kept diaries throughout his journeys, but his ''Travels in the Interior of South Africa'' appeared only in 1868, shortly before his death. Chapman travelled at times with [[Francis Galton]] and [[C.J. Andersson]]. He attempted to farm at Anawood on the banks of the [[Swakop]] river in 1863 and 1864, but was forced to abandon his holding due to the Nama-Ovaherero War, in which he refused to become involved. From 1864 until 1870 he lived at various places in South Africa, but returned as a trader and hunter to [[Hereroland]] and [[Ovamboland]] between 1870 and 1871. He died at Du Toit's Pan near Kimberley, on 4 February 1872, aged 40 years.

==Family==
In 1857 he married Catherine Cecelia Roome, daughter of Capt. William Roome, (master of the vessel "Olivia" on which Thomas Baines arrived at Cape Town on 23 November 1842) and Catherine Cecelia Bushnell (who was born in Virginia USA - her father, also a sea captain apparently settled in [[Nova Scotia]]). James and Catherine had four children.

One of their sons, William James Bushnell Chapman (1858–1932) became a trader, hunter and farmer. He came to [[Namibia]] as a child in 1864, spent ten years in Cape Town and returned on 16 June 1874 to Walvis Bay as assistant at Harrison's store. He traded and hunted in Ovamboland in 1875, then went to [[Angola]] in 1881 and farmed at Humpata [[:pt:Humpata]]. He finally resettled in 1928 with other Angola Boers in the [[Gobabis]] district of Namibia, where he died in October 1932.

Another son, Charles Henry Chapman, was born in Cape Town and boarded the [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]] at [[Southampton]] as a second class passenger (ticket number 248731, £13 10s). He carried with him the family bible belonging to his grandparents' family in Virginia and/or Nova Scotia; Chapman himself lived in The Bronx, NY. He died at age 52 of hypothermia and drowning after the sinking in the early hours of 15 April 1912; his body was later recovered by the [[Mackay-Bennett]].

Henry Samuel Chapman (1834–1922), brother of James Chapman, arrived at Walvis Bay by sea in February 1860 and travelled extensively as a hunter and trader between Walvis Bay, Ovamboland, Hereroland, Lake Ngami and the Cape until 1863. He later lived at Oudtshoorn, Kimberley and Johannesburg, and died in August 1922 at Braamfontein in South Africa.

Peter, ed. ''Members of the Wisconsin Legislature: 1848 – 1999''. State of Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau Informational Bulletin 99-1, September 1999; p. 22] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209014416/http://legis.state.wi.us/LRB/pubs/ib/99ib1.pdf |date=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Adam was born in [[Dienheim]], [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Darmstadt]], [[German Confederation]], on March 7, 1860; received a [[State school|common school]] in Germany and came to Wisconsin in 1874, and settled at Milwaukee, where he continued his education and resided. He became a brewer.

Adam had held no office until elected to the Assembly in 1886 from the 10th [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] Assembly district (the 10th [[wards of the United States|Ward]] of the City of Milwaukee) to succeed Republican [[Charles Elkert]] (who was not a candidate for re-election) for the session of 1887.

'''Lane Clyde Frost''' (October 12, 1963 &amp;ndash; July 30, 1989) was an American professional [[bull rider]] who is the 1987 World Champion of the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] (PRCA) and the 1990 [[ProRodeo Hall of Fame]] inductee. He is also known as the only rider to score qualified rides from the 1987 World Champion and 1990 ProRodeo Hall of Fame bull [[Red Rock (bull)|Red Rock]]. He died in the arena at the 1989 [[Cheyenne Frontier Days]] Rodeo as a result of injuries sustained when the bull Takin' Care of Business struck him after the ride.&lt;ref name="Schmoldt"&gt;{{cite web |title="Lasting Legacy: Lane Frost and the rodeo community |url=http://rodeo.trib.com/features/article_705267e4-6e93-11de-85ed-001cc4c03286.html |website=Casper Star-Tribune Online |accessdate=November 4, 2018 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090728050341/http://rodeo.trib.com/features/article_705267e4-6e93-11de-85ed-001cc4c03286.html |archivedate=July 28, 2009 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TWObit"&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/bull-rider-dies-after-being-gored/article_7e635668-4d89-536d-94fd-baf9e0853261.html "Bull rider dies after being gored"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', July 31, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; He died by getting rammed in the back with the bull's horn, breaking several of his ribs which severed an artery.

==Early life==
At the time of Lane's birth, his parents lived in [[Lapoint, Utah]]. However, his father, Clyde, was on the [[rodeo]] circuit as a [[saddle bronc and bareback rider]]. His mother, Elsie, went to stay with her parents in [[Kim, Colorado]], while she waited for him to arrive. He was born in the hospital in [[La Junta, Colorado|La Junta]], the closest medical facility to Kim. He had an older sister, Robin, and a younger brother, Cody.&lt;ref name="WranglerNet"&gt;{{cite web |title=Remembering Lane |url=http://wranglernetwork.com/news/remembering-lane/ |website=Wrangler Network |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Lane Frost {{!}} |url=https://lanefrost.com/pages/about |website=Lane Frost Brand |accessdate=November 4, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frost started riding [[dairy]] calves on the family dairy [[farm]] when he was five or six. When he was nine, he first got on a [[Cattle#Terminology|bull]]. However, to the relief of his family, he met [[Don Gay]] about that time; Gay told him that he should just ride calves and [[Cattle#Terminology|steers]] until his bones were more fully developed. Elsie says that she and Clyde had been telling him the same thing, but "Of course, he listened to Don."

At age fifteen, Frost started to ride bulls on a regular basis. Before that, he had been competing on calves and steers. His first rodeo awards were won in 1974, when he was 10, at the "Little Buckaroos" Rodeos held in [[Uintah Basin]]. He stayed on a bucking [[Shetland Pony]] to win first in bareback, took second in [[calf roping]], and rode a calf in the "bull riding" event to place third. While rodeoing was not the way of life his parents exactly wanted for him, they never discouraged him, and helped him whenever they could.

Frost spent his first fourteen years in Utah, doing chores on the family dairy farm, and later competing in various rodeo events. When he was in junior high (seventh and eighth grade) in [[Vernal, Utah|Vernal]], he excelled in [[wrestling]]. Although he never did so before entering junior high, as many of the other boys had done, because of his interest in rodeo, the coaches still had high expectations for him. He weighed only 75 pounds, but he won 45 matches, lost four times and had two ties.

Frost also continued competing in the [[Little Britches Rodeo]], and any other one he could enter, until his parents moved the family to [[Lane, Oklahoma]], in 1978 to escape the harsh Utah winters. He attended Atoka High School in [[Atoka, Oklahoma|Atoka]].&lt;ref name="TWObit"/&gt;

Frost was taught the art of riding by Clyde and his good friend, [[Freckles Brown]], who was a World Champion Bull Rider. In Oklahoma, he was the National High School Bull Riding Champion in 1981. He was the Bull Riding Champion of the first Youth National Finals in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], in 1982.

On January 5, 1985, Frost married Kellie Kyle (born 1965), a [[barrel racer]] from [[Quanah, Texas]], west of [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]].

==Professional career==
Frost joined the PRCA and began rodeoing full-time after graduating from high school in 1982. In 1987, he realized a lifelong dream when he became the PRCA World Champion Bull Rider at age 24. That same year, the great bull [[Red Rock (bull)|Red Rock]], owned by Growney Bros. Rodeo Company, was voted Bucking Bull of the Year. In 309 attempts, no one had ever ridden him, and in 1988, at the [[Challenge of the Champions]], Frost rode him in seven exhibition matches and was successful in four out of seven tries. He went on to compete at the Rodeo '88 Challenge Cup held as part of the [[Cultural Olympiad]] in association with the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/25/arts/stage-rodeo-88-at-olympic-festival.html|title=Stage: Rodeo '88 At Olympic Festival|last=Kisselgoff|first=Anna|date=February 25, 1988|work=New York Times|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenge of the Champions==
{{Main|Challenge of the Champions}}
Sometime in 1988, John Growney pondered a special competition between the two 1987 Champions.&lt;ref name="lanevsred"&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Bull Riders - Remembering Lane Frost vs. Red Rock|url=http://www.pbr.com/en/news/features/other-features/2011/3/remembering-lane-frost-vs-red-rock.aspx|website=Professional Bull Riders|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided that Frost and Red Rock would have seven showdowns at different rodeos in states across the West.&lt;ref name="lanevsred" /&gt; The event was titled the "Challenge of the Champions."&lt;ref name="lanevsred" /&gt; Red Rock was brought out of retirement and Frost finally rode him to the eight-second whistle for a scoring ride for 4 of the 7 matches.&lt;ref name="lanevsred" /&gt;

==Death==
On July 30, 1989, at the [[Cheyenne Frontier Days]] Rodeo in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], after completing a successful 85-point ride on a Brahma bull named Takin' Care of Business, Frost dismounted and landed in the dirt. The bull turned and hit him in the back with his horn (although he was not gored), breaking several of his [[ribs]].&lt;ref name="prorodeo"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.prorodeohalloffame.com/inductees/by-category/bull-riding/lane-frost/|title=Lane Frost - Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame|work=Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially rose to his feet, waving at [[Tuff Hedeman]] for help. As he took a couple of steps, he fell to the ground, causing his heart and lungs to be punctured by the broken ribs.&lt;ref name="frost1989"&gt;{{cite web |title=PRCA Rodeo Years 1988-1989 |url=http://www.lanefrost.com/prca-rodeo-years-1988-1989 |website=Lane Frost Web Site |publisher=www.lanefrost.com |accessdate=November 4, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125053258/http://www.lanefrost.com:80/biorodeoyears.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was rushed to Memorial Hospital. On the discovery that his heart injury was irreparable, the doctors pronounced him dead. No [[autopsy]] was performed. He posthumously finished third in the event. Takin' Care of Business went on to appear in the 1990 [[National Finals Rodeo]]. He was retired in the 1990s and put out to stud until he died in 1999.&lt;ref name="LVRJ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frost crafting his bull-riding resume in the footsteps of famous relative|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/rodeo/national-finals-rodeo/frost-crafting-his-bull-riding-resume-in-the-footsteps-of-famous-relative/|website=Las Vegas Review-Journal|accessdate=May 20, 2018|date=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lane Frost {{!}} Daily Dose Frost|url=http://dailydsports.com/lane-frost-2/|website=The Daily Dose|accessdate=May 20, 2018|date=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frost is buried near his hero and mentor, [[Freckles Brown]], at Mount Olivet Cemetery in [[Hugo, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/cowboy-s-funeral-draws-throng/article_5a8d2beb-5845-525e-8f94-95acb2390912.html "Cowboy's funeral draws throng"], [[Associated Press|AP]] in ''[[Tulsa World]]'', August 3, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After Frost's death, [[Cody Lambert]], who currently resides in [[Bowie, Texas]], one of his traveling partners, and a founder of the [[Professional Bull Riders]] (PBR), created the protective vest that all professional cowboys now must wear when riding bulls.&lt;ref name="Schmoldt"/&gt;
  
In 1994, the biopic based on Frost's life, ''[[8 Seconds]]'', was released. [[Luke Perry]] played the role of Frost. [[Stephen Baldwin]] was cast as Frost's best friend, [[Tuff Hedeman]].

The medical team for the PBR league is named after Frost, as is the Lane Frost/Brent Thurman Award, given for the highest scoring ride at the PBR World Finals.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary|url=http://www.pbr.com/en/education/dictionary.aspx|website=Professional Bull Riders|publisher=www.pbr.com|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lane Frost Health and Rehabilitation Center in Hugo is dedicated to his memory.

Country music star [[Garth Brooks]] paid tribute to Frost in the video for his 1990 hit single "[[The Dance (song)|The Dance]]". Rodeo announcer Randy Schmutz wrote the song "A Smile Like That" about him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane and Michael Stern]], [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1992/09/14/raging-bulls "Raging Bulls"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', September 14, 1992, p. 93 {{subscription required}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 song "Red Rock" by the [[Smokin' Armadillos]] is about him, and he is mentioned at the end of the video for [[Korn]]'s 2007 song "[[Hold On (Korn song)|Hold On]]".  [[Aaron Watson]]'s 2012 album, ''Real Good Time'', included the single "July in Cheyenne".&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Dauphin, [http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/5793247/aaron-watson-finds-inspiration-in-tragic-rodeo-star-lane-frost "Aaron Watson Finds Inspiration in Tragic Rodeo Star Lane Frost"], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', November 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1990, Frost was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. In 1999, he was named to the [[Professional Bull Riders: Heroes and Legends|PBR Heroes &amp; Legends Celebration]]: Ring of Honor, the [[Cheyenne Frontier Days Old West Museum|Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame]], the [[Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame]] in Fort Worth. In 2017, Lane was inducted into the [[Bull Riding Hall of Fame]].

Frost's parents have authorized ''Cowboy Bible: The Living New Testament'', with a sketch of him on the cover. They reside in [[Lane, Oklahoma]] and travel to many rodeos giving speeches in his memory. His widow, Kellie, is now married to Michael Edward Macy (born 1962), a former rodeo performer and rancher near [[Post, Texas]]. They have a son and daughter.

A documentary titled "The Challenge of the Champions: The Story of Lane Frost and Red Rock" premiered in 2008. It covers the match between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Documentary film examines Lane Frost's life |url=https://newsok.com/article/3314605/documentary-film-examines-lane-frosts-life |website=NewsOK.com |accessdate=November 4, 2018 |date=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, on the 25th anniversary of Frost's death, the ''[[Wyoming Tribune-Eagle]]'' published as part of its coverage of Cheyenne Frontier Days an article recalling the highlights of his career and his character. His friend, Cody Lambert, is quoted: "I'm a [[John Wayne]] fan, and I don't mean any disrespect to John Wayne, but he played the characters that Lane really was." Sage Kimzey, the champion bull rider from [[Strong City, Oklahoma]], said: "He's the guy every young bull rider wants to grow up and be like." Tuff Hedeman compared Frost's death to that of [[James Dean]]: "gone way too soon."&lt;ref name=istclair&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/lane-frost-his-legend-rides-on/article_3ffaa63a-8868-5a1f-9957-b0730cdca2ef.html|title=Lane Frost: His legend rides on|author=Ian St. Clair|date=July 19, 2014|newspaper=Wyoming Tribune-Eagle |accessdate=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After surviving an accident on the last lap of the 2015 [[Coke Zero 400]] at [[Daytona International Speedway]], [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] driver [[Austin Dillon]] waved to the crowd, with a similar gesture to that of Frost. He later said that it was in tribute to Frost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dillon's post-crash wave a tribute to late bull rider Lane Frost |url=https://www.foxsports.com/nascar/shake-and-bake/story/austin-dillon-daytona-crash-coke-zero-400-lane-frost-tribute-070615 |website=FOX Sports |accessdate=November 4, 2018 |date=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipidomics research involves the identification and quantification of the thousands of cellular lipid molecular species and their interactions with other lipids, proteins, and other metabolites. Investigators in lipidomics examine the structures, functions, interactions, and dynamics of cellular lipids and the changes that occur during perturbation of the system.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; first defined the field of lipidomics through integrating the specific chemical properties inherent in lipid molecular species with a comprehensive mass spectrometric approach. Although lipidomics is under the umbrella of the more general field of "metabolomics", lipidomics is itself a distinct discipline due to the uniqueness and functional specificity of lipids relative to other metabolites.

In lipidomic research, a vast amount of information quantitatively describing the spatial and temporal alterations in the content and composition of different lipid molecular species is accrued after perturbation of a cell through changes in its physiological or pathological state. Information obtained from these studies facilitates mechanistic insights into changes in cellular function. Therefore, lipidomic studies play an essential role in defining the biochemical mechanisms of lipid-related disease processes through identifying alterations in cellular lipid metabolism, trafficking and homeostasis. The growing attention on lipid research is also seen from the initiatives underway of the LIPID Metabolites And Pathways Strategy (LIPID MAPS Consortium).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lipidmaps.org LIPID MAPS Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; and The European Lipidomics Initiative (ELIfe).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lipidomics.net/ European Lipidomics Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structural diversity of lipids ==
[[Lipids]] are a diverse and ubiquitous group of compounds which have many key biological functions, such as acting as structural components of [[cell membrane]]s, serving as energy storage sources and participating in signaling pathways. Lipids may be broadly defined as [[hydrophobic]] or [[amphipathic]] small molecules that originate entirely or in part from two distinct types of biochemical subunits or "building blocks": [[ketoacyl]] and [[isoprene]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fahy E, Subramaniam S, Brown HA |title=A comprehensive classification system for lipids |journal=J. Lipid Res. |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=839–61 |year=2005 |pmid=15722563 |url=http://www.jlr.org/cgi/content/full/46/5/839 |doi=10.1194/jlr.E400004-JLR200 |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The
huge structural diversity found in lipids arises from the [[biosynthesis]] of various combinations of these building blocks. For example, glycerophospholipids are composed of a [[glycerol]] backbone linked to one of approximately 10 possible headgroups and also to 2 fatty [[acyl]]/[[alkyl]] chains, which in turn may have 30 or more different molecular structures. In practice, not all possible permutations are detected experimentally, due to chain preferences depending on the cell type and also to detection limits - nevertheless several hundred distinct glycerophospholipid molecular species have been detected in [[mammalian]] cells.

Plant '''chloroplast thylakoid''' membranes however, have ''unique lipid composition'' as they are deficient in phospholipids. Also, their largest constituent, ''monogalactosyl diglyceride or MGDG'', does not form aqueous bilayers. Nevertheless, dynamic studies reveal a normal lipid bilayer organisation in thylakoid membranes.&lt;ref&gt;YashRoy R.C.

=== Lipid extraction ===
Most methods of lipid extraction and isolation from biological samples exploit the high solubility of [[hydrocarbon|hydrocarbon chains]] in [[organic solvents]]. Given the diversity in lipid classes, it is not possible to accommodate all classes with a common extraction method. The traditional Bligh/Dyer procedure &lt;ref name="pmid13671378"&gt;{{cite journal

=== Lipid separation ===
The simplest method of lipid separation is the use of [[thin layer chromatography]] (TLC). Although not as sensitive as other methods of lipid detection, it offers a rapid and comprehensive screening tool prior to more sensitive and sophisticated techniques.
Solid-phase extraction (SPE) chromatography is useful for rapid, preparative separation of crude lipid mixtures into different lipid classes. This involves the use of prepacked columns containing [[silica]] or other stationary phases to separate [[glycerophospholipids]], [[fatty acids]], [[cholesteryl esters]], [[glycerolipids]], and [[sterols]] from crude lipid mixtures.&lt;ref name="pmid3973509"&gt;{{cite journal

[[High-performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC or LC) is extensively used in lipidomic analysis to separate lipids prior to mass analysis. Separation can be achieved by either normal-phase (NP) HPLC or reverse-phase (RP) HPLC. For example, NP-HPLC effectively separates glycerophospholipids on the basis of headgroup polarity,&lt;ref name="pmid15380713"&gt;{{cite journal

effectively separates fatty acids such as eicosanoids on the basis of chain length, degree of unsaturation and substitution.&lt;ref name="pmid9269087"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For global, untargeted lipidomic studies it is common to use both RP and NP or Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatrography (HILC) columns for increased coverage of lipidome. This can be further improved with ultra-performance (UPLC) columns (2.1&amp;nbsp;mm ID &amp; sub-2&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|micrometer]] particle size) or columns based on solid- core technology (2.1&amp;nbsp;mm ID &amp; 2.6&amp;nbsp;µm particle size). The UHPLC columns allow high resolution separation of complex lipids with increased peak capacity and sensitivity, whereas solid- core columns achieve same at shorter times on normal HPLC pumps. Chromatographic (HPLC/UHPLC) separation of lipids may either be performed offline or online where the eluate is integrated with the ionization source of a mass spectrometer.

=== Lipid detection ===
The progress of modern lipidomics has been greatly accelerated by the development of spectrometric methods in general and soft ionization techniques for [[mass spectrometry]] such as electrospray ionization (ESI),&lt;ref name="pmid12671038"/&gt; [[desorption electrospray ionization]] (DESI),&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2004|title=Mass Spectrometry Sampling Under Ambient Conditions with Desorption Electrospray Ionization|journal=Science|volume=306|issue=5695|pages=471–473|bibcode=2004Sci...306..471T|doi=10.1126/science.1104404|pmid=15486296|author=Z.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular. "Soft" ionization
does not cause extensive fragmentation, so that comprehensive detection of an entire range of lipids within a complex mixture can be correlated to experimental conditions or disease state.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depends on the formation of gaseous ions from polar, thermally labile and mostly non-volatile molecules and thus is completely suitable for a variety of lipids. It is a soft-ionization method that rarely disrupts the chemical nature of the analyte prior to mass analysis. Various ESI-MS methods have been developed for analysis of different classes, subclasses, and individual lipid species from biological extracts. Comprehensive reviews of the methods and their application have recently been published.&lt;ref name="pmid11712255"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major advantages of ESI-MS are high accuracy, sensitivity, reproducibility, and the applicability of the technique to complex solutions without prior derivatization.

==== [[Desorption electrospray ionization|DESI MS]] ====
DESI mass spectrometry is an ambient ionization technique developed by Professor Zoltan Takáts, et al., in Professor Graham Cooks' group from Purdue University.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; It combines the ESI and desorption ionization techniques,  by directing an electrically charged mist to the sample surface that is a few millimeters away.&lt;ref name="pmid16237663"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2005|title=Ambient mass spectrometry using desorption electrospray ionization (DESI): instrumentation, mechanisms and applications in forensics, chemistry, and biology|journal=Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS|volume=40|issue=10|pages=1261–75|doi=10.1002/jms.922|pmid=16237663|vauthors=Takáts Z, Wiseman JM, Cooks RG|bibcode=2005JMSp...40.1261T}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique has been successfully applied to lipidomics as imaging tool to map the lipid distributions within tissue specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ifa|first=Demian R.|last2=Wu|first2=Chunping|last3=Ouyang|first3=Zheng|last4=Cooks|first4=R.

==== [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization|MALDI MS]] ====
MALDI mass spectrometry is a laser-based soft-ionization method often used for analysis of large proteins, but has been used successfully for lipids. The lipid is mixed with a matrix, such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and applied to a sample holder as a small spot. A laser is fired at the spot, and the matrix absorbs the energy, which is then transferred to the analyte, resulting in ionization of the molecule. MALDI-Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS has become a very promising approach for lipidomics studies, particularly for the imaging of lipids from tissue slides.&lt;ref name="pmid17127263"&gt;{{cite journal

|last5=Zschornig
|last6=Arnold
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== APCI MS ====
The source for APCI is similar to ESI except that ions are formed by the interaction of the heated analyte solvent with a corona discharge needle set at a high electrical potential. Primary ions are formed immediately surrounding the needle, and these interact with the solvent to form secondary ions that ultimately ionize the sample. APCI is particularly useful for the analysis of nonpolar lipids such as triacylglycerols, sterols, and fatty acid esters.&lt;ref name="pmid17981531"&gt;{{cite journal

== Imaging techniques ==
The high sensitivity of DESI in the lipid range makes it a powerful technique for the detection and mapping of lipids abundances within tissue specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiseman|first=Justin M.|last2=Puolitaival|first2=Satu M.|last3=Takáts|first3=Zoltán|last4=Cooks|first4=R.

Abundant lipid-related ions are produced from the direct analysis of thin tissue slices when sequential spectra are acquired across a tissue surface that has been coated with a MALDI matrix. Collisional activation of the molecular ions can be used to determine the lipid family and often structurally define the molecular species. These techniques enable detection of phospholipids, sphingolipids and glycerolipids in tissues such as heart, kidney and brain. Furthermore, distribution of many different lipid molecular species often define anatomical regions within these tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calligaris|first=David|last2=Caragacianu|first2=Diana|last3=Liu|first3=Xiaohui|last4=Norton|first4=Isaiah|last5=Thompson|first5=Christopher J.|last6=Richardson|first6=Andrea L.|last7=Golshan|first7=Mehra|last8=Easterling|first8=Michael L.|last9=Santagata|first9=Sandro|date=2014-10-21|title=Application of desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging in breast cancer margin analysis|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/42/15184|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=111|issue=42|pages=15184–15189|doi=10.1073/pnas.1408129111|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4210338|pmid=25246570|bibcode=2014PNAS..11115184C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19050313"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of quantitative lipidomic data in conjunction with the corresponding transcriptional data (using gene-array methods) and proteomic data (using tandem MS) enables a systems biology approach to a more in-depth understanding of the metabolic or signaling pathways of interest.

== Informatics ==
A major challenge for lipidomics, in particular for MS-based approaches, lies in the computational and bioinformatic demands of handling the large amount of data that arise at various stages along the chain of information acquisition and processing.&lt;ref name="pmid21939287"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromatographic and MS data collection requires substantial efforts in spectral alignment and statistical evaluation of fluctuations in signal intensities. Such variations have a multitude of origins, including biological variations, sample handling and analytical accuracy. As a consequence several replicates are normally required for reliable determination of lipid levels in complex mixtures. Within the last few years, a number of software packages have been developed by various companies and research groups to analyze data generated by MS profiling of metabolites, including lipids. The data processing for differential profiling usually proceed through several stages, including input file manipulation, spectral filtering, peak detection, chromatographic alignment, normalization, visualization, and data export. An example of metabolic profiling software is the freely-available Java-based Mzmine application.&lt;ref name="pmid16403790"&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Lost Worlds, Vanished Lives''''' is a 1989 four-part [[BBC]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] series concerning the discovery of [[fossils]]. It is written and presented by [[David Attenborough]], produced by [[Mike Salisbury]], and was originally broadcast in April 1989. It was made in between the second and third instalments of Attenborough's "Life" series: ''[[The Living Planet]]'' and ''[[The Trials of Life]]'', respectively. The study of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s and their ancient secrets was something of a boyhood passion for David Attenborough. In these programmes, his enthusiasm for the subject is undiminished. With the help of expert [[palaeontologists]], fossil hunters and (for the time) modern [[animation]] techniques, Attenborough attempts to show how life evolved in [[Earth]]'s distant past. To do so, he travels the globe to visit the world's most famous fossil sites.

== Release ==
[[2 Entertain]] published the series on DVD (catalog number BBCDVD1466) on 27 September 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4748">'''Maurice Clenock''' ({{aka}} Maurice Clenocke, Maurice Clennock; [[Cymraeg|in Welsh]]: ''Morus Clynog'', ''Morys Clynog'', ''Morus Clynnog'', ''Morys Clynnog'') was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] Roman Catholic priest and [[recusant]] exile. He was the first head of the [[English College, Rome]]. He was born at [[Llŷn]] or [[Eifionydd]] (present-day [[Gwynedd]]) circa 1525 and died at sea in 1581.

==Life==
He was educated at the [[University of Oxford]], where he was admitted Bachelor of Canon Law in 1548. During the reign of [[Mary I of England]] he became almoner and secretary to [[Cardinal Pole]], prebendary of York, rector of [[Orpington]] (Kent), and dean of [[Shoreham, Kent|Shoreham]] and [[Croydon]], and chancellor of the prerogative court of Canterbury. 

In 1556 he was made rector of [[Corwen]] in the [[Diocese of St. Asaph]], and on the death of the [[Bishop of Bangor]] in 1558 was nominated to the vacant see, but was never consecrated, owing to the change of religion under [[Elizabeth I of England]]. Surrendering all his preferments, he accompanied [[Thomas Goldwell]], [[Bishop of St. Asaph]], to Rome, where they resided in the English hospital, of which Clenock was ''camerarius'' in 1567. In 1578 he was made its warden. At the same time [[Pope Gregory XIII]] ordered the hospital to be converted into a college, until England should return to the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Clenocke, Maurice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The warden was made the first rector of the college by the pope; but [[William Allen (cardinal)|Cardinal Allen]] judged him unfit, though he described him as "an honest and friendly man and a great advancer of the students' and seminaries' cause" (Letter to [[Owen Lewis (bishop)|Owen Lewis]], 12 May 1579). Despite his personal good qualities he did not prove a competent ruler. He was accused of unduly favouring his fellow-countrymen at the expense of the English students, who numbered thirty-three as against seven Welsh students.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Allen wrote, "Mischief and murder had like to have been committed in ipso collegio" (letter cited above). The students, having unsuccessfully appealed to the pope, left the college, and finally the pope, in April, 1579, appointed Father [[Alfonso Agazzari]], S. J., rector, leaving Dr. Clenock still warden of the hospital.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

He retired, however, in 1580 to [[Rouen]], where he took ship for Spain, but was lost at sea, drowned early in 1581 on a sea voyage to Spain. In contemporary documents he is frequently referred to as "Dr. Morrice".

The '''Mercedes-Benz Bionic''' was a [[concept car]] created by [[DaimlerChrysler AG]] under the [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] Group. It was first introduced in 2005 at the DaimlerChrysler Innovation Symposium in [[Washington, D. C.]] The Bionic was modeled after a type of [[fish]], the [[yellow boxfish]], ''Ostracion cubicus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Bionic" Car Fueled by Fishy Ideas|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2005/06/0615_050615_fishcar.html|work=National Geographic|accessdate=18 October 2013|date=15 June 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019205924/http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2005/06/0615_050615_fishcar.html|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also has 80% lower [[nitrogen]] [[nitrogen oxide|oxide]] emissions with its [[selective catalytic reduction]] technology.

==Engine and performance==
The Bionic is powered by a 103&amp;nbsp;kW direct-injection [[diesel engine]] that gives out around 70 [[Miles per gallon|MPG (US)]] (~3.36 L/100&amp;nbsp;km). This engine also gives out around a total of {{convert|140|hp||0|abbr=on}} and a little over {{convert|221|ft·lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at around 1600 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]. The Bionic can go from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in about 8 seconds and has a top speed of a little over {{convert|190|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} .

==Design==
The exterior design was modeled after the yellow boxfish (''[[Ostracion cubicus]]''), a marine fish that lives in coral reefs. Mercedes-Benz decided to model the Bionic after this fish due to the supposed low [[coefficient of drag]] of its body shape and the rigidity of its [[exoskeleton]]; this influenced the car's unusual looks. Other parts of the design include the fact that the rear wheels are partially fitted with plastic and that it's considered as a lightweight vehicle. Mercedes-Benz reported a [[drag coefficient]] of 0.19;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/03/08/cars.fish.popsci/index.html Mercedes' fish-inspired car] CNN (retrieved 2008-08-12)&lt;/ref&gt; for comparison, the production vehicle with the lowest ever C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; value was the [[GM EV1]], at 0.195. While the Bionic had a much larger internal volume than the EV1, the Bionic's larger frontal area made the EV1 more aerodynamic overall, as drag is a product of the area and the drag coefficient.

The '''Murder of June Anne Devaney''' was the murder of a girl aged 3 years 11 months which occurred on 15 May 1948 in which June Anne Devaney was abducted from her cot while an [[inpatient]] at [[Queen's Park Hospital]] in [[Blackburn, Lancashire]]. She was removed to the grounds of the hospital, where she was [[rape]]d, before suffering extensive [[blunt force trauma]] to her skull by enduring her head being repeatedly swung into a sandstone wall. This assault caused the child to suffer extensive internal injuries and multiple [[skull fracture]]s, causing June Anne to develop a fatal state of [[acute stress reaction|shock]]. Her murderer, 22-year-old Peter Griffiths, was arrested three months after the crime. He was subsequently tried and convicted of June Anne's murder and was [[hanging|hanged]] on 19 November 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

To solve the crime, police obtained the [[fingerprints]] of every male aged 16 and over who had been in the vicinity of Blackburn on the night of the murder to obtain the fingerprints of the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/foi-june2006.pdf |title=Freedom of Information: Records released as a result of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests|work= The National Archives|publisher= HM Government of the United Kingdom |format=PDF |date= June 2005|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation into the murder of June Anne Devaney would prove to be a milestone in the history of [[forensic science]]; this being the first time a mass [[fingerprinting]] exercise had been implemented to solve a murder in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpsociety.org.uk/news/JAD.html|title=The Fingerprint Society commemorates 60 years since landmark fingerprint identification|publisher=The Fingerprint Society|work=Fpsociety.org.uk|year=2008|accessdate=27 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306164019/http://www.fpsociety.org.uk/news/JAD.html|archivedate=6 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sixty years of fingerprints|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7573433.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 September 2012|format=Video|date=20 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mentalfloss.com/article/70263/history-first-mass-fingerprinting-operation ''mentalfloss.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
June Anne Devaney had been admitted to the [[East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust|Queen's Park Hospital]] in [[Blackburn, Lancashire]] on 5 May 1948, to recover from a mild bout of [[pneumonia]]. She was placed in ward CH3 of the premises.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspaperarchive.com/avalanche-journal-may-16-1948-p-1/ ''Avalanche Journal May 16, 1948'' p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after midnight on 15 May, nurse Gwendolyn Humphreys (who was in the ward's kitchen) heard a child's cry coming from the ward. She checked the ward, soothed the child and returned him to his cot, noting as she did so the child in the adjacent cot——June Anne Devaney —was sound asleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then returned to her duties. At 1:20&amp;nbsp;am, she felt a draught and noticed an open door at the end of the ward. She closed it, and saw both that June Anne's cot was empty, and adult footprints—made by stockinged feet—were visible upon the highly waxed floor. Ominously, the drop side of the cot was still in place, meaning the child had to have been lifted from her cot.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Nurse Humphreys made a quick search of the ward, desperately attempting to find June Anne. After 30 minutes of fruitless searching, she contacted the local police. They arrived at 1:55&amp;nbsp;am and fully searched the hospital and its grounds, finding the child's body at 3:17&amp;nbsp;am. Her body lay face down in the grass alongside an {{convert|8|ft}} tall sandstone boundary wall some {{convert|300|ft|m}} from the ward,{{refn|group=n|The site where Devaney's body was discovered is now covered by the patients' car park of the [[East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust|Royal Blackburn Teaching Hospital]]}} and immediately apparent were extensive bloodstains and tearing to her nightdress, numerous [[skull fracture]]s, and blood exuding from her nostrils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basd.k12.wi.us/faculty/teverson/CASESTUDY--PETERGRIFFITHS.pdf ''Case Study: Peter Griffiths'']&lt;/ref&gt; The area where her body was discovered was promptly cordoned off, and at 4:20 a.m., the [[Chief Constable]] of Blackburn Police contacted [[Scotland Yard]], seeking the assistance of an experienced investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the child's body bore extensive injuries consistent with bludgeoning, the hospital became a crime scene, and the ward was secured and searched. A subsequent [[post mortem]] revealed that June Anne had died of [[acute stress reaction|shock]] due to both extensive internal injuries and multiple skull fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internal injuries were consistent with the child having been raped,&lt;ref&gt;''The Casebook of Forensic Detection: How Science Solved 100 of the World's Most Baffling Crimes'' p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; and the multiple, extensive fractures and [[blunt force trauma]] to her skull had been inflicted from the child being repeatedly swung into the boundary wall while her rapist and murderer had held her by her legs, ankles, or feet.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Numerous teeth marks were also notable on her left buttock, and puncture wounds were found on one ankle. Considering the area where the body was discovered, plus soon being contacted by a taxi driver who informed police that he had picked up a man with a [[Lancashire dialect and accent|local accent]] close to the hospital on the night of the crime, Blackburn Police came to believe early in the investigation that the crime would very likely have been committed by a local person, or an individual with extensive local geographical knowledge.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;

Beside Devaney's cot, a glass 1946 [[Boston round (bottle)|Winchester bottle]], partially filled with [[Water for injection|sterile water]], was found alongside further soiled footprints which were clearly visible on the highly polished hospital floor;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/a-brutal-murder-begins-an-unusual-investigation |title=A brutal murder begins an unusual investigation |publisher=History.com |work=This Day in History — 5/14/1948 |date= |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cotton"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?pageid=5144&amp;language=eng|title= The Murder of June Anne Devaney|publisher= |work= Cottontown.org|first= Lorna|last= Woodruff|date= |accessdate= 27 September 2012|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120404071143/http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?language=eng&amp;pageID=5144|archivedate= 4 April 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, the pattern of these stockinged feet impressions evident throughout the ward revealed that June Anne's abductor and murderer had evidently removed his shoes after entering the premises before prowling throughout the ward to view each cot and bed before selecting June Anne's cot as the one from which he chose to abduct his victim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basd.k12.wi.us/faculty/teverson/CASESTUDY--PETERGRIFFITHS.pdf ''Case Study: Peter Griffiths'']&lt;/ref&gt; The bottle itself had inexplicably been removed from its customary place (a trolley at the end of the ward) and placed beside the child's cot. This bottle itself was examined for fingerprints, being found to contain several sets.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
After all hospital staff had their fingerprints compared against those upon the bottle,{{refn|group=n|Initial comparison had begun with all persons with general access to the hospital itself—2,017 persons in all. Of these persons, 642 had specific access to the children's ward. All were checked, and all were eliminated from the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;''The Casebook of Forensic Detection: How Science Solved 100 of the World's Most Baffling Crimes'' p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;}} a team of detectives from the [[Lancashire Constabulary]] traced all individuals who could have had a legitimate reason to have been in the ward within two years prior to the murder for the purposes of both [[alibi]] tracing, and fingerprint comparison, before all were eliminated as suspects. Following the completion of this exhaustive task, one unidentified set of fingerprints remained. This set of fingerprints was declared by the head of the Lancashire Fingerprint Bureau to have belonged to the child's murderer.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide'' p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

After first establishing that no match for this set of fingerprints could be found within the police fingerprint bureau—meaning the perpetrator had not previously been convicted of any crime—attention turned to every male at or over the age of 16 within the local community. In a joint effort between local police forces and senior detectives from Scotland Yard, the [[Chief Inspector#United Kingdom|Detective Chief Inspector]] in charge of the investigation, DCI John Capstick, then proposed that every male at or over the age of 16 who lived or was in the vicinity of Blackburn (then a town of 123,000 inhabitants) between 14 and 15 May be fingerprinted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public were asked to cooperate with police throughout this undertaking, with the promise that all records obtained would not be compared for usage in other cases, and that these records would be destroyed at the completion of this task.{{refn|group=n|All records obtained were destroyed just weeks prior to the execution of the perpetrator of the crime. They would be destroyed in a mass [[Pulp (paper)|pulping]] exercise at a local [[papermill]], with the local press present to record the destruction of the records.&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;}}

The mass operation began, and a special card was developed so that the identifiable sections of the perpetrator's left hand found upon the bottle (the left [[forefinger]], [[middle finger]], [[ring finger]] and a section of the left palm) could be recorded swiftly. The card also recorded the individual's name, address, and [[National Identity Registration Number]]. Also on the card was a section pertaining to the individual's movements between 11 p.m. on 14 May and 2 a.m. 15 May.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.nhs.uk/services/1939-register-service |title=1939 Register Service |publisher=NHS Information Centre |date= |accessdate=4 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109164823/http://www.ic.nhs.uk/services/1939-register-service |archivedate=9 November 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The task-force to carry out this endeavour was led by Inspector W. Barton and comprised a team of 20 officers who, armed with details from the [[Electoral Register]], set about the districts collecting fingerprints and comparing them against those upon the Winchester bottle. Over the course of two months, over 40,000 sets of prints were taken from more than 35,000 homes without a match being found.{{refn|group=n|Such was the level of public outrage generated by the murder of June Anne Devaney, that throughout the duration of this mammoth task, only very seldom did officers encounter a refusal by a member of the public to submit his fingerprints for comparison with those upon the Winchester bottle. On the rare instance a member of the public did refuse to give his fingerprints, this individual was visited by a senior police officer, who in each instance, succeeded in obtaining the individual's fingerprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Upon completion of this exercise in late July, police then concentrated on people who had not been listed upon the Electoral Register. By way of checking the issue of [[Rationing|ration books]] and the Registration Number of the individual by which they and their owners were identified, officers began tracing all male individuals whose fingerprints had not yet been collected.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison===
One of the Blackburn addresses to be checked on 11 August was that of Peter Griffiths, a 22-year-old ex-serviceman who lived in Briley Street, and who worked as a packer on the night shift at a local flour mill. When asked to provide his fingerprints for comparison, Griffiths—whose niece had been in Queen's Park Hospital at the time June Anne had been abducted&lt;ref&gt;''The Casebook of Forensic Detection: How Science Solved 100 of the World's Most Baffling Crimes'' p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;—supplied them without hesitation.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; At 3:00 p.m. on 12 August, a comparison for the fingerprints upon the Winchester bottle was made with the fingerprints obtained from Peter Griffiths.&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;

By the time this comparison had been made, officers had taken 46,253 sets of fingerprints, and had less than 200 sets of prints left to check before the completion of their task.

==Arrest==
Peter Griffiths was arrested by DCI Capstick as he left his Blackburn home to attend work on the evening of 12 August.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken to Blackburn Police Headquarters, where he was formally [[Police caution|cautioned]] as to his right to silence. During the ride to police headquarters, and throughout his first interview, Griffiths attempted to deny any involvement,&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; although when confronted with the fact his fingerprints had been a perfect match for those upon the bottle, he turned towards DCI Capstick and stated: "Well, if they are my fingerprints on the bottle, I'll tell you all about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confession===
In the statement he subsequently gave to detectives, Griffiths claimed that on the night of the 14th, he had chosen to go for a night's "drinking alone" in Blackburn, and that as a result of his heavy drinking, by [[Last call (bar term)|closing time]], he had become severely [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]].{{refn|group=n|Griffiths claimed to have drank at least 11 pints of [[Bitter (beer)|bitter]], two double [[Shot glass|shots]] of rum,&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; and one pint of [[Guinness]] on the night he killed June Anne Devaney.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;}} He had then chosen to walk around in an attempt to "[[Sobriety|sober up]]" before returning home. Griffiths then claimed to have spoken with a man in a parked car, whom he had asked to light his (Griffiths') cigarette. According to Griffiths, this man, noting his state of intoxication, had said to him: "Get in, open the window and I'll give you a spin."&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; This man had soon parked his car in close proximity to Queen's Park Hospital, and it had been at this stage at which Griffiths had chosen to break into the premises to commit his crime.{{refn|group=n|This claim to have been offered a lift by an unknown stranger in a car was called into question by a taxi driver who informed investigators that on the night of the murder, he had given a lift to a man matching Griffith's description, who had specifically requested to be driven to a quarry located adjacent to the Queen's Park Hospital. This taxi driver's account, if correct, suggests the murder of June Anne was [[premeditation|premeditated]] from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;''Real-Life Crimes'' (1993) ISSN 9-771354-950013&lt;/ref&gt;}} He had, he stated, picked up the Winchester bottle to use as a weapon in the event any member of staff had attempted to challenge him after he had entered the premises, before he had chosen June Anne as his victim.

Griffiths refused to talk in much detail as to the atrocities he inflicted upon the child, beyond claiming that he had killed June Anne in a fit of rage when she had begun crying after he had carried her from the premises. Nonetheless, in one section of his statement, Griffiths stated that as he had carried the child across the field to where he assaulted and murdered her, June Anne had trustingly placed her arms around his neck. Although he showed no remorse for his actions (which he blamed upon his state of intoxication) throughout the course of his confession, he did end his formal statement with a sentence indicating he wished to be [[hanging|hanged]] for his crime: "I hope I get what I deserve."&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' pp. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 13 August, Peter Griffiths was formally charged with the murder of June Anne Devaney.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond providing investigators with a further set of his fingerprints and foot impressions for additional comparison with those upon the Winchester bottle and upon the floor of the ward of the Queen's Park Hospital, he would refuse to cooperate with all subsequent requests either to discuss aspects of his crime, or to provide blood or pubic hair samples for additional comparison with samples obtained at the crime scene prior to his upcoming trial; simply making statements to the effect of, "I don't wish to say anything" when these requests were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Griffiths' confession, he was immediately [[remand (court procedure)|remanded into custody]] at [[HM Prison Liverpool|Walton Gaol]] to await trial.

To both substantiate Griffiths' confession, and to garner further evidence, investigators went to his house to conduct a thorough search. During this search, a ticket was found from a local [[pawnbroker]], dated 31 May 1948, for a suit belonging to Griffiths. Police collected this suit, only for the police forensics laboratory to discover that it bore bloodstains in several locations on both the jacket and trousers. These bloodstains were found to be the same blood type of June Anne Devaney—[[ABO blood group system|type A]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, fibres from this suit proved to be a perfect match to fibres found upon the child's body, clothing, and the window ledge where her murderer had entered the hospital,&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; thus proving this to have been the suit Griffiths had been wearing on the night of the crime.

==Trial==
The trial of Peter Griffiths began on 15 October 1948. He was tried before Mr. Justice Oliver at the [[assizes|assize court]] of [[Lancaster Castle|Lancaster]],&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt; and chose to enter a formal plea of [[plea|not guilty]] to the charge of murder on this date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=teMXBjbp_boC&amp;pg=PP64&amp;lpg=PP64&amp;dq=june+anne+devaney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mj5b76B9e&amp;sig=PLUglmu6sd0arA_gGClFynOmgyo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim6o6Qvu7UAhUqLcAKHTi1D4Q4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=june%20anne%20devaney&amp;f=false| title= Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Bulletin| date= 18 March 1949| author= Carl Mulvey| accessdate= 9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those to testify on behalf of the prosecution was Inspector Colin Campbell, who testified as to the prints on the Winchester bottle being a precise match for the samples Griffiths had twice provided for investigators, and which he readily acknowledged were his own. To demonstrate this, enlarged copies of both sets of fingerprints were displayed to the jury, with Inspector Campbell indicating 16 ridge characteristics which were in agreement on both sets of impressions. Inspector Campbell also testified as to the stockinged feet impressions Griffiths had provided for investigators also being remarkably similar in characteristics with those found upon the ward from which June Anne had been abducted. Also to testify on behalf of the prosecution were individuals who described how the suit Griffiths had pawned shortly after the murder was found to be heavily bloodstained in several locations on both the jacket and trousers, and that these bloodstains were of the same blood type of June Anne Devaney. The jurors were told how fibres from this suit were of a perfect match to fibres found on the child's clothing, body, and on the window ledge where her murderer had evidently entered the hospital. None of these experts were [[cross-examination|cross-examined]] by Griffiths' defence counsel.

During the trial, Griffiths' defence counsel openly stated they were not fighting for his freedom, but for his life (murder being a [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital offence]] in the United Kingdom at the time). As Griffiths had already pleaded guilty to the offence,&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; all that remained was a question of his sanity, and as such, the defence had entered a plea of [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]]. This opinion was voiced by Dr. Alaistair Robertson Grant, who stated for the defence that Griffiths was displaying the early signs of [[schizophrenia]] (a condition for which he had treated Griffiths' father some thirty years previously when he had been hospitalised with the condition). Dr. Grant stated to the jury that although Griffiths knew what he was doing, he did not realise the criminality of his actions. To refute this testimony, the prosecution produced the medical officer from Walton Gaol, a Dr. F.H. Brisby. Dr. Brisby testified on 18 October as to his observations of Griffiths while he had been held on [[remand (detention)|remand]] since 14 August. He stated that, based on his observations of Griffiths throughout his incarceration, Griffiths was sane when he had committed the crime.&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;

During the trial, Griffiths described how he had entered the hospital while intoxicated, and had then picked up the Winchester sterile water bottle, which he stated to the Court he had intended to use as a weapon if he was challenged. He also described how he had lifted June Anne Devaney from her cot and then carried her, in his right arm, out of the hospital, down the field to where he had proceeded to beat and rape her, adding that the child had trustingly placed her arms around his neck as he had carried her to this destination. Although he confessed to having swung the child's head into the boundary wall approximately four times, Griffiths made no response when he was specifically asked about the sexual aspect of the assault. (After hearing Griffiths' recollection of the events, Dr. Alaistair Grant privately conceded that Griffiths was of [[Sanity|sound mind]].&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;)

The trial lasted for two days. Following [[closing argument]]s delivered by both counsels, the jury retired to consider their verdict, although they would deliberate for just 23 minutes&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle of 20th Century Murder'' p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; before announcing they had reached their verdict.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Guide to Great Britain'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Griffiths was found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] of June Anne Devaney's murder. In response to this verdict, Mr. Justice Oliver donned his formal [[black cap]] and made the following speech:

{{cquote|Peter Griffiths, this jury has found you guilty of a crime of the most brutal ferocity. I entirely agree with their verdict. The sentence of the Court is that you be taken from this place to a lawful prison and thence to a place of execution, and that you there suffer death by hanging [...] and may the Lord have mercy on your soul.&lt;ref name="cotton"/&gt;}}

Peter Griffiths did not lodge an appeal against his conviction. He was hanged at [[HM Prison Liverpool|Liverpool Prison]] on 19 November 1948. His body was later buried within the confines of the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishexecutions.co.uk/execution-content.php?key=751 |title=Peter Griffiths - 1948 |publisher=BritishExecutions.co.uk |date=19 November 1948 |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''diagnosis of myocardial infarction''' is created by integrating the history of the presenting illness and physical examination with [[electrocardiogram]] findings and [[cardiac marker]]s ([[blood test]]s for [[Cardiac muscle|heart muscle]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] damage).&lt;ref name="Mallinson 2010 15"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mallinson | first=T | title=Myocardial Infarction | journal=Focus on First Aid | volume= | issue=15 | pages=15 | date=2010 | pmid= | url=http://www.focusonfirstaid.co.uk/Magazine/issue15/index.aspx | accessdate=2010-06-08 | doi= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521050422/http://www.focusonfirstaid.co.uk/Magazine/issue15/index.aspx | archivedate=2010-05-21 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GPnotebook_MI&gt;[http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=892665874&amp;linkID=23278&amp;cook=yes Myocardial infarction: diagnosis and investigations] - [[GPnotebook]], retrieved November 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Coronary catheterization|coronary angiogram]] allows visualization of narrowings or obstructions on the heart vessels, and therapeutic measures can follow immediately.

A [[chest radiograph]] and routine blood tests may indicate complications or precipitating causes and are often performed upon arrival to an [[emergency department]]. New regional wall motion abnormalities on an [[Medical ultrasonography|echocardiogram]] are also suggestive of a myocardial infarction. Echo may be performed in equivocal cases by the on-call cardiologist.&lt;ref name=eMedicineEMERG&gt;''DE Fenton et al.''

==Diagnostic criteria==
According to the WHO criteria as revised in 2000,&lt;ref name="Alpert-2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alpert JS, Thygesen K, Antman E, Bassand JP | title=Myocardial infarction redefined--a consensus document of The Joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology Committee for the redefinition of myocardial infarction | journal=J Am Coll Cardiol | year=2000 | volume=36 | issue=3 | pages=959–69 | pmid=10987628 | doi=10.1016/S0735-1097(00)00804-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a cardiac [[troponin]] rise accompanied by either typical symptoms, pathological Q waves, ST elevation or depression or coronary intervention are diagnostic of MI.

Previous WHO criteria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anonymous |title=Nomenclature and criteria for diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. Report of the Joint International Society and Federation of Cardiology/World Health Organization task force on standardization of clinical nomenclature |journal=Circulation |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=607–9 |date=March 1979 |pmid=761341 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.59.3.607}}&lt;/ref&gt; formulated in 1979 put less emphasis on cardiac biomarkers; according to these, a patient is diagnosed with myocardial infarction if two (probable) or three (definite) of the following criteria are satisfied:
# Clinical history of ischaemic type chest pain lasting for more than 20 minutes
# Changes in serial ECG tracings
# Rise and fall of serum cardiac biomarkers such as [[creatine kinase]]-MB fraction and [[troponin]]

==Physical examination==

The general appearance of patients may vary according to the experienced symptoms; the patient may be comfortable, or restless and in severe distress with an increased [[respiratory rate]]. A cool and [[pallor|pale skin]] is common and points to [[vasoconstriction]]. Some patients have low-grade fever (38–39&amp;nbsp;°C). [[Blood pressure]] may be elevated or decreased, and the [[pulse]] can become [[Cardiac arrhythmia|irregular]].&lt;ref name=emedicine&gt;S. Garas ''et al.''. [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic1567.htm Myocardial Infarction]. [[eMedicine]]. Retrieved November 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harrisons-p1444&gt;Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Longo DL, Jameson JL. ''Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine''. p. 1444. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005. {{ISBN|0-07-139140-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If heart failure ensues, elevated [[jugular venous pressure]] and [[hepatojugular reflux]], or swelling of the legs due to peripheral [[edema]] may be found on inspection. Rarely, a cardiac bulge with a pace different from the pulse rhythm can be felt on [[precordial examination]]. Various abnormalities can be found on [[auscultation]], such as a third and fourth [[heart sounds|heart sound]], [[Heart murmur|systolic murmurs]], paradoxical splitting of the second heart sound, a [[Pericardium|pericardial]] friction rub and [[rales]] over the lung.&lt;ref name=emedicine/&gt;&lt;ref name=harrisons-p1450&gt;Kasper DL, ''et al.'' ''Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine''. p. 1450.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electrocardiogram==

{{Main|Electrocardiography in myocardial infarction}}
[[Image:12 Lead EKG ST Elevation tracing color coded.jpg|thumb|12-lead [[electrocardiogram]] showing ST-segment elevation (orange) in I, aVL and V1-V5 with reciprocal changes (blue) in the inferior leads, indicative of an anterior wall myocardial infarction.]]

The primary purpose of the [[electrocardiogram]] is to detect [[ischemia]] or acute coronary injury in broad, symptomatic [[emergency department]] populations. A serial ECG may be used to follow rapid changes in time. The standard 12 lead ECG does not directly examine the [[right ventricle]], and is relatively poor at examining the posterior basal and lateral walls of the [[left ventricle]]. In particular, acute myocardial infarction in the distribution of the circumflex artery is likely to produce a nondiagnostic ECG.&lt;ref name=Cannon_175&gt;Cannon CP at al. ''Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes''. p. 175. New Jersey: Humana Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-89603-552-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of additional ECG leads like right-sided leads V3R and V4R and posterior leads V7, V8, and V9 may improve sensitivity for right ventricular and posterior myocardial infarction.

The 12 lead ECG is used to classify patients into one of three groups:&lt;ref name="ECC_2005_ACS"&gt;{{cite journal | title=2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care&amp;nbsp;— Part 8: Stabilization of the Patient With Acute Coronary Syndromes | journal=Circulation | year=2005 | volume=112 | pages=IV–89–IV–110 | doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.166561 | pmid=16314375 | url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/112/24_suppl/IV-89}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# those with [[ST segment elevation]] or new [[bundle branch block]] (suspicious for acute injury and a possible candidate for acute reperfusion therapy with [[thrombolysis|thrombolytics]] or primary [[percutaneous coronary intervention|PCI]]),
# those with ST segment depression or T wave inversion (suspicious for ischemia), and

==Cardiac markers==

{{Main|Cardiac marker}}

Cardiac markers or cardiac enzymes are proteins that leak out of injured myocardial cells through their damaged cell membranes into the bloodstream. Until the 1980s, the enzymes [[Aspartate transaminase|SGOT]] and [[lactate dehydrogenase|LDH]] were used to assess cardiac injury. Now, the markers most widely used in detection of MI are ''MB'' subtype of the enzyme [[creatine kinase]] and cardiac [[troponin]]s T and I as they are more specific for myocardial injury. The cardiac troponins T and I which are released within 4–6 hours of an attack of MI and remain elevated for up to 2 weeks, have nearly complete tissue specificity and are now the preferred markers for assessing myocardial damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eisenman A | title = Troponin assays for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome: where do we stand? | journal = Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 509–14 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16918269 | doi = 10.1586/14779072.4.4.509}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Heart-type fatty acid binding protein]] is another marker, used in some home test kits.
Elevated troponins in the setting of chest pain may accurately predict a high likelihood of a myocardial infarction in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aviles RJ, Askari AT, Lindahl B, Wallentin L, Jia G, Ohman EM, Mahaffey KW, Newby LK, Califf RM, Simoons ML, Topol EJ, Berger P, Lauer MS | title = [[Troponin]] T levels in patients with acute coronary syndromes, with or without renal dysfunction | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 346 | issue = 26 | pages = 2047–52 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12087140 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa013456}}.

The diagnosis of myocardial infarction requires two out of three components (history, ECG, and enzymes).  When damage to the heart occurs, levels of cardiac markers rise over time, which is why [[blood test]]s for them are taken over a 24-hour period. Because these enzyme levels are not elevated immediately following a heart attack, patients presenting with chest pain are generally treated with the assumption that a myocardial infarction has occurred and then evaluated for a more precise diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Braunwald-2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Braunwald E, Antman EM, Beasley JW, Califf RM, Cheitlin MD, Hochman JS, Jones RH, Kereiakes D, Kupersmith J, Levin TN, Pepine CJ, Schaeffer JW, ((Smith EE III)), Steward DE, Théroux P | title=ACC/AHA 2002 guideline update for the management of patients with unstable angina and non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Committee on the Management of Patients With Unstable Angina) | journal=J Am Coll Cardiol | year=2002 | volume=40 | pages=1366–74 | pmid=12383588 | format=[[PDF]] | url=http://www.acc.org/qualityandscience/clinical/guidelines/unstable/incorporated/UA_incorporated.pdf | issue=7 | doi=10.1016/s0735-1097(02)02336-7 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326101602/http://www.acc.org/qualityandscience/clinical/guidelines/unstable/incorporated/UA_incorporated.pdf | archivedate=2009-03-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Angiography==

[[Image:Ha1.jpg|thumb|[[Angiogram]] of the coronary arteries.]]
{{Main|Coronary catheterization}}

In difficult cases or in situations where intervention to restore blood flow is appropriate, coronary [[angiography]] can be performed. A [[catheter]] is inserted into an artery (usually the [[femoral artery]]) and pushed to the vessels supplying the heart. A radio-opaque dye is administered through the catheter and a sequence of x-rays (fluoroscopy) is performed. Obstructed or narrowed arteries can be identified, and [[angioplasty]] applied as a therapeutic measure (see below). Angioplasty requires extensive skill, especially in emergency settings. It is performed by a physician trained in [[interventional cardiology]].

==Histopathology==

{{Further|Timeline of myocardial infarction pathology}}

[[Anatomical pathology|Histopathological]] examination of the heart may reveal infarction at autopsy. Under the microscope, myocardial infarction presents as a circumscribed area of ischemic, coagulative [[necrosis]] (cell death). On gross examination, the infarct is not identifiable within the first 12 hours.&lt;ref name=rubin546&gt;{{cite book |author1=Emanuel Rubin |author2=Fred Gorstein |author3=Raphael Rubin |author4=Roland Schwarting |author5=David Strayer | title = Rubin's Pathology&amp;nbsp;— Clinicopathological Foundations of Medicine | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | date = 2001 | location = Maryland | pages = 546 | isbn = 0-7817-4733-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MI with contraction bands very high mag.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] of a '''myocardial infarction''' (ca. 400x H&amp;E stain ) with prominent contraction band [[necrosis]].]]

The necrotic area is surrounded and progressively invaded by [[granulation tissue]], which will replace the infarct with a fibrous ([[collagen]]ous) [[scar]] (which are typical steps in [[wound healing]]). The interstitial space (the space between cells outside of blood vessels) may be infiltrated with [[red blood cell]]s.&lt;ref name=rubin546/&gt;

These features can be recognized in cases where the perfusion was not restored; reperfused infarcts can have other hallmarks, such as [[contraction band necrosis]].&lt;ref name="Fishbein-1990"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fishbein | first1 = M.

{{Campaignbox War of 1812: Naval}}

The '''Nuku Hiva Campaign''' was an armed conflict between the United States and the [[French Polynesia|Polynesian]] inhabitants of [[Nuku Hiva]] during the [[War of 1812]]. It occurred in 1813, following [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]]'s decision to sail his fleet to the island for repairs before continuing his [[commerce raiding|raid]] against British shipping. Upon arrival, the Americans became involved in a tribal war and allied themselves with the [[Te I'i]] people against the [[Happah]] and [[Tai Pi (province)|Tai Pi]] clans.&lt;ref name="HistoryNet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/war-of-1812-commodore-david-porter-and-the-essex-in-the-south-pacific.htm|title=War of 1812: Commodore David Porter and the Essex in the South Pacific|work=Military History ''Magazine''|publisher=History Net/Weider History Network|date=June 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Operations in the Pacific began in early 1813 when Captain Porter entered the Pacific, via [[Cape Horn]], in the thirty-two gun [[frigate]] {{USS|Essex|1799|6}}. Originally Porter was assigned to rendezvous with two other warships but both encountered enemy resistance before their meeting and Porter went around the Horn alone. The mission was to harass the British whaling industry off South America and around the [[Galápagos Islands]]. For months the Americans cruised the [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]] and they [[Action off James Island|captured]] several British whalers that they placed under navy command. By October 1813, ''Essex'' was in serious need of repairs so Porter decided to head for Nuku Hiva, an island in the [[Marquesas]], fearing that a British squadron would find him if he chose to take refuge in a South American port. The American fleet that went to the Marquesas included USS ''Essex'' and the liberated American whaler ''Barclay'', and nine captured British whalers: {{ship||Seringapatam|1799 ship|2}} (22 guns), ''Greenwich'' (10 guns), {{ship||Montezuma|1804 ship|2}} (18 guns), ''[[Essex Junior]]'' (16 guns), {{ship||Hector|1809 ship|2}} (11 guns), ''Charlton'' (10 guns), {{ship||Sir Andrew Hammond|1800 ship|2}}, and ''Catherine'' and {{ship||New Zealander|1808 ship|2}}, both of eight guns. In total, Captain Porter had just over 200 [[United States Navy]] officers and sailors, accompanied by a small detachment of no more than twenty [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] under the command of [[Lieutenant]] [[John M. Gamble]]. One of the sailors was the young [[midshipman]] [[David Farragut]], later the first United States Navy [[admiral]]. (Porter's son [[David Dixon Porter]] was the second U.S. Navy admiral.) Additionally, many of the prisoners from the prize enemy ships were Americans and they volunteered for service; some of the British captives too volunteered.&lt;ref name="HistoryNet" /&gt;

==Campaign==
===Founding of Madisonville===
Porter arrived off Nuku Hiva, on October 25, 1813 and he renamed it Madison's Island after United States President [[James Madison]]. Then Porter began making preparations to establish the first American naval base in the Pacific, as well as a small [[colony]], named [[Madisonville, Nuku Hiva|Madisonville]], to house the sailors. The small [[Fort Madison, Nuku Hiva|Fort Madison]], of four guns, was also constructed on a hill next to [[Massachusetts Bay, Nuku Hiva|Massachusetts Bay]] where an official flag raising ceremony took place on November 19, a seventeen gun salute was fired and some sort of message was buried in the ground for future Europeans to find, should they attempt to colonize the island after Porter and his men left. The declaration stated that the Te I'is were subjects of the United States and that the latter had officially laid claim to the island which Porter hoped would become an important naval base. In this time the sailors also scraped the [[copper sheathing|copper bottom]] hull of ''Essex'' and used smoke to drive out over 1,000 rats hiding in her works. The Americans described the native warriors as being tall and copper colored, with tattoos over their entire bodies. They wore loin cloths and some had capes made of tree bark; the warriors also carried large clubs or spears. The women were clothed in similar fashion to the men, and friendly to the sailors. A half-naked Englishman named Wilson was found to be living on the island, and had been for many years. He served as interpreter between the Americans and the native [[tribal chief|chiefs]].&lt;ref&gt;Boot, pp. 31-34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downes Expedition===
[[File:Nuku Hiva warrior 1813.jpg|150px|left|thumb|''A warrior of Nuku Hiva'' by [[Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau]], 1813]]
Nuku Hiva, at the time, was inhabited by many tribes of indigenous peoples, separated in villages by mountain peaks thousands of feet high. The area of land around Massachusetts Bay, which became the town of Madisonville, was controlled by Chief Gattanewa of the Te I'i and in return for rights to build the base, Gattanewa demanded that the Americans become his allies and help fight the war against the Happah. While the majority of the Americans were still building their settlement, [[Lieutenant]] [[John Downes (naval officer)|John Downes]], Marine Lieutenant John Gamble and a platoon of forty Marines, were ordered to proceed to an in-land [[redoubt]], located high in the mountains. The main effort of this expedition dragged along a wheeled 6 pound cannon for added effect. The amazement of the aboriginals at gunpowder weapons had already been noted upon their landing on the island. Several hundred Te I'i warriors accompanied the expedition which left the coast in the first week of November. After a journey through the jungle Downes and his men found the fort occupied by 3,000 to 4,000 hostiles. The Te I'i and their American allies attacked; during the fighting a rock hit Downes in the stomach, hurting him. A sailor was wounded by a spear to the neck, but he apparently survived. Lt. Gamble was singled out by a heavily built Happah warrior, who charged at him with a wooden club. Drawing his Mameluke sword Gamble blocked the club from knocking him unconscious as another Marine, seeing Gamble struggling, leveled his musket at the Happah's head. The shot, fired from only a foot away, nearly decapitated the warrior.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The assault on the fort was successful and Downes reported that his men had killed five enemies and that the Te I'i massacred the wounded with clubs. Lieutenant Downes also said that he was very surprised that his allies did not eat the dead; instead they used their bones to make necklaces and fan handles. Over the next few days the chiefs of the Happah arrived at the coast to settle a peace agreement. One of the stipulations required the Happah to fight alongside the Te I'i and Americans in another operation against the Tai Pi.&lt;ref&gt;Boot, pp. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Porter expedition===
Not long after subduing the Happah, the Tai Pi declared war on the Te I'i, the Happah, and the Americans. Thus followed one of the most significant amphibious landings in the history of American operations in the Pacific during the 1800s. It was unopposed but Captain Porter's fleet, combined with around 5,000 friendly warriors, in at least 200 [[canoe|war-canoe]]s, attacked the Tai Pi-held coastline. After that, thirty-six officers and men with a cannon, personally commanded by Porter, led the expedition to a fortress with seven-foot-high walls. A battle began when the Tai Pis ambushed the column in the jungle near the fort. Porter wrote "''We entered the bushes, and at every instant assailed by spears and stones, which came from different parties in the ambuscade. We could hear the snapping of the slings, the whistling of the stones, and the spears came quivering by us, but we could not percieve [sic] from whom they came.''" Skirmishing broke out and the expedition continued forward, encountering heavier resistance the farther they went. The column eventually made it to the fort where a pitched battle began that would last for hours. The Te I'is and Happahs provided the brunt of the attack while the Americans picked off enemy warriors with their muskets; the cannon was aimed at the fortifications. Upon arrival, a Marine sergeant notified Lt. Gamble and Capt. Porter of the hopelessness of their situation. The Marines in his squad were down to three or four cartridges of ammunition. Lt. Gamble and four men were given permission to run back to the beach for a resupply but upon their arrival the situation with their natives allies had deteriorated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Thousands of Tai Pis occupied the heavily defended position and they managed to repel the native attacks. Near the end of the engagement, the Te I'is and Happahs fled, leaving the thirty-six Americans to fend for themselves. Capt. Porter notified Lt. Gamble to order his Marines to cover the retreat back to the beach. Gamble positioned his men at the edge of a bush for one last decisive volley to ensure a strong enemy force did not pursue them. The American force lost one man killed and two wounded. One of the casualties was Lieutenant Downes, who suffered a badly broken leg. "''We returned to the beach much fatigued and harassed with marching and fighting,''" said Porter, who then sailed back to Madisonville.&lt;ref&gt;Boot, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Typee Valley===
[[File:Atlas pittoresque pl 054.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''An 1846 lithograph of Nuka Hiva.'']]
Once word spread that Porter and his allies had been defeated, the Te I'i and the Happah warriors began to turn on the Americans which led them to fear that Madisonville would be overrun and the inhabitants massacred. Porter wrote; "''I had now no alternative, but to prove our superiority by a successful attack upon the Typees.''" Porter organized and led most of his men on a second mission into enemy territory, this time overland to [[Typee Valley]] and with limited assistance from the Te I'i. The valley is a dense nine miles across by three miles and was the heartland of the Tai Pi where their villages were located and where they harvested [[coconut]] and [[breadfruit]]. By making a detour to avoid the heavily defended fort near the coast, Porter could make a surprise attack and use terrain and his superior weapons to their advantage. During one night the column marched to the top of a ridge overlooking the valley but because the Americans were exhausted from a long march, Porter decided to wait until the next morning to attack. The following day was rainy and windy according to reports, moisture had temporarily ruined the gunpowder, so the expedition spent another day resting and waiting for the powder to dry. Finally on November 30, the expedition launched their attack and soon after the Americans and Te I'is found themselves in another ambush which they fought off. After that Captain Porter sent the Tai Pi leaders a message advising them to cease hostilities at once or else their villages would be burned. The captain waited for some time and when it became apparent that the message had been ignored, the advance was continued. American forces and the Te I'is eventually won the day when night came and the enemy disengaged. There were no American casualties&lt;ref&gt;Boot, pp. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter claimed he took no pleasure in conquering a "''happy and heroic people''" and he described the aftermath of the battle as "''a scene of desolation and horror''". The captain also wrote that he left behind a "''line of smoking ruins''" when he started the return march to Madisonville. Tai Pi emissaries were not far behind and they brought the Americans "''countless''" [[hog (swine)|hog]]s as a peace offering. A British magazine later said that Porter was guilty of &lt;blockquote&gt; "''wantonly murdering unoffending savages''" to which the captain replied; "''Many may censure my conduct as wanton and unjust.... But let such reflect on our peculiar situation--a handful of men residing among numerous war-like tribes, liable every moment to be attacked by them and all cut off; our only hopes on safety was in convincing them of our great superiority over them and from what we have already seen, we must either attack them or be attacked.... Wars are not always just, and are rarely free from excesses--my conscience acquits me of any injustice, and no excesses were committed but what the Typees had in their power to stop by ceasing hostilities.''"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Boot, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Seringapatam'' Mutiny===
By 9 December 1813, USS ''Essex'' was repaired and ready for sailing. The sailors were not happy about leaving their Marquesan girlfriends and Porter had to suppress one [[mutiny]] by declaring that he "''would at once put a match to the magazine, and blow them all to eternity.''" A former Royal Navy sailor by the name of Robert White, was brought before Porter, having been accused of mutinous talk about ''Essex Junior''. White denied the accusations, now confirmed by other sailors, infuriating Porter. Porter thus drew his sword, face turning red, and yelled: "Run you scoundrel! Run for your life!" White ran off, jumped overboard, and swam to a nearby canoe.&lt;ref&gt;''Gamble of the Marines'', Raymond J Toner USN&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining 250 crew members remained loyal and ''Essex'' made sail on 9 December 1813 to continue raiding. Most of the fleet left, though ''Sir Andrew Hammond'', ''Seringapatam'', and ''Greenwich'' remained at Nuku Hiva with Lieutenant John Gamble, two midshipmen, nineteen sailors and six prisoners, with the prisoners and some of the sailors being British nationals.

The situation was quiet until on 7 May 1814, the British sailors among the [[garrison]] mutinied. First they released the six prisoners and then attacked Fort Madison before taking over ''Seringapatam'' and getting away. Gamble was wounded in the foot and he was left adrift in a small boat with four others but they eventually made it to ''Sir Andrew Hammond''. Meanwhile the British interpreter Wilson was arousing trouble with the Te I'i by telling them that Porter would not come back. A few days later on 9 May, six of the American sailors were attacked on the beach by the Te I'i; a sixteen-year-old midshipman was killed along with four sailors while two others escaped, one of whom was wounded. Meanwhile, Gamble was alone on his ship, recovering from his wounded foot, when two war-canoes approached for an attack. The cannon of the ship were pre-loaded so single handedly Gamble limped from gun to gun, firing them as fast as possible, until the enemy fell back. On the next morning he gave the order to evacuate Madisonville, there being only eight men left on shore and all were either wounded or ill. Thus ended the existence of America's first naval base and colony in the Pacific Ocean. Captain Porter never returned to the island due to his capture by the British at the [[Battle of Valparaíso]] on March 28, 1814.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Post-script==
The mutineers sailed ''Seringapatam'' to [[New South Wales]]. From there she was sailed back to Great Britain where she was returned to her owners on payment of salvage.

''Cherub'' and {{HMS|Phoebe|1795|2}} had caught up with ''Essex'' and ''Essex Junior'' at Valparaiso. Eventually ''Phoebe'' was able to bring ''Essex'' to battle. The British were able to capture Porter and both American vessels.

Before he left Nuku Hiva, Gamble set fire to ''Greenwich''.&lt;ref&gt;James (1837), Vol. 6, pp.288-9.&lt;/ref&gt; He and seven men (four unfit for duty) then sailed ''Sir Andrew Hammond'' {{convert|2500|mi}} before they had the misfortune to meet up with {{HMS|Cherub|1806|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney (1976), Vol. 6, p.517.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|A first-class share of the salvage money was worth [[£sd|£]]72 13[[shilling|s]] 5[[pence|d]]; a sixth-class share, that of an ordinary seaman, was worth 16s 6d.

'''Orlando''' (or '''Roland''') (1296–1361) was the second-eldest illegitimate son of [[Frederick III of Sicily|Frederick II of Sicily]] by his concubine Sibilla di Sormella. During his father's reign, he lived in the shadows, but he rose to influence in the courts of his half-brother [[Peter II of Sicily|Peter II]] and his nephews, [[Louis of Sicily|Louis]] and [[Frederick III the Simple|Frederick IV]], especially as the leader of the [[House of Barcelona|Catalan]] party after the death of his brother [[Giovanni of Randazzo]]. 

In 1339, he was present fighting the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] then trying to conquer [[Lipari]]. Taken captive, he was freed in November 1340 through the interference of a [[Sienese]] widow, [[Camiola]] Turinga, a woman he promised to marry. He never did and was considered highly ungrateful by contemporaries, including [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]. 

From 1343 to 1345, he was governor of [[Palermo]] and in 1345, ''[[strategos]]'' of [[Messina]]. He supported the [[Giovanni of Randazzo|duke of Randazzo]] as [[regent]] during the reign of Louis and then supported his sister-in-law [[Elisabeth of Carinthia]] after the duke's death. He was sent as an ambassador to [[Sardinia]] on behalf of [[Peter IV of Aragon]] in 1353. He continued to help Elisabeth into the reign of his other nephew [[Frederick the Simple]]. 

He was a soldier and a general during the last wars between the houses of Barcelona and Anjou for possession of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Trinacria]]. He distinguished himself in the [[Battle of Aci]] and in defending Messina from the Angevins. In 1358, he reconquered the area from [[Vizzini]] to [[Avola]]. He died in a spring skirmish at [[Caltanissetta]], during the war between [[Federico Chiaramonte]] and [[Francesco Ventimiglia]]. Orlando married Maria de Stromoncourt, and had four children: Alfonso, Federigo, Juan, and Sybilla.
All boys were Barons of Avola, Sicily only Juan had issue and their descendants,&lt;ref&gt;geneaology.eu&lt;/ref&gt; while Sybilla married into Maltese nobility Michele de Bava, Baron de Djar-il-Bniet in Dingli, Rabat, on the island of Malta and had issue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3955">The '''Parable of the Assassin''' (also known as the '''Parable of the Killer'''),  is a [[parable]] attributed to [[Jesus]].  However, it appears in none of the [[Canonical gospels]] of the [[New Testament]] but only in the non-canonical [[Gospel of Thomas]]. According to the [[Gospel of Thomas]] 98 Jesus said:
:''"The kingdom of the father is like a certain man who wanted to kill a powerful man. In his own house he drew his sword and stuck it into the wall in order to find out whether his hand could carry through. Then he slew the powerful man."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/gthlamb.html |title=Gospel of Thomas (Lambdin Translation) - The Nag Hammadi Library |publisher=Gnosis.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
The scholars of the [[Jesus Seminar]] gave the parable of the assassin a "pink" rating, indicating 
that it is in their opinion probably, but not certainly, an authentic saying of Jesus.  They were influenced by parallels with the parables of the tower builder&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|14:28–14:30||}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the warring king&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|14:31–14:32}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in the [[Gospel of Luke]] (see [[Counting the cost]]), and by the "scandalous nature of the image."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Walter Funk and Roy W. Hoover, ''The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? the Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus'', HarperCollins, 1997, pp. 524–5&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Robert W. Funk|Robert Funk]], "[a]ttributing a parable to Jesus not attested in the canonical gospels and known only for a few years was an act of courage that demanded careful deliberation".&lt;ref name="p. 525"&gt;Robert Walter Funk and Roy W. Hoover, ''The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? the Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus'', HarperCollins, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN006063040X&amp;id=SRI-c0Pf3soC&amp;pg=RA1-PA525&amp;lpg=RA1-PA525&amp;ots=vP-Bse1Hs8&amp;dq=%22parable+of+the+assassin%22&amp;sig=NiYQB6gaCpUu-I-0f2ErfFbcaDE#PRA1-PA525,M1 p. 525]&lt;/ref&gt;  This decision by the Seminar has been criticized for inconsistency, since the parallel parable of the warring king in Luke was ''not'' given a pink rating.&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig A. Evans]], Bruce D. Chilton, ''Authenticating the Words of Jesus'', Brill Academic Publishers, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0391041630&amp;id=Y96yVkPLeioC&amp;pg=RA2-PA411&amp;lpg=RA2-PA411&amp;ots=H4i_fUkshX&amp;dq=%22parable+of+the+assassin%22&amp;sig=-TM9AM60786w4cZIOnSdEbQSWUw#PRA2-PA411,M1 p. 411]&lt;/ref&gt;  The authenticity of this parable has been attacked on the grounds that Jesus would not use a parable that glorifies [[murder]], and because of its use of the phrase "the kingdom of the father" which is not found in the canonical gospels.

==Meaning==
Like the Lucan parables of the warring king and the tower, this parable seems to concern "estimating the cost of an act or the capability to perform it successfully."{{Citation needed|date=December 2009|reason = dead link: http://www.bibletexts.com/texts/parables.htm#assassin }} In Mark 7:21–23, Jesus explains the idea of evil being rehearsed before taking place. "For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: all these evil things come from within, and defile the man."{{Or|date=November 2007}} According to some of the fellows of the Jesus Seminar, "the story line of the parable originally had to do with Davidic reversal, as in David and Goliath: the little guy bests the big guy by taking the precautions a prudent person would take before encountering the village bully".&lt;ref name="p. 525"/&gt; A similar message can be found in the [[parable of the strong man]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

'''Paragon''' ('''Maya''') is a fictional character from [[Electronic Arts]] who first appeared in ''Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects''.

=== Fictional character biography ===
After a century-long search, a young Amazonian warrior, '''Maya''', was chosen from an isolated, primitive, and forgotten society deep within the South American jungle. Matching a specifically required DNA structure, Maya was the perfect candidate for the ultimate weapon. Maya possessed a toxin free physical make-up, Amazonian warrior skills, and the instinctual savagery found at the core of all humanity.

Having acquired the perfect specimen, [[Niles Van Roekel]] ordered her to be put into a prolonged stasis. It would take years to successfully master the fusion of alien tech with humans before Roekel’s team would finally be ready to work on Maya.

After "The Imperfects" were completed, project Paragon was set in motion. Working in a secret facility, the aliens uploaded tactics and combat information into Maya’s brain. Her body was injected with chemicals to augment her already superior muscles and heighten her senses.

Training started shortly after. The girl was forced to fight and defend in various combat scenarios. Exercises were crafted to capitalize on and increase her natural ruthless brutality. It was always strike first and never ask questions. When her mind and body were at peak performance, the alien symbiote was grafted to her spine. The painful transformation intertwined and fused her nerves and muscles with Roekel's own race. It was a tremendous success as Paragon exceeded all of Roekel's expectations. She had become the ultimate killing machine.

But as Maya's awareness increased, so did her desire to escape her creator. The secret laboratory was nothing more than a prison and a threat to her future. Hence, during a particularly intense neural reprogramming session Paragon seized the chance to surprise her captors and violently blaze her way out of the facility.

Paragon ended up in New York. Afraid and confused, Paragon soon encountered [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] during the Imperfect invasion of New York. [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]], however, took Paragon off to the New York [[rapid transit|Subway]] with Magneto giving chase. A battle ensued which saw Magneto defeating Hazmat. After the battle, Magneto saw his chance to have Paragon join his cause in wiping out humanity and attempted to manipulate Paragon into joining him. Paragon, however, attacked Magneto and another battle ensued. This time, Paragon was successful in defeating Magneto.

Paragon, believing that Magneto had created her, asked him what he had done to her. Magneto reassured her he was not to blame for her suffering. Paragon asked who she was, Magneto replying by saying that she already knew that.

Paragon fought her way back into Van Roekel's headquarters and destroyed his means of creating any more Imperfects. Paragon and Van Roekel finally confronted one another and a fight between them soon began. Paragon defeated Van Roekel who told of his reasons for creating the Imperfects before he died.

After this she led the Imperfects to Roekel's Planet to free his homeworld.

=== Powers and abilities ===
Paragon has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and agility as well as invulnerability.  She can [[Teleportation|teleport]] and shoot energy blasts.  She has retractable blades capable of draining organic life-force.

Cooper Roth is a fictional Marvel Comics character who first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' vol. 4 #21 as a member of [[Captain Ultra]]'s team.

=== Fictional character biography ===
After investigating an unsolved crime with teammate [[Gadget (comics)|Gadget]], they ran across a formerly missing supervillain, [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]]. In a sudden flurry of violence, Roth was badly injured, requiring hospitalization and Gadget was killed. Graviton was taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. After an investigation by [[Iron Man]] turned up evidence implicating Roth, Iron Man confronted Paragon and was subsequently attacked by [[Captain Ultra]]. In a following issue, it is revealed that Paragon is under the influence of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], who manipulates him into believing that [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] is responsible for the death of his mother. Roth then attempts to assassinate Graviton, who instead kills Roth before then taking his own life.

=== Powers and abilities ===
He possesses invulnerability due to the ability to control his density, as well as flight, superhuman strength and speed.&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Man'' #22&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Oluf Brøndsted''' (17 November 1780 – 26 June 1842), [[Denmark|Danish]] [[archaeologist]] and traveller.

==Biography==
Brøndsted was born at [[Skanderborg Municipality|Fruering]] in [[Jutland]]. After studying at the [[University of Copenhagen]] (initially majoring in theology but moving to philology from 1802 onwards) he visited Paris in 1806 with his friend [[Georg Koës]]. After remaining there two years, they went together to Italy. Both were zealously attached to the study of antiquities and the tastes and interests they held in common led them, in 1810, to join an expedition to [[Greece]] with [[Otto Magnus von Stackelberg (archaeologist)|Otto Magnus von Stackelberg]], [[Carl Haller von Hallerstein]], the German painter [[Jakob Linckh]], and the then Austrian consul in Greece [[George Christian Gropius]].  Unexpectedly, the following year, Koës died on [[Zante]] at the age of 29 of pneumonia.  The group went its separate ways in order to carry out excavations at different places.  Whilst one uncovered the Temple of [[Zeus]] on [[Aegina]] and the temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Bassae]] in [[Arcadia]], Brøndsted and Linckh in the winter of 1811/12 led the excavations of the shrine of Apollo at [[Karthaia]] on [[Kea]].  Brøndsted was the first Dane who was involved in archeological work in Greece.

After three years of active researches in Greece, Brøndsted returned to Copenhagen in 1813, where, as a reward for his labours, he was appointed extraordinary professor of Greek and philology in the university. He married Frederikke, Koës's sister, who died after the birth of their third child.  During these years, Brøndsted gathered and organized the notes and materials he had brought out of Greece.  His lectures awakened great interest in many students, who even after his death sent out even more Danish expeditions to the Mediterranean world under his successor Ussing (Lindos on Rhodos).

However, as he began to arrange and prepare for publication the vast materials he had collected during his travels, he found that Copenhagen did not afford him the desired facilities, and so he exchanged his professorship for the office of Danish envoy at the papal court in 1818, and took up residence in [[Rome]]. In 1820 and 1821 he visited [[Sicily]] and the [[Ionian Islands]] to collect additional materials for his great work.

In 1826 he went to [[London]], chiefly with a view to studying the [[Elgin Marbles]] and other remains of antiquity in the [[British Museum]], and became acquainted with the principal archaeologists of England. From 1828–1832 he resided in Paris, to superintend the publication of his ''Travels'', and then returned to Copenhagen on being appointed director of the museum of antiquities and the collection of coins and medals. In 1842 he became rector of the university; but a fall from his horse caused his death on the 26 June.

His principal work was the ''Travels and Archaeological Researches in Greece'' (in German and French, 1826-1830), of which only two volumes were published, dealing with the island of [[Ceos]] and the [[metope (architecture)|metopes]] of the [[Parthenon]].

'''Peter Perez Burdett''' (c. 1734 – 9 September 1793) was an 18th-century [[cartographer]], [[surveying|surveyor]], artist, and [[technical drawing|draughtsman]] originally from [[Eastwood, Essex|Eastwood]] in Essex where he inherited a small estate and the name ''Perez'' from his maternal grandfather who was the clergyman there.&lt;ref name=odb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101037243/ |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxforddnb.com |date= |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He would have been notable just for his many appearances in Joseph Wright's pictures but he was also involved with numerous projects including surveying the route for one of the major projects of the industrial revolution, the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]], in 1769. He has been described as "if not in the centre at least in the penumbra of the [[Lunar Society]] of Birmingham".&lt;ref name=left&gt;[Taking Notes on the Left’: The Shadowy Career and Thwarted Ambitions of Peter Burdett], Paul Laxton, UoL, Eighteenth-Century Worlds Research Centre (University of Liverpool) &amp; Walker Art Gallery (NML), 16–17 November 2007, Merseyside Maritime Museum, Liverpool&lt;/ref&gt;
He spent the last years of his life in [[Karlsruhe]], avoiding debtors, but still active in German society. His German daughter married a Count.

==Biography==
Burdett was born 1734 or 1735 in [[Eastwood, Essex|Eastwood]] in Essex, the son of William and Elizabeth Burdett. He inherited a small estate and the name ''Perez'' from his maternal grandfather who was the clergyman in Eastwood.&lt;ref name=odb/&gt; Little is known about his early life until
Burdett met [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] early in the 1760s and he was able to borrow money from him to fund his map making.&lt;ref name=liver&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displayPicture.asp?id=342&amp;venue=2 Liverpool Museums] accessed 17 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Burdett was a model for several of Wright's paintings and he was able to benefit from his friendship and finance whilst Burdett explained the finer points of perspective to Wright.&lt;ref name=liver/&gt;

In about 1766 Wright painted ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery|A Philosopher Giving that Lecture on the Orrery, in which a Lamp is put in place of the Sun]]'' (sometimes called simply ''The Orrery''). The painting depicts a public lecture about the solar system, with a lamp—in place of the sun—illuminating the faces of the orrery and the faces of the audience. Consistent with the astronomical theme, the partially illuminated faces may represent the phases of the [[moon]]. The figure to the left of the philosopher has been clearly identified as Burdett whilst the man to the right is thought to be [[Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers|Washington Shirley, the Earl of Ferrers]] who Burdett stayed with at [[Staunton Harold]] which is just within Leicestershire. The Earl was, like Burdett, interested in science and he did briefly own this painting.

By 1767 he had produced a map of [[Derby]] at a scale of one inch to one mile. With this map Burdett was the second successful claimant of a 1759 challenge made by the Society of Art for those who created county maps at this scale.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|title=Burdett's map of Derbyshire 1767|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/S-w2niH2TwWlma_NjG--zQ|work=A History of the World in 100 Objects|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced the aquatint ''Two Boys Blowing a Bladder by Candle-light''.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;

===Liverpool===
[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby - Peter Perez Burdett and his First Wife Hannah.JPG|thumb|left|Peter and his wife Hannah by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]].]]
In 1768, Burdett moved from Derby to Liverpool to create a map for Lancashire as he had successfully done for Derbyshire. He obtained new patrons and assisted [[George Perry (antiquarian)|George Perry]] on his map and history of Liverpool. Burdett created drawings and wrote descriptions of major buildings for Perry's history of 1773.&lt;ref name=liver/&gt;

Burdett was so successful at identifying and exploiting his new contacts that he invited his friend, Wright, to join him in Liverpool. This was a successful move for Wright too and he quickly received commissions from the local gentry and merchants, however it was Burdett who founded a Society of Artists in 1769 in Liverpool and became its first president.&lt;ref name=liver/&gt; ''Academy by Lamplight'', a 1768–69 painting by Joseph Wright of Derby is thought to be of Burdett's academy.
[[File:BoysBlowingBladder by Peter Perez Burdett.jpg|right|thumb|''Two Boys Blowing a Bladder by Candle-light''. An early aquatint by Burdet after [[Joseph Wright of Derby]]. ]]
The first British aquatint artist is thought to be Burdett, who exhibited these first aquatints in 1772.&lt;ref name=moma/&gt; Burdett brushed acid direct on to an aquatint ground, only using varnish to stop-off large areas of a single tone. His technique appears to have been novel and was different from early methods developed in France.&lt;ref name=moma&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10452&amp;section_id=T003497 The Museum of Modern Art], accessed 17 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Burdett published a first aquatint based on an image by [[John Hamilton Mortimer]], but he eventually sold the process to another cartographer, [[Paul Sandby]].&lt;ref name=odb/&gt; Burdett also developed a process for transferring [[aquatint]] to pottery; it was not a success.
{{A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery|size=400px|align=left}}
Burdett learnt his aquatint technique from J.B. Le Prince of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, I. (1987), ''British Prints, a Dictionary and Price Guide'', Art Collectors' Club, Suffolk. {{ISBN|0-902028-96-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed two plates at the Society of Arts Exhibition of 1772, ''An Etching in imitation of a Wash Drawing'' and ''An Etching from a design of Mr. Mortimer''. In 1773 he exhibited a plate entitled ''The effect of a stained drawing attempted by printing from a plate wrought chemically, without the use of any instrument of sculpture''. There are extant three known images by Burdett, ''Banditti Terrifying Fishermen'' of 1771 and ''Skeleton on a Rocky Shore'', both after the painter J.H. Mortimer, and ''Two Boys Blowing a Bladder by Candle-light'' after Wright of Derby. A copy of the latter in Liverpool Public Library bears on its back the inscription “First Speciman {{sic|hide=y}}of aquatinta invented in Liverpool by P.P. Burdett, 1774, assisted by Mr. S. Chubbard.”

The artist Paul Sandby learnt the basic techniques of aquatint from the Hon. Charles Greville, who himself had purchased the knowledge either from Burdett or from Le Prince. It appears that Greville had received incomplete information, and Sandby found it difficult to produce a plate by Le Prince's method of sifting the rosin over the surface. He discovered that by dissolving the rosin and floating it on the copper a better effect was obtained.
&lt;!-- Sandby used a lift ground technique enabling positive brushwork --&gt;

Benjamin Franklin wrote to Burdett on 21 August 1773 “I should be glad to be inform’d where I can see some example of the new Art you mention of printing in Imitation of Paintings. It must be a most valuable Discovery: but more likely to meet with adequate Encouragement on this side the water than on ours.”&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey, R.T. 1978, ''Printmaking in Britain'', Phaidon, Oxford. Page 59. {{ISBN|0-7148-1838-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1771 he produced 'A Chart for the Harbour of Liverpool’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.formbycivicsociety.org.uk/learning/full_article.asp?storyid=10 |title=Origins of Britain's First Lifeboat Station |publisher=Formbycivicsociety.org.uk |date=29 March 2003 |accessdate=5 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930204424/http://www.formbycivicsociety.org.uk/learning/full_article.asp?storyid=10 |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1772 Survey of the County Palatine of Chester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapforum.com/13/bonhams.htm |title=Bonhams &amp; Brooks |publisher=Mapforum.com |date=11 September 2001 |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karlsruhe===
In 1774 he left Liverpool, to escape debt, and entered the service of [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden]].&lt;ref name=frank&gt;{{cite web|url=http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/framedVolumes.jsp?vol=24&amp;page=144a |title=The Papers of Benjamin Franklin |publisher=Franklinpapers.org |date= |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intriguingly he took with him the painting of himself and his wife, but left his wife to face his debtors. The painting of Burdett and his wife is now in the [[National Gallery in Prague|National Gallery]] in Prague. It recently returned for an exhibition in Liverpool. This was the second time the work has been seen in the United Kingdom since it left with Burdett on his departure from Liverpool in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=liver/&gt;

He did not leave his friends entirely and Joseph Wright visited him in 1774 in south Germany.&lt;ref name=karl/&gt; He married again to Friederike Kotkowski in Germany on 11 July 1787&lt;ref name=karl/&gt; and he had a daughter Anna, who went on to marry a Count. In the same year he was drawing up plans for Karlsruhe marketplace whose outline can still be seen in the layout of today's buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karlsruhe.de/kultur/stadtgeschichte/blick_geschichte/blick73/aufsatz1 Zur Südentwicklung der Karlsruher Innenstadt] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120803141120/http://www.karlsruhe.de/kultur/stadtgeschichte/blick_geschichte/blick73/aufsatz1 |date=3 August 2012 }} by von Rudolf J. Schott, accessed 19 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Burdett died in Karlsruhe on 9 September 1793.

He was a correspondent of [[Benjamin Franklin]]&lt;ref name=frank/&gt; who was a founder member of the Lunar society of Birmingham{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} which included such figures as [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[John Whitehurst]], [[Matthew Boulton]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and [[James Watt]].

The '''Philippine tarsier''' (''Carlito syrichta''), known locally as '''''mawumag''''' in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] and other [[Visayan languages]], '''''magô''''' in [[Winaray]] and '''''mamag''''' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], is a species of [[tarsier]] [[endemic]] to the [[Philippines]]. It is found in the southeastern part of the archipelago, particularly on the islands of [[Bohol Island|Bohol]], [[Samar Island|Samar]], [[Leyte Island|Leyte]] and [[Mindanao]]. It is a member of the approximately 45-million-year-old family [[Tarsiidae]],&lt;ref name="alien" /&gt; whose name is derived from its elongated "[[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]]" or ankle bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.americazoo.com/goto/index/mammals/93.htm | title = Philippine tarsier | work =  America Zoo | accessdate = 2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly a member of the genus ''[[Tarsius]]'',&lt;ref name="2010_Groves_Shekelle"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Groves | first1 = C. | last2 = Shekelle | first2 = M. | title = The Genera and Species of Tarsiidae | journal = International Journal of Primatology | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 1071–1082 | year = 2010  | doi = 10.1007/s10764-010-9443-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is now listed as the only member of the genus '''''Carlito''''', a new genus named after the conservationist Carlito Pizarras.&lt;ref name="2010_Groves_Shekelle" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carlito Pizarras, Also known as tarsier man|url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/photos/carlito-pizarras-known-tarsier-man-photo-081243829.html|publisher=Yahoo! News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its geographic range also includes [[Maripipi, Biliran|Maripipi Island]], [[Siargao Island]], [[Basilan (island)|Basilan Island]] and [[Dinagat Island]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; Tarsiers have also been reported in [[Sarangani]], although they may be different subspecies. &lt;includeonly&gt;Tribal people like the B'laans and [[T'boli]]s have been, for a long time, reporting sightings in the province of [[Sarangani]]. Unfortunately, these reports were merely discarded as a hoax until March 30, 2002 when a pair of these tiny nocturnal [[mammal]]s was captured in the mountainous areas of the municipalities of [[Maitum, Sarangani|Maitum]] and [[Kiamba, Sarangani|Kiamba]] and was brought to the public, proving that this species exists in this coastal province.&lt;/includeonly&gt;

It was introduced to Western biologists during the 20th century.&lt;ref name="visit"&gt;{{cite web | author = Hellingman, Jeroen | date = 2004-04-24 | url = http://www.bohol.ph/article44.html | title =  A visit to the Philippine tarsier | work =  Bohol, Philippines | accessdate = 2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anatomy and morphology ==

The Philippine tarsier measures only about {{convert|85|to|160|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} in height, making it one of the smallest [[primate]]s. The small size makes it difficult to spot. The mass for males is between {{convert|80|-|160|g|abbr=on|oz}}, usually lighter for females, somewhat heavier than other tarsiers such as the [[pygmy tarsier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Gron KJ | date = 22 Jul 2008 | work = Primate Factsheets | url = http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/tarsier | title= Tarsier (''Tarsius'') Taxonomy, Morphology, &amp; Ecology | accessdate = 23 Aug 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average adult is about the size of an adult human fist.

The female tarsier has multiple sets of breasts, but the only functional set is at the pectoralis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hellingman|first=Jeroen|title=The Philippine Tarsier|url=http://www.bohol.ph/article15.html|publisher=Bohol Philippines|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other breasts are used as anchor points for the newborn tarsiers. The gestation period lasts 180 days, or 6 months, after which only one tarsier is born. The newborn tarsier is born with much fur and eyes open. Its body and head length is about 70&amp;nbsp;mm, and its tail is around 115&amp;nbsp;mm long.

Like all tarsiers, the Philippine tarsier's [[eye]]s are fixed in its [[skull]]; they cannot move in their sockets. Instead, a special adaptation in the neck allows its round head to be rotated 180°. Their eyes are disproportionately large, having the largest eye-to-body size ratio of all mammals. These huge eyes provide this nocturnal animal with excellent night vision.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.philippines-travel-guide.com/philippine-tarsier.html | title = Philippine tarsier | work =  Philippines Travel Guide | accessdate = 2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In bright light, the tarsier's eyes can constrict until the pupil appears to be only a thin spot. In low light or darkness, the pupil can dilate and fill up almost the entire eye.&lt;ref name="suicide"&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippine tarsier known to commit violence|newspaper=Philippine Inquirer|date=May 23, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large membranous ears are mobile,&lt;ref name="tripod"&gt;{{cite web | author = Flannery, S | date = 15 October 2003 |  url = http://members.tripod.com/uakari/tarsius_syrichta.html | title = Philippine tarsier | work =  The Primata | accessdate = 2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; appearing to be almost constantly moving, allowing the tarsier to hear any movement.

[[Image:Angrytarsier.jpg|left|thumb|Philippine tarsier, showing lower jaw [[dentition]]]]
The Philippine tarsier has thin, rough fur which is colored gray to dark brown. The narrow tail, usually used for balance, is bald except for a tuft of hair at the end, and is about twice the body length. Its elongated "tarsus", or ankle bone, which gives the tarsier its name, allows it to jump at least 3 m from tree to tree.&lt;ref name="guide"/&gt; Its long digits are tipped with rounded pads that allow ''C. syrichta'' to cling easily to trees and to grip almost any surface. The thumb is not truly opposable, but the first toe is. All of the digits have flattened nails, except for the second and third toes, which have sharp claws specialized for grooming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.brainmuseum.org/Specimens/primates/tarsier/index.html | title = The Philippine tarsier | work =  Comparative Mammalian Brain Collections, brainmuseum.org | accessdate = 2006-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dentition|dental formula]] is {{DentalFormula|upper=2:1:3:3|lower=1:1:3:3}}, with relatively small upper canines.&lt;ref name="tripod"/&gt;

== Range and distribution ==

The Philippine tarsier, as its name suggests, is endemic to the Philippine archipelago.&lt;ref name= fieldmuseum/&gt; ''C. syrichta'' populations are generally found in the southeastern part of the archipelago. Established populations are present primarily on the islands of Bohol, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao. It has also been found on various isolated islands within its known range, such as Maripipi Island, Siargao Island, Basilan Island and Dinagat Island.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

== Ecology and life history ==
[[File:Bohol.tarsier jtlimphoto.JPG|thumb|Philippine tarsiers in [[Bohol]].]]
[[Image:Tarsius Syrichta-GG.jpg|thumb|Tarsier tree climbing]]

=== Habitat ===

The Philippine tarsier's habitat is the second-growth, secondary forest, and primary forest from sea level to {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=fieldmuseum&gt;{{cite web | author = Heaney| year = 2002 | title = Tarsius syrichta | url = http://www.fieldmuseum.org/Philippine_Mammals/Tarsius_syrichta.htm | work = The Field Museum | accessdate = 2006-11-15|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its habitat also includes [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical rainforest]] with dense vegetation and [[tree]]s that offer it protection such as tall [[grass]]es, bushes, and [[bamboo]] shoots. It prefers dense, low-level vegetation in secondary forests, with perching sites averaging 2 m above the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jachowski, D. S. | author2 = Pizzaras, C. | date = 2003-09-10 | title = Introducing an innovative semi-captive environment for the Philippine tarsier (''Tarsius syrichta'') | journal = Zoo Biology | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 101–109 | doi = 10.1002/zoo.20023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Home range ====

Early studies showed that the Philippine tarsier has a home [[range (biology)|range]] of 1 to 2 hectares,&lt;ref name="adw"&gt;{{cite web | author = Kubicek, C. | year = 1999 | url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Tarsius_syrichta.html | title = Tarsius syrichta | work = Animal Diversity Web | accessdate = 2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more recent research shows that home ranges averaged 6.45 ha for males and 2.45 ha for females &lt;!-- (MCP and Kernel 95%) --&gt;, allowing for a density of 16 male and 41 female tarsiers per 100 ha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Neri-Arboleda, I. | author2 = Stott, P. | author3 = Arboleda, N. P. | date = 2002-06-25 | title = Home ranges, spatial movements and habitat associations of the Philippine tarsier (''Tarsius syrichta'') in Corella, Bohol | journal = Journal of Zoology | volume = 257 | issue = 3 | pages = 387–402 | doi = 10.1017/S0952836902000997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While both male and female tarsiers are solitary animals, they cross each other's paths under the cover of nightfall as they hunt for prey. They travel up to 1.5&amp;nbsp;km across the forest and the optimal area is more than 6 ha.&lt;ref name="alien"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.offthefence.com/content/programme.php?ID=270&amp;Categories=3 | title = Tarsier – the littlest alien | work = Off The Fence | accessdate = 2006-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predators ===

Besides human hunters, [[feral cat]]s banished from nearby communities are the species' main predators, though some large birds are known to prey on it, as well.&lt;ref name="feral"&gt;{{cite web|author=France-Presse, A. |year=2004 |url=http://www.inq7.net/globalnation/sec_phe/2005/jan/19-01.htm |title=Furry mascot of RP forest lives on borrowed time |work=INQ7.net |accessdate=2006-11-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008202739/http://www.inq7.net/globalnation/sec_phe/2005/jan/19-01.htm |archivedate=2006-10-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its nocturnal and arboreal habits, the Philippine tarsier is most likely to fall prey to [[owl]]s, or to small carnivores which it can encounter in its canopy homes.

==== Feeding ecology ====

The Philippine tarsier is primarily [[Insectivore|insectivorous]], its diet consists of insects, spiders, small crustaceans, and small vertebrates such as small lizards and birds. ''C. syrichta'' preys on live insects, particularly [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s and [[grasshopper]]s. Upon seizing its prey, the tarsier carries it to its mouth using both hands.&lt;ref name="adw"/&gt;

As [[predator]]s, Philippine tarsiers may help to structure insect communities. To the extent that it is preyed upon by other animals, it may [[Biological interaction|impact predator populations]].

=== Behavior ===
The Philippine tarsier is a shy, [[Nocturnal animal|nocturnal]]&lt;ref name="adw"/&gt; animal that leads a mostly hidden life. During the day, it sleeps in dark hollows close to the ground, near tree trunks and shrubs deep in the impenetrable bushes and forests. It becomes active only at night; with its keen sight and ability to manoeuvre around trees, it is able to avoid humans.&lt;ref name="visit"/&gt;

It is [[arboreal]],&lt;ref name="tripod"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adw"/&gt; habitually clinging vertically to trees and capable of leaping from branch to branch.

The Philippine tarsier is [[solitary (disambiguation)|solitary]]. However, populations and individuals have been found to have either [[Monogamy|monogamous]] or [[Polygamy|polygamous]] mating patterns.&lt;ref name="tripod"/&gt;

==== Communication ====
The Philippine tarsier uses varied means of communication. Although less vocal than many primate species, it uses calls which are often associated with territorial maintenance and male-female spacing.&lt;ref name="adw"/&gt; Three different audible calls have been documented. One is its "loud call"—a piercing single note. The second sound is a soft, sweet, bird-like twill, a sound of contentment. When several tarsiers come together, the combined effect of this chirping is a locust-like sound.&lt;ref name = "Wharton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wharton|first=Charles|title=The tarsier in captivity|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|year=1950|volume=31|issue=3|pages=260|doi=10.2307/1375291 |jstor=1375291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These mammals can also vocalize in an ultrasound frequency range of 70&amp;nbsp;kHz and can pick up frequencies above 90&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2012-02-08 | url = http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2012/02/20122802142188309.html | title = Tiny primate uses 'private channel to talk' | accessdate = 2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of vocal communication is used as a distress call made by infants when they are separated from their mothers. It is also the call made by males to their mates during mating season.

Tarsiers also communicate [[olfactory communication|through a scent]] from the circumoral gland located around the mouth, which the female uses to mark her mate. The males mark their [[territorial marking|territory]] with their [[urine]]. Tarsiers perform tactile communication through social grooming, removing dead skin and parasites, a behaviour observed in females on adult males, as well as in females on their offspring.&lt;ref name="tripod"/&gt;

==== Reproduction ====
[[Image:Babytarsier.jpg|thumb|right|Tarsier with a baby]]

The Philippine tarsier's [[gestation]] period lasts about six months, while the female's [[estrous cycle]] lasts 25–28 days.&lt;ref name="tripod"/&gt; The mating season lasts from April to May. The males deposit a [[mating plug]] in the female's vagina after intercourse. The female gives birth to one offspring per gestation. The infant is born with hair and with its eyes open. The females carry their infants in their mouths. A newborn can already cling to branches and in less than a month after birth, it can start leaping. 

Newborns are breastfed until 60 days after birth. After two years of age, the tarsier is sexually mature and able to reproduce.

== Etymology and taxonomic history ==
[[File:Philippine Tarsier.jpg|thumbnail|Philippine tarsier climbing a tree]]
The Philippine tarsier is related to the [[Horsfield's tarsier]] of [[Borneo]] and [[Sumatra]] and to several species of tarsier on [[Sulawesi]] and nearby islands in the genus ''[[Tarsius]]''. Although all living tarsiers had been conventionally placed in the single [[genus]] ''Tarsius'', Shekelle and Groves (2010) placed the distinctive Philippine tarsier in its own genus, ''Carlito''.&lt;ref name="2010_Groves_Shekelle"/&gt;

The Philippine tarsier is related to other primates, including monkeys, [[lemur]]s, [[gorilla]]s, and [[human]]s, but it occupies a small evolutionary branch between the [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] [[prosimian]]s, and the [[Haplorrhini|haplorrhine]] [[simian]]s. While it is a prosimian, it has some [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] features that caused scientists to classify it as a haplorrhine and, therefore, more closely related to apes and monkeys than to the other prosimians.

The smallest primate is the [[Madame Berthe's mouse lemur]] (''Microcebus berthae''),&lt;ref name="Mittermeier"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mittermeier | first = R.A. | authorlink = Russell Mittermeier | title = Lemurs of Madagascar | edition = 2nd | page = 98 | publisher = Conservation International | year = 2006 | isbn=1-881173-88-7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; at around one third the weight of this species.&lt;ref&gt;Gron KJ. (2009-02-11). Primate Factsheets: [http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/mouse_lemur/taxon Mouse lemur (''Microcebus'')] Taxonomy, Morphology, &amp; Ecology. Accessed 2009 August&lt;/ref&gt; The superlative 'smallest monkey' often refers to the [[pygmy marmoset]] (''Cebuella pygmaea''), an animal with a larger body size. The Philippine tarsier is considered to be the mammal with the biggest eyes, 16&amp;nbsp;mm across, in proportion to its body size.&lt;ref&gt;arkive.org [http://www.arkive.org/philippine-tarsier/tarsius-syrichta/info.html species profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine tarsier was only introduced to Western biologists in the 18th century through the missionary J.G. Camel's description given to J. Petiver of an animal said to have come from the Philippines. Petiver published Camel's description in 1705 and named the animal ''Cercopithecus luzonis minimus'' which was the basis for Linnaeus' (1758) ''Simia syrichta'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linnæus|first=Carl|title=Systema naturæ per regna tria naturæ, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. Tomus I|year=1758|publisher=Laurentius Salvius|location=Holmiæ|page=29|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/80764#page/39/mode/1up|edition=10th|accessdate=21 November 2012|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually ''Carlito syrichta'', the current scientific name.&lt;ref name=2010_Groves_Shekelle/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cabrera |first=Angel |date=May 1923 |title= On the Identification of ''Simia syrichta'' Linnaeus |journal= Journal of Mammalogy |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=89–91 |doi=10.2307/1373538  |id=  |jstor=1373538 |publisher=American Society of Mammalogists }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the locals, the tarsier is known as ''mamag'', ''mago'', ''magau'', ''maomag'', ''malmag'', and ''magatilok-iok''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bohol.ph/article.php?id=15 The Philippine tarsier] www.bohol.ph Retrieved 18 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[subspecies]] are presently recognized: ''C. s. syrichta'' from Leyte and Samar, ''C. s. fraterculus'' from Bohol, and ''C. s. carbonarius'' from Mindanao.&lt;ref name=2010_Groves_Shekelle/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110911000816/http://www.bohol.net/PTFI/tarsier.htm Philippine tarsier: ''Tarsius syrichta''] www.bohol.net Retrieved 19 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUCN]] taxonomic note lists two subspecies, but the non-nominate one is poorly defined at present, so the species is treated as a whole. ''Tarsius syrichta carbonarius'' and ''Tarsius s. fraterculus'': Hill (1955) recognized these taxa as weakly defined subspecies. [[Carsten Niemitz|Niemitz]] (1984) found the differences to be insignificant based upon comparisons with museum specimens. Musser and Dagosto (1987) felt that the available museum specimens were insufficient to resolve the issue, but mentioned that Heaney felt that a single male tarsier from Dinagat might be distinct. Groves (2001) did not recognize any subspecies of ''C. syrichta'',&lt;ref name="IUCN" /&gt; but Groves and Shekelle (2010) recognized the subspecies ''C. s. fraterculus'', ''C. s. syrichta'', and ''C. s. carbonarius'' when splitting the species of ''Tarsius'' into ''Carlito''.&lt;ref name=2010_Groves_Shekelle/&gt;

== Threats to the species ==
[[File:Bohol Tarsier.jpg|thumb|right|Philippine tarsier (''C. syrichta''), one of the smallest primates]]
For the past 45 million years, tarsiers have inhabited rainforests around the world, but now they exist on only a few islands in the Philippines, Borneo, and Indonesia.&lt;ref name="alien"/&gt; In Bohol, the Philippine tarsier was a common sight in the southern part of the island until the 1960s. Since then, the number has dropped to around 700 on the island according to the [[Philippine Tarsier Foundation]].&lt;ref name="PTF"&gt;{{cite web | title = Efforts on to save tarsier exsistence &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93;| url = http://www.tarsierfoundation.org/news/efforts-on-to-save-tarsier-exsistence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once protected by the humid rainforests and mist-shrouded hills, these primates struggle to survive as their home is cleared for crop growing.

Due to the quickly growing human population, which causes more and more forests to be converted to farmland, housing areas, and roads, the place where the Philippine tarsier can live its secluded life is disappearing.&lt;ref name="visit"/&gt; The dwindling of Philippine forests—the Philippine tarsier's natural forest habitat—has posed a grave and significant threat to the survival of the Philippine tarsier. Indiscriminate and [[illegal logging]], cutting of trees for firewood, ''kaingin'' or [[slash and burn]] method of agriculture, and human urbanization have encroached on the habitats of the tarsier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Querijero, D. A. |date=2005-04-24 |url=http://www.boholprovince.com/articles.php?article_id=58 |title=RP tarsier: A new star of the biodiversity world |accessdate=2006-11-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006215648/http://www.boholprovince.com/articles.php?article_id=58 |archivedate=2006-10-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, indigenous superstition, coupled with relatively thick rainforest, particularly in Sarangani province, has apparently preserved this endangered species. [[Indigenous peoples of Asia|Indigenous]] tribes leave the Philippine tarsiers in the wild because they fear that these animals could bring bad luck. One belief passed down from ancient times is that they are pets belonging to spirits dwelling in giant fig trees, known as balete trees. If people harm tarsiers, they need to apologize to the spirits of the forest, or they are thought to encounter sickness or hardship in life.&lt;ref name="alien"/&gt;

Tarsiers in the Philippines have been sought out as pets or sold for trade, despite their low survival rate outside of their natural habitat, where they feed on live insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santos|first=Matikas|title=Tarsier, ‘icon of PH tourism’, sought out as pets—foundation |url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/79825/tarsier-icon-of-ph-tourism-sought-out-as-pets-foundation|accessdate=4 January 2014|newspaper=Inquirer.net|date=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Displays by private people in [[Loboc, Bohol]] &lt;ref name="visit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bundok"/&gt; tend to diminish the lives of tarsiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bohol.net/PTFI/proclaim.htm |title=President of The Philippine – Proclamation No. 1030 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2000-05-27 |accessdate=2016-12-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000527091551/http://www.bohol.net/PTFI/proclaim.htm |archivedate=2000-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some feel that the display of captive tarsiers might encourage tourists to acquire them illegally as pets.&lt;ref name="bundok"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071130143540/http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/3712/tarsier.html Philippine Wildlife: The Philippine Tarsier] www.geocities.com Retrieved 25 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarsiers do not do well in captivity. Life expectancy decreases by  2 to 12 years (if taken from the wild), as compared to the 24 years the tarsier can live to in the wild.&lt;ref name="suicide" /&gt; The tarsier can develop sore eyes, which is an indication of a poor diet. Also, the lighting usually used in captivity can cause long-lasting damage to the eyes.&lt;ref name = "Wharton" /&gt; Another danger of captivity is the creature's tendency to commit suicide. Because the tarsier is often shy and nervous, many activities associated with captivity (such as camera flashes, being touched, and being kept in an enclosure) stresses the animal.  Such stress leads to the tarsier hitting its head against objects, thus killing it because of its thin skull.&lt;ref name="suicide" /&gt;

=== Impact on humans ===

No negative impact is known of the Philippine tarsier on humans, as long as it is in its native environment. However, when kept as pets, the species may spread worms and other parasites to its human owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=World Association of Zoos|author2=Aquariums|last-author-amp=yes|title=Philippine Tarsier|url=http://www.waza.org/en/zoo/visit-the-zoo/primates-1254385523/prosimians-1254385523/tarsius-syrichta|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==
[[File:New PHP200 Banknote (Reverse).jpg|thumb|right|The Philippine tarsier is depicted on the reverse of the 200 [[Philippine peso|peso]] banknote along with the [[Chocolate Hills]].]]
In 1986, 1988, and 1990, the Philippine tarsier was assessed as [[endangered]] by the IUCN Conservation Monitoring Centre. On September 13, 1991, the [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources]] issued DENR Administrative Order Number 48 (DAO 48), which also listed the Philippine tarsier as endangered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://eelink.net/~asilwildlife/DENR1.html | title = DENR Administrative Order No. 48 | work =  North American Association for Environmental Education | accessdate = 2006-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, it was assessed as [[lower risk]]/[[conservation-dependent]] by Baillie and Groom-bridge. In 2000, the IUCN &lt;ref name=MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Groves|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; assessed the Philippine tarsier as [[data deficient]],&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; which means that inadequate information was available to make a direct or indirect assessment of its risks of [[extinction]] based on its distribution and/or population status.

The most recent IUCN red list assessment, in 2008, classified the Philippine tarsier as [[near threatened]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; This classification is based on an estimated significant decline over the last three generations (about 20 years), but less than 30%, due to habitat loss and because of poaching for the pet trade.

The Philippine tarsier is listed in Appendix II of [[CITES]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Unep-wcmc | year = 2005 | title = Checklist of mammals listed in the CITES appendices and in EC Regulation 338/97 | edition = 7th | url =  http://www.ukcites.gov.uk/pdf_files/jncc380.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Endangered Species Act|U.S. ESA]] classifies it as threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Wilson, D. E. |editor2=D. M. Reeder |year=1993 |title=Mammal Species of the World |edition=2nd |url=http://nmnhgoph.si.edu/msw/ |chapter=''Tarsius syrichta'' |chapterurl=http://nmnhgoph.si.edu/cgi-bin/wdb/msw/names/query/11077 |accessdate=2006-11-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022205455/http://nmnhgoph.si.edu/msw/ |archivedate=2006-10-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Tarsier sanctuary is maintained in the town of [[Corella, Bohol|Corella]] ([[Bohol]]). Run by the [[Philippine Tarsier Foundation]], it has a visitor centre and habitat preserve/sanctuary of 7000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a natural forest.&lt;ref name="visit" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|title=The Travel Show – Philippines|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a51ucyVvswM|accessdate=28 May 2014|newspaper=BBC – British Broadcasting Corporation|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation legislation ===
Several laws have been passed to protect and conserve the Philippine tarsier. DENR Administrative Order No. 38, Series of 1991 (DAO No. 38) included the Philippine tarsier among the national protected wildlife species and proposed its listing under Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Moreover, the IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group had given the species Conservation Priority Rating 4, which means that the species is highly vulnerable and threatened by habitat destruction and/or hunting.

Republic Act No. 7586, otherwise known as the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) Act of 1991 mandates the establishment of appropriate [[sanctuary|sanctuaries]] to preserve and protect the Philippine tarsier.

Proclamation 1030 was signed by then [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] on June 23, 1997, declaring the Philippine tarsier a specially protected [[fauna]]l [[species]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20000527091551/http://www.bohol.net/PTFI/proclaim.htm]

Also, legislation at other local levels includes provincial ordinances and proclamations (Bohol Province), municipal ordinances (Corella), and Barangay ordinances (Canapnapan, etc.).

On July 30, 2001, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] signed Republic Act No. 9147, also known as the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act, that provided for the conservation and protection of wildlife resources and their habitats, including the Philippine tarsier, and its inclusion as a flagship species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9147.html R.A. 9147] Chan Robles Virtual Law Library Retrieved 13 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation initiatives ===

Conserving [[biodiversity|biological diversity]] involves the protection of natural or semi-natural ecosystems, the restoration and rehabilitation of degraded lands, and [[ex-situ conservation|''ex situ'' conservation]] techniques.&lt;ref name="bwf"&gt;[http://www.bwf.org/bk/pamayanan/r-efforts.html Philippine Biodiversity Conservation Efforts] www.bwf.org Retrieved 18 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[In-situ conservation|''In situ'' conservation]] is the maintenance of plant and animal genetic material in their natural habitats. The aim of ''in situ'' conservation is to allow the population to maintain itself within its community and in the environment to which it is adapted so that it has the potential for continued [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="bwf"/&gt; [[Protected area]]s are among the most valuable ''in situ'' conservation tool and cost-effective means for preserving genes, species, and habitats and for maintaining various ecological processes of importance to humanity.

Two groups are involved in the conservation of the Philippine tarsier: Endangered Species International (ESI) and the Philippine Tarsier Foundation. ESI works in Mindanao Island where the conservation group created a tarsier sanctuary, planted endangered trees to reforest tarsier habitat, and conducts research and educational activities. In partnership with local groups and government, ESI established the tarsier trail including a viewpoint on habitat. Interpretative boards about plants and animals found in the sanctuary are displayed.

'''Psychological egoism''' is the view that humans are always motivated by self-interest and selfishness, even in what seem to be acts of [[altruism]].  It claims that, when people choose to help others, they do so ultimately because of the personal benefits that they themselves expect to obtain, directly or indirectly, from doing so.  This is a [[Descriptive ethics|descriptive]] rather than [[Normative ethics|normative]] view, since it only makes claims about how things are, not how they ought to be.  It is, however, related to several other normative forms of egoism, such as [[ethical egoism]] and [[rational egoism]].

A specific form of psychological egoism is '''psychological hedonism''', the view that the ultimate motive for all voluntary human action is the desire to experience [[pleasure]] or to avoid [[suffering|pain]].  Many discussions of psychological egoism focus on this type, but the two are not the same:  theorists have explained behavior motivated by self-interest without using pleasure and pain as the [[final cause]]s of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Shaver (2002); Moseley (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological hedonism argues actions are caused by both a need for pleasure immediately and in the future. However, immediate gratification can be sacrificed for a chance of greater, future pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Moore (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Further, humans are not motivated to strictly avoid pain and only pursue pleasure, but, instead, humans will endure pain to achieve the greatest net pleasure.  Accordingly, all actions are tools for increasing pleasure or decreasing pain, even those defined as altruistic and those that do not cause an immediate change in satisfaction levels.

==Foundations==
Beginning with ancient philosophy, [[Epicureanism]] claims humans live to maximize pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe, T. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Epicurus#Pleasure as absence of suffering|Epicurus]] argued the theory of human behavior being motivated by pleasure alone is evidenced from infancy to adulthood. Humanity performs altruistic, honorable, and virtuous acts not for the sake of another or because of a moral code but rather to increase the well being of the self.

In modern philosophy, [[Utilitarianism#Jeremy Bentham|Jeremy Bentham]] asserted, like Epicurus, that human behavior is governed by a need to increase pleasure and decrease pain.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bentham (1789)&lt;/ref&gt;  Bentham explicitly described what types and qualities of pain and pleasure exist, and how human motives are singularly explained using psychological hedonism.  Bentham attempted to quantify psychological hedonism. Bentham endeavored to find the ideal human behavior based on [[Felicific calculus|hedonic calculus]] or the measurement of relative gains and losses in pain and pleasure to determine the most pleasurable action a human could choose in a situation.

From an evolutionary perspective, [[Herbert Spencer]], a psychological egoist, argued that all animals primarily seek to survive and protect their lineage. Essentially, the need for the individual and for the individual's immediate family to live supersedes the others' need to live.&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, W (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  All species attempt to maximize their own chances of survival and, therefore, well being.  Spencer asserted the best adapted creatures will have their pleasure levels outweigh their pain levels in their environments.  Thus, pleasure meant an animal was fulfilling its egoist goal of self survival, and pleasure would always be pursued because species constantly strive for survival.

==Contributions to modern psychology==

===Psychoanalysis===
Whether or not Sigmund Freud was a psychological egoist, his concept of the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] borrowed much from psychological egoism and psychological hedonism in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Wallwork, E. (1991). p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; The pleasure principle rules the behavior of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|Id]] which is an unconscious force driving humans to release tension from unfulfilled desires. When Freud introduced [[Thanatos#In psychology and medicine|Thanatos]] and its opposing force, [[Eros (concept)#Sigmund Freud|Eros]], the pleasure principle emanating from psychological hedonism became aligned with the Eros, which drives a person to satiate sexual and reproductive desires.&lt;ref&gt;Wallwork, E. (1991). p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, Thanatos seeks the cessation of pain through death and the end of the pursuit of pleasure: thus a hedonism rules Thanatos, but it centers on the complete avoidance of pain rather than psychological hedonist function which pursues pleasure and avoids pain. Therefore, Freud believed in qualitatively different hedonisms where the total avoidance of pain hedonism and the achievement of the greatest net pleasure hedonism are separate and associated with distinct functions and drives of the human psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Wallwork, E. (1991). p. 132-33&lt;/ref&gt; Although Eros and Thanatos are ruled by qualitatively different types of hedonism, Eros remains under the rule of Jeremy Bentham's [[Quantity|quantitative]] psychological hedonism because Eros seeks the greatest net pleasure.

===Behaviorism===
Traditional [[behaviorism]] dictates all human behavior is explained by [[Classical Conditioning|classical conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]].  Operant conditioning works through [[reinforcement]] and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] which adds or removes pleasure and pain to manipulate behavior.  Using pleasure and pain to control behavior means behaviorists assumed the principles of psychological hedonism could be applied to predicting human behavior.  For example, [[Edward Thorndike#Thorndike's theory of learning|Thorndike's law of effect]] states that behaviors associated with pleasantness will be learned and those associated with pain will be extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;Young, P. T. (1936). p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; Often, behaviorist experiments using humans and animals are built around the assumption that subjects will pursue pleasure and avoid pain.&lt;ref&gt;Young, P. T. (1936) and Mehiel, R. (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Although psychological hedonism is incorporated into the fundamental principles and experimental designs of behaviorism, behaviorism itself explains and interprets only observable behavior and therefore does not theorize about the ultimate cause of human behavior. Thus, behaviorism uses but does not strictly support psychological hedonism over other understandings of the ultimate drive of human behavior.

== The debate ==
Psychological egoism is controversial.  Proponents cite evidence from introspection: reflection on one's own actions may reveal their motives and intended results to be based on self-interest.   Psychological egoists and hedonists have found through numerous observations of natural human behavior that behavior can be manipulated through reward and punishment both of which have direct effects of pain and pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;See Bentham 1789.  [[Thomas Hobbes]] is also often read as a psychological egoist, but this is fairly controversial, especially in respect of whether or not he used it to ground his moral theory.  See Gert (1967) and Lloyd &amp; Sreedhar (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the work of some social scientists has [[empirical]]ly supported this theory.&lt;ref&gt;Slote, M. A. (1964). "An Empirical Basis for Psychological Egoism," ''Journal of Philosophy'' 61: 530-537&lt;/ref&gt; Further, they claim psychological egoism posits a theory that is a more [[Occam's razor|parsimonious]] explanation than competing theories.&lt;ref name="Sober, E., &amp; Wilson, D. S. 1999"&gt;Sober, E., &amp; Wilson, D. S. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents have argued that psychological egoism is not more parsimonious than other theories.  For example, a theory that claims altruism occurs for the sake of altruism explains altruism with less complexity than the egoistic approach. The psychological egoist asserts humans act altruistically for selfish reasons even when cost of the altruistic action is far outweighed by the reward of acting selfishly because altruism is performed to fulfill the desire of a person to act altruistically.&lt;ref name="Sober, E., &amp; Wilson, D. S. 1999"/&gt; Other critics argue that it is false either because it is an over-simplified interpretation of behavior&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Butler|Butler, J.]] (1726). ''Fifteen Sermons Preached at the Rolls Chapel'', in ''The Works of Bishop Butler'', J. H. Bernard (ed.), London: Macmillan, Sermons I and XI.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hume"&gt;[[David Hume|Hume, David]] (1751). ''An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals''. Public domain. ([[s:An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals|link]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Nagel|Nagel, Thomas]] (1970). ''The Possibility of Altruism''. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or that there exists empirical evidence of altruistic behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Batson|Batson, C.D.]] (1991). ''The Altruism Question: Toward a Social-Psychological Answer'', Hillsdale, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently, some have argued that [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|evolutionary theory]] provides evidence against it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Elliott Sober|Sober, E.]] &amp; [[David Sloan Wilson|D.S. Wilson]] (1998). ''Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior'', Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have stated that proponents of psychological egoism often confuse the satisfaction of their own desires with the satisfaction of their own ''self-regarding'' desires. Even though it is true that every human being seeks his own satisfaction, this sometimes may only be achieved via the well-being of his neighbor. An example of this situation could be phoning for an ambulance when a car accident has happened. In this case, the caller desires the well-being of the victim, even though the desire itself is the caller's own.&lt;ref&gt;Ethics and human well-being: an introduction to moral philosophy. Year 1996. Chapter 1. Psychological Egoism. By Edward Jarvis Bond.&lt;/ref&gt;

To counter this critique, psychological egoism asserts that all such desires for the well being of others are ultimately derived from self-interest.  For example, German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was a psychological egoist for some of his career, though he is said to have repudiated that later in his campaign against [[morality]]. He argues in §133 of ''[[The Dawn (book)|The Dawn]]'', that in such cases compassionate impulses arise out of the projection of our identity unto the object of our feeling. He gives some hypothetical examples as illustrations to his thesis: that of a person, feeling horrified after witnessing a personal feud, coughing blood, or that of the impulse felt to save a person who is drowning in the water. In such cases, according to Nietzsche, there comes into play unconscious fears regarding our own safety. The suffering of another person is felt as a threat to our own happiness and sense of safety, because it reveals our own vulnerability to misfortunes, and thus, by relieving it, one could also ameliorate those personal sentiments.  Essentially, proponents argue that altruism is rooted in self-interest whereas opponents claim altruism occurs for altruism's sake or is caused by a non-selfish reason.&lt;ref&gt;Mees, U., &amp; Schmitt, A. (2008), Sober, E., &amp; Wilson, D. S. (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

== The problem of apparent altruism ==
David Hume once wrote, "What interest can a fond mother have in view, who loses her health by assiduous attendance on her sick child, and afterwards languishes and dies of grief, when freed, by its death [the child's], from the slavery of that attendance?".&lt;ref name="hume" /&gt;  It seems incorrect to describe such a mother's goal as self-interested.

Psychological egoists, however, respond that helping others in such ways is ultimately motivated by some form of self-interest, such as non-sensory satisfaction, the expectation of reciprocation, the desire to gain respect or reputation, or by the expectation of a reward in a putative afterlife. The helpful action is merely instrumental to these ultimately selfish goals.

In the ninth century, Mohammed Ibn Al-Jahm [[Barmakids|Al-Barmaki]] (محمد بن الجـَهْم البَرمَكي) has been quoted saying:

"No one deserves thanks from another about something he has done for him or goodness he has done, he is either willing to get a reward from God, therefore he wanted to serve himself, or he wanted to get a reward from people, therefore, he has done that to get profit for himself, or to be mentioned and praised by people, therefore, to it is also for himself, or due to his mercy and tenderheartedness, so he has simply done that goodness to pacify these feelings and treat himself."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn-Qutaiba Al-Dainoori, "Taweel Mukhtalaf AlHadith" (interpretation of controversial Hadith), http://www.almeshkat.net/books/open.php?cat=9&amp;book=1150 (The book in Arabic). 
The quote in Arabic "لا يستحق أحد من أحد شكرا على شيء فعله به أو خير أسداه إليه لأنه لا يخلو أن يكون فعل ذلك طلبا للثواب من الله تعالى فإنما إلى نفسه قصد أو يكون فعله للمكافأة فإنه إلى الربح ذاهب أو يكون فعله للذكر والثناء ففي حظه سعي وفي حبله حطب أو فعله رحمة له ورقة وضعت في قلبه فإنما سكن بتلك العطية علته وداوى بها من دائه"&lt;/ref&gt;

This sort of explanation appears to be close to the view of [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]]&lt;ref&gt;[[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld, François de]] (1691). ''Moral Maxims and Reflections, in Four Parts''. London: Gillyflower, Sare, &amp; Everingham&lt;/ref&gt; (and perhaps Hobbes&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes, Thomas]] (1650). ''Human Nature'', public domain&lt;/ref&gt;).

According to psychological hedonism, the ultimate egoistic motive is to gain good feelings of pleasure and avoid bad feelings of pain.  Other, less restricted forms of psychological egoism may allow the ultimate goal of a person to include such things as avoiding punishments from oneself or others (such as guilt or shame) and attaining rewards (such as [[pride]], self-worth, power or reciprocal beneficial action).

Some psychologists explain [[empathy]] in terms of psychological hedonism. According to the "merge with others hypothesis", empathy increases the more an individual feels like they are one with another person, and decreases as the oneness decreases.&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, Robert B., S. L. Brown, B. P. Lewis, C. Luce, &amp; S. L. Neuberg (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, altruistic actions emanating from empathy and empathy itself are caused by making others' interests our own, and the satisfaction of their desires becomes our own, not just theirs.  Both [[Cognitive Psychology|cognitive]] studies and [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] experiments have provided evidence for this theory: as humans increase our oneness with others our empathy increases, and as empathy increases our inclination to act altruistically increases.&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, Robert B., S. L. Brown, B. P. Lewis, C. Luce, &amp; S. L. Neuberg (1997); Kaplan, J. T., &amp; Iacoboni, M. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Neuropsychological studies have linked [[mirror neuron]]s to humans experiencing empathy.  Mirror neurons are activated both when a human (or animal) performs an action and when they observe another human (or animal) performs the same action.  Researchers have found that the more these mirror neurons fire the more human subjects report empathy.  From a neurological perspective, scientists argue that when a human empathizes with another, the brain operates as if the human is actually participating in the actions of the other person.  Thus, when performing altruistic actions motivated by empathy, humans experience someone else's pleasure of being helped.  Therefore, in performing acts of altruism, people act in their own self interests even at a neurological level.

== Criticisms ==

=== Explanatory power ===
Even accepting the theory of universal positivity, it is difficult to explain, for example, the actions of a soldier who sacrifices his life by jumping on a grenade in order to save his comrades.  In this case, there is simply no time to experience positivity toward one's actions, although a psychological egoist may argue that the soldier experiences moral positivity in knowing that he is sacrificing his life to ensure the survival of his comrades, or that he is avoiding negativity associated with the thought of all his comrades dying.&lt;ref&gt;Shaver, Robert (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychological egoists argue that although some actions may not clearly cause physical nor social positivity, nor avoid negativity, one's current contemplation or reactionary mental expectation of these is the main factor of the decision.  When a dog is first taught to sit, it is given a biscuit.  This is repeated until, finally, the dog sits without requiring a biscuit.  Psychological egoists could claim that such actions which do not 'directly' result in positivity, or reward, are not dissimilar from the actions of the dog.  In this case, the action (sitting on command) will have become a force of habit, and breaking such a habit would result in mental discomfort.  This basic theory of conditioning behavior, applied to other seemingly ineffective positive actions, can be used to explain moral responses that are instantaneous and instinctive such as the soldier jumping on the grenade.

=== Circularity ===
Psychological egoism has been accused of being [[Begging the question|circular]]: "If a person willingly performs an act, that means he derives personal enjoyment from it; therefore, people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment."  In particular, seemingly altruistic acts must be performed because people derive enjoyment from them and are therefore, in reality, egoistic.  This statement is circular because its conclusion is identical to its hypothesis: it assumes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment, and concludes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment.  This objection was tendered by [[William Hazlitt]]&lt;ref&gt;Hazlitt (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Macaulay]]&lt;ref&gt;http://oll.libertyfund.org/Home3/Essay.php?recordID=1249&lt;/ref&gt; in the 19th century, and has been restated many times since.  An earlier version of the same objection was made by [[Joseph Butler]] in 1726.

[[Joel Feinberg]], in his [[1958 in literature|1958]] paper "Psychological Egoism", embraces a similar critique by drawing attention to the [[infinite regress]] of psychological egoism.  He expounds it in the following cross-examination:

:"All men desire only satisfaction."

:"Satisfaction of what?"

:"Satisfaction of their desires."

:"Their desires for what?"

:"Their desires for satisfaction."

:"Satisfaction of what?"

:"Their desires."

:"For what?"

:"For satisfaction"—etc., ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joel Feinberg|Feinberg, Joel]]. "Psychological Egoism." In ''Reason &amp; Responsibility: Readings in Some Basic Problems of Philosophy'', edited by Joel Feinberg and [[Russ Shafer-Landau]], 520-532. [[California]]: [[The Thomson Corporation|Thomson Wadsworth]], [[2008 in literature|2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolutionary argument ===
In their 1998 book, ''Unto Others'', Sober and Wilson detailed an evolutionary argument based on the likelihood for egoism to evolve under the pressures of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specifically, they focus on the human behavior of parental care. To set up their argument, they propose two potential psychological mechanisms for this. The hedonistic mechanism is based on a parent's ultimate desire for pleasure or the avoidance of pain and a belief that caring for its offspring will be instrumental to that. The altruistic mechanism is based on an altruistic ultimate desire to care for its offspring.

Sober and Wilson argue that when evaluating the likelihood of a given trait to evolve, three factors must be considered: availability, reliability and energetic efficiency. The genes for a given trait must first be ''available'' in the gene pool for selection. The trait must then ''reliably'' produce an increase in fitness for the organism. The trait must also operate with ''energetic efficiency'' to not limit the fitness of the organism. Sober and Wilson argue that there is neither reason to suppose that an altruistic mechanism should be any less available than a hedonistic one nor reason to suppose that the content of thoughts and desires (hedonistic vs. altruistic) should impact energetic efficiency. As availability and energetic efficiency are taken to be equivalent for both mechanisms it follows that the more reliable mechanism will then be the more likely mechanism.

For the hedonistic mechanism to produce the behavior of caring for offspring, the parent must believe that the caring behavior will produce pleasure or avoidance of pain for the parent. Sober and Wilson argue that the belief also must be true and constantly reinforced, or it would not be likely enough to persist. If the belief fails then the behavior is not produced. The altruistic mechanism does not rely on belief; therefore, they argue that it would be less likely to fail than the alternative, i.e. more reliable.

'''Queen Hyeondeok of the Andong Kwon Clan''' was the primary consort of [[Munjong of Joseon|the crown prince of Joseon]]. She died giving birth to the future [[Danjong of Joseon]] and was posthumously honoured as Queen Hyeondeok, later demoted by [[Sejo of Joseon]] after he deposed her son, then restored by [[Seongjong of Joseon]].

==Biography==
Lady Kwon entered the palace in 1431 alongside two other women, Lady Jang and Lady Hong. All were granted the rank of ''seunghwi'' consort ({{hangul|승휘}}).&lt;ref name=sejong51&gt;Veritable Records of Sejong, volume 51.&lt;/ref&gt; She gave birth to a daughter in either 1432 or 1433, but she died before she reached one year old.&lt;ref name=sejong59&gt;Veritable Records of Sejong, volume 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1435, Consort Kwon became pregnant, which drew the jealously of [[Sun-bin Bong|the crown princess]], who had no children and feared that she would be removed in favour of Kwon.&lt;ref name=sejong75&gt;Veritable Records of Sejong, volume 75.&lt;/ref&gt; She gave birth to [[Princess Gyeonghye]] in 1436. After Crown Princess Sun was banished for sleeping with her maid, officials suggested that Kwon be made the next crown princess, as she already had a child, was older than Lady Hong, and her father's government position was high. She was made Royal Noble Consort Kwon late in 1436.&lt;ref name=sejong75/&gt;

On 9 August 1441, Royal Noble Consort Kwon gave birth to a son named [[Danjong of Joseon|Hong-wi]], which was much celebrated, as he was [[Munjong of Joseon|the crown prince's]] only son. However, Kwon did not recover from the birth and died a day later. She was granted the posthumous title of Royal Noble Consort Hyeondeok ({{hanja|顯德}})&lt;ref name=sejong93&gt;Veritable Records of Sejong, volume 93.&lt;/ref&gt; and buried at Sorung ({{hanja|昭陵}}) in Ansan, [[Gyeonggi]].&lt;ref name=danjong3&gt;Veritable Records of Danjong, volume 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous status==
When [[Munjong of Joseon]] ascended the throne, he granted Kwon the title of Queen Hyeondeok.&lt;ref&gt;Veritable Records of Munjong, volume 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Her son bestowed a full posthumous name on her during his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Veritable Records of Danjong, volume 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1457, several years after [[Sejo of Joseon]] had deposed her son as king, Queen Hyeondeok's brother and his mother-in-law were found guilty of treason and executed. Both the queen and her father were posthumously demoted to [[Cheonmin|commoner status]].&lt;ref name=sejo8&gt;Veritable Records of Sejo, volume 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Her status was later restored and her remains were moved to [[Donggureung|Hyeonreung]] to be buried alongside [[Munjong of Joseon]].&lt;ref&gt;Veritable Records of Seongjong, volume 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Her full posthumous name==

*인효순혜현덕왕후
*仁孝順惠顯德王后

'''Richard L. Bliss''' is an [[United States|American]] engineer and former employee of [[Qualcomm]] who was arrested in November 1997 while working within [[Russia]] on charges of espionage. Bliss, who was using a [[global positioning system]] that he had illegally brought into the country, was arrested by Russian authorities who believed that he was using the GPS to plot the location of Russian military bases.&lt;ref name="release.07.12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arrest.02.12" /&gt; He was charged with espionage - a twenty-year prison sentence under Russian Criminal Code - however mounting diplomatic pressure from the American government, including President [[Bill Clinton]], then Vice-President [[Al Gore]] and U.S. Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]], led to Bliss being released at first temporarily in order to visit his family for the Christmas holiday, and then permanently when the charges were dismissed.

==Incident==

===Background===
Bliss, a resident of [[San Diego]] who grew up in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]], was working as a field technician for Qualcomm in late 1997, on a two-month stint in the area of Russian city [[Rostov-on-Don]].&lt;ref name="accuse.06.12" /&gt; It was his first trip overseas, having previously only travelled to [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Russia Says an American Accused of Espionage Can Return Home for the Holidays" /&gt; He was working, according to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', as "a supplier of communications equipment with Russian projects in Moscow, Rostov and Chelyabinsk."&lt;ref name="arrest.02.12"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/02/news/mn-59808 | title=Russians Hold Employee of San Diego Firm as Alleged Spy | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | accessdate=12 October 2013 | author=William, Carol J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Russian firms were at the time employing American technicians to modernise antiquated telecommunications in remote areas of Russia.&lt;ref name="Russia Says an American Accused of Espionage Can Return Home for the Holidays" /&gt; Qualcomm themselves stated following his detention that Bliss was "a Qualcomm employee installing a state-of-the art wireless local telephone system for the Rostov region."&lt;ref name="arrest.02.12" /&gt;

===Arrest===
In an operation by the Russian [[Federal Security Service]] in [[Rostov]] on November 25, Bliss was plotted by tracking the [[global positioning system]]s and wireless telephone that he was using. He was one of six suspects targeted for the "use of various satellite equipment that was illegally brought into Russia," and was arrested along with one of his co-workers. He was charged under Article 276 of the Russian Criminal Code, it being claimed that he was using the GPS system, which he had illegally brought into the country, to plot the location of Russian military bases.&lt;ref name="release.07.12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arrest.02.12" /&gt;

A week later, staff of the American Embassy in [[Moscow]] were permitted to attend to Bliss and offer him assistance. Qualcomm, based in [[San Diego]], issued a statement denying that Bliss was involved in espionage, while the U.S. Embassy stated that "These are private-sector American citizens who have no connection to the U.S. government and are certainly not spies."&lt;ref name="arrest.02.12" /&gt; Bliss' family also issued states, with his brother stating to the media that "We are deeply devastated by these absurd allegations."&lt;ref name="accuse.06.12" /&gt;

===Charge and conviction===

Bliss was formerly charged with espionage on December 6 after admitting bringing satellite equipment into the country illegally, though he denied all accusations of espionage.&lt;ref name="accuse.06.12"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/06/news/mn-61119 | title=Moscow Accuses American Worker of Spying | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | date=6 December 1997 | accessdate=12 October 2013 | author=Bennett, Vanora}}&lt;/ref&gt; His defence lawyer, a Russian solicitor named Valery Petryayev, dismissed the charges as illegal, stating that "Subjectively, he [Bliss] couldn't and didn't know that he was violating any laws. He is a technician who was told to go there and do that. So he went to carry out some tests, and he had no idea he was violating any laws."&lt;ref name="accuse.06.12" /&gt; Following growing American diplomatic pressure, the Russian government then chose to release Bliss the following day, December 7. He was required to remain in Rostov-on-Don, while American diplomats met with him and stated that he was in "good condition."&lt;ref name="release.07.12"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/07/news/mn-61748 | title=Russian Agency Releases American Accused of Spying | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | date=December 7, 1997 | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomatic pressure and release===
Meanwhile, American President [[Bill Clinton]], then Vice-President [[Al Gore]] and U.S. Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] all mounted pressure on the Russian government to release Bliss. On December 24 he was released from custody in order, according to Russian authorities, to return home for the Christmas holiday period. Bliss' lawyer, however, indicated to the media that the action was an admission by the Russian government that the arrest had been a mistake.&lt;ref name="release1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/24/news/mn-1836 | title=American Accused of Spying Leaves Russia | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian government was criticised from within its own quarters also, with high-ranking executives of several telephone companies complaining that "We ask these Westerners to come here to help us develop our communications, and then we arrest them for doing so."&lt;ref name="Russia Says an American Accused of Espionage Can Return Home for the Holidays"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/24/world/russia-says-an-american-accused-of-espionage-can-return-home-for-the-holidays.html | title=Russia Says an American Accused of Espionage Can Return Home for the Holidays | publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bliss received a warm welcome on his return to San Diego. "Hundreds" of Qualcomm co-workers met him at the airport.&lt;ref name="Co-Workers Welcome Man Accused by Russia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/30/news/mn-3523 | title=Co-Workers Welcome Man Accused by Russia | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rally was held in his name at Qualcomm's headquarters.&lt;ref name="Man Spends Holiday in U.S. After Arrest as Spy"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/28/us/man-spends-holiday-in-us-after-arrest-as-spy.html | title=Man Spends Holiday in U.S. After Arrest as Spy | publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was vocal about his innocence, stating that "my word is my bond."&lt;ref name="Russians Allow Accused Spy to Visit Home"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/26/news/mn-2361 | title=Russians Allow Accused Spy to Visit Home | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Bliss was required to return by January 11, 1998,&lt;ref name="release1" /&gt; however on January 8 the American government announced that Bliss did not have to return to Russia.&lt;ref name="U.S. Spying Suspect Won't Have to Return"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jan/08/news/mn-6192 | title=U.S. Spying Suspect Won't Have to Return | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert George Collier Proctor''' (13 May 1868 – 6 September 1903) was an [[English people|English]] [[bibliographer]], [[librarian]], [[book collector]], and expert on [[Incunable|incunabula]] and early [[typography]].

==Early life and education==
Proctor was born in [[Budleigh Salterton]], [[Devon]], [[England]], on 13 May 1868, to Robert Proctor and Anne Tate, and was a distant relative and [[namesake]] of [[John Payne Collier]].&lt;ref name=Johnson7&gt;{{cite book |first=Barry |last=Johnson |title=Lost in the Alps: A Portrait of Robert Proctor, the "Great Bibliographer" and of His Career in the British Museum |page=7 |location=London |publisher=B.C. Johnson |year=1985 |oclc=17484098}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[classics]] from [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], in 1890. While at Oxford, where he was known for his book collection, Proctor's interest in [[antiquarian]] studies, [[archaeology]], and bibliography grew and he compiled a catalogue of incunabula and early printed books in the library collection at Corpus Christi College. Proctor continued his studies of early printing at Oxford, cataloging incunabula at the [[Bodleian Library]], [[New College, Oxford|New College]] and [[Brasenose College]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{Cite ODNB |id=35621 |title=Proctor, Robert George Collier |first=Dennis E. |last=Rhodes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional life==
Proctor joined the [[British Museum]] on 16 October 1893 as an assistant in the Department of Printed Books. He quickly became an expert on early typography and began describing every known European type [[font|fount]] used before 1520.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pollard&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alfred W. |last=Pollard |title=Robert Proctor |journal=The Library |series=2nd Series |volume=5 |issue=17 |date=January 1904 |page=15 |doi=10.1093/library/s2-V.17.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proctor rearranged all of the incunabula in the British Museum geographically by place of printing in what is known today as "Proctor order" and he compiled ''An Index to the Early Printed Books in the British Museum: From the Invention of Printing to the Year 1500'' which was issued in four parts from 1898 to 1903.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; Proctor developed a [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[typeface]] based on type found in the [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible]].&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; Working with [[William Morris]] at the [[Kelmscott Press]], Proctor grew interested in [[Icelandic literature]] and published translations of the [[Vápnfirðinga saga]] and the [[Laxdæla saga]] in 1902 and 1903, respectively.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tale of the Weaponfirthers |others=Translated by Robert Proctor |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Printed by T. and A.

==Death==
In August 1903 Proctor began a solo walking tour in the [[Central Eastern Alps|Austrian Alps]]. He left [[Pitztal]] on 5 September without a guide and was never heard from again. In December 1903 a judge granted an order [[Declared death in absentia|presuming]] Proctor's death on 6 September of that year.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite book |first=Barry |last=Johnson |title=Lost in the Alps: A Portrait of Robert Proctor, the "Great Bibliographer" and of His Career in the British Museum |location=London |publisher=B.C. Johnson |year=1985 |oclc=17484098}}&lt;/ref&gt; His friend, [[Sydney Cockerell]], speculated that Proctor may have committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robert Proctor, William Morris and the Mysterious Death of 'the great bibliographer' |work=Special Collections and Archives (SCOLAR) |publisher=Cardiff University |date=11 June 2013 |url=http://scolarcardiff.wordpress.com/2013/06/11/robert-proctor-william-morris-and-the-mysterious-death-of-the-great-bibliographer/ |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After Proctor's death a memorial fund was established and used to collect and publish (in 1905) his ''Bibliographical Essays''. The fund also provided for the compilation and publication of the three remaining parts of Proctor's index of early printed books covering the years 1501 to 1520. Even today, some large collections of incunabula are arranged in "Proctor order" ("This means that the books are arranged and described in order of country of origin, then of town, then of printer, in chronological order").&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

The '''SS ''Ira H.

She was loaded with 116,000 bushels of barley which was considered a "light load". The ''Owen'''s sinking took the lives of 19 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==

The ''Ira H. Owen'' was a product of the Globe Iron Works Company of [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. She was launched on July 7, 1887 as hull #14 and entered service on July 28, 1887. She was one of the first steel-hulled [[Lake freighter|Great Lakes freighter]] to ply the lakes. She had a length of 278.3 feet, a beam of 39 feet and a height of 19 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also had two smokestacks.

On November 29, the ''Owen'' ran aground near the [[Soo Locks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |access-date=15 February 2018
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1892, the ''Owen'' collided with the two-masted [[schooner]] ''Belle Brown'' in a heavy fog about sixteen miles off [[Ludington, Michigan]]. In July 1897, the ''Owen'' collided with the steamer ''Susquehanna'' in heavy fog off [[Presque Isle, Wisconsin|Presque Isle Point]], [[Lake Huron]]. Both the ''Owen'' and the ''Susquehanna'' sustained severe damage. In December 1903, the ''Owen'' suffered a fire in her boiler room. She was bound from [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin]] to [[Buffalo, New York]] with a load of grain at the time the fire occurred. She was later towed to [[Sturgeon Bay]] for repairs by the tugboats ''Ann Arbor No. 1'', ''George Burnham'' and the ''Hyacinth''. In October 1904, the ''Owen'' was fully loaded with coal when she collided with the ''Henry W. Oliver'' in the [[St. Marys River (Indiana and Ohio)|St. Marys River]].

==Final voyage==
[[File:Ira H. Owen.png|thumb|Port side view of the ''Owen'']]
Author James M. Keller wrote about the final voyage of the ''Owen'' in his book The "Unholy Apostles":

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the morning of November 28, 1905 the ''Ira H. Owen'' left Duluth downbound with a load of barley. The weather was worsening as she passed the Apostles, but Captain Hulligan decided against seeking shelter at this point. As she was steaming by outer Island the furious gale picked up and started pounding the ''Owen'' mercilessly. Enormous seas swelled, temperatures dropped below zero, hurricane force winds whipped the driven snow -- and ''the Ira H. Owen'' found herself in open water with no place of refuge in sight. Desperately the brave crew fought the wild seas as best they could. At the height of the terrible storm Captain Alva Keller of the steamer ''Harold B. Nye'' spotted the ''Owen''. She appeared to be in dire straits and was constantly blowing distress signals, but the 380 foot ''Nye'' was in so much trouble herself that she couldn't possibly lend assistance. The dense snow squall then descended upon the ''Owen'', completely blocking her from Keller's view. The ''Nye'' continued to ride out the monstrous waves for two hours when slowly, the squall lifted and faint visibility was restored. Keller immediately grabbed his binoculars and pointed them in the direction where he last sighted the ''Owen''. Anxiously, tensely, he scanned the water, but saw nothing. The ''Ira H. Owen'' had vanished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keller|first=James M.|title=The Unholy Apostles|isbn=0-933577-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Today==
Although her wreck has not been located, according to the [[Wisconsin Historical Society]] the wreck of the ''Owen'' lies in deep water off Outer Island in the Apostles.&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinshipwrecks.org/Files/Wisconsins%20Historic%20Shipwrecks.pdf |title=Wisconsin’s Historic Shipwrecks-An Overview and Analysis of Locations for a State/Federal Partnership with the National Marine Sanctuary Program |work=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]] |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanislas Leibler''' (born 1957) is a Polish theoretical and experimental biologist and physicist.  He is [[Systems Biology]] Professor at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton and the Gladys T. Perkin Professor and Head of the Laboratory of Living Matter at the [[Rockefeller University]].

==Education and career==
Leibler did his undergraduate work in physics at the [[University of Warsaw]].  He received a Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 1981 and Ph.D. in physics in 1984, both at the [[University of Paris]].  He spent one year at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] and then from 1984 to 1992 he was a Research Fellow at the [[Saclay Nuclear Research Centre]]. From 1985 to 1987 he was a Visiting Research Associate at [[Cornell University]] and then from 1989 to 1991 at the [[ESPCI ParisTech]] in Paris.

He was a professor of physics at [[Princeton University]], becoming a Professor in the Department of Molecular Biology in 1993.  He was an Investigator at [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] (2000–2001), and  Tri-Institutional Professor at the [[Weill Cornell Medical College]] and the [[Sloan-Kettering Institute]] (2003–2010).  Since 2001 Leiber has been a Professor at [[The Rockefeller University]].  Stanislas Leibler joined the faculty of the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study on April 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ias.edu/news/press-releases/2009/1240345389 Stanislas Leibler Appointed to the Faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study], IAS press release, April 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibler deals both theoretically and experimentally with systems biology–the interaction of genetic and biochemical networks at the cellular level in living organisms and populations.  He and his colleagues have developed simple genetic networks in bacteria that act like clocks or logic circuits. A 2000 experiment with [[Michael Elowitz]] is considered one of the key results in [[synthetic biology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7279/full/463269b.html Editorial:  Ten years of synergy], Nature 463, 269-270 (21 January 2010),  doi:10.1038/463269b&lt;/ref&gt; They built a synthetic network to implement a particular function in [[E. coli]], namely a negative feedback system of gene regulation, and were able to monitor the system using [[Fluorescent protein|fluorescent dye proteins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v403/n6767/full/403335a0.html A synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators], Michael B. Elowitz &amp; Stanislas Leibler, Nature 403, 335-338 (20 January 2000), doi:10.1038/35002125&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibler was a 1997/98 [[Humboldt Research Award]] winner at the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBO) in [[Heidelberg]]. In 2015 he won the [[Max Delbruck Prize]] awarded by the [[American Physical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201503/upload/2015-Prizes-Awards.pdf American Physical Society announces 2015 Prize &amp; Award Recipients], 2015 Max Delbruck PrizeIn Biological Physics&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016 he was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/may-3-2016-NAS-Election.html|title=National Academy of Sciences Members and Foreign Associates Elected|department=News from the National Academy of Sciences|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|date=May 3, 2016|accessdate=2016-05-14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the surgical stress response can be used for evaluation of surgical techniques and comparisons of different anaesthetic protocols. Moreover, they can be performed both in the intraoperative or postoperative period. 
If there is a choice between different techniques for a surgical procedure, one method to evaluate and compare the surgical techniques is to subject one group of patients to one technique, and the other group of patients to another technique, after which the surgical stress responses triggered by the procedures are compared. The technique with the least surgical stress response is considered the best for the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freeman|first=LJ|author2=Rahmani, EY |author3=Al-Haddad, M |author4=Sherman, S |author5=Chiorean, MV |author6=Selzer, DJ |author7=Snyder, PW |author8= Constable, PD |title=Comparison of pain and postoperative stress in dogs undergoing natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, laparoscopic, and open oophorectomy.|journal=Gastrointestinal Endoscopy|date=Aug 2010|volume=72|issue=2|pages=373–80|pmid=20537637 |doi=10.1016/j.gie.2010.01.066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Höglund|first=Odd Viking|title=A resorbable device for ligation of blood vessels : development, assessment of surgical procedures and clinical evaluation|year=2012|isbn=978-91-576-7686-3|url=http://pub.epsilon.slu.se/8589/1/odd_v_hoglund_120210..pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Höglund|first=OV|author2=Olsson, K |author3=Hagman, R |author4=Öhlund, M |author5=Olsson, U |author6= Lagerstedt, AS |title=Comparison of haemodynamic changes during two surgical methods for neutering female dogs.|journal=Research in veterinary science|date=Aug 2011|volume=91|issue=1|pages=159–63|pmid=20888021 |doi=10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.08.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kataja|first=J|author2=Chrapek, W |author3=Kaukinen, S |author4=Pimenoff, G |author5= Salenius, JP |title=Hormonal stress response and hemodynamic stability in patients undergoing endovascular vs. conventional abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Surgery|year=2007|volume=96|issue=3|pages=236–42|pmid=17966750}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ledowski|first=T|author2=Bein, B |author3=Hanss, R |author4=Paris, A |author5=Fudickar, W |author6=Scholz, J |author7= Tonner, PH |title=Neuroendocrine stress response and heart rate variability: a comparison of total intravenous versus balanced anesthesia.|journal=Anesthesia and Analgesia|date=Dec 2005|volume=101|issue=6|pages=1700–5|pmid=16301244 |doi=10.1213/01.ane.0000184041.32175.14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Naitoh|first=T|author2=Garcia-Ruiz, A |author3=Vladisavljevic, A |author4=Matsuno, S |author5= Gagner, M |title=Gastrointestinal transit and stress response after laparoscopic vs conventional distal pancreatectomy in the canine model.|journal=Surgical endoscopy|date=Nov 2002|volume=16|issue=11|pages=1627–30|pmid=12073003 |doi=10.1007/s00464-002-0007-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Veenhof, AA;

== Methods ==

Examples of used parameters are [[blood pressure]], [[heart rate]], [[heart rate variability]], [[photoplethysmography]] and [[skin conductance]]. Essentially, physiologic parameters are measured in order to assess sympathetic tone as a surrogate measure of stress. [[Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring]] can also be used.
Examples of commonly used biomarkers are [[adrenaline]], [[cortisol]], [[interleukin]]s, [[noradrenaline]] and [[vasopressin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höglund|first1=OV|last2=Hagman|first2=R|last3=Olsson|first3=K|last4=Olsson|first4=U|last5=Lagerstedt|first5=AS|title=Intraoperative Changes in Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Plasma Vasopressin, and Urinary Noradrenalin During Elective Ovariohysterectomy in Dogs: Repeatability at Removal of the 1st and 2nd Ovary.|journal=Veterinary surgery : VS|date=Aug 8, 2014|pmid=25130060|doi=10.1111/j.1532-950X.2014.12264.x|volume=43|pages=852–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joris|first1=JL|last2=Chiche|first2=JD|last3=Canivet|first3=JL|last4=Jacquet|first4=NJ|last5=Legros|first5=JJ|last6=Lamy|first6=ML|title=Hemodynamic changes induced by laparoscopy and their endocrine correlates: effects of clonidine.|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|date=November 1998|volume=32|issue=5|pages=1389–96|pmid=9809953|doi=10.1016/s0735-1097(98)00406-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Loss of nitrogen (urea) was observed already in the 1930s in fracture patients by the Scottish physician [[David Cuthbertson]]. The reason for the patients' catabolic response was not understood at the time, but later attention was turned to the stress reaction caused by the surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cuthbertson|first=DP|title=The disturbance of metabolism produced by bony and non-bony injury, with notes on certain abnormal conditions of bone.|journal=The Biochemical Journal|year=1930|volume=24|issue=4|pages=1244–63|pmid=16744448|pmc=1254622|doi=10.1042/bj0241244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilmore|first=DW|title=From Cuthbertson to fast-track surgery: 70 years of progress in reducing stress in surgical patients.|journal=Annals of Surgery|date=Nov 2002|volume=236|issue=5|pages=643–8|pmid=12409671|doi=10.1097/00000658-200211000-00015|pmc=1422623}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The evolutionary background is believed to be that a wounded animal increases its chance of survival by using stored energy reserves. The stress reaction thus initiates a catabolic state by an increased release of catabolic hormones. Additionally immunosuppressive hormones are also released. 
In a surgery patient, the stress reaction is considered detrimental for wound healing. However, surgical stress reduced mortality from endotoxin shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kamei|first1=K|last2=Nimura|first2=Y|last3=Nagino|first3=M|last4=Aono|first4=K|last5=Nakashima|first5=I|title=Surgical stress reduces mortality from endotoxin shock.|journal=Langenbeck's archives of surgery / Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Chirurgie|date=January 2002|volume=386|issue=7|pages=512–7|pmid=11819109|doi=10.1007/s00423-001-0261-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, development of new surgical techniques and anaesthetic protocols aim to minimise the surgical stress reaction.

'''The Bolney Torso''' refers to the partial remains of an unknown male decedent that were discovered in woods near [[Bolney]], [[Southern England]] in October of 1991. 

== Discovery of the body ==
On Friday 11 October 1991 Colin Oliver, then 62,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/6712688._Bolney_torso__riddle_still_baffles_police/|title='Bolney torso' riddle still baffles police|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered the torso in woods off Broxmead Lane in [[Bolney]], [[Sussex]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-15256742|title=New clues in headless man inquiry|date=2011-10-11|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9298428.New_clues_in_Bolney_Torso_mystery/|title=New clues in Bolney Torso mystery|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver was walking home to [[Burgess Hill]] from [[Cuckfield]] along Broxfield Lane. Oliver stopped along the lane and went though a gate leading to a field.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.midsussextimes.co.uk/news/crime/headless-murder-mystery-why-the-bolney-torso-killing-in-sussex-is-still-unsolved-27-years-later-1-8675361|title=Headless murder mystery – why the ‘Bolney Torso’ killing in Sussex is still unsolved 27 years later|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver went into the trees to urinate and found a bloody torso rolled up in a piece of carpet in undergrowth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Oliver then walked to the Burgess Hill police station to alert the police to his discovery.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Oliver claimed to have been so disturbed by the discovery that he had trouble sleeping for several months after.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Initial description of victim ===
The remains were found to be of a male who was believed to have been in his 60s at the time of death.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The head and hands of the victim had been removed &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.midsussextimes.co.uk/news/video-new-information-about-the-bolney-torso-1-685080|title=Video: New information about the Bolney torso|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and the severed head and limbs were never found.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One arm had been severed six inches below the elbow and the other two inches below the elbow, this appeared to have been done in order to remove an identifying tattoo.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The arms and appeared to have been removed with an [[axe]] or [[bolt cropper]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The victim was described as white, had a protruding belly&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; was circumcised and had a small star-shaped mole on his right thigh.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The victim was wearing turned up trousers from Fosters&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.midsussextimes.co.uk/news/police-check-new-leads-after-bolney-torso-television-appeal-1-686639|title=Police check new leads after Bolney torso television appeal|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a blue shirt with a distinctive motif on the pocket.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Investigation ==
The investigation to find the identity of the victim and the murder was assigned the name Operation A23 and employed 60 people and cost £150,000.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Detective Chief Inspector|DCI]] Peter Kennett led the initial inquiry.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Detectives searched files of over 100 missing men without finding a match and appeals for the public to come forward with an identity were fruitless.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Suspects ===
In December 1991 police were contacted by a local estate agent with a potential lead; a large rented house in Copyhold Lane, [[Cuckfield]], (1.5 miles from the deposition location of the body) had been abandoned which raised their suspicions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Police investigated the property and found a copy of [[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]] magazine containing an article about dismembering bodies with numbers scrawled on the pages.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Gunter Josef Knieper, from [[Dresden]], [[Germany]], and Kornelia Maria Teusel first rented the property in September 1991 paying £10,000 (6 months rent) in advance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The couple abandoned the property some time around 9 October 1991. Knieper, who had been using the pseudonym Dr Matthias Herrman, was being sought in Germany and Ireland on suspicion of business fraud.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In June 1992 Knieper was arrested in [[Spain]]. Police interviewed Knieper in [[Frankfurt]] and established that the gang intended to start a fraud operation but Knieper denied any involvement in the murder of the victim.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In August 1992 police admitted there was no evidence to link Knieper to the murder.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In January 1994 police returned to Germany to interview another unnamed  male who had visited the property in Copyhold Lane.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Burial ===
On 2 August 1994, after a brief service,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;, the remains of the victim were laid to rest at Western Road Cemetery, in [[Haywards Heath]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The coffin bore the name "Unknown Male"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Eight people attended the [[Pauper's funeral|paupers funera]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l paid for by [[Mid Sussex District Council]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The mourners in attendance were representatives of the police, coroner's office and Mid Sussex District Council.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Subsequent events ===
In December 1995, a few days before Christmas, some flowers and a note were left at the victim’s grave. The note bore the message: "''For the unknown male, Peter and team, remember our loss.''"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Re-investigation ==
In March 2009 police exhumed the body in the hope that advances in forensic techniques would provide additional information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On 12 November 2009 the case appeared on the [[BBC]] program [[Crimewatch]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In 2010 it was reported that, following media appeals on UK Crimewatch and its German equivalent, numerous suggestions for the victim’s identity had been received however, none bore fruit. Police stated that three missing persons had been discounted as the identity of the victim and their families had been informed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/8151356.Three_men_ruled_out_of_Bolney_torso_case/|title=Three men ruled out of Bolney torso case|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 it was revealed that evidence gathered in 2010 indicated that the victim had been dressed post mortem&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and that the clothes did not belong to the victim.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The re-investigation examined a femur, rib bone and toenail from the victim. This revealed that the victim likely came from Southern Germany or a surrounding country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Analysis of the toenail suggested that the victim spent the last year of his life in the UK or the French/German border.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Revised description of the victim ===
The revised description of the victim was that his height was between 5 ft 6 and 5 ft 8 tall and aged between 30 - 45&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and most likely in his late 30s at the time of death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The victim had a strongly built upper body&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Analysis of the skeleton indicated that the victim was strong, well-nourished and healthy at the time of his death and he had no signs of any degenerative illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/4735827.Sussex_Police_still_trying_to_solve_riddle_of_headless_body/|title=Sussex Police still trying to solve riddle of headless body|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Montreal]], the son of Charles Walkem, and was educated at [[McGill University]],&lt;ref name="gemmill"/&gt; graduating in 1873. While a student, he worked as a reporter for Montreal newspapers. After graduating, Walkem went to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and tried unsuccessfully to join [[Carlism|Carlist]] supporters fighting in Spain.
