'''BG Voz''' (stylized as '''BG:Voz'''; {{lang-sr-cyr|БГ Вoз}}) is an urban rail system that serves the city of [[Belgrade]], Serbia. It is operated by the public transit corporation [[GSP Belgrade]] and is a part of the integrated [[BusPlus]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.expatserbia.com/once-youre-here/public-transport/413-bg-voz |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905111325/http://www.expatserbia.com/once-youre-here/public-transport/413-bg-voz |archive-date=September 5, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lines in service==
===Line 1===
{{BG Voz Line 1}}
BG:Voz began service between [[New Belgrade]] and [[Pančevo Bridge]] stations on September 1, 2010. Starting from April 15, 2011, the line has been extended westward to [[Batajnica]]. Further extension across the Danube, towards Krnjača and Ovča in 2016, was financed from the [[RZD International]] credit. The total travel time between the first and the last stop is 50 minutes. At peak times, trains run every 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zeleznicesrbije.com/active/sr-latin/home/glavna_navigacija/bg_voz_novi_gradski_prevoz.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717110734/http://www.zeleznicesrbije.com/active/sr-latin/home/glavna_navigacija/bg_voz_novi_gradski_prevoz.html |archive-date=July 17, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{BG Voz Line 2}}
The second line, between [[Prokop railway station|Belgrade Center]] and [[Resnik railway station|Resnik]], began revenue operations on April 13, 2018. Service frequency is one train every hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infrazs.rs/2018/04/bg-vozovi-izmedju-resnika-i-beograd-centra-redovni/ БГ возови између Ресника и Београд Центра редовни]&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that, beginning in mid-2018, some trains from the first line would be re-directed to line 2 (due to announced Belgrade-Budapest railroad reconstruction). Additionally, this line would be extended towards Ovča in order to partially compensate for the reductions in service on the first line. However, due to the nature of [[Belgrade railway junction]], it would temporarily bypass the Belgrade Center station.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.busevi.com/glas-putnika/pitanje-prijava-predlog-informacija/od-13-04-2018-pocinje-sa-radom-druga-linija-bgvoz-a-na-relaciji-resnik-zel-st-beograd-centar/?show_answer=30330  Od 13.04.2018. počinje sa radom druga linija BG:voz-a na relaciji “Resnik – Žel.St. /Beograd centar/” ]&lt;/ref&gt;
The line currently has only 5 stations:

The '''flag of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic''' flag shows a yellow [[hammer and sickle]] and outlined star on a red field above rippling water at the bottom,&lt;ref&gt;''Guide to the Flags of the World'' by Mauro Talocci, revised and updated by Whitney Smith ({{ISBN|0-688-01141-1}}), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; and was adopted by the (former) [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic]] on January 17, 1953.

==History==
The first socialist Latvian state, the [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic]], shown a red flag with the inscription ''LSPR''.

Prior to this, from 25 August 1940, the flag was red with the gold hammer and sickle in the top-left corner, with the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] characters ''LPSR'' (''Latvijas Padomju Sociālistiskā Republika'') above them in gold in a serif font.

The Soviet-era flag was officially replaced on 27 February 1990, when the national [[Flag of Latvia]] was reintroduced (while remained legally as a Soviet republic until 6 September 1991), and its use at public events is now banned.&lt;ref&gt;https://themoscowtimes.com/news/latvia-bans-soviet-symbols-25182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''General Federation of Workers Trade Unions in Bahrain''' (GFWTUB) is a national [[trade union]] federation in [[Bahrain]]. It was established in 2002 when the King created the [[Workers Trade Union Law]] granting workers the right to organize collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | year = 2005
 | title = Trade Unions of the World

 | edition = 6th
 | publisher = John Harper Publishing
 | location = London, UK
 | isbn = 0-9543811-5-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]]' Annual Survey 2005 highlighted: "Bahrain, a bright spot in an otherwise dismal landscape of persistent labour rights violations in the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title=Bahrain, a bright spot...
 | work=ICFTU Online
 | url=http://www.icftu.org/displaydocument.asp?Index=991222886&amp;Language=EN
 | accessdate=2006-10-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ICFTU:

:''Bahrain has set the standard for the Gulf region in terms of positive developments. The right to form trade unions has existed since 2002, although only one national trade union centre is recognised, and other rights are still limited. The General Federation of Bahrain Trade Unions held its founding congress in January 2004 and in December became the first organisation in the Gulf States to become a member of the ICFTU. It has been actively involved in tripartite discussions, including on labour legislation.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title=Bahrain: Annual Survey of Violations of Trade Union Rights (2005)
 | work=ICFTU Online
 | url=http://www.icftu.org/displaydocument.asp?Index=991222248&amp;Language=EN
 | accessdate=2006-10-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|King Hamad]] signed a law banning the sacking of employees engaged in trade union activities. Under an amended law, the courts must reinstate a sacked worker and award them compensation if it is proved that they were sanctioned for such activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title=Sackings banned
 | work=Gulf Daily News
 | url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=159050&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=29211
 | accessdate=2006-10-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The King's move follows criticism by the ICTFU of the sacking in July 2005 of [[Gulf Air]]'s trade union head shortly after his election.

The establishment of the Federation was part of a number of key labour reforms introduced under the Minister of Labour, [[Majeed Al Alawi]].

The '''Great Bridge of Hrazdan''' ({{lang-hy|Հրազդանի Մեծ կամուրջ}}), more commonly known as '''Kievian Bridge''' ({{lang-hy|Կիևյան կամուրջ}}), is an [[arch bridge]] for traffic linking across the [[Hrazdan River]] in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]]. It connects the Kievian street of [[Arabkir district]] with the Leningradian street of [[Ajapnyak District]]. It was designed by architect [[Grigor Aghababyan]] and constructed between 1949 and 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yerevan.am/edfiles/files/ANDZNAGIR/kamurjner+.pdf Bridges in Yerevan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armmonuments.am/pages.php?al=home&amp;id=6942&amp;act1=more&amp;act=filter&amp;mtype=0&amp;region=9&amp;searchword=%D5%84%D4%B1%D5%85%D5%90 Great Bridge of Hrazdan at armmonuments.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Karen Demirchyan Complex]] and the [[Tumanyan Park]] are located around the bridge.

The '''Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration''' was an era which began at the end of the 19th century,  and ended after the [[First World War]]; the [[Shackleton–Rowett Expedition]] of 1921–22 is often cited by historians as the dividing line between the "Heroic" and "Mechanical" ages.&lt;ref name="Fisherlate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 414&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The historian [[Aant Elzinga]] gives the much later date of 1945, considering [[World War II]] to be the turning point in Antarctic research.{{cite book|first= Aang|last= Elzinga|title= Changing Trends in Antarctic Research|publisher= Springer|year= 1993|location= Dordrecth|isbn= 978-0-58-528849-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Heroic Age the [[Antarctic]] continent became the focus of  international efforts that resulted in intensive scientific and geographical exploration,   in which 17 major [[List of Antarctic expeditions|Antarctic expeditions]] were launched from ten countries.&lt;ref name= B19&gt;Barczewski, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The common factor in these expeditions was the limited nature of the resources available to them before advances in [[Transport in Antarctica|transport]] and [[Telecommunications in Antarctica|communication technologies]] revolutionized the work of exploration.&lt;ref name= Fisherlate/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, p. 691&amp;nbsp;– "before machines took over."&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that each expedition became a feat of endurance that tested, and sometimes exceeded its personnel's physical and mental limits. The "heroic" label, bestowed later, recognized the adversities which had to be overcome by these pioneers, some of whom did not survive the experience; during this period 19 expedition members died.

During the course of these expeditions the [[Geographical pole|geographical]] and [[South Magnetic Pole|magnetic poles]] were both reached.  The achievement of being first to the geographical [[South Pole]] was a primary object in some expeditions, and was the sole rationale for [[Roald Amundsen]]'s venture. However, this was not the only aspect of polar exploration during this time; other expeditions worked with defined objectives in different areas of the continent. As a result of all this activity, much of the continent's coastline was discovered and mapped, and significant areas of its interior were explored. The expeditions also generated large quantities of scientific data and specimens across a wide range of scientific disciplines, the examination and analysis of which would keep the world's scientific communities busy for decades.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the scientific results of the [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]], 1902–04 were still being published in 1920 (Speak, p. 100). 25 volumes of results from the [[Terra Nova Expedition]], 1910–13 had been published by 1925.

	The exploration of the South Pole has been an off and on area of focus; this particular period, the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, is not the first intensive period of Antarctic exploration. Curtailing what is commonly known as the [[Age of Exploration]], British explorer [[James Cook]] would be one of the few explorers who would travel to that Southern region of the world. The discoveries of [[Second voyage of James Cook|his second voyage]] (1772–1775) would change the global map forever.&lt;ref name="Kaye 1969"&gt;{{cite book|first= I.|last= Kaye|title= Captain James Cook and the Royal Society |publisher= Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 24, No.1|year= 1969|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his expedition it was believed that a large continent known as ''[[Terra Australis]]'' occupied the majority of the Southern hemisphere. However, Cook discovered that no such land mass existed though massive ice floes prevented his reaching Antarctica proper.&lt;ref name="Kaye 1969"/&gt; He did hypothesize that, based upon the amount of ice, there must be an originating land mass.&lt;ref name="Kaye 1969"/&gt; Subsequently, exploration of the Southern regions of the world came to a great halt. 
	However, a period of interest arose again between 1819 and 1843.&lt;ref name="American Association for the Advancement of Science 1887"&gt;{{cite book|last= American Association for the Advancement of Science |title= The Exploration of the Antarctic Regions|publisher= Science, Vol. 9, No. 223|year= 1887|location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Europe settled after a period of revolution, war, and unrest, explorers [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen|Bellingshausen]], [[John Biscoe|Biscoe]], [[John Balleny|Balleny]], [[Charles Wilkes]], [[Jules Dumont d'Urville|Dumont D'Urville]], and [[James Clark Ross]] sought greater knowledge of the Antarctic regions.&lt;ref name="American Association for the Advancement of Science 1887"/&gt; The primary goal of these explorers was to penetrate the ice walls that hid Antarctica proper, beginning with Bellingshausen's circumnavigation of the region, D'Urville's discovery of the first rocky land formation, and culminating in Wilkes's discovery of Victoria Land, featuring the volcanoes now known as Mt. Terror and Mt. Erebus.&lt;ref name="American Association for the Advancement of Science 1887"/&gt; These explorers, despite their impressive contributions to South Polar exploration, were unable to penetrate the interior of the continent and, rather, formed a broken line of discovered lands along the coastline of Antarctica.

What followed this period of Antarctic interest is what historian [[Hugh Robert Mill|H. R. Mill]] called 'the age of averted interest'.&lt;ref name="Fogg 2000"&gt;{{cite book|first= G.E.|last= Fogg|title= The Royal Society and the Antarctic|publisher= Notes and Records of the Royal Society London, Vol. 54, No. 1|year= 2000|location= London, The Royal Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the expedition South by the ships [[HMS Erebus (1826)|HMS ''Erebus'']] and [[HMS Terror (1813)|HMS ''Terror'']] under James Clark Ross (January, 1841), he suggested that there were no scientific discoveries, or 'problems', worth exploration in the far South.&lt;ref name="Fogg 2000"/&gt; It is considered that Ross' influence, as well as the loss of the [[Franklin expedition]] in the Arctic, led to disinterest in polar inquiry, particularly by The Royal Society: the British-founded organization that helped oversee many Arctic explorations, including those that would be made by Shackleton and Scott. However, in the following twenty years after Ross' return, there is a general lull internationally in Antarctic exploration.&lt;ref name="Fogg 2000"/&gt;

[[File:SirJMurrayatwork.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sir John Murray|alt=An old bearded man drawing or measuring with a compass.]] 
The initial impetus for the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration is somewhat contested as it is a vague international movement. George von Neumayer of Hamburg, also an Antarctic explorer, worked to renew Antarctic exploration in 1861 onwards as he worked in an observatory in Melbourne.&lt;ref name="American Association for the Advancement of Science 1887"/&gt; His particular interests were the importance of meteorology and how more information of the South Pole could lead to more accurate weather predictions. This helps explain German involvement in Antarctic research. Another, particularly British, impetus more closely tied to the period  is a lecture given by [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Dr. John Murray]] entitled "The Renewal of Antarctic Exploration", given to the Royal Geographical Society in London, November 27, 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= John|last= Murray|title= The Renewal of Antarctic Exploration|publisher= The Geographical Journal, Vol. 3, No. 1|year= 1894|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray advocated that research into the Antarctic should be organised to "resolve the outstanding geographical questions still posed in the south".&lt;ref&gt;Crane, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Royal Geographic Society instated an Antarctic Committee shortly prior to this, in 1887, which successfully incited many whalers to explore the Southern regions of the world and foregrounded the lecture given by Murray.&lt;ref name="American Association for the Advancement of Science 1887"/&gt; In August 1895 the Sixth International Geographical Congress in London passed a general resolution calling on scientific societies throughout the world to promote the cause of Antarctic exploration "in whatever ways seem to them most effective".&lt;ref name= Borchbook9&gt;{{cite book|author = Borchgrevink, Carstens|title= ''First on the Antarctic Continent|url= https://books.google.com/?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Southern+Cross+Expedition|publisher = George Newnes Ltd|year= 1901|accessdate=11 August 2008|isbn = 978-0-90-583841-0}} pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Such work would "bring additions to almost every branch of science".&lt;ref name= Borchbook9/&gt; The Congress had been addressed by the Norwegian [[Carsten Borchgrevink]], who had just returned from a whaling expedition during which he had become one of the first to set foot on the Antarctic mainland. During his address, Borchgrevink outlined plans for a full-scale pioneering Antarctic expedition, to be based at [[Cape Adare]].&lt;ref name= Borchbook4&gt;{{cite book|author = Borchgrevink, Carstens|title= ''First on the Antarctic Continent|url= https://books.google.com/?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Southern+Cross+Expedition|publisher = George Newnes Ltd|year= 1901|accessdate=11 August 2008|isbn = 978-0-90-583841-0}} pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Heroic Age was inaugurated by an expedition launched by the Belgian Geographical Society in 1897; Borchgrevink followed a year later with a privately sponsored expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some histories consider the ''Discovery'' expedition, which departed in 1901, as the first proper expedition of the Heroic Age. See {{cite web|title= Mountaineering and Polar Collection – Antarctica|url= http://www.nls.uk/collections/foreign/mountains/antarctica-2.html|publisher= National Library of Scotland|accessdate= 19 November 2008|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090623023005/http://www.nls.uk/collections/foreign/mountains/antarctica-2.html|archivedate= 23 June 2009|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designation "heroic age" came later; the term is not used in any of the early expedition accounts or memoirs, nor in the biographies of polar figures which appeared in the 1920s and 1930s. It is not clear when the term was first coined or adopted generally; it was used in March 1956 by the British explorer [[Duncan Carse]], writing in ''[[The Times]]''. Describing the first crossing of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] in 1916, he wrote of "three men from the heroic age of Antarctic exploration, with 50&amp;nbsp;feet of rope between them, and a carpenter's adze".&lt;ref&gt;Carse, quoted by M. and J. Fisher, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the Heroic Age==
There are different views about when the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration came to an end.

Gadgets! Gadgets everywhere!".&lt;ref name= Fisherlate/&gt; These included wireless, an electrically heated crow's nest and an "odograph" that could trace and record the ship's route and speed.&lt;ref name= Fisherlate/&gt;

{{quote |
The heroic era of Antarctic exploration was ‘heroic’ because it was anachronistic before it began, its goal was as abstract as a pole, its central figures were romantic, manly and flawed, its drama was moral (for it mattered not only what was done but how it was done), and its ideal was national honour. It was an early testing-ground for the racial virtues of new nations such as Norway and Australia, and it was the site of Europe’s last gasp before it tore itself apart in the Great War.

'''KZKZ''' (729&amp;nbsp;kHz [[AM broadcasting|AM]]) was the second [[radio station]] in the [[Philippines]]. It began broadcasting in 1922 and was founded by Henry Hermann, the owner of the Electrical Supply Company in [[Manila]]. The station was upgraded in 1924 to a 100-watt station and its call letters KZKZ were adopted. Later that year, the station was sold to the [[Radio Corporation of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=613920&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=51 Juan De La Cruz tunes in - The Freeman (retrieved on September 21, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first radio broadcast in the Philippines was made in 1922 from Nichols air field by using a five-watt transmitter.

In 1926, the organization began work on constructing two of the largest radio stations in Asia with the idea of maintaining direct Manila-San Francisco service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,880868,00.html Time Magazine, September 20, 1926]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MTI Commemorative Medal, Budapest 2006.jpeg|right|thumb|Commemorative medal issued on the 125th anniversary of the founding of MTI.]]

'''MTI''' (''Magyar Távirati Iroda'', literally "Hungarian Telegraphic Office") is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[news agency]]. One of the oldest news agencies in the world, it was founded in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About MTI|url=http://www.mti.hu/fixcikk/124|work=MTI|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205004311/http://mti.hu/fixcikk/124|archivedate=5 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTI is owned by MTI Rt., founded by the Parliament.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; The members of the Owners’ Advisory Body are elected by the [[National Assembly of Hungary]] on four-year terms.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; It's a marketleader, and is considered by some sources to be a ‘balanced and reliable source’.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; Still, it finds it difficult to raise subscriptions as most major Hungarian newspapers are foreign-owned.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; It must turn to the government for capital to overcome its technology deficit.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;

According to a [[UNESCO]] report it faces competition both from independent and specialist news agencies (e.g. English-language on-line news sites, including the Budapest Business Journal, [[The Budapest Sun]], websites of various television and radio stations), and from domestic Hungarian news services established by [[Reuters]] and [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]].&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report of the Workshop on News Agencies in the Era of the Internet|url=http://www.unesco.org/webworld/publications/news_agencies/news_agencies.pdf|work=[[UNESCO]]|format=pdf|pages=53|date=January 2001|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2015, Magyar Távirati Iroda as well as the three other public media organizations managed by the MTVA were merged into a single organization called {{Interlanguage link multi|Duna Media Service|hu|3=Duna Médiaszolgáltató}} ({{lang-hu|Duna Médiaszolgáltató}}).&lt;ref name="MTVA/Duna Media Service Announcement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungarian public service media companies merge - MTVA|url=http://media-akademia.hu/mtva-press-news/212-hungarian-public-service-media-companies-merge|publisher=Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (MTVA)|accessdate=23 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222144948/http://media-akademia.hu/mtva-press-news/212-hungarian-public-service-media-companies-merge|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Neste barco à vela"''' ("In this sailing boat") was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1987]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by [[Nevada (Portuguese band)|Nevada]].

The song is in praise of Portugal itself. The two singers describe their "overfull boat" which apparently has a "childish look" as travelling on a "path of hope".

The song was performed eighth on the night, following [[Italy]]'s [[Umberto Tozzi]] and [[Raffaele Riefoli|Raf]] with "[[Gente di mare]]" and preceding [[Spain]]'s [[Patricia Kraus]] with "[[No estás solo]]". At the close of voting, it had received 15 points, placing 18th in a field of 22.

It was succeeded as [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portuguese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988 Contest]] by [[Dora (singer)|Dora]] with "[[Voltarei]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1721">The '''Pomerania euroregion''' or '''EUROREGION POMERANIA''' was set up in 1995 as one of the [[euroregion]]s, thought to connect regions divided between states of the [[European Union]]. The name is taken from the region of [[Pomerania]], yet the euroregion is of a different shape than the historical region. It comprises German [[Western Pomerania]] and [[Uckermark]], Polish [[Zachodniopomorskie]], and [[Scania]] in [[Sweden]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3556">In [[international finance]], the '''redundancy problem''', also known as the '''n &amp;minus; 1 problem''', is a problem of inequality of the number of policy instruments and the number of targets at the international level,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

This problem does not occur at the one-country level.&lt;ref name = "Gandolfo 1995"&gt;{{citation

Suppose the number of countries in the world is ''n''. Because this world is closed, one country's [[balance of payments]] surplus must be equal to another's deficit, and vice versa. Thus the sum of all countries' net payments positions must be zero. Therefore, if ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 countries out of ''n'' countries have determined their balances of payments, that of the ''n''th country is determined automatically.&lt;ref name = "Alan 2002"&gt;{{citation
 | author = Alan Professor Winters
 | page = 397
 | location = 
 | publisher = Routledge
 | title = International Economics
 | year = 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This fact implies that, if all of the ''n'' countries have payments objectives, only ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 countries can achieve the payments objectives. In other words, all of the payments objectives can not be achieved simultaneously.

Similarly, if there are ''n'' [[currency|currencies]] in the world, only ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 [[exchange rate]]s can be "independent" because the exchange rate is a price of one money relative to another.&lt;ref name = "Alan 2002" /&gt; Other rates which are not independent are calculated as [[cross rate]]. 

There are only ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 countries  to be determined, which implies the ''n'' th country is required to refrain from intervening its exchange rate. [[Benign neglect]] is one example for this fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Winthrop Jones, Peter B.

[[File:Azadistadium.jpg|thumb|Azadi Stadium in Iran]]

The [[Asian Football Confederation]] was founded in 1954.

The AFC members are split into five regional federations: [[West Asian Football Federation|West]], [[Central Asian Football Association|Central]], [[South Asian Football Federation|South]], [[East Asian Football Federation|East]] and [[ASEAN Football Federation|South East]]. These federations organize regional football championships.

The most successful Asian countries in international men's competitions have been Japan and South Korea in East, and Saudi Arabia and Iran in the West. In women's football, East Asian have been dominant, especially Japan, China and North Korea. Asia has been more successful in women's football than in men's football.

The [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] was hosted jointly by Japan and South Korea. It was the first edition not held in Europe or the Americas. The [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] is scheduled to take place in Qatar, but it was announced that it could be cancelled for bribery during the bidding process.

[[Israel]] has been banned from the Asian Games since 1978, with the AGF citing security reasons. However, Israeli sports officials contend that it was due to Arab and Chinese opposition to their participation. Samuel Lalkin, general security of the Israel Sports Federation, said "The excuse that we pose big security problems is completely ridiculous if you think that North Korea is competing. That's a worse problem, but they want to see us out. We can't take part because of what we are."&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lR8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dl0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2486,2066961&amp;dq=israel+asian+games&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], Israel sports federations have joined the European confederations.

'''Staryya Darohi''' {{lang-be|Старыя Дарогi|Staryja Darohi}}, {{lang-ru|Старые Дороги}}, {{lang-lt|Staryje Dorogos}}, {{lang-pl|Stare Drogi}}) is a town in [[Belarus|Republic of Belarus]], the capital of the [[Staryya Darohi Raion]] in the [[Minsk Voblast]]. First documental record: 1524.

==History==
In 1939, there were more than 1000 Jews living there, making up 28% of the total population. There were 2 synagogues and several Jewish schools.

During World War II, in 1941, Jews were imprisoned in a closed [[ghetto]] by Germans, some Jews managed to escape before on their own or by train. There was a fenced and guarded ghetto on Kirov street where there was a Jewish school and several houses. A group of Jews was forced to swim into the river and shot by the Germans when they were in the water, but little is known about this massacre. On January 19, 1942, the Jews were murdered in a mass execution at a place known as Kacharka. They were massacred by an SS detachment, assisted by local police. Other categories of victims like prisoners of war were also shot at this location.&lt;ref name="yahadmap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yahadmap.org/#village/staryye-dorogi-minsk-belarus.916|publisher=yahadmap.org|title=YAHAD - IN UNUM|accessdate=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after World War II, a [[displaced persons camp]] called the ''Red House'' was located outside the village. [[Primo Levi]] describes in his book ''[[The Truce]]'' during a short period when around  1,400 [[displaced person]]s from across Europe lived there with the Red Army.&lt;ref name="Patruno1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Patruno|first=Nicholas|title=Primo Levi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8TaKCoV1VecC&amp;pg=PA47|year=1995|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-026-0|pages=47–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turquerie''' ([[Anglicized]] as "Turkery") was the [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] fashion in [[Western Europe]] from the 16th to 18th centuries for imitating aspects of [[Turkish culture|Turkish]] art and culture.  Many different Western European countries were fascinated by the exotic and relatively unknown culture of [[Turkey]], which was the center of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and at the beginning of the period the only power to pose a serious military threat to Europe.  The West had a growing interest in Turkish-made products and art, including music, visual arts, architecture, and sculptures.  This fashionable phenomenon became more popular through trading routes and increased diplomatic relationships between the Ottomans and the European nations, exemplified by the [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]] in 1715. Ambassadors and traders often returned home with tales of exotic places and souvenirs of their adventures.&lt;ref name="MMA_236"&gt;{{harvp|Metropolitan Museum of Art|1968|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement was often reflected in the art of the period. Music, paintings, architecture, and artifacts were frequently inspired by the Turkish and Ottoman styles and methods. Paintings in particular portrayed the Ottomans with bright colours and sharp contrasts, suggesting their interesting peculiarity and exotic nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stein|1996|p=430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the movement==
{{further|Orientalism in early modern France}}
In the wake of the [[Age of Exploration]], roughly between the 15th and 18th centuries, there was an explosion in the number of commodities and availability of products. People were using newly created cartography and using these maps to explore the world on paper. There was an accumulation of more objects and a desire for more acquisitions. Coupling this, there was the value of [[exoticism]], valuing things that came from a great distance. Europeans and Ottomans alike were developing a consciousness of themselves in relation to the broader world.&lt;ref name="Meyer_475"&gt;{{harvp|Meyer|1974|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the Ottomans were slowly ceasing to be regarded as a serious military threat to Western Europe, despite their continuing occupation of the [[Balkans]], and campaigns such as that ended by the [[Battle of Vienna]] as late as 1683.

New patterns of consumption were arising, especially with trading ships being able to navigate around Africa. Commodities that were once expensive were becoming more affordable. Products often define people in terms of gender, age, and availability of access. This notion of social definition outlines the main theme of the explosion of commodities from 16th century and onwards. The exchange system had to do precisely with accessibility and availability of commodities on a grand scale.&lt;ref name="Breskin_97"&gt;{{harvp|Breskin|1996|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that this was not just a European phenomenon. The Europeans were not the only people who developed a sensibility of how consuming different things could define their relationships domestically and abroad. In this context, there was a broader view of consumption and one’s place within the world. A person would consume in order to show off their financial position and their social location.&lt;ref name="Breskin_97"/&gt; Coffee is an example of a commodity that became more popular as Europeans "discovered" it in Ottoman lands and experienced it.

=== European perspective ===

Europeans developed an appetite for exoticism as greater emphasis was put on empire building and colonization in other nations. There was a growing fashion for Turkish styles in Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries. Europeans did not regard Ottomans as rivals that they had to contend with and imitate militarily, politically, or diplomatically, but rather as an exotic foreign people possessing quaint and strange fashions that could be consumed. Consuming these exotic fashions would show one’s elite place in society as well as display their open-mindedness and interest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Breskin|1996|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "obsessions" with Turkish aesthetics were in part brought on by the presence of Europeans in the Ottoman Court and the acts of bringing back their products to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Avcıoğlu|first1=Nebahat|title=Turquerie and the Politics of Representation, 1728-1876|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|isbn=9780754664222|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased mercantile relationships between the Turkish people and the Europeans aided this process; the continuation of these trading systems helped to spread new fashions quickly in Europe.&lt;ref name="MMA_236"/&gt;

== Decorations and patterns ==
[[File:Hofmobiliendepot - Türkisches Zimmer von Kronprinz Rudolf.JPG|thumb|[[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria]] had his working room decorated in the Turkish style in 1881. It is partially preserved at the ''[[Hofmobiliendepot]]'' in Vienna.]]

Brightly colored Turkish styles of decoration were used on many types of objects, including timepieces. Many of those imported had the hours and religious names in Arabic characters. A person who owned one of these timepieces was one with an increased social status.&lt;ref name="MMA_236"/&gt;

The Turkish grandeur portrayed by the sultans was attractive to Europeans. [[Agostino Veneziano]] made a portrait of [[Suleyman the Magnificent]], sultan of the Ottoman Empire in 1520. He was known as the “grand Turk” and constantly disrupted European balance. The image portrays the sultan as a gentle, yet barbaric person. He was most known for executing the wishes of the sultana, [[Roxelana]], who wanted their children murdered to secure the throne for one of their sons.&lt;ref name="MMA_229"/&gt;

Fabrics were often bright, rich, and embroidered, as depicted in the painting, ''Himan de la Grande Mosquee'' by [[Joseph-Marie Vien]] in 1748. In the context of turquerie, Turkish textiles were also a luxury in the elitist European homes. They often 
had velvet grounds with stylized floral motifs. They were often woven in Asia Minor for the European market or, more commonly, as Venetian, under Turkish influence. Italian-styled textiles were often woven by the Ottoman Turks for the Venetians because of their cheap labour and continued business relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Metropolitan Museum of Art|1968|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Portraits: European and American ==

Social position was something very important in the 18th century so things like dress, posture, and props were carefully selected in order to communicate one's status. This need to express status mixed with a new interest for Turkish style allowed for Turkish dress and decorations to become very important props.This included wearing loose, flowing gowns belted with ornate bands of embroidered cloth and ermine-trimmed robes with tasseled turbans. Women even abandoned their corsets and attached strings of pearls to their hair for much more freeing material.&lt;ref name="Breskin_993"&gt;{{harvp|Breskin|2001|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loose clothing and the unorthodox styles added to the lewd perceptions of the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Breskin_993" /&gt; This interest was something that motivated  the creation of many portraits were Turkish people were often depicted as exotic, and it became rare to see portraits where they were painted without wearing their traditional cultural clothing. Writing also contributed to the visual aspect of Turkish cultural exchange and perhaps the most influential transformation into the turquerie vogue in Europe was done by [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]]. Montagu went to Turkey in 1717 when her husband was posted as ambassador there. Her collected letters describing Turkish fashion were widely distributed in manuscript form in her social circle and were then printed for the public upon her death in 1762.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Breskin|2001|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her letters and descriptions helped shape how Europeans interpreted the Turkish fashion and how to dress. This phenomenon eventually found its way across the Atlantic and in colonial America, where Montagu’s letters were also published.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Breskin|2001|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opera ==
[[File:Jean-Étienne Liotard 007.jpg|thumb|upright|Two 18th century Turkish women, pastel by [[Jean-Étienne Liotard]], who visited Turkey with a British ambassador in 1738. Unlike their baggy trousers, the huge [[patten (shoe)|pattens]] worn by the women would not have struck Europeans as remarkable, as Western women wore similar overshoes.]]
In 18th century Europe, it was in fashion to smoke Turkish tobacco in a Turkish pipe, wearing a Turkish robe, all while in an elaborate Turkish costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Meyer|1974|p=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; European opera was influenced heavily by the idea of turquerie. [[Mehmed II]] (1451–1481), the conqueror and one of the most prominent sultans of the Ottoman Empire, had many operas written about him. His defeat of [[Constantinople]] in 1453 was the basis of the German opera Mehmed II, composed by [[Reinhard Keiser]] in 1693.&lt;ref name="Meyer_475"/&gt; As well, there were many operas based on the ongoing conflicts between [[Timur]] and [[Beyazid I]], including [[Tamerlano]] by [[George Handel]].  These stories of perseverance and passion appealed to many Europeans and therefore gained popularity. One of [[France]]’s most important opera genres was ''[[tragedie lyrique]]'', depicted by ''[[Scanderberg]]'', with music by [[François Rebel]] and [[Francois Francoeur]] and the libretto by [[Antoine Houdar de la Motte]] in 1735.&lt;ref name="Meyer_476"&gt;{{harvp|Meyer|1974|p=476}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opera was visually one of the most elaborate of the Turkish operas, with detailed scenic designs for mosques and seraglio courts. As well, many exotic characters were displayed.

Operas using themes from turquerie were in the usual European languages but tried to imitate the Turkish culture and customs. It offered a world of fantasy, splendor, and adventure that was unattainable by the average person.&lt;ref name="Meyer_476"/&gt; Audiences would be fascinated with the Turkish and Ottoman institutions depicted. The stories and implications as well as the extravagant costumes and elaborate staging appealed to the people. The Europeans craved reality in their depiction of the Turkish peoples. During performances, females would often be in the latest fashion, where local colour was suggested by foreign attire or numerous ornaments. The males tended to wear more authentic Turkish dress than the female, including a turban, sash, long caftan, and binding with rich material, since authentic Turkish female dress was often restrictive and plain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Meyer|1974|p=478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==
[[File:Unknown French artist, Portrait of an unknown man wearing Turkish costume.jpg|thumb|upright|Turquerie by [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]].]]
{{main|Turkish music (style)}}
The music in operas that utilized the notion of turquerie was not seriously influenced by Turkish music. Composers in the 18th century were not interested in [[ethnomusicology]], to adopt the style of sound of a particular country or area.&lt;ref name="Meyer_483"&gt;{{harvp|Meyer|1974|p=483}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European audiences were not yet ready to accept the unappealing and what they thought of as primitive musical style of the Turkish people. Traditional Turkish music included wavering pitches, microtones, arabesques, different scale systems, and non-Western rhythmic patterns. Europeans thought of this type of music, as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] once said, "offensive to the ears."&lt;ref name="Meyer_483"/&gt; Having short spurts of it in the operas were common, but just to add comedic affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Meyer|1974|p=484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital and largest city is [[Harare]].  A country of roughly {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population |Zimbabwe}}|R}}/1e6 round 0}} million{{UN_Population |ref}} people, Zimbabwe has 16 [[official languages]],&lt;ref name="language" /&gt; with [[English language|English]], [[Shona language|Shona]], and [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]] the most commonly used.

Since the 11th century, present-day Zimbabwe has been the site of several organised states and kingdoms as well as a major route for migration and trade.  The [[British South Africa Company]] of [[Cecil Rhodes]] first [[Rhodesia (region)|demarcated]] the present territory during the 1890s; it became the [[self-governing colony|self-governing]] British colony of [[Southern Rhodesia]] in 1923.  In 1965, the conservative [[White people in Zimbabwe|white]] [[Minority rule|minority government]] [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] as [[Rhodesia]].  The state endured international isolation and a 15-year [[Rhodesian Bush War|guerrilla war]] with [[black nationalist]] forces; this culminated in a [[Lancaster House Agreement|peace agreement]] that established universal enfranchisement and ''[[de jure]]'' sovereignty as Zimbabwe in April 1980. Zimbabwe then joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], from which it was suspended in 2002 for breaches of international law by its then-government, and from which it withdrew in December 2003. The [[sovereign state]] is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[African Union]] (AU), and the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA). It was once known as the "Jewel of Africa" for its prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/15/robert-mugabe-tarnished-jewel-zimbabwe-now-chance-shine/|title=Robert Mugabe tarnished the jewel that is Zimbabwe.

==Etymology ==
&lt;!-- Section header is linked. --&gt;
{{further|Great Zimbabwe|Rhodesia (name)}}
The name "Zimbabwe" stems from a [[Shona language|Shona]] term for [[Great Zimbabwe]], an ancient ruined city in the country's south-east whose remains are now a protected site. Two different theories address the origin of the word. Many sources hold that "Zimbabwe" derives from ''dzimba-dza-mabwe'', translated from the Karanga dialect of Shona as "houses of stones" (''dzimba'' = plural of ''imba'', "house"; ''mabwe'' = plural of ''bwe'', "stone").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.somalipress.com/zimbabwe-overview/zimbabwe-big-house-stone-1145.html|title= Zimbabwe – big house of stone|publisher= Somali Press|accessdate= 14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Shona Class 5 revisited: a case against *ri as Class 5 nominal prefix|journal= Zambezia|year= 1994|volume= 21|pages= 51–80|author= Lafon, Michel|url= http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Journal%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Zimbabwe/vol21n1/juz021001005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Mediated monuments and national identity|author= Vale, Lawrence J.|doi= 10.1080/136023699373774|journal= Journal of Architecture|volume= 4|year= 1999|pages= 391–408|issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Karanga-speaking Shona people live around Great Zimbabwe in the modern-day [[Provinces of Zimbabwe|province]] of [[Masvingo Province|Masvingo]]. Archaeologist [[Peter Garlake]] claims that "Zimbabwe" represents a contracted form of ''dzimba-hwe'', which means "venerated houses" in the Zezuru dialect of Shona and usually references chiefs' houses or graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Garlake|first= Peter|authorlink= Peter Garlake|title= Great Zimbabwe: New Aspects of Archaeology|year= 1973|publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson|location= London, UK|isbn= 978-0-8128-1599-3|page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimbabwe was formerly known as [[Southern Rhodesia]] (1898), [[Rhodesia]] (1965), and [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] (1979). The first recorded use of "Zimbabwe" as a term of national reference dates from 1960 as a coinage by the black nationalist Michael Mawema,&lt;ref name=fontein119120/&gt; whose Zimbabwe National Party became the first to officially use the name in 1961.&lt;ref name=ndlovugatsheni113114/&gt;  The term "Rhodesia"—derived from the surname of [[Cecil Rhodes]], the primary instigator of British colonisation of the territory during the late 19th century—was perceived by African nationalists as inappropriate because of its colonial origin and connotations.&lt;ref name=fontein119120&gt;{{cite book|title= The Silence of Great Zimbabwe: Contested Landscapes and the Power of Heritage|last= Fontein|first= Joost|location= London|publisher= [[University College London| University College London Press]]|date= September 2006|edition= First|isbn= 978-1844721238|pages= 119–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mawema, black nationalists held a meeting in 1960 to choose an alternative name for the country, proposing names such as "Matshobana" and "[[Monomotapa]]" before his suggestion, "Zimbabwe", prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= What's in a Name? Welcome to the 'Republic of Machobana'|journal= Read on|publisher= Training Aids Development Group|location= Harare|year= 1991|page= 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further alternative, put forward by nationalists in [[Matabeleland]], had been "Matopos", referring to the [[Matobo National Park|Matopos Hills]] to the south of [[Bulawayo]].&lt;ref name=ndlovugatsheni113114&gt;{{cite book|title= Do "Zimbabweans" Exist?

It was initially unclear how the chosen term was to be used — a letter written by Mawema in 1961 refers to "Zimbabweland"&lt;ref name=ndlovugatsheni113114/&gt; — but "Zimbabwe" was sufficiently established by 1962 to become the generally preferred term of the black nationalist movement.&lt;ref name=fontein119120/&gt; In a 2001 interview, black nationalist [[Edson Zvobgo]] recalled that Mawema mentioned the name during a political rally, "and it caught hold, and that was that".&lt;ref name=fontein119120/&gt; The black nationalist factions subsequently used the name during the Second ''[[Chimurenga]]'' campaigns against the Rhodesian government during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]] of 1964–1979. Major factions in this camp included the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (led by [[Robert Mugabe]] from 1975), and the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (led by [[Joshua Nkomo]] from its founding in the early 1960s).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==History==
{{Main|History of Zimbabwe}}

=== Before 1887 ===
{{further|Bantu expansion}}
[[File:Tower, Great Zimbabwe1.jpg|thumb|upright|Towers of [[Great Zimbabwe]].]]
Societies speaking proto-Shona languages first emerged in the middle Limpopo valley in the 9th century before moving on to the Zimbabwean highlands. The Zimbabwean plateau eventually became the centre of subsequent Shona states, beginning around the 10th century. Around the early 10th century, trade developed with [[Shirazi era| Arab merchants]] on the Indian Ocean coast, helping to develop the [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]] in the 11th century. This was the precursor to the more impressive Shona civilisations that would dominate the region during the 13th to 15th centuries, evidenced by ruins at [[Great Zimbabwe]], near [[Masvingo]], and by other smaller sites. The main archaeological site uses a unique dry stone architecture.

The Kingdom of Mapungubwe was the first in a series of sophisticated trading states which had developed in Zimbabwe by the time the first European explorers arrived from Portugal. These states traded gold, ivory, and copper for cloth and glass.&lt;ref name="autogenerated241"&gt;{{cite book|title= Historical Archaeology |last= Hall|first= Martin|author2= Stephen W. Silliman|year= 2005|publisher= Wiley Blackwell|isbn= 978-1-4051-0751-8|pages=241–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1300 until 1600 the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]] eclipsed Mapungubwe. This Shona state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe's stone architecture, which survives to this day at the ruins of the kingdom's capital of Great Zimbabwe. From {{circa}} 1450 to 1760 Zimbabwe gave way to the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. This Shona state ruled much of the area of present-day Zimbabwe, plus parts of central [[Mozambique]]. It is known by many names including the [[Mutapa Empire]], also known as ''Mwene Mutapa'' or ''Monomotapa'' as well as "Munhumutapa", and was renowned for its strategic trade routes with the [[Arabs]] and Portugal. The Portuguese sought to monopolise this influence and began a series of wars which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th century.&lt;ref name="autogenerated241"/&gt;

As a direct response to increased [[Europe]]an presence in the interior, and especially due to the increasing amount of Carnegie family farmers,{{cn|date=November 2018}} a new Shona state emerged, known as the [[Rozwi Empire]] (1684–1834). Relying on centuries of military, political and religious development, the Rozwi (meaning "destroyers") expelled the Portuguese from the Zimbabwean plateau{{when?|date=November 2018}} by force of arms. They continued the stone-building traditions of the Zimbabwe and Mapungubwe kingdoms while adding [[musket]]s to their arsenal and recruiting a professional army to defend recent conquests.{{citation needed|date= May 2016}}

Around 1821 the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] general [[Mzilikazi]] of the [[Khumalo clan]] successfully rebelled against King [[Shaka]] and established his own clan, the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe) |Ndebele]]. The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the [[South African Republic| Transvaal]], leaving a trail of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the [[Mfecane]]. When [[Dutch people |Dutch]] [[Boers| trekboers]] converged on the Transvaal in 1836, they drove the tribe even further northward, with the assistance of [[Tswana people | Tswana]] [[Barolong]] warriors and [[Griqua people | Griqua]] [[commando]]s. By 1838 the Ndebele had conquered the Rozwi Empire, along with the other smaller Shona states, and reduced them to [[vassal]]dom.&lt;ref name="zimstudy"&gt;{{cite book|last= Nelson|first= Harold|title= Zimbabwe: A Country Study |pages= 1–317|publisher= The Studies | year= 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After losing their remaining South African lands in 1840, Mzilikazi and his tribe permanently settled in the southwest of present-day Zimbabwe in what became known as [[Matabeleland]], establishing [[Bulawayo]] as their capital. Mzilikazi then organised his society into a military system with regimental [[kraal]]s, similar to those of Shaka, which was stable enough to repel further Boer incursions. Mzilikazi died in 1868; following a violent power struggle, his son [[Lobengula]] succeeded him.

[[File:Matabeleland.png|thumb|right|[[Matabeleland]] in the 19th century.]]
In the 1880s, European colonists arrived with [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC). In 1888, Rhodes obtained a [[Rudd Concession|concession for mining rights]] from [[King Lobengula]] of the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] peoples.&lt;ref name="mining"&gt;Hensman, Howard (1901). ''Cecil Rhodes: A Study of a Career''. pp. 106–07.&lt;!-- publishing info; ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He presented this concession to persuade the government of the United Kingdom to grant a [[royal charter]] to the company over [[Matabeleland]], and its subject states such as [[Mashonaland]] as well.&lt;ref name="treaties"&gt;[[#Parsons|Parsons]], pp. 178–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the [[Pioneer Column]], a group of Europeans protected by well-armed [[British South Africa Police]] (BSAP) through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (now [[Harare]]), and thereby establish [[Company rule in Rhodesia|company rule]] over the area. In 1893 and 1894, with the help of their new [[Maxim gun|Maxim]] guns, the BSAP would go on to defeat the Ndebele in the [[First Matabele War]]. Rhodes additionally sought permission to negotiate similar concessions covering all territory between the [[Limpopo River]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]], then known as "Zambesia".&lt;ref name="treaties"/&gt;

In accordance with the terms of aforementioned concessions and treaties,&lt;ref name="treaties"/&gt; mass settlement was encouraged, with the British maintaining control over labour as well as precious metals and other mineral resources.&lt;ref name="bsac"&gt;Bryce, James (2008). ''Impressions of South Africa''. p. 170; {{ISBN|055430032X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, the BSAC adopted the name "[[Rhodesia (name)|Rhodesia]]" for the territory, in honour of Rhodes. In 1898 "[[Southern Rhodesia]]" became the official name for the region south of the Zambezi,&lt;ref&gt;Southern Rhodesia Order in Council of 20 October 1898 which includes at seection 4 thereof: "The territory for the time being within the limits of this Order shall be known as Southern Rhodesia."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adopted"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/V3N1/V3N1.htm|title=A Country in Search of a Name|author=Gray, J.

The region to the north was administered separately and later termed [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]). Shortly after Rhodes' disastrous [[Jameson Raid]] on the [[South African Republic]], the Ndebele rebelled against white rule, led by their  charismatic religious leader, Mlimo. The [[Second Matabele War]] lasted in Matabeleland until 1896, when Mlimo was assassinated. Shona agitators staged unsuccessful revolts (known as ''[[Chimurenga]]'') against company rule during 1896 and 1897.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Following these failed insurrections, the Ndebele and Shona groups were finally subdued by the Rhodes administration, which organised the land with a disproportionate bias favouring Europeans, thus displacing many indigenous peoples.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Southern Rhodesia was annexed by the [[United Kingdom]] on 12 September 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Southern Rhodesia (Annexation) Order in Council, 30 July 1923 which provided by section 3 thereof: "From and after the coming into operation of this Order the said territories shall be annexed to and form part of His Majesty's Dominions, and shall be known as the Colony of Southern Rhodesia."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stella Madzibamuto v Desmond William  Larder – Burke, Fredrick Phillip George (1969) A.C 645 – Authority for date of annexation having been 12 September 1923, being the date the Rhodesia (Annexation) Order in Council came into effect&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Collective Responses to Illegal Acts in International Law: United Nations Action in the Question of Southern Rhodesia'' by Vera Gowlland-Debbas&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stella Madzibamuto v Desmond William  Larder – Burke, Fredrick Phillip George (1969) A.C 645&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after annexation, on 1 October 1923, the first constitution for the new Colony of Southern Rhodesia came into force.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern Rhodesia Constitution Letters Patent, 1923&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the new constitution, Southern Rhodesia became a [[self-governing colony|self-governing]] [[British Empire|British colony]], subsequent to a 1922 referendum. Rhodesians of all races served on behalf of the United Kingdom during the two World Wars. Proportional to the white population, Southern Rhodesia contributed more per capita to both the [[Southern Rhodesia in World War I|First]] and [[Southern Rhodesia in World War II|Second World Wars]] than any other part of the Empire, including Britain itself.&lt;ref name="moorcraft"/&gt;

In 1953, in the face of African opposition,&lt;ref name="fed"&gt;[[#Parsons|Parsons]], p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain consolidated the two Rhodesias with [[Nyasaland]] ([[Malawi]]) in the ill-fated [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland|Central African Federation]], which was essentially dominated by Southern Rhodesia. Growing [[African nationalism]] and general dissent, particularly in Nyasaland, persuaded Britain to dissolve the Union in 1963, forming three separate divisions. While multiracial democracy was finally introduced to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, however, Southern Rhodesians of European ancestry continued to enjoy [[minority rule]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

With Zambian independence, [[Ian Smith]]'s [[Rhodesian Front]] (RF) dropped the designation "Southern" in 1964 and issued a [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] (commonly abbreviated to "UDI") from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965, intent on effectively repudiating the recently adopted British policy of "[[no independence before majority rule]]". It was the first such course taken by a British colony since the [[United States Declaration of Independence|American declaration]] of 1776, which Smith and others indeed claimed provided a suitable precedent to their own actions.&lt;ref name="moorcraft"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.historytoday.com/paul-moorcraft/rhodesias-war-independence|title=Rhodesia's War of Independence|date=31 August 1990|journal=History Today|volume=40 |issue= 9|first=Paul|last=Moorcraft|quote=[P]er head of (white) population Rhodesia had contributed more in both world wars than any other part of the empire, including the United Kingdom. ...

[[File:Udi2-rho.jpg|thumb|[[Ian Smith]] signing the [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] on 11 November 1965 with his cabinet in audience.]]
After the [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] (UDI), the British government petitioned the United Nations for [[economic sanctions|sanctions]] against Rhodesia pending unsuccessful talks with Smith's administration in 1966 and 1968. In December 1966, the organisation complied, imposing the first mandatory trade embargo on an autonomous state.&lt;ref name="eafp"&gt;Hastedt, Glenn P. (2004) ''Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy'', Infobase Publishing, p. 537; {{ISBN|143810989X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These sanctions were expanded again in 1968.&lt;ref name="eafp"/&gt;

The United Kingdom deemed the Rhodesian declaration an act of rebellion, but did not re-establish control by force. A [[Rhodesian Bush War|guerrilla war]] subsequently ensued when [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) and [[Robert Mugabe]]'s [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), supported actively by communist powers and neighbouring African nations, initiated guerilla operations against Rhodesia's predominantly white government. ZAPU was supported by the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Warsaw Pact]] and associated nations such as Cuba, and adopted a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideology; ZANU meanwhile aligned itself with [[Maoism]] and the bloc headed by the People's Republic of China. Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970, following the results of a [[Rhodesian constitutional referendum, 1969|referendum]] the previous year, but this went unrecognised internationally. Meanwhile, Rhodesia's internal conflict intensified, eventually forcing him to open negotiations with the militant communists.

In March 1978, Smith reached an accord with three African leaders, led by Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]], who offered to leave the white population comfortably entrenched in exchange for the establishment of a biracial democracy. As a result of the [[Internal Settlement]], [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election, 1979|elections]] were held in April 1979, concluding with the [[United African National Council]] (UANC) carrying a majority of parliamentary seats. On 1 June 1979, Muzorewa, the UANC head, became prime minister and the country's name was changed to [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]]. The [[Internal Settlement]] left control of the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]], civil service, judiciary, and a third of parliament seats to whites.&lt;ref name="endsanctions"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/1/newsid_2492000/2492915.stm|title=On This Day|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=14 December 2008 | date=1 June 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 June, the [[United States Senate]] voted to lift economic pressure on the former Rhodesia.

Following the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1979|fifth Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM), held in [[Lusaka]], Zambia from 1 to 7 August in 1979, the British government invited Muzorewa, Mugabe, and Nkomo to participate in a constitutional conference at [[Lancaster House]]. The purpose of the conference was to discuss and reach an agreement on the terms of an independence constitution, and provide for elections supervised under British authority allowing Zimbabwe Rhodesia to proceed to legal independence.&lt;ref name="chair"&gt;Chung, Fay (2006).

With [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]], [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] of the United Kingdom, in the chair, these discussions were mounted from 10 September to 15 December in 1979, producing a total of 47 [[plenary session]]s.&lt;ref name="chair" /&gt; On 21 December 1979, delegations from every major interest represented reached the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], effectively ending the guerrilla war.&lt;ref name="lancaster"&gt;Preston, Matthew (2004).

On 11 December 1979, the Rhodesian House of Assembly voted 90 to nil to revert to British colonial status (the 'aye' votes included Ian Smith himself). The bill then passed the Senate and was assented to by the President. With the arrival of [[Christopher Soames, Baron Soames|Lord Soames]], the new Governor, just after 2 p.m. on 12 December 1979, Britain formally took control of [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] as the Colony of [[Southern Rhodesia]], although on 13 December Soames declared that during his mandate the name Rhodesia and Zimbabwe Rhodesia would continue to be used. Britain lifted sanctions on 12 December, and the [[United Nations]] on 16 December, before calling on its member states to do likewise on 21 December. Thus Zambia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Angola and Botswana lifted sanctions on 22–23 December; Australia partly pre-empted this,  lifting all but trade sanctions on 18 December, and trade sanctions on 21 December.&lt;ref&gt;Zimbabwe, May 1980/Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, Canberra: Government Printer, 1980. p. 122.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Land redistribution re-emerged as the main issue for the [[ZANU (PF)|ZANU-PF]] government around 1997. Despite the existence of a "willing-buyer-willing-seller" land reform programme since the 1980s, the minority white Zimbabwean population of around 0.6% continued to hold 70% of the country's most fertile agricultural land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/692638.stm |title=Britain's troubles with Mugabe|publisher=BBC News|date=3 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, [[2017 Zimbabwean coup d'état|the army led a coup d'état]] following the dismissal of Vice President [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]], placing Mugabe under house arrest. The army denied that their actions constituted a [[coup]].&lt;ref name="cnn_turmoil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian_confined" /&gt; Mugabe resigned on 21 November 2017, after leading the country for 37 years. Although under the [[Constitution of Zimbabwe]] Mugabe should be succeeded by Vice President [[Phelekezela Mphoko]], a supporter of [[Grace Mugabe]], ZANU-PF chief whip [[Lovemore Matuke]] stated to the [[Reuters]] news agency that Mnangagwa would be appointed as president.&lt;ref name="bbc_resigns" /&gt;

In December 2017 the website Zimbabwe News, calculating the cost of the Mugabe era using various statistics, said that at the time of independence in 1980, the country was growing economically at about 5 per cent a year, and had done so for quite a long time. If this rate of growth had been maintained for the next 37 years, Zimbabwe  would have in 2016 a GDP of US$52 billion. Instead it had a formal sector GDP of only US$14 billion, a cost of US$38 billion in lost growth. The population growth in 1980 was among the highest in Africa at about 3,5 per cent per annum, doubling every 21 years. Had this growth been maintained, the population would have been 31 million. Instead, as of 2018, it is about 13 million. The discrepancies were believed to be partly caused by death from starvation and disease, and partly due to decreased fertility. The life expectancy has halved, and death from politically motivated violence sponsored by government exceeds 200,000 since 1980. The Mugabe government has directly or indirectly caused the deaths of at least 3 million Zimbabweans in 37 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newzimbabwe.com/columns-40850-The+costs+of+the+Robert+Mugabe+era/columns.aspx|title=The costs of the Robert Mugabe era|website=newzimbabwe.com|accessdate=12 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201005250/http://www.newzimbabwe.com/columns-40850-The+costs+of+the+Robert+Mugabe+era/columns.aspx#|archive-date=1 February 2018|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and environment==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
{{main|Geography of Zimbabwe}}
[[File:ZmbziRvr.jpg|thumb|The [[Zambezi River]] in the [[Mana Pools National Park]].]]
[[File:Zimbabwe map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Zimbabwe map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa, lying between latitudes [[15th parallel south|15°]] and [[23rd parallel south|23°S]], and longitudes [[25th meridian east|25°]] and [[34th meridian east|34°E]]. It is bordered by [[South Africa]] to the south, [[Botswana]] to the west and southwest, [[Zambia]] to the northwest, and [[Mozambique]] to the east and northeast. Its northwest corner is roughly 150 meters from [[Namibia]], nearly forming a four-nation [[quadripoint]]. Most of the country is elevated, consisting of a central plateau (high veld) stretching from the southwest northwards with altitudes between 1,000 and 1,600 m. The country's extreme east is mountainous, this area being known as the Eastern Highlands, with [[Mount Nyangani]] as the highest point at 2,592 m.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

These highlands are renowned for their great natural beauty, with famous tourist destinations such as Nyanga, Troutbeck, Chimanimani, Vumba and Chirinda Forest at Mount Selinda. About 20% of the country consists of low-lying areas, (the low veld) under 900m. [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]], one of the world's biggest and most spectacular waterfalls, is located in the country's extreme northwest and is part of the [[Zambezi]] river.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

=== Geology ===
Over geological time Zimbabwe has experienced two major post-Gondwana erosion cycles (Known as African and post-African), and a very subordinate Plio-Pleistocene cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=A E |display-authors=etal|date=2009|title=Landscape evolution in Zimbabwe from the Permian to present, with implications for kimberlite prospecting|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/Moore2009_2.pdf|journal=Geological Society of South Africa|volume=112|pages=1–47–88|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Zimbabwe has a tropical climate with many local variations. The southern areas are known for their heat and aridity, parts of the central plateau receive frost in winter, the Zambezi valley is also known for its extreme heat and the Eastern Highlands usually experience cool temperatures and the highest rainfall in the country. The country's rainy season generally runs from late October to March and the hot climate is moderated by increasing altitude. Zimbabwe is faced with recurring droughts, the latest one commencing early in 2015 and ongoing into 2016. Severe storms are rare.&lt;ref name="Baughan, M. 2005"&gt;Baughan, M. (2005).

===Flora and fauna===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
{{main|Wildlife of Zimbabwe}}
[[File:Curled trunk.jpg|thumb|An elephant at a water hole in [[Hwange National Park]].]]
The country is mostly savannah, although the moist and mountainous eastern highlands support areas of tropical evergreen and hardwood forests. Trees found in these Eastern Highlands include [[teak]], [[mahogany]], enormous specimens of strangling fig, forest newtonia, big leaf, white stinkwood, chirinda stinkwood, knobthorn and many others.

In the low-lying parts of the country fever trees, mopane, combretum and baobabs abound. Much of the country is covered by miombo woodland, dominated by brachystegia species and others. Among the numerous flowers and shrubs are hibiscus, flame lily, snake lily, spider lily, leonotus, cassia, tree wisteria and dombeya. There are around 350 species of mammals that can be found in Zimbabwe. There are also many snakes and lizards, over 500 bird species, and 131 fish species.

===Environmental issues===
Large parts of Zimbabwe were once covered by forests with abundant wildlife. [[Deforestation]] and [[poaching]] has reduced the amount of wildlife. Wood[[land degradation]] and deforestation, due to [[population growth]], [[urban expansion]] and lack of fuel, are major concerns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(99)00156-5|title=Deforestation of woodlands in communal areas of Zimbabwe: is it due to agricultural policies?|year=2000|last1=Chipika|first1=J|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=79|page=175|last2=Kowero|first2=G.|issue=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have led to erosion and land degradation which diminish the amount of fertile soil. Local farmers have also been criticised by environmentalists for burning off vegetation to heat their tobacco barns.&lt;ref name="Forestry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdzezimbabwe.co.uk/2015/03/chaos-as-tobacco-sales-start.html|title=Chaos as tobacco sales start|publisher=NewsdezeZimbabwe|accessdate=21 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927163223/http://www.undp.org.zw/component/docman/doc_download/230-zimbabwe-poverty-report-2011-april-17-2013 |archivedate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Zimbabwe|Elections in Zimbabwe}}
Zimbabwe is a republic with a [[presidential system]] of government. The [[semi-presidential system]] was abolished with the adoption of a new constitution after a [[Zimbabwean constitutional referendum, 2013|referendum]] in March 2013. Under the constitutional changes in 2005, an [[upper chamber]], the [[Senate of Zimbabwe|Senate]], was reinstated.&lt;ref name="reinstated"&gt;[http://www.kubatana.net/html/archive/legisl/050916czamd17ac.asp?sector=LEGISL Constitution of Zimbabwe Amendment (No. 17) Act, 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233356/http://www.kubatana.net/html/archive/legisl/050916czamd17ac.asp?sector=LEGISL |date=27 September 2007 }} NGO Network Alliance Project&lt;/ref&gt; The [[House of Assembly of Zimbabwe|House of Assembly]] is the [[lower chamber]] of Parliament. Former President [[Robert Mugabe]]'s [[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front]] (commonly abbreviated ZANU-PF) has been the dominant political party in Zimbabwe since independence.&lt;ref&gt;Mugabe, Robert. (2007). ''Encyclopædia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite'', Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed, page(s) needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 then-prime minister Mugabe revised the constitution, abolishing the [[Parliamentary republic|ceremonial presidency]] and the prime ministerial posts to form an executive president, a [[Presidential system]]. His ZANU party has won every election since independence, in the 1990 election the second-placed party, [[Edgar Tekere]]'s Zimbabwe Unity Movement, won only 20% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/review27.15680.html|title=Tekere says Mugabe 'insecure' in new book|accessdate=6 January 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227185709/http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/review27.15680.html|archivedate=27 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1995 parliamentary elections most opposition parties, including the ZUM, boycotted the voting, resulting in a near-sweep by the ruling party.&lt;ref name="Frankel"&gt;Frankel, Matthew. [http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2010/0526_myanmar_boycott_frankel.aspx "Myanmar Boycott is Misguided"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511085706/http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2010/0526_myanmar_boycott_frankel.aspx |date=11 May 2011 }}, [http://www.brookings.edu The Brookings Institution], 26 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; When the opposition returned to the polls in 2000, they won 57 seats, only five fewer than ZANU.&lt;ref name="Frankel"/&gt;

Presidential elections were again held in 2002 amid allegations of vote-rigging, intimidation and fraud.&lt;ref name="allegations"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140104021201/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/afrfocus/afrfocus041805.html Zimbabwe: Election Fraud Report, 04/18/05]. [[University of Pennsylvania]], 18 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2005|2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections]] were held on 31 March and multiple claims of vote rigging, election fraud and intimidation were made by the MDC and [[Jonathan Moyo]], calling for investigations into 32 of the 120 constituencies.&lt;ref name="moyo"&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=84&amp;art_id=qw111061602454B251 "Mugabe's former ally accuses him of foul play"], ''Independent Online Zimbabwe'', 12 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Moyo participated in the elections despite the allegations and won a seat as an independent member of Parliament.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

General elections were again held in Zimbabwe on 30 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7322468.stm|title=Zimbabwe stands 'on a precipice'|publisher=BBC News|date=31 March 2008|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official results required a runoff between Mugabe and [[Morgan Tsvangirai]], the opposition leader; the MDC challenged these results, claiming widespread election fraud by the Mugabe government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/03/27/zimbabwe.election|title=Mugabe critics predict fraud in Zimbabwe elections|date=28 March 2008|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The run-off was scheduled for 27 June 2008. On 22 June, citing the continuing unfairness of the process and refusing to participate in a "violent, illegitimate sham of an election process", Tsvangirai pulled out of the presidential run-off, the ZEC held the run-off and President Mugabe received a landslide majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7467990.stm|title=Mugabe rival quits election race|publisher=BBC News|date=22 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Election campaign March 2005.jpg|thumb|Supporters of the [[Movement for Democratic Change (prior to 2005)|Movement for Democratic Change]] in 2005.]]
The [[MDC-T]] led by Morgan Tsvangirai is now the majority in the Lower chamber of Parliament. The MDC split into two factions. One faction ([[MDC-M]]), now led by [[Arthur Mutambara]] contested the elections to the Senate, while the other, led by Tsvangirai, opposed to contesting the elections, stating that participation in a rigged election is tantamount to endorsing Mugabe's claim that past elections were free and fair. The opposition parties have resumed participation in national and local elections as recently as 2006. The two MDC camps had their congresses in 2006 with Tsvangirai being elected to lead [[MDC-T]], which has become more popular than the other group.&lt;ref name="findarticles1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1660337.html|work=The Independent|location=UK|title=Contrast in styles as contenders hold rallies in Harare townships|date=4 March 2002|author=Latham, Brian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229132808/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1660337.html |archivedate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutambara, a robotics professor and former [[NASA]] robotics specialist has replaced [[Welshman Ncube]] who was the interim leader of MDC-M after the split. Morgan Tsvangirai did not participate in the Senate elections, while the Mutambara faction participated and won five seats in the Senate. The Mutambara formation has been weakened by defections from MPs and individuals who are disillusioned by their manifesto. {{As of|2008}}, the Movement for Democratic Change has become the most popular, with crowds as large as 20,000 attending their rallies as compared to between 500–5,000 for the other formation.&lt;ref name="findarticles1"/&gt;

On 28 April 2008, Tsvangirai and Mutambara announced at a joint news conference in [[Johannesburg]] that the two MDC formations were co-operating, enabling the MDC to have a clear parliamentary majority.&lt;ref name="SABCre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabcnews.com/africa/southern_africa/0,2172,168544,00.html |title=Zimbabwe’s MDC factions reunite |accessdate=13 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502155226/http://www.sabcnews.com/africa/southern_africa/0%2C2172%2C168544%2C00.html |archivedate= 2 May 2008 |df= }}, SABC News, 28 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reunites"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7371823.stm|title=Opposition reunites in Zimbabwe|publisher=BBC News|date=28 April 2008|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsvangirai said that Mugabe could not remain President without a parliamentary majority.&lt;ref name="Reunites"/&gt; On the same day, Silaigwana announced that the recounts for the final five constituencies had been completed, that the results were being collated and that they would be published on 29 April.&lt;ref&gt;Chinaka, Cris (29 April 2008) [http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/all-eyes-on-zim-as-zec-wrap-up-recount-1.398301 All eyes on Zim as ZEC wrap-up recount], Reuters via iol.co.za; accessed 4 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-September 2008, after protracted negotiations overseen by the leaders of South Africa and Mozambique, Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed a power-sharing deal which would see Mugabe retain control over the army. Donor nations have adopted a 'wait-and-see' attitude, wanting to see real change being brought about by this merger before committing themselves to funding rebuilding efforts, which are estimated to take at least five years. On 11 February 2009 Tsvangirai was sworn in as Prime Minister by President Mugabe.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In November 2008, the government of Zimbabwe spent US$7.3 million donated by the [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]]. A representative of the organisation declined to speculate on how the money was spent, except that it was not for the intended purpose, and the government has failed to honour requests to return the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/world/africa/03zimbabwe.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=Aid Group Says Zimbabwe Misused $7.3 Million|work=The New York Times|date=3 November 2008|first=Celia W.|last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Zimbabwe's election chief, [[Simpson Mtambanengwe]], resigned due to ill health.

In 2011, there were reports of 640 corpses having been recovered from the Monkey William Mine in [[Chibondo]].

Government Minister Saviour Kasukuwere admitted the remains were discovered in 2008, but claimed the remains were decades old despite clear evidence the exhumed skeletons still had hair and clothes.

{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
{{Main|Zimbabwe Defence Forces}}
[[File:Flag of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces.svg|thumb|The flag of the [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]].]]
The Zimbabwe Defence Forces were set up by unifying three insurrectionist forces – the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA), the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA), and the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] (RSF) – after the [[Second Chimurenga]] and Zimbabwean independence in 1980. The integration period saw the formation of the [[Zimbabwe National Army]] (ZNA) and [[Air Force of Zimbabwe]] (AFZ) as separate entities under the command of Rtd General [[Solomon Mujuru]] and Air Marshal [[Norman Walsh]] who retired in 1982, and was replaced by Air Marshal Azim Daudpota who handed over command to the late Rtd [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Josiah Tungamirai]] in 1985.

In December 2003, General Constantine Chiwenga, was promoted and appointed Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces. Lieutenant General P. V. Sibanda replaced him as Commander of the Army.&lt;ref name="minist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.gov.zw/zdf/zdf.htm |title=Zimbabwe Ministry of Defence|accessdate=17 November 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102151320/http://www.mod.gov.zw/zdf/zdf.htm|archivedate=2 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ZNA currently has an active duty strength of 30,000. The Air Force has about 5,139 standing personnel.&lt;ref name="Airforce of Zimbabwe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbabwedefence.com/AFZ0.html|title=Zimbabwe Defence Forces News|publisher=ZDF News|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zimbabwe Republic Police]] (includes Police Support Unit, Paramilitary Police) is part of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces and numbers 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbabwejournalists.com/story.php?art_id=3364&amp;cat=4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105170018/http://www.zimbabwejournalists.com/story.php?art_id=3364&amp;cat=4|archivedate=5 January 2008|title=MILITARISATION OF ZIMBABWE: Does the opposition stand a chance?|author=Chari, Freeman Forward|publisher=zimbabwejournalists.com|date=24 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following majority rule in early 1980, [[British Army]] trainers oversaw the integration of guerrilla fighters into a [[battalion]] structure overlaid on the existing Rhodesian armed forces. For the first year, a system was followed where the top-performing candidate became battalion commander. If he or she was from ZANLA, then his or her second-in-command was the top-performing ZIPRA candidate, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Godwin|authorlink=Peter Godwin (writer)|year=1996|title=Mukiwa – A White Boy in Africa|isbn=0-333-67150-3|publisher=Macmillan|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ensured a balance between the two movements in the command structure. From early 1981, this system was abandoned in favour of political appointments, and ZANLA and ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The ZNA was originally formed into four [[brigade]]s, composed of a total of 28 battalions. The brigade support units were composed almost entirely of specialists of the former Rhodesian Army, while unintegrated battalions of the [[Rhodesian African Rifles]] were assigned to the 1st, 3rd and 4th Brigades. The [[Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade|Fifth Brigade]] was formed in 1981 and disbanded in 1988 after the demonstration of mass brutality and murder during the brigade's occupation of [[Matabeleland]] in what has become known as [[Gukurahundi]] ({{Lang-sn|"the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains"}}), the campaign which finished off Mugabe's liberation struggle.&lt;ref name="watch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.gov.zw/army/zna.htm|title=Ministry of Defence, Zimbabwe|accessdate=11 November 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102184314/http://www.mod.gov.zw/army/zna.htm|archivedate=2 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brigade had been re-formed by 2006, with its commander, Brigadier-General John Mupande praising its "rich history".&lt;ref name="Herald Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zimbabwedefence.com/News_5th_Gets_Comm.html|publisher=Zimbabwe Defence Forces News|title=5th Brigade gets new commander|date=22 February 2006|accessdate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Provinces of Zimbabwe|Districts of Zimbabwe|Wards of Zimbabwe}}
[[File:Administrative Divisions of Zimbabwe.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|[[Provinces of Zimbabwe|Administrative divisions of Zimbabwe]]]]
Zimbabwe has a [[centralised government]] and is divided into eight provinces and two cities with provincial status, for administrative purposes. Each province has a provincial capital from where government administration is usually carried out.&lt;ref name="CIA-WF"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-

|-
| [[Matabeleland North]] || [[Lupane District]]
|-
| [[Matabeleland South]] || [[Gwanda]]
|-
| [[Midlands Province|Midlands]] || [[Gweru]]
|}

The names of most of the provinces were generated from the [[Mashonaland]] and [[Matabeleland]] divide at the time of colonisation: Mashonaland was the territory occupied first by the British South Africa Company Pioneer Column and Matabeleland the territory conquered during the [[First Matabele War]]. This corresponds roughly to the precolonial territory of the [[Shona people]] and the [[Matabele people]], although there are significant ethnic minorities in most provinces. Each province is headed by a Provincial Governor, appointed by the [[President of Zimbabwe|President]].&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/cms/UsefulResourses/ZimbabweConstitution.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221053703/http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/cms/UsefulResourses/ZimbabweConstitution.pdf|archivedate=21 December 2008|format=PDF|title=Constitution of the Republic of Zimbabwe|publisher=Parliament of Zimbabwe|accessdate=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provincial government is run by a Provincial Administrator, appointed by the Public Service Commission. Other government functions at provincial level are carried out by provincial offices of national government departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/attachments/article/116/PROVINCIAL_COUNCILS_AND_ADMINISTRATION_ACT_29_11.pdf|format=PDF|title=Provincial Councils and Administration Act (Chapter 29:11)|publisher=Parliament of Zimbabwe|accessdate=19 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227155122/http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/attachments/article/116/PROVINCIAL_COUNCILS_AND_ADMINISTRATION_ACT_29_11.pdf|archivedate=27 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provinces are subdivided into 59 [[Districts of Zimbabwe|districts]] and 1,200 [[Municipalities of Zimbabwe|wards]] (sometimes referred to as municipalities). Each district is headed by a District Administrator, appointed by the Public Service Commission. There is also a Rural District Council, which appoints a chief executive officer. The Rural District Council is composed of elected ward councillors, the District Administrator and one representative of the chiefs (traditional leaders appointed under customary law) in the district. Other government functions at district level are carried out by district offices of national government departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/attachments/article/116/RURAL_DISTRICT_COUNCILS_ACT_29_13.pdf|format=PDF|title=Rural District Councils Act (Chapter 29:13)|publisher=Parliament of Zimbabwe|accessdate=19 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227145728/http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/attachments/article/116/RURAL_DISTRICT_COUNCILS_ACT_29_13.pdf|archivedate=27 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the ward level there is a Ward Development Committee, comprising the elected ward councillor, the kraalheads (traditional leaders subordinate to chiefs) and representatives of Village Development Committees. Wards are subdivided into villages, each of which has an elected Village Development Committee and a Headman (traditional leader subordinate to the kraalhead).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/attachments/article/116/TRADITIONAL_LEADERS_ACT_29_17.pdf|format=PDF|title=Traditional Leaders Act (Chapter 29:17)|publisher=Parliament of Zimbabwe|accessdate=19 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904033010/http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/attachments/article/116/TRADITIONAL_LEADERS_ACT_29_17.pdf|archivedate=4 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism was an important industry for the country, but has been failing in recent years. The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force released a report in June 2007, estimating 60% of Zimbabwe's wildlife has died since 2000 due to poaching and deforestation. The report warns that the loss of life combined with widespread [[deforestation]] is potentially disastrous for the tourist industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zimbabwe's Wildlife Decimated by Economic Crisis|author=Wadhams, Nick|location=Nairobi|publisher=[[National Geographic News]]|date=1 August 2007|accessdate=5 August 2007|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/08/070801-zimbabwe-animals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
Zimbabwe's commercial farming sector was traditionally a source of exports and foreign exchange, and provided 400,000 jobs. However, the government's land reform program badly damaged the sector, turning Zimbabwe into a net importer of food products.&lt;ref name="CIA-WF"/&gt; For example, between 2000 and 2016 annual wheat production fell from 250,000 tons to 60,000 tons, maize was reduced from two million tons to 500,000 tons and cattle slaughtered for beef fell from 605,000 to 244,000.&lt;ref name="Out of House" /&gt; Coffee production, once a prized export commodity came to a virtual halt after seizure or expropriation of white-owned coffee farms in 2000, and has never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newsofthesouth.com/zimbabwes-coffee-production-declines/ |title=Zimbabwe`s Coffee Production Declines |last=Mumera |first=Wisdom |date=9 Jan 2016 |website=newsofhesouth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the past ten years, the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) has been assisting Zimbabwe's farmers to adopt [[conservation agriculture]] techniques, a sustainable method of farming that can help increase yields. By applying the three principles of minimum soil disturbance, legume-based cropping and the use of organic mulch, farmers can improve infiltration, reduce evaporation and soil erosion, and build up organic soil content.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Between 2005 and 2011, the number of smallholders practising conservation agriculture in Zimbabwe increased from 5000 to more than 150000. Cereal yields rose between 15 and 100 per cent across different regions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130916133602/http://eiard.org/media/uploads/File/Case%20studies/2013_SDC%20funded/ICRISAT%20-%20Conservation%20agriculture%20and%20micro-dosing%20in%20Zimbabwe.pdf ''Conservation agriculture and microdosing in Zimbabwe''], WRENmedia, January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform programme]] in 2000, tourism in Zimbabwe has steadily declined. After rising during the 1990s, (1.4 million tourists in 1999) industry figures described a 75% fall in visitors to Zimbabwe in 2000.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} By December, less than 20% of hotel rooms had been occupied.&lt;ref name="tourism"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1220218.stm|title=Sun sets on Zimbabwe tourism|author=Machipisa, Lewis|accessdate=16 November 2007|publisher=BBC News|date=14 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the total contribution of tourism to Zimbabwe was $1.1 billion (USD), or about 8.1% of Zimbabwe's GDP. It is expected to rise 1.4% in 2017. Employment in travel and tourism, as well as industries travel and tourism indirectly supports, was 5.2% of national employment and is expected to rise by 1.4% in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wttc.org/-/media/files/reports/economic-impact-research/countries-2017/zimbabwe2017.pdf|title=Travel and tourism: Economic impact 2017 Zimbabwe|last=|first=|date=March 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimbabwe has several major tourist attractions. [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]] on the [[Zambezi]], which are shared with Zambia, are located in the north west of Zimbabwe. Before the economic changes, much of the tourism for these locations came to the Zimbabwe side but now Zambia is the main beneficiary. The [[Victoria Falls National Park]] is also in this area and is one of the eight main [[national parks]] in Zimbabwe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbabwetourism.net/index.php/where-to-go/destinations/hwange-national-park|title=Zimbabwe Tourism Authority|accessdate=16 November 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203100122/http://www.zimbabwetourism.net/index.php/where-to-go/destinations/hwange-national-park|archivedate=3 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest of which is [[Hwange National Park]].

The [[Eastern Highlands]] are a series of mountainous areas near the border with [[Mozambique]]. The highest peak in Zimbabwe, [[Mount Nyangani]] at {{convert|2,593|m|ft|abbr=on}} is located here as well as the [[Bvumba Mountains]] and the [[Nyanga National Park]]. [[World's View, Nyanga|World's View]] is in these mountains and it is from here that places as far away as {{convert|60|–|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} are visible and, on clear days, the town of [[Rusape]] can be seen.

Zimbabwe is unusual in Africa in that there are a number of ancient ruined cities built in a unique [[dry stone]] style. The most famous of these are the [[Great Zimbabwe]] ruins in [[Masvingo]]. Other ruins include [[Khami|Khami Ruins, Zimbabwe]], [[Dhlo-Dhlo]] and [[Naletale]].

The [[Matobo National Park|Matobo Hills]] are an area of [[granite]] [[kopje]]s and wooded valleys commencing some {{convert|22|mi|km}} south of [[Bulawayo]] in southern Zimbabwe. The Hills were formed over 2,000 million years ago with granite being forced to the surface, then being eroded to produce smooth "whaleback dwalas" and broken kopjes, strewn with boulders and interspersed with thickets of vegetation. [[Mzilikazi]], founder of the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] nation, gave the area its name, meaning 'Bald Heads'. They have become famous and a tourist attraction due to their ancient shapes and local wildlife. [[Cecil Rhodes]] and other early white pioneers like [[Leander Starr Jameson]] are buried in these hills at a site named World's View.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zimbabwe.safari.co.za/spirit-of-zimbabwe.html|title=Zimbabwe: The Spirit of Matobo|work=zimbabwe.safari.co.za|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101100547/http://zimbabwe.safari.co.za/spirit-of-zimbabwe.html |archivedate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water supply and sanitation===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Zimbabwe}}
[[Water supply]] and [[sanitation]] in Zimbabwe is defined by many small scale successful programs but also by a general lack of improved water and [[sanitation]] systems for the majority of Zimbabwe. According to the [[World Health Organization]] in 2012, 80% of Zimbabweans had access to improved, i.e. clean, [[drinking-water]] sources, and only 40% of Zimbabweans had access to improved sanitation facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.167?lang=en "Exposure Data by Country"], World Health Organization; accessed 19 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Access to improved water supply and sanitation is distinctly less in rural areas.&lt;ref name=wsp1&gt;[http://www.wsp.org/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/CSO-Zimbabwe.pdf "Water Supply and Sanitation in Zimbabwe AMCOW.

There are many factors which continue to determine the nature, for the foreseeable future, of water supply and sanitation in Zimbabwe.

Three major factors are the severely depressed state of the Zimbabwean economy, the reluctance of foreign aid organizations to build and 
finance infrastructure projects, and the political instability of the Zimbabwean state.&lt;ref name="wsp1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw2"&gt;[http://	www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/zimbabwe1113_forUpload_1.pdf "Troubled Water Burst Pipes, Contaminated Wells, and Open Defecation in Zimbabwe’s Capital"], Human Rights Watch (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and technology ==
{{Main|Science and technology in Zimbabwe}}
Zimbabwe has relatively well-developed national infrastructure and a long-standing tradition of promoting research and development (R&amp;D), as evidenced by the levy imposed on tobacco-growers since the 1930s to promote market research.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002288/228806e.pdf|title=Mapping Research and Innovation in the Republic of Zimbabwe|editor-last=Lemarchand|editor-first=Guillermo A.|editor-last2=Schneegans|editor-first2=Susan|publisher=UNESCO|year=2014|isbn=978-92-3-100034-8|location=Paris|pages=Volume 2.

The country also has a well-developed education system, with one in eleven adults holding a tertiary degree. Given the country’s solid knowledge base and abundant natural resources, Zimbabwe has the potential to figure among the countries leading growth in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

To do so, however, Zimbabwe will need to correct a number of structural weaknesses.  For instance, it currently lacks the critical mass of researchers needed to trigger innovation. Although the infrastructure is in place to harness research and development to Zimbabwe’s socio-economic development, universities and research institutions lack the requisite financial and human resources to conduct research and the current regulatory environment hampers the transfer of new technologies to the business sector. The economic crisis has precipitated an exodus of university students and professionals in key areas of expertise (medicine, engineering, etc.) that is of growing concern. More than 22% of Zimbabwean tertiary students were completing their degrees abroad in 2012, compared to a 4% average for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. In 2012, there were 200 researchers (head count) employed in the public sector, one-quarter of whom were women. This is double the continental average (91 in 2013) but only one-quarter the researcher density of South Africa (818 per million inhabitants). The government has created the Zimbabwe Human Capital Website to provide information for the diaspora on job and investment opportunities in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Despite the fact that human resources are a pillar of any research and innovation policy, the ''Medium Term Plan'' ''2011–2015'' did not discuss any explicit policy for promoting postgraduate studies in science and engineering. The scarcity of new PhDs in science and engineering fields from the University of Zimbabwe in 2013 was symptomatic of this omission.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Nor does the development agenda to 2018, the ''Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Economic Transformation,'' contain any specific targets for increasing the number of scientists and engineers, or the staffing requirements for industry and other productive sectors. In addition, the lack of co-ordination and coherence among governance structures has led to a multiplication of research priorities and poor implementation of existing policies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The country's ''Second Science and Technology Policy'' was launched in June 2012, after being elaborated with UNESCO assistance. It replaces the earlier policy dating from 2002. The 2012 policy prioritizes biotechnology, information and communication technologies (ICTs), space sciences, nanotechnology, indigenous knowledge systems, technologies yet to emerge and scientific solutions to emergent environmental challenges. The ''Second Science and Technology Policy'' also asserts the government commitment to allocating at least 1% of GDP to research and development, focusing at least 60% of university education on developing skills in science and technology and ensuring that school pupils devote at least 30% of their time to studying science subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2014, Zimbabwe counted 21 publications per million inhabitants in internationally catalogued journals, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). This placed Zimbabwe sixth out of the 15 SADC countries, behind Namibia (59), Mauritius (71), Botswana (103) and, above all, South Africa (175) and the Seychelles (364). The average for sub-Saharan Africa was 20 scientific publications per million inhabitants, compared to a global average of 176 per million.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As in other African countries, Christianity may be mixed with enduring traditional beliefs. [[ancestor worship|Ancestral worship]] is the most practised non-Christian religion, involving [[spirituality|spiritual]] intercession; the [[mbira|mbira dzavadzimu]], which means "voice of the ancestors", an instrument related to many [[lamellophone]]s ubiquitous throughout Africa, is central to many ceremonial proceedings. Mwari simply means "God the Creator" (musika vanhu in Shona). Around 1% of the population is Muslim.&lt;ref name = "US_state"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51503.htm |title =Zimbabwe – International Religious Freedom Report 2005|accessdate=3 December 2007 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |quote=An estimated 1% of the total population is Muslim. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Women and children at a borehole.jpg|thumb|left|A group of women and children in Norton, Zimbabwe]]
Bantu-speaking ethnic groups make up 98% of the population. The majority people, the [[Shona people|Shona]], comprise 70%. The [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] are the second most populous with 20% of the population.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholars.nus.edu.sg/post/zimbabwe/zpeople.html|title=The People of Zimbabwe|accessdate=13 November 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712141810/http://www.scholars.nus.edu.sg/post/zimbabwe/zpeople.html|archivedate=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108169.html|title=Ethnicity/Race of Zimbabwe|accessdate=6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ndebele descended from [[Zulu people|Zulu]] migrations in the 19th century and the other tribes with which they intermarried. Up to one million Ndebele may have left the country over the last five years, mainly for South Africa. Other [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] ethnic groups make up the third largest with 2 to 5%: these are [[Venda]], [[Tonga language (Zambia and Zimbabwe)|Tonga]], [[Shangaan]], [[Kalanga language|Kalanga]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], [[Ndau language|Ndau]], [[Nambya]], [[Tswana language|Tswana]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Lozi language|Lozi]].&lt;ref name="ethnic"/&gt;

Minority ethnic groups include [[White people in Zimbabwe|white Zimbabweans]], who make up less than 1% of the total population. White Zimbabweans are mostly of British origin, but there are also [[Afrikaner]], [[Greeks in Zimbabwe|Greek]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Franco-Mauritian|French]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] communities. The white population dropped from a peak of around 278,000 or 4.3% of the population in 1975&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, David and Isaacman, Allen F. (1981).

===Refugee crisis===
The economic meltdown and repressive political measures in Zimbabwe have led to a flood of refugees into neighbouring countries. An estimated 3.4 million Zimbabweans, a quarter of the population, had fled abroad by mid-2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,2115988,00.html|title=Refugees flood from Zimbabwe ''The Observer''|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK|first=Andrew|last=Meldrum|date=1 July 2007|accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 3,000,000 of these left for South Africa and Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sokwanele.com/articles/sokwanele/zimrefugeessufferinsouthafricaandzimbabwe_20July2007.html|title=Zimbabwean refugees suffer in Botswana and South Africa|work=Sokwanele Civic Action Group|date=20 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003255/http://www.sokwanele.com/articles/sokwanele/zimrefugeessufferinsouthafricaandzimbabwe_20July2007.html|archivedate=28 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Languages of Zimbabwe}}
[[English language|English]] is the main language used in the education and judiciary systems. The [[Bantu languages]] [[Shona language|Shona]] and [[Northern Ndebele language|Sindebele]] are the principal indigenous languages of Zimbabwe. [[Shona language|Shona]] is spoken by 70% of the population, [[Northern Ndebele language|Sindebele]] by 20%. Other minority Bantu languages include [[Venda]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Shangaan]], [[Kalanga language|Kalanga]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], [[Ndau language|Ndau]] and [[Nambya]].

An estimated 80% of the country's citizens identify themselves as Christians. Protestants (mostly followers of Pentecostal African Churches) are around 63% of the population. Estimates from 2005 said there were 1,145,000 Roman Catholics in Zimbabwe. This is about 9% of the total population. The followers of ethnic religions are around 11%. Around 1% are Muslims, mainly from Mozambique and Malawi, 0.1% are [[Hindus]] and 0.3% are [[Baha'is]]. Approximately 7% of citizens have no religious practice or are atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/zimbabwe#/?affiliations_religion_id=0&amp;affiliations_year=2010&amp;region_name=All%20Countries&amp;restrictions_year=2013|title=Zimbabwe in PEW-Templeton Global Religious Futures Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_246_1.asp|title=Zimbabwe in ARDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|title=Zimbabwe at "International Religious Freedom Report", USA Departament of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Zimbabwe}}
Zimbabwe has many different cultures which may include [[beliefs]] and [[ceremonies]], one of them being [[Shona people|Shona]], Zimbabwe's largest ethnic group. The Shona people have many sculptures and [[rock carving|carvings]] which are made with the finest materials available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ag_85hJI9aMC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=zimbabwe+shona#v=onepage&amp;q=zimbabwe%20shona&amp;f=false|title=The Soul of Mbira: Music and Traditions of the Shona People of Zimbabwe|last=Berliner|first=Paul|date=June 1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226043791|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimbabwe first celebrated its independence on 18 April 1980.&lt;ref name="indepday"&gt;{{cite book|last=Owomoyela|first=Oyekan|year=2002|title=Culture and Customs of Zimbabwe|page=77|isbn=0-313-31583-3|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrations are held at either the [[National Sports Stadium (Zimbabwe)|National Sports Stadium]] or [[Rufaro Stadium]] in Harare. The first independence celebrations were held in 1980 at the Zimbabwe Grounds. At these celebrations, [[dove]]s are released to symbolise peace and fighter jets fly over and the [[National Anthem of Zimbabwe|national anthem]] is sung. The flame of independence is lit by the president after parades by the presidential family and members of the armed forces of Zimbabwe. The president also gives a speech to the people of Zimbabwe which is televised for those unable to attend the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kas.de/proj/home/home/35/2/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010093006/http://www.kas.de/proj/home/home/35/2/|archivedate=10 October 2006|title=Zimbabwe Celebrates 25 years of Independence|accessdate=6 January 2008|publisher=Konrad Adenauer Stiftung}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimbabwe also has a national beauty pageant, the [[Miss Heritage Zimbabwe]] contest which has been held annually ever since 2012.

===Arts===

[[File:Reconciliation Amos Supuni Woerden.jpg|thumb|"Reconciliation", a [[stone sculpture]] by [[Amos Supuni]]]]
Traditional arts in Zimbabwe include [[pottery]], [[basketry]], textiles, jewellery and carving. Among the distinctive qualities are symmetrically patterned woven baskets and stools carved out of a single piece of wood. Shona sculpture has become world-famous in recent years having found popularity in the 1940s. Most subjects of [[rock carving|carved]] figures of stylised birds and human figures among others are made with [[sedimentary]] rocks such as [[soapstone]], as well as harder [[igneous]] rocks such as [[serpentine group|serpentine]] and the rare stone [[Serpentinite|verdite]]. Zimbabwean artefacts can be found  in countries like Singapore, China and Canada. e.g. [[Dominic Benhura]]'s statue in the [[Singapore Botanic Gardens]].

Shona sculpture in has survived through the ages and the modern style is a fusion of African [[folklore]] with European influences. World-renowned Zimbabwean sculptors include Nicholas, Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi and Locardia Ndandarika. Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence a new generation of artists, particularly Black Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists like New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by some Black artists of past generations in the United States.

Several authors are well known within Zimbabwe and abroad. [[Charles Mungoshi]] is renowned in Zimbabwe for writing traditional stories in English and in Shona and his poems and books have sold well with both the black and white communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zimbabwe.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=5752|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016092853/http://zimbabwe.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=5752|archivedate=16 October 2007|title=Charles Mungoshi|publisher=Zimbabwe – Poetry International Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine Buckle]] has achieved international recognition with her two books ''African Tears'' and ''Beyond Tears'' which tell of the ordeal she went through under the 2000 [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|Land Reform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africantears.netfirms.com/beyondtears.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030001000/http://africantears.netfirms.com/beyondtears.htm|archivedate=30 October 2007|title=Tribute to Cathy Buckle|accessdate=2 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia]], [[Ian Smith]], wrote two books &lt;nowiki&gt; – &lt;/nowiki&gt; ''[[The Great Betrayal: The Memoirs of Ian Douglas Smith|The Great Betrayal]]'' and ''[[Bitter Harvest (2001 book)|Bitter Harvest]].'' The book ''[[The House of Hunger]]'' by [[Dambudzo Marechera]] won an award in the UK in 1979 and the Nobel Prize-winning author [[Doris Lessing]]'s first novel ''[[The Grass Is Singing]]'', the first four volumes of  ''[[The Children of Violence]]'' sequence, as well as the collection of short stories ''African Stories'' are set in Rhodesia. In 2013 NoViolet Bulawayo's novel ''We Need New Names'' was shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]].

===Cuisine===
[[File:Goat Offal.JPG|thumb|A meal of sadza ''(right)'', greens, and goat [[offal]].  The goat's small intestines are wrapped around small pieces of large intestines before cooking.]]
Like in many African countries, the majority of Zimbabweans depend on a few staple foods. "Mealie meal", also known as [[cornmeal]], is used to prepare ''[[sadza]]'' or ''isitshwala'', as well as [[porridge]] known as ''bota'' or ''ilambazi''. Sadza is made by mixing the cornmeal with water to produce a thick paste/porridge. After the paste has been cooking for several minutes, more cornmeal is added to thicken the paste.

This is usually eaten as lunch or dinner, usually with sides such as [[gravy]], [[vegetable]]s ([[spinach]], [[chomolia]], or [[spring greens]]/[[collard greens]]), [[bean]]s, and [[meat]] (stewed, grilled, roasted, or sundried). Sadza is also commonly eaten with curdled milk ([[sour milk]]), commonly known as "lacto" (''mukaka wakakora''), or dried [[Tanganyika sardine]], known locally as ''kapenta'' or ''matemba''. Bota is a thinner porridge, cooked without the additional cornmeal and usually flavoured with [[peanut butter]], milk, butter, or [[jam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zambuko.com/mbirapage/resource_guide/pages/culture/sadza_text.html | publisher=Zambuko.com |title=Sadza ne Nyama: A Shona Staple Dish |accessdate=3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bota is usually eaten for breakfast.

[[Graduation]]s, [[wedding]]s, and any other family gatherings will usually be celebrated with the killing of a goat or cow, which will be barbecued or [[Roasting|roasted]] by the family.

[[File:Boerewors raw.jpg|thumb|Raw [[boerewors]]]]
Even though the [[Afrikaner]]s are a small group (10%) within the white minority group, Afrikaner recipes are popular. [[Biltong]], a type of [[Jerky (food)|jerky]], is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephanie Hanes|title=Biltong: much more than just a snack|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=20 September 2006|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0920/p13s01-lifo.html|accessdate=3 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boerewors]] is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have [[porridge]] in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked ''sadza'', or sandwiches (which is more common in the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for [[tea]] to be had after dinner.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Rice, pasta, and [[Potato production in Zimbabwe|potato-based foods]] ([[french fries]] and [[mashed potato]]) also make up part of Zimbabwean cuisine. A local favourite is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken with thick gravy, mixed vegetables and meat.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} A potpourri of peanuts known as ''nzungu'', boiled and sundried maize, [[black-eyed pea]]s known as ''nyemba'', and [[bambara groundnut]]s known as ''nyimo'' makes a traditional dish called ''mutakura''. Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks, such as ''maputi'' (roasted/popped maize kernels similar to [[popcorn]]), roasted and salted [[peanut]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[sweet potato]], pumpkin, and indigenous fruits, such as [[horned melon]], ''gaka'', ''[[adansonia]]'', ''mawuyu'', ''[[uapaca kirkiana]]'', ''mazhanje'' (sugar plum), and many others.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The team is ranked 115th in the world (Fifa World Rankings Nov 2018).

[[Rugby union]] is a significant sport in Zimbabwe. [[Zimbabwe national rugby union team|The national side]] have represented the country at 2 [[Rugby World Cup]] tournaments in 1987 and 1991. The team are currently ranked 26 in the world by World Rugby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldrugby.org/rankings|title=World Rugby|first=|last=worldrugby.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cricket]] also has a following among the white minority. It is one of twelve [[Test cricket]] playing nations and a [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] full member as well. Notable cricket players from Zimbabwe include [[Andy Flower]], [[Heath Streak]] and [[Brendan Taylor]].

Zimbabwe has won eight Olympic medals, one in [[field hockey]] [[Zimbabwe women's national field hockey team|with the women's team]] at the [[Zimbabwe at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, and seven  by swimmer [[Kirsty Coventry]], three at the [[Zimbabwe at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]] and four at the [[Zimbabwe at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]].

Zimbabwe has also done well in the [[Commonwealth Games]] and [[All-Africa Games]] in swimming with Kirsty Coventry obtaining 11 gold medals in the different competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2004/schedules/117BySport.html |title=2004 Olympic Games swimming results |accessdate=22 July 2007 |publisher=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509051921/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2004/schedules/117BySport.html |archivedate=9 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fina.org/events/WC/Montreal_2005/results/sw.php |title=Montreal 2005 Results|accessdate=9 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070128064425/http://www.fina.org/events/WC/Montreal_2005/results/sw.php |archivedate = 28 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fina.org/events/WC/Melbourne_2007/results/swimming.php|title=12th FINA World Championships|accessdate=9 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070606111744/http://www.fina.org/events/WC/Melbourne_2007/results/swimming.php |archivedate = 6 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/commonwealthgames2002/bsp/statistics/results.stm |title=BBC Sport Commonwealth Games 2002 Statistics|accessdate=29 August 2007 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimbabwe has also competed at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and the [[Davis Cup]] in tennis, most notably with the Black family, which comprises [[Wayne Black]], [[Byron Black]] and [[Cara Black]]. Zimbabwe has also done well in golf. The Zimbabwean [[Nick Price]] held the official World Number 1 status longer than any player from Africa has ever done in the 24-year history of the ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gold |first=Jack Of |url=http://www.freetv4africa.co.uk/2012/05/africa-punching-above-its-weight-in.html |title=Africa punching above it's &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; weight in golf |publisher=Free TV 4 Africa |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208110629/http://www.freetv4africa.co.uk/2012/05/africa-punching-above-its-weight-in.html |archivedate=8 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sports played in Zimbabwe are basketball, volleyball, [[netball]], and [[water polo]], as well as [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[motorsport]], martial arts, [[chess]], cycling, [[polocrosse]], [[kayaking]] and [[horse racing]]. However, most of these sports do not have international representatives but instead stay at a junior or national level.

Zimbabwean professional [[rugby league]] players currently playing overseas are [[Masimbaashe Motongo]] and [[Judah Mazive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/hull-fc-masimbaashe-matongo-s-dream-journey-just/story-28185324-detail/story.html|title=From Zimbabwe to Hull FC: Masimbaashe Matongo's 'dream' journey is just beginning|date=17 November 2015|newspaper=Hull Daily Mail|accessdate=18 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225200610/http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Hull-FC-Masimbaashe-Matongo-s-dream-journey-just/story-28185324-detail/story.html|archivedate=25 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zimbabwe-today.com/2016/10/sports/zimbabwe-teenager-judah-mazive-signs-contract-play-rugby-england/|title=Zimbabwe teenager Judah Mazive signs contract to play rugby in England|newspaper=Zimbabwe Today|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113154539/http://zimbabwe-today.com/2016/10/sports/zimbabwe-teenager-judah-mazive-signs-contract-play-rugby-england/|archivedate=13 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former players include now [[SANZAAR]] CEO [[Andy Marinos]] who made an appearance for [[South Africa national rugby league team|South Africa]] at the [[Super League World Nines]] and featured for the [[Sydney Bulldogs]] as well as Zimbabwe-born former [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland rugby union international]] [[Scott Gray (rugby union)|Scott Gray]], who spent time at the [[Brisbane Broncos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superxv.com/south-africas-marinos-appointed-new-sanzar-ceo/|title=South Africa's Marinos appointed new SANZAR CEO – Super Rugby – Super 18 Rugby and Rugby Championship News, Results and Fixtures from Super XV Rugby|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
{{Main|Media of Zimbabwe}}
The media of Zimbabwe is now once again diverse, having come under tight restriction between 2002 and 2008 by the government during the growing economic and political crisis in the country. The Zimbabwean constitution promises freedom of the media and expression. Since the appointment of a new media and information minister in 2013 the media is currently facing less political interference and the supreme court has ruled some sections of the strict media laws as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court strikes down repressive media legislation|url=http://cpj.org/2003/05/supreme-court-strikes-down-repressive-media-legisl.php|website=Committee to Protect Journalist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009 the BBC and CNN were able to resume operations and report legally and openly from Zimbabwe. CNN welcomed the move. The Zimbabwe Ministry of Media, Information and Publicity stated that, "the Zimbabwe government never banned the BBC from carrying out lawful activities inside Zimbabwe".&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; The BBC also welcomed the move saying, "we're pleased at being able to operate openly in Zimbabwe once again".&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Williams, Jon |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2009/07/resuming_operations_in_zimbabw.html |title=Resuming operations in Zimbabwe |publisher=BBC |date= 29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the Zimbabwe Media Commission was established by the inclusive, power-sharing government. In May 2010 the Commission licensed three new privately owned newspapers, including the previously banned ''[[Daily News (Harare)|Daily News]]'', for publication.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64P5NX20100526 |title=Zimbabwe licenses new private newspapers |agency=Reuters |date=26 May 2010|author=Banya, Nelson }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporters Without Borders described the decisions as a "major advance".&lt;ref name="IFEX"&gt;[http://www.ifex.org/zimbabwe/2010/05/28/licences_granted/ "independent dailies allowed to resume publishing"], ''[[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]]'', 28 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010 ''[[NewsDay (Zimbabwean newspaper)|NewsDay]]'' became the first independent daily newspaper to be published in Zimbabwe in seven years.&lt;ref name="Reuter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE65312720100604 |title=Zimbabwe gets first private daily newspaper in years |agency=Reuters |date=4 June 2010|author=Chinaka, Cris }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZBC's monopoly in the broadcasting sector was ended with the licensing of two private radio stations in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Finally, Zimbabwe’s ‘private’ radio station goes on air |url=http://www.zimeye.org/finally-zimbabwes-private-radio-station-goes-on-air/ |publisher=zimeye.org |date=26 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725060843/http://www.zimeye.org/finally-zimbabwes-private-radio-station-goes-on-air/ |archivedate=25 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2002 Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) was passed, a number of privately owned news outlets were shut down by the government, including ''[[Daily News (Harare)|Daily News]]'' whose managing director Wilf Mbanga went on to form the influential [[The Zimbabwean]].&lt;ref name="rwb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cgmg"&gt;Ruzengwe, Blessing  (17 March 2005) [https://web.archive.org/web/20060301060504/http://cgmg.jour.city.ac.uk/news.php?story=249 "The nine lives of Wilf Mbanga"], ''The London Globe'' via ''[[Metrovox]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many press organisations have been set up in both neighbouring and Western countries by [[exile]]d Zimbabweans. Because the internet is currently unrestricted, many Zimbabweans are allowed to access online news sites set up by exiled journalists.&lt;ref name="fh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=251&amp;year=2007 |title=Freedom House 2007 Map of Press Freedom: Zimbabwe |publisher=Freedomhouse.org|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reporters Without Borders]] claims the media environment in Zimbabwe involves "surveillance, threats, [[imprison]]ment, censorship, [[blackmail]], abuse of power and denial of [[justice]] are all brought to bear to keep firm control over the news."&lt;ref name="rwb" /&gt; The main published newspapers are [[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|''The Herald'']] and [[The Chronicle (Zimbabwe)|''The Chronicle'']] which are printed in Harare and Bulawayo respectively. The heavy-handedness on the media has progressively relaxed since 2009.

In its 2008 report, [[Reporters Without Borders]] ranked the Zimbabwean media as 151st out of 173.&lt;ref name="rwb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=29031 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101010153/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=29031 |archivedate=1 November 2008 |title=Reporters without Borders Press Freedom Index |publisher=Reports Without Borders |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also bans many foreign broadcasting stations from Zimbabwe, including the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], [[Sky News]], [[Channel 4]], [[American Broadcasting Company]], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)]], and [[Fox News]]. News agencies and newspapers from other Western countries and South Africa have also been banned from the country.

=== Scouting ===
{{Main|The Scout Association of Zimbabwe}}
[[File:Burnham sketch by baden-powell.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]]'s drawing of Chief of Scouts [[Frederick Russell Burnham|Burnham]], [[Matobo Hills]], 1896]]
It was in the [[Matabeleland]] region in Zimbabwe that, during the [[Second Matabele War]], [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], the founder of [[Scouting]], and [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], the American-born Chief of Scouts for the British Army, first met and began their lifelong friendship.&lt;ref name="scouting"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burnham |first=Frederick Russell |authorlink=Frederick Russell Burnham |title=Scouting on Two Continents |publisher=Doubleday, Page &amp; company |year=1926 |page=2; Chapters 3 &amp; 4 |oclc=407686}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-June 1896, during a scouting patrol in the [[Matobo Hills]], Burnham began teaching Baden-Powell [[woodcraft]]. Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, [[tracking (hunting)|tracking]], [[fieldcraft]], and self-reliance.&lt;ref name="vanwyk"&gt;{{cite book |last=van Wyk |first=Peter |year=2003|url=http://www.burnhamkingofscouts.com/| title=Burnham: King of Scouts |publisher=Trafford Publishing |isbn=1-4122-0028-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during this time in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature [[campaign hat]] like the one worn by Burnham.&lt;ref name="jeal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Tim |last=Jeal |authorlink=Tim Jeal |title=Baden-Powell |publisher=[[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]] |location=London |year=1989 |isbn=0-09-170670-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scouting in the former [[Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] started in 1909 when the first Boy Scout troop was registered. Scouting grew quickly and in 1924 Rhodesia and Nyasaland sent a large contingent to the second [[World Scout Jamboree]] in [[Ermelunden, Denmark]]. In 1959, Rhodesia hosted the Central African Jamboree at [[Ruwa]]. In 2009, Scouts celebrated 100 years of Scouting in Zimbabwe and hundreds of Scouts camped at [[Gordon Park, Zimbabwe|Gordon Park]], a Scout campground and training area, as part of these celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zimbabwe Scouts celebrate their centenary in a park that Baden-Powell had visited in 1936|url=http://www.scout.org/en/around_the_world/africa/information_events/news/zimbabwe_scouts_celebrate_their_centenary_in_a_park_that_b_p_once_visited|accessdate=26 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927163223/http://www.undp.org.zw/component/docman/doc_download/230-zimbabwe-poverty-report-2011-april-17-2013 |archivedate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides scouting, there are also leadership, life skills and general knowledge courses and training experiences mainly for school children ranging from pre-school to final year high school students and some times those beyond High school. These courses and outings are held at, for example, ''Lasting Impressions'' ({{YouTube|Q5GiuX0O_so|Lasting Impressions ~Zimbabwe}}), ''Far and Wide Zimbabwe'' ([http://www.farandwide.co.zw/ Far and wide.]) and ''Chimanimani Outward Bound'' ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616100110/http://www.outwardbound.net/locations/zimbabwe.php |date=16 June 2007 |title=Outwardbound Zimbabwe }}).

===National symbols===
[[File:Zimbabwe Bird.svg|thumb|upright|Traditional Zimbabwe Bird design]]
The stone-carved [[Zimbabwe Bird]] appears on the national flags and the coats of arms of both Zimbabwe and [[Rhodesia]], as well as on [[Rhodesian dollar|banknotes]] and coins (first on [[Coins of the Rhodesian pound|Rhodesian pound]] and then [[Coins of the Rhodesian dollar|Rhodesian dollar]]). It probably represents the [[Bateleur|bateleur eagle]] or the [[African fish eagle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Soapstone Birds from Great Zimbabwe|journal=African Arts|year=1985|volume=18|pages=68–73, 99–100|author=Huffman, Thomas N.|jstor=3336358|issue=3|doi=10.2307/3336358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: The Soapstone Birds of Great Zimbabwe Symbols of a Nation by Edward Matenga|journal=The South African Archaeological Bulletin|year=2001|volume=56|pages=105–106|author=Sinclair, Paul |jstor=3889033|issue=173/174|doi=10.2307/3889033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous [[soapstone]] bird carvings stood on walls and monoliths of the ancient city of [[Great Zimbabwe]], built, it is believed, sometime between the 13th and 16th centuries by ancestors of the [[Shona people|Shona]]. The ruins, which gave their name to modern Zimbabwe, cover some {{convert|1800|acre|km2}} and are the largest ancient stone construction in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Zimbabwe|url=http://usp.nus.edu.sg/post/zimbabwe/art/greatzim/gz1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809145423/http://usp.nus.edu.sg/post/zimbabwe/art/greatzim/gz1.html|archivedate=9 August 2007|author=Landow, George P.|publisher=Brown University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Balancing Rocks]] are geological formations all over Zimbabwe. The rocks are perfectly balanced without other supports. They are created when ancient granite intrusions are exposed to weathering, as softer rocks surrounding them erode away. They are often remarked on and have been depicted on both the [[banknotes of Zimbabwe]] and the [[Rhodesian dollar]] banknotes. The ones found on the current notes of Zimbabwe, named the Banknote Rocks, are located in [[Epworth, Zimbabwe|Epworth]], approximately {{convert|9|mi|km}} south east of Harare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.fortunecity.com/madzimbabwe/Buildings/Natural/Balancing%20Rocks/BalancingRocks.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817012750/http://members.fortunecity.com/madzimbabwe/Buildings/Natural/Balancing%20Rocks/BalancingRocks.html|archivedate=17 August 2009|title=Balancing Rocks|accessdate=15 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different formations of the rocks, incorporating single and paired columns of 3 or more rocks. These formations are a feature of south and east tropical Africa from northern South Africa northwards to [[Sudan]]. The most notable formations in Zimbabwe are located in the [[Matobo National Park]] in [[Matabeleland]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The [[National Anthem of Zimbabwe]] is "Blessed be the Land of Zimbabwe" ({{Lang-sn|"Simudzai Mureza wedu WeZimbabwe"}}; {{Lang-nd|"Kalibusiswe Ilizwe leZimbabwe"}}). It was introduced in March 1994 after a nationwide competition to replace "{{Lang|sn|[[Ishe Komborera Africa]]}}" as a distinctly Zimbabwean song. The winning entry was a song written by Professor [[Solomon Mutswairo]] and composed by Fred Changundega. It has been translated into all three of the main languages of Zimbabwe.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

At independence, the policies of racial inequality were reflected in the disease patterns of the black majority.

Zimbabwe suffered occasional outbreaks of acute diseases (such as [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in 1994). The gains on the national health were eroded by structural adjustment in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Marquette, C.M. |year=1997|doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(97)00019-3 |title=Current poverty, structural adjustment, and drought in Zimbabwe|journal=World Development|volume=25|pages=1141–1149|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of the [[HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe|HIV/AIDS pandemic]]&lt;ref name="nofix" /&gt; and the economic crisis since the year 2000.

==Education==

Due to large investments in education since independence, Zimbabwe has the highest adult literacy rate in Africa which in 2013 was 90.70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ranking of African Countries By Literacy Rate: Zimbabwe No. 1|url=http://theafricaneconomist.com/ranking-of-african-countries-by-literacy-rate-zimbabwe-no-1/|publisher=The African Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is lower than the 92% recorded in 2010 by the [[United Nations Development Programme]]&lt;ref name="IRINAfrica"&gt;[http://ww.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=89947 "Unlicensed and outdoors or no school at all"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511094256/http://ww.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=89947 |date=11 May 2011 }}, irinnews.org, 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AllAfrica"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201007150032.html "Zimbabwe: Country Leads in Africa Literacy Race"], AllAfrica.com, 14 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 97.0% recorded in the 2002 census, while still substantially higher than 80.4% recorded in the 1992 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Poverty Income Consumption and Expenditure Survey 2011/12 Report|publisher=Zimstat|year=2013|url=http://www.undp.org.zw/component/docman/doc_download/230-zimbabwe-poverty-report-2011-april-17-2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927163223/http://www.undp.org.zw/component/docman/doc_download/230-zimbabwe-poverty-report-2011-april-17-2013 |archivedate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The education department has stated that 20,000 teachers have left Zimbabwe since 2007 and that half of Zimbabwe's children have not progressed beyond primary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/09/25/zimbabwe.schools/index.html|author=Nkepile Mabuse|title=Zimbabwe schools begin fightback|accessdate=28 September 2009|publisher=CNN|date=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wealthier portion of the population usually send their children to independent schools as opposed to the [[government school|government-run]] schools which are attended by the majority as these are subsidized by the government. School education was made free in 1980, but since 1988, the government has steadily increased the charges attached to school enrollment until they now greatly exceed the real value of fees in 1980. The Ministry of Education of Zimbabwe maintains and operates the government schools but the fees charged by independent schools are regulated by the cabinet of Zimbabwe.

Zimbabwe's education system consists of 2 years of pre-school, 7 years of primary and 6 years of secondary schooling before students can enter university in the country or abroad. The academic year in Zimbabwe runs from January to December, with three terms, broken up by one month holidays, with a total of 40 weeks of school per year. National examinations are written during the third term in November, with [[General Certificate of Education|"O" level]] and [[Advanced Level (UK)|"A" level]] subjects also offered in June.&lt;ref name="embassy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harare.usembassy.gov/zimbabwe_educational_profile.html |title=Zimbabwe US Embassy |accessdate=15 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118190900/http://harare.usembassy.gov/zimbabwe_educational_profile.html |archivedate=18 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are seven public (Government) universities as well as four church-related universities in Zimbabwe that are fully internationally accredited.&lt;ref name="embassy" /&gt; The [[University of Zimbabwe]], the first and largest, was built in 1952 and is located in the Harare suburb of [[Mount Pleasant, Harare|Mount Pleasant]]. Notable [[alumni]] from Zimbabwean universities include [[Welshman Ncube]]; Peter Moyo (of Amabhubesi); [[Tendai Biti]], [[Chenjerai Hove]], Zimbabwean poet, novelist and essayist; and [[Arthur Mutambara]]. Many of the current politicians in the government of Zimbabwe have obtained degrees from universities in USA or other universities abroad.

[[National University of Science and Technology, Zimbabwe|National University of Science and Technology]] (NUST) is the second largest public research university in Zimbabwe located in Bulawayo. It was established in 1991. The National University of Science and Technology strives to become a flourishing and reputable institution not only in Zimbabwe and in Southern Africa but also among the international fraternity of Universities. Its guidance, cultural values is the encouragement of all its members and society of those attitudes of fair mindedness, understanding, tolerance and respect for people and views which are essential for the attainment and maintenance of justice, peace and harmony at all times.

[[Africa University]] is a United Methodist related university institution located in Manicaland which attracts students from at least 36 African countries. The institution has been growing steadily and has steady study material and learning facilities. 
The highest professional board for accountants is the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe]] (ICAZ) with direct relationships with similar bodies in South Africa, Canada, the UK and Australia. A qualified [[Chartered Accountant]] from Zimbabwe is also a member of similar bodies in these countries after writing a conversion paper. In addition, Zimbabwean-trained doctors only require one year of residence to be fully licensed doctors in the United States. The [[Zimbabwe Institution of Engineers]] (ZIE) is the highest professional board for engineers.

Education in Zimbabwe became under threat since the economic changes in 2000 with teachers going on strike because of low pay, students unable to concentrate because of hunger and the price of uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury. Teachers were also one of the main targets of Mugabe's attacks because he thought they were not strong supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6566919.stm |title=BBC report on 40 years in Zimbabwe's schools |accessdate=3 November 2007 | date=19 April 2007 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
