      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25277">The '''19th-century Catholic periodical literature''' is unique in many respects. Most of the [[periodical publication]]s in mainly Catholic countries can be regarded as "Catholic" literature up to a few decades before 1800: the editorial line is implicitly Catholic in most instances.

The development of the press in the 19th century was in general terms a major factor in [[secularization]] according to [[Owen Chadwick]]. On the other hand, mass printing also meant that the "Pope of 1889 was far more influential that the Pope of 1839 because the later Pope was surrounded by the press and the earlier Pope was not" wrote Chadwick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Secularization of the European Mind in the Nineteenth Century |first=Owen |last=Chadwick |authorlink=Owen Chadwick |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1975 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' of 1913 offered an analysis in terms of several factors. [[Periodical literature]] includes the political newspaper, the weekly, and literary and specialized magazines and journals appearing less frequently: in some countries such as Spain the implicit Catholicism persisted in the press for many years. The American-style, news-led paper would sell on its news content, rather than editorial line, and therefore Catholic newspapers could compete as dailies. European papers and weeklies relied more on the ''[[feuilleton]]'' and generally had more [[op-ed]] content. This meant they showed "greater animosity to the Church".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11669b.htm |title=Catholic Periodical Literature |journal=Catholic Encyclopedia |year=1911 |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

===19th-century England===
The pioneer Catholic publication in England, ''Andrews' Orthodox Journal'', was first issued in 1812 by [[William Eusebius Andrews|Eusebius Andrews]], a Catholic printer and bookseller of London. It had just a few years of chequered existence, as there was not a sufficiently large reading public to make it self-supporting.

The real beginnings of Catholic periodical literature were made more than twenty years later, by which time the growth of the Catholic body in its new emancipation, the progress of Catholic education, and the interest excited by the [[Tractarian movement]] had combined to supply a wider circle of readers. [[Nicholas Wiseman]] and [[Daniel O'Connell]] founded a [[quarterly]], the ''[[Dublin Review (Catholic periodical)|Dublin Review]]'' (1836). The fame of the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' suggested a territorial title, and Dublin was chosen as a Catholic centre; but from the first it was edited and published in London. The review was intended to provide a record of current thought for educated Catholics and at the same time to be an exponent of Catholic views to non-Catholic inquirers. Beginning before the first stirrings of the [[Oxford Movement]], it presents a record of the intellectual life of the century and produced articles which had an immense influence upon the religious thought of the times. It was in August 1839 that an article by Wiseman on the [[Anglican Claim]] caught the attention of [[John Henry Newman]]. Impressed by the application of the words of St. Augustine, ''securus judicat orbis terrarum'', which interpreted and summed up the course of ecclesiastical history, he saw the theory of the Via media "absolutely pulverized" (Apologia, 116-7). I

Gradually the Tractarian converts appeared in the lists of contributors: Ward, [[Frederick Oakeley]], Marshall, [[John Brande Morris]], Christie, [[Henry Formby]], Capes, [[Thomas William Allies]], Anderson, Manning, and a glance through the volumes of the "Dublin' will reveal names prominent in the great religious, scientific, and literary movements of the century. During the sixties and the early seventies it was under the direction of Dr. [[W. G. Ward]]. After his retirement it was edited by [[John Cuthbert Hedley]], afterwards [[Bishop of Newport]], and then acquired by [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]], who appointed [[Canon Moyes]] editor. It was the property and under the direction of [[Wilfrid Ward]], son of its previous editor.

The first issue of the annual ''[[Catholic Directory]]'' appeared in 1837. Owing to the Oxford Movement, the forties were a time of marked literary activity. In 1840 two new enterprises were inaugurated. Mr. Dolman, a Catholic publisher in London who had issued a number of important books including the writings of [[John Lingard]] and [[Husenbeth]], produced in "Dolman's Magazine" a high class literary monthly, and on 16 May 1840, [[Frederick Lucas]] became the pioneer of the Catholic newspaper press in England by publishing the first number of ''[[The Tablet]]'', a weekly newspaper and review. Lucas regarded his work as founder and editor of a Catholic paper as a sacred mission. His uncompromising views led to difficulties with his financial supporters, but he emerged triumphant.

For a while after the crisis of 1848 Lucas, then active in Irish politics, removed ''The Tablet'' office to Dublin, but it was brought back to London by the new proprietors, into whose hands it passed when failing health compelled Lucas to give up the editorship. For many years after his death, in 1855, "The Tablet" was a mere humdrum record of news. Among the distinguished editors was [[Cardinal Vaughan]] who conducted the "Tablet" during the stormy discussions on [[papal infallibility]] and the [[First Vatican Council]]. When he became [[Bishop of Salford]], he placed the editorship in the hands of [[Elliot Ranken]], who was succeeded by [[John George Snead-Cox]]. "The Tablet",  under the terms of the trust created by Cardinal Vaughan, had its profits go to the support of [[St. Joseph's Missionary College]], of which he was the founder.

Two other notable periodicals were founded in the forties. "The Tablet" was a sixpenny paper, reduced to five pence, on the abolition of the newspaper stamp duty. Its price put it beyond the reach of tens of thousands of Catholic workers. To supply them with a penny magazine Mr. Bradley in 1846 founded ''The Lamp''. It gave much of its space to Catholic fiction, descriptive articles, and the like, and ventured on an occasional illustration, a portrait or a picture of a new church; but it also supplied news and reported in full Wiseman's lectures and other notable Catholic utterances. For years it struggled with lack of capital, and for a while Bradley edited his paper from his room in the debtors' prison at York. His name deserves honourable record as the pioneer of the popular Catholic Press. The other paper, ''[[The Rambler (Catholic periodical)|The Rambler]]'', of which the first issue appeared on 1 January 1848, was intended to be a review of literature, art, and science. In 1859, [[Lord Acton]], who had then just returned from the Continent, succeeded Newman in the editorship. The price, sixpence, limited its public and in 1862 it became a quarterly under the title of "The Home and Foreign Review". In its last years this review was a source of trouble and disedification, and its sale, which dwindled yearly, was largely among Anglicans and other non-Catholics.

In the mid years of the nineteenth century the abolition of the various taxes on newspapers and the cheapening of the processes of production led to the coming of the penny newspapers. The first Catholic penny paper with permanent success was ''The London Universe''. Its origin was connected with the earlier activity of Lucas, who successfully advocated the introduction of the Conferences of St. Vincent de Paul into England. It was a group of members of the London Conferences who produced "The Universe". Speaking to their president [[George Blount (abbot)|George Blount]], one evening in 1860 Cardinal Wiseman after alluding to the attacks in the Press against the [[Holy See]] said: "Cannot the Society of St. Vincent de Paul do something to answer those frightful calumnies, by publishing truths, as M. [[Louis Veuillot]] is doing in Paris in 'L'Univers'? We want a penny paper, and now that the tax has been removed it should be possible." It was decided that, though the society, as such, could not found a newspaper, a committee of its members should undertake the task. It included George Blount, [[Stuart Knill (mayor)|Stuart Knill]] (afterwards the first Catholic Lord Mayor of London), Viscount Fielding ([[Lord Denbigh]]), Viscount Campden (the convert Sir [[Charles George Noel, 2nd Earl of Gainsborough]]), [[Sidney Lescher]], [[Archibald Dunn]], [[Arthur William à Beckett]], and [[George J. Wigley]], the London correspondent of the Paris ''Univers''. Wigley secured a foreign news service for the projected paper from Louis Veuillot's Paris office, and at his suggestion the name of ''The Universe'' was chosen. Denis Lane undertook the printing, Mr. Dunn the editorship, and on 8 December 1860, the first Catholic penny paper in England was started.

At first it was strictly non-political. The editor and staff gave their services gratuitously, but even with this help expenses were greater than receipts. To attract a larger circulation political articles were inserted, which led to the resignation of the greater part of the staff. Mr. Lane then took over the paper and conducted it for many years as a Catholic paper, giving a general support to the Liberals and the Irish national cause. He had always a priest as "theological editor"; amongst those who thus assisted him were Father W. Eyre, S.J., Father Lockhart, and Cardinal Manning. The movement for the rescue of destitute Catholic children originated in "The Universe" office. It amalgamated with another paper, ''The Catholic Weekly'', founded to give a record of Catholic news without any party politics, thus reverting to its original programme.

"The Lamp" was reorganized about the same time and had for some years a prosperous existence as a popular magazine. Fathers Rawes and Caswall, Lady [[Georgiana Fullerton]], [[Augusta Theodosia Drane]], [[Cecilia Caddell]] were among its contributors. In 1864 Miss Taylor founded ''[[The Month]]'', at first an illustrated magazine giving much of its space to fiction and the lighter forms of literature. When she founded her first community of nuns ([[Poor Servants of the Mother of God]]), her magazine passed to the [[Jesuit]]s, under the editorship of the Father [[Henry J. Coleridge]]. It had many notable contributors, and in its pages Newman's ''[[Dream of Gerontius]]'' first appeared.

Numerically, the main strength of English Catholicism has always been in the North, and after the foundation of "The Universe" several efforts were made to produce a Catholic penny paper in [[Lancashire]]. Three successive enterprises had a brief career. A fourth, a paper known as "The Northern Press" was barely existing, when, in 1867, it was taken over by Father [[James Nugent]] of [[Liverpool]]. He renamed it "The Catholic Times" and gradually made it the most widely circulated Catholic paper in England. Printed for many years by the boys of the refuge he had founded in Liverpool, when it became a profit-earning paper it helped support this work of charity. Offices were opened in Manchester and London. A special London edition was produced, and in 1878 a Christmas supplement issued under the title of "The Catholic Fireside" was so successful that it was continued as a monthly penny magazine; in 1893 it was made a weekly publication. "The Catholic Times" appealed largely to the Catholics of Irish descent in Great Britain, and championed the [[Irish Nationalist]] cause.  P. L. Beazley directed it for many years.

In the sixties other papers were founded, for a while fairly prosperous, though they never won the established position of "The Catholic Times" and "The Tablet". "The Weekly Register" was a threepenny paper, of much the same character as "The Tablet", but favouring the Liberals and Nationalists. Later, under the editorship of [[Charles Kent (English writer)|Charles Kent]] and then of [[Wilfrid Meynell]], it had a marked literary quality. "The Weekly Register" ceased to exist and with it "The Westminster Gazette", whose name is now that of a London evening paper. The "Westminster" was owned and edited by Pursell, afterwards biographer of Manning. During the months of newspaper controversy that preceded the definition of papal infallibility the "Westminster" was "non-opportunist", and Cardinal Vaughan, while he avoided all controversy on the subject in "The Tablet", contributed, week after week, letters to the "Westminster", combating its editorial views. It never had much circulation, and Vaughan was able a few years later to end its competition by buying and stopping it. Father Lockhart edited for some years "Catholic Opinion", a penny paper giving extracts from the Catholic press at home and abroad. After his death it was amalgamated with "The Catholic Times".

[[Charles Diamond]], for some time a member of the Irish Parliamentary party, started in 1884 "The Irish Tribune" in Newcastle upon Tyne. Shortly after, he purchased two other Catholic papers, the Glasgow "Observer" and the Preston "Catholic News", which were in difficulties for want of capital. He then formed the idea of working several papers from a common centre, much of the matter being common to all, but each appearing under a local title and having several columns of special matter of local interest. He  issued the ''[[Catholic Herald]]'' from London, as the centre of the organization, and thirty-two other local weekly papers in various towns of England, Wales, and Scotland. He also produced on the same system ten different parish magazines and "The Catholic Home Journal", with which the old "Lamp" was amalgamated.

There were a considerable number of minor Catholic monthlies, mostly founded in recent years to advocate and promote special objects. The "Annals of the Propagation of the Faith" and "illustrated Catholic Missions" specialize on the news of the mission field. "Catholic Book Notes", a monthly issued by the Catholic Truth Society and edited by [[James Britten]], was a record of current literature and reviews. "The Second Spring", edited by Father [[Philip Fletcher]], was a record of the work of the [[Ransom League]] for the conversion of England. "The Crucible" was a monthly review of [[social work]] for Catholic women.

Devotional magazines were issued by various religious orders, the most widely circulated of which was the "Messenger of the Sacred Heart", edited by the Jesuits. There were also several college magazines. In general circulations were quite low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11669b.htm |title=Periodical Literature, England |journal=Catholic Encyclopedia |year=1911 |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland under foreign partitions===
The Polish Catholic press reflected the political conditions of the empires that [[Partitions of Poland|had annexed the territory of Poland]]. In [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], part of [[Austria-Hungary]], it was considerably freer; in [[Imperial Russia]] and in the [[German Empire]] there was severe [[censorship]] of all Polish language periodicals. Greater development took place from 1831 to 1864 in the period of national [[November Uprising|insurrections against the occupying powers]].

One of the oldest Polish publications in the [[Austrian Partition]] was the ''Czas'' (Time) daily, the organ of the Conservative party. Its publication began in 1848. In 1866 there appeared the ''Przegląd polski'' (Polish Review), which had from its beginning the collaboration of Count [[Stanisław Tarnowski]] and [[Stanisław Egbert Koźmian]]. The ''Czas'' and the ''Przegląd polski'' always maintained a strictly Catholic character. In 1867 [[Juliusz Starkla]] and [[Tadeusz Romanowicz]] established at [[Lemberg]] (Lwów) the ''Dziennik Literacki'' (Literary Journal), which had a short life; [[Jan Dobrzański]] founded the "Gazeta Narodowa" (National Gazette), to which was united in 1869 the ''Dziennik Polski'' (Polish Journal). In 1871 Rev. [[Edward Podolski]] established the ''Przegląd lwowski'' (Lemberg Review), which strenuously defended Catholic interests. In the same city there appeared the ''Gazeta Lwowska'' (Lemberg Gazette), the organ of the imperial viceroy in Galicia.&lt;ref name="newadvent-Poland"/&gt;

In 1884 the Polish Jesuits began at [[Kraków]] (Cracow) the publication of the ''Przegląd powszechny'' (Universal Review), covering scientific and literary points of view. In the same city from 1881 to 1886 there was published the ''Przegląd literacki i artystyczny'' (Literary and Artistic Review). In 1894 in the whole of Austria-Hungary there were 126 Polish periodicals and daily papers, of which 65 appeared at Lemberg (Lwów, in Polish) and 29 at Kraków. At Lemberg the daily papers were the ''Dziennik polski'', the ''Gazeta lwowska'', the ''Gazeta narodowa'', the ''Kurjer Lwowski'', and the ''Przegląd''. There were two Catholic weeklies, the ''Gazeta katolicka'' and the ''Tygodnik katolicki''.&lt;ref name="newadvent-Poland"/&gt;

The ''Gazeta kościelna'' (Ecclesiastical Gazette), representative of the Catholic press, was a small semi-weekly, poor in doctrine and immersed in politics. From the scientific standpoint the most important periodical was the ''Kwaltarnik hystoryczny'' (Tri-monthly historical periodical), which began publication in 1886. Also important were the ''Pamiętniki literackie'' (Literary Memoirs), the ''Ateneum polskie'', the ''Kosmos'' (the organ of the society of naturalists of Lemberg), and the ''Nasz kraj''.&lt;ref name="newadvent-Poland"/&gt;

At Kraków, besides the ''Czas'', there were the ''Nowa Reforma'' and the ''Głos narodu'' (Voice of the People), an organ of the clergy and of the militant Catholic party. The Socialists published there the ''Naprzód'' (Forward), the official organ of their party, and the monthly periodical ''Krytyka''. In following years there has been established the ''Świat Słowiański'' (Slavic World), the organ of the Slav club of Kraków, containing valuable information relating to the various Slavic countries. The Academy of Sciences of Kraków published a ''Bulletin international'', monthly; and the ''Rozprawy'' (Dissertations) of mathematics, physics, and biology. Daily papers and periodicals were published also in the other Galician cities of [[Tarnów]], [[Rzeszów]], [[Sambir|Sambor]], [[Stanyslaviv|Stanisławów]], [[Jarosław]], and [[Przemyśl]].&lt;ref name="newadvent-Poland"/&gt;

One of the oldest Polish daily papers in Prussia was the ''Dziennik poznański'' (Posen Journal), established in 1859. From 1845 to 1865 there appeared the ''Przegląd poznański'', an ardent defender of Catholicism, edited by Rev. [[Jan Koźmian]]; in 1860 Rev. Jan Prusinowski published the ''Tygodnik katolicki'' (illustrated weekly). In 1865 [[Ludwik Rzepecki]] began the publication of the scientific periodical ''Oświata'' (Culture), which, however, had only a short life, and was followed by the ''Przegląd Wielkopolski'' (Review of Greater Poland), edited by [[Emil Kierski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.worldcat.org/title/przeglad-wielkopolski-historyczny-i-literacki/oclc/749265437&amp;referer=brief_results |title=Przegląd Wielkopolski, Historyczny i Literacki (Journal, magazine, 1867) |work=worldcat.org |year=2015 |accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870 [[Edmond Callier]] founded the ''Tygodnik Wielkopolski'', to which leading Polish writers contributed. The ''Kurjer Poznański'', established by [[Teodor Żychliński]] in 1872, also acquired great importance. In 1894 there were published in Prussia and in the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] the following daily papers: the ''Dziennik poznański'', the ''Goniec wielkopolski'', the ''Kurjer poznański'', the nationalist ''Orędownik'' (Advocate),{{Ref|a|[a]}} and the ''Wielkopolanin''. The ''Przegląd poznański'' resumed its publications under the direction of [[Władysław Rabski]], while other daily papers were published at Danzig ([[Gdańsk]]), Thorn ([[Toruń]]), [[Pelplin]], and Allenstein ([[Olsztyn]]).&lt;ref name="newadvent-Poland"/&gt;

In 1841 the publication of the ''Biblioteka Warszawska'', a monthly periodical dedicated especially to literature, began in [[Russian Poland]]. There were published in [[Warsaw]] the ''Dzień'' (Day); the ''Dziennik powszechny'' (Universal Journal); the ''Głos Warszawski'' (Voice of Warsaw); ''Głos poranny'' (Voice of Morning); the ''Kurjer polski''; ''Kurjer Warszawski''; ''Nowa Gazeta''; ''Przegląd poranny''; ''Wiadomości Codzienne'' (Daily News); ''Słowo'' (Word), a nationalist paper that had great influence; and the ''Warszawska Gazeta''. Other dailies were published at [[Lublin]], [[Kiev]] (''Dziennik kijowski''), at [[Vilna]] (''Kurjer litewski'' and ''Goniec Wilenski'') at [[Łódź]] and at [[St. Petersburg]]. Among the periodicals, besides the ''Biblioteka Warszawska'', were the ''Biesiada literacka'' (Literary Banquet), splendidly illustrated; the ''Kultura'', hostile to religiocity; the ''Przegląd filozoficzny'' (Philosophical Review), a quarterly publication; the ''Przegląd historyczny'' (Historical Review), scientific, twice monthly; the ''Świat'' (World), an illustrated weekly; and the ''Tygodnik illustrowany''. The Catholic press was represented by the ''Przegląd katolicki'', of Warsaw, a publication dedicated to politics. This paper was the one most read by the clergy. Count [[Roger Łubieński]] (''hrabia'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Z_Ameryki.html?id=ZsB38ly1434C&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Z Ameryki |publisher=Gebethner i Wolff |year=1900 |accessdate=28 January 2014 |author=Roger Łubieński (hrabia.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; established the ''Wiara'' (Faith), a weekly devoted to ecclesiastical news; and these two publications were later united into one. A scientifically important periodical, the ''Kwartalnik teologiczny'', lasted only a few years. By the early twentieth century, of the daily papers or periodicals for the clergy, or having a strictly Catholic programme, those most read were: the ''Polak katolik''; the ''Myśl katolicka'', of [[Częstochowa]]; and the ''Atheneum kapłańskie'', of the seminary of [[Włocławek]], a monthly scientific publication.&lt;ref name="newadvent-Poland"/&gt;

In 1864 Polish exiles established the ''Ojczyna'' (Native Land) at [[Leipzig]], the ''Przyszłość'' (The Future) at Paris, and the "Przeglad powszechny" at [[Dresden]]. At [[Chicago]], U.S.A., the chief centre of Polish emigration, were published the ''Dziennik chicagoski'', the ''Dzien swiety'' (Holy Day), the ''Gazeta katolicka'', the ''Gazeta polska'', the ''Nowe Zycie'' (New Life), the ''Sztandar'', ''Tygodnik naukowo-powiesciowy'', ''Wiara i ojczyna'', ''Zgoda'', and ''Ziarno'', a musical publication. Other papers were published at [[Milwaukee]], [[Buffalo, N.Y.]], [[New York City]], [[Detroit]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Winona, Minnesota|Winona]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Baltimore]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Stevens Point]], [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]], [[Mahanoy City]], and [[Wilkes-Barre]]. Brazil also had a Polish publication.&lt;ref name="newadvent-Poland"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11687a.htm |title=Periodical Literature, Poland |journal=Catholic Encyclopedia |year=1911 |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ARKive''' is a global initiative with the mission of "promoting the conservation of the world's threatened species, through the power of wildlife imagery",&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/about/|title=About ARKive|work=ARKive|accessdate=12 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110701182614/http://www.arkive.org/about/| archivedate= 1 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/about/|title=About Arkive|work=Arkive|publisher=Wildscreen|accessdate=25 July 2017| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170713182635/http://www.arkive.org/about/| archivedate= 13 July 2017| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it does by locating and gathering films, photographs and audio recordings of the world's [[species]] into a centralised [[Digital data|digital]] [[archive]].&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; Its current priority is the completion of audio-visual profiles for the c. 17,000 species on the [[IUCN Red List]] of Threatened Species.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

The project is an initiative of [[Wildscreen]], a UK-registered educational charity,&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|299450|Wildscreen}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref name="Wildscreen-About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildscreen.org.uk/about|title=Wildscreen - About|accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technical platform was created by [[Hewlett Packard]], as part of the HP Labs' Digital Media Systems research programme.&lt;ref name="HP1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/ssrc/services/publishing/arkive/ |title=HP Labs : Solutions and Services Research : Technology for Services : Services for Digital Publishing : ARKive |work=[[Hewlett-Packard]] |accessdate=12 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120025341/http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/ssrc/services/publishing/arkive/ |archivedate=20 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARKive has the backing of leading conservation organisations, including [[BirdLife International]], [[Conservation International]], [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), The [[United Nations]]' [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]] (UNEP-WCMC), and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF),&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; as well as leading academic and research institutions, such as the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]; [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]; and the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; It is a member of the Institutional Council of the [[Encyclopedia of Life]].&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

Two ARKive layers for [[Google Earth]], featuring endangered species&lt;ref name="GEOutreach"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth.google.com/outreach/showcase.html|title=Google Earth Outreach|work=[[Google Search]]|accessdate=12 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716075715/http://earth.google.com/outreach/showcase.html| archivedate= 16 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and species in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]&lt;ref name="GEOutreach" /&gt; have been produced by [[Google Earth Outreach]]. The first of these was launched in April 2008 by Wildscreen's Patron, Sir [[David Attenborough]].&lt;ref name="GEO-launch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/news/press-release-20080410-launch-of-arkive-google-earth-layer.html |title=Attenborough launches Wildscreen's Google Earth Layer - Press release 10 Apr 08 - ARKive |date=2008-04-10 |publisher=[[Wildscreen]] |accessdate=12 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317000607/http://www.arkive.org/news/press-release-20080410-launch-of-arkive-google-earth-layer.html |archivedate=17 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:David Attenborough.jpg|thumb|260px|left|[[Sir David Attenborough]] and the ARKive]]
The project formally was launched on 20 May 2003&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://living.scotsman.com/features/The-animals-came-in-bit.2428238.jp |title=The animals came in bit by byte |author=Gilchrist, Jim |publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]'' |date=2003-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/3041813.stm |title=Digital Noah's Ark launched |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2003-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arkive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkive.org/about/wildscreen.html |title=About ARKive: Wildscreen |publisher=ARKive.org |accessdate=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARKive-2011-2015"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ARKive 2011-2015 (brochure)|publisher=ARKive}}&lt;/ref&gt; by its patron, the [[UK]]-based natural history presenter, [[David Attenborough|Sir David Attenborough]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/conservation/story/0,,969572,00.html|publisher=''The Guardian''|title=Arkive sets sail on the web|accessdate=2 July 2007 | location=London | first=Ashley | last=Davies | date=2003-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2002-12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org.uk/|title=December 2002 version|publisher=[[Wildscreen]]|accessdate=12 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021201024509/http://www.arkive.org.uk/|archivedate=2002-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; a long-standing colleague and friend of its chief instigator, the late [[Christopher Parsons]], a former Head of the [[BBC Natural History Unit]]. Parsons never lived to see the fruition of the project, succumbing to cancer in November 2002 at the age of 70.&lt;ref name="obit1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/nov/14/bbc.guardianobituaries |title=Obituary: Christopher Parsons |author=Paine, Barry |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=2002-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons identified a need to provide a centralised safe haven for wildlife films and photographs after discovering that many such records are held in scattered, non-indexed, collections, often with little or no public access, and sometimes in conditions that could lead to loss or damage.&lt;ref name="obit1" /&gt; He believed the records could be a powerful force in building environmental awareness by bringing [[Biological classification|scientific names]] to life. He also saw their [[film preservation|preservation]] as an important educational resource and conservation tool, not least because extinction rates and habitat destruction could mean that images and sounds might be the only legacy of some species’ existence.

His vision of a permanent, accessible, refuge for audio-visual wildlife material won almost immediate support from many of the world’s major broadcasters, including the [[BBC]],&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt; [[Granada Television|Granada]],&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt; international state broadcasting corporations&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt; and [[National Geographic (magazine)|''National Geographic'' magazine]];&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt; leading film and photographic libraries, international conservation organisations and academic institutes such as [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name="scotsman" /&gt;

The initial feasibility study for creating ARKive was carried out in the late 1980s by conservationist [[John Burton (conservationist)|John Burton]],&lt;ref name="WLT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlandtrust.org/about/biographies.htm|title=About the World Land Trust: Staff Biographies|publisher=[[World Land Trust]]|accessdate=12 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913074515/http://www.worldlandtrust.org/about/biographies.htm|archive-date=13 September 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but at the time the costs of the technology needed were too far too high,&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HP+Helps+The+Wildscreen+Trust+Create+ARKive%3A+ARKive+Provides+Digital...-a0102007545 |title=HP Helps The Wildscreen Trust Create ARKive: ARKive Provides Digital Safe Haven for Records of Endangered Species |publisher=Business Wire |date=2003-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so it was over a decade later, after the technology had caught up with Christopher Parson's vision (and the costs dropped), that the project was able to get off the ground.

'''''Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark''''' (or ''Acquainted with the Night: A Celebration of the Dark Hours'') is a non-fiction book by [[Christopher Dewdney]] about various aspects of [[night]]. It was first published in 2004 by [[HarperCollins]]. It uses the same title as the [[Robert Frost]] poem "[[Acquainted with the Night]]". The book consists of 14 chapters, with one chapter dedicated to each hour of the night, from 6 pm to 5 am. Mini-essays populate each chapter which each follow a theme, like nocturnal creatures, dreams, astronomy, and mythology. Other subjects and topics touched upon include science, art, culture, natural history, superstitions, and psychology. The book was a finalist for the [[2004 Governor General's Awards]] and for the 2005 [[Charles Taylor Prize]]. It tied with ''Dark Matter: Reading The Bones'' for the [[World Fantasy Award]] in Anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=World Fantasy Convention |year=2010 |title=Award Winners and Nominees |url=http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html/ |accessdate=Feb 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201074405/http://worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html |archivedate=December 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
At the time of ''Acquainted with the Night'''s writing, author and poet Christopher Dewdney was 52 years old and living in Toronto with his wife, [[Barbara Gowdy]]. He had previously written 14 books, the last being the 2002 book of poetry, ''The Natural History''. His previous non-fiction books were ''Last Flesh: Life in the Transhuman Era'' (1998) on the impacts of technological advances on humanism, ''The Secular Grail: Paradigms of Perception'' (1993) regarding the human psyche, and ''The Immaculate Perception'' (1986) on his views of consciousness, language and dreams. Dewdney's past books were described as being "more admired than read".&lt;ref name=Wake/&gt; On the topic of 'the night', he had a lifelong fascination with nightlife and eventually decided to write a book about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Dewdney |first = Christopher |authorlink= Christopher Dewdney |title= Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark |publisher= [[HarperCollins]] |year = 2004 |isbn= 0-00-200639-1 |pages = 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly became overwhelmed by the amount of information relating to the subject. For research, he consulted a variety of genres and formats, including books, journals, magazines, music, and movies, and collected information within the broad topics of art, science, social sciences and history. The perspective Dewdney took was that of "explaining night to beings from another planet that had two opposed suns and no night at all".&lt;ref&gt;Dewdney, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The content is divided into 14 chapters. The first chapter serves as an introduction and considers the mythological and geological origin of night. The next 12 chapters are each titled after an hour starting with chapter 2's 6 pm and ending with chapter 13's 5 am. Chapter 2 discusses the transition into night, including [[sunset]]s, the [[green flash]], the stages of [[twilight]], as well as [[Olbers' paradox]], and a definition of the size and speed of night. The 7 pm chapter deals with nature at night, how animals see and hear differently at night with a focus on [[bat]]s, [[nighthawk]]s, and nocturnal insects. The 8 pm chapter analyzes children's literature and bedtime stories. The 9 pm chapter discusses aspects of the city at night, including the evolution of [[nightclub]]s, [[street light]]s, and the impacts of [[light pollution]]. The 10 pm chapter discusses night festivals around the world and throughout history. The 11 pm chapter explains the [[circadian rhythm]] and the physiology of sleep and dreams.

{{Quote_box|width=40%|align=left|quote=&lt;div style="text-align:left;"&gt;The attacks would almost always strike during the REM phase of the victim's first sleep cycle of the night... [One patient] who had survived several attacks said that, during each attack, something came into his bedroom, sat on his chest, and tried to crush the air out of his lungs. In one nightmare it was a cat, in another a dog, and once it was a woman.&lt;/div&gt;
|source=Dewdney on [[sudden unexplained death syndrome]], ''Acquainted with the Night'', pages 177&amp;ndash;178.}}

The 12 am chapter traces the history behind dream interpretation from [[Epic of Gilgamesh|Gilgamesh]] to [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]], and Calvin Hall. Here, Dewdney considers nightmares and takes [[sudden unexplained death syndrome]], whose sufferers are almost always Asian males, between 20 and 49 years old, as an extreme example of nightmares that cause the dreamer to die from a "[[ventricular fibrillation]]...brought about by extreme terror".&lt;ref&gt;Dewdney, 178.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1 am chapter compares literary and mythological personifications of, or beings associated with, the night. The 2 am chapter tells the stories of the legends behind the [[moon]] and the constellations. The 3 am chapter is all about [[insomnia]]. The 4 am chapter provides a geographical aspect, touring the places with long nights, like [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[cave]]s, the [[Polar night|poles]], and deep within the oceans. The 5 am chapter discusses artistic representations of night, especially in music, on film and through paintings. The final chapter is a conclusion in which Dewdney reflects on memorable sunrises he has experienced and contrasts sunrises with sunsets.

==Style==
The title shares its name with the [[Robert Frost]] poem [[Acquainted with the Night]], which is quoted on the first page.&lt;ref&gt;Dewdney, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The book's structure uses twelve chapters, equating to twelve hours of night, from 6 pm to 5 am. Two additional chapters, "First Night" and "Night's Last Stand", bookend the twelve chapters as an introduction and conclusion. This hour-by-hour structure was used to move the narrative along logically while jumping between diverse topics.&lt;ref name=Wigod&gt;{{cite news |last= Wigod |first=Rebecca |title= Night falls, and things happen |newspaper= [[The Vancouver Sun]] |date=June 5, 2004 |page=D13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topics range from such disparate subjects as culture, superstitions, natural history, physiology, and psychology so that reviewers variously called the book "a compendium",&lt;ref name=Jamieson/&gt; "a browser's book"&lt;ref name=Atwood/&gt; and full of "encyclopedic mini-essays".&lt;ref name=Birkerts/&gt; Autobiographical passages are also included.&lt;ref name=Gargan/&gt; One reviewer noted the format uses personal observations that lead to discussions of broad subjects with "side trips into relevant supporting materials".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Meriwether |first= Doris |date=November 2004 |title= Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark |journal= [[Magill Book Reviews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reviewer for the ''[[Quill &amp; Quire]]'' cited the book as an example of a subgenre which an article in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' dubbed "mundane studies" referring to the ubiquity of the subject, like [[Mark Kurlansky]]'s ''[[Salt: A World History]]'' and [[Witold Rybczynski]]'s ''[[One Good Turn (book)|One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw]]''.&lt;ref name=Dinka/&gt; Dewdney's writing in ''Acquainted with the Night'' combines a poet's point of view with an interest for the sciences.&lt;ref name=Wake/&gt; The tone was described as "boyish enthusiasm"&lt;ref name=Atwood/&gt; and "highly condensed yet personable voice".&lt;ref name=Pubweekly/&gt;  Gisèle Baxter, in the journal ''Canadian Literature'', wrote that the its tone was set at the beginning of the book by "an anecdote of a small boy creeping into the moonlit, partly wooded backyard of his family home".&lt;ref name=Baxter&gt;{{cite journal |last= Baxter |first= Gisèle |date=Winter 2006 |title= Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark |journal= [[Canadian Literature (journal)|Canadian Literature]] |issue= 191 |pages= 189–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication and reception==
''Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark'' was published as a hardback in Canada by [[HarperCollins]] in May 2004. In the United States, [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] published the hardback version in July 2004 as ''Acquainted with the Night: A Celebration of the Dark Hours''. &lt;!--No evidence of it appearing on any bestseller lists---&gt; The trade paperback version was published by HarperCollins in March 2005. An excerpt was published in the Canadian literary magazine ''[[Geist (magazine)|Geist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Dewdney |first= Christopher |date=Spring 2004 |title= Acquainted with the Night |journal= [[Geist (magazine)|Geist]] |issue=52 |pages= 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was nominated for the 2005 [[Charles Taylor Prize]], awarded to the best Canadian work of literary non-fiction, and Dewdney was a finalist in the [[Governor General's Award for English language non-fiction|English-language non-fiction category]] of the [[2004 Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Awards]]. The ''[[Library Journal]]'' noted the book would be "most useful for larger public libraries".&lt;ref name=Gargan&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gargan |first= William |date=June 2004 |title= Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark |journal= [[Library Journal]] |volume= 129 |issue=10 |page= 133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Dewdney's writing, the reviewer for ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote that Dewdney writes carefully and "confidently".&lt;ref name=Pubweekly&gt;{{cite journal |date= April 26, 2004 |title= Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark |journal= [[Publishers Weekly]] |volume= 251 |issue=17 |page= 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer called the book "engaging and recreational".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=April 2004 |title= Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark |journal= [[Kirkus Reviews]] |volume= 72 |issue=7 |page= 308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gisèle Baxter, in ''Canadian Literature'', found his use of language "provok[es] consideration through its elegant turns of phrase and image"&lt;ref name=Baxter/&gt; and Laura Wright, in ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' called the imagery "arresting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Wright |first= Laura |date=August 2004 |title= Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark |journal= [[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |volume= 25 |issue=8 |page= 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', poet and novelist [[Margaret Atwood]] wrote, "The prose moves from the strictly informative to the lyrical to the charming to the amusing to the odd to the strangely moving without batting an eye."&lt;ref name=Atwood&gt;{{cite news |last= Atwood |first=Margaret |title= Mesmerized by the night |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |date=May 22, 2004 |page=D7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer noted Dewdney "combined a deft lyric touch with a deep interest in science".&lt;ref name=Wake&gt;{{cite news |last= Wake |first=Hal |title= Acquainted With the Night |newspaper= [[The Georgia Straight]] |agency= Vancouver Free Press |date=June 17, 2004 |url= https://www.straight.com/node/2393/print |accessdate=November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer for ''[[Canadian Geographic]]'' wrote that "the strength of the book is in its artful mix of science and poetry".&lt;ref name=Jamieson&gt;{{cite journal |last= Findlay |first= Jamieson |date=July–August 2004 |title= An enlightening romp through darkness |journal= [[Canadian Geographic]] |volume= 124 |issue=4 |page= 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literary critic [[Sven Birkerts]] found Dewdney to be "an engaging enough narrator and solid, enthusiastic stylist".&lt;ref name=Birkerts&gt;{{cite news |last= Birkerts |first=Sven |authorlink= Sven Birkerts |title= Heart of darkness |newspaper= [[The Boston Globe]] |date=August 8, 2004 |url= http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2004/08/08/heart_of_darkness/ |accessdate=November 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's structure received mixed reviews, some reviewers found Dewdney was able to effectively transition between various topics while other reviewers did not. Birkerts wrote the book has "a fun-facts-fished-from-the-data-ocean...[and] end-of-term crammer" sense to it.&lt;ref name=Birkerts/&gt; The ''[[Quill &amp; Quire]]'' and ''[[The Economist]]'' reviewers found the topics were too cursory, like "an encyclopedia entry".&lt;ref name=Dinka&gt;{{cite journal |last= Dinka |first= Nicholas |date=July 2004 |title= Night moves |journal= [[Quill &amp; Quire]] |volume= 70 |issue=7 |page= 36 |url= http://www.quillandquire.com/reviews/review.cfm?review_id=4013 |accessdate=November 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date = June 14, 2004 |title= Dark thoughts |journal= [[The Economist]] |volume= 372 |issue=8388 |page= 76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birkerts concluded "that any one of Dewdney's excursions could earn its keep as a column in a popular science magazine" but assembled into one book the topics seemed random.&lt;ref name=Birkerts/&gt;

{{Italic title}}
An '''''amicus curiae''''' (literally, "'''friend of the court'''"; plural, '''''amici curiae''''') is someone who is not a [[Party (law)|party]] to a case and may or may not have been solicited by a party and who assists a [[court]] by offering information, expertise, or insight that has a bearing on the issues in the case; and is typically presented in the form of a [[Brief_(law)|brief]]. The decision on whether to consider an amicus brief lies within the discretion of the court. The phrase ''amicus curiae'' is [[legal Latin]]. 

== History ==
The ''amicus curiae'' figure originates in [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Participation As Amicus Curiae Before the U.S. Supreme Court |author=Judithanne Scourfield McLauchlan |publisher=LFB Scholarly Publishing |page=266 |isbn=1-59332-088-4 |year=2005 |url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/mclauchlan1005.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517005634/http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/mclauchlan1005.htm |archivedate=17 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 9th century,{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} it was incorporated into [[English law]], and it was later extended to most [[common law]] systems. Later, it was introduced in [[international law]], in particular concerning [[human rights]]. From there, it was integrated in some [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems (it has recently{{when|date=February 2017}} been integrated into [[Argentina]]'s law system and [[Honduras]]'s 2010 civil procedures code). Today, it is used by the [[European Court of Human Rights]], the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]], the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], the Court of Justice of the European Union and the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]].

== Presentation ==

The role of an ''amicus'' is often confused with that of an [[Intervention (law)|intervener]]. The role of an ''amicus'' is, as stated by Salmon [[Judicial titles in England and Wales#Court of Appeal|LJ]] (as [[Cyril Salmon, Baron Salmon|Lord Salmon]] then was) in ''Allen v Sir Alfred McAlpine &amp; Sons Ltd'' [1968] 2 QB 229 at p.&amp;nbsp;266 F-G:

{{quote|I had always understood that the role of an ''amicus curiae'' was to help the court by expounding the law impartially, or if one of the parties were unrepresented, by advancing the legal arguments on his behalf.}}

The situation most often noted in the press is when an [[interest group|advocacy group]] files a brief in a case before an [[appellate court]] in which it is not a [[litigant]].  Appellate cases are normally limited to the factual record and arguments coming from the [[lower court]] case under appeal; attorneys focus on the facts and arguments most favorable to their clients.  Where a case may have broader implications, ''amicus curiae'' briefs are a way to articulate those concerns, so that the possibly broad legal or public policy ramifications of the court's anticipated decisions will not depend solely on the positions and arguments advanced by the parties directly involved in the case.

In prominent cases, ''amici curiae'' are generally organizations with sizable legal budgets. In the United States, for example, non-profit legal advocacy organizations, such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [[Landmark Legal Foundation]], the [[Pacific Legal Foundation]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], the [[American Center for Law and Justice]] or [[NORML]], frequently submit such briefs to advocate for or against a particular legal change or interpretation. If a decision could affect an entire industry, companies other than the litigants may wish to have their concerns heard.  In the [[United States]], [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] often hear cases involving the [[constitutionality]] of state laws.  Hence states may file briefs as ''amici curiae'' when their laws or interests are likely to be affected, as in the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case ''[[McDonald v. Chicago]],'' when thirty-two states under the aegis of Texas (and California independently) filed such briefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagoguncase.com/2009/07/07/thirty-four-states-support-second-amendment-incorporation/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721221517/http://www.chicagoguncase.com/2009/07/07/thirty-four-states-support-second-amendment-incorporation/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 July 2012 |title=Thirty-four states support second amendment incorporation |first=Alan |last=Gura |work=ChicagoGunCase |date=7 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Amici curiae'' who do not file briefs often present an academic perspective on the case.  For example, if the law gives deference to a history of legislation of a certain topic, a historian may choose to evaluate the claim from specialized expertise.  An economist, statistician, or sociologist may choose to do the same. Newspaper editorials, [[blog]]s, and other opinion pieces arguably have the capability to influence Supreme Court decisions as ''de facto amici curiae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://lawreview.stanford.edu/content/vol61/issue6/RLee.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521043107/http://lawreview.stanford.edu/content/vol61/issue6/RLee.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-21 |title=Ex Parte Blogging: The Legal Ethics of Supreme Court Advocacy in the Internet Era |first=Rachel C. |last=Lee |journal=Stanford Law Review |volume=61 |issue=6 |date=April 2009 |pages=1535–1571}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://yro.slashdot.org/story/09/05/08/135200/bloggers-impacting-the-world-of-litigation |title=Bloggers Impacting the World of Litigation |date=8 May 2009 |first=Keith |last=Dawson |work=[[Slashdot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not, however, technically considered ''amicus curiae,'' as they do not submit materials to the Court, do not need to ask for leave, and have no guarantee that they will be read.

==United States Supreme Court rules==
The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has special rules for ''amicus curiae'' briefs sought to be filed in cases pending before it. Supreme Court Rule 37 states, in part, such a brief should cover "relevant matter" not dealt with by the parties which "may be of considerable help".&lt;ref&gt;Rule 37(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of an ''amicus'' brief must identify which party the brief is supporting, or if the brief supports only affirmance or reversal.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court Rule 37.3(a)&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also requires that, ''inter alia'', all non-governmental amici identify those providing a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of the brief.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court Rule 37.6&lt;/ref&gt; Briefs must be prepared in booklet format, and 40 copies must be served with the Court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/ctrules/2010RulesoftheCourt.pdf United States Supreme Court Rule], 33&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States Supreme Court, unless the ''amicus'' brief is being filed by the federal government (or one of its officers or agents) or a U.S. state, permission of the court (by means of [[motion for leave]]) or mutual consent of the parties is  generally required. Allowing an ''amicus curiae'' to present oral argument is considered "extraordinary".&lt;ref&gt;FRAP 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The court can also appoint its own ''amicus curiae'' if neither party supports the decision of the lower court, which it has done at least 43 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldman|first1=Brian P.|title=Should the Supreme Court Stop Inviting Amici Curiae to Defend Abandoned Lower Court Decisions?|journal=Stanford Law Review|date=2011|volume=63|pages=907-972|url=http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2011/04/Goldman-63_Stan._L._Rev._907.pdf|accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the World Trade Organization ==
The role of ''amicus curiae'' briefs in the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) dispute settlement system is controversial. The controversy arises due to the governmental nature of WTO disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van den Bossche|first1=Peter|title=The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=263|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; As only WTO members have access to the system, any non-members such as [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) are excluded and have no right to be heard.&lt;ref name="Van den Bossche"&gt;Van den Bossche, 2013, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the only way for them to contribute to a WTO decision is through ''amicus curiae'' briefs. To date{{When|date=December 2015}} there is a divergence in approaches in the WTO as to the admissibility of such briefs.&lt;ref name="Van den Bossche" /&gt;

=== Panel and Appellate Body reports ===
The first WTO case to comprehensively examine the admissibility of ''amicus curiae'' briefs was US – Shrimp.&lt;ref&gt;Panel Report, United States – Import Prohibition on Certain Shrimp and Shrimp Products, WT/DS58/R/Corr.1 (3 November 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The case concerned a ban by the US on imports of all shrimp and shrimp products not caught with turtle excluder devices. The panel at first instance rejected the two ''amicus curiae'' briefs that were submitted by environmental groups, on the basis they were not expressly solicited by the panel under Article 13 of the [[Dispute Settlement Understanding]] of the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;Panel Report, United States – Import Prohibition on Certain Shrimp and Shrimp Products, WT/DS58/R/Corr.1 (3 November 1998), [7.8]&lt;/ref&gt; This was overturned by the [[Appellate Body]] who held a panel had authority to accept, consider or reject briefs under Articles 12 and 13 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding regardless of whether they were expressly solicited.&lt;ref&gt;Appellate Body Report, United States – Import Prohibition on Certain Shrimp and Shrimp Products, WTO Doc WT/DS58/AB/R12, AB-1994-4 (12 October 1998), [89]&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue was re-examined in US – Lead and Bismuth II which concerned the imposition of duties by the US on certain imported hot rolled lead and bismuth carbon steel from the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Panel Report, United States – Imposition of Countervailing Duties on Certain Hot-rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products Originating in the United Kingdom, WTO Doc WT/DS138/R (23 December 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The Panel at first instance affirmed the position in the US – Shrimp case and accepted two ''amicus curiae'' briefs that were submitted.&lt;ref&gt;Panel Report, United States – Imposition of Countervailing Duties on Certain Hot-rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products Originating in the United Kingdom, WTO Doc WT/DS138/R (23 December 1999), [24]&lt;/ref&gt; On appeal, the Appellate Body relied on Article 17.9 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding and Rule 16(1) of the Working Procedures for Appellate Review to create rules to accept ''amicus curiae'' briefs.&lt;ref name="Appellate Body Report 2000"&gt;Appellate Body Report, United States – Imposition of Countervailing Duties on Certain Hot-rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products Originating in the United Kingdom, WTO Doc WT/DS138/AB/R, AB-2000-1 (10 May 2000), [39]-[42]&lt;/ref&gt; This was deemed as the source of legal authority to accept such briefs by an Appellate Body.&lt;ref name="Appellate Body Report 2000"/&gt;

The next significant case to deal with ''amicus curiae'' briefs was EC – Asbestos, where the French government banned domestically produced and imported [[asbestos]] products.&lt;ref&gt;Panel Report, European Community – Measures Affecting Asbestos and Products Containing Asbestos, WTO Doc WT/DS135/R (18 September 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Of the five ''amicus curiae'' briefs received by the Panel, only two that were submitted by the European Community, were accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Panel Report, European Community – Measures Affecting Asbestos and Products Containing Asbestos, WTO Doc WT/DS135/R (18 September 2000), [8.12].&lt;/ref&gt; The panel did not provide any explanation as to why they were accepted or rejected. On appeal, the Appellate Body relied on Rule 16(1) of the ''Working Procedures for Appellate Review'' to create additional procedures to deal with the ''amicus curiae'' briefs.&lt;ref name="Appellate Body Report 2001"&gt;Appellate Body Report, European Community – Measures Affecting Asbestos and Products Containing Asbestos, WTO Doc WT/DS135/AB/R, AB-2000-11 (12 March 2001), [50]-[51].&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 11 briefs submitted, the Appellate Body accepted none on the basis they failed to comply with these additional procedures.&lt;ref name="Appellate Body Report 2001"/&gt;

'''''Chambers Biographical Dictionary''''' provides concise descriptions of over 18,000 notable figures from Britain and the rest of the world. It was first published in 1897.

The centenary edition ({{ISBN|0-550-16060-4}}) was edited by [[Melanie Parry]] and the revised edition ({{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}) was edited by J. O. Thorne and T. C. Collocott.&lt;ref name="CBD"&gt;''Chambers Biographical Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; The 9th edition, 2011, has biographies of over 18,000 people, most consisting of about a dozen lines in a two-column page layout. Some however run to 50 lines or more while [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] covers two pages. Entries typically consist of place of birth, a summary on education or career, and achievements or publications. A single reference source is usually given.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/reference/chambers.htm M. A. Orthofer, "Chambers Biographical Dictionary"], ''The Complete Review''. Retrieved 25 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The publishers, [[Chambers Harrap]], who were formerly based in [[Edinburgh]], claim their ''Biographical Dictionary'' is the most comprehensive and authoritative single-volume biographical dictionary available, covering entries in such areas as sport, science, music, art, literature, politics, television, and film. The 1990 reprint is published by University Press, [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="CBD" /&gt;

The centenary edition contained well over 17,500 alphabetically arranged articles describing the nationality, occupation, and achievements of each person, as well as 250 panels which focus on a wide variety of individuals regarded as being particularly important, influential, and interesting. Sources are given and there are thousands of suggestions for further reading.

The '''''Chronica Adefonsi Imperatoris''''', meaning "Chronicle of Alfonso the Emperor", was a [[chronicle]] of the reign of [[Alfonso VII of León]], [[Imperator totius Hispaniae|Emperor of Spain]], lasting from 1126 to 1157. The author is anonymous, but he covers far more than just the imperial court. 

The ''Chronica'' is not hagiographical of the emperor, but is supportive of his imperial policies and takes the concept of an ''[[Imperator totius Hispaniae|imperium Hispaniae]]'' most seriously. The interrelations of the various peninsular kingdoms are laboured extensively, as are Alfonso's pretensions. The ''Chronica'' provides the best source of information on twelfth-century Castile-León.

The '''Deed of Gift of the America's Cup''' is the primary instrument that governs the rules to make a valid challenge for the [[America's Cup]] and the rules of conduct of the races. The current version of the [[deed of gift]] is the third revision of the original deed.&lt;ref name="text"&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Deed of Gift}} from [[Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt; The original deed was written in 1852 and forwarded to the [[New York Yacht Club]] on July 8, 1857.&lt;ref&gt;''The Deed of Gift of the America's Cup and related manuscripts from the archives of the New York Yacht Club Revised Edition'' (2007) by Ryoichi Steven Tsuchiya&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history==
The surviving members of the syndicate which owned the yacht [[America (yacht)|''America'']], the first winner of what would become the [[America's Cup]] (née  “Royal Yacht Squadron Cup” or the “RYS Cup for One Hundred Sovereigns”),{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} donated the America's Cup through a [[deed of gift]] to the New York Yacht Club on July 8, 1857. The cup would be held in trust as a “challenge trophy" to promote friendly competition among nations, with the deed of gift being the primary instrument governing the rules to make a valid challenge for the [[America’s Cup]] and the rules of conduct of the races.

After the 1881 Cup match, the [[New York Yacht Club]] officially returned the Cup to [[George L. Schuyler]], the sole surviving member of the syndicate that owned ''America'' to rewrite the deed to discourage inland-based yacht clubs from challenging the Cup.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} This revised Deed incorporated, among other things, the following rules: the challenger’s yacht club's annual regatta must take place on the sea or on an arm of the sea, and the challenging boat must sail to the site of the contest on her own bottom, as the yacht ''America'' did when first winning the cup in England.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lawson History of the America's Cup'' (1902) by Winfield M. Thompson and Thomas W. Lawson&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, the challenging yacht’s hull was much longer than originally stated by the challenger, a potential advantage. The difference alarmed the N.Y.Y.C., but they rectified the situation by handicapping the challenger. Although the N.Y.Y.C. successfully defended the Cup that year, the problem spurred them to rewrite the Deed. Once again the club officially returned the Cup to Schuyler. The third Deed is much longer and couched in legal terminology. The third Deed tightened the rules for challenging; for example, it stated explicitly that the challenger must not exceed the dimensions provided to the holder of the Cup. The new version of the rules created an uproar among many British yachtsmen, who claimed that the new rules made it impossible to challenge.{{why|date=September 2013}} No one challenged until six years later, when British railroad tycoon [[James Lloyd Ashbury]] set forth his first of two challenges.

After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the N.Y.Y.C. amended the Deed by changing the requirement regarding waterline length: the minimum waterline length was reduced from {{convert|65|ft}} to {{convert|44|ft}} to allow the use of the [[12-metre class]]. In addition, the rule that the challenging boat had to sail on her own bottom to the site of the match was eliminated, permitting boats to be shipped to the venue without requiring them to be able to sail across oceans (or contain living accommodations).

In 1985 a second amendment was made to allow for matches to take place during the summer in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bymnews.com/new/content/view/8582/80/ BYM News] More about the Deed of Gift &amp; subsequent changes.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
The Deed of Gift is a registered Trust document in the [[New York Supreme Court]] in [[Manhattan]] (New York County), [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref name="2009Case" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2015|reason=But compare to footnote 3 of reference.}} which is a [[trial court|court of first instance]], unlike [[supreme court]]s of other jurisdictions. An interpretation of the document, when contested, can be taken before that Court for clarification on whether the Deed of Gift's terms and conditions (as written by George L. Schuyler) are being met.

The wording of the deed is comparatively straightforward but written in the legal language, style and terminology of the time it was written. In later years this has given rise to disputes relating to the meaning of particular phrases and words and clarified or further confused by taking a view on what the donor actually intended when the deed was written.

There have been two instances of litigation regarding interpretation appealed to the [[New York Court of Appeals]], that state's [[Supreme court|highest court]]. The first concerned the challenge for the [[1988 America's Cup]], where the question was first, whether the [[Mercury Bay]] Boating Club was a valid challenger and if the [[San Diego Yacht Club]] had to accept their challenge; and second, whether the Defender's boat (a [[catamaran]]) complied with the terms of the Deed of Gift. The answer was yes to both questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/mercury_sandiego.htm|title=Mercury Bay Boating Club v San Diego Yacht Club)|website=www.courts.state.ny.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second concerned [[Société Nautique de Genève]], the defender of the [[2010 America's Cup]], where the question was whether a valid challenge could be accepted by the defender from a 'shell' yacht club that was formed for the specific purpose of challenging and had not previously held a properly constituted annual regatta on an ocean water course or an arm of the sea. The court's answer was no.&lt;ref name="2009Case"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2009/2009_02480.htm|title=Golden Gate Yacht Club v Soci-fet-fe Nautique de Gen-f4ve (2009 NY Slip Op 02480)|website=www.courts.state.ny.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were subsequently a number of additional issues raised regarding the type of boat to be used, the venue and other points which were put to the court by the court adjudicated valid challenger [[Golden Gate Yacht Club]]. All were upheld by the court with the exception of two issues which were open and still awaiting court decisions even after the completion of the 2010 America's Cup races but both sides agreed to drop all outstanding legal actions soon after.

'''DjVu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|eɪ|ʒ|ɑː|ˈ|v|uː}} {{respell|DAY|zhah|VOO|'}}, like French "[[déjà vu]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://djvu.org/|publisher=djvu.org|accessdate=2017-07-02|title=DjVu.org - the premier menu for djvu resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[computer]] [[file format]] designed primarily to store [[image scanner|scanned documents]], especially those containing a combination of text, line drawings, indexed color images, and photographs. It uses technologies such as image layer separation of text and background/images, [[Interlacing (bitmaps)|progressive loading]], [[arithmetic coding]], and [[lossy compression]] for bitonal ([[monochrome]]) images. This allows high-quality, readable images to be stored in a minimum of space, so that they can be made available on the [[World Wide Web|web]].

DjVu has been promoted as providing smaller files than PDF for most scanned documents.&lt;ref name="DjVu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://djvu.org/resources/whatisdjvu.php|title=What is DjVu – DjVu.org|publisher=DjVu.org|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DjVu developers report that color magazine pages compress to 40–70&amp;nbsp;kB, black-and-white technical papers compress to 15–40&amp;nbsp;kB, and ancient manuscripts compress to around 100&amp;nbsp;kB; a satisfactory [[JPEG]] image typically requires 500&amp;nbsp;kB.&lt;ref name=djvupaper&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Léon Bottou |author2=Patrick Haffner |author3=Paul G.

Free creators, manipulators, converters, browser plug-ins, and desktop viewers are available.&lt;ref&gt;http://djvu.org djvu.org&lt;/ref&gt; DjVu is supported by a number of multi-format document viewers and e-book reader software on Linux ([[Okular]], [[Evince]]) and Windows ([[SumatraPDF]]).

== History ==
The DjVu technology was originally developed&lt;ref name=djvupaper/&gt; by [[Yann LeCun]], [[Léon Bottou]], Patrick Haffner, and Paul G. Howard at [[AT&amp;T Labs]] from 1996 to 2001.

Due to its declared higher compression ratio (and thus smaller file size) and the ease of converting large volumes of text into DjVu format, and because it is an [[open file format]], it has been considered superior to [[PDF]]. Independent technologist  [[Brewster Kahle]] in a 2004 talk on IT Conversations discussed the benefits of allowing easier access to DjVu files.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail400.html|author=Brewster Kahle|title=Universal Access to All Knowledge|format=Audio; Speech at 1h:31m:20s|publisher=Conversations Network|date=December 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ecmconnection.com/doc/lizardtech-to-open-source-a-djvu-java-viewer-0001 |title=LizardTech To Open Source A DjVu Java Viewer |website=ECM Connection|date=7 December 2004|author= |accessdate= 18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DjVu library distributed as part of the open-source package ''DjVuLibre'' has become the reference implementation for the DjVu format. DjVuLibre has been maintained and updated by the original developers of DjVu since 2002.&lt;ref name="sourceforge.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://djvu.sourceforge.net/|title=DjVuLibre: Open Source DjVu library and viewer|website=djvu.sourceforge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DjVu file format specification has gone through a number of revisions, the most recent being from 2005.

=== Role in the software ecosystem ===

The primary usage of the DjVu format has been the electronic distribution of documents with a quality comparable to that of printed documents. As that niche is also the primary usage for PDF, it was inevitable that the two formats would become competitors. It should however be observed that the two formats approach the problem of delivering high resolution documents in very different ways: PDF primarily encodes graphics and text as vectorised data, whereas DjVu primarily encodes them as [[pixmap]] images. This means PDF places the burden of [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] the document on the reader, whereas DjVu places that burden on the creator.

During a number of years, significantly overlapping with the period when DjVu was being developed, there were no PDF viewers for free operating systems — a particular stumbling block was the rendering of vectorised fonts, which are essential for combining small file size with high resolution in PDF. Since displaying DjVu was a simpler problem for which free software was available, there were suggestions that the [[free software movement]] should employ DjVu instead of PDF for distributing documentation; rendering for creating DjVu is in principle not much different from rendering for a device-specific printer driver, and DjVu can as a last resort be generated from scans of paper media. However when [[FreeType]] 2.0 in 2000 began provide rendering of all major vectorised font formats, that specific advantage of DjVu began to erode.

In the 2000s, with the growth of the [[world wide web]] and before widespread adoption of [[broadband]], DjVu was often adopted by [[digital library|digital libraries]] as their format of choice, thanks to its integration with software like [[Greenstone (software)|Greenstone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.greenstone.org/doku.php?id=nzdl:projects|title=NZDL projects and Demonstrations}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Internet Archive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.lib.uiowa.edu/hardinmd/2008/09/05/google-books-vs-djvu-in-internet-archive/|title=Google Books vs DjVu in Internet Archive|date=2018-09-05|author=Eric Rumsey}}&lt;/ref&gt; browser plugins which allowed advanced online browsing, smaller file size for comparable quality of book scans and other image-heavy documents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.lib.uiowa.edu/hardinmd/2008/09/10/djvu-again/|title=DjVu again|date=2018-09-10|author=Eric Rumsey}}&lt;/ref&gt; and support for embedding and searching full text from [[Optical character recognition|OCR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.archive.org/2004/12/09/new-book-collection-color-scans-djvu-some-pdf/|title=New book collection: color scans, djvu, some pdf|date=2004-12-09|author=Jeff Kaplan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some features such as the thumbnail previews were later integrated in the Internet Archive's BookReader&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.lib.uiowa.edu/hardinmd/2010/10/19/internet-archives-bookreader-thumbnail-view/|title=Internet Archive's BookReader Thumbnail View|date=2010-09-10|author=Eric Rumsey}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DjVu browsing was deprecated in its favour as around 2015 some major browsers stopped supporting [[Java applet]]s and DjVu plugins with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/post/1053214/djvu-files-for-new-uploads|date=2016-02-26|title=DjVu files for new uploads |author=[[Brewster Kahle]] and Jeff Kaplan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical overview ==

=== File structure ===
The DjVu file format is based on the [[Interchange File Format]] and is composed of hierarchically organized chunks. The IFF structure is preceded by a 4-byte &lt;code&gt;AT&amp;T&lt;/code&gt; [[magic number (programming)|magic number]]. Following is a single &lt;code&gt;FORM&lt;/code&gt; chunk with a secondary identifier of either &lt;code&gt;DJVU&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;DJVM&lt;/code&gt; for a single-page or a multi-page document, respectively.

==== Chunk types ====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Chunk identifier !! Contained by !! Description
|-
| FORM:DJVU || FORM:DJVM || Describes a single page. Can either be at the root of a document and be a single-page document or referred to from a &lt;code&gt;DIRM&lt;/code&gt; chunk. 
|-
| FORM:DJVM || {{n/a}} || Describes a multi-page document. Is the document's root chunk.
|-
| FORM:DJVI || FORM:DJVM || Contains data shared by multiple pages.
|-
| FORM:THUM || FORM:DJVM || Contains thumbnails.
|-
| INFO || FORM:DJVU || Must be the first chunk. Describes the page width, height, format version, [[pixel density|resolution]], [[gamma correction|gamma]], and rotation.
|-
| DIRM || FORM:DJVM || Must be the first chunk. References other &lt;code&gt;FORM&lt;/code&gt; chunks. These chunks can either follow this chunk inside the &lt;code&gt;FORM:DJVM&lt;/code&gt; chunk or be contained in external files. These types of documents are referred to as ''bundled'' or ''indirect'', respectively.
|-
| NAVM || FORM:DJVM || If present, must immediately follow the &lt;code&gt;DIRM&lt;/code&gt; chunk. Contains a BZZ-compressed outline of the document.
|}

=== Compression ===
DjVu divides a single image into many different images, then compresses them separately. To create a DjVu file, the initial image is first separated into three images: a background image, a foreground image, and a mask image. The background and foreground images are typically lower-resolution color images (e.g., 100 dpi); the mask image is a high-resolution bilevel image (e.g., 300 dpi) and is typically where the text is stored. The background and foreground images are then compressed using a [[Wavelet compression#Wavelet compression|wavelet-based compression]] algorithm named IW44.&lt;ref name=djvupaper/&gt; The mask image is compressed using a method called JB2 (similar to [[JBIG2]]). The JB2 encoding method identifies nearly identical shapes on the page, such as multiple occurrences of a particular character in a given font, style, and size. It compresses the bitmap of each unique shape separately, and then encodes the locations where each shape appears on the page. Thus, instead of compressing a letter "e" in a given font multiple times, it compresses the letter "e" once (as a compressed bit image) and then records every place on the page it occurs.

Optionally, these shapes may be mapped to [[UTF-8]] codes (either by hand or potentially by a [[Text recognition|text recognition system]]) and stored in the DjVu file. If this mapping exists, it is possible to select and copy text.

Since JBIG2 was based on JB2, both compression methods have the same problems when performing lossy compression.  Numbers may be substituted with similarly looking numbers (such as replacing 6 with 8) if the text was scanned at a low resolution prior to lossy compression.

== Format licensing ==
DjVu is an [[open file format]] with patents.&lt;ref name="DjVu"/&gt; The file format specification is published, as well as source code for the reference library.&lt;ref name="DjVu"/&gt; The original authors distribute an [[Open-source software|open-source]] implementation named "''DjVuLibre''" under the [[GNU General Public License]]. The rights to the commercial development of the encoding software have been transferred to different companies over the years, including [[AT&amp;T Corporation]], [[LizardTech]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lizardtech.com/company/about|title=Company - About - LizardTech|first=|last=Extensis|website=www.lizardtech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Celartem''&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=3066794|title=Celartem, Inc.: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Cuminas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cuminas.jp/company|title=会社情報 - Cuminas Corporation|website=www.cuminas.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celartem acquired [[LizardTech]] and Extensis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celartem.com/en/company-overview/|title=Company Overview - Celartem Technology, Inc.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.extensis.com/newsroom/celartem-technology-announces-merger-of-us-holdings/|title=Celartem Technology Announces Merger of US Holdings - Extensis.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=3046493|title=Celartem Technology Inc.: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigpicture.net/content/celartem-sells-extensis-and-lizardtech-plugins-and-xtensions-onone-software|title=Celartem Sells Extensis and LizardTech Plugins and XTensions to onOne Software - Big Picture - Wide Format Printing|website=bigpicture.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Despite its advantages, DjVu is not widely supported by scanning and viewing software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xeroxscanners.com/downloads/Manuals/OT4/OneTouchGuide.EN.pdf Manual for Xerox/Visioneer OneTouch], widely used scanning software for business and home use, showing support for several file formats, but not DjVu.&lt;/ref&gt; While viewers can be downloaded, opening DjVu files is not implemented in most operating systems by default.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/File:Test_rs20846.djvu A test DjVu file]. Click on the image in the page to open the file on a computer with support for the .djvu format.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the DjVu file format was chosen by the [[Internet Archive]] as a format in which its ''[[Million Book Project]]'' provides scanned [[public-domain]] books online (along with [[TIFF]] and PDF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.laptop.org/go/DJVU |title=Image file formats – OLPC |publisher=Wiki.laptop.org |date= |accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikimedia Commons]], a media repository used by [[Wikipedia]] among others, conditionally permits PDF and DjVu media files.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:Commons:Scope#PDF and DjVu formats|Wikimedia Commons. Project scope: PDF and DjVu]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Third party tools using APIs and SDKs can create and manipulate DjVu files.&lt;ref name="sourceforge.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwilk.net/software/|title=Jakub Wilk's software|website=jwilk.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bitbucket.org/jsbien/ndt/wiki/wyniki|title=DjVu tools - Poliqarp for DjVu search engine and others|website=bitbucket.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://djvu.org/forum/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=146|title=PlanetDjVu • Why won't Google index DjVu files after all this time?|website=djvu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[SumatraPDF]] (Windows)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522025420/http://any2djvu.djvuzone.org/|title=Any2DjVu Server|date=22 May 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djvu-soft.narod.ru/soft/|title=Table of Djvu Programmes (Russian)|website=www.djvu-soft.narod.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.djvu-pdf.com/|title=DjVu to PDF: Convert your DjVus to PDF online instantly|website=www.djvu-pdf.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8481">The '''Ethiopian language area''' is a hypothesized [[Sprachbund|linguistic area]] that was first proposed by [[Charles A. Ferguson]] (1970, 1976), who posited a number of phonological and morphosyntactic features that were found widely across [[Ethiopia]], which then included [[Eritrea]], including the [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethio-Semitic]], [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] and [[Omotic languages]] but not the [[Nilo-Saharan languages]]. 

Others scholars have since pointed out smaller areas of shared features within the larger area (Appleyard 1989, Breeze 1988, Sasse 1986, Tosco 1994, Wedekind 1989).

One of area's most notable features seems to be the use of the verb "say" as an inflected dummy element for an uninflected lexical base (Appleyard 2001, Cohen ''et al.'' 2002). Hayward also pointed out patterns of [[lexicalisation]] as evidence of a shared linguistic unity across the area (1999, 2000), and Treis noted further examples (2010).

Though Tosco earlier accepted that the area's status had "long been well established" (1994:415), he later challenged Ferguson's work as flawed (2000). He concludes that the Ethiopian language area is not valid and suggests that Ferguson's work reflects the politics of his time, when there was a strong emphasis on Ethiopian unity, as reflected in [[Donald N. Levine]]'s book ''Greater Ethiopia: The Evolution of a Multiethnic Society.''&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald. 1974. ''Greater Ethiopia: The Evolution of a Multiethnic Society.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baye Yiman has shown evidence of pragmatic similarities among languages of the Ethiopian language area (1997).

Güldemann has proposed that the use of a generic auxiliary is an area feature that includes Ethiopia but also other languages to its west and northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Güldemann. 2005. Complex predicates based on generic auxiliaries as an [[areal feature]] in [[Northeastern Africa]]. ''Studies in Africamn Linguistic Typology'' ed. by F. K. Erhard Voeltz, pp. 131-154. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Cohen, Simeone-Senelle, and Vanhove have examined the grammaticalised use of "say" and "do" as an area feature of what the scholars call "[[East Africa]]".&lt;ref&gt;David Cohen, Marie-Claude Simeone-Senelle, and Martine Vanhove. 2002. The grammaticalization of "say" and "do": An areal phenomenon in East Africa. ''Reported discourse: a meeting ground for different linguistic domains'', ed. by Güldemann, Tom and Manfred von Roncador, pp. 227-251. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wu Tong has examined prenominal relative clauses as an areal feature in the Ethiopian language area. &lt;ref&gt;Wu Tong. 2012. Prenominal relative clauses in Ethiopian languages: from inside and from outside. ''Studies in African Linguistics'', Volume 41, Number 2:213-252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolemariam Fufa Teso has done a broad comparative study of verbal derivation across the area.&lt;ref&gt;Fufa Teso, Tolemariam. ''A typology of verbal derivation in Ethiopian Afro-Asiatic languages''. LOT, Utrecht, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of the area is still debated.

The '''Family History Library''' ('''FHL''') is a [[genealogy|genealogical]] research facility in [[downtown Salt Lake City]]. The library is open to the public free of charge and is operated by [[FamilySearch]], the genealogical arm of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).

==History==
The origins of the Family History Library can be traced to the founding of the [[Genealogical Society of Utah]] in 1894. Through time the Library has changed locations within Salt Lake City as follows:
* The Society's first library was located in the office of the Church Historian at 58 E. South Temple Street&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Library/FHL/frameset_library.asp?PAGE=library_history.asp | title=History of the Family History Library | publisher=FamilySearch.org | accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Church Administration Building]] 47 E. South Temple Street (1917–1933)
* 80 N. Main Street (1934–1962)
* 100 S. Main Street (1962–1971)
* [[Church Office Building]] 50 E. North Temple Street (1972–1985)
* 35 N. West Temple Street (1985–Present)

The current library building, just west of [[Temple Square]] was opened on October 23, 1985, and cost $8.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Happy 25th birthday, Family History Library! |author=R. Scott Lloyd |newspaper=Church News |date=23 October 2010 |url=http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/60040/Happy-25th-birthday-Family-History-Library.html |accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 the Genealogical Society of Utah began to [[microfilm]] records which contained genealogical data from around the world, and today this microfilm makes up much of the library's collection. Today the Genealogical Society of Utah is more commonly known as FamilySearch, and is currently working on digitizing many of its microfilm collections to be shared online.

==Purpose==
Its main purpose is to fulfill one of the LDS Church fundamental tenets: that deceased family members, especially [[ancestor]]s, can be [[baptism for the dead|baptized]] by proxy, as well as receive other [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)#Saving ordinances|saving ordinances]]. These ordinances are performed in [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/background-information/genealogy-family-history | title=Genealogy (Family History) | work=Newsroom.lds.org | publisher=LDS Church | accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its collection has grown, however, more individuals throughout the world are using the collection to research their ancestry and chart their genealogy.

==Services==
The library is in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], where the headquarters of the LDS Church are located. It is the largest genealogical library in the world and is open to the general public at no charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.intl-research.com/overview.htm | title=AAG International Research | publisher=AAG International Research | accessdate=2009-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library holds genealogical records for over 110 countries, territories, and possessions. Its collections include over 1.6 million rolls of microfilmed records onsite and access the total collection of more than 2.4 million rolls of [[microfilm]]ed genealogical records; 727,000 [[microfiche]]; 356,000 books, [[Serial (literature)|serials]], and other formats; 4,500 [[periodicals]]; 3,725 electronic resources including subscriptions to the major genealogical websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.familysearch.org/eng/library/FHL/frameset_library.asp | title=About the Family History Library | publisher=FamilySearch.org | accessdate=March 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library offers research assistance to help patrons trace their own family history. Professional genealogists and volunteers offer assistance in about 30 languages, which includes reading and translating genealogically relevant documents.  The library also offers free one-on-one consultations on difficult research problems. Additionally, there are classes on genealogical research topics free to the public&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.familysearch.org/eng/library/education/frameset_education.asp?PAGE=education_library_classes.asp%3FActiveTab=4 | title=Family History Library Classes | publisher=FamilySearch.org | accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and classes available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.familysearch.org/eng/library/education/frameset_education.asp?PAGE=education_research_series_online.asp%3FActiveTab=2 | title= Research Series Classes Online | publisher=FamilySearch.org | accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free family history research advice and information are offered online at the FamilySearch Research Wiki.

==Digitization and indexing projects==
{{Main|FamilySearch Indexing}}

The library is in the process of digitizing much of its microfilm collection.  An online index to some of the records is also being created. Volunteers to the project are now being actively solicited at FamilySearchIndexing.org. The searchable database containing the digital images and index will be available through the church's [[FamilySearch]] website. 

==Branches==
{{Main|Family History Center (LDS Church)}}
Branches of the library are called [[Family History Center (LDS Church)|Family History Centers]] (FHC). While there are over 4,400 family history centers operating in more than 134 countries there are only about 17 major [[List of Large Family History Centers (LDS Church)|regional branch library]] class facilities. The others are ward, branch and stake facilities with at least one or more genealogical computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.familysearch.org/eng/library/fhc/frameset_fhc.asp?PAGE=library_fhc_about.asp | title=About Family History Centers | publisher=FamilySearch.org | accessdate=March 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For details, see [[Family History Center (LDS Church)]]. Most of the microfilms in the main library's collection can be loaned to a family history center for a nominal charge. These centers are staffed by volunteers, and, like the main library, are free of charge and open to the public (LDS Church members and nonmembers alike).

==1999 shooting==
On April 15, 1999, 70-year-old Sergei Babarin entered the Library's lobby and began shooting. A security guard and one female patron were killed while several others were injured. One hour and 45 minutes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Library shooting incident -- the key events A chronology from 10:30 a.m. to just after 5 |newspaper= Deseret News |date= April 16, 1999 |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/691795/Library-shooting-incident----the-key-events.html |accessdate= 2013-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after the shooting began, Salt Lake police shot and fatally wounded Babarin in an exchange of gunfire. Babarin's family indicated he had a history of schizophrenia, a claim not corroborated by the Valley Community Mental Health Clinic.&lt;ref name=Ogata&gt;{{cite news |title= Infamous shooting incidents in Salt Lake County |first= Wendy |last= Ogata |newspaper= Deseret News |date= 13 February 2007 |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/660195182/Infamous-shooting-incidents-in-Salt-Lake-County.html |accessdate= 2013-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred only four months after a separate shooting incident a block away at the [[Triad Center]].&lt;ref name=Ogata /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1374">In '''Garfinkle v Estate Garfinkle''', an important case in the South African law of succession, the testator had a shop attached to his house and a large sum of money. The will stated that the shop was to be advertised for hire by tender and the minimum price acceptable was 30 shilling per month, plus a 500 pound security deposit. Furthermore, the will stated that the prospective leasee was to provide three certificates, stating that he was of good character, from a teacher, magistrate and a priest.

The prospective leasee was also required to continue making "Garfinkle’s Improved Aerated Drink," and to be the librarian of the library on the property. In this regard, the prospective leasee ought to keep the books under lock and key and only allow persons to peruse them if under constant supervision. Furthermore, the money was to be kept in the post office forever.

As a result of the conditions attached to the shop, no tenders were received, so the executors of the estate sought to declare the conditions invalid. The court held that the conditions were impossible to fulfill due to the complex and onerous burden imposed on any prospective leasee. Thus the testator was held to have died intestate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1802">The '''Genealogical Proof Standard''' ('''GPS''') is a guideline for establishing the reliability ("proof") of a [[Genealogy|genealogical]] conclusion with reasonable certainty.  It is important within the genealogical community for clearly communicating the quality of research performed, such as by a professional genealogist.  It is also useful for helping new genealogists understand what is needed to do high-quality research.

It has five elements:
* a reasonably exhaustive research;
* complete and accurate source [[citation]]s;
* analysis and correlation of the collected information;
* resolution of any conflicting [[evidence]]; and
* a soundly reasoned, coherently written conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Board for Certification of Genealogists ® - The Genealogical Proof Standard|url = http://www.bcgcertification.org/resources/standard.html|website = www.bcgcertification.org|access-date = 2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lowercase}}
The  [[function (computer science)|function]]s '''''getaddrinfo()''''' and '''''getnameinfo()'''''  convert [[domain name]]s, [[hostname]]s, and [[IP address]]es between human-readable text representations and structured binary formats for the [[operating system]]'s networking API. Both functions are contained in the [[POSIX]] standard [[application programming interface]] (API).

getaddrinfo and getnameinfo are inverse functions of each other. They are network protocol agnostic, and support both [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]. It is the recommended interface for name resolution in building protocol independent applications and for transitioning legacy IPv4 code to the IPv6 Internet.

Internally, the functions perform resolutions using the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) by calling other, lower level functions, such as [[Berkeley_sockets#gethostbyname.28.29_and_gethostbyaddr.28.29|gethostbyname()]].

On February 16 2016 a security bug was announced in the [[glibc]] implementation of getaddrinfo(), using a [[buffer overflow]] technique, that may allow execution of arbitrary code by the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.ca/2016/02/cve-2015-7547-glibc-getaddrinfo-stack.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==struct addrinfo==
The [[C (programming language)|C]] data structure used to represent addresses and hostnames within the networking API is the following:
&lt;source lang="c++" start="0"&gt;
struct addrinfo {
    int       ai_flags;
    int       ai_family;
    int       ai_socktype;
    int       ai_protocol;
    socklen_t ai_addrlen;
    struct    sockaddr* ai_addr;
    char*     ai_canonname;      /* canonical name */
    struct    addrinfo* ai_next; /* this struct can form a linked list */
};
&lt;/source&gt;

In some older systems the type of ''ai_addrlen'' is ''size_t'' instead of ''socklen_t''. Most socket functions, such as ''accept()'' and ''getpeername()'', require the parameter to have type ''socklen_t * '' and programmers often pass the address to the ''ai_addrlen'' element of the ''addrinfo'' structure. If the types are incompatible, e.g., on a 64-bit [[Solaris 9]] system where ''size_t'' is 8 bytes and ''socklen_t'' is 4 bytes, then run-time errors may result.

The structure contains structures ''ai_family'' and ''sockaddr'' with its own ''sa_family'' field. These are set to the same value when the structure is created with function ''getaddrinfo'' in some implementations.

==getaddrinfo()==
getaddrinfo() converts human-readable text strings representing [[hostname]]s or [[IP address]]es into a [[Dynamic memory allocation|dynamically allocated]] [[linked list]] of struct addrinfo structures.
The function prototypes for these functions are specified as follows:
&lt;source lang="c++"&gt;

#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netdb.h&gt;

int getaddrinfo(const char* hostname,
                const char* service,
                const struct addrinfo* hints,
                struct addrinfo** res);
&lt;/source&gt;

; hostname
: can be either a domain name, such as "example.com", an address string, such as "127.0.0.1", or NULL, in which case the address 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 is assigned depending on the hints flags.
; service
: can be a port number passed as string, such as "80", or a service name, e.g. "echo". In the latter case a typical implementation uses ''getservbyname()'' to query the file ''/etc/services'' to resolve the service to a port number.
; hints
: can be either NULL or an ''addrinfo'' structure with the type of service requested.
; res
: is a pointer that points to a new ''addrinfo'' structure with the information requested after successful completion of the function.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens R., Fenner, Rudoff [2003] UNIX® Network Programming Volume 1, Third Edition: The Sockets Networking API. Publisher: Addison-Wesley Professional. Pub. Date: November 14, 2003 p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; The function returns 0 upon success and non-zero error value if it fails.&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/ Accessed 31.5.2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Although implementations vary among platforms, the function first attempts to obtain a port number usually by branching on ''service''. If the string value is a number, it converts it to an integer and calls ''htons()''. If it is a service name, such as ''www'', the service is lookup with ''getservbyname()'', using the protocol derived from ''hints-&gt;ai_socktype'' as the second parameter to that function. Then, if ''hostname'' is given (not NULL), a call to ''gethostbyname()'' resolves it, or otherwise the address ''0.0.0.0'' is used, if ''hints-&gt;ai_flags'' is set to ''AI_PASSIVE'', and ''127.0.0.1'' otherwise. It allocated a new ''addrinfo'' structure filled with the appropriate ''sockaddr_in'' in one of these conditions and also adds the port retrieved at the beginning to it. Finally, the ''**res'' parameter is dereferenced to make it point to a newly allocated ''addrinfo'' structure.&lt;ref&gt;Hajimu UMEMOTO [2000] getaddrinfo.c Accessed from: https://opensource.apple.com/source/passwordserver_sasl/passwordserver_sasl-14/cyrus_sasl/lib/getaddrinfo.c&lt;/ref&gt; In some implementations, such as the Unix version for Mac OS, the ''hints-&gt;ai_protocol '' overrides the ''hints-&gt;ai_socktype'' value while in others it is the opposite, so both need to be defined with equivalent values for the code to be work across multiple platforms.

==getnameinfo()==
''getnameinfo()'' converts the internal binary representation of an IP address in the form of a ''struct sockaddr'' pointer into text strings consisting of the hostname or, if the address cannot be resolved into a name, a textual IP address representation, as well as the service port name or number. The function prototype is specified as follows:
&lt;source lang="c++"&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netdb.h&gt;

int getnameinfo(const struct sockaddr* sa, socklen_t salen,
                char* host, size_t hostlen,
                char* serv, size_t servlen,
                int flags);
&lt;/source&gt;

==freeaddrinfo()==
This function frees the memory allocated by the ''getaddrinfo()'' function. As the result of the latter is a linked list of addrinfo structures, '' freeaddrinfo()'' loops through the list and frees each one in turn.

&lt;source lang="c++"&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netdb.h&gt;

void freeaddrinfo(struct addrinfo *ai);
&lt;/source&gt;

* ''ai'' is the head of the addrinfo list

==Example==
The following example uses ''getaddrinfo()'' to resolve the domain name ''www.example.com'' into its list of addresses and then calls ''getnameinfo()'' on each result to return the canonical name for the address. In general, this produces the original [[hostname]], unless the particular address has multiple names, in which case the ''canonical'' name is returned. In this example, the domain name is printed three times, once for each of the three results obtained.

&lt;source lang="c++" highlight="18,31,40"&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;netdb.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

#ifndef   NI_MAXHOST
#define   NI_MAXHOST 1025
#endif

int main(void)
{
    struct addrinfo* result;
    struct addrinfo* res;
    int error;

    /* resolve the domain name into a list of addresses */
    error = getaddrinfo("www.example.com", NULL, NULL, &amp;result);
    if (error != 0) {   
        if (error == EAI_SYSTEM) {
            perror("getaddrinfo");
        } else {
            fprintf(stderr, "error in getaddrinfo: %s\n", gai_strerror(error));
        }   
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }   

    /* loop over all returned results and do inverse lookup */
    for (res = result; res != NULL; res = res-&gt;ai_next) {   
        char hostname[NI_MAXHOST];
        error = getnameinfo(res-&gt;ai_addr, res-&gt;ai_addrlen, hostname, NI_MAXHOST, NULL, 0, 0); 
        if (error != 0) {
            fprintf(stderr, "error in getnameinfo: %s\n", gai_strerror(error));
            continue;
        }
        if (*hostname != '\0')
            printf("hostname: %s\n", hostname);
    }   

    freeaddrinfo(result);
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2908">'''Ingram Bywater''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (27 June 1840 – 18 December 1914&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v94/n2356/abs/094455a0.html Obituary in ''Nature'', Dec. 24th, 1914].&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[England|English]] [[classical scholar]].

[[File:Ingram Bywater.jpg|thumb|Ingram Bywater.]]

He was born in [[Islington]], [[London]] and first educated first at [[University College School]] and [[King's College School]], then at [[Queen's College, Oxford]]. He obtained a first class in Moderations (1860) and in the final classical schools (1862), and became fellow of [[Exeter College, Oxford]] (1863), reader in Greek (1883), [[Regius Professor of Greek (Oxford)|Regius Professor of Greek]] (1893–1908), and [[Christ Church, Oxford#Governing body|Student]] of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. He received honorary degrees from various universities, and was elected corresponding member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]].

He is chiefly known for his editions of Greek philosophical works: ''[[Heraclitus|Heracliti Ephesii]] Reliquiae'' (1877); ''[[Priscian of Lydia|Prisciani Lydi]] quae extant'' (edited for the Berlin Academy in the ''Supplementum Aristotelicum'', 1886); ''[[Aristotle]], [[Nicomachean Ethics|Ethica Nicomachea]]'' (1890), ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|De Arte Poetica]]'' (1898); ''Contributions to the Textual Criticism of the Nicomachean Ethics'' (1892).

Bywater was associated with the Oxford Aristotelian Society from its inception in the early 1880s and remained its principal guiding force until his retirement in 1908. Here he would discuss with scholars such as [[John Alexander Smith|J.A. Smith]], [[Harold Joachim]], and [[W.D. (later Sir David) Ross]] the minutiae of Aristotelian philology, textual criticism, and translation. The Society's discussions led to the full translation of Aristotle's works, first under the joint editorship of J.A. Smith and W.D. Ross and later under Ross as sole editor, between 1912 and 1954.

'''''Letters to Judy: What Kids Wish They Could Tell You''''' is a book published by [[Judy Blume]] in [[1986 in literature|1986]]. It is not a novel, but a collection of letters from children with responses from Blume.

Blume quotes correspondence she receives asking for advice, written by readers of her [[children's books]], boys and girls who feel unable to confide in their parents. The letters come from youngsters 10 years old through the teens and tell about specific problems most of which Blume has addressed in her novels. Some of these kids are loners rejected by peers; others feel neglected at home or hurt by [[divorce]]. A divorced mother herself, Blume is sympathetic to the young people who write to her and sympathizes with parents as well; she intends this book to help them become more aware of their children's needs.

'''liligo.com''' is a [[metasearch engine]] that specialises in travel. Launched in 2006, the website does not sell anything but allows users to compare travel products (flight tickets, hotels, car rentals, buses and trains).

The site is available in the following languages: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]].

== History ==

liligo.com is a production of Findworks Technologies, a start-up founded by Pierre Bonelli, Bertrand de la Ruelle, Xavier Corbel and Mikaël Quilfen in 2005. Based in [[Paris]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Budapest]], the company currently employs around 80 people.

Initially a flight comparison website alone, in 2007 liligo.com launched hotel and package categories. In 2008 the company launched extra features including flexible search and fare alerts. In 2009, the option to compare car rentals was added and in May 2009, the site launched its first television ad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creads.org/blog/actualite-pub-marketing/liligo%25E2%2580%25A9-senvoie-en-lair-avec-sa-derniere-campagne-publicitaire/ http://www.creads.org/blog/actualite-pub-marketing/liligo%E2%80%A9-senvoie-en-lair-avec-sa-derniere-campagne-publicitaire/]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109141946/http://www.creads.org/blog/actualite-pub-marketing/liligo%E2%80%A9-senvoie-en-lair-avec-sa-derniere-campagne-publicitaire/ |date=January  9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An iPhone and iPad app was launched in 2010.

In September 2010, SNCF, via its site Voyages-sncf, announced it would take a major stake in liligo.com for the amount of 20 million Euros, according to Les Echos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sncf.com/resources/fr_FR/press/kits/PR0101_20100923.pdf Communiqué de presse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011030906/http://www.sncf.com/resources/fr_FR/press/kits/PR0101_20100923.pdf |date=2010-10-11 }}, SNCF.com, 23 septembre 2009 in French&lt;/ref&gt;
liligo.com was resold 3 years later to European tourism giant [[ODIGEO]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tnooz.com/article/odigeo-buys-travel-search-liligo], tnooz.com, 9 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, liligo.com purchased VoyagerMoinsCher.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourhebdo.com/actualites/detail/88260/liligo-odigeo-rachete-voyagermoinscher.html] Tour Hebdo, 30 September 2015 in French&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools and Apps ==

liligo.com offers an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] app (including a dedicated iPad app); fare alerts; a newsletter; and a travel news magazine.

== Awards ==

Since 2013, liligo.com has held the title of "Website of the year – The Most Popular" in France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sitedelannee.fr/past-winners/] Site de l'Année&lt;/ref&gt;


==IPO==

Independent Board Member James Hare (James Otis Hare II) oversaw the public launch of parent company eDreams Odigeo on April 4, 2014.&lt;ref name="edreamsodigeo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edreamsodigeo.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2014/03/HR_EDREAMS_26Marzo2015_JHare.pdf |format=PDF |title=HECHO RELEVANTE |website=Edreamsodigeo.com |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

eDreams offered its stock at 10.25 Euros per share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.eu/news/edreams-odigeo-ipo-aftermath/ |title=After IPO, eDreams Odigeo shares plummet 75% in 5 months |publisher=Tech.eu |date=2014-09-11 |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

That stock price had fallen to 1.02 Euros by October 24 of 2014, wiping out over one billion Euros of market capitalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EDR:SM|title=EDR:Soc.Bol SIBE Stock Quote|website=Bloomberg.com |date=2016-06-09 |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some commentators called the launch “Europe’s worst performing IPO of 2014”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnooz.com/article/recovering-ipo-nightmare-edreams-odiego-says-growing/ |title=Down 60%, eDreams Odigeo shares try to escape post-IPO nightmare |publisher=Tnooz.com |date=2014-08-29 |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
eDreams moved quickly, asking their shareholders for authorization to “Discharge to Mr. James Otis Hare for the exercise of his mandate as director of the Company until his resignation as of 25 March, 2015.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.edreamsodigeo.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2014/08/eDreams_ODIGEO-Voting_formAGM_2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
eDreams issued the following announcement: “Effective March 25, 2015, eDreams ODIGEO (“the Company”) accepts the resignation of Mr. James Hare as an Independent member from the Board of Directors”.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.edreamsodigeo.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2014/08/Annual_Corporate_Governance_Report_31March2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, CEO Dana Dunne introduced a new strategy focusing on mobile, revenue diversification and customer experience improvements, which led to a strong turnaround in business performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tnooz.com/article/edreams-odigeo-half-year-results-2015/|title=eDreams Odigeo strategy begins to pay off|website=Tnooz|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunne's new strategy caused that stock price to rise above 3 euros by January 2017. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EDR:SM]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12858">[[Image:Metryka litewska.jpg|thumb|A Lithuanian Metrica of 1511-18, from the chancellery of Lithuanian [[Chancellor|Grand Chancellor]] [[Mikołaj Radziwiłł (1470-1521)|Mikołaj Radziwiłł]], written in [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]].]]
[[Image:Lew Sapieha 11.PNG|thumb|[[Chancellor|Grand Chancellor]] of [[Lithuania]] [[Lew Sapieha]]. Under his supervision the Lithuanian Metrica was reorganized.]]

The '''Lithuanian Metrica''' or the '''Metrica of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania''' ({{lang-la|Acta Magni Ducatus Lithuaniae}},  {{lang-lt|Lietuvos Metrika}}, {{lang-pl|Metryka Litewska}}, or ''Metryka Wielkiego Księstwa Litewskiego''; {{lang-be|Літоўская Метрыка}}, {{lang-uk|Литовська метрика}}) is a collection of the 14–18th century  legal documents of the Chancellery of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] (GDL). Maintained systematically since the 2nd half the 15th century, metrica consisted, initially and primarily, of the copies of the documents issued by the Grand Duke, [[Lithuanian Council of Lords]], and [[Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Seimas]].

The Metrica also included some important externally originated documents (like translations of the issues (''[[yarlyk]]s'') of the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea Khans]], copies of the Muscovy diplomatic documents etc.), the office-keeping documental materials (like registers of acts, inventories of the Metrica itself etc.) The selection of the classes of the documents included in the Metrica had increased since the 2nd half 15th – 16th century and even more so in the 17–18th centuries, extending to include the copies of transcripts of diplomatic correspondence, charters of privileges, wills, verdicts, judicial decrees, even certain kinds of private correspondence, e.g., received by the official persons. Sometimes, the external and thematically not quite related collections of the documents had also been referred to as the part of the Metrica, the word ''Metrica'' here to be understood as the State Archive.&lt;ref name=halyen&gt;Георгій Галенчанка. Метрыка Вялікага Княства Літоўскага // Энцыклапедыя гісторыі Беларусі: У 6 т. Т. 5. / Беларус. Энцыкл. ; Рэдкал.: Г.П.Пашкоў (галоўны рэд.) і інш. – Мн. : БелЭн, 1999. {{ISBN|985-11-0141-9}} (т.5), {{ISBN|5-85700-073-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents of the Metrica were to be preserved interminably.

Effectively, the Metrica had become the core of the Archive of the Grand Duke, later the core of the Main State Archive of the GDL, serving the notifying (judicial-registrative), judicial, referential functions. It had been the source of the authoritative official documents (copies of copies). The Metrica developed parallel to and on the model of the [[Crown Metrica|Crown Metrica of Poland]].

Today, over 600 (estimated) books of the Lithuanian Metrica still exist.

==Names==

The word ''metrica'' generates from {{lang-pl|metryka}} for archive, from {{lang-la|matricula}} for office book.

The first historical names of the collection were ''metrics'', ''books of metrica'', ''metrica''. Since the end of the 16th – beginning of the 17th century, the full official name was ''Metrica of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania''. This would be the most appropriate ''scientific name''.&lt;ref name=halyen/&gt; The dub ''Lithuanian Metrica'' had been occasionally used in the local office books (by analogy with the [[Crown Metrica|Crown Metrica of Poland]]), since the mid-17th century the dub had consolidated its position in the documents of the Warsaw Archives, later in the Archives of Moscow and St. Petersburg, then in the 19–20th centuries Russian, Polish, Belarusian, Lithuanian historiographies. The name ''Lithuanian Metrica'' is till now traditionally used in the Western publications of the Metrica.
The name ''Lithuanian Metrica'' is also used in reference to some contemporary archival collections, including some of the materials of the Chancellery of the GDL (together with other unrelated materials), chiefly in Russia custody.&lt;ref name=halyen/&gt;

==Languages==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Belarusian language]] --&gt;

The ''prevailing'' language of the documents of the 15th and the most of the 16th century Metrica had been the [[Ruthenian language]]. Alternatively, the prevailing use of the Ruthenian language in the Metrica is extended up to the mid-17th century. The documents, concerned with the Western Europe, had been issued in Latin, occasionally in German. The documents, concerned with the Roman Catholic Church, had been issued in Latin.&lt;ref name=abets&gt;Л. Абецадарскі. У святле неабвержных фактаў. – Мн. : Друк-ня газеты «Звязда», 1969. –  Бібліятэчка газеты «Голас Радзімы».&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Ruthenian_language#Nomenclature|naming of the Ruthenian language]].

Since the late 16th – early 17th century, the number of the documents composed in Polish and in Latin, had been steadily increasing, until the complete elimination of the Ruthenian from the office use in the GDL, and further official ban on the Ruthenian for the official use (1696). The language of the 17–18th century Metrica is mostly Polish and partly Latin.

==History==
State archives were begun in the 13th-century [[Kingdom of Lithuania]].&lt;ref name= "Pašuta" &gt;Vladimiras Pašuta. ''Lietuvos valstybės susidarymas''. Vilnius, 1987, t. 2, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Diplomacy was greatly increased under the rule of [[Gediminas]]. During the various wars, floods, and city fires that followed, many official documents were lost. Some were  impossible to trace,  if these documents had not been duplicated or otherwise copied. A growing need to reproduce these documents later, and the mounting number of edicts, wills, court verdicts etc., determined the evolution of the Lithuanian Metrica.  

The Lithuanian Metrica was stored in the [[Trakai Island Castle]] under the supervision of the [[Treasurer]], until 1511.  Afterwards the documents were transferred to [[Vilnius]], and kept in what was referred to as the [[Royal Palace of Lithuania|Lower Castle]]. The responsibility for safeguarding the Metrica there, was supervised by the State Chancellor. By 1569, when the regions of [[Podlasie]], [[Volhynia]], [[Podolia]] and the [[Kiev]] were separated from Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and incorporated into the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]], the books which concerned these regions, were removed from the Lithuanian Metrica, and merged into the Crown Metrica. Due to the deterioration of the books, the State [[Chancellor|Grand Chancellor]], [[Lew Sapieha]], ordered the volumes of the Metrica to be recopied in 1594. The recopying process continued until 1607. The newly recopied books were  inventoried, rechecked, and transferred to a separate building in Vilnius, with the older books remaining in the [[Vilnius Castles|Castle of Vilnius]]. 

Great parts of the Metrica  were lost during the wars with [[Muscovy]], and others were taken way by [[Sweden|Swedish]] armies in 1656–1657. Only after the [[Treaty of Oliva]] (1660), did the Swedes return many books from the Metrica, but some of them were lost at sea, in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], during transport back to Lithuania. 

The Metrica from Vilnius was taken to [[Warsaw]] in 1765.&lt;ref name= Janulaitis &gt;Augustinas Janulaitis.  ''Praeitis ir jos tyrimo rūpesčiai''. Vilnius, Mokslas, 1989,  p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; The books were bound, cataloged and integrated into the system that was in use, in Warsaw. According to an edict issued in 1793, the Lithuanian Metrica was to be transferred from Warsaw to Vilnius again. After the [[Third Partition of Poland]] (1795), the  Lithuanian Metrica was transferred from Warsow to [[Russia]] as a war trophy and was kept in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Russia gave several of the Lithuanian Metrica books to [[Prussia]] in 1799.  Afterwards Prussia transferred these books to the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] in 1807. The remaining Lithuanian Metrica books in St. Petersburg were inventoried and taken to [[Moscow]]. The majority of the historical Lithuanian Metrica's books have been kept in Russia, and today only a small fraction of them are in [[Lithuania]]. 

The remaining part of the Lithuanian Metrica is kept in Poland, at the [[Central Archives of Historical Records]] in Warsaw.

==Publications==
The Metrica is one of the most authoritative and revered sources on the history of the GDL. Some of the documents of the Metrica and parts of them had begun to be published in the end 18th century. Larger collections of the materials had begun to be published since 1830s («Digest of Prince Obolyenskiy», altern. «Ambassador’s Book of the Metrica...», in 3 volumes, includes detailed register of the books of the Metrica by Anastasyevich (1817)). Other notable publishers of the Metrica materials had been Lyeontovich, Prohaska, Bershadskiy and others. Other notable publications of the period:
* Acts of the Lithuanian Metrica (Акты Литовской метрики, т. 1, в. 1 – 2, Варшава, 1896–1897).
* Acts of the Western Russia (Акты Западной России, full name: Акты, относящиеся к истории Западной России, собранные и изданные Археографическою комиссиею. – СПб., 1846–1853).
:: Consists of about two thousand official documents (not all of them belonging to the Metrica proper), published in five volumes, covering the period of 1340–1699 (I: 1340–1506, II: 1506–1544, III: 1544–1587, IV: 1588–1632, V: 1633–1699).

In 1980s–1990s there had begun a new wave of the publishing of the Metrica materials, this time as an international, Belarusian–Lithuanian–Polish–Russian effort.

The Metrica had served as a basis for the works of the notable researchers of the GDL history, e.g., Lyubavskiy, Dovnar-Zapol’skiy, Maksimeyka, Lappo, Pichyeta, Malinovskiy, Lawmyanski and others.

The scientific research of the Metrica itself had begun with the work of Ptaszycki (1887). Other notable researchers of the Metrica: Byeryezhkov, Grimstead, Sułkowska-Kurasiowa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26183">'''Lord Darcy''' is a [[detective]] in an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]], created by [[Randall Garrett]]. The first stories were asserted to take place in the same year as they were published, but in a world with an alternate history that is different from our own and that is governed by the rules of magic rather than the rules of physics. Despite the magical trappings, the Lord Darcy stories play fair as [[whodunnit]]s; magic is never used to "cheat" a solution, and indeed, the mundane explanation is often obscured by the leap to assume a magical cause.

==Title character==
Lord Darcy is the Chief Forensic Investigator or Chief Criminal Investigator for the Duke of Normandy (Prince Richard, the brother of the king), and sometime Special Investigator for the High Court of Chivalry. An Englishman, he lives in [[Rouen]], but spends very little time there.  We are told that he speaks Anglo-French with an English accent, and that he speaks several languages and dialects fluently.

His full name is never given; he is always referred to by his title as the Lord of Arcy (i.e., Lord d'Arcy or Lord Darcy), even by his friends. He dresses in the style of an English aristocrat. He thinks of himself as English and yet Arcy seems to be a French place name. How he comes to be addressed as a "Lord" is never explained, though he seems deferential when dealing with other Peers such as Dukes, Counts, and a Marquis. In ''[[Too Many Magicians]]'' Darcy is said to be a cousin of the Marquis of London.

There are two conflicting reports of Lord Darcy's age. In "[[The Muddle of the Woad]]" he's described as a few years older than the King, who's ten years older than the Duke of Normandy, who was 19 years old in "[[The Eyes Have It (Lord Darcy story)|The Eyes Have It]]", which is set in 1963. This places Lord Darcy's date of birth around 1931. However, he's described in "[[The Spell of War]]" as an 18-year-old lieutenant in the autumn of the War of '39, which would make him about ten years older.

His assistant is Master [[Sean O'Lochlainn]], a sorcerer who undertakes magical forensic work. Master Sean is highly proud of Irish magic and its superiority to those of other countries (especially to Polish magic).

==Works==
''[[Too Many Magicians]]'' is the only Lord Darcy novel written by Randall Garrett: it first appeared in ''[[Astounding magazine|Analog]]'' magazine from August to November 1966 and was issued in book form by Doubleday in 1967. This was followed by two short story collections: ''[[Murder and Magic]]'' (1979), and ''[[Lord Darcy Investigates]]'' (1981), containing stories that had appeared in ''Analog'', ''Fantastic'' and other magazines. Garrett's extended illness and death prevented him from writing more Lord Darcy tales as he had intended.

Two more Lord Darcy novels, ''[[Ten Little Wizards]]'' (1988), and ''[[A Study in Sorcery]]'' (1989), were written by Garrett's friend [[Michael Kurland]] after Garrett's death. The two titles were manifestly modeled on those of famous detective novels by, respectively, [[Agatha Christie]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. This is similar to the way that ''Too Many Magicians'' was modeled on a famous novel by [[Rex Stout]] (whose [[Nero Wolfe]] and [[Archie Goodwin (character)|Archie Goodwin]] have counterparts in the novel's universe in the Marquis de London and his Special Investigator, Lord Bontriomphe). In the eleventh chapter of ''[[Ten Little Wizards]]'', Kurland sets Lord Darcy's rank in the peerage as a [[Baron]].

==Darcy's world==

===Magic===
Magic is a scientific discipline, codified in the fourteenth century by Saint Hilary Robert, much involved with higher mathematics and possessed of theoretical and experimental underpinnings as sophisticated as those of our physics and chemistry.  Licensed Sorcerers, possessed of the Talent and properly trained, achieve a wide range of effects.  Healing by the laying on of hands is effective and a commonplace treatment for disease and injury; thanks to the efficacy of the Healers, it is common for people to live to the age of 100 and not rare for people to live to 125.

Black magic is not a categorically different type of magic, but a matter of symbolism and intent&amp;mdash;at least in the Anglo-French sphere, as the Kingdom of Italy requests extradition of a woman for black magic when her actual offense was no more than unlicensed magic.  However, the effect of symbolism and intent can be substantial; one character, a Witch-Smeller, is capable of detecting its effects on the black magician and his victims.

Although magic is a central part of all the stories, none of the murders Lord Darcy investigates are directly caused by magic. All the homicides are committed by mundane means.

===Social structure===
France and the  [[British Isles]] are combined into a single state as the Anglo-French Empire, whilst Russia, Italy, and Germany continue as loose collections of small states.  Society is stratified&amp;mdash;most important government positions are held by nobles, who dispense justice and still maintain private soldiers.  The Church is powerful and a central component of everyone's life (there had never been a [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], or it took a very different form, as some of the worst abuses of the late-Medieval/Renaissance Catholic Church seem to have been eliminated or minimized). However, serfdom is as dead as in our own world, and the rights of the common people appear to be as well protected as in our world's Western democracies, if in different ways.

Anglo-French regard themselves as fortunate in comparison to the subjects of the Polish King, who are reported to be living under a terrible tyranny.  The characters expressing this are all living in the Anglo-French countries, but include a Polish refugee, whom the Italian government accused of black magic, and who is compelled to spy for Poland by a threat to her uncle.

===Education===
Little is mentioned of education, although [[Oxford University|Oxford]] continues. Lord Darcy is mentioned as being a graduate of the fictional Magog College (1954).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurland|first=Michael|title=A Study in Sorcery|year=1989|page=48|chapter=5|isbn=0-441-79092-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fictional St. Thomas' Academy is also mentioned.

===Technology===
Technology and physical sciences have suffered somewhat with the emphasis on magic.  Physics has not been codified as a science; the one example of an investigator into the discipline is an eccentric on a par with the members of our own [[Flat Earth Society]].  Most mechanical devices are approximately those of our [[Victorian era]].  Characters travel by horse-drawn carriage and steam train and employ revolving pistols and bolt action rifles; buildings are illuminated with gas lights. An electric torch, with magical parts, is "a fantastic device, a secret of His Majesty's Government."  Messages can be sent by an electrical device called the "teleson", but the principles by which it operates are not well understood, and the technology to lay teleson lines underwater, or over water, has not yet been developed, so it is impossible to communicate across the Channel. Food is sometimes preserved in [[icebox]]es; a magical "food preservator" has been invented, although preservators are expensive and rare because the stasis spell they employ is expensive to maintain, requiring the services of a specialist Journeyman or Master-grade magician.  Sorcery is commonly employed in murder investigations, in much the same fashion as forensic science in our own world.  Medical technology is not as advanced as in our world, because Healers are so effective, indeed the use of drugs with a genuine but non-magical benefit ("may cover a wound with [[Penicillin|moldy bread]]... or give a patient with heart trouble a tea brewed of [[Digitalis|foxglove]]") is regarded as little more than superstition.

===International situation===
The Anglo-French Empire was established by the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenets]], which dynasty has continued to rule (and which continues to use the [[Palace of Westminster]] as a royal residence, with [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] far weaker than in our timeline). [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] returned to England after being wounded at the siege of [[Château de Chalus-Chabrol|Chaluz]], but recovered and ruled well, whilst [[John Lackland]] never held the throne and died in exile. Richard then went on to a decisive victory in the [[Anglo-French War (1202–14)|Anglo-French War]] which in our history King John lost. He dethroned the [[Capetian]] Dynasty and made himself and his successors Kings of France as well as of England, both kingdoms ruled from London, while [[Paris]] was left into the 20th century a provincial town, brooding over its lost glory. The [[Duchy of Normandy]] remained attached to the English crown and was never separated from it. Richard died in 1219 and was succeeded by his nephew [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany|Arthur]] whose reign was remembered as a Golden Age and sometimes confused in the popular imagination with that of [[King Arthur]]. Seven-hundred-fifty years later the present king is "John IV, by the Grace of God, King and Emperor of England, France, Scotland, Ireland [all the Anglo-French Empire], New England [North America], and New France [South America]; Defender of the Faith, et cetera".

To judge by the Irishman who has a central role in the stories, the Irish in this timeline do not feel particularly oppressed under the Anglo-French throne and have no inclination to become independent. Irish history here seems to have been spared traumatic periods of foreign colonisation and dispossession&amp;mdash;and since everybody is Catholic, this Ireland has no problems of rival religious-ethnic communities. Moreover, the Irish are considered especially skilled in Magic - a source of upwards social mobility and prestige. 

The king is also [[Holy Roman Emperor]],&lt;ref&gt;The Point of Divergence when this timeline diverges from ours is just prior to the accession of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] - in our history one of the most important and powerful of Emperors. The information provided by Garret is not detailed enough to determine whether the implications of Richard the Lionheart's survival and takeover of France were enough the prevent his accession in the alternate timeline, and when did the Plantagenets gain possession of the Imperial title.&lt;/ref&gt; exercising loose sovereignty over the many small German and Italian states. However, his actual exercise of sovereignty is limited by the ability of German states to call upon the [[Poles]] for help; the chronologically first Lord Darcy story (though not the first written) takes place during a military confrontation between Anglo-French and Polish forces on the soil of [[Bavaria]].

In Italy the King-Emperor is more of a [[Constitutional monarchy|Constitutional monarch]], with an Italian Parliament seemingly holding much more power than the one in London (in a story set in Italy, a local policeman emphasizes that his oath of office is to the Parliament rather than the King). There is no mention, however, of whether the parliament is appointed or elected, and by whom. Italy being united implies that the [[Catholic Church]] was, like in our history, deprived at some time of its [[Temporal power (papal)| Temporal power]] over the city of Rome and its environs, but there is no mention and when and how this happened.   

Poland is a major power and the chief rival of the Anglo-French, and the two exist in a situation of [[Cold War]]; some of the stories are spy thrillers, where Lord Darcy is pitted against Polish agents and takes on some of the attributes of [[James Bond]] (with some magic ingredients added, such as a spell used to make him fall madly in love with a beautiful female Polish agent).

Hungary is part of the Polish Empire (the University of Buda-Pest is mentioned as one of Poland's major institutes of learning), and the empire seems to extend southwards into the Balkans. It is stated that Kiev is part of the Polish Empire, and most of the Ukrainian steppe. The Russias are no more than a set of fractious statelets, which might unify in the face of Polish aggression but as yet have failed to do so (it had been close to that situation in some periods of our own history&amp;mdash;see [[Polish-Muscovite War (1605–1618)]]).

The main strategy of the Anglo-French is to bottle up the Poles and deny them access to the world's oceans. There is mention of a war in the 1940s (roughly equivalent to [[World War II]], but of a much more limited extent) in which the Polish Navy was decisively beaten. Since then, an alliance with the [[Scandinavia]]ns at the exit from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and with the Roumelians ([[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]) at the exit from the [[Black Sea]] denies passage to Polish warships&amp;mdash;though they try to circumvent this blockade and build an ocean-going navy with the help of some [[Africa]]n states.

As noted, the [[Byzantine Empire]] continues to exist and is, at least at times, an Anglo-French ally, but is a minor power corresponding to our Greece, its main importance being the control of the strategic [[Dardanelles]]. The [[Osmanlis]] rule a realm beyond it, apparently never having spread beyond [[Anatolia]]. The Kingdoms of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]] never united into a single Spanish realm and were never of much account, and Southern Spain is still predominantly Muslim (one story features a suave Muslim from [[Granada]] residing in London).

Since the Point of Departure which set this alternate history off is the survival of [[Richard the Lion Heart]] until 1219 and his success in eliminating the [[House of Capet|Capetians]] and making himself King of France, presumably in this history [[The Fourth Crusade]] of 1204 which fatally crippled the Byzantine Empire never took place. And with [[John Lackland]] never taking the throne, he never had a chance to behave tyrannically as a king, and therefore there was no rebellion culminating in the [[Magna Carta]]&amp;mdash;which may (very partially) explain the lack of any democratic institutions in this 20th century. (By which Garrett may have meant to imply that the villains of history sometimes have their uses.)

Mexico (Mechicoe in Anglo-French) is still ruled by [[Aztecs]], headed by the Christianised descendants of [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]], having been taken into the empire's high nobility and possessing considerable autonomy. North America (the whole of which is called "New England") is in the process of being settled by Europeans, but the process is far less advanced than in our history, with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes in the 1960s still able to offer significant resistance to whites encroaching on their land. However, there is also mention of thriving tobacco plantations, which seems to indicate that the equivalent of the US South is more thickly settled than the North.  Mention is made of the first European ships reaching the shores of new England in 1569.&lt;ref&gt;"Too Many Magicians"&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is mentioned of "New France" (South America) beyond a single mention of its jungles being a punitive posting to unruly soldiers, from which it is clear that native inhabitants are far from completely subdued there, either.

There are only few references to [[Africa]]. Lord Darcy's father, who was an army "[[Coronel (rank)|coronel]]" (i.e. [[colonel]]), is mentioned as having fought in a war at [[Sudan]] (which might be not exactly the same as our timeline's state of this name). In [[West Africa]], black states are mentioned as maintaining their independence, keeping a balance between the Anglo-French and the Poles, and possessing enough technology to equip modern warships. The impression given is that Africa was not as heavily touched by [[colonialism]] as in our timeline. (Presumably, because the Anglo-French have a whole continent at their disposal on the other side of the Atlantic, and they do their best to bar Polish access.)

==Allusions==
{{Original research|section|date=April 2010}}

===Allusions in the Lord Darcy stories===
As in many of Garrett's other writings, he takes every opportunity to insert subtle, or otherwise, allusions to other fiction &amp;mdash; in these stories there are many echoes of other classic, or otherwise, detectives.  For example, in ''Too Many Magicians'' there is a cameo appearance by the Marquis de London, who looks and talks like [[Nero Wolfe]], an identification reinforced by his sidekick Lord Bontriomphe (whose name is a literal French translation of [[Archie Goodwin (character)|"Goodwin"]]) and his cook Frederique Bruleur (corresponding to Wolfe's cook Fritz Brenner). The title, furthermore, echoes Wolfe novels [[Too Many Cooks (novel)|''Too Many Cooks'']] (1938), ''[[Too Many Women (novel)|Too Many Women]]'' (1947) and ''[[Too Many Clients]]'' (1960).  That novel also contains a number of punning references to ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]''. More subtly, the murder victim, a famous Master Sorcerer named Sir James Zwinge, is named for Randall James Zwinge, better known as the stage magician [[James Randi]]; and the head of the magician's guild is Sir Lyon Gandolphus Gray, whose name is partially a reference to [[Gandalf]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and partially that of [[fantasy]] author [[L. Sprague de Camp|Lyon Sprague de Camp]], and whose appearance as described partakes of both men's appearance.[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/55/Time_and_Chance.jpg]  In the short story "The Bitter End", a bumbling Sergeant-at-Arms is named Cougair Chasseur, a clear reference to [[Inspector Clouseau]] of the [[The Pink Panther|Pink Panther]] movies.  And in several stories there is a secret agent, Sir James le Lein (''le lien'' is French for "bond"; a clear [[James Bond]] reference).

The story "A Case Of Identity" also contains two subtle references to [[contract bridge]], including a magic spell for establishing identity called the [[Jacoby transfer]] which requires blood from "at least two hearts."  This is an allusion to a [[bridge convention]] known as transfer bidding, which attempts to make the stronger, concealed hand the declarer, and always results in a contract of at least Two Hearts.  Also in the story, the murder victim is described as having been struck with a long club, because "according to the [[Kaplan–Sheinwold]] test, a short club cannot have been used."  In the Kaplan–Sheinwold bidding system, making an opening bid of "one club" when holding two or fewer club cards-a "short club"-is not permitted.

The story "The Sixteen Keys" contains a reference to the "von Horst–Shea" process, whereby a person can maintain a lifelong youthful appearance, at the expense of a much shorter life, and a sudden dissolution at the end of it.  This is done by a magical "balancing" of the body's processes, so that no one part of the body wears out before any other.  This is a clear reference to the name of, and events in, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes']] poem, "The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay".

In two stories, Darcy encounters a magical reference to [[E. E. "Doc" Smith]]'s [[Lensman series]]: King's Messengers, couriers who identify themselves with a be-gemmed badge that glows red for its owner, and only its owner. The spell on the badge is said to be invented by magician Sir Edward Elmer in the Thirties, and to have remained secret ever since. "E.E." was short for Edward Elmer, and the badges are a reference to a device which preceded the Lens which gave the Lensmen their name.

Darcy himself resembles Sherlock Holmes in a number of ways.  However, unlike [[Dr. Watson|Watson]], whose primary purpose was to allow Holmes to explain his deductions, Sean O'Lochlainn is more of a counterpart than a foil.  The relationship between the two is very similar to that of the suave, analytical [[Napoleon Solo]] (Darcy) and technical expert [[Illya Kuryakin]] (O'Lochlainn).

Sometime Garrett collaborator [[Michael Kurland]] (who would himself write later Lord Darcy works, with the permission of Garrett's estate) appears as Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Coeur-Terre in ''Too Many Magicians''; and in "A Case of Identity"  the Marquise of Rouen, worried about her missing husband, is described as drinking herself into a stupor on "the best brandy, the St. Courlande-Michele." Similarly several books feature a magical theorist named Sir Thomas Leseaux, a play on another of Garrett's friends, the author and stage magician [[T. A. Waters]].

The strong relation between Lord Darcy and Master Sean O'Lochlainn in some ways recalls that between [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]'s [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] and his servant [[Mervyn Bunter]]. In both cases there is a successful detection team composed of a nobleman and a commoner, with a built-in social hierarchy tempered by a strong and long-lasting personal friendship; in both cases, the commoner partner is an extremely capable and competent person, highly appreciated by his socially-superior noble partner; and in both cases, the partnership started as a wartime relationship between an officer and an NCO, and carried over into civilian life. Garrett's debt to Sayers and Lord Peter Wimsey perhaps strayed over the line in "A Matter Of Gravity" in which the method of murder was essentially a direct copy of the method in Sayers' "Busman's Honeymoon."

The story "The Napoli Express", a mystery taking place on board a socially-prestigious train travelling from London to Naples, is clearly related to the considerable subgenre of works whose plots take place on board the [[Orient Express]].

===Allusions to the Lord Darcy stories in other works===
[[Elizabeth Bear]], whose novel ''New Amsterdam'' is set in a (quite different) alternate timeline where magic works, acknowledged her debt to the Darcy stories by giving her protagonist, a forensic sorceress, the name Abigail Irene Garrett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.elizabethbear.com/newamsterdam.html | publisher = Elizabeth Bear | title = New Amsterdam | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100211160417/http://www.elizabethbear.com/newamsterdam.html | archivedate = 11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[David Weber]]'s [[Honorverse]] novel ''[[Mission of Honor]]'', a character is reading "a novel about the psychically gifted detective Garrett Randall by the highly popular Darcy Lord."

===Similarity with ''Times Without Number''===

Though having a completely different historical origin, Lord Darcy's 20th century has many similarities with that of [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]'s ''[[Times Without Number]]''. In both there is a Catholic Empire based in London and ruling the British Islands, France and the entire Western Hemisphere (with Christianized [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] accepted into its aristocracy). And in both works the Empire depicted is monarchial and conservative, without any trace of democracy, but still relatively benevolent; locked in a decades-long cold war with an Eastern European rival; technologically backward compared to our world, but still possessing a key field of knowledge (magic, time travel) unknown to our 20th century.

==Facts and prior history==
On December 19, 2016, Williams, the Colorado Secretary of State, replaced Michael Baca (no relation to [[Polly Baca]]) as a Colorado presidential elector after he failed to vote for [[Hillary Clinton]] as he was pledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krdo.com/news/top-stories/one-colorado-elector-fails-to-vote-for-clinton/222689519|title=One Colorado elector fails to vote for Clinton, is replaced|first=|last=LAKANA|date=20 December 2016|publisher=KRDO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint claims, "The Constitution does not expressly or implicitly give the states any power to restrict Electors’ freedom beyond the 12th Amendment’s single limitation."&lt;ref name="Docket 01"/&gt;

A similar case, ''[[Baca v. Hickenlooper|Polly Baca and Robert Nemanich v. John W. Hickenlooper Jr.]]'' continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POLLY BACA and ROBERT NEMANICH  v. JOHN W.

Blair]]'' (1952).

== Latest developments and next steps ==
The complaint was amended September 20, 2017.&lt;ref name="Docket 13"/&gt; The parties are discussing a second amended complaint, which may change the name of the case again on October 25, 2017.

[[Image:Pelliotcave2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Paul Pelliot]] examines manuscripts in [[Mogao Caves|cave 17]]]]

The '''''Old Tibetan Chronicle''''' is a collection of narrative accounts and songs relating to Tibet's [[List of emperors of Tibet|Yarlung dynasty]] and the [[Tibetan Empire]]. The three manuscripts that comprise the only extant copies of the Chronicle are among the [[Dunhuang Manuscripts]] found in the early 20th century in the so-called "hidden library" at the [[Mogao Grottoes]] near [[Dunhuang]], which is believed to have been sealed in the 11th century CE. The ''Chronicle'', together with the [[Old Tibetan Annals]] comprise Tibet's earliest extant history.&lt;ref&gt;Dotson (2009), p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
An enormous number of early manuscripts in a variety of languages were collected by [[Aurel Stein]] and [[Paul Pelliot]] at the famous sealed-up Library Cave (no. 17) of the Mogao Grottoes at Dunhuang and sent back to London and Paris respectively. The ''[[Dunhuang manuscripts]]'' in the Tibetan language include the Old Tibetan Chronicle, which was probably compiled in the early 9th century, and the [[Old Tibetan Annals]], which have been described as "the first and single most important documents available on early Tibetan history."&lt;ref&gt;"Forward" by Per Sørensen in (Dotson (2009), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Old Tibetan Chronicle'' is extant in two manuscripts in the [[Paul Pelliot|Pelliot]] Collection at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris, and some manuscript fragments. The main scroll comprises Pelliot tibétain 1286 and Pelliot tibétain 1287. The Tibetan text is written on the blank verso sides of panels pasted together from Chinese scrolls. In the first critical edition of Pelliot tibétain 1286 and Pelliot tibétain 1287, Jacques Bacot and Charles Toussaint considered them to be represent separate texts and referred to Pelliot tibétain 1286 as "Principautés anciennes et généalogie des rois," but following the suggestion of [[Uray Geza|Geza Uray]], both are now considered to be two parts a single original manuscript and can be referred to together as the Old Tibetan Chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): pp.124–5.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, two folios from a single original manuscript, Pelliot tibétain 1144 and IOL Tib J 1375, overlap with narratives found in the Chronicle, though differing in certain details.

== Contents ==
The ''Old Tibetan Chronicle'' is a composite text of various lists, narratives and bardic songs arranged to form a single account of the reigns of the [[List of emperors of Tibet|Tibetan emperors]]. As the list of the Tibetan emperors found in the narrative ends with U Dumten ('U'i dum brtan), later known as [[Langdarma]], the ''Chronicle'' must have been compiled during or soon after the reign of this emperor, that is, in the 840s.&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): 124-5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uray Geza|Geza Uray]] has argued that this composition was made in [[Dunhuang]] itself rather than Central Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chronicle begins with a series of lists - of marriage alliances, principalities, emperors and ministers. The list of emperors is prefaced by an account of the descent of the first emperor [[Nyatri Tsenpo]] (gNya'-khri bTsan-po) from heaven, and ends with an account of the death of [[Drigum Tsenpo]], the first mortal in the line. After this the Chronicle narrates the overthrow of the prince Zingpoje - this narrative is also represented in the fragmentary Version II of the Chronicle. The narrative then continues with an account of the following Tibetan emperors before coming to the reign of [[Songtsen Gampo]] (r. c.605–649). This section actually concentrates on the activities of the minister [[Khyungpo Pungse]]. The Chronicle then continues with a narrative of the following emperors, before coming to [[Trisong Detsen]] (r. 756-c.800), in which his victory over the rival Tibetan king Lig Myi-rhya is celebrated. The Chronicle then returns to the reign of an earlier emperor [[Tridu Songtsen]] (676-704), and his victory over a claim to rule Tibetan by the Gar clan.

The Chronicle does not offer a comprehensive account of the history of Tibet. This is partly because of the nature of its composition from earlier narratives and songs. It has also been argued by [http://www.bibl.u-szeged.hu/~clio/html/ligeti/liglife.htm Lajos Ligeti] and [[Uray Geza|Geza Uray]] that the material in the Chronicle represents the interests of specific Tibetan clans, namely the Dba' and Myang clans (Ligeti adds the Mnon and Tshe-spong clans as well).&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): 136–7&lt;/ref&gt; In this it is comparable to another early Tibetan historical text, the [[Testament of Ba]], which represents the interests of the Dba' clan. Contradicting later Tibetan Buddhist histories, neither the ''Annals'' nor the ''Chronicle'' make any mention of Buddhism in the reign of [[Songtsen Gampo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianart.com/articles/heller2/preface.html "Preface to the Asianart.com edition of this article."] By Amy Heller, Jan 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Chronicle'' does say that, during the reign of king  [[Trisong Detsen]] (Khri srong lde brtsan- ruled from 755 to 797 or 804 CE), "The incomparable religion of the Buddha had been received and there were [[vihara]]s (monasteries) in the centre as well as the borderlands of the country."&lt;ref&gt;Bacot, Thomas and Toussaint (1940-1946), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with chronology==
It has been clear since the Chronicle was first published that there are problems with its chronology. The victory over Lig Myi-rhya is narrated in the section on [[Trisong Detsen]], yet in the victory song and the following narrative the emperor named is [[Songtsen Gampo]], who ruled over a century earlier. Furthermore, the Chronicle ends in the reign of  [[Tridu Songtsen]] (676-704), which should come between [[Songtsen Gampo]] and [[Trisong Detsen]]. There are two main theories regarding this anachronism. Ariane Macdonald and Yoshiro Imaeda have argued that the problems with chronology arose because the Chronicle was composed from a variety of different sources.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald and Imaeda (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uray Geza|Geza Uray]] on the other hand has argued that the scroll of Pelliot tibétain 1287 was cut up and rearranged some time after it was originally written, and the chronological problem results from this. He suggests that this later cutting and pasting may have been done specifically in order to associate the conquest of Lig Myi-rhya with the emperor [[Trisong Detsen]], pointing out that the [[Bonpo]] historical tradition also makes that association.&lt;ref&gt;Uray (1968): 135–6&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''reporting mark''' is an alphabetic code of one to four [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] used to identify owners or lessees of [[rolling stock]] and other equipment used on certain [[railroad]] networks.

In [[North America]] the mark, which consists of an alphabetic code of one to four letters, is stenciled on each piece of equipment, along with a one- to six-digit number. This information is used to uniquely identify every such rail car or locomotive, thus allowing it to be tracked by the railroad they are traveling over, which shares the information with other railroads and customers.

==Standard practices==

===North America===
[[File:Train-connections.jpg|thumb|right|A [[covered hopper]] with [[Shippers Car Line Division|SHPX]] markings]]
The [[Association of American Railroads]] (AAR) assigns marks to all carriers, under authority granted by the [[Surface Transportation Board|U.S. Surface Transportation Board]], [[Canadian Transportation Agency|Transport Canada]], and Mexican Government.

Under current practice&lt;!--not historic practice - see MILW and ROCK for counterexamples--&gt;, the first letter must match the initial letter of the railroad name. As it also acts as a [[Standard Carrier Alpha Code]], the reporting mark cannot conflict with codes in use by other nonrail carriers.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;&lt;ref name=trains/&gt;

Marks ending with the letter "X" are assigned to companies or [[Private railroad car|individuals]] who own railcars, but are not operating railroads; for example, the [[TTX Company]] (formerly Trailer Train Company) is named for its original reporting mark of TTX. In another example, the reporting mark for [[Amtrak California|state-funded]] [[Amtrak]] services in [[California]] is CDTX (whereas the usual Amtrak mark is AMTK) because the state transportation agency ([[Caltrans]]) owns the equipment used in these services. This may also apply to commuter rail, for example [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] in [[Southern California]] uses the reporting mark SCAX because the equipment is owned by the [[Southern California Regional Rail Authority]]—which owns the Metrolink system—even though it is operated by Amtrak. This is why the reporting mark for [[CSX Transportation]], which is an operating railroad, is CSXT instead of CSX. Private (non-common carrier) freight car owners in [[Mexico]] were issued, up until around 1990, reporting marks ending in two X's, possibly to signify that their cars followed different regulations (such as bans on friction bearing trucks) than their American counterparts and so their viability for interchange service was impaired. This often resulted in five-letter reporting marks, an option not otherwise allowed by the AAR.

[[File:RTDX 4001 reporting mark sign seen from RTDX 4004 cab.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.50|A temporary window sign with [[Regional Transportation District|RTDX]] markings]]
Companies owning [[trailer (vehicle)|trailer]]s used in [[trailer-on-flatcar]] service are assigned marks ending with the letter "Z", and the [[National Motor Freight Traffic Association]], which maintains the list of Standard Carrier Alpha Codes, assigns marks ending in U to owners of [[intermodal container]]s.&lt;ref name=register/&gt;&lt;ref name=trains/&gt; The standard [[ISO 6346]] covers identifiers for intermodal containers.

When the owner of a reporting mark is taken over by another company, the old mark becomes the property of the new company. For example, when the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] (mark UP) acquired the [[Chicago and North Western Railway]] (mark CNW) in the 1990s, it retained the CNW mark rather than immediately repaint all acquired equipment. Some companies own several marks that are used to identify different classes of cars, such as boxcars or gondolas.&lt;ref name=trains/&gt;  If the acquiring company discontinues the name or mark of the acquired company, the discontinued mark is referred to as a "fallen flag" railway. Occasionally, long-disused marks are suddenly revived by the companies which now own them. For example, in recent years, the Union Pacific Railroad has begun to use the mark CMO on newly built covered hoppers, gondolas and five-bay coal hoppers. CMO originally belonged to a predecessor of the CNW, which passed it on to them, from which the UP inherited it. Similarly, during the breakup of [[Conrail]], the long-retired marks of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR) and [[New York Central Railroad]] (NYC) were temporarily brought back and applied to much of Conrail's fleet to signify which cars and locomotives were to go to CSX (all cars labeled NYC) and which to Norfolk Southern (all cars labeled PRR). Some of these cars still retain their temporary NYC marks.

==== List of North American reporting marks ====

Because of its size, this list has been split into subpages based on the first letter of the reporting mark.  [[Railinc Corporation|Railinc]], a subsidiary of the AAR, maintains the active reporting marks for the North American rail industry. Railinc offers a free online look-up of reporting marks and other industry reference files through the Railinc's [http://www.railinc.com/irfi Freight Rail 411] website.

[[File:BLS B Jumbo 628 30 Oct 2009.jpg|thumb|right|BLS coach registered in Switzerland (85 = CH)]]

A railway vehicle must be registered in a national vehicle register (NVR) using a 12-digit number derived from the old UIC system of vehicle numbering. The number contains the [[UIC country code|register country]] in the third and fourth digit. The keeper of a vehicle is indicated with a company abbreviation of maximum five letters, called '''Vehicle Keeper Marking''' (VKM) which must be registered with [[Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail|OTIF]] and [[European Union Agency for Railways|ERA]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.era.europa.eu/document-register/pages/list-vkm.aspx ERA site where the monthly updated VKM list can be retrieved]&lt;/ref&gt; and is unique throughout Europe and parts of Asia and Northern Africa. The VKM must not contain special signs or digits.

The VKM is preceded by the code for the country (according to the alphabetical coding system described in Appendix 4 to the 1949 convention and Article 45(4) of the 1968 convention on road traffic), where the vehicle is registered and a hyphen. Some examples:

When a vehicle is sold it will not normally be transferred to another register. The [[České dráhy|Czech railways]] bought large numbers of coaches from ÖBB. The number remained the same but the VKM changed from A-ÖBB to A-ČD.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

=== Europe 1964 to 2005 ===
[[File:20120801Y173a B5063 20-33704-7--Bt5085 80-35951-3 CH-BLS.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.0|BLS coaches, on the left still with owner code 63, on the right with country code 85 and VKM BLS]]
The UIC introduced a uniform numbering system for their members based on a 12-digit number, largely known as ''UIC number''. The third and fourth digit of the number indicated the owner, or more precisely the keeper of the vehicle. Thus each UIC member got a two-digit [[Railway vehicle owner's code|owner code]]. With the introduction of national vehicle registers this code became a country code. Some vehicles had to be renumbered as a consequence. The Swiss company [[BLS Lötschbergbahn]] had the owner code 63. When their vehicles were registered, they got numbers with the country code 85 for Switzerland and the VKM BLS. Example for an "Einheitswagen" delivered in 1957:
* delivered as BLS B 831

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, prior to nationalisation, wagons owned by the major railways were marked with codes of two to four letters, these codes normally being the initials of the railway concerned; for example, wagons of the [[Great Western Railway]] were marked "G W"; those of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] were marked "L M S", etc. The codes were agreed between the railways and registered with the [[Railway Clearing House]].

In '''''S v D''''', an important case in South African criminal law, the appellant had attempted to rape an eleven-year-old girl. He was a 44-year-old first offender. The complainant had not suffered physical injuries; there was no evidence of psychological damage. The sentence was altered on appeal to three years' imprisonment, half suspended.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1840">The '''Schulze Registers''' are the only surviving record of clandestine marriages in [[Ireland]].

Canon law in the 18th and 19th centuries in Ireland stipulated that [[banns]] should be called or a [[marriage licence]] obtained before a marriage could take place and that the marriage should be celebrated in the parish where at least one of the parties was resident. Also, the marriage had to be celebrated by a clergyman of one of the religious denominations then in Ireland.

Some clergymen were willing, for a fee, to marry couples in secret, in "irregular" or "clandestine" marriages. This might have been necessary for a number of reasons, for example, objections of parents, problems with religious affiliation, or financial difficulty. While most of these "couple-beggars" did not keep a record of the marriages, some did—among them J.G.F. Schulze (died February 1839), minister of the Lutheran Church in Poolbeg Street, [[Dublin]].  He was licensed to act only in his own congregation, but is known to have married couples of all sects, recording over 6,000 marriages between 1806 and 1837. Two of his registers of marriage survive, and are held by the [[Register office#Ireland|General Register Office of Births, Deaths and Marriages]] in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groireland.ie/history3.htm General Register Office, Dublin]&lt;/ref&gt;
The marriages performed by Schulze, over 6000, have also been indexed in a book 'Irregular Marriages in Dublin before 1837' by Henry (Harry) McDowell (2015).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5665">'''Scottish Screen''' was the [[Scottish public bodies|national body]] for [[film]] and [[television]] in [[Scotland]], established in April 1997. It took on the functions of the [[Scottish Film Council]], the Scottish Film Production Fund, Scottish Screen Locations and Scottish Broadcast and Film Training, forming a unitary organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2002/12/16016/15724|title=Scottish Screen a Review by the Scottish Executive|last=|first=|date=2002-12-19|website=www.scotland.gov.uk|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Scottish Screen worked in the areas of production, development, location assistance, exhibition and festivals, training, media education and preserving the heritage and history of the moving image; developing, encouraging and promoting every aspect of film, television and new media in Scotland. Working with the [[Scottish Government]], their goal was to establish Scotland as a major screen production centre and project [[Scottish culture]] to the world.

It was announced in January 2006 that Scottish Screen would amalgamate with [[Scottish Arts Council]] to form the newly created [[Creative Scotland]]. Creative Scotland took over these functions in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10462456|title=New body aims to boost the arts|date=2010-07-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film collection of Scottish Screen, originally known as Scottish Screen Archive and established in 1976, and was previously a department of Scottish Screen. In 2007 the Scottish Screen Archive became part of the collection of the [[National Library of Scotland]], and in 2015 was renamed as the Library's Moving Image Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nls.uk/collections/moving-image-archive/history|title=History - Moving Image Archive|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moving Image Archive==
The main purpose of the National Library of Scotland's Moving Image Archive is to locate, preserve and provide access to moving images reflecting Scottish 20th and 21st century culture and history. In addition the Archive collects a wide range of written and photographic materials relating to the development of cinema exhibition and film production in Scotland over the past 100 years. The Archive was originally premised in [[Hillington, Scotland|Hillington]] with limited facilities, however it relocated in 2016 to the Library's new public centre for digital and moving image collections at Glasgow's [[Kelvin Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nls.uk/using-the-library/kelvin-hall|title=Kelvin Hall|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Principally non-fiction, the Archive's collection to date includes more than 46,000 items&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nls.uk/collections/moving-image-archive|title=Moving Image Archive - Collections - National Library of Scotland|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising documentary, newsreel, shorts, educational, advertising and promotional films, amateur and professional productions. The material is largely on 16mm and 35mm, with smaller collections of 9.5mm and 8mm film and videotape. The collection has been built up largely through donations from all sectors of the community, industry, broadcasting organisations, local authorities and members of the public, with a nucleus of material acquired from the former Scottish Central Film Library and Films of Scotland Committee.

The strengths of the collection lie in its ability to illustrate local community life, industrial history and the changing nature of leisure. It reflects ways in which Scotland and its people have been portrayed in film since 1896, both by indigenous and visiting filmmakers and more recently the broadcasting sector and the [[Scottish film industry]].

The television material in the Archive includes [[Gaelic-language]] broadcast production from 1993 onwards, the acquisition of which is funded by [[MG Alba|Seirbheis nam Meadhanan Gaidhlig]] (GMS).

Preservation is the primary function of the Archive. Purpose built film and video vaults ensure that original masters are correctly stored and protected.

The Archive is a member of [[The International Federation of Film Archives]] (FIAF), the International Federation of Television Archives (FIAT), and is a founding member of the UK [[Film Archive Forum]]. The Archive is also a participating member of the [[Scottish Archive Network]] (SCAN).

The '''''Siku Quanshu''''', variously translated as the ''Complete Library in Four Sections'', ''Imperial Collection of Four'', ''Emperor's Four Treasuries'', ''Complete Library in Four Branches of Literature'', or ''Complete Library of the Four Treasuries'', is the largest collection of books in [[Chinese history]]. The complete encyclopedia contains an annotated catalogue of 10,680 titles along with a compendiums of 3,593 titles.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15133087|title=The emperor's four treasuries : scholars and the state in the late Chʻien-lung era|last=1948-|first=Guy, R. Kent,|date=1987|publisher=Council on East Asian Studies, Harvard University|isbn=0674251156|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=15133087}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Siku Quanshu'' ended up surpassing the [[Ming dynasty]]'s 1403 ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]'' in size, which was China's largest encyclopedia prior to the creation of the Siku Quanshu.

==History==

=== Creation ===
Late in the 18th Century, [[Qing dynasty]] set about a momentous task, the creation of the ''Siku Quanshu''. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] ordered the creation of the ''Siku Quanshu'' in 1772. Local and Provincial officers were in charge of locating and collecting important books. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] encouraged owners of rare or valuable books to send them to the capital, however few actually did due to concerns about the [[Literary Inquisition]]. Towards the end of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained [[Anti-Qing sentiment|anti-Manchu sentiment]]. Less than three months after the issue of this decree, four to five thousand books were handed in.

By March 1773, an editorial board (composed of hundreds of editors, collators, and copyists) was created in [[Beijing]] to gather and review books brought to them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This board included over 361 scholars, with [[Ji Yun]] and Lu Xixiong (陸錫熊) as chief editors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There was around 3,826 scribes who copied every word by hand. These copyists were not paid in [[Qing dynasty coinage|coinage]] but in government positions after they had transcribed a set amount of the encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42772193|title=Chinese history : a manual|last=Porter.|first=Wilkinson, Endymion|date=2000|publisher=Published by the Harvard University Asia Center for the Harvard-Yenching Institute|isbn=0674002474|edition=Rev. and enl|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=42772193}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took over a decade until the encyclopedia was completed and all seven copies were distributed.

=== Distribution ===
The [[Qianlong Emperor]] commissioned seven copies of the ''Siku Quanshu'' to be made. The first four copies were for the Emperor and were kept in the north. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] constructed special libraries for them. They were located in the [[Forbidden City]], [[Old Summer Palace]], [[Shenyang]], and [[Chengde]]. The remaining three copies were sent to the south. They were deposited into libraries within the cities of [[Hangzhou]], [[Zhenjiang]], and [[Yangzhou]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hung|first=William|date=1939|title=Preface to an Index to Ssu-k'u ch'uan-shu tsung-mu and Wei-shou shu-mu|jstor=2717904|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=4|issue=1|pages=47–58|doi=10.2307/2717904}}&lt;/ref&gt; All seven libraries also received copies of the 1725 imperial encyclopedia ''[[Gujin tushu jicheng]]''.

The copy kept in the [[Old Summer Palace]] was destroyed during the [[Second Opium War]] in 1860. During the fight against the English and the French, the [[Old Summer Palace]] copy was burned. The two copies kept in [[Zhenjiang|Zhenjang]] and [[Yangzhou]] were completely destroyed while the copy kept in [[Hangzhou]] was only about 70 to 80 percent destroyed, during the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. The four remaining copies suffered some damage during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Today, those copies can be located in the [[National Library of China]] in Beijing, the [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei, the Gansu Library in [[Lanzhou]], and the Zhejiang Library in [[Hangzhou]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Censorship===
The [[Qianlong Emperor]] did not make good on his promises to return the books. Any books that did not make it into the ''Siku Quanshu'' risked becoming part of the ''Siku Jinshu (Chinese: 四库禁书).'' The ''Siku Jinshu'' is a catalogue of over 2,855 books that were rejected and banned during the completion of the ''Siku Quanshu''. An additional four to five hundred other books were edited and censored. A majority of the books that were banned were written towards the end of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Dynasty]] and contained [[Anti-Qing sentiment|anti-Manchu sentiment]]. The ''Siku Jinshu'' was the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s attempt to rid the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]] of any [[Ming Loyalists]] by executing scholars and burned any books that gave direct or implied political attacks against the [[Manchu people|Manchu]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Contents==
[[Image:Siku 1.png|thumb|200px|A page from the ''Siku Quanshu''.]]Each copy of the ''Siku Quanshu'' was bound into 36,381 volumes (册), with more than 79,000 chapters (卷). In total, each copy is around 2.3 million pages, and has approximately 800 million [[Chinese character]]s.

=== Complete Catalogue  ===
The scholars working on the ''Siku Quanshu'' wrote a descriptive note for each book which detailed the author's name along with their place and year of birth. Next, after they determined what parts of the author's work would go into the compilation, they would analyzed the main points of the author's argument. This short annotation, which reflected their own opinion, would be put in the beginning of the ''Siku Quanshu'' and formed the Complete Catalogue. The Complete Catalogue was divided into four sections or ''kù'' ([[Wikt:庫|库]]; translated to "warehouse; storehouse; treasury; repository"), in reference to the imperial library divisions. The name, Siku Quanshu, is a reference to these four sections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These four sections are:
*''Jīng'' ([[Wikt:經|经]] "Classics") [[Chinese classic texts]]
*''Shǐ'' ([[Wikt:史|史]] "Histories") histories and geographies from [[Chinese history]]
*''Zĭ'' ([[Wikt:子|子]] "Masters") philosophy, arts, sciences from [[Chinese philosophy]]
*''Jí'' ([[Wikt:集|集]] "Collections") anthologies from [[Chinese literature]]

=== 44 Sub-Categories ===
The books are then divided into 44 sub-categories, or ''lèi'' ({{zh|t={{linktext|類}}|s={{linktext|类}}|links=no}}). The ''Siku Quanshu'' collection includes most major Chinese texts, from the ancient [[Zhou Dynasty]] to the Qing Dynasty, covering all domains of [[academia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It also lacks any Western or Japanese texts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Included within these 44 sub-categories are: the ''[[Analects of Confucius]]'', ''[[Mencius]]'', ''[[Great Learning]]'', ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'', ''[[I Ching]]'', ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'', ''[[Classic of Rites]]'', ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', ''[[The Art of War]]'', ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'', ''[[Stratagems of the Warring States]]'', ''[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]'', and other classics.

===Authors in the Siku Quanshu===
Two of [[Zhao Yiguang]]'s works are housed in the [[Wang Qishu]], they were the ''[[Jiuhuan Shitu]]'' (九圜史圖)  and the ''[[Liuhe Mantu]]'' (六匌曼圖). They were part of the [[Siku Quanshu Cunmu Congshu]] (四庫全書存目叢書).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |accessdate=14 December 2011|quote=Jiangsu Governor Wang qishu Li Shouqian na Zhejiang Governor 董說 Ming 明 Zhu Zhongfu 朱仲福 Ming 明 Wei Rui 魏濬 Ming 明 Ke Zhongjung 柯仲炯 Ming 明 Zhao Yiguang 趙宧光 Ming 明 Xu Xuchen 許胥臣 Ming 明 Dong Yue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SqOQXfn6OAC&amp;pg=PT356&amp;dq=Zhongfu+%E6%9C%B1%E4%BB%B2%E7%A6%8F+Ming+%E6%98%8E+Wei+Rui+%E9%AD%8F%E6%BF%AC+Ming+%E6%98%8E+Ke+Zhongjung+%E6%9F%AF%E4%BB%B2%E7%82%AF+Ming+%E6%98%8E+Zhao+Yiguang+%E8%B6%99%E5%AE%A7%E5%85%89+Ming+%E6%98%8E+Xu+Xuchen+%E8%A8%B1%E8%83%A5&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A_sVT-jBEubY0QG544jyBg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Zhongfu%20%E6%9C%B1%E4%BB%B2%E7%A6%8F%20Ming%20%E6%98%8E%20Wei%20Rui%20%E9%AD%8F%E6%BF%AC%20Ming%20%E6%98%8E%20Ke%20Zhongjung%20%E6%9F%AF%E4%BB%B2%E7%82%AF%20Ming%20%E6%98%8E%20Zhao%20Yiguang%20%E8%B6%99%E5%AE%A7%E5%85%89%20Ming%20%E6%98%8E%20Xu%20Xuchen%20%E8%A8%B1%E8%83%A5&amp;f=false|title=Looking at it from Asia: the processes that shaped the sources of history of science|author=Florence Bretelle-Establet|editor=Florence Bretelle-Establet|edition=illustrated|volume=Volume 265 of Boston studies in the philosophy of science|series=|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=90-481-3675-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics''''' (2018), 3rd ed., is an twenty-volume reference work on [[economics]] published by [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. It contains around 3,000 entries, including many classic essays from the original Inglis Palgrave Dictionary, and a significant increase in new entries from the previous editions by the  most prominent economists in the field, among them 36 winners of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Durlauf | first1 = Steven N. | last2 = Blume | first2 = Lawrence E. | author-link1 = Steven N.

The first edition was titled ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'' (1987), was idealized and edited by  [[John Eatwell]], [[Murray Milgate]], and [[Peter Kenneth Newman|Peter Newman]], as a way of recovering the legacy of Inglis Palgrave famous dictionary. It was published in four volumes, while the second edition was under the direction of [[Steven N. Durlauf]] and [[Lawrence E.

==''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'' ==
'''''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics''''' (1987) is the title of the first ''New Palgrave'' edition.  It is a four-volume reference edited by [[John Eatwell, Baron Eatwell|John Eatwell]], [[Murray Milgate]], and [[Peter Kenneth Newman|Peter Newman]]. It has 4,000 pages of entries, including 1,300 subject entries (with 4,000 cross-references), and 655 biographies. There were 927 contributors, including 13 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Laureates in Economics]]  at the time of first publication. It includes about 50 articles from ''Palgrave's Dictionary of Political Economy'' (1925–1927).&lt;ref name="NewPalgrave1987"/&gt; It was roughly twice the length of its predecessor and differed further in excluding most subjects not on economics or closely related  to its practice.{{sfnp|Stigler|1988}} It was developed as a modern version of the old Inglis Palgrave dictionary, with entries written by prominent economists for a highly specialized public.

=== Reviews ===
====General remarks====
Reviewing the 1987 edition for the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Robert M. Solow]] concluded that "this is a dictionary only in a very special sense. There are excellent survey articles, in various sizes, on various subjects. But the best of them are written by professionals for professionals." According to Solow, graduate students in economics would find the dictionary useful, but most of the articles would be inaccessible to non-economists, even undergraduate students of the liberal arts. For economists, however, the dictionary provided many excellent overviews of contemporary research.&lt;ref name="Solow"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/20/books/the-wide-wide-world-of-wealth.html?pagewanted=3&amp;src=pm Robert M. Solow, ''New York Times'' "The Wide, Wide World of Wealth", March 28, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; In response, editor {{harvtxt|Milgate|1992}} confirmed that the articles were written for an audience of  [[professional]] economists, and so neither for the general [[reading public]] nor for [[Expert|specialist]] economists.

====Mathematics and contemporary economics ====
According to Milgate, ''New Palgrave'' downplayed mathematics, in comparison to leading economic journals. Only 24% of the columns ''contained'' "any mathematics" (and so required expensive hand-typesetting), while only 25% of the most recent issue of the ''[[American Economic Review]]'' (''AER'') in fact ''lacked'' mathematics, according to Milgate, who averred that  the ''AER''{{'s}} mathematical usage was typical of leading contemporary journals: The ''New Palgrave''{{'}}s usage of mathematics was the reciprocal of the contemporary profession's. {{harv|Milgate|1992|p=299}} "It must be concluded that the ''New Palgrave'' actually under-represented the mathematical element in modern economics; and under-represented it to a significant degree", wrote {{harvtxt|Milgate|1992|p=300}}.

Commenting on contemporary economics, Solow described technical economics as its essential "[[infrastructure]]": 

{{quote|There is a lesson in the fate of ''Palgrave.'' Economics is no longer a fit conversation piece for ladies and gentlemen. It has become a technical subject. Like any technical subject it attracts some people who are more interested in the technique than the subject. That is too bad, but it may be inevitable. In any case, do not kid yourself: the technical core of economics is indispensable infrastructure for the political economy. That is why, if you consult ''Palgrave'' looking for enlightenment about the world today, you will be led to technical economics, or history, or nothing at all.&lt;ref name="Solow"/&gt;}}

More advanced mathematics was implicit in some of the articles, many of which were well written and reasonably accessible. Solow recommended the "broad and deep" article on [[game theory]] by [[Robert J. Aumann]] for well-equipped graduate students, along with [[John Harsanyi]]'s article on [[bargaining theory]]. The articles on [[financial economics]] were "written by the best people—[[Stephen Ross (economist)|Stephen Ross]], [[Robert C. Merton|Robert Merton]], and others—and they show it"; however, they were too difficult for the average investor.  Complimenting the article on [[international trade]]&lt;!--  by John S. Chipman --&gt;, Solow added a ''[[caveat lector]]'': "But God forbid that" a reader without knowledge of economics should try to understand [[protectionism]], by consulting the ''New Palgrave''.&lt;ref name="Solow"/&gt;

In his review, [[George Stigler]] commended the dictionary's non-technical and conceptually rich article on [[social choice]], which was written by [[Kenneth Arrow]], among "numerous" excellent articles. However, Stigler criticized the inclusion of "dozens" of articles in [[mathematical economics]], which failed to provide intuitive introductions to the problem, how it was solved, and what the solution is: "These articles were written, not for a tolerably competent economist, but exclusively for fellow specialists."&lt;ref name="Stigler1732" &gt;{{harvp|Stigler|1988|p=1732}}&lt;!-- this cite reroutes within the article--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exclusion of empirical material====
Whitaker wrote, "Readers to whom economics is nothing if not a science based on empirical inquiry may be dismayed by the lack of attention to empirical studies and factual matters".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|

Stigler criticized the ''New Palgrave'' for largely ignoring empirical economics—economic data, summary statistics, and econometric investigations. According to Stigler, the empirical investigation of consumption and production functions has profoundly influenced microeconomic theory, while the empirical investigation of price levels has profoundly influenced monetary economics: The ''New Palgrave'''s neglect of empirical economics also weakened its treatment of economic theory and the history of economic thought. Furthermore, the editors failed to explain their neglect of empirical economics, while they gave large space to treatments of "technical economics", especially [[mathematical economics]], and faddish topics, wrote Stigler.&lt;ref name="Stigler1731"&gt;{{harvp|Stigler|1988|p=1731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The article on 'Profit and profit theory' does not contain a single number for what profits are or ever have been, in the United States or any other country, or any reference to any source that might provide such a number", wrote [[Herbert Stein]], who complained "There are articles about elasticities of this or that but no estimate of the elasticity of anything."&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Herbert, 1988. "The state of economics", ''The AEI Economist'', January, pp. 1–7, as cited by {{harvp|Milgate|1992|p=291}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the critics of the over-emphasis on theoretical and "doctrinal" economics, editor Milgate admitted that the  ''New Palgrave'' was flawed by its neglect of empirical economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Milgate|1992|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms of undue weight for heterodox approaches====
[[Robert M. Solow]] criticized the 1987 edition for slighting  [[mainstream economics]] by giving excessive space to  the "dissenting fringes within academic economics", namely [[Marxist economics]] as well as [[Austrian economics|"Austrian persuasion"]], [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesians]], and [[neo-Ricardianism|neo-Ricardian]].&lt;ref name="Solow"/&gt;
{{quote|Nevertheless, there is usually a definite consensus—there is one now—and an accurate picture of the discipline would make that clear. It would have to give dissent a fair shake. It would have to treat mainstream ideas critically. But it should keep the various "paradigms" in proportion. I do not think ''The New Palgrave'' has managed to do that.
&lt;p&gt;
The most obvious, though not the most important, manifestation of imbalance is the large number of items devoted to Marxist themes, from "abstract and concrete labor" to "vulgar economy." Some of the articles are informative, some are mystifying; but that is not the point. Marx was an important and influential thinker, and Marxism has been a doctrine with intellectual and practical influence. The fact is, however, that most serious English-speaking economists regard Marxist economics as an irrelevant dead end. ''The New Palgrave'' does not take up the issue head on, but I think it gives a false impression of the state of play by this deadpan statement. It is rather as if a medical dictionary were to intersperse articles on mainstream orthopedics, written by orthopedists, with articles on osteopathy, written by osteopaths, and were to leave it at that.&lt;ref name="Solow"/&gt;}}
The 1987 dictionary's discussion of [[heterodox economics|heterodox approaches]] was also criticized by George Stigler, who complained that these articles were written by sympathetic editors in a partisan manner:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The selection of sympathetic writers ... is in fact a general practice in ''Palgrave&amp;nbsp;II''. Israel Kirzner's essay on the Austrian economists does not hint at the existence of error, misrepresentation of critics, or tasteless attacks upon the German&amp;nbsp;Historical&amp;nbsp;School, and Klaus&amp;nbsp;Henning did little better with Böhm-Bawerk. An ersatz Austrian
is apparently more loyal than the genuine article.&lt;ref name="Stigler1732"/&gt;
[Italics added]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Stigler complained about the extensive and biased articles on Marxist economics, including "[[neo-Ricardianism|neo-Ricardian]]" economists (who follow [[Piero Sraffa]]): "A nonprofessional reader would never guess from these volumes that economists working in the Marxian-Sraffian tradition represent a small minority of modern economists, and that their writings have virtually no impact upon the professional work of most economists in major English-language universities." Stigler provided a table of articles that were biased by Marxist orthodoxy and criticized some authors by name, especially a "violently pro-Marxist" entry by [[C. B. Macpherson]].&lt;ref name="Stigler1732"/&gt;

== The 2nd edition (2008) ==
The General Editors were [[Steven N. Durlauf]] and [[Lawrence E. Blume|Lawrence E. Blume.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Who's who in economics|last1=Blaug|first1=Mark|last2=Sturges|first2=Rodney P.|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=1999|isbn=9781858988863|location=Cheltenham, UK Northampton, MA|author-link1=Mark Blaug}}&lt;/ref&gt; It added considerably on the previous edition, and maintained the general conception of the dictionary as written for advanced specialists. The list of Nobel laureates increased to 25, and the number of volumes also doubled. Perhaps as a result of already being an established institution there were a considerably smaller number of reviews.  Declan Trott argued that the Dictionary is not properly a dictionary or an encyclopedia and that the quality and depth of the entries are very uneven, comparing it with Wikipedia as a source for information on economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trott|first=Declan|date=2008|title=Reviewed Work: The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics Online by Steven N. Durlauf, Lawrence E. Blume|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43199543|journal=Agenda - A Journal of Policy Analysis and Reform|volume=15|issue=4|pages=61-64|doi=|issn=1322-1833|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier editions ==
[[Inglis Palgrave|R. H. Inglis Palgrave]]'s ''Dictionary of Political Economy'' (1894–1899), 3 v., was the forerunner of ''The New Palgrave''.  The initial contractual agreement between Palgrave and the publisher Macmillan &amp; Co. is dated 1888. Serial installments in 1891–92 had disappointing sales. An appendix was added to [https://books.google.com/books?id=rhsNAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Volume III] in 1908, so completing publication of the set.  The ''Dictionary'' was wide-ranging and sometimes idiosyncratic. It included for example a comprehensive treatment of laws on property and commercial transactions.  Professional reaction has been described as generally favorable and unsurprising, "given that almost all economists of any repute had already endorsed the enterprise by agreeing to contribute."{{sfnp|Stigler|1988}}  Nearly thirty years after the first volume appeared, ''Palgrave's Dictionary of Political Economy'' (1923–1926), edited by [[Henry Higgs]], appeared with Palgrave's name added to the title but few changes in structure or contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = "Palgrave" | title = The New Palgrave: a dictionary of economics | editor-last1 = Eatwell | editor-first1 = John | editor-last2 = Milgate | editor-first2 = Murray  | editor-last3 = Newman | editor-first3 = Peter K. | editor-link1 = John Eatwell, Baron Eatwell | editor-link2 = Murray Milgate | editor-link3 = Peter Kenneth Newman | pages = 791–92 | publisher = Macmillan Stockton Press Maruzen | location = London New York Tokyo | year = 1987 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780333740408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Way To Cook''''' (1989, [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]]) is a cookbook and series of instructional videos written by the television personality and cooking teacher [[Julia Child]]; Child saw it as her [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] and considered it the culmination of her career as a cooking teacher. The book was published by Knopf, the firm that published almost all of Child's work from the beginning to the end of her career. The video series was produced with and marketed by the [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] Educational Foundation in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] but was shot at Child's home in [[Santa Barbara, California]].

''The Way To Cook'' differs from ''[[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]]'' in numerous ways. While ''Mastering'' was a collaboration that co-authors [[Simone Beck]] and Louisette Bertholle had gotten underway before Child's involvement, ''The Way To Cook'' was a solo work written entirely by Child during the late 1980s. Another difference was that ''The Way To Cook'' did not focus entirely on French cuisine, on which her reputation had been built, but added a substantial number of recipes for traditional American dishes, especially those of New England, where Child's mother had come from and where Child had spent much of her life. In this, the book reflected the diversification of the cooking repertoire on Child's television show, ''Julia Child &amp; Company,'' that had taken place since its  premiere in 1978.

The book also formally described an approach to teaching that Child and others had been using since the very beginning, providing a more explicit focus on "master recipes"—that is, recipes that illustrate broad principles in cooking—with other recipes provided as variations on those same themes. The book also made greater use of improved cookware designs and of new technology such as the [[food processor]], of which Child was a major proponent. The 1983 revision of ''Mastering'' was inspired in large part  by the introduction of the food processor into the market.

The book immediately proved to be extremely popular, with four printings in the first month after its introduction;&lt;ref&gt;Masthead of [[:Image:Waytocook.jpg|a copy from the fourth printing]], dated November 1989&lt;/ref&gt; it remains in print nearly two decades later, in both hardcover and softcover editions. In December 2009, the videos, originally available only as a set of six videotapes, were re-released as a set of two DVDs.

'''''Titchener v British Railway Board''''' [1983] 1 WLR 1427 is a Scottish [[Scottish delict|delict]] case concerning [[occupiers' liability (Scots law)|occupiers' liability]], decided by the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarb.co.uk/lisc/Neglg19801984.php|title=Negligence - 1980- 1984 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Miss Titchener, a 15-year-old girl, climbed through a gap in a fence onto a railway line owned by the [[British Railways Board]]. She was hit by a train. She sued the board under the [[Occupiers' Liability (Scotland) Act 1960]] for failing in their common duty of care to keep the premises reasonably safe for visitors.

The [[Inner House of the Court of Session]] held that the pursuer had taken a chance, fully aware of the risks involved and that the Board had no responsibility to maintain the fence any more than they had.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lunney, Ken Oliphant, ''Tort Law: Text and Materials'' (OUP, 2008) 286, {{ISBN|9780199211364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
The House of Lords dismissed the claimant's final appeal, holding that she was not owed any duty under the Occupiers' Liability (Scotland) Act 1960 on the grounds that she had voluntarily decided to run the risk of walking on the railway line. As such, the defender had no duty, at least in relation to the pursuer, to maintain the fence any better than they had, based on the principle of ''[[volenti non fit injuria]]''.

==Other cases==
The following cases were referred to in this judgment:

* ''[[Slater v Clay Cross Co Ltd]]''—distinguished

The '''Whitney Museum of American Art original building''' is a collection of three 1838 [[rowhouse]]s located at 8-12 West [[8th Street (Manhattan)|8th Street]] between [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[MacDougal Street]] in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].  In 1907, [[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney]] established the ''Whitney Studio Gallery'' at 8 West 8th Street adjacent to her own MacDougal Alley studio. This, and the later ''Whitney Studio Club'' at 147 West 4th Street, were intended to provide young artists with places to  meet and exhibit their works.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;&lt;ref name=Whitney1937&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitney Museum of American Art|title=Whitney Museum of American Art: history, purpose and activities, with a complete list of works in its permanent collection to June, 1937|date=1937|publisher=Whitney Museum of American Art|location=New York|page=3|url=https://archive.org/details/whitneymuseumofa00whit|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ArtStory&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolf|first1=Justin|title=The Whitney Museum of American Art|url=http://www.theartstory.org/museum-whitney.htm|website=The Art Story|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, American artist and friend [[Robert Winthrop Chanler]] was commissioned to redesign the interior of the 8th street property, adding an allegorical bas-relief ceiling, a 20-foot-high plaster and bronze fireplace, elaborate stained glass windows and decorative screens.&lt;ref name=NatTreasure/&gt;&lt;ref name=CeilingACL&gt;{{cite web|title=Whitney Studio Ceiling|url=http://www.conlab.org/acl/whitney/sitehist.html|website=Architectural Conservation Laboratory (ACL) of the University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ConservationPlan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matero|first1=Frank|last2=Drapala|first2=Lauren|title=THE WHITNEY STUDIO CEILING: Examination, Analysis and Recommendation for Conservation|url=http://www.conlab.org/acl/whitney/images/WHIT_Report_Final.pdf|website=Architectural Conservation Laboratory|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, when the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] rejected Whitney's offer of the gift of nearly 500 new artworks that she had collected, Whitney established the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref name=WomenHistory&gt;{{cite news|title=29: New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/pwwmh/ny29.htm|accessdate=4 February 2015|work=Places where women made history|agency=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 she had architect Auguste L. Noel of the firm of Noel &amp; Miller convert the three row houses at 8-12 West 8th Street into a gallery and residence for herself, and the museum's first home.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;&lt;ref name=desrep /&gt;

In the 1940s, there were unrealized plans to incorporate the collections of the Whitney into the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] as part of the 75th anniversary celebration of the Met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Met_Museum_75th_Anniversary_Committee_records_b18084369.pdf "Finding aid for the Metropolitan Museum of Art 75th Anniversary Committee records, 1945-1950"], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, the museum moved uptown to new quarters on 54th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues &amp;ndash; eventually settling in 1966 at 945 [[Madison Avenue (Manhattan)|Madison Avenue]] at [[75th Street (Manhattan)|East 75th Street]] &amp;ndash; and the building, with the addition of #14 West 8th Street, an [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] house built in 1853-54,&lt;ref name=desrep /&gt; became the [[New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture]].&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt;

The building is located within the [[Greenwich Village Historic District]], established in 1969 by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]], and was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NatTreasure&gt;{{cite web|title=A National Treasure, the Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney Studio|url=http://www.seniorwomen.com/news/index.php/whitney-studio-national-treasure|accessdate=4 February 2015|website=Senior Women Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Historic Landmark Nomination: Whitney Museum of American Art / New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture|url={{NHLS url|id=92001877}} |format=pdf|author=Avis Berman|date=December 2, 1991|publisher=National Park Service}} and

The '''Yugoslav National Movement''' ({{lang-sh|Jugoslavenski narodni pokret / Југословенски народни покрет}}), also known as the '''United Militant Labour Organization''' (''Združena borbena organizacija rada'' / ''Здружена борбена организација рада'', or '''Zbor''' / ''Збор''&lt;ref&gt;''Note:'' ''zbor'' literally means "[[corps]]" or "[[National Assembly|assembly]]"&lt;/ref&gt;), was a Yugoslav authoritarian  movement led by politician [[Dimitrije Ljotić]]. Founded in 1935, it received considerable German financial and political assistance during the [[interwar period]] and participated in the [[Yugoslavian parliamentary election, 1935|1935]] and [[Yugoslavian parliamentary election, 1938|1938]] Yugoslav parliamentary elections, in which it never received more than 1 percent of the popular vote.

Following the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] and occupation of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Germans selected several Zbor members to join the Serbian [[puppet government]] of [[Milan Nedić]]. The [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] (SDK) was established as Zbor's party army. Ljotić had no control over the SDK, which was commanded by Colonel [[Kosta Mušicki]]. In late 1944, Ljotić and his followers retreated to Slovenia with the Germans and other collaborationist formations. In March, Ljotić and [[Chetnik]] leader [[Draža Mihailović]] agreed on a last-ditch alliance against the [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. Ljotić's followers were placed under the command of Chetnik commander [[Miodrag Damjanović]]. Ljotić was killed in an automobile accident in late April 1945. His followers later fled to Italy alongside the Chetniks. The [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] extradited many back to Yugoslavia following the war, where they were summarily executed and buried in mass graves. Those who were not extradited immigrated to western countries and established émigré organizations intended to promote Zbor's political agenda.

==Background==
[[Dimitrije Ljotić]] was a right-wing politician in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] during the [[interwar period]]. On 16 February 1931, he was appointed to the position of Yugoslav [[Ministry of Justice (Yugoslavia)|Minister of Justice]] by King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]] as a result of his unwavering loyalty to the [[Karađorđević dynasty]].{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=14}} In June of that year, Ljotić suggested to Alexander that the Yugoslav political system be structured on the Italian fascist model.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=101}} He presented him with a draft constitution that proposed "an organic constitutional hereditary monarchy, undemocratic and non-parliamentary, based on the mobilization of popular forces, gathered around economic, professional, cultural and charity organizations, that would be politically accountable to the king."{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=297}} The king rejected Ljotić's constitution as being too [[authoritarian]].{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=197}} On 17 August, Ljotić resigned from his post after the government decided to create a single government-backed political party in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=14}}

==Formation==
In 1934, Alexander was assassinated in [[Marseille]].{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=297}} That year, Ljotić made contact with three pro-fascist movements and the publishers of their respective newspapers—''Otadžbina'' (Fatherland), published in Belgrade; the monthly ''Zbor'' (Rally), published in [[Herzegovina]]; and the weekly ''Buđenje'' (Awakening), published in Petrovgrad (modern [[Zrenjanin]]). Ljotić contributed to all three publications and became most influential with the ''Otadžbina'' movement.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=14}} He subsequently founded the Yugoslav National Movement ({{lang-sh|Jugoslovenski narodni pokret}}), which was also known as the United Active Labour Organization (''Združena borbena organizacija rada'', or Zbor).{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=297}} Zbor was created by the merger of three fascist movements—[[Yugoslav Action]], the "[[Association of Fighters of Yugoslavia|Fighters]]" from [[Ljubljana]], and ''Buđenje'' from Petrovgrad. It was officially established in Belgrade on 6 January 1935, the sixth anniversary of [[6 January Dictatorship|King Alexander's dictatorship proclamation]]. Its members elected Ljotić its president, [[Juraj Korenić]] its vice-president, [[Fran Kandare]] as second vice-president and [[Velibor Jonić]] as its secretary-general.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|pp=14–15}} Ljotić was chosen because of his previous stint as Minister of Justice and because of his connections with the royal court.{{sfn|Kranjc|2013|p=39}}

Zbor's official stated goal was the imposition of a planned economy and "the racial and biological defense of the national life-force and the family". ''Otadžbina'' became its official newspaper.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|pp=14–15}} The party was declared illegal upon establishment, since virtually all political parties in Yugoslavia had been banned since the declaration of King Alexander's dictatorship in 1929. On 2 September 1935, Jonić and attorney [[Milan Aćimović]] petitioned the Yugoslav [[Ministry of the Interior (Yugoslavia)|Ministry of the Interior]] to legalize Zbor. On 8 November, the Ministry of the Interior conceded and recognized Zbor as an official political party.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=15}} German officials in Yugoslavia quickly took notice of the movement, with the German envoy to Yugoslavia, [[Viktor von Heeren]], providing it with financial assistance and infiltrating it with German agents.{{sfn|Kranjc|2013|p=39}} A German observer noted: "The movement Zbor represents a kind of national socialist party. Its principles are the struggle against Freemasons, against Jews, against Communists and against western [[capitalism]]."{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=15}} German industrial firms provided Zbor with further financial aid, as did German intelligence services.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=15}} Most of the support that Zbor received in Serbia came from members of the urban middle class, as well as right-wing students and members of the armed forces. The majority of Zbor's members were ethnic [[Serbs]], with some [[Croats]] and [[Slovenes]] joining the party in small numbers. Its membership fluctuated often, primarily due to disagreements over Ljotić's authoritarianism and lack of popularity and political power in Serbia.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=297}} Ljotić was an unpopular figure in Serbia due to his pro-German sympathies and religious fanaticism.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=299}} The limited amount of support received by Zbor itself stemmed from the fact that radical right-wing sentiment was not strong amongst the Serbian population. The reason for this was that far right-wing politics were associated with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Being extremely anti-German, the majority of ethnic Serbs rejected fascist and Nazi ideas outright.{{sfn|Pribičević|1999|p=194}} Zbor never had more than 10,000 active members at any given time, with most of its support coming from Smederevo and from the ethnic German (''[[Volksdeutsche]]'') minority in [[Vojvodina]] that had been exposed to [[Nazi]] propaganda since 1933.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=299}}

During [[Milan Stojadinović]]'s premiership, many members of Zbor left the party and joined Stojadinović's [[Yugoslav Radical Union]] ({{lang-sh|Jugoslovenska radikalna zajednica}}, JRZ).{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=297}} Nevertheless, the movement continued to advocate the abandonment of [[individualism]] and [[parliamentary democracy]]. Ljotić called for Yugoslavia to unite around a single ruler and return to its religious and cultural traditions, embracing the teachings of Christianity, traditional values and [[corporatism]]. He advocated a centrally organized state, stating that the unification of [[South Slavs]] was a historical and political inevitability and that Serbs, Croats and Slovenes shared "blood kinship and feeling of common fate." At the same time, the Yugoslavia that Ljotić envisioned was one that was to be dominated by Serbia.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=298}} Zbor openly promoted [[antisemitism]],{{sfn|Vucinich|1969|p=24}} being the only party in Yugoslavia to openly do so,{{sfn|Pešić|2008|p=207}} as well as [[xenophobia]].{{sfn|Vucinich|1969|p=24}}

==1935 and 1938 elections==
Despite its opposition to parliamentary democracy, Zbor participated in the 1935 Yugoslav parliamentary elections.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=298}} It offered 8,100 candidates throughout Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=16}} On 5 May the Yugoslav government first announced the results of the elections, which showed that 72.6 percent of the eligible electorate had cast a total of 2,778,172 ballots. The party of [[Bogoljub Jevtić]] had received 1,738,390 (62.6%) votes and 320 seats in parliament and the Opposition Bloc led by [[Vladko Maček]] had received 983,248 (35.4%) votes and 48 seats. Zbor finished last in the polls, with 23,814 (0.8%) votes, and had acquired no seats in parliament.{{sfn|Rothschild|1974|p=249}} Of all the votes it had received, 13,635 came from the [[Danube Banovina]], in which Ljotić's home district of Smederevo was located.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=187}} The election results initially published by authorities caused an upheaval amongst the public, forcing the government to publish the results of a recount on 22 May. The recount showed that 100,000 additional ballots that had not been recorded on 5 May had been cast and that Jevtić's party had received 1,746,982 (60.6%) votes and 303 seats, the Opposition Bloc had received 1,076,345 (37.4%) and 67 seats, and that Zbor had received 24,008 (0.8%) votes and again no seats.{{sfn|Rothschild|1974|p=249}}

In 1937, Ljotić began attacking Stojadinović through Zbor publications and accused him of complicity in King Alexander's assassination three years earlier.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=16}} Stojadinović's government responded by exposing Ljotić as having been funded by the Germans and provided with financial resources by them to spread Nazi propaganda and promote German economic interests in Serbia.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=299}} The incriminating material linking Ljotić with the Germans was given to Yugoslav authorities by German [[Luftwaffe]] commander [[Hermann Göring]], a supporter of Stojadinović.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=17}} Stojadinović used these revelations to his benefit in [[Yugoslavian parliamentary election, 1938|the following year's parliamentary elections]], presenting his opponents, including Ljotić, as "disloyal agitators".{{sfn|Vucinich|1969|p=26}} Ljotić responded by attacking Stojadinović through issues of ''Otadžbina'', many of which were subsequently banned. The Stojadinović government went on to prohibit all Zbor rallies and newspapers, confiscated Zbor propaganda material, and arrested Zbor leaders. In September 1938, Ljotić was arrested after the Yugoslav [[gendarmerie]] opened fire on a crowd of Zbor supporters, killing at least one person.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=17}} A frequent churchgoer, he was charged with religious [[mania]] and briefly sent to an [[insane asylum]] before being released.{{sfn|Payne|1996|p=326}}{{sfn|Crampton|1997|p=163}} On 10 October, Stojadinović dissolved the [[Parliament of Yugoslavia]], proclaimed new elections and arranged further arrests of Zbor members. Ljotić responded by publicly stating that Zbor supporters were being arrested in order to prevent them from participating in the forthcoming elections.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=17}} The parliamentary elections of December 1938 offered three candidates—Stojadinović, Maček, and Ljotić.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=18}} During voting itself, members of opposition parties, including Zbor, were arrested and subjected to police intimidation and voting registers were allegedly falsified in Stojadinović's favour.{{sfn|Vucinich|1969|p=26}} Zbor finished last in the elections, receiving 30,734 (1.01%) votes, and again winning no seats in parliament.{{sfn|Vucinich|1969|p=26}} 17,573 of the votes in favour of Zbor were cast in the Danube Banovina, while the number of votes in the Dalmatian [[Littoral Banovina]] increased from 974 in May 1935 to 2,427 in December 1938.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=187}}

==World War II==

===1939–1941===
In August 1939, Ljotić's cousin, [[Milan Nedić]], was appointed Yugoslav [[Ministry of Defense (Yugoslavia)|Minister of Defense]].{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=300}} Later that year, almost all Zbor publications, including ''Otadžbina'', ''Buđenje'', ''Zbor'', ''Naš put'' (Our Path) and ''Vihor'' (Whirlwind), were prohibited.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=17}} Ljotić exploited the connections he had with Nedić to ensure that the banned Zbor-published journal ''Bilten'' (Bulletin) was distributed to members of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]]. The journal was published illegally in a military printing house and distributed throughout the country by military couriers. Ljotić was the journal's main contributor and editor-in-chief. Fifty-eight issues of ''Bilten'' were published from March 1939 until October 1940, in which Ljotić advocated a pro-Axis Yugoslav foreign policy and criticized Belgrade's tolerance of Jews. As many as 20,000 copies each were printed of later issues of the journal. Ljotić was particularly pleased with being able to exert his ideological influence over young military academy trainees as well as older officers.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|pp=18–21}}

With the outbreak of World War II, Ljotić supported Yugoslavia's policy of neutrality in the conflict while promoting the position that Yugoslav diplomacy should focus on relations with Berlin.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=187}} He vehemently opposed the August 1939 [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement]]{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=187}}{{sfn|Byford|2011|pp=300–301}} and repeatedly wrote letters to [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]] urging him to annul it.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=21}} In these letters, he advocated an immediate re-organization of the government according to Zbor ideology, the abolishment of Croatian autonomy, the division of the Royal Yugoslav Army into contingents of ethnic Serbs and some Croat and Slovene volunteers, who would be armed, and contingents of most Croats and Slovenes in the armed forces, who would serve as labour units and would be unarmed. Effectively, the purpose of all these points was to reduce non-Serbs in Yugoslavia to the status of second-class citizens.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=188}} By this point, Zbor was infiltrated by the German [[Gestapo]], the [[Abwehr]] (German military intelligence), and the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS).{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=20}} In 1940, the Royal Yugoslav Army purged its pro-German elements and Ljotić lost much of the influence he held over the armed forces.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=300}}

Ljotić's followers responded to the Cvetković–Maček Agreement with violence, clashing with the youth wing of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ).{{sfn|Byford|2011|pp=300–301}} These incidents attracted as many as 5,000 new members to Zbor and led to the formation of a Zbor student wing known as the ''White Eagles'' ({{lang-sh|Beli orlovi}}).{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=197}} In July 1940, Ljotić expressed his bitter opposition to the diplomatic recognition of the [[Soviet Union]] by Belgrade, which was meant to strengthen Yugoslavia internally in the case of war.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=187}}

On 23 October 1940, ''White Eagles'' members massed outside the campus of the University of Belgrade.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=13}} University president Petar Micić was a Zbor sympathizer. The Belgrade police, who were alleged to have had foreknowledge of the riots, withdrew from the area before violence erupted.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=20}} The ''White Eagles'' members then threatened faculty and students with pistols and knives, stabbed some of them, hailed [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] as their heroes and shouted "down with the Jews!"{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=13}} Members of ''Slovenski Jug'' (Slavic South), a Serbian nationalist movement, also participated in the riots, which were orchestrated by Ljotić in the hope that violence would provoke [[martial law]] and thus bring about a more centralized system of control in the university. The Serbian public responded to the riots with outrage. On 24 October, the Yugoslav government revoked Zbor's legal status. On 2 November, the Ministry of Interior sent a list of Zbor members to all municipal administrators in Serbia.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=20}} The government cracked down on Zbor by detaining several hundred members, forcing Ljotić into hiding.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=197}} One of the only public figures in Serbia to speak in favour of Ljotić during this period was Serbian Orthodox Bishop [[Nikolaj Velimirović]], who praised his "faith in God" and "good character".{{sfn|Byford|2008|p=51}} Although a government investigation found that Zbor was guilty of high treason for accepting German funds, the authorities were careful not to arrest Ljotić in order to not provoke the Germans. Ljotić was placed under government surveillance but authorities quickly lost track of him. He hid with friends in Belgrade and remained in contact with Nedić and Velimirović. On 6 November, Nedić resigned from his post to protest the government crackdown on Zbor. Additional issues of ''Bilten'' continued to be printed despite his resignation. These supported a pro-Axis Yugoslav foreign policy, criticized the government's tolerance of Jews and Freemasons and attacked pro-British members of the government for their opposition to Yugoslavia signing the [[Tripartite Pact]].{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=21}} Ljotić remained in hiding until April 1941.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=301}}

===1941–1945===
 {{see also|Government of National Salvation}}
On 6 April 1941, [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] Yugoslavia. Poorly equipped and poorly trained, the Royal Yugoslav Army was quickly defeated.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=28}} Several dozen Royal Yugoslav Army officers affiliated with Zbor were captured by the [[Wehrmacht]] during the invasion, but were quickly released. The Germans sent Ljotić a written notice assuring his freedom of movement in German-occupied Serbia.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=29}} Not long after German forces entered Belgrade, Ljotić's followers were given the task of selecting an estimated 1,200 Jews from the city's non-Jewish population.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=23}}

Upon occupying Serbia, the Germans prohibited the activity of all political parties except Zbor.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=230}} Although they originally intended to make Ljotić the head of a Serbian [[puppet government]], both Ljotić and the Germans realized that his unpopularity would make any government led by him a failure. The Germans soon invited Ljotić to join the initial Serbian puppet government, the Commissioner Administration of [[Milan Aćimović]]. Ljotić was offered the position of economic commissioner but never took office, partly because he disliked the idea of playing a secondary role in the administration and partly because of his unpopularity.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=301}} He resorted to indirectly exerting his influence over the Serbian puppet government through two of his closest associates, Zbor members Stevan Ivanić and Miloslav Vasiljević, whom the Germans had selected as commissioners.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=31}} The Germans trusted Ljotić more than any other ethnic Serb in occupied Yugoslavia. In need of a reliable collaborationist force to combat the [[Uprising in Serbia (1941)|Communist uprising]] that had erupted in the aftermath of the German occupation of Serbia, they gave him permission to form the Serbian Volunteer Detachments in September 1941.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=188}}

In October, Zbor organized the [[Grand Anti-Masonic Exhibition]] in Belgrade{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=302}} with German financial support.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=24}} The exhibition sought to expose an alleged Judeo-Masonic and Communist conspiracy for [[world government|world domination]] through several displays featuring [[antisemitic]] propaganda.{{sfn|Israeli|2013|p=24}} In December, the Serbian Volunteer Detachments were renamed the [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] ({{lang-sh|Srpski dobrovoljački korpus}}, SDK) and placed under the command of ''[[General of the Artillery (Germany)|General der Artillerie]]'' (lieutenant general) [[Paul Bader]]. Although it was not formally part of the [[Wehrmacht]], the SDK received arms, ammunition, food and clothing from the Germans. Its units were not allowed to move from their assigned territory without German authorization.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=189}} Ljotić himself had no control over the SDK, which was directly commanded by Colonel [[Kosta Mušicki]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=189–190}} Like the [[Serbian State Guard]], it was under the direct command of the [[SS and Police Leader|Higher SS and Police Leader]] [[August Meyszner]] and the Commanding General in Serbia. During operations its units were put under the tactical command of German divisions.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=183}} It was the only group of armed Serbs that the Germans ever trusted during the war, its units often being praised for valour in action by German commanders.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=191}} The SDK often helped the Gestapo track down and round up Jewish civilians who had managed to evade capture by the Germans{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=305}} and was involved in sending Jewish prisoners to the [[Banjica concentration camp]].{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=48}}

On 15 July 1942, [[Chetnik]] leader [[Draža Mihailović]] sent a telegram to the Yugoslav government-in-exile asking them to publicly denounce Ljotić, Nedić and the openly collaborationist Chetnik leader [[Kosta Pećanac]] as traitors. The Yugoslav government-in-exile responded by doing so publicly over [[BBC Radio]].{{sfn|Roberts|1987|p=63}} On 4 October 1944, Ljotić, along with Nedić and about 300 Serbian government officials, escaped from Belgrade with German officials.{{sfn|Portmann|2004|p=13}} Ljotić and the SDK arrived in [[Osijek]] by the end of October, where German official [[Hermann Neubacher]] agreed to arrange their safe passage towards the Slovenian coast.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=59}} In early 1945, Chetnik leader [[Pavle Đurišić]] decided to move to the [[Ljubljana]] Gap independent of Mihailović, and arranged for Ljotić's forces already in Slovenia to meet him near [[Bihać]] in western Bosnia to assist his movement.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=447–448}} Between March and April, Ljotić and Mihailović exchanged messages concerning a last-ditch alliance against the Partisans. Although the agreement was reached too late to be of any practical use, the forces of Ljotić and Mihailović came together under the command of Chetnik General [[Miodrag Damjanović]] on 27 March.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=191}}

Ljotić did not live to see the end of the war. He was killed in a car accident in Slovenia on 23 April 1945.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=307}} In early May, Damjanović led most of the troops under his command into northwestern Italy, where they surrendered to the British and were placed in detention camps.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=191}} Many were extradited to Yugoslavia, where an estimated 1,500–3,100 were executed by the Partisans{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=127}} and buried in mass graves in the [[Kočevski Rog]] plateau.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=307}} Others immigrated to western countries, where they established émigré organizations intended to promote Zbor's political agenda.{{sfn|Byford|2011|p=307}} Many of Ljotić's followers settled in [[Munich]], where they ran their own publishing house and printed a newspaper called ''Iskra'' (Spark). In 1974, Ljotić's brother was shot and killed by agents of the Yugoslav [[State Security Service (Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)|State Security Service]] (''Uprava državne bezbednosti'', UDBA).{{sfn|Hockenos|2003|p=119}} The antagonism between pro-Ljotić groups and those affiliated with the Chetniks continued in exile.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=191}}
