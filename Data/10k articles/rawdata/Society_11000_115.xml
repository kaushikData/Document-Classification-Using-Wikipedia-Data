'''Muzaffar Adeeb''' or simply '''Adeeb''' (1934 – 26 May 2006) was a [[Pakistan]]i [[film]] [[actor]]. He appeared in 38 Indian films from 1940 to 1962, although he did not start performing in films very actively until the 1950s. In 1962, he shifted from [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai), [[India]], to [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] and resumed his film career that lasted until his death with over 500 films to his credit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citwf.com/person67085.htm, actor Adeeb's filmography on C.I.T.W.F. website, Retrieved 15 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.dawn.com/news/194197/filmstar-adeeb-dies | title=Filmstar Adeeb dies | newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] | date=27 May 2006 | accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in Bombay in a conservative [[Pashtun people|Pakhtun]] (Pathan) family from [[Kashmir]]. His family moved on to Bombay before [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] in 1947 and that is where the actor in him emerged, after the completion of his [[Master's Degree]] in [[Urdu literature]] from [[Bombay University]] Maharashtra. Unlike his contemporaries, scriptwriting was the first love of Adeeb, who worked in the scriptwriting department with [[Raj Kapoor]]'s father, Prithvi Raj Kapoor, in [[Prithvi Theatre]] and later with Indian National Theatre as assistant director. It is during this time in India that he got to know the basics of acting which later helped him entertain 2 generations of audience.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

Although he worked in minor roles in his initial career, it was [[Zia Sarhadi]]'s ''[[Footpath (1953 film)|Footpath]]'' (1953) that gave him his first breakthrough role opposite [[Dilip Kumar]], [[Meena Kumari]] and [[Anwar Hussain (actor)|Anwar Hussain]] ([[Nargis]]'s brother). He worked in 30 films during his stay in India including ''[[Mehndi]]'', ''Pak Daman'' and ''Jung'', before migrating to Pakistan in 1962, on the insistence of director Akbar Ali Akku and actor/director Iqbal Yusuf, son of Adeeb’s close friend, director S.M. Yusuf. He settled in [[Karachi]] and later moved on to [[Lahore]] in search of roles which kept pouring in from the 1960s until his very last film – Syed Noor’s super-hit [[Majajan]] (2006).

In an era when on-screen villainy in Pakistani films was ruled by good looking villains such as [[Aslam Pervaiz]], Masood Akhtar and even [[Mohammad Ali (actor)|Mohammad Ali]] (in his initial films), Adeeb made his entry with ''Daal Mein Kala'' (1964), which was directed by Iqbal Yusuf and featured [[Syed Kamal]] and [[Bahar Begum]] in the lead along with late actors Nirala and Mohammad Ali.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; In the coming years, he became close to Mohammad Ali and the two acted in numerous successful films such as [[Kaneez (1965 film)]], ''Aadil (1966)'' and ''Baghi Sardar'' (1966), ''Hatim Tai'' (1967), ''Mahal'' (1968), ''Naaz'' (1969), ''Aansoo Ban Gaye Moti'' (1970), ''Dushman'' (1974), ''Shirin Farhad'' (1975), ''Haider Ali'' (1979), ''Josh'', ''Sangram'' (1981), ''Zanjeer'' (1986) with ''Rocky Dada'' being their last film together in 1987.

He was at ease in both [[Urdu]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] films, playing memorable roles in countless films opposite other actors such as [[Sultan Rahi]] in ''[[Maula Jatt]] (1979)'' and ''Andaata'', [[Waheed Murad]] in ''Eid Mubarak (1965)'' and [[Kaneez (1965 film)]], ''Saaz Aur Awaaz'' (1965), ''[[Rishta Hai Pyar Ka]]'' (1967), ''Aik Nagina'' (1969), ''Afsana'' (1970) and ''Dushman'' (1974), [[Syed Kamal]] in ''Daal Main Kaala'' (1962) and ''Shab Bakhair'' and Nadeem in ''Talaash'' (1986), ''Ustadon Kay Ustad'' (1990) and ''Khazana'' (1995). Late directors – [[Saeed Khan Rangeela|Rangeela]]'s ''[[Diya Aur Toofan (1969 film)]]'' and [[Riaz Shahid]]'s ''Gharnata and Yeh Aman'' (both 1971) – gave Adeeb tailor-made roles in their films to show his true potential. He was one of the few actors to work with actor Shaan's father, [[Riaz Shahid]], and portray the character of his on-screen father.

During his last years, he was more active on stage than in films and depicted the role of Sir [[Syed Ahmed Khan]] in one of his last TV plays. In a career spanning over 50 years, Adeeb featured in more than 500 films, depicting villainous roles in different shades such as a deceiving brother, cruel father, nasty husband, dishonest friend and brutal landlord. Adeeb died on March 26, 2006, at the [[Punjab Institute of Cardiology]], [[Lahore]], where he was admitted after suffering a [[heart attack]] the previous week.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

'''Anfillo''' (also known as Mao or Southern Mao) is a Northern [[Omotic languages|Omotic]] language spoken in western [[Ethiopia]] by a few hundred people. The term Anfillo is used to refer both to the language and the people found in a small community in the [[Anfillo (woreda)|Anfillo]] [[woreda]], part of the [[Mirab Welega Zone]].  The language is on the verge of extinction as it is spoken only by adults above the age of sixty. All younger generations have shifted to Western Oromo.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

Anfillo has five [[vowel]]s and about 22 [[consonant]]s. Long vowels and consonants do occur and may have phonemic value. The basic word order is [[subject–object–verb]]. Nouns follow their modifier. Verbs are inflected for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[aspect (linguistics)|aspect]] and [[mood (linguistics)|mood]]. Three tenses are marked morphologically: present, past, and future. [[Grammatical gender|Gender]] and [[Grammatical number|number]] are expressed lexically.

'''Indo-Arabs''' are people with [[Arab]] origins who have over time settled in the [[India]].

==Communities==
[[Variav]] and [[Randev]] are the few villages that Arabs started their lives in. In [[Hyderabad]], [[Chaush]] are Arab community of [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] descent whose ancestors were recruited as soldier by [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. In coastal [[Karnataka]], [[Iraqis]] arrived during the reign of [[Tipu Sultan]]. They claim their ancestry from [[Banu Assad]]. These population migrations may have been favored by both the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] of [[Mysore]] because both had their ancestral linkages to these populations. The [[Asaf Jahi Dynasty]] claimed Arab ancestry from [[Asir Province]] and Tipu Sultan from the [[Bani Hashim]] of [[Hijaz]] Province in [[Arabia]]. Many Arabs having [[Adnani]] ancestry such as [[Quraishi]], [[Momin Ansari|Ansari]], [[Sayyid]] tribes and other descendants of the [[Sahaba]] were employed by the [[Princely States]] in their military as they were found efficient during warfare in Gujarat &amp; karnataka. In [[Kerala]], [[Thangal|Syed Thangals]] of Hadhrami descent settled around 17th century as missionaries to propagate [[Islam]]. 

There are also [[Shia|Shia Sayyids]] in Northern region of country who claim descent from [[Wasit]], [[Iraq]] like [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidis]] although many Arab genealogists dispute this fact. [[Sayyid of Uttar Pradesh|Sunni Sayyid]] of the country also claim Arab descent from [[Sufi]] missionaries. Most of the Sufis migrated from [[Persia]]. Sunni Sayyids claim their Arab ancestry through [[Imam Hassan]] or [[Imam Hussain]] in which case their names may be [[Hassani]], [[Hussaini]], [[Hashmi]], [[Naqvi]] and [[Bukhari (surname)|Bukhari]]. Some also claim descent from both and are termed "''Najeeb al-Tarfayn''" or "Noble on both sides". Many Sufi Saints such as [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] and [[Moinuddin Chishti]] and their descendants claim themselves as ''Najeeb al-Tarfayn'' although many genealogists dispute this fact. [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Sunni Sheikhs]] also claim Arab descent from Sufis or migrants. They don't know their tribe but trace lineage from [[Umar]] - [[Farooqi]], [[Abu Bakr]]- [[Siddiqui]], [[Uthman]] - [[Usmani]] and [[Ali|Alvi]] - [[Alawi]] , Alvi Awan or [[Mir]], who established the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. Many who can vaguely trace their lineage to the [[Quraish]] tribe call themselves [[Quraishi]]. Many having the name [[Ansari (nesba)|Ansari]] claim their lineage to the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] tribes of [[Madina Munawwara]] and the companions of the [[Prophet Muhammad]] such as [[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari]]. Many of the present Sheikhs converted from Hindu castes such as [[Kayasth]] and [[Rajput]].

There are several Arain or Araeen communities in Indian Punjab and Pakistan's [[Punjab]] as well. The Arain have origin from Syrian [[Umayyad]] town Arhia [[Jericho]] now in modern Palestine. According to sub continent's historians they came through Debal [[Sindh]] with [[Muhammad Bin Qasim]] and spread over [[Sindh]], [[Multan]] and [[Punjab]] region.&lt;ref&gt;https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/16228/PK&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early twentieth century, the Arabs abandoned [[Arabic]] for [[Urdu]].&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXII Part One Editors R. B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan and M Azeez Mohideen pages 74 to 77&lt;/ref&gt; Each clan is of equal status, but the Quraishis are accorded seniority on account of the fact that they were the tribe of the Prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="survey" /&gt;
The community have remained strictly endogenous, with virtually no cases of intermarriage with neighboring [[Gujaratis]] communities.&lt;ref name="survey" /&gt;

'''Asians in France''' or '''Asian French''' are either foreign residents or French citizens of Asian origin living in France. French citizens of Asian descent primarily have ancestry from the former [[French Indochina|French colonies in Asia]] ([[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]]) or [[China]]. Other Asian ethnic groups found in France include [[South Asia]]ns, [[Japan]]ese and [[Korea]]ns. [[Middle East]]erners are often not considered Asian in France because of large differences in culture and ethnic composition from the rest of the Asian continent as well as racial relationships between the group and general French populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigration.gouv.fr/spip.php?page=dossiers_det_res&amp;numrubrique=367&amp;numarticle=1855|title=La population étrangère résidant en France: Infos migrations|trans-title=The foreign population residing in France: Migration information|language=fr|publisher=immigration.gouv.fr|issue=10|date=October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127092438/http://www.immigration.gouv.fr/spip.php?page=dossiers_det_res&amp;numrubrique=367&amp;numarticle=1855|archivedate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambodians===
{{See also|Cambodians in France}}
The population of ethnic Khmers in France as of 2011 is estimated to be about 80,000, making the community one of the largest in the Cambodian diaspora.&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.international.champagne-ardenne.cci.fr/sites/international.champagne-ardenne.cci.fr/IMG/pdf/cambodge_fiche_pays.pdf|title=Cambodge|trans-title=Cambodia|language=fr|publisher=The Franco-Cambodian Chamber of Commerce|date=September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416181204/http://www.international.champagne-ardenne.cci.fr/sites/international.champagne-ardenne.cci.fr/IMG/pdf/cambodge_fiche_pays.pdf|archivedate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cambodian population in France has had a presence in the country dating to well before the [[Vietnam War]] and subsequent [[Indochina refugee crisis]], unlike counterpart communities in North America and Australia.

Early Cambodian immigration to France began in the latter half of the 19th century, when Cambodia became a [[French protectorate of Cambodia|French protectorate]]. The first migrants largely consisted of students and workers belonging to the country's elite class.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Montagnon]], ''La France coloniale'', tome 1, Pygmalion-Gérard Watelet, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; While most Cambodians arrived as refugees as a result of Indochina's heavy turmoil during the latter half of the 20th century, their large-scale arrival was later than other Indochinese immigrants. Although a few Cambodians were able to flee from the [[Khmer Rouge]] takeover in 1975 with French assistance, a much larger influx arrived in the 1980s following the regime collapse and end of the [[Cambodian Genocide]].&lt;ref name="specter"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Specter of Genocide: Mass Murder in Historical Perspective|first=Robert|last=Gellately|first2=Ben|last2=Kiernan|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese form the largest Asian group in France, with a population of roughly 600,000 as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Annabelle|last=Laurent|url=http://www.slate.fr/story/23827/chinois-de-france-ne-veut-rien-dire/|title='Chinois de France' ne veut rien dire|trans-title='Chinese of France' does not mean anything|language=fr|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|French Slate]]|date=28 June 2010|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Chinese migrants to France consisted of traders in the leather and Chinese ceramics trade originating from the [[Wenzhou]] region during the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chine-informations.com/guide/quartier-chinois-de-paris-arts-et-metiers_209.html|title=Le Quartier Chinois de Paris Arts-et-Métiers|trans-title=Paris Chinatown Arts and Crafts|language=fr|publisher=chine-informations.com|dead-url=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111012100/http://www.chine-informations.com/guide/quartier-chinois-de-paris-arts-et-metiers_209.html|archivedate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]], a few thousand Chinese laborers were recruited by the French Empire to help with war efforts in Metropolitan France, doing tasks such as working at munitions depots or ports and repairing railways and roads. A small number remained in France after the war ended, settling largely in the Chinese quarter of Paris established earlier by the Wenzhounese merchants, forming the basis of the Chinese community in France.&lt;ref name="picquart"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chinese Empire (L'Empire chinois)|last=Picquart|first=Pierre|publisher=Favre S.A.|year=2004|isbn=978-2-8289-0793-8|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese immigration to France continued as a trickle during the 1930s and 1940s, with some tradesmen and students arriving in the country, primarily to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkeurope.org/feature/eviction-rate-of-chinese-illegal-immigrants-in-france-on-rise|title=Eviction rate of Chinese illegal immigrants in France on Rise|first=Anustup|last=Roy|website=Network Europe|date=7 September 2007|accessdate=1 November 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106175626/http://www.networkeurope.org/feature/eviction-rate-of-chinese-illegal-immigrants-in-france-on-rise|archivedate=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A much larger inflow of ethnic Chinese arrived in France after the end of the [[Vietnam War]] and the heavy persecution of [[Hoa people|ethnic Chinese in Vietnam]] by the new communist government in 1975, along with a larger influx of immigrants from the Wenzhou region of China.&lt;ref&gt;''Straits Times'', 18 September 1978, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[13th arrondissement of Paris]] hosts Paris' [[Quartier Asiatique]], the largest and most important community for the city's Asian population. While originally an ethnic Vietnamese quarter, Chinese have become the largest Asian and ethnic group in the neighborhood following the former community's assimilation into French society. The [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] neighborhood of Paris also hosts an important Chinese community, as does the historical Chinese quarter founded by Wenzhounese merchants in the [[3rd arrondissement of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Craig S.|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/09/news/journal.php|title=Face behind Paris 'bistro' counter becomes Asian|newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=10 May 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050512033338/http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/09/news/journal.php|archivedate=12 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the colonial period, there was a significant representation of Vietnamese students in France, as well as professional and blue-collar workers, with a large number settling permanently. Following Vietnam's independence, a number of Vietnamese loyal to the colonial government also emigrated to France. However, the largest influx of Vietnamese people arrived in France as refugees after the [[Fall of Saigon]] and end of the Vietnam War in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eglasie.mepasie.org/divers-horizons/1995-10-16-la-diaspora-vietnamienne-en-france-un-cas La Diaspora Vietnamienne en France un cas particulier] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese community in France is the most successful among overseas Vietnamese communities, having a high level of both integration and success in academics and income. These achievements have led to French media and politicians regarding the French Vietnamese as a [[model minority]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tinparis.net/fr_societe/diaspora_viet.html La diaspora vietnamienne] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7080">The '''Bali''' people (also known as Bibaali, Maya, Ibaale, Abaali, Ibaale or Ibaali) are the communities, numbering 2,000 people, that settled the villages of Farabaune, Tashan Gurgu, Geidam/Tamgum, Tagombali Center, Duwo, Tamwa, Badan, Kwafara, Gidan-Rimi, Tamshe, Bali, and Bomni, located on Numan-Jalingo Highway about 20&amp;nbsp;km from Numan. Others who settled in the interior are: Janawuri, Salem (Babgye), Tagombali Dutse, Tangshi, Guri, Guri Kasuwa, Dingle, Kwabak, and Ubgo (Dingle Dutse) who speak the [[Bali language (Adamawa)|Bali language]]. Presently, Bali people are found in Demsa, Numan, Mayo Belwa Local Government areas of Adamawa State and Lau Local Government area of Taraba State. Majority of the people are agriculturalist, though there are traders, herders and civil servants among them.

==History==
Like any other ethnic groups in Nigeria, the Bali claims that they entered the Nigeria region from the east. The Bali, for example claim that they entered the Nigerian region from the Republic of Congo and through gradual process; they came and settled in their present geographical location.  The Kpasham and Bomni denied any knowledge of distance movement. They claim that they came from Bachama land, probably from Lamurde to the area they are now occupying.  The evidence points to Republic of Congo as their original homeland.

It is not known when the people left their original settlement. Probably, the people must have left their original settlement in the 17th century by which time there was population movement in the whole of the West, East and Central Africa as a result of famine, fracidal wars and chieftaincy tussle. The Bali might have formed part of the population that migrated to the [[Lake Chad basin]] area and, later to the Upper Benue Valley. Before the declaration of the Jihad in Fombina, in 1809, Bali had already settled in their various communities and has developed village governments or better still, community governments, independent of each other.

Apart from these community governments set up by the Bali, the people also had a well-defined social and economic system which rendered their societies stable. For example, one aspect of the social life of the people is that the Bali had great respect for life. In fact, the spilling of human blood was seen as offensive to Kpan Biswi (Kpan Luh or Luwe, among the Yotti and Kpasham respectively). Most Bali believed that it was Kpan Biswi that guide and sustain their livelihood. To the Bali, therefore, life was very sacred. The birth of a child was greeted with joy not only by the parents but also by the community as a whole. The growth and development of such a child was watched carefully by the entire community.

He was trained not only by his parents and relatives alone but by the community as a whole. This made Bali child useful member of his society.
Similarly, the death of a member was mourned by all and was seen as a great loss to the entire Bali Community. In short, there was social cohesion among the Bali people before the advert of Colonialism. For instance, an attack on any of the Bali Village by the enemy was seen as an attack on all. Besides, individual farmers or other hunters assisted their colleagues in time of need, especially through communal work (Gaya in Hausa). To put it in another way, during pre-colonial period, Bali Society was quite peaceful and people were hardworking. Their quarrels were settled among them peacefully, although on rare occasions, they resort to skirmishes.
During the first decade of the 19th century, Bali Land started to experience some political, economic and social disequilibrium. The declaration of the Jihad in Fombina in 1809 by, Modibbo Adama affected not only the Bali but the whole of the Upper Benue Region. The Jihadists attempted to overrun the whole of Bali land but without success. However, one devastating   impact of this Jihad on the people is that there were population movements throughout Bali land. In the process, many of the Bali lost their children, their relatives, friends and possessions to the Jihadists. Even before the declaration of the Jihad by Moddibo Lawan on Bali people, Baliland had been under constant threats from Fulani and Bachama slave raiders.

The threats posed to the Bali by the slave raiders and the menace of the Jihadists, led to restriction of Bali social, economic and political activities. Consequently, poverty gradually started to gain inroad into the society. A missionary, Ernest Engskor who visited Bali village in the early 1930S had this to bay:
Bali appeared to us to be one of the most wretched, primitive and poverty stricken of African villages, enslaved as the people were by ancient tradition and fear of evil spirit. Our had been on exceptional and unique experience for it was almost as though these people had awakened from their sleeping beauty enhancement to discover the great world beyond their  isolated society (Enskor, 1983:179).  
The Bali was gradually tackling the problems of slave raiders and Fulbe Jihadists, when British colonial masters extended their activities to Bali land. Eventually the people were conquered and brought under the British colonial administration in 1903.

In 1903 to 1912, the whole area South of Numan Town was regarded as “closed territory”. It was not until after 1912 that Bali land, including those living in Mayo-Belwa and Lau was opened to Christian missionaries.
By the 1940s, colonialism and Christianity were deeply noted in Bali villages. Indeed, while the Christian missions, especially the United Sudan Mission (SUM) were busy softening the minds of the people they saw as “uncivilized”, the British Colonial Masters were taking their resources away for the development of their home countries. The result is that Bali was left to face acute starvation and hunger. In this[1] way, colonialism continued to destroy Bali economy, technology and self-reliant development just as the slave raiders and Jihadists had done.
This was how the whole of Baliland became a British possession at the beginning of the 20th century like any other ethnic nationality in Nigeria. Indeed, slave trade and colonialism were the major forces that set back Bali development. The slave raiders dominated Bali homeland and the British exploited Bali homeland and the British exploited Bali resources.
       
Throughout colonial period, the Bali struggled to free themselves from colonial domination. In 1913, for example, one of the Bali men short and wounded a British Touring Officer who had gone to Bali for head account. In reprisal, Bali village was attacked and destroyed by the British punitive expedition. It took the people years to build their village. But this did not stop the people from opposing the British actively or passively. On 1 October 1960, however, the Bali people together with the rest of the ethnic groups in the country gained political independence from Britain.

'''Basque surnames''' refer to surnames with a Basque-language origin or a long, identifiable tradition in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]. They can be divided into two main types, patronymic and non-patronymic.

The patronymics such as Munioitz, Santxez or Santxitz, and Diaitz (Spanish spellings: Muñoz, Sánchez, and Díaz) are the most common and ancient. The Basque monarchy, including the first king of Pamplona, [[Íñigo Arista of Pamplona|Iñigo Iñigitz]], or Eneko Aritza, were the first to use this type of surname. Patronymics are by far the most common surnames in the whole of the Basque Autonomic Community and Navarre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20110515/mas-actualidad/sociedad/cincoapellidos-201105151951.html | title=Los apellidos más frecuentes de Euskadi| date=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-patronymic surnames are often toponymic ones that refer to the family's ''etxea'', the historically all important family home. When a farm ([[baserri]]) was rented to another family, often the new tenants were known locally by the farm name rather than by their officially registered surname. They also referred to the occupation of the head of the family such as Olaberria (new smith) or Salaberria (new farm/farmer) or could describe where their home was such as Elizondo (by the church).

==History==

===Oldest records===
The earliest documented Basque surnames occur on [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] inscriptions from the time of the [[Roman conquest of Hispania]] and [[Gallia Aquitania]]. For the most part these can be easily identified with modern or medieval Basque surnames, for example ''ENNECONIS'' (the personal name ''Eneko'' plus the [[Latin]] genitive ending -IS, stem augmented by -N) &gt; Enekoitz.

Also ''SEMBECONNIS'', possibly a derivative of the later surname [[Jiménez (surname)|Jimenez]] (''Scemeno'' attested in the 8–9th century). ''V(alerius) BELTESONIS'' (probable coinage from ''beltz'' 'black', less likely linked to ''bele/bela'' 'crow') engraved on the stella of Andriarriaga located in [[Oiartzun]] bears witness to a mixture of Roman and [[Vascones|Vasconic]] tradition in the local aristocracy during the Antiquity.

===Medieval names===
''[[García (surname)|García]]'', one of the most frequent [[Spanish surname]]s, was originally a Basque first name stemming from Basque ''gartzea'', 'the young'. Medieval Basque names follow this descriptive naming pattern about the person, pointing to physical features ("Gutia", "Motza", "Okerra", "Ezkerro", "Zuria", etc.), family relations or geographical origin, e.g. Eneko (Spanish [[Inigo|''Íñigo'']]) may be a [[hypocorism|hypocoristic]] mother-to-child addressing, 'my little'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euskaltzaindia.org/index.php?option=com_eoda&amp;Itemid=191&amp;lang=es&amp;testua=eneko&amp;view=izenak|title=Nombres: Eneko|publisher=Euskaltzaindia (The Royal Academy of the Basque Language)|accessdate=2009-04-23}} Article in Spanish&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, a totemic animal figure often stood for the person's presumable features.&lt;ref name="ApeVas"/&gt;{{rp|20}} ''[[Ochoa|Otxoa]]'' ("wolf") was a Basque version of the Romance name ''[[Lope (disambiguation)|Lope]]'', or the other way round, with an early medieval prevalence all around the Pyrenees and west into the [[Cantabrian Mountains]]. It is now a surname, like its akin "Otxotorena" ('little wolf's house', or possibly 'little wolf's wife'),&lt;ref name="ApeVas"/&gt;{{rp|144,}} so similar in meaning to Spanish "Lopez" (regional variants "Lopes", "Lupiz", etc.). "Velasco" was a name, later to become a surname, derived from Basque "belasko", 'small raven'. "Aznar" is a medieval Basque, Gascon and Spanish surname arguably based on old Basque "azenari", 'fox' (modern Basque "azeri", cf. old Basque "Zenarrutza" vs. modern Basque "Ziortza").&lt;ref name="ApeVas"/&gt;{{rp|63}}

The non-patronymic, descriptive Basque naming tradition came to a halt when in the 16th century Catholic Church tightened regulations to Christianize practices that didn't stick to the Church's orthodoxy (cf. given name ''Ochanda'', 'female wolf', in Vitoria-Gasteiz still in the 16th century).{{clarify|date=February 2017}} Thereafter, Romance first names were imposed, while surnames went on to express place descriptions (e.g. "Luzuriaga", 'place of white earth') and parental origin (e.g. "[[Marinelarena]]", 'the sailor's son')&lt;ref name="ApeVas"/&gt;{{rp|83, 126}} for the most part. The patronymics are derived from the father through the suffix -''ez, -oz, -iz'' or ''-az'' which means 'of'. The Basque language also expresses family links with the genitive suffix ''-(r)ena'', e.g. Perurena, Arozena, etc., meaning 'belonging to'.

===Upper nobility===
The first king of Navarre, [[Íñigo Arista of Pamplona]], is said to hail from the lineage of Iñigo (Eneko). While the use of ''-ez'' was the norm amongst the monarchs of Pamplona and the [[Lordship of Biscay|Lords of Biscay]], the first record we have of the use of ''-ez'' in the monarchs of Leon is through the consort queens from Navarre: [[Jimena of Asturias]], [[Oneca of Pamplona]] or [[Urraca Fernández]].

Marital alliances between the Christian kingdoms of Leon and Navarre were typical in the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries in order to protect themselves from the southern Islamic attacks. Proof is the fact that the king [[Alfonso V of León]] was mainly of Basque-Navarrese origin through his mother [[Elvira García of Castile|Elvira García]] and his paternal grandmother [[Urraca Fernández]].

On the other hand, the first king of Aragón, [[Ramiro I of Aragon]], was son of [[Sancho III of Navarre]], grandson of [[García Sánchez II of Pamplona]] and great-grandson of [[Sancho Garcés II of Pamplona]], all of them kings of Navarre who used the suffix ''-ez'' and that could have introduced it in this region.

As a result of the [[Reconquista]], the [[Douro]] basin was repopulated, most probably by people mainly coming from Navarre, Biscay, Cantabria or Alava, who used the suffix ''-ez''. Furthermore, it is possible that many of the most common patronymic Spanish surnames are not only of Basque-Navarrese origin, but also of royal and aristocratic background. It is logical to assume that the royal families from Leon, Navarre, Aragón and the aristocracy of Biscay, Alava or La Rioja would have had larger numbers of offspring than the regular population given their greater financial means and longer life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://iris.cnice.mec.es/kairos/ensenanzas/bachillerato/espana/rcristianos_03_01.html | title=Ensenanzas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar and orthography==
The grammar of the patronymic endings ''-ez'', ''-iz'' or ''-oz'' is very similar to that of their use to denote origin or content such as ''egurrez'' (made of wood), ''harriz'' (made of stone) or ''ardoz bete'' (full of wine). In Basque, -z is added to the end of the word if it ends in vowel (as in Muñoz, offspring of Munio) or -ez if the word ends in consonant (as in Antúnez, offspring of Anton). This grammar structure is not always the case in the patronymic surnames, e.g., González, offspring of Gonzalo. However, in  documents of the 10th, 11th and 12th century linked to the Monastery of Santa Maria de Nájera, we find old versions of these surnames such as Galindoz, Enecoz, Albaroz, Ordonioz, Munioz de Alava o Lopiz de Bizcaya. It is possible that the proper Basque grammar of the patronymic was lost as its use was extended south of the Basque country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/fuentes/docs35.pdf|title = Colección documental Santa María de Najera|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the medieval period Basque names were written broadly following the spelling conventions of the official languages of the day, usually [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]]. The main differences lie in the way the relatively large number of Basque [[sibilant]]s are spelled. These are especially hard to represent using French spelling conventions, so on the whole, the French spelling of Basque words in general tends to be harder to reconcile with the modern spellings and the pronunciation. Also, vowel-initial Basque surnames from the [[Northern Basque Country]] acquired an initial d (French ''de'') in many cases, often obscuring the original Basque form e.g. Duhalt &lt; de + uhalte ('the stream environs'), Dotchandabarats &lt; de + otxandabaratz ('orchard of the female wolf'), Delouart &lt; del + uharte ('between streams').

Since the introduction of [[Standard Basque]] and a common written standard, the number of non-indigenous spelling variants has begun to decrease, especially in Spain, taking on a form in accordance with the meaning of the surname in Basque, which remains irrelevant in other language spellings.

==Conventions==
[[File:Guecho, Santa Maria de Guecho - Iglesia de Andra Mari 18.jpg|thumb|Relieve with the names of the farmhouses of Getxo, on the wall of Saint Mary's church.]]
As is the legal convention in Spain, Basques in the South have double legal surnames, the first being that of the father and the second that of the mother. In the North, Basques legally have only one surname as is the convention in France. Nonetheless, most Basques can at least recite the surnames of their parents' and grandparents' generations.
The founder of [[Basque nationalism]], [[Sabino Arana]], demanded a certain quantity of Basque surnames from his followers in order to reject those of mixed Basque-Spanish descent.

In [[Alava]] and west of Navarre a distinctive formula has been followed, with the surname being composite, i.e. [a first title of [[Spanish language|Castilian]] origin; usually a patronymic which uses the Basque suffix ''-ez''] + ''de'' + [a Basque place-name (usually a village)],&lt;ref name="ApeVas"/&gt;{{rp|23–24}} take for instance ''Fernández de Larrinoa'', ''Ruiz de Gauna'' or ''López de Luzuriaga'', meaning 'Fernández from Larrinoa', etc., which does not imply a noble origin. Therefore, surnames can be very long if both paternal and maternal surnames are required when filling out a form for example.
Such forms have been found from as early as 1053.&lt;ref name="Auñamendi"&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/1383 Apellido] in the Spanish-language ''Auñamendi Entziklopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while it was popular in some circles to follow a convention of stating one's name that was invented by Sabino Arana in the latter part of the 19th century. He decided that Basque surnames ought to be followed by the [[ethnonym]]ic suffix ''-(t)ar''. Thus he adopted the habit of giving his name, ''Sabino Arana Goiri'', as ''Arana ta Goiri'taŕ Sabin''. This style was adopted for a while by a number of his fellow [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV/EAJ) supporters but has largely fallen out of fashion now.

These descriptive surnames can become very long. 
The family will probably be known by a short form or a nickname.
The longest Basque surname recorded is ''Burionagonatotorecagageazcoechea''&lt;!-- Can somebody translate? --&gt; sported by an employee at the Ministry of Finances in Madrid in 1867.&lt;ref name="Albaigès"&gt;''Enciclopedia de los nombres propios'', [[Josep M. Albaigès]], Editorial Planeta, 1995, {{ISBN|84-08-01286-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and composition==
The majority of modern Basque non patronymic surnames fall into two categories:
*a descriptive of the family house. This usually either refers to the relative location of the home or the purpose of the building.
*the first owner of the house. Usually this is a man's name. These surnames are relatively recent&lt;ref name="Auñamendi"/&gt;

Surnames from either category are formed using nouns, adjectives, a number of [[suffix]]es and endings such as the [[absolutive]] ending ''-a'', the [[Basque grammar#Adjectival -ko|adjectival suffix ''-ko'']], and the [[genitive]] ending ''-ren''. An example of the second class are ''Martinikorena'' ("Martinico's [house]", Martinico being a Navarrese [[hypocorism]] for ''[[Martin (name)|Martin]]''). 
Another would be ''Mikelena'', "Michael's".

The following examples all relate to the location of the family home.

==Recognizing Basque non-patronymic surnames==
Basque non patronymic surnames are relatively easy to spot through the high frequency of certain elements and endings used in their formation, bearing in mind the spelling variants. Outside the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]], Basque surnames are often found [[Spanish surnames|in Spain]] and [[French names|France]], the former [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]] in parts of [[South America]] and [[Philippine surnames|the Philippines]] and parts of the [[United States]] such as [[Idaho]] where substantial numbers of Basques emigrated to.

'''British Peruvians''' are [[Peruvians]] of British descent. The phrase may refer to someone born in [[Peru]] of  British descent. Among [[European Peruvians]], the British were the fifth largest group of immigrants to settle in the country after the Spanish, Germans, Italians, the Swiss or/and the French.

== History ==
Between 1860 and 1950 it is estimated that around 1900{{cn|date=August 2018}} British settled in [[Peru]], although many of them returned to Europe or emigrated to countries like [[Argentina]] or [[Chile]]. The regions from which most of the British immigrants originated were [[Southampton]] and London, as well as [[Birmingham]] and [[Liverpool]].

In 1872, the ''Sociedad de Inmigración Europea'' ("European Immigration Society") was founded in Peru. Its objective was promoting [[Old World]] [[immigration]] by covering the costs of their journeys and financially supporting them during their first settler years in Peru.

They mostly interacted with fellow British immigrants, and were usually relatively skilled at a trade. Many of them intermarried and at the beginning they were united, but as time passed many of them broke the circle. The British corporations owned many [[Sodium nitrate|salitre]] mines in the [[Tacna]] region during World War I when the territory was then Chilean ruled. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Many British Peruvians left the nation in 1960s and 1970s to flee from excessive poverty. Others fled in response to the dictatorship of Gen. [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] and most of these moved to United States, United Kingdom and Spain, while most of the rest to Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The second wave of British Peruvians left during the [[Alan García]] regime that led Peru to extreme poverty and hyperinflation.

==Cultural legacy==
[[Inca Kola]] was invented by an English immigrant. In 1911, in [[Rímac District|Rímac]], one of [[Lima]]'s oldest and most traditional neighborhoods, an immigrant English family began a small bottling company under their family name, Lindley. In 1928, the company was formally chartered in Peru as [[Corporación José R. Lindley S.A.]], whereupon Joseph R. Lindley became its first General Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sisviso.plades.org.pe/sisviso/empresas.jsp?idempresaf=F0003|title=Empresas Transnacionales en el Perú: Breve Reseña Histórica|trans-title=Transnational Companies in Peru: Brief Historical Review|language=es|publisher=[[PLADES]]|accessdate=January 11, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022043300/http://sisviso.plades.org.pe/sisviso/empresas.jsp?idempresaf=F0003|archivedate=October 22, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EMPRESAS TRANSNACIONALES EN EL PERÚ: Nestlé Peru S.A.|accessdate=January 11, 2012|date=|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creditosperu.com.pe/pp-corporacion-jose-r-lindley-s-a.php|title=Directorio de las principales empresas y entidades del Perú: Corporacion Jose R.

The  '''National Corporation for Indigenous Development''', or '''Corporación Nacional de Desarrollo Indígena''' (CONADI') in [[spanish language|Spanish]],  is a Chilean institution founded in September 28, 1993 by the "Ley Indigena 19253" (“Indigenous Law”).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bcn.cl/1lzcg Indigenous law] Biblioteca del congreso nacional, retrieved on June 09, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

CONADI's main goal is to promote, coordinate and execute the state’s work to support the development of the [[Indigenous peoples in Chile|indigenous peoples]] of [[Chile]].

CONADI is overseen by the Social Development Ministry or "[[:es:Ministerio de Desarrollo Social de Chile]]". Its headquarters are located in the city of [[Temuco]] and it has two subdivisions: Temuco, covering the [[Bío Bío Region|Bío Bío]], [[Araucanía Region|Araucanía]], [[Los Lagos Region|Los Lagos]] and [[Los Ríos Region|Los Ríos]] [[Regions of Chile|regions]], and [[Iquique]], covering the [[Tarapacá Region|Tarapacá]], [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]] and [[Arica y Parinacota Region|Arica y Parinacota]]  [[Regions of Chile|regions]].

==Background ==

CONADI was founded as a result recommendations made by the Special Commission on Indigenous Peoples or "Comisión Especial de Pueblos Indígenas" (CEPI) which ran from 1990 to 1995 was created by decree No. 30 of May 27, 1990. 
As a result of its work, CEPI produced a report with three recommendations: reform the [[Constitution of Chile|national constitution]] to include indigenous peoples; ratify the [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention]] ([[International Labour Organization|ILO]] Convention No. 169),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/indigenous/Conventions/no169/lang--en/index.htm Convention No. 169] International labour organization www.ilo.org retrieved on June 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and create the Indigenous Law that ultimated founded CONADI.  The third of these recommendations was approved by the [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean National Congress]] and was subsequently promulgated in the Programme for Indigenous Rights (2003). Congress also later ratified ILO Convention No. 169.

== Indigenous Law ==

As part of the initiatives to repair historic damage and encourage the development and social inclusion of indigenous peoples, Chile’s Indigenous Law was created in the 1990s. Following the [[Chilean transition to democracy|return to democracy]], [[Patricio Aylwin]]'s government established the Special Commission of Indigenous People (''Comisión Especial de Pueblos indígenas'' or CEPI), whose report provided the intellectual framework of the Indigenous Law ''Ley Indígena'' or law n° 19 253, promulgated on September 28, 1993 by President Aylwin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uta.cl/masma/patri_edu/PDF/LeyIndigena.PDF LEY Nº 19.253 - LEY INDÍGENA] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indigenous Law recognized all indigenous peoples of Chile, in particular the [[Mapuche people]], victims of the [[Occupation of the Araucanía]], as an inherent part of the Chilean nation. Other indigenous people officially recognized included the [[Aymara people|Aymara]], [[Atacameña]], [[Qulla people|Colla]], [[Quechua people|Quechua]], [[Rapa-Nui]], [[Yámana]] and [[Kawashkar]] peoples. Later, in 2006, the [[Diaguita people]] were also added to the list.

The law established the National Corporation for Indigenous Development (''CONADI''), which included directly elected indigenous representatives, and advised and directed government programs to assist the economic development of indigenous people.

It also gives indigenous people a voice in decisions affecting their lands, cultures and traditions and provides for bilingual education (legalizing [[Mapudungun]] language) in schools with indigenous populations.

Approximately half of the self-identified indigenous population remained separated from the rest of society, largely due to historical, cultural, educational, and geographical factors. Both internal factors and governmental policies had previously limited the ability of indigenous people to participate in governmental decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and the allocation of natural resources. Indigenous people also experienced some societal discrimination and reported incidents in which they were attacked and harassed. A 2003 Ministry of Planning survey reported that indigenous people earned 26% less than nonindigenous citizens for similar work.

Chile is one of the 20 countries to have signed and ratified the only binding international law concerning indigenous peoples, [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/ratifce.pl?C169{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted in 1989 as the [[International Labour Organization]] Convention 169. Chile ratified the convention in 2008. In November 2009, a court decision in Chile, considered to be a landmark in indigenous rights concerns, made use of the ILO convention 169. The [[Supreme Court of Chile|Supreme Court]] decision on Aymara water rights upheld rulings by both the [[Pozo Almonte]] tribunal and the Iquique Court of Appeals, and marked the first judicial application of ILO Convention 169 in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiagotimes.cl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17739:chiles-supreme-court-upholds-indigenous-water-use-rights&amp;catid=19:other&amp;Itemid=142 |title=Chile’s Supreme Court Upholds Indigenous Water Use Rights |publisher=The Santiago Times |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Wednesday since the death of Tyrone West on Thursday, July 18, 2013, his sister Tawanda Jones has led family members and supporters in weekly demonstration to keep the spotlight on her brother.&lt;ref name="Interview with Tawanda Jones in 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/story-tyrone-west-sister-fighting-justice|title=The Story of Tyrone West, and the Sister Who Keeps Fighting for Justice|work=TheOdysseyOnline.com| first=Sheridan|last=Merrick|date=March 20, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning on Wednesday, July 24, 2013, a prayer vigil was held by the community at the intersection, the weekly gathering continuing to the present time under the name West Wednesdays.&lt;ref name="Dispatch calls released in 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2013/07/23/dispatch-calls-released-after-man-dies-in-police-custody/ |title=Dispatch Calls Released After Man Dies In Police Custody|work=Baltimore.CBSlocal.com| first=Monique|last=Griego|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview with Tawanda Jones in 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/story-tyrone-west-sister-fighting-justice|title=The Story of Tyrone West, and the Sister Who Keeps Fighting for Justice|work=TheOdysseyOnline.com| first=Sheridan|last=Merrick|date=March 20, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family of West alleged that some of the officers in the case were also present during the death of Anthony Anderson on September 21, 2012, a Baltimore resident who died during a police encounter, but none of the officers were actually involved.&lt;ref name="Independent report into Tyrone West incident in 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/236257430/Baltimore-Police-independent-report-into-Tyrone-West-death |title=Baltimore Police independent report into Tyrone West death |work=Scribd.com|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 23, 2014, the family of Tyrone West filed a multimillion-dollar federal lawsuit against 11 officers, the city of Baltimore's police commissioner Anthony W. Batts, and the police chief at Morgan State University.&lt;ref name="Multimillion Dollar lawsuit filed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2014/06/23/family-of-baltimore-man-who-died-in-custody-files-multi-million-suit-against-police/ |title=Family Of Baltimore Man Who Died In Custody Files Multimillion Dollar Lawsuit Against Police |work=Baltimore.CBSlocal.com|date=June 23, 2014|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Updated autopsy results 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-custody-death-20160430-story,amp.html |title=Report: Heart condition didn’t cause Tyrone West’s death in custody |work=BaltimoreSun.com|first=Juliet|last=Linderman|date=April 30, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cited assault, violation of civil rights, and wrongful death.&lt;ref name="Multimillion Dollar lawsuit filed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2014/06/23/family-of-baltimore-man-who-died-in-custody-files-multi-million-suit-against-police/ |title=Family Of Baltimore Man Who Died In Custody Files Multimillion Dollar Lawsuit Against Police |work=Baltimore.CBSlocal.com|date=June 23, 2014|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in police procedure===
At the conclusion of their internal investigation, the Baltimore Police stated, “While the criminal review of this difficult situation comes to an end, the internal evaluation of our tactics continues as we seek ways to improve.”&lt;ref name="No criminal charges against officers in 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2013/12/19/family-cries-cover-up-no-criminal-charges-filed-against-officers-in-death-of-tyrone-west/|title=Family Cries Cover-Up: No Criminal Charges Filed Against Officers In Death Of Tyrone West |work=Baltimore.CBSlocal.com| first=Meghan|last=McCorkell |date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the deaths of Anthony Anderson in 2012 and Tyrone West in 2013, the police department created a reform model to improve training and the investigation of in-custody deaths.&lt;ref name="Baltimore Police vow changes in 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2013/12/10/baltimore-police-department-to-change-the-way-they-deal-with-deaths-in-police-custody/ |title=Baltimore Police Department To Change The Way They Deal With Deaths In Police Custody |work=Baltimore.CBSlocal.com| first=Monique|last=Griego|date=December 10, 2013|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case also influenced change in department policy including limiting physical exertion during heat warnings, placing suspects in a sitting position after being handcuffed, and the use of tasers to subdue subjects with non-lethal force.&lt;ref name="Independent report into Tyrone West incident in 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/236257430/Baltimore-Police-independent-report-into-Tyrone-West-death |title=Baltimore Police independent report into Tyrone West death |work=Scribd.com|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Plainclothes officers patrolling North Baltimore were discontinued and police in uniform with much greater experience and minimum requirements were recruited to patrol.&lt;ref name="Independent report into Tyrone West incident in 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/236257430/Baltimore-Police-independent-report-into-Tyrone-West-death |title=Baltimore Police independent report into Tyrone West death |work=Scribd.com|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent investigation===
In 2014, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake commissioned another review of the case.&lt;ref name="Interview with Tawanda Jones in 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/story-tyrone-west-sister-fighting-justice|title=The Story of Tyrone West, and the Sister Who Keeps Fighting for Justice|work=TheOdysseyOnline.com| first=Sheridan|last=Merrick|date=March 20, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The independent review board was chaired by James K. Stewart and five doctors.&lt;ref name="Independent report into Tyrone West incident in 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/236257430/Baltimore-Police-independent-report-into-Tyrone-West-death |title=Baltimore Police independent report into Tyrone West death |work=Scribd.com|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They unanimously determined in August 2014 that West died suddenly while engaged in an extended period of resisting a lawful arrest, that excessive force was not used and did not contribute to the death of Tyrone West, but that officers did not completely follow protocol.&lt;ref name="No plans to reopen case in 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amp.wbaltv.com/article/prosecutors-will-not-reopen-tyrone-west-case/7100067|title=Prosecutors will not reopen Tyrone West case |work=WBALTV.com|date=April 14, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent report into Tyrone West incident in 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/236257430/Baltimore-Police-independent-report-into-Tyrone-West-death |title=Baltimore Police independent report into Tyrone West death |work=Scribd.com|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview with Tawanda Jones in 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/story-tyrone-west-sister-fighting-justice|title=The Story of Tyrone West, and the Sister Who Keeps Fighting for Justice|work=TheOdysseyOnline.com| first=Sheridan|last=Merrick|date=March 20, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board concluded that West died of cardiac arrhythmia due to cardiac conduction system abnormality aggravated by his struggle with police and dehydration during his restraint.&lt;ref name="Updated autopsy results 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-custody-death-20160430-story,amp.html |title=Report: Heart condition didn’t cause Tyrone West’s death in custody |work=BaltimoreSun.com|first=Juliet|last=Linderman|date=April 30, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview with Tawanda Jones in 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/story-tyrone-west-sister-fighting-justice|title=The Story of Tyrone West, and the Sister Who Keeps Fighting for Justice|work=TheOdysseyOnline.com| first=Sheridan|last=Merrick|date=March 20, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme environmental temperatures and heat index in the low 100s were also cited as a potential factor.&lt;ref name="Updated autopsy results 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-custody-death-20160430-story,amp.html |title=Report: Heart condition didn’t cause Tyrone West’s death in custody |work=BaltimoreSun.com|first=Juliet|last=Linderman|date=April 30, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent report into Tyrone West incident in 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/236257430/Baltimore-Police-independent-report-into-Tyrone-West-death |title=Baltimore Police independent report into Tyrone West death |work=Scribd.com|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The board also made 34 recommendations to improve training and officer accountability within the Baltimore Police Department.&lt;ref name="Independent report into Tyrone West incident in 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/236257430/Baltimore-Police-independent-report-into-Tyrone-West-death |title=Baltimore Police independent report into Tyrone West death |work=Scribd.com|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel determined that police did not follow basic policies and made tactical errors that potentially worsened the situation, including a lack of respect for motorists who are stopped in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="ThinkProgress article in 2015"/&gt; The review identified the initial departure from protocol as the moment Chapman left his partner alone before backup arrived to begin lawfully searching the vehicle.&lt;ref name="Independent report into Tyrone West incident in 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/236257430/Baltimore-Police-independent-report-into-Tyrone-West-death |title=Baltimore Police independent report into Tyrone West death |work=Scribd.com|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the pepper spray that incapacitated the officers should have been deployed when the suspect was at least three feet away, rather than in close proximity.&lt;ref name="Independent report into Tyrone West incident in 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/236257430/Baltimore-Police-independent-report-into-Tyrone-West-death |title=Baltimore Police independent report into Tyrone West death |work=Scribd.com|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ensuing protests===
The friction between the Baltimore Police Department and inner-city Baltimore residents was finally thrust into the national spotlight with the [[death of Freddie Gray]] in April 2015.&lt;ref name="ThinkProgress article in 2015"/&gt; The growing tension in Baltimore, influence by the death of Tyrone West and more directly by Freddie Gray, bubbled over in 2015 resulting in demonstrations and rioting.&lt;ref name="ThinkProgress article in 2015"/&gt; The death of Freddie Gray prompted the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] to investigate the police department, determining in a report on August 10, 2016, that there existed cases of excessive use of force, unlawful arrests, and discrimination against African Americans.&lt;ref name="Controversial autopsy results in 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbal.com/article/208580/3/new-autopsy-on-tyrone-west-finds-he-died-of-asphyxiation-while-restrained|title=New Autopsy On Tyrone West Finds He Died Of Asphyxiation While Restrained|work=WBAL.com|date=December 14, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ThinkProgress article in 2015"/&gt;
Tawanda Jones eventually met with the family of Freddie Gray and Attorney General Loretta Lynch who promised to look into the Tyrone West case.&lt;ref name="ThinkProgress article in 2015"/&gt;

==Controversy==
===Second autopsy===
In 2015, the West family attorney Dwight Petit hired Dr. William Manion to conduct an independent forensic investigation of Tyrone West's autopsy.&lt;ref name="Updated autopsy results 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-custody-death-20160430-story,amp.html |title=Report: Heart condition didn’t cause Tyrone West’s death in custody |work=BaltimoreSun.com|first=Juliet|last=Linderman|date=April 30, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Controversial autopsy results in 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbal.com/article/208580/3/new-autopsy-on-tyrone-west-finds-he-died-of-asphyxiation-while-restrained|title=New Autopsy On Tyrone West Finds He Died Of Asphyxiation While Restrained|work=WBAL.com|date=December 14, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manion, the chief of pathology at [[Memorial Hospital of Salem County|Memorial Hospital]] in [[Salem County, New Jersey]], concluded that he died by suffocation as a result of the way police restrained him, calling it positional asphyxia.&lt;ref name="Updated autopsy results 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-custody-death-20160430-story,amp.html |title=Report: Heart condition didn’t cause Tyrone West’s death in custody |work=BaltimoreSun.com|first=Juliet|last=Linderman|date=April 30, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicted earlier assertions that he died of a heart condition.&lt;ref name="Updated autopsy results 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-custody-death-20160430-story,amp.html |title=Report: Heart condition didn’t cause Tyrone West’s death in custody |work=BaltimoreSun.com|first=Juliet|last=Linderman|date=April 30, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Manion acknowledged the cardiac abnormality but did not believe it contributed to the death of West, submitting his findings in November 2015.&lt;ref name="Updated autopsy results 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-custody-death-20160430-story,amp.html |title=Report: Heart condition didn’t cause Tyrone West’s death in custody |work=BaltimoreSun.com|first=Juliet|last=Linderman|date=April 30, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview with Tawanda Jones in 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/story-tyrone-west-sister-fighting-justice|title=The Story of Tyrone West, and the Sister Who Keeps Fighting for Justice|work=TheOdysseyOnline.com| first=Sheridan|last=Merrick|date=March 20, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State’s Attorney’s office response===
In 2013, Assistant State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby defeated State's Attorney Gregg L. Bernstein, winning the election over the attorney who failed to bring charges in the West case.&lt;ref name="ThinkProgress article in 2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thinkprogress.org/amp/p/871b5d93d166?gi=570dd695ad13 |title=Her Brother Was Killed By The Baltimore Police Two Years Ago.

===Third autopsy===
Another independent autopsy was conducted in June 2016 by Dr. Adel Shaker, a former medical examiner in [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref name="Controversial autopsy results in 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbal.com/article/208580/3/new-autopsy-on-tyrone-west-finds-he-died-of-asphyxiation-while-restrained|title=New Autopsy On Tyrone West Finds He Died Of Asphyxiation While Restrained|work=WBAL.com|date=December 14, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaker also concluded that death was caused by positional asphyxia, suffocation from being restrained in a prone position.&lt;ref name="Controversial autopsy results in 2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbal.com/article/208580/3/new-autopsy-on-tyrone-west-finds-he-died-of-asphyxiation-while-restrained|title=New Autopsy On Tyrone West Finds He Died Of Asphyxiation While Restrained|work=WBAL.com|date=December 14, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missing evidence===
The drugs confiscated from the car driven by Tyrone West have been lost by the Baltimore Police Department.&lt;ref name="Missing evidence in 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/maryland/articles/2017-04-18/family-of-man-who-died-in-custody-evidence-missing-in-case|title=Family of Man Who Died in Custody: Evidence Missing in Case|work=USNews.com |first=Juliet|last=Linderman|date=April 18, 2017 |accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence was discovered missing when attorneys for the West family [[subpoena|subpoenaed]] the department to inspect the cocaine recovered at the scene, only to find it had disappeared.&lt;ref name="Missing evidence in 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/maryland/articles/2017-04-18/family-of-man-who-died-in-custody-evidence-missing-in-case|title=Family of Man Who Died in Custody: Evidence Missing in Case|work=USNews.com |first=Juliet|last=Linderman|date=April 18, 2017 |accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National television===
The case of Tyrone West gained national notoriety when his family appeared in the opening episode of the television series ''American Race''.&lt;ref name="Appearance on American Race in 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newsday.com/amp/sports/basketball/charles-barkley-shows-his-serious-side-in-american-race-1.13567359|title=Charles Barkley shows his serious side in ‘American Race’|work=NewsDay.com |first=Neil |last=Best |date=May 6, 2017 |accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They confronted the show's host, ex-[[National Basketball Association|NBA]] star Charles Barkley, who has frequently expressed support for both the black community and urban police departments while hoping for both to work together.&lt;ref name="Charles Barkley on police and black communities"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/07/charles-barkley-police-shootings-wild-west-nba|title=Charles Barkley defends stance on police: ‘We’d be living in the Wild Wild West’ without cops|work=USAToday.com |first=Andrew|last=Joseph|date=July 26, 2016 |accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Devi Thant Sin''' ({{lang-my|ဒေဝီသန့်စင်}}, also spelt '''Devi Thant Cin'''; born 2 January 1947) is a [[Myanmar|Burmese]] [[environmentalist]], writer and the leader of the [[Environmental movement]] in Burma. She against the [[Myitsone dam|Myitsone hydropower dam]], a controversial project backed by [[China]] at the mouth of the [[Irrawaddy River]].

She is founder of the ''Global Green Group'' (3G) and ''Myanmar Green Network''.&lt;ref name="aecen.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aecen.org/node/2096|title='We do not accept the government’s clean coal technology’/Devi Thant Cin Q&amp;A Interview|work=Asian Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Network|date=7 January 2017|accessdate=3 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background Image==
Devi Thant Sin was born in [[Yangon]], [[British Burma]] to Prince [[Taw Phaya Galay]] and Khin May. She is not only known for being a leading [[environmentalist]], but also as a Burmese princess and direct descendant of Myanmar's last monarch [[King Thibaw]] and Queen [[Supayalat]].&lt;ref name="royalark1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalark.net/Burma/konbau19.htm |title=The Konbaung Dynasty (part 19) |publisher=Royal Ark |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/lifestyle/13490-descended-from-royalty.html|title=Descended from royalty|work=[[The Myanmar Times]]|date=12 March 2015|author=Zon Pann Pwint|accessdate=3 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and movements==
She is considered one of Myanmar's first [[environmentalists]] and works to fight deforestation and environmental degradation in the Southeast Asian nation. She is a leading light in Myanmar's fledgling green movements. In a country where the focus is on much-needed development of the economy rather than protecting its resources, the work of environmentalists. She is the founder of the environmental activist organizations Global Green Group (3G) and the Myanmar Green Network. She despite having lived the life of a commoner, she still considers it her duty to look after the interests of the Burmese people by fighting to protect the environment.&lt;ref name="aecen.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="devi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/opinion/the-irrawaddy-river-is-like-a-mother.html|title=‘The Irrawaddy River Is Like a Mother’|work=[[The Irrawaddy]]|date=15 June 2013|author=Kyaw Phyo Tha|accessdate=3 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thant Sin first started writing about environmental awareness in the early 2000s. In 2007 she launched her own which was Myanmar's first environmental magazine, “Aung Pin Lae”, the magazine inform the public of the global green movement and environmental degradation in the country. She also began travelling through the country to give talks to farmers about the risk of using chemical fertilizers, while she spoke with students to inform the younger generation of environmental concerns. She was to help unify Myanmar's burgeoning green movement. She gathered together the country's handful of environmental activists in 2006 to form the Global Green Group (3G), followed closely by the Myanmar Green Network. The group is made up of shifting numbers of mining engineers, meteorologists, lawyers, civil engineers, activists, researchers and journalists.&lt;ref name="aecen.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="devi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mizzima.com/news-opinion/‘we-do-not-accept-government’s-clean-coal-technology’|title=Devi Thant Cin Q&amp;A|work=[[Mizzima News]]|date=7 January 2016|accessdate=3 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was against the [[Myitsone Dam|Myitsone hydropower dam]], a controversial project backed by China at the mouth of the [[Irrawaddy River]] in northern [[Kachin State]] that could cause widespread environmental devastation if it goes ahead. She said “''For the whole of Myanmar, the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] is like the mother river, If there is dam construction that they shouldn’t do, we point out that it’s not the time to do it''”. The environmental campaigns against the dam led to a nationwide public outcry, prompting President [[Thein Sein]] to suspend the project in 2011 until 2016, when his presidential term expires. In part thanks to Thant Sin and other protestors’ efforts, the project is currently on hold.&lt;ref name="aecen.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="devi"/&gt;

{{for|the application software|Adobe Digital Editions}}
A '''digital edition''' is an [[online magazine]] or [[online newspaper]] delivered in electronic form which is formatted identically to the print version. Digital editions are often called digital facsimiles to underline the likeness to the print version. Digital editions have the benefit of reduced cost to the publisher and reader by avoiding the time and the expense to print and deliver paper edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/reading-green-on-demand/|title=Reading Green On Demand|last=Kanter|first=James|publisher=New York Times | date=2008-12-02 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This format is considered more environmentally friendly due to the reduction of paper and energy use.  These editions also often feature interactive elements such as [[hyperlink]]s both within the publication itself and to other internet resources, search option and bookmarking, and can also incorporate multimedia such as video or animation to enhance articles themselves or for advertisement purposes. Some delivery methods also include animation and sound effects that replicate turning of the page to further enhance the experience of their print counterparts.Traditionally, magazine publishers have relied on two revenue sources: selling ads and selling magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rorybrown.wordpress.com/2008/12/01/digital-editions-trying-to-solve-the-wrong-business-media-problem/|title=Digital editions: trying to solve the wrong business media problem|accessdate=2009-05-14|date=2008-01-12|publisher=Rory Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally some publishers are using other electronic publication methods such as [[RSS]] to reach out to readers and inform them when new digital editions are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hawaiireporter.com/story.aspx?ed92812b-bf9f-4872-af4d-e16e267d431e |title=The Future of Newspapers: Moving Beyond Dead Trees |last=Murdoch |first=Rupert |date=2008-11-19 |publisher=Hawaii Reporter |accessdate=2008-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216015103/http://hawaiireporter.com/story.aspx?ed92812b-bf9f-4872-af4d-e16e267d431e |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current technologies are generally either reader-based, requiring a download of an application and subsequent download of each edition, or [[Web browser|browser]]-based, often using [[Macromedia Flash]] , requiring no application download (such as [[Adobe Acrobat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | publisher = Magforum
  | title =  Digital magazines: a history
  | url=http://www.magforum.com/digital_history.htm
  | accessdate = 2008-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Some application-based readers allow users to access editions while not connected to internet. Dedicated hardware such as the [[Amazon Kindle]] and the [[iPad]] is also available for reading digital editions of select books, popular national magazines such as [[Time (magazine)|Time]], [[The Atlantic]], and [[Forbes]] and popular national newspapers such as the [[The New York Times|New York Times]], [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]], and [[the Washington Post|Washington Post]]. 

Archives of print newspapers, in some cases dating hundreds of years back, are being digitized and made available online. Google is indexing existing digital archives produced by the newspapers themselves or by third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/bringing-history-online-one-newspaper.html|title=Bringing History Online, One Newspaper at a Time|publisher=Google|accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Newspaper and magazine archival is not new with [[microform]] film formats solving the problem of efficiently storing and preserving. This format, however, lacked accessibility.  Many libraries, especially state libraries in the United States are archiving their collections digitally and converting existing microfilm to digital format. The [[Library of Congress]] provides project planning assistance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/prjplan.html|title=National Digital Library Program Project Checklist|accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] procures funding through grants from its National Digital Newspaper Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/ndnp.html|title=National Digital Newspaper Program|publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital magazines, ezines, e-editions and emags are sometimes referred to as digital editions, however some of these formats are published only in digital format unlike digital editions which replicate a printed edition as well.

== Digital magazines ==

Digital-replica magazines number in thousands—consumer and business publications, house magazines for associations, institutions and corporations – and conversion from print to digital was still increasing as of 2009. 

A 2008 report funded by digital-replica technology providers and auditing agencies counted 1,786 digital-replica editions having more than 7 million circulation among business-to-business publications, of which 230 editions were audited &lt;ref name="The Gilbane Group, Digital Magazine and Newspaper Editions, May 2008"&gt;[http://info.texterity.com/info/2008GilbaneReport#pg1 The Gilbane Group, Digital Magazine and Newspaper Editions, May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The same report counted 1,470 digital-replica editions of consumer magazines having 5.5 million digital circulation, of which 240 editions were audited. These authors estimated that by year end of 2009 there would be 8,000 digital magazines, having a combined distribution of more than 30 million people.

Surveys have shown that, while not all subscribers prefer a digital edition, some do because of the environmental benefit and also because digital magazines are searchable and may easily be passed along or linked to. One such survey funded by a digital publisher reported on inputs from more than 30,000 subscribers to business, consumer and other digital magazines.&lt;ref name="Texterity, Inc., Profile of the Digital Edition Reader, May 2009"&gt;[http://info.texterity.com/info/reader-research/?submit=Click+here+to+View#pg1 Texterity, Inc., Profile of the Digital Edition Reader, May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Digital magazine business models ==
=== Reduced printing and distribution costs ===

The publishers' choice to save by moving some or all subscribers from print to digital is widely accepted.  Oracle magazine, which has 176,000 of its 516,000 subscribers receiving digital according to its June 2009 BPA circulation statement, is said to be the most widely circulated digital edition of a business-to-business publication. Publishers who do this need to choose whether to make some issues all-digital, move some subscribers to digital edition, add some digital-only subscribers, or send all subscribers the digital edition.

=== Paid subscription revenue ===

In 2009, a major consumer magazine, PC magazine, went all-digital, charging an annual subscription fee for its digital-replica edition. &lt;ref name="PC Magazine Goes 100% Digital, November 19, 2008"&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2335009,00.asp PC Magazine Goes 100% Digital, November 19, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many consumer magazines and newspapers are already available in eReader formats that are sold through booksellers. 
=== Sponsorship and advertising revenue ===

Digital editions often carry special "front cover" advertising, or advertising on the email message alerting the subscriber of the digital edition. Publishers also produce special digital-only inserts and [[rich-media]] ads or advertorials.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

=== Designed-for-digital issues ===

Another approach is to fully replace printed issues with digital ones, or to use digital editions for extra issues that would otherwise have to be printed.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

'''Dutch Sign Language''' ({{lang-nl|Nederlandse Gebarentaal}} or '''NGT'''; '''Sign Language of the Netherlands''' or '''SLN''') is the [[sign language]] used by deaf people in the [[Netherlands]] and is not [[Recognition of sign languages|officially recognized]]. As of 1995, more and more schools for the deaf in The Netherlands teach [[Signed Dutch]] (''Nederlands met Gebaren''). This uses the grammar of Dutch rather than NGT.

NGT is not the same as [[Flemish Sign Language]], and may not even be related to it.

==Education==
There are currently five schools for deaf children in the country, with the first being built at the end of the 18th century and the rest between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. While the first school used a manual method to teach the language, signing was originally prohibited in each of the latter schools and they instead tended to use an oral method of teaching. Today, because of [[cochlear implants]], education is consistently leaning towards oralist methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64025">The '''economic policy of the George W. Bush administration''' was characterized by significant income tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, the implementation of [[Medicare Part D]] in 2003, increased military spending for two wars, a housing bubble that contributed to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] of 2007–2008, and the [[Great Recession]] that followed. Economic performance during the period was adversely affected by two recessions, in 2001 and 2007–2009.

==Overview==
[[File:Presidential Comparison Real GDP - v1.png|thumb|right|450px|U.S. cumulative real (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth by President.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1 FRED-Real GDP-Retrieved July 1, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
President Bush was in office January 2001-January 2009, a complex and challenging economic and budgetary time. In addition to two recessions (2001 and the [[Great Recession]] of 2007-2009), the U.S. faced a housing bubble and bust, two wars, and the rise of Asian competitors, mainly China, which entered the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in December 2001. 
 
During his first term (2001–2004), President Bush sought and obtained Congressional approval for the [[Bush tax cuts]], which mainly comprised the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]] (EGTRRA) and the [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003]] (JGTRRA). These acts decreased many income tax rates, reduced the capital gains tax, increased the [[child tax credit]] and eliminated the so-called "marriage penalty", and were set to expire in 2010, while increasing federal deficits by an estimated 1.5% to 2.0% GDP each year.&lt;ref name=CBO_2009/&gt; Among the many stated rationales for the large income tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 was the 2001 recession, which followed the bursting of the [[Dot-com bubble]] in late 2000 and early 2001. Further, some influential conservatives such as [[Alan Greenspan]] believed that the nearly $5 trillion in budget surpluses forecast by the CBO for the 2002-2011 period should be given back to taxpayers rather than used to pay down the national debt.

The U.S. responded the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] with the [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|invasion of Afghanistan]] shortly thereafter. The [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] followed in 2003. Military expenditures approximately doubled in nominal dollars to pay for these wars, rising from around $300 billion in 2001 to $600 billion in 2008.

While President Bush generally continued the [[Deregulation|deregulatory]] approach of his predecessor President Clinton, an important exception was the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] of 2002, which followed high-profile corporate scandals at [[Enron]], [[World Com]], and [[Tyco International]], among others. It required auditors to be more independent of the firms they audit, corporations to rigorously test their financial reporting controls, and top executives to attest to the accuracy of corporate financial statements, among many other measures.

Regarding entitlement programs, President Bush signed [[Medicare Part D]] into law in 2003, significantly expanding that program, although without new sources of tax revenue. However, an attempt to privatize the Social Security program was unsuccessful in his second term.

His second term (2005-2008) was characterized by the housing bubble peak and bust, followed by the worsening [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and [[Great Recession]]. Responses to the crisis included the $700 billion [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|TARP program]] to bailout damaged financial institutions, loans to help bailout the [[Automotive industry crisis of 2008–10|auto industry crisis]], and bank debt [[Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program|guarantees]]. The vast majority of these funds were later recovered, as banks and auto companies paid back the government.

Economic performance overall suffered as a result of the 2001 and 2007-2009 recessions. Real GDP growth averaged a mediocre 1.8% from Q1 2001 to Q4 2008.&lt;ref name=FRED_RealGDP&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=343360&amp;category_id=|title=FRED Real GDP|website=FRED|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Job creation averaged 95,000 private sector jobs per month,&lt;ref name=FRED_Payems&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS|title=FRED Total Nonfarm Payrolls|website=FRED|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured from February 2001 to January 2009, the least of any President since 1970. Job creation during the 2001-2007 period was slow by historical standards and arguably unsustainable, as nearly all the net job creation was reversed during the subsequent [[Great Recession]]. The employment recoveries from both the 2001 and 2007-2009 recessions were protracted; the peak employment level for private sector workers in January 2008 was not regained until 2014. Income inequality continued to worsen pre-tax (a trend since 1980) and was accelerated after-tax by the Bush tax cuts, which dis-proportionally benefited higher-income taxpayers who pay the majority of income taxes.

The [[U.S. national debt]] grew significantly from 2001 to 2009, both in dollar terms and relative to the size of the economy (GDP), due to a combination of tax cuts, wars and recessions. Measured for fiscal years 2001-2008, Federal spending under President Bush averaged 19.0% of GDP, just below his predecessor President [[Bill Clinton]] at 19.2% GDP, although tax receipts were substantially lower at 17.1% GDP versus 18.4% GDP. Income tax revenues averaged 7.7% GDP under Bush, versus 8.5% GDP under Clinton.&lt;ref name="CBO Historical Tables"/&gt; The sizable national debt increases during his Administration represented a reversal from a sizable surplus projection by the Congressional Budget Office just prior to his taking office.&lt;ref name=CBO_Change2012/&gt;

As of 2017, a major legacy of President Bush's economic policy were his tax cuts, which were [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|extended indefinitely]] by President Obama for roughly the bottom 99% of taxpayers, or about 80% of the value of the tax cuts.

===2001 tax cut===
{{see also|Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001}}
Between 2001 and 2003, the Bush administration instituted a federal tax cut for all taxpayers. Among other changes, the lowest income tax rate decreased from 15% to 10%, the 27% rate went to 25%, the 30% rate went to 28%, the 35% rate went to 33%, and the top marginal tax rate went from 39.6% to 35%.&lt;ref name="Tax Policy Center: Urban Institute and Brookings Institution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=213|title=Tax Policy Center: Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. (March 13, 2007). ''Tax Facts: Historical Top Tax Rate''.|accessdate=2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the child tax credit went from $500 to $1000, and the "[[marriage penalty]]" reduced. Since the cuts got implemented as part of the annual congressional budget resolution, which protected the bill from filibusters, numerous amendments, and more than 20 hours of debate, it had to include a sunset clause. Unless congress passed legislation making the tax cuts permanent, they were to expire after the 2010 tax year.

Facing opposition in Congress for an initially proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut (over ten years),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0102/05/se.01.html|title=Bush Touts $1.6 trillion Tax Cut|accessdate=2008-09-29|date=2001-02-01|work=CNN.com|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.|location=Atlanta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush held town hall-style public meetings across the nation in 2001 to increase public support for it. Bush and some of his economic advisers argued that unspent government funds had to be returned to taxpayers. With reports of the threat of recession, Federal Reserve Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] said tax cuts could work but must be offset with spending cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,296930,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Alan Greenspan Bashes President Bush in New Book | date=2007-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush argued that such a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs. Ultimately, five Senate Democrats crossed party lines to join Republicans in approving a $1.35 trillion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===2003 cuts and later===
{{see also|Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003}}

The [[United States Congress]] passed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA) on May 23, 2003 and [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] signed it into law five days later. Nearly all of the cuts (individual rates, capital gains, dividends, estate tax) were to expire after 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=6621 | title=Tax Policy Under President Bush | publisher=Cato Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other provisions, the act accelerated certain tax changes passed in the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]], increased the exemption amount for the individual [[Alternative Minimum Tax]], and lowered taxes of [[income]] from [[dividend]]s and [[capital gain]]s. JGTRRA continued on the precedent established by the 2001 EGTRRA, while increasing tax reductions on investment income from [[dividend]]s and [[capital gain]]s. JGTRRA accelerated the gradual rate reduction and increase in credits passed in EGTRRA. The maximum tax rate decreases originally scheduled to be phased into effect in 2006 under EGTRRA were retroactively enacted to apply to the 2003 tax year. Also, the child tax credit increased to what would have been the 2010 level, and "[[marriage penalty]]" relief accelerated to 2009 levels. In addition, the threshold at which the [[alternative minimum tax]] applies was also increased. JGTRRA increased both the percentage rate at which items are [[depreciation|depreciated]] and the amount a taxpayer may choose to expense under [[Section 179]], allowing them to deduct the full cost of the item from their income without having to depreciate the amount.

In addition, the [[capital gains tax in the United States|capital gains tax]] decreased from rates of 8%, 10%, and 20% to 5% and 15%. Capital gains taxes for those currently paying 5% (in this instance, those in the 10% and 15% income tax brackets) are scheduled for elimination in 2008. However, capital gains taxes remain at the regular income tax rate for property held less than one year. Certain categories, such as collectibles, remained taxed at existing rates, with a 28% cap. In addition, taxes on "[[qualified dividend]]s" reduced to the capital gains levels. "[[Qualified dividend]]s" includes most income from non-foreign corporations, [[real estate investment trust]]s, and [[credit union]] and [[bank]] "dividends" nominally [[interest]].

===CBO scoring===
The non-partisan [[Congressional Budget Office]] has consistently reported that the [[Bush tax cuts]] (EGTRRA and JGTRRA) did not pay for themselves and represented a sizable decline in revenue for the Treasury:
*The CBO estimated in June 2012 that the Bush tax cuts of 2001 (EGTRRA) and 2003 (JGTRRA) added approximately $1.5 trillion total to the debt over the 2002-2011 decade, excluding interest.&lt;ref name=CBO_Change2012&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41463|title=CBO Changes in CBO's Baseline Projections Since January 2001|website=CBO|date=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The CBO estimated in January 2009 that the Bush tax cuts would add approximately $3.0 trillion to the debt over the 2010-2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels, including interest.&lt;ref name=CBO_2009&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41753|title=CBO Budget and Economic Outlook 2009–2019|website=CBO|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The CBO estimated in January 2009 that extending the Bush tax cuts at all income levels over the 2011-2019 period would increase the annual deficit by an average of 1.7% GDP, reaching 2.0% GDP in 2018 and 2019.&lt;ref name=CBO_2009/&gt;

===Commentary on the Bush tax cuts===
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt said the middle class will not benefit enough from the tax cut and the wealthy will reap unfairly high benefits. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle argued that the tax cut is too large, too generous to the rich and too expensive.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Kelly (June 7, 2001). "$1.35 trillion tax cut becomes law". CNN InsidePolitics archives. Retrieved December 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economist#United States|Economists]], including the [[Treasury Secretary]] at the time [[Paul O'Neill (businessman)|Paul O'Neill]] and 450 economists, including ten [[Nobel prize]] laureates, who contacted Bush in 2003, opposed the 2003 tax cuts on the grounds that they would fail as a growth stimulus, increase inequality and worsen the budget outlook considerably (see [[Economists' statement opposing the Bush tax cuts]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article5510.htm |title=CBS Interviews Former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill] |accessdate=2007-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081611/http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article5510.htm |archivedate=2006-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argued the effects of the tax cuts have been as promised as revenues actually increased (although income tax revenues fell), the recession of 2001 ended relatively quickly, and economic growth was positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/11/25/news/economy/gdp/ | work=CNN | title=U.S. economic growth revised up | date=2003-11-25 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax cuts had been largely opposed by American economists, including the Bush administration's own Economic Advisement Council.&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; In 2003, 450 economists, including ten Nobel Prize laureate, signed the [[Economists' statement opposing the Bush tax cuts]], sent to President Bush stating that "these tax cuts will worsen the long-term budget outlook... will reduce the capacity of the government to finance Social Security and Medicare benefits as well as investments in schools, health, infrastructure, and basic research... [and] generate further inequalities in after-tax income."&lt;ref name="Economists' statement opposing the Bush tax cuts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epi.org/stmt/2003/statement_signed.pdf|title=4.

The Bush administration had claimed, based on the concept of the [[Laffer Curve]], that the tax cuts actually paid for the themselves by generating enough extra revenue from additional economic growth to offset the lower taxation rates. However, income tax revenues in dollar terms did not regain their FY 2000 peak until 2006. Through the end of 2008, total federal tax revenues relative to GDP had yet to regain their 2000 peak.&lt;ref name="CBO Historical Tables"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/budget/data/historical.pdf |title=CBO Historical Tables |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked whether the Bush tax cuts had generated more revenue, Laffer stated that he did not know. However, he did say that the tax cuts were "what was right," because after the September 11 attacks and threats of recession, Bush "needed to stimulate the economy and spend for defense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1692027,00.html|title=Tax Cuts Don't Boost Revenues|accessdate=2007-12-07 |author=Justin Fox |date=2007-12-06 |work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics indicate that the tax revenues would have been considerably higher if the tax cuts had not been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/05/AR2007010501801.html |title=A Heckuva Claim |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2007-01-06 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/14/AR2006051400806.html |title=Sebastian Mallaby - The Return Of Voodoo Economics |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2006-05-15|accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Income tax revenues in dollar terms did not regain their FY 2000 peak until 2006.&lt;ref name="CBO Historical Tables"/&gt; The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) has estimated that extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts (which were scheduled to expire in 2010) would cost the U.S. Treasury nearly $1.8 trillion in the following decade, dramatically increasing federal deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/78xx/doc7878/03-21-PresidentsBudget.pdf |title=An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals for Fiscal Year 2008| page= 6 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tax Policy Center reported that the various tax cuts under the Bush administration were "extraordinarily expensive" to the Treasury:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tax Policy Center |url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/background/bush-tax-cuts/size.cfm |title=Tax Policy Center-Briefing Book 2008 |publisher=Taxpolicycenter.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811012325/http://taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/background/bush-tax-cuts/size.cfm |archivedate=2011-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation calculated a score, or revenue change, for each of the seven major tax cut bills passed during the Bush administration: their combined cost sums to over $2.0 trillion from 2001 to 2017. Extending these tax cuts into the future would carry a similar cost: the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently estimated the cost of extending them through 2017 at $1.9 trillion, not counting the costs of debt service, and not counting the cost of indexing the alternative minimum tax (AMT) to inflation to prevent it from undoing much of the cuts...if one takes into account the direct effects of the tax cuts, extra interest payments, and the extra "interaction" cost of reforming the AMT while extending the Bush tax cuts, the combined cost of extending the tax cuts through 2017 adds up to $2.8 trillion.}}

===Impact on inequality===
Federal income taxes (distinct from payroll taxes) are paid overwhelmingly by the highest income taxpayers. For example, in 2014 the top 1% of income earners paid 45.7% of federal income taxes; the bottom 80% of earners paid 15%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/13/top-1-pay-nearly-half-of-federal-income-taxes.html CNBC-Robert Frank-Top 1% pay nearly half of federal income taxes-April 14, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, policies that reduce income tax rates, such as the Bush tax cuts, dis-proportionally benefit the rich, as they pay the lion's share of the taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/research/distributional-effects-of-the-2001-and-2003-tax-cuts-how-do-financing-and-behavioral-responses-matter/ Brookings-Gale, Elmendorf, Furman, Harris-Distributional Effects of the 2001 and 2003 Tax Cuts-June 30, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; During President Bush's terms, [[Income inequality in the United States|income inequality]] grew, a trend since 1980. CBO reported that the share of after-tax income received by the top 1% rose from 12.3% in 2001 to a peak of 16.7% in 2007, before ending at 14.1% in 2008. Comparing 2001 and 2008, the lowest and highest [[quintiles]] of the income distribution had a larger share of the after-tax income, while the middle three quintiles had a lower share.&lt;ref name=CBO_IE2016&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51361|title=CBO The Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes, 2013|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, income inequality can be measured both before-tax and after-tax, so the Bush tax cuts primarily impacted the latter measurements. President Bush did not take deliberate steps to address pre-tax inequality, which involves policies such as raising the minimum wage, strengthening collective bargaining power (unions), limiting executive pay, and protectionism. CBO reported that the top 1% paid an average total federal tax rate of 32.5% in 2000, 30.1% in 2004, and 28.2% in 2008. The top 1% paid an average federal income tax rate of 24.5% in 2000 and 20.4% in 2008.&lt;ref name=CBO_IE2016&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51361|title=CBO The Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes, 2013|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of increasing inequality, the effect of Bush's tax cuts on the upper, middle and lower class is contentious. Some economists argue that the cuts have benefited the nation's richest households at the expense of the middle and lower class,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/08/washington/08tax.html?ei=5088&amp;en=e1dc830d58c7eacb&amp;ex=1325912400&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1168290792-GR0HodSCCzDHPWdgiU8nlg |title = Tax Cuts Offer Most for Very Rich, Study Says

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists [[Peter Orszag]] and [[William G. Gale|William Gale]] described the Bush tax cuts as reverse government redistribution of wealth, "[shifting] the burden of taxation away from upper-income, capital-owning households and toward the wage-earning households of the lower and middle classes."&lt;ref name="Gale &amp; Orzsag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/articles/2005/0504taxes_gale.aspx|title=Gale, G.

This would suggest that the Bush tax cut policy was highly regressive, but some writers, notably at the Koch-funded [[Tax Foundation]], argue that the concept of a [[progressive tax]] should be detached from its traditional association with income redistribution,&lt;ref name="Tax Progressivity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/blog/show/22537.html|title=The Tax Foundation (August, 2007).

Between 2003 and 2004, following the 2003 tax cuts, the share of after-tax income going to the top 1% rose from 12.2% in 2003 to 14.0% in 2004. (This followed the period from 2000 to 2002, where after-tax incomes declined the most for the top 1%.)&lt;ref name="Aron-Dine &amp; Sherman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbpp.org/1-23-07inc.htm|title=Aron-Dine, A. &amp; Sherman, R.

==Defense spending==
[[File:U.S. Defense Spending Trends 2001-2014.png|thumb|right|350px|Defense Spending 2001–2017.]]
{{See|Financial cost of the Iraq War}}

Defense spending increased from $306 billion in 2001 (2.9% GDP) to $612 billion in 2008 (4.2% GDP). The invasion of Afghanistan following the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center in 2001, along with the 2003 invasion of Iraq, added significantly to defense spending. The [[Congressional Research Service]] estimated that Congress approved $1.6 trillion during the FY2001-FY2014 periods for "military operations, base support, weapons maintenance, training of Afghan and Iraq security forces, reconstruction, foreign aid, embassy costs, and veterans’ health care for the war operations initiated since the 9/11 attacks." Roughly half this amount, $803 billion, was approved for the FY2001-2008 period of the Bush administration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf Congressional Research Service-The Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Other Global WOT Operations Since 9/11-December 8, 2014-See Table 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

This spending was incremental to the "base" Department of Defense budget, which also increased faster than inflation during the period. The Comptroller of the Department of Defense (DOD) estimated spending for "Overseas Contingency Operations" (OCO), analogous to the CRS amount above, at $748 billion for the 2001-2008 period. This was incremental to the "base" DOD budget, which totaled $3.1 trillion during the 2001-2008 period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2017/FY2017_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf Comptroller of the DOD-Defense Budget Overview FY2017 Budget Request-See Figure 1-2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other estimates define the cost of the Iraq war alone over time as considerably higher. For example, Nobel laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]] has estimated the total cost of the Iraq War at closer to $3 trillion, considering the long-term care for military personnel, equipment replacement, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stiglitz |first=Joseph E. |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87801279 |title=NPR-Stiglitz Interview |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Budget deficit and national debt==
[[File:U.S. Federal budget actual versus forecast 2000-2011.png|thumb|350px|right|Image compares the CBO January 2001 surplus baseline forecast for the 2002-2011 period versus the actual deficit amounts.]]
The U.S. fiscal position changed dramatically for the worse during the Bush years. CBO projected in its January 2001 baseline that the U.S. would have a total of $5.6 trillion in annual ''surpluses'' over the 2002-2011 decade, assuming the laws in place during the Clinton era continued and the economy performed as expected. However, the actual ''deficits'' during those years ended up being $6.1 trillion, a negative swing of $11.7 trillion. Two recessions, two wars, and tax cuts were the primary drivers of the differences.&lt;ref name=CBO_Change2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbpp.org/research/economic-downturn-and-legacy-of-bush-policies-continue-to-drive-large-deficits Center on Budget and Policy Priorities-Economic Downturn and Legacy of Bush Policies Continue to Drive Large Deficits-February 28, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his two terms (2001-2008), President Bush averaged 19.0% GDP spending, slightly below the 19.2% GDP spending under Clinton (1993-2000). However, revenues of 17.1% GDP were 1.3% GDP below the 18.4% GDP average during the Clinton era.&lt;ref name="CBO Historical Tables"/&gt; Further, CBO had forecast in 2001 that revenues would average 20.4% GDP during the 2001-2008 period (above the FY2000 record of 20.0% GDP), while spending would average 16.9% GDP and be on a downward trend, very low by historical standards.&lt;ref name=CBO_2001&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/12958 CBO-Budget &amp; Economic Outlook 2002-2011-January 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

CBO reported that debt held by the public, a partial measure of the national debt, rose from $3.41 trillion in 2000 (33.6% GDP) to $5.80 trillion in 2008 (39.3% GDP). However, CBO had forecast in 2001 that debt held by the public would fall to $1.0 trillion by 2008 (7.1% GDP).&lt;ref name=CBO_2001/&gt;

Interest on the debt (including both public and intragovernmental amounts) increased from $322 billion to $454 billion annually. The share of public debt owned by foreigners increased significantly from 31% in June 2001 to 50% in June 2008, with the dollar balance owed to foreigners increasing from $1.0 trillion to $2.6 trillion. This also significantly increased the interest payments sent overseas, from approximately $50 billion in 2001 to $121 billion during 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/feddebt/feddebt_ann2008.pdf |title=GAO on BPD Federal Debt Schedules|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the debt increase over the 2001-2005 period was accumulated as a result of tax cuts and increased national security spending. According to Richard Kogan and Matt Fiedler, "the largest costs — $1.2 trillion over six years — resulted from the tax cuts enacted since the start of 2001. Increased spending for defense, international affairs, and homeland security – primarily for prosecuting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – also was quite costly, amounting to almost $800 billion to date. Together, tax cuts and the spending increases for these security programs account for 84 percent of the increases in debt racked up by Congress and the President over this period."&lt;ref name="Fiedler &amp; Kogan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbpp.org/12-13-06bud.htm|title=Fiedler, M. &amp; Kogan, R.

Sure, that’s a lot of money. But the total cost works out to 1 percent of the $63 trillion GDP over that time period. It's [[wikt:miniscule|miniscule]] [sic]." He also reported that "during the five years of the Iraq war,. . .household net worth has increased by $20 trillion." &lt;ref name=Kudlow&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YzYzY2JiYzU2Yjc3MjY5MTgyZjJiOGQ1ZjM5MmI3Yzc=|title=Kudlow, Lawrence (April 14, 2008). "What Price Freedom?"|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the budget legacy passed to his successor President Obama, CBO forecast in January 2009 that the deficit that year would be $1.2 trillion, assuming the continuation of Bush policies.&lt;ref name=CBO_2009&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41753|title=CBO Budget and Economic Outlook 2009–2019|website=CBO|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a policy perspective, the long-term deficit legacy depended significantly on whether the Bush tax cuts were allowed to expire in 2010 as initially legislated. President Obama extended the Bush tax cuts entirely through the end of 2012 as part of the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010|2010 Tax Relief Act]], then extended them for the bottom 99% of income earners indefinitely thereafter as part of the [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]] resolution, roughly 80% of the dollar value of the cuts.

President Bush also signed into law [[Medicare Part D]], which provides additional prescription drug benefits to seniors. The program was not funded by any changes to the tax code. According to the [[GAO]], this program alone created $8.4 trillion in unfunded obligations in present value terms, a larger fiscal challenge than Social Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/cghome/d08446cg.pdf |title=GAO-08-446CG U.S. Financial Condition and Fiscal Future Briefing, presented by the Honorable David M.

==Trade policy==

[[File:U.S. Trade Deficit Dollars and % GDP.png|thumb|350px|right|U.S. Current Account or Trade Deficit.]]
The Bush administration generally pursued [[free trade]] policies. China entered the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in late 2001. Bush used the authority he gained from the [[Trade Act of 2002]] to push through bilateral trade agreements with several countries. Bush also sought to expand multilateral trade agreements through the WTO, but negotiations were stalled in the [[Doha Development Round]] for most of Bush's presidency.

The sizable decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs since 2000 has been blamed on various causes, such as trade with a rising Asia, offshoring of jobs with few restrictions to lower wage countries, innovation in global [[supply chains]] (e.g., [[containerization]]), and other technology improvements. The millions of construction jobs created during the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] that peaked in 2006 helped mask some of this adverse employment impact initially. Further, households dramatically increased their debt burden from 2001-2007, extracting home equity for use in consumption. However, the housing bubble collapse in 2006-2008 contributed to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and resulting [[Great Recession]], which resulted in households switching from adding debt to paying it down, a headwind to the economy for several years thereafter.

Developing countries blamed the US and the EU for stagnated negotiations since both maintain [[protectionist]] policies [[agricultural subsidies|in agriculture]]. While generally favoring free trade, Bush has also occasionally supported protectionist measures, notably the [[2002 United States steel tariff]] early in his term. Bush also implemented a 300% tax on Roquefort cheese from France in retaliation for a European Union ban on hormone-treated beef common in the American beef industry.&lt;ref&gt;"US roquefort tariff angers French." https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/17/france-america-import-tariffs&lt;/ref&gt;

George W. Bush successfully gained ratification of the [[Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (DR-CAFTA). Supporters of DR-CAFTA claim it has been a success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/article/SB117245928831919032-search.html?KEYWORDS=cafta&amp;COLLECTION=wsjie/6month | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817132506/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB117245928831919032-search.html?KEYWORDS=cafta&amp;COLLECTION=wsjie%2F6month | archive-date=2009-08-17 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=One Year After Cafta | date=2007-02-26 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but detractors still oppose the agreement for a variety of reasons including its impact on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/trade/cafta/cafta_centralamerica.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517075933/http://www.sierraclub.org/trade/cafta/cafta_centralamerica.asp |archivedate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Ben Bernanke]] addressed the implications of the USA's high and rising [[current account]] (trade) deficit, resulting from USA imports exceeding its exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050414/default.htm |title=Bernanke-The Global Saving Glut and U.S. Current Account Deficit |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1996 and 2006, the USA current account deficit increased to a record of nearly 6% of GDP. Financing the trade deficit required the USA to borrow large sums from abroad, much of it from countries running trade surpluses, mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations. A significant portion of this borrowing was directed by large financial institutions into [[mortgage-backed securities]] and their derivatives, a factor that contributed to the housing bubble and the crises that followed. The trade deficit peaked in 2006 along with housing prices.&lt;ref name=NPR_Giant&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Giant Pool of Money | url= http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=355|series=[[This American Life]] |airdate=2008-05-09 |number=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts to reform Social Security==
{{main|Social Security debate (United States)}}

President Bush advocated the partial privatization of Social Security in 2005-2006, but was unsuccessful in achieving any reforms to the program against strong congressional resistance. His proposal would have diverted some of the payroll tax revenues that fund the program into private accounts. Critics argued that privatizing Social Security does nothing to address the long-term funding challenge facing the program. Diverting funds to private accounts would reduce available funds to pay current retirees, requiring significant borrowing. An analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that President Bush's 2005 privatization proposal would have added $1 trillion in new federal debt in its first decade of implementation and $3.5 trillion in the decade thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcf.org/Publications/RetirementSecurity/12badideas.pdf |title=Twelve Reasons Privatizing Social Security is a Bad Idea-Reason 3 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325214633/http://www.tcf.org/Publications/RetirementSecurity/12badideas.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2016 Social Security Administration Trustees Report, payments will be cut by 23% under current law around 2035, if no reforms are made to the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2016/index.html|title=Social Security Trustees Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory philosophy==
[[File:Leverage ratios for major investment banks.svg|thumb|300px|Leverage ratios of investment banks increased significantly between 2003 and 2007.]]

President Bush advocated the [[Ownership society]], premised on the concepts of individual accountability, smaller government, and the owning of property. Critics have argued this contributed to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], by encouraging home ownership for those unable to afford them and insufficient regulation of financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/meltdown/interviews/krugman.html |title=Krugman Interview |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of [[economic regulation]] governmental workers was increased by 91,196, whereas [[Bill Clinton]] had cut down the number by 969.&lt;ref name="bushregulation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bush's Regulatory Kiss-Off - Obama's assertions to the contrary, the 43rd president was the biggest regulator since Nixon.|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/130328.html|publisher=Reason magazine|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarbanes-Oxley Act===
President Bush signed the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] into law during July 2002, which he called "the most far-reaching reforms of American business practices since the time of Franklin Delano Roosevelt." The law was passed in the wake of several corporate scandals and widespread stock market losses. The law addressed conflicts of interest between accounting firms and the corporations they audit and required executives to certify the accuracy of the corporation's financial statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/31/business/corporate-conduct-the-president-bush-signs-bill-aimed-at-fraud-in-corporations.html | work=The New York Times | title=CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE PRESIDENT; Bush Signs Bill Aimed at Fraud In Corporations | first=Elisabeth | last=Bumiller | date=2002-07-31 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law has been controversial, with some advocating its positive effect on investor confidence and detractors citing its significant cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Farrell |first=Greg |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/regulation/2007-07-29-sarbanes-oxley_N.htm |title=USA Today-Sarbox |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2007-07-30 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac===
In 2003, the Bush Administration attempted to create an agency to oversee [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]]. The bill never made progress in Congress, facing sharp opposition by Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E3D6123BF932A2575AC0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Labaton | accessdate=2010-05-01 | title=New Agency Proposed to Oversee Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae | date=2003-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Republican controlled House of Representatives passed a GSE reform bill (Federal Housing Finance Reform Act) which "would have created a stronger regulator with new powers to increase capital at Fannie and Freddie, to limit their portfolios and to deal with the possibility of receivership".&lt;ref name="Farrell"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8780c35e-7e91-11dd-b1af-000077b07658.html#axzz1hnrckSB6 | work=The Financial Times | first=Greg | last=Farrell | title=Oxley Hits Back At Ideologues | date=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bush administration opposed the bill and it died in the Senate. Of the bill and its reception by the Bush White House, Ohio Republican Mike Oxley (the bill's author) said: "The critics have forgotten that the House passed a GSE reform bill in 2005 that could well have prevented the current crisis. All the handwringing and bedwetting is going on without remembering how the House stepped up on this. What did we get from the White House? We got a one-finger salute." &lt;ref name="Farrell"/&gt; The Bush economic policy regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac changed during the economic downturn of 2008, culminating in the federal takeover of the two largest lenders in the mortgage market. Further economic challenges have resulted in the Bush administration attempting an economic intervention, through a requested $700 billion bailout package for Wall Street investment houses.

===Regulation of the financial sector===

President Bush and his economic experts did not adequately address fundamental changes in the banking sector which had taken place over the two decades prior to the crisis. The essentially unregulated [[shadow banking]] system (e.g., investment banks, mortgage companies, money market mutual funds, etc.) had grown to rival the traditional, regulated depository banking system but without equivalent safeguards. Nobel laureate [[Paul Krugman]] described the run on the [[shadow banking system]] as the "core of what happened" to cause the crisis. "As the shadow banking system expanded to rival or even surpass conventional banking in importance, politicians and government officials should have realized that they were re-creating the kind of financial vulnerability that made the Great Depression possible—and they should have responded by extending regulations and the financial safety net to cover these new institutions. Influential figures should have proclaimed a simple rule: anything that does what a bank does, anything that has to be rescued in crises the way banks are, should be regulated like a bank." He referred to this lack of controls as "malign neglect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

President Bush stated in September 2008: "Once this crisis is resolved, there will be time to update our financial regulatory structures. Our 21st century global economy remains regulated largely by outdated 20th century laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/09/20080924-10.html|title=President's Address to the Nation September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and [[Alan Greenspan]] conceded failure in allowing the self-regulation of investment banks, which proceeded to take on increasingly risky bets and [[financial leverage|leverage]] after a key 2004 decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/business/27sec.html?em|title=SEC Concedes Oversight Flaws | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Labaton | date=2008-09-27 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html?em|title=The Reckoning | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Labaton | date=2008-10-03 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Subprime mortgage crisis|Great Recession}}
The last year of Bush's second term was dominated by the [[Great Recession]]. GDP declined in the 1st, 3rd, and 4th quarters of 2008 by -2.7%, -1.9% and -8.2%, respectively. The recession officially lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, with the economy returning to consistent growth in Q3 2009,&lt;ref name=FRED_RealGDP&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=343360&amp;category_id=|title=FRED Real GDP|website=FRED|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although civilian employment did not return to its December 2007 peak until September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=351545&amp;updated=9996 FRED-Civilian Employment Level-Retrieved January 18, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fed chair [[Ben Bernanke]] explained in 2010 that vulnerabilities in the global financial system built up over a long period of time, and then specific triggering events set the 2007-2008 [[subprime mortgage crisis]] into motion. For example, vulnerabilities included failure to regulate the risk-taking of the non-depository banking sector, the so-called [[shadow banks]] such as investment banks and mortgage companies. These companies had outgrown the regulated depository banking sector, but did not have the same safeguards. Further, financial connections were established between the depository banks and shadow banks (e.g., via [[securitization]] and [[special purpose entities]]) that created dependencies that were not well understood by regulators. Certain types of derivatives, essentially bets on the performance of other securities, remained largely unregulated and were another opaque source of dependencies.&lt;ref name=Bernanke_Causes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100902a.htm |title=FCIC Testimony-Causes of the Recent Financial and Economic Crisis|author=Ben Bernanke|date=September 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernanke further explained that specific triggering events began in mid-2007, as investors began to withdraw funds from the shadow banking system, analogous to depositors withdrawing money from depository banks in past bank runs. Investors became unsure of the value of the securities (loan collateral) held by the shadow banks, as many derived their value from subprime mortgages.  Mortgage companies could no longer borrow money to originate mortgages, and many failed in 2007. The crisis accelerated in 2008, as the largest five U.S. investment banks, which had $4 trillion in liabilities by the end of 2007, could no longer obtain financing. They had grown increasingly dependent on short-term sources of financing (e.g., [[repurchase agreements]]), and were unable to obtain new funding from investors. These investment banks were forced to sell long-term securities at fire-sale prices to meet their daily financing needs, suffering enormous losses. Concerns about the possible failure of these banks led the financial system to essentially freeze by September 2008. The Federal Reserve increasingly intervened in its role as lender of last resort to stabilize the financial system as the crisis deepened.&lt;ref name=Bernanke_Causes/&gt;

Bush responded to the early signs of economic problems with lump-sum tax rebates and other stimulative measures in the [[Economic Stimulus Act of 2008]]. In March 2008, [[Bear Stearns]], a major US [[investment bank]] heavily invested in subprime mortgage derivatives, began to go under. Rumors of low cash reserves dragged Bear's stock price down while lenders to Bear began to withdraw their cash. The Federal Reserve funneled an emergency loan to Bear through [[JP Morgan Chase]]. (As an investment bank, Bear could not borrow from the Fed but JP Morgan Chase, a commercial bank, could).

The Fed ended up brokering an agreement for the sale of Bear to JP Morgan Chase that took place at the end of March. In July, [[IndyMac]] went under and had to be placed in [[conservatorship]]. In the middle of the summer it seemed like recession might be avoided even though high gas prices threatened consumers and credit problems threatened investment markets, but the economy entered crisis in the fall. [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] were also put under [[conservatorship]] in early September.

A few days later, [[Lehman Brothers]] began to falter. Treasury Secretary [[Hank Paulson]], who in July had publicly expressed concern that continuous bailouts would lead to [[moral hazard]], decided to let Lehman fail. The fallout from Lehman's failure snowballed into market-wide panic. [[AIG]], an insurance company, had sold [[credit default swaps]] insuring against Lehman's failure under the assumption that such a failure was extremely unlikely.

Without enough cash to pay out its Lehman-related debts, AIG went under and was nationalized. Credit markets locked up and catastrophe seemed all too likely. Paulson proposed providing liquidity to financial markets by having the government buy up debt related to bad mortgages with a $700 billion [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]]. Congressional Democrats advocated an alternative policy of investing in financial companies directly. Congress passed the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]], which authorized both policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usbudgetwatch.org/stimulus |title=Stimulus Watch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307183334/http://www.usbudgetwatch.org/stimulus |archivedate=2009-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the crisis, Bush seemed to defer to Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman [[Ben Bernanke]]. He kept a low public profile on the issue with his most significant role being a public television address where he announced that a bailout was necessary otherwise the United States "could experience a long and painful recession." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/public/content/article.aspx?RsrcID=36294 |title=Declaring ‘Entire Economy’ in Danger, Bush Calls Bipartisan Powwow for Biggest Bailout Ever |author=Terrence P.

Nearly all of the money paid out for banking bailouts by the Bush administration was in the form of loans that were paid back. For example, as of 2012 the TARP program had paid out $245 billion to banks, while the government got back $267 billion including interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-banks-paid-back-all-federal-bail/ |title=Politifact-Barack Obama says banks paid back all the federal bailout money|author=Jake Berry|date=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overall===
*Economic growth, measured as the change in real GDP versus the prior quarter, averaged 1.8% from Q1 2001 to Q4 2008.  This was slower than the 2.6% average from Q1 1989-Q4 2008.&lt;ref name=FRED_RealGDP&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=343360&amp;category_id=|title=FRED Real GDP|website=FRED|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real GDP grew nearly 3% during President Bush's first term but only 0.5% during his second term. During the Clinton administration, GDP growth was close to 4%.&lt;ref name=Economist_GDP&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21611143-why-economy-has-grown-faster-under-democratic-presidents-timing-everything|title=Why the economy has grown faster under Democratic Presidents|website=The Economist|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant driver of economic growth during the Bush administration was home equity extraction, essentially borrowing against the value of the home to finance personal consumption. Free cash used by consumers from equity extraction doubled from $627 billion in 2001 to $1,428 billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built, nearly $5 trillion dollars over the period. Using the home as a source of funds also reduced the net savings rate significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2007/200720/200720pap.pdf |title=Sources and Uses of Equity Extracted from Homes -Greenspan Kennedy Report - Table 2 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/33336-home-equity-extraction-the-real-cost-of-free-cash |title=Equity extraction - Charts |publisher=Seekingalpha.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSN2330071920070423 |title=Reuters-Spending Boosted by Home Equity Loans |publisher=Reuters.com |date= 2007-04-23|accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Real GDP rose from $12.6 trillion in Q1 2001 to a peak of $15.0 trillion in Q4 2007, before ending at $14.6 trillion, a cumulative increase of $2 trillion or 16%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=272846&amp;rn=4677 FRED-Real GDP-Retrieved January 18, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; A March 2006 report by the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee]] showed that the U.S. economy outperformed its peer group of large developed economies from 2001 to 2005. (The other economies are Canada, the European Union, and Japan.) The U.S. led in real GDP growth, investment, industrial production, employment, labor productivity, and price stability.&lt;ref name="Joint Economic Committee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/jec/studies/rr109-32.pdf|title=Joint Economic Committee (March, 2006).

*The seasonally adjusted [[unemployment]] rate rose from 4.3% in January 2001 to 6.3% in June 2003, then fell as the housing bubble inflated to a trough of 4.4% in March 2007. As the Great Recession deepened, the rate rose again to 6.1% in August 2008 and up to 7.2% in December 2008 at the end of the Bush administration. It peaked at 9.9% in November 2009, early in the Obama administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bls.gov/cps/|title = Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey|publisher = U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate = 2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; From December 2007 when the recession started to December 2008, an additional 3.6 million people became unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm/ |title=Bureau of Labor Statistics |date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Private sector job creation (total non-farm payrolls) was a net negative from February 2001 to January 2005. There were 132.7 million persons employed in the private sector in January 2001; this figure fell to a trough of 130.2 million in August 2003 before steadily rising to a peak of 138.4 million in January 2008 as the housing bubble expanded. It then fell rapidly during the Great Recession, to 134.0 million at the end of his two terms in January 2009. It continued falling thereafter to a trough of 129.7 million in February 2010. January 2001 and March 2009 had roughly the same level of non-farm private sector jobs.&lt;ref name=FRED_Payems/&gt;
*Interest rates remained at moderate levels for most of his two terms, with the 10-year Treasury bond averaging 4.4% yield, compared to 5.8% from Q1 1989-Q4 2008. It finished at 2.4% as the recession deepened.&lt;ref name="FRED_Inflation&amp;Interest"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=215974&amp;category_id=|title=FRED CPI and 10-Year Treasury|website=FRED|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Inflation (measured as CPI for all items) averaged 2.8% during his tenure, similar to the 3.0% average from Q1 1989-Q4 2008, but plunged to zero in late 2008 as the economy entered a deep recession.&lt;ref name="FRED_Inflation&amp;Interest"/&gt;

===Households===
*Household debt grew dramatically during the period to a record level, rising from $7.4 trillion in Q1 2001 to $14.3 trillion in Q4 2008, an increase of $6.9 trillion. Measured as a percent of GDP, it rose from 70% GDP to 99% GDP.&lt;ref name=FRED_HHDebt&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=219975&amp;category_id=|title=Household Debt|website=FRED|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debt addition was a driver of the housing bubble and crises that followed. When housing prices fell, but the value of the mortgage debt generally did not, many homeowners found themselves in a negative equity position (underwater) on their homes, driving a significant housing payment delinquency and foreclosure problem. This caused investors to question the value of mortgage-backed securities held by financial institutions, contributing to the run on the shadow banking system. 
*[[Household income in the United States|Median household income]] has more than kept up with inflation since Bush took control of fiscal policy during the 2001 near-recession, growing 1.6% higher in constant 2007 dollars to $50,233 in 2007 from $49,454 in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/h06ar.html|title=Historical Income Tables - Households|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|year=2007|accessdate=2008-03-22 |archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20081127031415/http%3A//www%2Ecensus%2Egov/hhes/www/income/histinc/h06ar%2Ehtml |archivedate=November 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/p60-235.pdf|title = Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]] rate increased from 11.25% in 2000 to 12.3% in 2006 after peaking at 12.7% in 2004; in 2008 increased to 13.2%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050627001900/http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/histpov/perindex.html U.S. Census Bureau, Historical Poverty Tables], table 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Under 18 years poverty rate increased from 16.2% in 2000 to 18% in 2007; in 2008 rose to 19%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050627001900/http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/histpov/perindex.html U.S. Census Bureau, Historical Poverty Tables], table 3.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000 to 2005, only 4% of workers, typically highly educated professionals, had real income increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheve |first=Kenneth F. |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/62641/kenneth-f-scheve-and-matthew-j-slaughter/a-new-deal-for-globalization |title=Slaughter-A New Deal for Globalization |publisher=Foreignaffairs.com |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*During President Bush's terms, [[Income inequality in the United States|income inequality]] grew. CBO reported that the share of after-tax income received by the top 1% rose from 12.3% in 2001 to a peak of 16.7% in 2007, before ending at 14.1% in 2008. Comparing 2001 and 2008, the lowest and highest quintiles of the income distribution had a larger share of the after-tax income, while the middle three quintiles had a lower share.&lt;ref name=CBO_IE2016&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51361|title=CBO The Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes, 2013|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1919, the [[United States Congress]] proposed a Constitutional amendment reading: "Section 1: The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex." "Section 2: Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."  By July 1920, thirty-five states had [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification|ratified]] the proposal, with only one additional state needed for the Amendment to be adopted.

[[File:Charles S Fairchild - SecofTreasury.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Charles S. Fairchild]] challenged the validity of what was to become the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]].]]
On July 7, 1920, [[Charles S. Fairchild]] challenged the validity of the ratification process for that Amendment in the [[Supreme Court of the District of Columbia]]. The challenge sought to prevent [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Charles Evans Hughes]] from officially declaring the Amendment valid. The district court dismissed the case on July 20, and Fairchild appealed to the [[Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia]]. On August 26, Hughes acknowledged [[Tennessee]]'s ratification, and the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] became law.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court decision. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=Bradeis1978/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGovneyHoward1955"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGovney|first1=Dudley Odell|last2=Howard|first2=Pendleton|title=Cases on constitutional law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MzxDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=13 December 2012|year=1955|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1921, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, which was argued in January 1922.&lt;ref name=Wroth1921/&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
[[File:Brandeisl.jpg|thumb|140px|right|[[Louis Brandeis]] penned the Court's opinion.]]
In February, the Court announced a unanimous decision authored by Associate Justice [[Louis Brandeis]], concluding that Fairchild, as a private citizen, lacked [[standing (law)|standing]] to challenge the amendment's ratification under the limitations of the [[Case or Controversy Clause]] of [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]].&lt;ref name=decision/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wroth1921"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wroth|first=Lawrence Counselman|title=The Johns Hopkins Alumni Magazine: Published in the Interest of the University and the Alumni|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jx8wAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA20|accessdate=13 December 2012|year=1921|publisher=The Johns Hopkins Alumni Association.|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the Court also decided a companion case, ''[[Leser v. Garnett]]'' which upheld the Amendment's ratification process on the [[Merit (law)|merits]].

The ''Fairchild'' decision marked a departure from prior doctrine, which had allowed any citizen to sue to preserve a public right.&lt;ref&gt;The Metaphor of Standing and the Problem of Self-Governance, by Steven L. Winter, 40 ''Stan. L. Rev.'' 1371, July, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
This case is often seen as one of two cases, along with ''[[Frothingham v. Mellon]]'', that became the genesis of the [[legal doctrine|doctrine]] of legal standing. However, the term standing was not associated with Article III until the [[New Deal]] era.&lt;ref name="Stearns2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stearns|first=Maxwell L.|title=Constitutional Process: A Social Choice Analysis of Supreme Court Decision Making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1szNSQ6AvoC&amp;pg=PA385|accessdate=13 December 2012|date=2002-05-01|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472088683|pages=385–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HLR34"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Feb 1934|title=Who May Test the Constitutionality of a Statute in the Supreme Court|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=47|issue=4|page=678|jstor=1331986|doi=10.2307/1331986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genderism''', or '''gender binarism''', is the social system or cultural [[belief]] that [[gender binary|gender is a binary]]: that is, that there are, or should be, only two [[gender]]s—[[masculinity|masculine]] and [[femininity|feminine]]—with the aspects of one's gender inherently linked to one's genetic [[sex]], or sex [[sex assignment|assigned at birth]].

These aspects may include expectations of dressing, behavior, [[sexual orientation]], names or pronouns, preferred restroom, or other qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyond the Binary: Gender Identity Activism in Your School|url=https://www.gsanetwork.org/files/getinvolved/BeyondtheBinary-CampaignGuide.pdf|website=GSA Network|publisher=GSA Network|accessdate=October 24, 2015|date=Summer 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expectations may reinforce negative [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[bias]], and [[discrimination]] towards people who display [[gender expression|expression]]s of [[gender variance|gender variance or nonconformity]] or whose [[gender identity]] is incongruent with their birth sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGeeney|first1=Ester|last2=Harvey|first2=Laura|title=The Palgrave Handbook of the Psychology of Sexuality and Gender|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Handbooks|pages=149–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of occupations are classified under the broad term of ''[[graphic designer]]''. Graphic design career paths cover all ends of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]]. Many of these job descriptions overlap heavily.

==Graphic Art Managers==
The following are positions or responsibilities and usually titles, held by experienced graphic designers in related management roles:{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Creative Director===
A [[creative director|Creative Director's]] range of experience can be broad and encompass a number of disciplines; visual design; copywriting, art direction, advertising account director, film/video director. A Creative Directors job is to initiate the creative concept of a project and drive the direction of the project. The role of a Creative Director is to formulate creative concepts, whether it is an advertising campaign, brand identity, TV commercial, marketing campaign. A Creative Director was often referred to the 'Ideas Guy' and works with a team of 'creatives' - art director, graphic designer, copywriter, film director to produce the concept and final production.

===Art Director===
[[Art director]]s make sure that illustrators and production artists produce and complete their work on time and to the creative director or client's satisfaction. Art directors also play a major role in the development of a project by making decisions on the visual elements of the project, and by giving the final say on the selection of models, art, props, colors, and other elements. Art directors need advanced training in graphic design as they often do artwork and designing themselves. However, an art director's time may be consumed doing supervisory and administrative work.(See link for more information)

===Art Production Manager===
Art production managers or [[Advertising agency#Other departments and personnel|traffic manager]]s oversee the production aspect of art to improve efficiency and cost effectiveness. Art production managers supervise artists or advise the supervisors of artists. Creative directors and art directors often assume the role of art production managers, especially when production cost is not a critical enough concern to designate a manager for the specific role.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Hands-on Graphic Designer==
The following are positions or responsibilities, not necessarily titles, held by art directors and graphic designers:{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Brand identity Developer===
[[Brand identity]] design is concerned with the visual aspects of a company or organization's brand or identity. A brand identity design is the visual element that represents how a company wants to be seen; it is the company's visual identity, and is how a company illustrates its ‘image.’ A company's brand identity can be represented in terms of design through a unique [[logo]], or [[signage]], and is then often integrated throughout all the elements of a company's materials such as business cards, stationery, packaging, media advertising, promotions, and more. Brand identity may include logo design. Brand identity development is usually a collaborative effort between creative directors, art directors, copywriters, account managers and the client.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Broadcast Designers====
A [[broadcast designer]] is a person involved with creating graphic designs and electronic media incorporated in television productions that are used by [[character generator]] (CG) operators. A broadcast designer may have a degree in [[digital media]] (or a similar degree), or is self-taught in the software needed to create such content.

====Logo Designer====
The job of a [[logo design]]er is to provide a new and innovative way to express the key points of a company through an image. Logo designers take the information given to them by the client and work, using their own creativity along with marketing strategy to find an appropriate image that their client can use to represent what they are trying to encourage, sell, or what they are. It is not likely that a company will specialize in logo design or have a position for a designated logo designer. Art directors and graphic designers usually perform logo designs.

=== Illustrator ===
[[Illustrator]]s conceptualize and create [[illustrations]] that represent an idea or a story through two-dimensional or three-dimensional images. Illustrators may do drawings for printed materials such as books, magazines, and other publications, or for commercial products such as textiles, packaging, wrapping paper, greeting cards, calendars, stationery, and more.

Illustrators use many different media, from pencil and paint to digital formatting, to prepare and create their illustrations. An illustrator consults with clients in order to determine what illustrations will best meet the story they are trying to tell, or what message they are trying to communicate.

Illustrating may be a secondary skill requirement of graphic design or a specialty skill of a freelance artist, usually known for a unique style of illustrating. Illustration may be published separately as in [[fine art]]. However, illustrations are usually inserted into [[page layout]]s for [[communication design]] in the context of graphic design professions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Visual Image Developer====
Similar to illustration are other methods of [[image development (visual arts)|developing images]] such as [[photography]], [[3D modeling]], and [[image editing]]. Creative professionals in these positions are not usually called illustrators, but are utilized the same way. Photographers are likely to freelance. 3D modelers are likely to be employed for long-term projects. Image editing is usually a secondary skill to either of the above, but may also be a specialty to aid web development, software development, or multimedia development in a job title known as multimedia specialist. Although these skills may require technical knowledge, graphic design skills may be applied as well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Multimedia Developer====
Multimedia developers may come from a graphic design or illustration background and apply those talents to motion, sound, or interactivity. [[Motion graphic design|Motion designers]] are graphic designers for motion. [[Animator]]s are illustrators for motion. [[Videographer]]s are photographers for motion. Multimedia developers may also image edit, [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound edit]], program, or compose [[multimedia]] just as multimedia specialists.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Content Developer====
[[Content (media)|Content]] developer is a generic term used for describing illustrators, visual image developers, and multimedia developers in software and web development. The term has a broader scope that includes non-graphical content as well. A generic name for content that is used in a digital composition are [[digital asset]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Visual Journalist====
[[Visual Journalist]]s, also known as Infographic Artists create [[information graphics]] or Infographics; visual representations of information, data or knowledge. These graphics are used anywhere where information needs to be explained quickly or simply, such as in signs, maps, journalism, technical writing, and education. They are also used extensively as tools by computer scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians to ease the process of developing and communicating conceptual information. They are applied in all aspects of scientific visualization.

===Layout artist===
A [[page layout|layout artist]] deals with the structure and layout of images and text in a pleasing format. This can include magazine work, [[brochure]]s, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s, [[book]]s, [[CD]] booklets, [[poster]]s, and similar formats. For magazines and similar productions, [[color]], [[typeface]], text formatting, graphic layout and more must be considered. Is the chosen typeface good for long term reading, or will the eyes get tired? Does that title typeface fit the feel of the rest of the article? Are the photos arranged in such a way that is pleasing to the eye, and directs the reader in the right flow or direction? These are just some of the questions that layout artists must ask themselves. Page layouts are usually done by art directors, graphic designers, production artists or a combination of those positions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

[[Entry level job|Entry level]] layout work is often known as [[paste up]] art. Entry level layout graphic designers are often known as [[production artist]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} In an [[Advertising agencies#In-house advertising agencies|in-house art department]], layout artists are sometimes known as [[DTP artist]]s or DTP associates.

====Interface Designer====
[[Interface design]]ers are [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) layout artists. They are employed by multimedia, software, and web development companies. Because [[Graphical control element (software)|graphical control elements]] are interactive, interface design often overlaps [[interaction design]]. Because interfaces are not usually composed as single [[computer file]]s, interface design may require technical understanding, including graphical integration with code. Because interfaces may require hundreds of assets, knowledge of how to automate graphic production may be required. An interface designer may hold the [[job title]] of web designer in a [[web development]] company.

====Web Designer====
A [[web design]]er's work could be viewed by thousands of people every day. Web designers create the pages, layout, and graphics for web pages, and play a key role in the development of a website. Web designers have the task of creating the look and feel of a website by choosing the style, and by designing attractive graphics, images, and other visual elements, and adapting them for the website's pages. Web designers also design and develop the navigation tools of a site. Web designers  may make decisions regarding what content is included on a web page, where things are placed, and how the aesthetic and continuity is maintained from one screen to the next. All of this involves skill and training in computer graphics, graphic design, and in the latest in computer and web technology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Depending on the scope of the project, web design may involve collaboration between [[software engineering|software engineers]] and graphic designers. The graphic design of a website may be as simple as a page layout [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]] or handling just the graphics in an [[HTML editor]], while the advance coding is done separately by [[programmers]]. In other cases, graphic designers may be challenged to become both graphic designer and programmer in the process of web design in positions often known as [[web master]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==== Package Designer ====
A [[package design]]er or packaging technician may utilize technical skills aside from graphic design. Knowledge of cuts, crease, folding, nature and behavior of the packaging material such as paper, corrugated sheet, synthetic or other type of materials may also be required. A customer may see the top/outside of a package at first, but may also be drawn to other package design features. A packaging design may require [[Three-dimensional space]] layout skills in addition to visual communication to consider how well a design works at multiple angles. [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] software applications specifically for packaging design may be utilized

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4672">'''Hybrid navigation''' is the simultaneous use of more than one [[navigation system]] for location data determination, needed for [[navigation]]. By using multiple systems at once, the accuracy as a whole is improved. Especially for [[autonomous car|self-driving cars]], the exact and continuous knowledge of the navigating object's location is essential.&lt;ref name=HNN1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golem.de/news/autonomes-fahren-wer-hat-die-besten-karten-1509-115506.html|title=AUTONOMES FAHREN: Wer hat die besten Karten?|editor=golem | author= Friedhelm Greis | date=2015-09-02 | language=de| accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- need ref to support that GPS is the main/best/most-general one and others are only added to augment it --&gt;
[[GPS]] or other satellite based systems ([[GLONASS]], [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|GALILEO]], [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BEIDOU]], [[Quasi-Zenith Satellite System|QZSS]]) provide a way to learn one's location, but these methods require [[free field]] conditions in order to receive the radio signal. Various satellite systems are subject to switching-off or reduction of data precision by the company or government that runs them.&lt;ref name=AAHN1 /&gt; They are also prone to intentional or unintentional disturbances. Even passing through a tunnel or a garage interrupts the data flow. In situations where the signal cannot be received reliably, alternate sources of location data are needed. Combining GPS with other methods can avoid these limitations, but each method has its own specific limitations. A hybrid system provides [[fault tolerance]] for each underlying method and improves the overall precision of the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sanborn.com/highly-automated-driving-maps-for-autonomous-vehicles/| title=HIGHLY AUTOMATED DRIVING (HAD) MAPS FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES| accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hybrid system needs to decide how to choose among the different methods at any given time. One solution is a triple configuration, allowing 'result voting' for data collecting systems.&lt;ref  name="AAHN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/2145 | title=Aviation Applications: Hybrid Navigation Techniques and Safety-of-Life Requirements |author=Bestmann, vonWulfen, Hecker, Kneissl, Kropp | date=August 2010 | accessdate= 2016-07-17 | language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICON1&gt;{{cite book|title=Multiple criteria decision making : proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference |editor1= Günter Fandel|editor2=Tomas Gal, Thomas Hanne |author=Johannes Jahn|chapter=Optimality Conditions in Set Valued Vector Optimation |pages=22 |location=New York |publisher= Springer-Verlag |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Alternate systems that supply navigational data include:
* [[Inertial navigation system]]s. This system determines location by summing the movement vectors from start of the trip or some other [[waypoint]] whose location is well-defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydro-international.com/content/article/how-does-inertial-navigation-work |title=How Does Inertial Navigation Work? |editor= Hydro International|date= 2011-01-27 |author=Leendert Dorst | language=en|accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8799">[[File:Puerta Ciudadela.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Uruguayan people]], a [[melting pot]] in the [[Southern Cone]].]]
'''Immigration to Uruguay''' started with the arrival of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] settlers during the [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Colonial Period]] to what was then known as ''[[Banda Oriental]]''. The immigration to Uruguay is very similar, if not the same, towards the [[Immigration to Argentina]]. Throughout history, Uruguay is known to gain massive waves of immigration all around the world, specifically European immigration, where today 90-95% of the Uruguayan population contains a European background. The climax of these immigration movements occurred during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], where the whole [[Europe|European]] continent was in a very unsettling position. The most highlighted group of immigrants in Uruguay are the [[Spaniards]] and [[Italians]], both establishing the backbone of modern day Uruguayan culture and society.

==Overview==
[[Uruguay]] is a multiethnic nation formed by the combination of different groups over five centuries. [[Amerindians]] inhabited Uruguayan territory for several millennia before Spanish Conquest in the 16th century. [[Spaniards]] and [[Africans]] arrived in significant numbers under colonial rule. Many people of European background, African background and some Amerindians.&lt;ref name="multicult"&gt;{{cite web |author=Felipe Arocena |title=The contribution of immigrants to Uruguay |url=http://multiculturalismoenuruguay.com/Docs/Articulos/ArocenaCEIC.doc.pdf |accessdate=21 October 2013 |publisher=Multiculturalismoenuruguay.com}} {{es icon}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, there has been a gradual European immigration from several countries, which had its peak between 1870 and 1920; back then, [[Villa del Cerro]] neighbourhood in Montevideo was characteristically populated by immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Manuel Esmoris |url=http://www.gestioncultural.com.uy/vinculos/ESMORIS_VillaDELcerro.pdf |title=Villa del Cerro, identity and fracture |accessdate=24 October 2013 |publisher=Gestioncultural.com.uy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029220038/http://www.gestioncultural.com.uy/vinculos/ESMORIS_VillaDELcerro.pdf |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1831, government troops massacred most of the Amerindian population under the command of General [[Fructuoso Rivera]], this is remembered as the Matanza del Salsipuedes.

==Main immigration groups==
[[File:European Ancestry Large.svg|thumb|250px|A map showing European immigration around the world, with the majority of Uruguay (and parts of Argentina and southern Brazil, respectively) having more than 90% of European ancestry]]
[[Spanish Uruguayan|Spaniards]], [[Italian Uruguayan|Italians]], and [[Afro-Uruguayan|descendants of African slaves]] together formed the backbone of modern day Uruguayan culture and society. 

Minor immigrant groups that, although are small in number, still play an important role in Uruguayan society, include:

* [[French Uruguayans|French]]: Making 10% of Uruguay's population (c. 300,000), Frenchmen began immigrating to South America during the 1800s. French Uruguayans are the third largest ancestry group in Uruguay, behind Spaniards and Italians. Ever since French immigrants entered Uruguay, French influence has always been strong in Uruguayan culture.

* [[German Uruguayans|Germans]]: Uruguay does contain a number of Germans: about 10,000 German expatriates and 40,000 people of German descent. Uruguay has also adopted some of Germany's culture, and a variety of German institutions.

* [[Jews]]: Uruguay has about 12,000-20,000 Jews, and even though it isn't a large number, it's one of the biggest Jewish communities in the world, and one of the biggest religions in Uruguay. The majority of Jews entered during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], the most being [[Ashkenazi Jews]], [[German Jews]], and [[Italian Jews]].

* [[Lebanese Uruguayans|Lebanese]]: There are about 53,000-70,000 Lebanese in Uruguay; it is one of the oldest immigrant groups in South America, dating the first wave back around the 1860s.

* Other significant minorities include: Armenians, Austrians, Basque, Britons, Bulgarians, Croats, Greeks, [[Romani people|Gypsies]], Hungarians, Irish, Scots, Lithuanians, Poles, Russians, Slovaks, Slovenes, Swiss, Ukrainians. There are very small Asian communities, mainly from [[Chinese people in Uruguay|China]], [[Japanese Uruguayan|Japan]] and [[Koreans in Uruguay|Korea]].&lt;ref name="multicult"/&gt;

There is a very recent inflow of Latin Americans: [[Peruvians in Uruguay|Peruvians]], [[Bolivians in Uruguay|Bolivians]], [[Paraguayans in Uruguay|Paraguayans]], [[Venezuelans in Uruguay|Venezuelans]]. The [[University of the Republic (Uruguay)|University of the Republic]] is free, which means that several [[Chileans in Uruguay|Chilean]] students come to study in Uruguay. Many people from neighboring [[Argentines in Uruguay|Argentina]] and [[Brazilians in Uruguay|Brazil]], who frequently travel to Uruguay to spend their holidays, have chosen it as permanent residence. In a very recent trend, North Americans and Europeans also choose Uruguay to retire. There are over 12,000 foreign workers from 81 countries registered in the Uruguayan social security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/economia/noticias/extranjeros-uruguay-actividad-laboral-crecimiento.html |title=Foreign workers in Uruguay |accessdate=4 November 2013 |publisher=[[El País (Uruguay)|EL PAIS]] }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigrants tend to integrate in mainstream society, as several scholars have shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org.uy/shs/fileadmin/templates/shs/archivos/anuario2004/articulo04_03.pdf |title=La asimilación cultural de los siriolibaneses y sus descendientes en Uruguay |accessdate=2 February 2015 |author=[[Renzo Pi Hugarte]] }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]] in the [[Philippines]], the occupying Japanese government-issued [[fiat currency]] in several denominations; this is known as the '''Japanese government-issued Philippine fiat peso''' (see also [[Japanese invasion money]]). The [[Second Philippine Republic]] under President [[José P. Laurel]] outlawed possession of [[Emergency circulating notes|guerrilla currency]], and declared a [[monopoly]] on the issuance of money, so that anyone found to possess guerrilla notes could be arrested or even executed.

Some Filipinos called the fiat peso "[[Mickey Mouse]] money". Many survivors of the war {{Who|date=July 2011}} tell stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or "''bayóng''" (native bags made of woven coconut or ''[[Corypha|buri]]'' leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills. According to one witness, 75 "Mickey Mouse" pesos, or about 35 U.S. dollars at that time, could buy one duck egg.&lt;ref name="LATimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=A Return to Wartime Philippines |author=Barbara A.

Garcia Publishing Company, [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These bills were often used by American [[psychological warfare]] personnel as propaganda leaflets. Japanese occupation banknotes were overprinted with the words "The Co-prosperity Sphere: What is it worth?", in an attempt to discredit the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], and dropped from Allied aircraft over the occupied territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Friedman | first =Herbert A. | title =WWII Allied Propaganda Banknotes | url=http://www.psywarrior.com/WWIIAlliedBanknotes.html | accessdate = 2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oppositional political terrorism===
His earliest research is in the field of oppositional political terrorism (OPT). Ross has specialized in the causal dynamics of OPT. Using quantitative research, Ross developed Attributes of Terrorism in Canada (ATIC), the first data base on OPT in Canada, which was later acquired by the Solicitor General of Canada. This research led Ross to be an expert witness for the Canadian Senate's Special Committee on Terrorism and Public Safety (1986). This source of data, was used in a series of quantitative research studies Ross conducted during the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Behind Bars, Beyond Bars, and Convict Criminology|url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/theprisonshow/2012/03/24/behind-bars-beyond-bars-and-convict-criminology|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=The Prison Show|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policing===
In the field of policing, Ross has examined the challenges facing police departments operating in both western and non-western communities; how incidents of police violence/excessive force come to public attention, and whether this sets an agenda for the police organization to change; and the myths of community policing. Ross has written two books in this area: ''Making News of Police Violence'' (Praeger, 2000), and ''Policing Issues: Challenges and Controversies'' (Jones and Bartlett, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Beyond Bars' Amid Bad Times|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106550398|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=NPR Books|date=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Books by Jeffrey Ian Ross|url=https://www.amazon.com/Jeffrey-Ian-Ross/e/B000AQ10W6/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corrections===
Ross’ research in the area of [[corrections]] has focused on understanding problems in this branch of the criminal justice system. Ross is also interested in high security prisons, and edited ''The Globalization of Supermax Prisons'' (Rutgers University Press, 2013). Ross is the co-author of ''Behind Bars: Surviving Prison'' (Alpha Books, 2002) and ''Beyond Bars: Rejoining Society After Prison'' (Alpha Books, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutraloaf: Cruel and Unusual Punishment?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfirwzi_Muc|work=The Alyona Show|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Books by Jeffrey Ian Ross|url=https://www.amazon.com/Jeffrey-Ian-Ross/e/B000AQ10W6/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross is co-founder of the Convict Criminology movement in the field of criminology/criminal justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convict Criminology|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237080265_Convict_Criminology|website=Research Gate|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political crime/state crime===
Ross wrote ''The Dynamics of Political Crime'' (Sage, 2002), and the follow up book ''Introduction to Political Crime'' (Policy Press, 2012).  In the field of state crime, the bulk of Ross’ research has focused on the problem of controlling state crime. This has led to two edited books:  ''Controlling State Crime: An Introduction'', (Transaction Publishers, 2000) and ''Varieties of State Crime and Its Control'' (Criminal Justice Press, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=WMAR |last=Staff|title=Amber Alert has evolved into vital tool in finding abducted children|url=http://www.abc2news.com/news/region/baltimore-county/amber-alert-has-evolved-into-vital-tool-in-finding-abducted-children|accessdate=20 May 2014|newspaper=abc2news.com|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Books by Jeffrey Ian Ross|url=https://www.amazon.com/Jeffrey-Ian-Ross/e/B000AQ10W6/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crime and justice in American Indian communities===
Ross has also published in the area of crime and justice in American Indian communities.  This includes (with Larry Gould) ''Native Americans and the Criminal Justice System'' (Paradigm Publishers, 2006), and ''American Indians at Risk'' (ABC-Clio, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Books by Jeffrey Ian Ross|url=https://www.amazon.com/Jeffrey-Ian-Ross/e/B000AQ10W6/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kingdom of Nepal''' ({{lang-ne|नेपाल अधिराज्य}}), also known as the '''Kingdom of Gorkha''' ({{lang-ne|गोरखा अधिराज्य}}), was a [[Hindu]] kingdom on the [[Indian subcontinent]], formed in 1768,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Nepal/nepal5.htm Royal Ark]&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[unification of Nepal]]. Founded by [[Prithvi Narayan Shah|King Prithvi Narayan Shah]], a [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkhali]] monarch of [[Rajput]] origin,&lt;ref name="Schmidt2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl J. Schmidt|title=An Atlas and Survey of South Asian History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BqdzCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138|date=20 May 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47681-8|pages=138–}}&lt;/ref&gt; it existed for 240 years until the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy in 2008. During this period, [[Nepal]] was formally under the rule of the [[Shah dynasty]], which exercised varying degrees of power during the kingdom's existence.

After the invasion of [[Tibet]] and plundering of Digarcha by Nepali forces under Prince Regent [[Bahadur Shah of Nepal|Bahadur Shah]] in 1792, the Dalai Lama and Chinese Ambans reported to Chinese administration for military support. The Chinese and Tibetan forces under Fu Kang An attacked Nepal but went for negotiation after failure at Nuwakot.&lt;ref name="nepalarmythree"&gt;{{Cite web|URL=http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/history.php?page=three|title=Nepal and Tibetan conflict|publisher=Official website of Nepal Army}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early-nineteenth century, however, the expansion of the [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] (1814–1816), which resulted in Nepal's defeat. Under the [[Sugauli Treaty]], the kingdom retained its independence, but in exchange for territorial concessions making [[Mechi River]] to [[Mahakali River]] its boundary under Nepalese rule,&lt;ref name="nepalarmytwo"/&gt; sometimes known as "[[Greater Nepal]]". Forces sent by [[Jung Bahadur Rana]] defeated the Tibetan forces on 1855 to force the Tibetan side to sign treaty favouring Nepal.&lt;ref name="nepalarmythree"/&gt; Political instability following the war resulted in the ascendancy of the [[Rana dynasty]] of [[Khas]] [[Chhetri]] [[Rajput]] origin, which made the office of [[List of Prime Ministers of Nepal|Prime Ministers of Nepal]] hereditary in their family for the next century, from 1843 to 1951. Beginning with [[Jung Bahadur]], the first Rana ruler, the Rana dynasty reduced the Shah monarch to a figurehead role. Rana rule was marked by tyranny, debauchery, economic exploitation and religious persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietrich|first=Angela|title=Buddhist Monks and Rana Rulers: A History of Persecution|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm |accessdate=17 September 2013|newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Lal |first=C. K.|title= The Rana resonance |url= http://nepalitimes.com/news.php?id=8741 |accessdate=17 September 2013|newspaper= Nepali Times |date=16 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1950, the newly independent republic of [[India]] signed a [[1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship|friendship treaty]] in which both nations agreed to respect the other's sovereignty. In November of the same year, India played an important role in supporting [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuhvan]], whom the Rana leader [[Mohan Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana]] had attempted to depose and replace with his infant grandson [[Gyanendra of Nepal|King Gyanendra]]. With Indian support for a new government consisting largely of the [[Nepali Congress]], King Tribhuvan ended the rule of the Rana dynasty in 1951.

Unsuccessful attempts were made to implement reforms and a constitution during the 1960s and 1970s. An economic crisis at the end of the 1980s led to a popular movement which brought about parliamentary elections and the adoption of a constitutional monarchy in 1990. The 1990s saw the beginning of the [[Nepalese Civil War]] (1996–2006), a conflict between government forces and the insurgent forces of the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]]. The situation for the Nepalese monarchy was further destabilised by the 2001 [[Nepalese royal massacre]], in which [[Dipendra of Nepal|Crown Prince Dipendra]] reportedly shot and killed ten people, including his father [[Birendra of Nepal|King Birendra]], and was himself mortally wounded by what was allegedly a self-inflicted gunshot.

As a result of the massacre, King Gyanendra returned to the throne. His imposition of direct rule in 2005 provoked a [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|protest movement]] unifying the [[Maoism|Maoist]] insurgency and pro-democracy activists. He was eventually forced to restore Nepal's [[House of Representatives (Nepal)|House of Representatives]], which in 2007 adopted an [[Constitution of Nepal|interim constitution]] greatly restricting the powers of the Nepalese monarchy. Following an [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly election, 2008|election held the next year]], the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly]] formally abolished the kingdom in its first session on 28 May 2008, declaring the [[Nepal|Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal]] in its place.

Until the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal was the world's only country to have [[Hinduism]] as its [[state religion]]; the country is now formally a [[secular state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theindiapost.com/2009/10/28/why-monarchy-is-necessary-in-nepal/ Why Monarchy is necessary in Nepal?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/news/?NewsID=1471 |date= 18 January 2008 |author=George Conger |work=Religious Intelligence |title=Nepal moves to become a secular republic |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130031409/http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/news/?NewsID=1471 |archivedate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
===Origins===
[[File:Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Nepal (1962-2008).jpg|thumb|Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Nepal (1962-2008)]]
The country was expanded from the one of the [[Chaubisi rajya|Chaubise principality]] called the [[Gorkha Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Whelpton|first=John|title=A History of Nepal|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-521-80470-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Bahun|Parbate Brahmins]] and the ruling [[Shah dynasty]] as well as the [[Chhetri]] aristocratic clans such as "[[Pande dynasty]]", "[[Basnyat dynasty]]", "[[Thapa dynasty]]" and "[[Kunwar family]]"&lt;ref name="kathmandupost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2012-01-31/bulbudder-and-the-british.html|title=Bulbudder and the British|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (later "[[Rana dynasty]]") among the Gorkhali people trace their ancestry to the [[Hindu]] [[Rajput]]s and [[Brahmin]]s of Northern India who entered modern Nepal from the West following Muslim advances. The actual historical process however by which this migration took place and the history of the Gorkhalis' ultimate conquest of Nepal span a couple of centuries and are drastically different from what Chauhan proposes. More importantly, Chauhan's overall thesis claiming the existence of a Gurkha identity way before the Shahs came to the Nepali hills is not supported by historical evidence available in Nepal. In Nepal the warrior people are not referred to as 'Gurkhas', they are called 'Gorkhalis', meaning the 'inhabitants of Gorkha.' Their famed battle cry is 'Ayo Gorkhali', meaning 'the Gorkhali has come.'{{cn|date=November 2018}} 

The etymology of the geographical name 'Gorkha' is indeed related to the Hindu mendicant-saint [[Gorakshanath|Gorakhnath]]. In the village of Gorkha is situated a temple dedicated to Gorakhnath as well as another dedicated to Gorakhkali, a corresponding female deity. The Nepali geographical encyclopedia 'Mechi-dekhi Mahakali' ('From Mechi to Mahakali') published in 2013 Bikram Era (1974-75 AD) by the authoritarian Panchayat government to mark the coronation of King Birendra Shah agrees with the association of the name of the place with the saint but does not add any further detail.&lt;ref name="Mechi-dekhi Mahakali p. 70"&gt;'Mechi-dekhi Mahakali, Vol. 3, Paschimanchal Bikas Kshetra' p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The facts regarding when the temples were built and the place named after the saint are lost in the sweeping winds of time. We may guess that these developments took place in the early part of the second millennium of the Common Era following the rise of the Nath sect. In fact, the pilgrimage circuit of the sect across the northern Indian sub-continent also spans a major part of present-day Nepal including Kathmandu Valley. The [[Newars]] of Medieval Nepal have a couple of important temples and festivals dedicated to the major Nath teachers. Immediately before the rule of Gorkha by the Shahs, Gorkha was inhabited by both Aryan and Mongoloid ethnic groups and ruled by the [[Khadka]]s, who were probably of [[Khas people|Khas]] origin. Dravya Shah defeated the Khadkas in 1559 AD and commenced Shah rule over the principality.&lt;ref name="Mechi-dekhi Mahakali p. 70"/&gt; Prithvi Narayan Shah belonged to the ninth generation of the Shahs in Gorkha. He took the reins of power in 1742 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Devi Prasad, 'Adhunik Nepal-ko Itihas (1742-1961 AD).' [[Ratna Pustak Bhandar]]. Kathmandu. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Nuwakot===
[[File:Bamshidhar Kalu Pande.jpg|thumb|''[[Kaji (Nepal)|Kaji]]'' [[Kalu Pande|Vamshidhar "Kalu" Pande]]; commander of Gorkhali forces at victorious battle of Nuwakot]]
The first battle by Gorkhali forces united under King Prithvi Narayan was Battle of Nuwakot. The first army commander was Kaji [[Kalu Pande]] of the [[Pande dynasty]] of Gorkha. Pande put up tactics to attack Nuwakot, a strategic fort of Malla King of Kathmandu, by multiple sides with surprise. On 26th September 1744, Pande with a contingent of soldiers climbed from the northern side of Nuwakot city at Mahamandal. He led the surprise attack with a Gorkhali war cry of '''''Jai [[Kali]], Jai [[Gorakhnath]], Jai [[Manakamana]]'''''.{{sfn|Hamal|1995|p=98}} The panicked soldiers under commander of Nuwakot Shankha Mani tried to defend but lost after their commander was killed by a 13 year old prince [[Dal Mardan Shah]], brother of King Prithvi Narayan.&lt;ref name="nepalarmy"&gt;https://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/page/history&lt;/ref&gt; The second contingent of Gorkhali forces led by ''Chautariya'' Mahoddam Kirti Shah (a brother of King Prithvi Narayan) passed Dharampani and faced strong tussle but ultimately won over the defenders.&lt;ref name="nepalarmy"/&gt; The third part of the forces was led by the King Prithvi Narayan himself advanced to the fort of Nuwakotgadhi after the capture of Mahamandal. The soldiers panicked by death of their commander fled to Belkot from the Nuwakot fort and Nuwakot was annexed by Gorkha.&lt;ref name="nepalarmy"/&gt;
===Battle of Kirtipur===
{{Main|Battle of Kirtipur}}
[[File:Gorkha3.jpg|thumb|Gorkhali soldiers preparing war against Kathmandu Valley]]
Despite his initial resentment of Kaji [[Kalu Pande]] that the valley kings were well prepared and the Gorkhalis were not, Pande agreed for battle against the Kingdom of [[Kirtipur]] in the [[Kathmandu valley]] on being insisted from the monarch [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]]. The Gorkhalis had set up a base on Naikap to mount their assaults on Kirtipur. They were armed with swords, bows and arrows and [[musket]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vansittart, Eden (1896). ''Notes on Nepal''. Asian Educational Services. {{ISBN|978-81-206-0774-3}}. Page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
The two forces fought on the plain of Tyangla Phant in the northwest of [[Kirtipur]]. Surapratap Shah, the King's brother lost his right eye to an arrow while scaling the city wall. The Gorkhali commander Kaji [[Kalu Pande]] was surrounded and killed, and the Gorkhali king himself narrowly escaped with his life into the surrounding hills disguised as a [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Majupuria |first=Trilok Chandra |title=Kirtipur: The Ancient Town on the Hill |url=http://www.nepal-traveller.com/index.php?action=articledetail&amp;id=259 |accessdate=18 October 2012 |newspaper=Nepal Traveller |date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Daniel |authorlink= |coauthors= |url=https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfNepal/HistoryOfNepaldanielWright#page/n269/mode/2up |title=History of Nepal |work= |publisher=New Delhi: Asian Educational Services |year=1990 |accessdate=7 November 2012}} Page 227.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1767, the King of Gorkha Prithvi Narayan sent his army to attack Kirtipur a third time under the command of Surpratap. In response, the three kings of valley joined forces and sent their troops to the relief of Kirtipur, but they could not dislodge the Gorkhalis from their positions.

King Digbardhan Sen and his minister Kanak Singh Baniya had already sent their families to safer grounds before the encirclement of their fortress. The Gorkhalis launched an attack on 21st August 1762. The battle lasted for eight hours. King Digbardhan and his minister Kanak Singh escaped to Hariharpur Gadhi. Makawanpur was thus annexed to Nepal.&lt;ref name="nepalarmy"/&gt;

After occupying the Makawanpur Gadhi fort, the Gorkhali forces started planning for an attack on Hariharpur Gadhi, a strategic fort on a mountain ridge of the Mahabharat range, also south of Kathmandu. It controlled the route to the Kathmandu valley. At the dusk of 4th October, 1762, the Gorkhalis launched the attack. The soldiers at Hariharpur Gadhi fought valiantly against the Gorkha forces, but were ultimately forced to vacate the Gadhi after mid-night. About 500 soldiers of Hariharpur died in the battle.&lt;ref name="nepalarmy"/&gt; Mir Qasim, the [[Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad|Nawab of Bengal]] extended his help to kings of Kathmandu valley with his forces to attack the Gorkhali forces.

[[File:Battle of Jhunga.jpg|thumb|Battle of Jhunga in 1788 A.D., Nepali forces (in black) achieved victory against Tibetan forces (in red &amp; yellow)]]
After the death of Prithvi Narayan Shah, the Shah dynasty began to expand their kingdom into what is present day North India. Between 1788 and 1791, Nepal invaded Tibet and robbed [[Tashi Lhunpo Monastery]] of [[Shigatse]]. Tibet sought Chinese help and the [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the Chinese [[Qing Dynasty]] appointed [[Fuk'anggan]] commander-in-chief of the Tibetan campaign. Heavy damages were inflicted on both sides. The Nepali forces retreated step by step back to Nuwakot to stretch Sino-Tibetan forces uncomfortably. Chinese launched uphill attack during the daylight and failed to succeed due to strong counterattack with [[Khukuri]] at Nuwakot.&lt;ref name="nepalarmythree"/&gt; The Chinese army suffered a major setback when they tried to cross a monsoon-flooded Betrawati, close to the Gorkhali palace in Nuwakot.&lt;ref&gt;Stiller, L.F., "The Rise of the House of Gorkha."

===Anglo-Gurkha War===
{{Main|Anglo-Nepalese War}}
Rivalry between Nepal and the [[East India Company]]—over the princely states bordering Nepal and India—eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] (1814–16), in which Nepal was defeated. The [[Treaty of Sugauli]] was signed in 1816, ceding large parts of the Nepali territories of Terrai and [[Sikkim]], (nearly one third of the country), to the British, in exchange for Nepalese [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]]. As the territories were not restored to Nepal by the British when freedom was granted to the people of [[British India]], these have become a part of the [[Republic of India]], although the people of Sikkim decided in a public referendum in 1975 to merge the kingdom in India and become a state in the Republic of India. After losing the land, the [[East India Company]] decided to give some of territories back to Nepal.

===Rana dynasty rule===
{{Main|Rana dynasty}}
[[File:RaniOfNepal1920.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|Rani (Queen) of Nepal surrounded by her Ladies-in-Waiting, 1920]]
Factionalism among the [[royal family]] led to a period of instability after the war. In 1846, Queen Rajendralakshmi plotted to overthrow [[Jang Bahadur]], a fast-rising military leader of Indian [[Rajput]] ancestry who was presenting a threat to her power. The plot was uncovered and the queen had several hundred princes and chieftains executed after an armed clash between [[military]] personnel and administrators loyal to the queen. This came to be known as the [[Kot Massacre]]. However, Bahadur emerged victorious eventually and founded the [[Rana dynasty]]; the monarch was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary, held by a Ranas.

===Third Nepalese Tibet War ===
{{main|Nepalese-Tibetan War}}
[[File:Battle of Guntagadhi.jpg|thumb|Battle of Guntagadhi where Nepali forces (dressed in black) achieved victory over Tibet on 1855 AD]]
[[Jung Bahadur Rana]] sent forces under his brothers Bam Bahadur Kunwar Rana and Dhir Shamsher Rana to attack Tibet again to achieve complete victory. His forces succeeded on defeating Tibetan forces on two sides. The Tibetan team arrived on January 1856 to sign treaty. After a month, Treaty of Thapathali was signed which was more favourable to Nepal.&lt;ref name="nepalarmythree"/&gt;

==20th century==

=== Nepal and the British ===
The Rana regime, a tightly centralized [[autocracy]], pursued a policy of isolating Nepal from external influences. This policy helped Nepal maintain its national independence during the British colonial era, but it also impeded the country's economic development and modernisation. The Ranas were staunchly pro-British and assisted the British during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and later in both [[World War]]s.  At the same time, although Chinese claims, the British supported Nepalese independence at the beginning of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

===Democratic reform===
{{Main|Democracy movement in Nepal}}

Popular dissatisfaction against the family rule of the Ranas had started emerging from among the few educated people, who had studied in various Indian schools and colleges, and also from within the Ranas, many of whom were marginalised within the ruling Rana hierarchy. Many of these Nepalese in exile had actively taken part in the Indian Independence struggle and wanted to liberate Nepal as well from the internal autocratic Rana occupation. The political parties such as ''The Prajaparishad'' and ''[[Nepali Congress]]'' were already formed in exile by leaders such as [[B.P. Koirala]], Ganesh Man Singh,  Subarna Sumsher Rana, [[Krishna Prasad Bhattarai]], [[Girija Prasad Koirala]] and many other patriotic-minded Nepalis who urged the military and popular political movement in Nepal to overthrow the autocratic Rana Regime. Among the prominent martyrs to die for the cause, executed at the hands of the Ranas, were ''Dharma Bhakta Mathema, Shukraraj Shastri, Gangalal Shrestha and Dasharath Chand''. This turmoil culminated in [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuvan]], a direct descendant of Prithvi Narayan Shah, fleeing from his "palace prison" in 1950, to newly independent [[India]], touching off an armed revolt against the Rana administration. This eventually ended in the return of the Shah family to power and the appointment of a non-Rana as prime minister. A period of quasi-constitutional rule followed, during which the monarch, assisted by the leaders of fledgling political parties, governed the country. During the 1950s, efforts were made to frame a constitution for Nepal that would establish a representative form of government, based on a British model.

In early 1959, Tribhuvan's son [[Mahendra of Nepal|King Mahendra]] issued a new constitution, and the first democratic elections for a national assembly were held. The [[Nepali Congress Party]], a moderate socialist group, gained a substantial victory in the election. Its leader, [[Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala]], formed a government and served as prime minister. After years of power wrangling between the kings (Tribhuvan and Mahendra) and the government, Mahendra dissolved the democratic experiment in 1960.

===King Mahendra's new constitution===
{{main|Panchayat (Nepal)}}
Declaring the contemporary parliament a failure, King Mahendra in 1960 dismissed the Koirala government, declared that a "partyless" [[panchayat]] system would govern Nepal, and promulgated another new constitution on 16 December 1962.

Subsequently, the Prime Minister, Members of Parliament and hundreds of democratic activists were arrested. In fact, this trend of arrest of political activists and democratic supporters continued for the entire 30-year period of partyless Panchayati System under King Mahendra and then his son, King Birendra.

The new constitution established a "partyless" system of panchayats (councils) which King Mahendra considered to be a democratic form of government, closer to Nepalese traditions. As a pyramidal structure, progressing from village assemblies to a [[Rastriya Panchayat]] (National Parliament), the panchayat system constitutionalised the absolute power of the monarchy and kept the King as head of state with sole authority over all governmental institutions, including the Cabinet (Council of Ministers) and the Parliament. One-state-one-language became the national policy, and all other languages suffered at the cost of the official language, "Nepali", which was the king's language.

King Mahendra was succeeded by his 27-year-old son, King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]], in 1972. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in 1979, King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide on the nature of Nepal's government: either the continuation of the panchayat system with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum was held in May 1980, and the panchayat system won a narrow victory. The king carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat.

==End of Panchayat system==
There was resentment against the authoritarian regime and the curbs on the freedom of the political parties. There was widespread feeling of the Palace being non-representative of the masses, especially when the Marich Man Singh government faced political scandals on charges of misappropriation of funds allotted for the victims of the earthquake in August 1991 or when it reshuffled the Cabinet instead of investigating the deaths of the people in a stampede in the national sports complex in a hailstorm. Also the souring of the India-Nepal trade relations affected the popularity of the Singh government.

In April 1987, Nepal had introduced the work permit for Indian workers in three of its districts, and in early 1989, Nepal provided 40% duty concession to Chinese goods and later withdrew duty concessions from Indian goods in such a manner that the Chinese goods became cheaper than the Indian goods. This led to the souring of relations which were already strained over the purchase of Chinese arms by Nepal in 1988. India refused to renew two separate Treaties of Trade and Transit and insisted on a single treaty dealing with the two issues, which was not acceptable to Nepal. A deadlock ensued and the Treaties of Trade and Transit expired on 23 March 1989. The brunt of the closure of the trade and transit points was mainly faced by the lower classes in Nepal due to the restricted supply of consumer goods and petroleum products such as petrol, aviation fuel and kerosene. The industries suffered because of their dependence on India for resources, trade and transit. The Government of Nepal tried to deal with the situation by depending on foreign aid from the US, UK, Australia and China. However, the government's strategy to manage the crisis could not satisfy those people who desired negotiations with India rather than dependence on foreign aid as a solution.

Taking advantage of the uneasiness amongst some people against the government and the strained India-Nepal relations, the Nepali Congress (NC) and the left-wing parties blamed the government for perpetuating the crisis and not taking any serious measures to solve it. In December 1989, the NC tried to utilize B.P. Koirala's anniversary by launching a people's awareness program. The left-wing alliance known as the United Left Front (ULF) extended its support to the NC in its campaign for a party system. On 18–19 January 1990, the NC held a conference in which leaders from various countries and members of the foreign Press were invited. Leaders from India attended the conference; Germany, Japan, Spain, Finland supported the movement; and the Embassies of the US and West Germany were present on the occasion. Inspired by the international support and the democratic movements occurring throughout the world after the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1989, the NC and the ULF launched a mass movement on 18 February to end the Panchayat regime, and the installation of an interim government represented by various parties and people.

On 6 April the Marich Man Singh government was dismissed and Lokendra Bahadur Chand became the Prime Minister on the same day. However, the agitating mob was not satisfied with the change of government as they were not against the Singh government per se but against the party-less system. On 16 April the Chand government was also dismissed and a Royal Proclamation was issued the next day which dissolved the National Panchayat, the Panchayat policy and the evaluation committee and the class organizations. Instead, the proclamation declared "functioning of the political parties" and maintained that ''"all political parties will always keep the national interest uppermost in organizing themselves according to their political ideology."''

During this protest many civilians were killed: after the end of the Panchayat rule they were seen as 'undeclared martyrs'. One of those martyrs is [[Ram Chandra Hamal]], member of the Nepali Congress and killed during his imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/nepal/60.htm|title=Nepal - The Panchayat System|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990 People's Movement==
{{Main|1990 People's Movement}}
People in rural areas had expected that their interests would be better represented after the adoption of parliamentary democracy in 1990. The [[Nepali Congress]] with support of "Alliance of leftist parties" decided to launch a decisive agitational movement, [[Jana Andolan]], which forced the monarchy to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament. In May 1991, Nepal held its first parliamentary elections in nearly 50 years. The Nepali Congress won 110 of the 205 seats and formed the first elected government in 32 years.

===Civil strife===
In 1992, in a situation of economic crisis and chaos, with spiralling prices as a result of implementation of changes in policy of the new [[Nepali Congress|Congress]] government, the radical left stepped up their political agitation. A Joint People's Agitation Committee was set up by the various groups.&lt;ref&gt;The organisers of the Committee were the [[Samyukta Janamorcha Nepal]], the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre)]], [[Communist Party of Nepal (Masal)]], the [[Nepal Communist League]] and the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist)]].&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hartal|general strike]] was called for 6 April.

Violent incidents began to occur on the evening before of the strike. The Joint People's Agitation Committee had called for a 30-minute 'lights out' in the capital, and violence erupted outside [[Bir Hospital]] when activists tried to enforce the 'lights out'. At dawn on 6 April, clashes between strike activists and police, outside a police station in Pulchok ([[Patan, Lalitpur|Patan]]), left two activists dead.

Later in the day, a mass rally of the Agitation Committee at Tundikhel in the capital [[Kathmandu]] was attacked by police forces.

When promised land reforms failed to appear, people in some districts started to organize to enact their own land reform and to gain some power over their lives in the face of usurious landlords. However, this movement was repressed by the Nepali government, in [[Operation Romeo]] and [[Operation Kilo Sera II]], which took the lives of many of the leading activists of the struggle. As a result, many witnesses to this repression became radicalised.

===Nepalese Civil War===
{{Main|Nepalese Civil War}}
In February 1996, one of the [[Maoist]] parties started a bid to replace the [[parliamentary]] monarchy with a people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the [[people's war]], which led to the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. Led by Dr. [[Baburam Bhattarai]] and [[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]] (better known as "Prachanda"), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: [[Rolpa]], [[Rukum]], [[Jajarkot District|Jajarkot]], [[Gorkha District|Gorkha]], and [[Sindhuli]]. The Maoists declared the existence of a provisional "people's government" at the district level in several locations.

===Palace massacre===
{{Main|Nepalese royal massacre}}
[[File:Narayanhiti Palace Museum.jpg|thumb|400px|The Narayanhiti Palace where the royal massacre occurred.]]
On 1 June 2001, Crown Prince [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] allegedly went on a [[Nepalese royal massacre|shooting-spree]], assassinating 9 members of the royal family, including King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and Queen [[Aishwarya of Nepal|Aishwarya]], before shooting himself. Due to his survival he temporarily became king before dying of his wounds, after which Prince [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra]] (Birendra's brother) inherited the throne, according to tradition. The massacre shattered the aura of mythology that still surrounded the Royal Family, exposing their far too human intrigues.

Meanwhile, the Maoist rebellion escalated, and in October 2002 the king temporarily deposed the government and took complete control of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor = Mahendra Lawoti and Anup K. Pahari |title =  The Maoist Insurgency in Nepal | year = 2012 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 9780415777179}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later he reappointed another government, but the country was still very unstable because of the civil war with the Maoists, the various clamouring political factions, the king's attempts to take more control of the government, and worries about the competence of Gyanendra's son and heir, Prince [[Paras of Nepal|Paras]].

===Suspension of responsible government===
In the face of unstable governments and a Maoist siege on the Kathmandu Valley in August 2004, popular support for the monarchy began to wane. On 1 February 2005, Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and took to exercising his executive powers without ministerial advice, declaring a "[[state of emergency]]" to quash the Maoist movement. Politicians were placed under [[house arrest]], phone and internet lines were cut, and freedom of the press was severely curtailed.

===2006 democracy movement in Nepal===
{{Main|2006 democracy movement in Nepal}}

The king's new regime made little progress in his stated aim of suppressing the insurgents. The European Union described the municipal elections of February 2006 as "a backward step for democracy", as the major parties [[election boycott|boycotted the election]] and the army forced some candidates to run for office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1699935,00.html The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006 [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|strikes and street protests in Kathmandu]] forced the king to reinstate the parliament. A seven-party coalition resumed control of the government and stripped the king of most of his powers. As of 15 January 2007 a [[unicameral]] legislature under an interim constitution governed Nepal.

===Abolition of the monarchy===
The [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly]] came to fruition on 24 December 2007 when it was announced that the monarchy would be abolished in 2008 after the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly election, 2008|Constituent Assembly election]]s;&lt;ref name=abolish&gt;{{cite news| title =Nepalese monarchy to be abolished| publisher =BBC| date =24 December 2007| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7158670.stm| accessdate =25 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 28 May 2008, Nepal was declared a ''Federal Democratic Republic''.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Nepal|Geology of Nepal}}
[[Image:Nepal topo en.jpg|thumb|Topographic map of Nepal]]
[[Image:KaliGandaki.jpg|thumb|The arid and barren Himalayan landscape]]

The Kingdom of Nepal was of roughly trapezoidal shape, 800&amp;nbsp;kilometres (500&amp;nbsp;[[Mile|mi]]) long and 200&amp;nbsp;kilometres (125&amp;nbsp;mi) wide, with an area of 147,181&amp;nbsp;[[square kilometre]]s (56,827&amp;nbsp;[[Square mile|sq&amp;nbsp;mi]]). Nepal was commonly divided into three physiographic areas: the Mountain, [[Hill Region|Hill]], and [[Terai Region]]s. These ecological belts run east-west and are bisected by Nepal's major river systems. Nepal is roughly the same size as the US [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Arkansas]] or the country of [[England]].

The Madhesi Plains bordering India are part of the northern rim of the [[Indo-Gangetic plains]]. They were formed and are fed by three major rivers: the [[Kosi River|Kosi]], the [[Gandaki River|Narayani]] (India's Gandak River), and the [[Karnali River|Karnali]]. This region has a hot, humid climate.

The Hill Region (''Pahad'') abuts the mountains and varies from 1,000 to 4,000 metres (3,300&amp;ndash;13,125&amp;nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]) in altitude. Two low mountain ranges, the [[Mahabharat Lekh]] and [[Siwalik Hills|Shiwalik Range]] (also called the Churia Range) dominate the region. The hilly belt includes the Kathmandu Valley, the country's most fertile and urbanised area. Unlike the valleys Called Inner Tarai (Bhitri Tarai Uptyaka) elevations above 2,500 metres (8,200&amp;nbsp;ft) are sparsely populated.

The Mountain Region contains the highest region in the world. The world's highest mountain, [[Mount Everest]] (''Sagarmatha'' in Nepali) at 8,850 metres (29,035&amp;nbsp;ft) is located on the border with [[China]]. Eight more of the world's [[Eight-thousander|ten highest mountains]] are located in Nepal: [[Lhotse]], [[Makalu]], [[Cho Oyu]], [[Kanchenjunga]], [[Dhaulagiri]], [[Annapurna]] and [[Manaslu]]. Deforestation is a major problem in all regions, with resulting erosion and degradation of ecosystems.

Nepal has five climatic zones, broadly corresponding to altitude. The [[tropical]] and subtropical zones lie below 1,200 metres (3,940&amp;nbsp;ft), the [[temperate]] zone 1,200 to 2,400 metres (3,900&amp;ndash;7,875&amp;nbsp;ft), the cold zone 2,400 to 3,600 metres (7,875&amp;ndash;11,800&amp;nbsp;ft), the subarctic zone 3,600 to 4,400 metres (11,800&amp;ndash;14,400&amp;nbsp;ft), and the Arctic zone above 4,400 metres (14,400&amp;nbsp;ft). Nepal experiences five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]], autumn, winter and spring. The Himalaya blocks cold winds from [[Central Asia]] in winter, and forms the northern limit of the monsoon wind patterns.

Although Nepal shares no boundary with [[Bangladesh]], the two countries are separated by a narrow strip of land about 21 kilometre (13&amp;nbsp;mi) wide, called the [[Siliguri Corridor|Chicken's Neck]]. Efforts are underway to make this area a free-trade zone.

Situated in the Great Himalayan Range in Northern part of Nepal, [[Mount Everest]] has the highest [[altitude]] of any mountain in the world. Technically, the south-east ridge on the Nepali side of the mountain is easier to climb, so most climbers travel to Everest through Nepal. The [[Annapurna]] mountain range also lies in Nepal.

==Zones, districts, and regions==
{{Main|Zones of Nepal|Districts of Nepal|Regions of Nepal}}
[[Image:Nepal zones.png|thumb|Nepalese Zones]]

Nepal was divided into 14 [[Zones of Nepal|zones]] and 75 [[Districts of Nepal|districts]], grouped into 5 [[Regions of Nepal|development regions]]. Each district was headed by a fixed chief district officer responsible for maintaining law and order and coordinating the work of field agencies of the various government ministries. The 14 zones are:

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Nepal}}
[[Image:Nepal landscape 1.jpg|thumb|Terraced farming on the foothills of the Himalayas]]

Agriculture sustains 76% of the population and accounts for about 39% of the [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]; services comprise 41%, and industry 22%. Nepal remains isolated from the world's major land, air and sea transport routes though air traffic is frequent. Hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. There were just over 8,500&amp;nbsp;km of paved roads, and one 59&amp;nbsp;km railway line in the south in 2003. There is only one reliable road route from India to the Kathmandu Valley. The only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for Kathmandu is Kolkata in India. Internally, the poor state of development of the road system (22 of 75 administrative districts lack road links) makes volume distribution unrealistic.

Aviation is in a better state, with 48 airports, ten of them with paved runways. There is less than one telephone per 19 people; landline telephone services are not adequate nationwide but concentrated in cities and district headquarters; mobile telephony is in a reasonable state in most parts of the country with increased accessibility and affordability. There were around 175,000 Internet connections in 2005, but after the imposition of the "state of emergency", intermittent losses of service were reported. Uninterrupted Internet connections have resumed after the brief period of confusion as Nepal's second major people's revolution took place to overthrow the King's absolute power.&lt;ref name="CIA_World_Factbook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nepal |work=[[CIA World Factbook]] |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/np.html |accessdate=23 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country receives foreign aid from [[India]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], the [[European Union]], [[PRC|China]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Scandinavia]]n countries. The government's budget is about US$1.153 billion, with expenditures of $1.789bn (FY05/06). The [[inflation]] rate has dropped to 2.9% after a period of higher inflation during the 1990s. The [[Nepali Rupee]] has been tied to the [[Indian Rupee]] at an exchange rate of 1.6 for many years. Since the loosening of exchange rate controls in the early 1990s, the black market for foreign exchange has all but disappeared. A long-standing economic agreement underpins a close relationship with India.

The [[distribution of wealth]] among the Nepali is consistent with that in many developed and developing countries: the highest 10% of households control 39.1% of the national wealth and the lowest 10% control only 2.6%.

Nepal's workforce of about 10 million suffers from a severe shortage of skilled labour. Agriculture employs 81% of the workforce, services 16% and manufacturing/craft-based industry 3%. Agricultural produce—mostly grown in the Terai region bordering India—includes rice, corn, wheat, sugarcane, root crops, milk, and water buffalo meat. Industry mainly involves the processing of agricultural produce, including [[jute]], sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. The spectacular landscape and deep, exotic culture of Nepal represents considerable potential for tourism, but growth in this export industry has been stifled by recent political events. The [[unemployment rate|rate of unemployment and underemployment]] approaches half of the working-age population. Thus many Nepali citizens move to India in search of work, the Gulf countries and Malaysia being new sources of work. Poverty is acute.&lt;ref name="Sexual_Exploitation_Factbook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nepal |work=Factbook on Global Sexual Exploitation |url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/nepal.htm |accessdate=23 September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230080519/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/nepal.htm |archivedate=30 December 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepal receives US$50 million a year through the [[Gurkha]] soldiers who serve in the [[Indian Army|Indian]] and [[British Army|British]] armies and are highly esteemed for their skill and bravery. The total remittance value is worth around 1 billion USD, including money sent from Persian Gulf and Malaysia, who combined employ around 700,000 Nepali citizens.

Nepal's GDP for the year 2005 is estimated at just over US$39 billion (adjusted to [[Purchasing Power Parity]]), making it the 83rd-largest economy in the world. Per-capita income is less than US$300. Nepal's exports of mainly carpets, clothing, leather goods, [[jute]] goods and grain total $822 million. Import commodities of mainly gold, machinery and equipment, petroleum products and fertilizer total US$2 bn. India (53.7%), the US (17.4%), and [[Germany]] (7.1%) are its main export partners. Nepal's import partners include India (47.5%), the [[United Arab Emirates]] (11.2%), China (10.7%), [[Saudi Arabia]] (4.9%), and [[Singapore]] (4%).&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Nepal}}

Until 1990, Nepal was an [[absolute monarchy]] running under the executive control of the king. Faced with a people's movement against the absolute monarchy, King Birendra, in 1990, agreed to large-scale political reforms by creating a [[parliamentary monarchy]] with the king as the [[head of state]] and a prime minister as the [[head of the government]].

Nepal's legislature was [[bicameral]] consisting of a [[Nepal House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and a [[National Council of Nepal|National Council]]. The House of Representatives consists of 205 members directly elected by the people. The National Council had sixty members, ten nominated by the king, thirty-five elected by the House of Representatives and the remaining fifteen elected by an electoral college made up of chairs of villages and towns. The legislature had a five-year term, but was dissolvable by the king before its term could end. All Nepali citizens 18 years and older became eligible to vote.

The executive comprised the King and the [[Council of Ministers]] (the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]). The leader of the coalition or party securing the maximum seats in an election was appointed as the Prime Minister. The Cabinet was appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Governments in Nepal have tended to be highly unstable; no government has survived for more than two years since 1991, either through internal collapse or parliamentary dissolution by the monarch on the recommendation of prime minister according to the constitution.

The movement in April 2006 brought about a change in the nation. The autocratic King was forced to give up power. The dissolved House of Representatives was restored. The House of Representatives formed a government which had successful peace talks with the Maoist Rebels. An interim constitution was promulgated and an interim House of Representatives was formed with Maoist members. The number of seats were also increased to 330. The peace process in Nepal made a giant leap in April 2007, when the [[List of communist parties in Nepal|Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] joined the interim government of Nepal. The peace process seems to be in jeopardy after Maoists decided to leave coalition government on 18 September 2007, demanding the declaration of a republic before the scheduled constituent assembly.

Nepal's military consists of the [[Nepalese Army]] which includes the [[Nepalese Army Air Service]] (the [[air force]] unit under it). The [[Nepalese Police Force]] is the civilian police and the [[Armed Police Force Nepal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apf.gov.np/introduction/introduction.php Official Website of Armed Police Force Nepal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710190154/http://www.apf.gov.np/introduction/introduction.php |date=10 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the paramilitary force. Service is voluntary and the minimum age for enlistment is 18 years. Nepal spends $99.2 million (2004) on its military—1.5% of its GDP. Most of the equipment and arms are supplied by [[India]].{{ref|arms}}

Nepal has close ties with both of its neighbours, India and China. In accordance with a long-standing treaty, Indian and Nepalese citizens may travel to each other's countries without a [[passport]] or [[visa (document)|visa]]. Nepalese citizens may work in India without legal restriction. Although Nepal and India typically have close ties, from time to time Nepal becomes caught up in the problematic Sino-Indian relationship. India considers Nepal as part of its realm of influence, and views Chinese aid with concern. Some Indians consider Nepal to be part of a greater pan-Indian state, an attitude that has caused Nepalese antagonism towards India. In 2005, after King Gyanendra took over, Nepalese relations with India, the US, and the UK worsened. These three foreign countries were vociferous opponents to the crackdown on civil liberties in Nepal.

==Demographics==
[[Image:Shiva temple in Pashupatinath.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Shaivaite]] [[Pashupatinath temple]] ]]
{{Main|Demographics of Nepal}}
Nepal has a total population of 27,676,547 as of July 2005, with a growth rate of 2.2%. 39% of the population is up to 14 years old, 57.3% are aged between 15 and 64, and 3.7% above 65. The median age is 20.07 (19.91 for males and 20.24 for females). There are 1,060 males for every 1,000 females. Life expectancy is 59.8 years (60.9 for males and 59.5 for females). Total [[Literacy|literacy rate]] is 53.74% (68.51% for males and 42.49% for females).

Groups are the [[Brahman-Hill]] 12.5%, [[Magar people|Magar]] 7%, [[Tharu people|Tharu]] 6.6%, [[Tamang]] 5.5%, [[Newar]] 5.4%, [[Kami (caste)|Kami]] 3.9%, [[Yadav]] 3.9%, other 32.7%, Nepali White 2.8%. [[Nepali language|Nepali]] is the national language with 47.8% of the population speaking it as their first language. Other languages include [[Maithili language|Maithili]] 12.1%, [[Bhojpuri]] 7.4%, [[Tharu languages|Tharu]] (Dagaura/Rana) 5.8%, [[Tamang]] 5.1%, [[Nepal Bhasa]] 3.6%, [[Magar language|Magar]] 3.3%, [[Awadhi]] 2.4%, other 10%, unspecified 2.5%. Differences between Hindus and Buddhists have been in general very subtle and academic in nature due to the intermingling of Hindu and Buddhist beliefs. Both share common temples and worship common deities and many of Nepal's Hindus could also be regarded as Buddhists and [[vice versa]].&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, Religion and Society&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gurkhas]] are from Nepal. Buddhism was relatively more common among the Newar. Among the other natives of Nepal, those most influenced by Hinduism were the [[Magar people|Magar]], [[Sunwar]], [[Limbu people|Limbu]] and [[Rai people|Rai]]. Hindu influence is less prominent among the [[Gurung]], [[Bhutia]], and [[Thakali people|Thakali]] groups, who employ Buddhist monks for their religious ceremonies.&lt;ref name="CIA_World_Factbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Library_of_Congress"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Country Study: Nepal|work=Federal Research Division, [[Library of Congress]]|url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/nptoc.html| accessdate =23 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern mountains are sparsely populated. A majority of the population live in the central highland despite the migration of a significant section of the population to the fertile Terai belt in recent years. Kathmandu, with a population of around 800,000 (Metropolitan area: 1,5 million) is the largest city in the country.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Nepal}}
[[File:Gaze of a priest.JPG|thumb|Hilly priest wearing a cultural [[Dhaka topi]] and [[Tilak]] at Kathmandu]]
Nepalese culture is diverse and it reflects people of different ethnic origins. A typical Nepalese meal is ''dal-bhat'', a kind of a lentil soup served with rice and vegetables. However, the Newar community has its own unique cuisine. It consists of non-vegetarian and vegetarian items as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Mustard oil and a host of spices, such as cumin, sesame seeds, turmeric, garlic, ginger, methi (fenugreek), bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, pepper, chili, mustard seeds, vinegar, etc. are used in cooking. The cuisine served in the festivals is considered as the best diet cuisine.

Folklore is an integral part of Nepalese society. Traditional stories are rooted in the reality of day-to-day life—tales of love, affection, battles, and demons and ghosts; they reflect and explain local lifestyles, cultures and belief systems. Many Nepalese folktales are enacted in dance and music. The Newar community is very rich in cultural diversity. Most of the festivals observed in the Kthmandu valley are in the Newar community. The Newars are also well known for their music and dance. The Newar Music consists mainly of percussion instruments. Wind instruments such as flutes and similar instruments are also used. String instruments are very rare. There are songs pertaining to particular seasons and festivals. Paahan chare music is most probably the fastest played music whereas the Dapa the slowest. The dhimay music are the loudest ones. There are certain musical instruments such as Dhimay and Bhusya which are played as instrumental only and are not accompanied with songs. The Newar Dance can be broadly classified as masked dance and dance without the use of masks. The most representative of Newari dance is Lakhey dance. Almost all the settlements of Newar have Lakhey dance at least once a year. Almost all of these Lakhey dances are held in the Goonlaa month. So, they are called Goonlaa Lakhey. However, the most famous Lakhey dance is the Majipa Lakhey dance. It is performed by the Ranjitkars of Kathmandu. The dance takes place for a week during the week containing the full moon of Yenlaa month. The Lakhey are considered as the saviors of children. Likewise, in hills people enjoy their own kind of music, playing saarangi (string instrument), madal and flute. They also have many popular folk songs like ''lok geet'' and ''lok dohari''.

The Nepali year begins in mid-April and is divided into 12 months. Saturday is the official weekly holiday. Main holidays include the National Day (birthday of the king) 28 December, Prithvi Jayanti, (11 January), and Martyr's Day (18 February) and a mix of Hindu and Buddhist festivals such as [[dashai]] in autumn, and ''[[tihar (festival)|tihar]]'' late autumn. During tihar, the Newar community celebrates its New Year as per local calendar (Nepal Sambat).

Most houses in rural Nepal are made up of a tight bamboo framework with mud and cow-dung walls. These dwellings remain cool in summers and retain warmth in winters. Dwellings in higher latitudes are mostly timber based.

==Current condition==
After Sri Lanka’s independence from [[UK|Britain]] in 1948, [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Sri Lankan Tamil politics]] was geared towards a nationalistic cause. ''Koviar'' using their ritual and physical proximity to the educational services upgraded themselves socially and economically. The [[Policy of standardization]] imposed by the successive Sri Lankan governments since 1973 had the effect of restricting the number of Tamil students entering state [[Universities]] and affected upwardly mobile ''Koviar'' students as much as the dominant class. Hence ''Koviar'' were also involved in many of the Tamil nationalistic agitations that eventually resulted in the formation of [[Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups|many Tamil militant groups]]. They were prominent in one of them namely [[TELO]] that was eventually eclipsed by the [[LTTE]] that was also seen as to be associated with [[Karaiyar]] caste in [[Jaffna]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The [[Sri Lankan Civil War|civil war]] and the [[Black July]] pogroms have retarded most of these gains and many have escaped the deprivations by seeking [[refugee]] status in [[India]], [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. They are merging with the host populations and/or the [[Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora]].&lt;ref name=DR&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=grMjo9Opu14C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22Koviar%22&amp;sig=Vdzi6TzNXIgYYPX5zTcEWzC-_XM#PPA104,M1

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13096">'''Lad culture''' (also '''laddish culture''' and '''laddism''') is a British [[subculture]] initially associated with the [[Britpop]] movement. Arising in the early 1990s, the image of the "lad" – or "new lad" – was that of a generally [[middle class]] figure espousing attitudes typically attributed to the [[working class]]es. The subculture involves young men assuming an [[Anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]] position, shunning sensitivity in favour of [[Drinking culture|drinking]], [[violence]], and [[sexism]].&lt;ref name=r1&gt;Dr Joanne Knowles in Kristina Nelson's ''Narcissism in High Fidelity'' (2004) p. 19 {{ISBN|0595318045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term "new lad" was coined by journalist [[Sean O'Hagan (journalist)|Sean O'Hagan]] in a 1993 article in ''[[Arena (magazine)|Arena]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/jan/23/features.review7 |title=New kid on the newsstand |author=Tim Adams |date=23 January 2005  |work=The Observer |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/a_boys_own_story |title=A Boy’s Own Story |author=Michael Bracewell |date=June–August 1996 |work=[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]] |publisher=Frieze |accessdate=20 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024210700/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/a_boys_own_story/ |archivedate=24 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gill | first = Rosalind | authorlink = Rosalind Gill | contribution = Power and the production of subjects: a genealogy of the New Man and the New Lad | editor-last = Benwell | editor-first = Bethan | editor-link = Bethan Benwell | title = Masculinity and men's lifestyle magazines | pages = 34–56 | publisher = Blackwell Publisher/Sociological Review | location = Oxford, UK Malden, MA, USA | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781405114639 }} [http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/genderInstitute/pdf/powerAndProduction.pdf pdf version Gender Institute,] [[London School of Economics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of "the [[postmodern]] transformation of masculinity&amp;nbsp;... the 1990s 'new lad' was a clear reaction to the '[[male feminism|new man]]'&amp;nbsp;... most clearly embodied in current men's magazines, such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'' and ''[[Loaded (magazine)|Loaded]]'', and marked by a return to [[hegemonic]] masculine values of [[sexism]] [and] male [[homosociality]]".&lt;ref&gt;Nylund, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when "men saw themselves as battered by [[feminism]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Faludi, Susan |title=Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MXLdwDPkpWgC|year=2000|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-380-72045-3|page=594}}&lt;/ref&gt; one could also consider that "laddishness is a response to humiliation and indignity&amp;nbsp;... the ''girl-power''! ''girl-power''! female triumphalism which echoes through the land".&lt;ref&gt;Weldon, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Lad culture grew beyond men's magazines to movies such as ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'' and ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' and to the [[Television|TV]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultures of Masculinity|author=Tim Edwards|pages=39–42|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-28480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bsuicide"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/475253.stm|date=1999-10-17|title=Health: Lad culture blamed for suicides|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bottom (TV series)|Bottom]]'', ''[[Al Murray's Happy Hour]]'' and ''[[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]]'' are television programmes that present images of laddishness that are dominated by the male pastimes of [[drinking culture|drinking]], watching [[football (soccer)|football]], and [[Sexual intercourse|sex]]. These are presented as being [[irony|ironic]] and "knowing" (the [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]] of ''Loaded'' is "for men who should know better").

==Postfeminism==
The rise of the new lad coincided with a backlash against feminism by both men and women, and in particular against the figure of the [[Male feminism|new man]] as "one who has subjugated his masculinity in order to fulfill the needs of women&amp;nbsp;... this passive and insipid image".&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, Joanne ''Nick Hornby's High Fidelity'' (2002) pp. 16, 39 {{ISBN|0826453252}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when "the stereotypes for men attentive to feminism were two: Eunuch, or Beast",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolf, Naomi |title=Promiscuities: The Secret Struggle For Womanhood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYQae9GaIU8C|year=1998|publisher=Random House of Canada|isbn=978-0-679-30942-0|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and when women were increasingly feeling that "[[Male feminist|new men]] are fine in the kitchen, but who wants them in the bedroom?"&lt;ref&gt;Weldon, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; – the "new lad" image offered "a space of fun, consumption and sexual freedom for men", as well as "a refuge from the constraints and demands of marriage and nuclear family".&lt;ref&gt;Genz, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting the two gender constructs, Tim Edwards, a sociologist at the [[University of Leicester]], describes the [[Male feminist|new man]] as ''pro''-[[feminism|feminist]], albeit [[narcissism|narcissistic]], and the new lad as ''pre''-feminist, and a reaction to [[second-wave feminism]].&lt;ref name=Edwards /&gt;&lt;ref name=AITS&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives|author1=Pamela Abbott |author2=Claire Wallace |author3=Melissa Tyler |year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-31258-2|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new man image failed to appeal to a wide readership whereas the more adolescent Lad culture appeals more to the ordinary man, says Edwards.&lt;ref name=Edwards /&gt; Social constraints also meant that "it is easier to be a lad rather than a new man in most workplaces".&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Holland, ''Alternative Femininities'' (2004) p. 29 {{ISBN|1859738087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Edwards also points out that lad culture men's magazines of the 21st century contain little that is actually new.  Noting a study of the history of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', he observes that there is little substantially different between the new man ''Arena'' and ''GQ'' and the new lad ''Loaded'' et al. Both address assumed men's interests of cars, alcohol, sport, and women, and differ largely in that the latter have a more visual style.  From this he infers that "the [[Male feminism|New Man]] and the New Lad are niches in the market more than anything else, often defined according to an array of lifestyle accessories", and concludes that the new lad image dominates the new man image simply because of its greater success at garnering advertising revenue for men's magazines.

==Criticism==
Lad culture has attracted criticism from feminist circles. For example, [[Germaine Greer]] critiques it in her 2000 book ''The Whole Woman'';&lt;ref name=Edwards /&gt;&lt;ref name=AITS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson, C.|year=2006|title=Lads and Ladettes in School: Gender and a Fear of Failure|location=Maidenhead|publisher=Open University Press|isbn=0335225918}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Kira Cochrane]] asserts that "it's a dark world that ''Loaded'' and the lad culture has bequeathed us".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2007/08/lad-culture-cochrane-loaded Kira Cochrane, "The dark world of lads' mags"]. Newstatesman.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Joanne Knowles of [[Liverpool John Moores University]] wrote that the "lad" displays "a pre-feminist and racist attitude to women as both [[sex object]]s and creatures from another species".&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

A study by Gabrielle Ivinson of [[Cardiff University]] and Patricia Murphy of the [[Open University]] identified lad culture as a source of behavioural confusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.bps.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/releases$/iccpl-2001$/lad-culture-and-boys-confusion-about-behaviour$.cfm|date=2001-06-28|title=Lad Culture and Boys' Confusion about Behaviour|publisher=The British Psychological Society|location=Leicester, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an investigation by Adrienne Katz linked it to [[suicide]] and [[clinical depression|depression]].&lt;ref name="Bsuicide"/&gt; A study of the architecture profession found that lad culture had a negative impact on women completing their professional education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gates, Charlie|date=2003-07-11|title=Lad culture forces women to quit: RIBA-funded study looks at reasons behind profession's high female drop-out rate|work=Building Design|volume=1587|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentator Helen Wilkinson believes that lad culture has affected politics and decreased the ability of women to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wilkinson, Helen|date=1998-08-07|title=The day I fell out of love with Blair|work=[[New Statesman]]|volume=127|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|The UK's largest student union]] warned in a 2015 study that universities were failing to address the issue of lad culture, with almost half (49%) of all universities having no policy against discrimination due to sexuality, or anti-sexual harassment policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Joe Williams|title=British universities failing to tackle homophobic "lad culture"|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/07/27/british-universities-failing-to-tackle-homophobic-lad-culture/|accessdate=27 July 2015|work=[[PinkNews]]|date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ladette==
The word "'''ladette'''" has been coined to describe young women who take part in laddish behaviour. It is defined by the ''[[Concise Oxford Dictionary]]'' as: "Young women who behave in a boisterously assertive or crude manner and engage in heavy drinking sessions."&lt;ref name=COD&gt;
{{cite news |title=Ladettes enter dictionary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1434906.stm |work= |publisher=BBC News |date=12 July 2001|accessdate=}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Locations==
The term "lad" is also used in [[Australia]]n [[youth culture]], however it is used to refer to an [[underclass]] [[criminal]] subculture that is more similar to the [[chav]] or [[football casual]] subcultures, rather than the middle class student subculture  the term refers to in the United Kingdom. Australian lads wear a distinctive dress code, consisting of running caps and shoes combined with striped polo shirts and sports shorts. They frequently use [[pig latin]] phrases in conversation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life/tribes-of-the-sydney-20100106-lv15.html|title=Tribes of the Sydney|author=Sacha Molitorisz|date=7 January 2010|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example "Ad-lay" to refer to a fellow "Lad". Lad-rap is a growing underground [[hip hop]] scene in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_au/blog/is-lad-rap-ready-to-save-aussie-hip-hop|title=Is Lad Rap Ready to Save Aussie Hip Hop?|author=Rei Barker|date=|work=Noisey (music by Vice)|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It exhibits similarities to Swiss [[Romansh language|Romansh]] and [[Friulian language|Friulian]].

The precise extension of the Ladin language area is the subject of scholarly debates. A more narrow perspective includes only the dialects of the valleys around the [[Sella group]], while wider definitions comprise the dialects of adjacent valleys in the Province of Belluno and even dialects spoken in the northwestern Trentino.&lt;ref&gt;Giovan Battista Pellegrini: ''Ladinisch: Interne Sprachgeschichte II. Lexik.'' In: ''[[Lexikon der Romanistischen Linguistik]]'', III. Tübingen, Niemeyer 1989, {{ISBN|3-484-50250-9}}, p. 667: ''È necessaria innanzi tutto una precisazione geografica circa l'estensione del gruppo linguistico denominato «ladino centrale», dato che le interpretazioni possono essere varie.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kramer: ''Ladinisch: Grammatikographie und Lexikographie.'' In: ''[[Lexikon der Romanistischen Linguistik]]'', III. Tübingen, Niemeyer 1989, {{ISBN|3-484-50250-9}}, p. 757: ''Im folgenden sollen die Grammatiken und Wörterbücher im Zentrum stehen, die das Dolomitenladinische im engeren Sinne ([...] Gadertalisch [...], Grödnerisch, Buchensteinisch, Fassanisch [...]) behandeln, während Arbeiten zum Cadorinischen [...] und zum Nonsbergischen [...] summarisch behandelt werden.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[standard language|standard]] written variety of Ladin (''Ladin Dolomitan'') has been developed by the Office for Ladin Language Planning as a common communication tool across the whole Ladin-speaking region,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spell-termles.ladinia.net/en.html The office for Ladin language planning]&lt;/ref&gt; but it is not popular among Ladin speakers.

Ladin should not be confused with [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] (also called Judeo-Spanish), which, although also Romance, is derived from [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]].

==Geographic distribution==

It is not possible to assess the exact number of Ladin speakers, because only in the provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino are the inhabitants asked to identify their native language in the general census of the population, which takes place every 10 years.

===Trentino===
In the 2011 census, 18,550 inhabitants of Trentino declared Ladin as their native language.&lt;ref name=trentino2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statistica.provincia.tn.it/binary/pat_statistica/demografia/15CensGenPopolazione.1340956277.pdf

|}

The [[Nones language]] in the [[Non Valley]] and the related [[Solandro language]] found in the [[Sole Valley]] are [[Gallo-Romance languages]] and often grouped together into a single linguistic unit due to their similarity. They are spoken in 38 municipalities but have no official status. Their more precise classification is uncertain. Both dialects show a strong resemblance to Trentinian dialect and [[Eastern Lombard dialect|Eastern Lombard]], and scholars debate whether they are Ladin dialects or not.

About 23% of the inhabitants from Val di Non and 1.5% from Val di Sole declared Ladin as their native language at the 2011 census. The number of Ladin speakers in those valleys amounts to 8,730, outnumbering the native speakers in the [[Fassa Valley]].&lt;ref name="Minority"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trentinocorrierealpi.gelocal.it/cronaca/2012/06/30/news/ladini-i-nonesi-superano-i-fassani-1.5342702|title=Ladini: i nonesi superano i fassani |author= |year=2012|work=Trentino Corriere Alpi |publisher= |accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to stress the difference between the dialects in Non and Fassa valleys, it has been proposed to distinguish between ''ladins dolomitiches'' (Dolomitic Ladinians) and ''ladins nonejes'' (Non Valley Ladinians) at the next census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=|title=La pruma valutazions del diretor de l'Istitut Cultural Ladin Fabio Ciocchetti|author= |year=2012|work=La Usc di Ladins, nr. 26 /06 de messel 2012, p. 25|publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Province of Belluno===
There is no linguistic census in the [[province of Belluno]], but the number of Ladin speakers has been estimated using a 2006 survey. In this area, there are about 1,166 people who speak the standard Ladin and 865 who speak the dialect of Ladin, so out of 8,495 inhabitants they are the 23.9%. They live in the part of the province that was part of the County of Tyrol until 1918, comprising the communes of [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] (15.6% Ladin), [[Colle Santa Lucia]] (50.6% Ladin) and [[Livinallongo del Col di Lana]] (54.3% Ladin).&lt;ref name=veneto2006&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iannaccaro|first=Gabriele|date=|title=SURVEY LADINS.

The provincial administration of Belluno has enacted to identify Ladin as a minority language in additional municipalities. Those are: [[Agordo]], [[Alleghe]], [[Auronzo di Cadore]], [[Borca di Cadore]], [[Calalzo di Cadore]], [[Canale d'Agordo]], [[Cencenighe Agordino]], [[Cibiana di Cadore]], [[Comelico Superiore]], [[Danta di Cadore]], [[Domegge di Cadore]], [[Falcade]], [[Forno di Zoldo]], [[Gosaldo]], [[La Valle Agordina]], [[Lozzo di Cadore]], [[Ospitale di Cadore]], [[Perarolo di Cadore]], [[Pieve di Cadore]], [[Rivamonte Agordino]], [[Rocca Pietore]], [[San Nicolò di Comelico]], [[San Pietro di Cadore]], [[San Tomaso Agordino]], [[San Vito di Cadore]], [[Santo Stefano di Cadore]], [[Selva di Cadore]], [[Taibon Agordino]], [[Vallada Agordina]], [[Valle di Cadore]], [[Vigo di Cadore]], [[Vodo di Cadore]], [[Voltago Agordino]], [[Zoldo Alto]], [[Zoppè di Cadore]]. Ladinity in the province of Belluno is more ethnic than linguistic. The varieties spoken by Ladin municipalities are Venetian alpine dialects, which are grammatically no different to those spoken in municipalities that did not declare themselves as Ladin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jemi.myblog.it/files/lingue_minoranza_scuola.pdf] Italian Ministry of Education, contributions among others by Prof. Gabriele Jannaccaro, Univ. Milano-Bicocca, ''La ladinità bellunese è piuttosto etnica che linguistica, e le varietà parlate dei comuni ladini sono dei dialetti veneti alpini grammaticalmente non diversi da quelli dei comuni che non si sono dichiarati ladini'' (Ladinity in the province of Belluno is more ethnic than linguistic, and the varieties spoken by Ladin municipalities are Venetian alpine dialects grammatically identical to those spoken in the municipalities that did not declare themselves as Ladin)&lt;/ref&gt; Their language is called ''Ladino Bellunese''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Videsott, Chiara Marcocci, [http://www.unibz.it/it/library/Documents/bupress/publications/preview/R%C3%A4toromanische-Bibliographie_1-26.pdf Bibliografia retoromanza 1729–2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816012920/http://www.unibz.it/it/library/Documents/bupress/publications/preview/R%C3%A4toromanische-Bibliographie_1-26.pdf |date=16 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Ladin dialects spoken in the province of Belluno, including those in the former Tyrolean territories, enjoy a varying degree of influence by Venetian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-salzburg.at/pls/portal/docs/1/1731384.PDF] Map showing similarity of dialects around Belluno, from "Dialectometric Analysis of the Linguistic Atlas of Dolomitic Ladin and Neighbouring Dialects (ALD-I &amp; ALD-II)" by Prof. Dr. Roland Bauer, 2012, University of Salzburg&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:PflügerWengen60.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Ladin farmers in 1960s [[La Val]], South Tyrol]]
The name derives from [[Latin]], because Ladin is originally a [[Vulgar Latin]] language left over from the [[Ancient Rome|Romanized]] Alps. Ladin is often attributed to be a relic of Vulgar Latin dialects associated with [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]]. Whether a [[proto-Romance language]] ever existed is controversially discussed amongst linguists and historians, a debate known as ''[[Questione Ladina]]''. Starting in the 6th century, the [[Bavarii]] started moving in from the north, while from the south [[Gallo-Italic languages]] started pushing in, which further shrank the original extent of the Ladin area. Only in the more remote mountain valleys did Ladin survive among the isolated populations.

Starting in the very early Middle Ages, the area was mostly ruled by the [[County of Tyrol]] or the [[Bishopric of Brixen]], both belonging to the realms of the Austrian [[Habsburg]] rulers. The area of Cadore was under the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]]. During the period of the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]] and, after 1804, the Austrian Empire, the Ladins underwent a process of [[Germanisation|Germanization]].
[[File:Josef Anton Vian.jpg|thumb|Kurat Josef Anton Vian - anonymous author of the first Ladin-Gherdëina grammar AD 1864&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.micura.it/en/encounter/ladin-culture/literature-and-indentity/the-origins-of-the-ladin-literature]|First Ladin-Gherdëina&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After the end of World War I in 1918, Italy annexed the southern part of Tyrol, including the Ladin areas. The Italian nationalist movement of the 19th and 20th centuries regarded Ladin as an "[[Regional Italian|Italian dialect]]", a notion rejected by various Ladin exponents and associations,&lt;ref&gt;"Die Ladiner betrachten sich seit jeher als eigenständige Ethnie" and "Wir sind keine Italiener, wollen von jeher nicht zu ihnen gezählt werden und wollen auch in Zukunft keine Italiener sein! (..) Tiroler sind wir und Tiroler wollen wir bleiben!" (''The ladins view themselves as a distinct ethnic group: ... we are not Italians and since ever do not want to be considered as part of them! We are Tyroleans and we want to stay Tyroleans!'') from ''Die questione ladina – Über die sprachliche und gesellschaftliche Situation der Dolomitenladiner'' by Martin Klüners, ISBN 9 783638 159159&lt;/ref&gt; despite their having been counted as Italians by the Austrian authorities as well. The programme of [[Italianization]], professed by fascists such as [[Ettore Tolomei]] and [[Benito Mussolini]], added further pressure on the Ladin communities to subordinate their identities to Italian. This included changing Ladin place names into the Italian pronunciation according to Tolomei's ''[[Prontuario dei nomi locali dell'Alto Adige]]''.

Following the end of World War II, the [[Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement]] of 1946 between Austria and Italy introduced a level of autonomy for Trentino and South Tyrol but did not include any provisions for the Ladin language. Only in the second autonomy statute for South Tyrol in 1972 was Ladin recognized as a partially official language.

==Status==
[[File:Scuola ladina.JPG|thumb|Plaque of a Ladin school in Santa Cristina.]]
Ladin is officially recognised in Trentino and South Tyrol by provincial and national law. Italy signed the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] of 1991, but it has not ratified it so far. The charter calls for [[minority rights]] to be respected and [[minority language]]s, to which Ladin belongs, to be appropriately protected and promoted. Starting in the 1990s, the Italian parliament and provincial assembly have passed laws and regulations protecting the Ladin language and culture. A cultural institute was founded to safeguard and educate in the language and culture. School curricula were adapted in order to teach in Ladin, and street signs are being changed to bilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canazei.dk/public/image/canazei_sign.jpg |title=Canazei – Skiferie i Canazei i Italien |author= |year=2011 |work= |publisher=Canazei.dk  |language=Danish |accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ladin is also recognized as a protected language in the [[Province of Belluno]] in [[Veneto]] region pursuant to the Standards for Protection of Historic Language Minorities Act No. 482 (1999). In comparison with South Tyrol and Trentino, the wishes of the Ladins have barely been addressed by the regional government. In a popular referendum in October 2007, the inhabitants of [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] overwhelmingly voted to leave Veneto and return to South Tyrol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cresce la Voglia di Trentino Alto Adige Quorum Raggiunto a Cortina d'Ampezzo|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/cronaca/referendum-cortina/referendum-cortina/referendum-cortina.html#Scene_1|accessdate=22 May 2011|newspaper=La Repubblica|date=28 October 2007|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cortina Vuole Andare in Alto Adige|url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/07_ottobre_29/cortina_referendum.shtml|accessdate=22 May 2011|newspaper=Corriere della Sera|date=29 October 2007|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redrawing of the provincial borders would return Cortina d'Ampezzo, [[Livinallongo del Col di Lana]] and [[Colle Santa Lucia]] to South Tyrol, to which they traditionally belonged when part of the [[County of Tyrol]] or the [[Bishopric of Brixen]].
[[File:Trilingual road sign in Val Gardena.jpg|thumb|Trilingual traffic sign.]]
Although the Ladin communities are spread out over three neighbouring regions, the ''Union Generala di Ladins dles Dolomites'' is asking that they be reunited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generela.info/ Homepage of the Union Generala di Ladins dles Dolomites]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ladin Autonomist Union]] and the [[Fassa Association]] run on a Ladin list and have sought more rights and autonomy for Ladin speakers. Ladins are also guaranteed political representations in the assemblies of Trentino and South Tyrol due to a reserved seats system.

In South Tyrol, in order to reach a fair allocation of jobs in public service, a system called "ethnic proportion" was established in the 1970s. Every 10 years, when the general census of population takes place, each citizen has to identify with a linguistic group. The results determine how many potential positions in public service are allocated for each linguistic group. This has theoretically enabled Ladins to receive guaranteed representation in the South Tyrolean civil service according to their numbers.

The recognition of minority languages in Italy has been criticised since the implementation of Act No. 482 (1999), especially due to alleged financial benefits. This applies also to Ladin language, especially in the province of Belluno.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/magazine/lingua_italiana/speciali/minoranze/Toso_minor_ling.html] Fiorenzo Toso, Univ. di Sassari: ''I benefici (soprattutto di natura economica) previsti dalla legge482/1999 hanno indotto decine di amministrazioni comunali a dichiarare una inesistente appartenenza a questa o a quella minoranza: col risultato, ad esempio, che le comunità di lingua ladina si sono moltiplicate nel Veneto'' (financial benefits provided by the law 482/1999 led dozens of municipalities to declare a non-existent affiliation to some minority, resulting e.g. in a multiplication of the Ladin-speaking communities in the Veneto region)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdivisions==
A possible subdivision of Ladin language&lt;ref&gt;Mário Eduardo Viaro, ''O reto-românico: unidade e fragmentação. Caligrama. Belo Horizonte, 14: 101–156'', December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; identifies six major groups.

===Athesian Group of the Sella===
The dialects of the Athesian group (from the river [[Adige]] Basin) of the [[Sella group|Sella]] are spoken in South Tyrol:
* Gherdëina, spoken in [[Val Gardena]] by 8,148 inhabitants (80–90% of the population);
* Badiot and Maró, spoken in [[Val Badia]] and in [[Mareo]] by 9,229 people, i.e. 95%, as native language.

The South Tyrolean dialects are most similar to the original Ladin.

===Trentinian Group of the Sella===
The names of the Ladin dialects spoken in the [[Fassa Valley]] in Trentino are Moenat, Brach, and Cazet. 82.8% of the inhabitants of Fassa Valley are native Ladin speakers;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minoranzelinguistiche.provincia.tn.it/binary/pat_minoranze/minoranze/ladini_mocheni_cimbri_pop_2001_x_comune_e_residenza.1205943234.pdf Tav. I.5 appartenenza alla popolazione di lingua ladina (censimento 2001)], Annuario statistico della provincia autonoma di Trento 2006 – Tav. I.5&lt;/ref&gt; the Ladin language in Fassa is influenced by Trentinian dialects.

===Agordino Group of the Sella===
In the Province of Belluno the following dialects are considered as part of the Agordino group:
*[[Fodom]], also called [[Livinallese]], spoken in [[Livinallongo del Col di Lana]] and [[Colle Santa Lucia]], native language of 80–90% of the people;
*Rocchesano in the area of [[Rocca Pietore]]. While [[Laste|Laste di Sopra]] (Ladin ''Laste de Sora'') and Sottoguda (Ladin ''Stagùda'') are predominantly Ladin, in [[Alleghe]], [[San Tomaso]], and [[Falcade]] so-called Ladin-Venetian dialects are spoken, with strong Venetian influence;
* Ladin in the area of Agordo and [[Valle del Biois]], even if some regard it rather as Venetian-Ladin.

===Ampezzan Group===
Spoken in [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] (''Anpezo''), similar to [[Cadorino dialect]].

Even in [[Valle di Zoldo]] (from Forno-Fôr upwards) there are elements of the Ampezzan Group.

===Cadorino Group===
Spoken in [[Cadore]] and [[Comelico]] and best known as [[Cadorino dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Giovan Battista Pellegrini]], I dialetti ladino-cadorini, Miscellanea di studi alla memoria di [[Carlo Battisti]], Firenze, Istituto di studi per l'Alto Adige, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nones and Solandro Group===
In Western Trentino, in [[Non Valley]], [[Val di Sole]], [[Val di Peio]], [[Val di Rabbi]], and part of [[Val Rendena]], detached from the dolomitic area, dialects are spoken that are often considered to be part of the Ladin language (Anaunic Ladin), but enjoy strong influences from Trentinian and Eastern Lombard dialects.

===Låger / Nortades Group===
In other areas of South Tyrol, particularly in the [[South Tyrolean Unterland|Unterland]], the dialects of the towns of [[Kurtatsch]], [[Kurtinig]], [[Laag]], and [[Salurn]], are also often considered to be part of the Ladin language (Nortades Ladin). However, among the most important features of these dialects is the plural ending in ''i'' or ''e'' for masculine and feminine nouns (respectively) and a stronger influence of [[Tyrol]]ean - [[German language|German]] dialects.

'''Latvian Canadians''' are [[Canadians|Canadian citizens]] of [[Latvians|Latvian]] descent or [[Latvia]]n-born people who are in possession of [[Canadian citizenship]]. There are about 30,000 people of Latvian descent living in [[Canada]].

== History ==
Although by 1921 the Canadian government considered all persons from the [[Soviet Union]] to be [[Russians]], it is known that there were some Latvians living in Canada in those years, because in 1961, 379 Latvian indicated that they had arrived in Canada prior to 1921, and most probably left [[Latvia]] after the [[1905 Revolution]]. Between 1921 and 1945, 409 Latvians  arrived to Canada, although in the 1941 census listed 975 people claimed Latvian origin. 
After the [[Second World War]] in 1947, many Latvians moved to Canada as [[war refugees]]. This migration, which accounted for 92% of Latvians who immigrated to the country between 1921 and 1965, ended in 1957. Many of these Latvians worked in the agricultural areas during their first years in Canada, but soon settled in cities. By 1961, only 10% of those immigrants lived in rural zones and farms (6% in rural areas and 4% on farms). The majority of Latvian immigrants in Canada in 1991 were women, 775 more women than men.&lt;ref name="Demohis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/l3/2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130115172226/http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/l3/2 |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }} Multicultural Canada: Migration, Arrival, and Settlement. Retrieved January 05, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demography ==
Although  before 1939, 78 percent of Latvians lived in the three [[prairie provinces]], and only 12 percent in [[Ontario]], since 1945 over 70 percent of Latvians live in [[Ontario]] and only about 10 percent in [[Quebec]], while the prairie provinces have only had 11 percent of new Latvian immigrants. By 1991, 20,445 persons indicated they were of Latvian descent, most of them living in the capital, 14 percent in the prairie provinces, 12 percent in [[British Columbia]], 5.9 percent in Quebec, and 1.8 percent in the Atlantic region.

In 1991 the largest populations of Latvian Canadians are in [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ottawa]], and [[Montreal]], Quebec.&lt;ref name="Demohis"/&gt;

== Religion ==
Most Latvian Canadians are [[Christians]]: close to 90 percent are [[Lutheran]], 10 percent [[Roman Catholic]], and 1 percent [[Baptist]]. The organization of Lutheran congregations in Canada is in regional dioceses, which belong to the Lutheran Evangelical Church in Exile. In 1970 there were 1,400 Latvian-Canadian Roman Catholics. On a parish basis they are connected to the larger [[Roman Catholic Church in Canada]]. In the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto|Toronto archdiocese]] is The Association of Canadian Latvian Catholics, founded in 1949. On the other hand, Latvian Baptists are much less numerous in Canada: only 200. However they have a very active congregation in Toronto.&lt;ref name="Mulreli"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/l3/7 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130115163946/http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/l3/7 |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }} Multicultural Canada: Religion.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leo Lanzetta''' was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in 1895. Leo had five other brothers, with whom he formed a [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] and [[drug trafficking]] [[The Lanzetta Brothers|gang]]. He and his brothers were also called "the Lanzetti brothers" (due to incorrect documentation and newspaper retrieving incorrect information).

== Early life ==
Leo Lanzetta was born in [[South Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] in 1895 to [[Italian American]] parents Michele and Ignatius Lanzetta.&lt;ref name="Leo Lanzetta 1910 Census"/&gt; Leo had five other brothers: [[Ignatius Lanzetta|Ignatius]], Pius, Willie, Teo, and Lucien; Leo being the oldest and Pius being the second oldest.&lt;ref name="The Real People of Boardwalk Empire: Part 3"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Real People of Boardwalk Empire: Part 3|work= |date= September 2014 |url=https://historymaniacmegan.wordpress.com/2014/09/21/the-real-people-of-boardwalk-empire-part-3-henry-earl-j-hymie-weiss-to-santo-trafficante-sr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pius Lanzetta 1910 Census"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Pius 1910 Census Record|work= |date= March 2015|url=http://us-census.mooseroots.com/l/411355217/Pius-Lanzetta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prohibition ==
Leo formed [[The Lanzetta Brothers|the Lanzetta Gang]] with Ignatius, Pius, and their other brothers in the early 1920s. Leo, Ignatius, Pius, and their other brothers ran the gang. The brothers controlled [[rum-running|bootlegging]] in [[Little Italy, Philadelphia|Little Italy]].

They were allied with [[Italians|Italian]] [[gangster|gangsters]] Michael Falcone and Louis "Fats" Delrossi and their rivals included: [[Polish-American organized crime|Polish mob]] [[crime boss|boss]] [[Mickey Duffy|William Michael Cusick]], [[Sicilian Mafia]] and [[Philadelphia crime family|Bruno crime family]] boss [[Salvatore Sabella]], [[Jewish Mafia|Jewish mob]] boss [[Max Hoff (mobster)|Max "Boo Boo" Hoff]], and [[American Mafia|Italian Mafia]] [[made men|made man]] and rival [[drug trafficker|dope peddler]] and [[rum-runner|bootlegger]] [[Philadelphia crime family#John Avena and Joe Dovi|Joseph Bruno]].&lt;ref name="The Lanzetti's"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Lanzetti's-Philly's first drug dealers |work= |date=March 2015 |url=http://www.phillyneighbors.com/PhillyGangsters/index.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402075349/http://www.phillyneighbors.com/PhillyGangsters/index.htm |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lanzetta brothers ran their gang with extreme violence and expanded into [[drug trafficking]] and [[bookmaking|numbers writing]].

== Death ==
Leo and Ignatius murdered Joe Bruno on August 18, 1925, at 8th and Catherine Streets. Four days later, as Leo left a barbershop at 7th and Bainbridge Streets, an unknown assailant killed him in retaliation for the murder of Bruno.&lt;ref name="The Real People of Boardwalk Empire: Part 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Lanzetti's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mickey Duffy and the Lanzetta Brothers"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Mickey Duffy and the Lanzettta Brothers|work= |date= November 2010 |url=http://fikklefame.com/mickey-duffy-and-the-lanzetta-brothers/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabella is Leo's suspected killer.&lt;ref name="Salvatore Sabella"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Philly's first Godfather Salvatore Sabella Born in Sicily 1891. |work= |date=March 2015 |url=http://www.phillyneighbors.com/PhillyGangsters/index.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402075349/http://www.phillyneighbors.com/PhillyGangsters/index.htm |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television adaption ==
In [[Boardwalk Empire (season 1)|the first season]] of the [[HBO]] series [[Boardwalk Empire]],  Leo Lanzetta and his brothers are the inspiration for [[Nucky Thompson|Nucky Thompson's]] main rivals the ''D'Alessio brothers''. In the series, Leo is the inspiration for ''Leo D'Alessio'', the co-leader of the D'Alessio gang. In the series, his brothers are: Ignacius, Matteo, Lucien, Sixtus, Pius, and another brother in [[Philadelphia]] who is a [[dentist]]; the brothers also have several more sisters. In the last [[A Return to Normalcy|episode of season one]], Leo's throat is cut by Nucky's [[bodyguard]] [[Jimmy Darmody|James "Jimmy Irish" Darmody]] in November of 1920.

If a citizen wanted to report a crime, they went to the press, not to law enforcement; people who wanted to voice their political opposition sent their work for publication to newspapers, not to the Guatemalan government. By 1985, when Guatemala readopted its constitutional rule, press freedom began to improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smeets |title=Speaking Out: Postwar Journalism in Guatemala and El Salvador |url=http://cpj.org/reports/1999/08/guatemala11august99.php |publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]] |accessdate=2 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LYb4CPqq?url=http://cpj.org/reports/1999/08/guatemala11august99.php |archivedate=2 December 2013 |date=11 August 1999 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When a peace treaty was signed in 1996, the atmosphere improved for journalists in Guatemala and the killings of media workers dropped significantly.{{sfn|Rockwell|2003|p=176}} However, attacks against the press and targeted killings continued under the form of organized crime.{{sfn|Shea|2001|p=66}}

The end of the civil war made the Guatemalan press "free" in several aspects; newspapers began to publish articles about government corruption, a topic that was frequently avoided during the war-time era, in increasing numbers. Despite these improvements, journalists in Guatemala learned to adopt a culture of self-censorship that dates back to the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Kane|first=Trish|title=Guatemala in Focus: A Guide to the People, Politics and Culture|year=1999|publisher=[[Interlink Books]]|isbn=1566562422|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6heMlMW-aoC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=guatemala+media+censorship&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kgScUsjAPMyNkAf43IEw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=guatemala%20media%20censorship&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative attitudes from the government towards the Guatemalan press continue to exist, and the press lacks the economic independence to break away from the government and its advertisements and become fully autonomous.{{sfn|Shea|2001|p=68}} Most of the media outlets in the country are centered in [[Guatemala City]], the capital.{{sfn|Shea|2001|p=65}} Journalists who work in the capital have better working conditions and are better protected from attacks than those living in the provinces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attacks on the Press 2001: Guatemala |url=http://cpj.org/2002/03/attacks-on-the-press-2001-guatemala.php |publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]] |accessdate=2 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LYbLhN3G?url=http://cpj.org/2002/03/attacks-on-the-press-2001-guatemala.php |archivedate=2 December 2013 |deadurl=no |date=26 March 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where they are easily pressured by local officials for their direct reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attacks on the Press 2004: Guatemala |url=http://cpj.org/2005/03/attacks-on-the-press-2004-guatemala.php |publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]] |accessdate=2 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LYbTFJpS?url=http://cpj.org/2005/03/attacks-on-the-press-2004-guatemala.php |archivedate=2 December 2013 |deadurl=no |date=2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-2000s, drug-related violence and the presence of Mexican organized crime, in particular of [[Los Zetas]], has increased the number of homicides in Guatemala and attacks against the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lauría |first=Carlos |title=Drug Trade, Violent Gangs Pose Grave Danger |url=http://cpj.org/2009/02/drugs-violence-press-latin-america.php |publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]] |accessdate=2 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LYc4Prt8?url=http://cpj.org/2009/02/drugs-violence-press-latin-america.php |archivedate=2 December 2013 |deadurl=no |date=2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbot|first=Thomas|title=Violence against journalists in Guatemala spikes again|url=http://www.coha.org/violence-against-journalists-in-guatemala-spikes-again/|publisher=[[Council on Hemispheric Affairs]]|accessdate=2 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202050550/http://www.coha.org/violence-against-journalists-in-guatemala-spikes-again/|archivedate=2 December 2013|deadurl=no|date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sixteen-year-old teenage girl was [[Death by burning|burned to death]] in [[Río Bravo, Suchitepéquez]], [[Guatemala]] in May 2015 by a [[vigilante]] mob after being accused by some of involvement in the [[Homicide|killing]] of a [[Taxicab|taxi]] driver earlier in the month.

== Lynching ==

A crowd of at least one hundred people watched as she walked around burning and rolled on the ground crying for help. No one intervened to save the girl from the beating or to extinguish the fire. The girl lay on a main street in town and when the fire began dying out, an unidentified male ran out of the crowd and doused her body with fuel and her body was again engulfed in flames.

== Motivation for the attack ==

The attack was in retaliation for the girl's alleged involvement in the robbery and murder of a local taxi driver. Unidentified Rio Bravo residents{{who?|date=June 2016}} claimed she and two other men killed Carlos Enrique González Noriega, 68, moto taxi driver.&lt;ref name="LatinTimes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latintimes.com/guatemalan-villagers-burn-woman-who-was-suspected-assassin-318080 | title=Guatemalan Villagers Burn Woman Who Was Suspected Assassin | publisher=Latin Times | accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two male accomplices escaped. It is unknown whether she was involved or simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/27/americas/guatemala-girl-burned-mob/index.html|title=Video of mob burning teen in Guatemala spurs outrage|author=Annie Rose Ramos, Catherine E.

'''Mental rotation''' is the ability to [[rotate]] [[mental image|mental representations]] of [[dimension|two-dimensional]] and [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] objects as it is related to the visual representation of such rotation within the human mind.&lt;ref name="Shepard 701–703"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Roger N.|last2=Metzler|first2=Jacqueline|date=1971-02-19|title=Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/171/3972/701|journal=Science|language=en|volume=171|issue=3972|pages=701–703|doi=10.1126/science.171.3972.701|issn=0036-8075|pmid=5540314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Mental rotation, as a function of visual representation in the human brain, has been associated with the right [[cerebral hemisphere]]. There is a relationship between similar areas of the brain associated with [[perception]] and mental rotation.

Mental rotation has been studied to try to figure out how the mind recognizes objects in their environment. Researchers generally call such objects [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. Mental rotation is one cognitive function for the person to figure out what the altered object is.

Mental rotation can be separated into the following [[Cognition|cognitive]] stages:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Create a mental image of an object from all directions (imagining where it continues straight vs. turns)
# Rotate the object mentally until a comparison can be made (orientating the stimulus to other figure)
# Make the comparison
# Decide if the objects are the same or not
# Report the decision (reaction time is recorded when level pulled or button pushed)

==Assessment==
In a mental rotation [[Psychological assessment|test]], the participant compares two [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] objects (or [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]]), often rotated in some axis, and states if they are the same [[image]] or if they are [[mirror image]]s ([[Chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphs]]).&lt;ref name="Shepard 701–703"/&gt; Commonly, the test will have pairs of images each rotated a specific number of [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] (e.g. 0°, 60°, 120° or 180°). A set number of pairs will be split between being the same image rotated, while others are mirrored. The researcher judges the participant on how [[Accuracy|accurately]] and [[Rate (mathematics)|rapidly]] they can distinguish between the mirrored and non-mirrored pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What does the Mental Rotation Test Measure?

==Notable research==

=== Shepard and Metzler (1971) ===

[[Roger Shepard]] and Jacqueline Metzler (1971) were some of the first to research the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, R. N., &amp; Metzler, J., "Mental rotation: Effects of Dimensionality of Objects and Type of Task", ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance]]'', Vol 14, Feb 1988, pp. 3-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Their experiment specifically tested mental rotation on three-dimensional objects. Each subject was presented with multiple pairs of three-dimensional, asymmetrical lined or cubed objects. The experiment was designed to measure how long it would take each subject to determine whether the pair of objects were indeed the same object or two different objects. Their [[research]] showed that the [[reaction time]] for participants to decide if the pair of items matched or not was [[Linear#Linear functions|linearly]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[angle]] of rotation from the original position. That is, the more an object has been rotated from the original, the longer it takes an individual to determine if the two images are of the same object or enantiomorphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/1120/ps/ps3/mental-rotation.pdf|journal=Science|year=1971|author1=Shepard, R.

=== Vandenburg and Kuse (1978) ===
{{main|Mental Rotations Test}}
In 1978, [[Steven G. Vandenberg]] and Allan R. Kuse developed a test to assess mental rotation abilities that was based on Shepard and Metzler's (1971) original study. The [[Mental Rotations Test]] was constructed using India ink drawings. Each stimulus was a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional object drawn by a computer. The image was then displayed on an oscilloscope. Each image was then shown at different orientations rotated around the vertical axis. Following the basic ideas of Shepard and Metzler's experiment, this study found a significant difference in the mental rotation scores between men and women, with men performing better. Correlations with other measures showed strong association with tests of spatial visualization and no association with verbal ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandenberg|first=Steven|date=1978|title=Mental Rotations, a Group Test of Three-Dimensional Spatial Visualization|pmid=724398|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=47|issue=2|pages=599–604|doi=10.2466/pms.1978.47.2.599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Michael|date=2005-03-01|title=Sex differences and the factor of time in solving Vandenberg and Kuse mental rotation problems|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262604002398|journal=Brain and Cognition|volume=57|issue=2|pages=176–184|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2004.08.052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neural activity ==
In 1999, a study was conducted to find out which part of the brain is activated during mental rotation. Seven volunteers (four males and three females) between the ages of twenty-nine to sixty-six participated in this experiment. For the study, the subjects were shown eight characters 4 times each (twice in normal orientation and twice reversed) and the subjects had to decide if the character was in its normal configuration or if it was the mirror image. During this task, a PET scan was performed and revealed activation in the right posterior parietal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Irina M.|last2=Egan|first2=Gary F.|last3=Sonkkila|first3=Cynon|last4=Tochon-Danguy|first4=Henri J.|last5=Paxinos|first5=George|last6=Watson|first6=John D. G.|date=2000-01-01|title=Selective right parietal lobe activation during mental rotation|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/123/1/65|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=123|issue=1|pages=65–73|doi=10.1093/brain/123.1.65|issn=0006-8950|pmid=10611121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]]&amp;nbsp;studies of brain activation during mental rotation reveal consistent increased activation of the parietal lobe, specifically the inter-parietal sulcus, that is dependent on the difficulty of the task. In general, the larger the angle of rotation, the more brain activity associated with the task. This increased brain activation is accompanied by longer times to complete the rotation task and higher error rates. Researchers have argued that the increased brain activation, increased time, and increased error rates indicate that task difficulty is proportional to the angle of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|title=Mental rotation of tactile stimuli|journal= Cognitive Brain Research|volume=14|doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(02)00063-0|pages=91–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gogos|first=Andrea|last2=Gavrilescu|first2=Maria|last3=Davison|first3=Sonia|last4=Searle|first4=Karissa|last5=Adams|first5=Jenny|last6=Rossell|first6=Susan L.|last7=Bell|first7=Robin|last8=Davis|first8=Susan R.|last9=Egan|first9=Gary F.|date=2010-01-01|title=Greater superior than inferior parietal lobule activation with increasing rotation angle during mental rotation: An fMRI study|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393209004163|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=48|issue=2|pages=529–535|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.10.013|pmid=19850055}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Clock rotated depth wise 90 degrees.png|thumb|Rotation in depth 90 degrees]][[File:Clock rotated in the picture plane 90 degrees.png|thumb|Rotation in the picture plane 90 degrees]]

==Color==
Physical objects that people imagine rotating in everyday life have many properties, such as textures, shapes, and colors. A study at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]] was conducted to specifically test the extent to which visual information, such as color, is represented during mental rotation. This study used several methods such as reaction time studies, verbal protocol analysis, and eye tracking. In the initial reaction time experiments, those with poor rotational ability were affected by the colors of the image, whereas those with good rotational ability were not. Overall, those with poor ability were faster and more accurate identifying images that were consistently colored. The verbal protocol analysis showed that the subjects with low [[spatial ability]] mentioned color in their mental rotation tasks more often than participants with high spatial ability. One thing that can be shown through this experiment is that those with higher rotational ability will be less likely to represent color in their mental rotation. Poor rotators will be more likely to represent color in their mental rotation using piecemeal strategies (Khooshabeh &amp; Hegarty, 2008).

==Effect on athleticism and artistic ability==
Research on how athleticism and artistic ability affect mental rotation has also been done. Pietsch, S., &amp; Jansen, P. (2012) showed that people who were athletes or musicians had faster reaction times than people who were not. They tested this by splitting people from the age of 18 and higher into three groups. Group 1 was students who were studying math, sports students and education students. It was found that through the mental rotation test students who were focused on sports did much better than those who were math or education majors. Also it was found that the male athletes in the experiment were faster than females, but male and female musicians showed no significant difference in reaction time.

Moreau, D., Clerc, et al. (2012) also investigated if athletes were more spatially aware than non-athletes. This experiment took undergraduate college students and tested them with the mental rotation test before any sport training, and then again afterward. The participants were trained in two different sports to see if this would help their spatial awareness. It was found that the participants did better on the mental rotation test after they had trained in the sports, than they did before the training. There are ways to train your spatial awareness. This experiment brought to the research that if people could find ways to train their mental rotation skills they could perform better in high context activities with greater ease.

A study investigated the effect of mental rotation on postural stability. Participants performed a MR (mental rotation) task involving either foot stimuli, hand stimuli, or non-body stimuli (a car) and then had to balance on one foot. The results suggested that MR tasks involving foot stimuli were more effective at improving balance than hand or car stimuli, even after 60 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=a3da1b76-fd74-4640-abfb-c61d3a4ecdeb%2540sessionmgr4010&amp;hid=4107&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%253d%253d#AN=2016-29576-008&amp;db=psyh|title=Improvement of postural stability during quiet standing obtained after mental rotation of foot stimuli.|last=Kawasaki|first=Tsubasa|date=2017-07-11|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers studied the difference in mental rotation ability between gymnasts, handball, and soccer players with both in-depth and in-plane rotations. Results suggested that athletes were better at performing mental rotation tasks that were more closely related to their sport of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Effects of the axis of rotation and primordially solicited limb of high level athletes in a mental rotation task.|journal=Human Movement Science|volume=37|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hamdi_Habacha/publication/264241628_Effects_of_the_axis_of_rotation_and_primordially_solicited_limb_of_high_level_athletes_in_a_mental_rotation_task/links/5a107ee0a6fdccc2d79997bf/Effects-of-the-axis-of-rotation-and-primordially-solicited-limb-of-high-level-athletes-in-a-mental-rotation-task.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a correlation in mental rotation and motor ability in children, and this connection is especially strong in boys age 7–8. Children were known for having very connected motor and cognitive processes, and the study showed that this overlap is influenced by motor ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The role of rotational hand movements and general motor ability in children’s mental rotation performance.|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=6|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mental rotation test (MRT) was carried out on gymnasts, orienteers, runners, and non athletes. Results showed that non athletes were greatly outperformed by gymnasts and orienteers, but not runners. Gymnasts (egocentric athletes) did not outperform orienteers (allocentric athletes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gymnasts and orienteers display better mental rotation performance than nonathletes.|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|volume=37|doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender ==
Different studies have shown that there is a difference between male and female in mental rotation tasks.

In order to explain this difference, we can look at the brain activation during a mental rotation task. In 2012, a study&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; have been done on people that graduated in sciences or in liberal arts. Males and females were asked to execute a mental rotation task, and their brain activity was recorded with an fMRI. The researchers found a difference of brain activation: males present a stronger activity in the area of the brain used in a mental rotation task.

A study from 2008 showed that this difference occurs early during development. The experiment was done on 3- to 4-month-old infants using a 2D mental rotation task. They used a preference apparatus that consists of observing during how much time the infant is looking at the stimulus. They started by familiarizing the participants with the number "1" and its rotations. Then they showed them a picture of a "1" rotated and its mirror image. The study showed that males are more interested by the mirror image. Females are equally interested by the "1" rotated and its mirror image. According to the study, this may mean that males and females, at least when infants, process mental rotation differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quinn|first=Paul C.|last2=Liben|first2=Lynn S.|date=2008-11-01|title=A Sex Difference in Mental Rotation in Young Infants|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/19/11/1067|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=19|issue=11|pages=1067–1070|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02201.x|issn=0956-7976|pmid=19076474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study from 2015 was focused on women and their abilities in a mental rotation task and in an emotion recognition task. In this experiment, they induced a feeling or a situation in which women feel more powerful or less powerful. They were able to conclude that women in a situation of power are better in a mental rotation task (but less performant in an emotion recognition task) than other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissan|first=Tali|last2=Shapira|first2=Oren|last3=Liberman|first3=Nira|date=2015-10-01|title=Effects of Power on Mental Rotation and Emotion Recognition in Women|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/41/10/1425|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=41|issue=10|pages=1425–1437|doi=10.1177/0146167215598748|issn=0146-1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studying differences between male and female brains can have interesting applications. For example, it could help in the understanding of the [[autism spectrum disorders]].

One of the theories concerning autism is the EMB ([[extreme male brain]]). This theory considers that autist have an "extreme male brain". In a study&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zapf|first=Alexandra C.|last2=Glindemann|first2=Liv A.|last3=Vogeley|first3=Kai|last4=Falter|first4=Christine M.|date=2015-04-17|title=Sex Differences in Mental Rotation and How They Add to the Understanding of Autism|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124628|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=4|pages=e0124628|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0124628|issn=1932-6203|pmid=25884501|pmc=4401579}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2015, researchers confirmed that there is a difference between male and female in mental rotation task (by studying people without autism): Males are more successful. Then they highlighted the fact that autists do not have this "male performance" in a mental rotation task. They conclude their study by "autistic people do not have an extreme version of a male cognitive profile as proposed by the EMB theory".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

There may be relationships between competent bodily movement and the speed with which individuals can perform mental rotation.

Milk paint has been used for thousands of years. It is extremely durable, often lasting for hundreds of years if protected from the elements. It is made of all-natural ingredients, and is very safe and non-toxic once applied. Because oil base and acrylic paints are made in vast quantities using cheap petrochemicals, their price can be low relative to the price of milk paint, which is sold in small quantities. Another impediment to using milk paint for some is that it does not come pre-mixed.&lt;ref Name="staff"&gt;{{cite web

Before the invention of acrylics, most house paints were made from casein. There is a vast number of historical production documents that outline the manufacture of milk paint on an industrial scale. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/944390964|title=Casein : its preparation and technical utilisation.|last=Robert.|first=Scherer,|date=2010|publisher=Nabu Press|isbn=9781178313543|oclc=944390964}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of manufacturing is being revived on a small scale, so that the advantages of an all natural paint can be combined with the convenience of a ready made paint that requires no mixing.

Milk paint made from the borax casein recipe keeps for six months or more, if sealed very tightly to retain the moisture. With time, however, the casein binder will break down. Once lime casein milk paint has been mixed, it must be used within a day, or a little longer if refrigerated.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book

'''Participatory development communication''' is the use of [[mass media]] and traditional, inter-personal means of communication that empowers communities to visualise aspirations and discover solutions to their development problems and issues.

'''Participatory communication''' is "the theory and practices of communication used to involve people in the [[decision-making]] of the development process. It intends to return to the roots of its meaning, which, similarly to the term community, originate from the Latin word 'communis', i.e. common (Mody, 1991). Therefore, the purpose of communication should be to make something common, or to share...meanings, perceptions, worldviews or knowledge. In this context, sharing implies an equitable division of what is being shared, which is why communication should almost be naturally associated with a balanced, two-way flow of information."{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}
* Strengthen a regional training capacity to improve the development support communication (DSC) skills of intermediate-level professionals so that they could improve the effectiveness of the rural development programmes in which they work.
* Initiate an example of a sustainable national DSC service to support rural development programmes and projects.
* Advance towards the creation of a group of DSC professionals in the region, by means of preparing a regional Post-graduate DSC Professional Diploma Course (through collaboration with the University of Zimbabwe in Harare).
* Advise governments and other development-related organisations about the requirements for effective DSC in Southern Africa, for future action.

Based on a "Results" section which synthesises and recaps the main issues by reviewing how the conception and levels of participation identified in his research have shifted in each phase of the project, Mefalopulos concludes by arguing that participatory communication is an approach capable of facilitating people's involvement in decision-making about issues impacting their lives – a process capable of addressing specific needs and priorities relevant to people and at the same time assisting in their empowerment. In fact, he says, participatory communication is "a necessary component, consistent with a democratic vision of international development, needed to increase projects sustainability and ensure genuine ownership by the so-called 'beneficiaries'."

==Six phases of planning==

Communication planning for development is a logical process guided by a systematic and rational framework. This framework could be developed through situation-specific data gathered using participatory research techniques.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Preliminary situation assessment===
Situation assessment could be done most effectively in a participatory manner through PRCA or participatory rural communication appraisal. Three kinds of analysis are done in PRCA: audience analysis, programme analysis, and situation analysis.
Audience analysis Audience analysis is essentially "listening" to what potential users of information need. They are the ones whom the communication program intends to reach. Users of information are also referred to as stakeholders of a communication program. Collecting baseline information about these stakeholders is an essential preliminary step towards developing a communication strategy.
Segmentation, or dividing large groups of stakeholders into smaller groups, helps achieve focus in communication strategy development. Segmentation is usually done in two ways:
* Conventional segmentation according to socio-economic status (income, education, age, sex, etc.), place of residence (urban-rural), and language/ethnic group
* Innovative segmentation based on behaviour, needs, and values and lifestyles.
* Situation analysis: In doing situation analysis, planners look at both the possible problem to be addressed by the communication program and the conditions surrounding such problem.

What are the factors which cause a gap between the existing and desired behavior of stakeholders? Is the problem due to the stakeholders' lack of awareness or knowledge of the nature of the problem? Or is it attitudinal in nature? Could the gap be due to their lack of skills to carry out certain practices?
Situation analysis likewise includes assessing the communication resources in the area which could be tapped for the communication program. Knowledge of the area's mass and small media, as well as interpersonal means of communication, should contribute substantially to strategy development.
Programme analysis
When doing program analysis, program planners need to take both an inward and an outward look at the situation that is, looking at the organization's own vision, policies, resources, strengths, and weaknesses relevant to the problem.
Are there adequate resources to realize this vision? How well are program managers using available resources? At the same time, it is important to scan the environment for existing programs that could affect, positively or negatively, the communication strategy to be developed.

===Communication strategy design===
Data that have been collected need to be analyzed and interpreted carefully as these will serve as bases of the communication strategy. Communication strategy is the combination of methods, messages, and approaches by which the planner seeks to achieve the communication objectives.
The second phase of the process charts the direction of the communication program. It is at this stage where objectives and the corresponding standards and indicators for [[Monitoring and Evaluation|monitoring and evaluation]] are formulated.
The very word strategy suggests a unique combination of techniques or approaches by which to achieve program goals and objectives.
During strategy design formulation, planners also begin thinking of the following:
* Preliminary action plan;
* Communication modes/approaches; and
* Basic messages and discussion themes.

===Participatory design of messages and discussion themes===
The main activities under the message design phase are selection of message appeals and approaches and selection of communication channels and media. The big challenge at this stage is the development of the big idea or the creative concept around which the whole communication program would revolve.
Professional communication outfits are often tapped to develop messages and communication materials for the above-mentioned processes. The disadvantage of this approach, aside from the huge expense involved, is the lack of participation from the stakeholders themselves.
Involving the stakeholders in message and materials development increases the likelihood that the communication program would help achieve the bigger development goals.

===Communication methods and materials development===
Actual development of communication methods and materials are undertaken once the communication strategy is in place.
A useful reminder to planners concerns the importance of pretesting not only the materials themselves, but also the creative idea and the messages. Pretesting allows for adjustments in the communication activities before substantial time, efforts, and resources are spent on their actual production.
Pretesting measures potential effectiveness of communication messages, methods, and materials in terms of their being able to attract attention, to be understood, to be accepted, and to generate the feeling of self-involvement among the stakeholders.

===Management and implementation===
Management of the organization carrying out the communication program and networking are two of the most important activities in this phase.
A manager's internal task entails preparing or training people for their respective tasks in the organization within a positive organizational climate. The external task calls for forging linkages with key organizations engaged in the same area of development work.
After all the preparatory stages, launching and carrying out the communication campaign or program now takes priority. Together with this come monitoring the process of dissemination, transmission, and reception of programme inputs.
The management aspect also covers the management improvement process and the concept of leadership as they affect implementation of communication programmes.

===Monitoring and evaluation===
Monitoring enables the planners and implementors to answer the question: Are things going all right? Evaluation, on the other hand, provides answers to the question: So, did it work?
Together, monitoring and evaluation help planners and implementors:
* Achieve better understanding of how the communication programme is working;
* Make informal decisions regarding operations and adjust to changing conditions;
* Ensure most effective and efficient use of resources;
* Look at the extent to which the program/project is having or has had the desired impact; and
* Fine-tune future programme impact.
To help gauge programme impact on stakeholders, it is important to set up clear standards and indicators based on the objectives set. How much have the activities contributed to achieving objectives of key organizations? This can be gauged by comparing evaluation with baseline data, specifically those gathered during the PRCA.
More importantly, monitoring and evaluation data contribute to planning for program sustainability and self-sufficiency.

==Types of participation==

Participation can be used as a goal or as a tool for specific projects.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tufte, Mefalopulos|first=Thomas, Paolo|title=Participatory Communication|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTDEVCOMMENG/Resources/Participatorycommunication.pdf|publisher=The World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four categories below refer to different levels of participation and communication:

===Passive participation===
The stakeholders of a project essentially act as "empty vessels" and receive information. Feedback is minimal if at all and participation is assessed through methods such as head counts.

===Participation by consultation===
Researchers or "experts" pose questions to the stakeholders. Input can be provided at different points in time but the final analysis and decision-making power lies in the hands of the external professionals whom may or may not take the stakeholders' decisions into consideration.

===Participation by collaboration===
Groups of primary stakeholders are formed in order to participate in discussion and analysis. Objectives are predetermined. This method incorporates components of horizontal communication and capacity building among all stakeholders.

===Empowerment participation===
Primary stakeholders are capable and willing to become involved in the process and take part in decision-making. Outsiders are equal partners, but the stakeholders make the final decisions as ownership and control of the process rests in their hands. Knowledge exchange leads to solutions.

==Minga Peru case study==

Minga Peru is a non-profit organization formed to address issues of "social justice, gender equality, reproductive health, and human rights". Minga has targeted the northern Loreto region for its development of "communicative spaces" which hope to spark debate and participation from the community. In order to achieve these goals they have produced a radio program, started a community empowerment and leadership program and supported income generating activities.

These activities are community-based approaches as evidenced by editorial letters being sent to the radio program, use of youth correspondents which provides the community with access to and voice within the broadcast, and emphasis on social networking which has resulted in stronger social cohesion. The most prominent outcomes in the empowerment of women through self-confidence. Women are better able to develop professional and social networks and have improved capacity to handle health challenges.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The first dynasty of the Persian Empire was created by [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]], established by [[Cyrus the Great]] in 550 BC with the conquest of [[Medes|Median]], [[Lydia]]n and [[Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Histories |last= Herodotus |first= |publisher= |year= |isbn= 978-0143107545 |chapter= Halicarnassus |pages= (page needed) }}&lt;/ref&gt; It covered much of the Ancient world when it was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. [[Persepolis]] is the most famous historical site related to Persian Empire in the Achaemenid era and it has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979.

==Parthians and Sasanians==
From 247&amp;nbsp;BC to 224&amp;nbsp;AD, Persia was ruled by the [[Parthian Empire]], which supplanted the [[Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid Empire]], and then by the [[Sassanian Empire]], which ruled up until the mid-7th century.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the World in 1,000 Objects'' (DK Publishing, 2014). p.&amp;nbsp;71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persian Empire in the Sasanian era was interrupted by the [[Arab conquest of Persia]] in 651&amp;nbsp;AD, establishing the even larger Islamic [[caliphate]], and later by the [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia|Mongol invasion]]. The main religion of ancient Persia was the native [[Zoroastrianism]], but after the seventh century, it was slowly replaced by [[Islam]] which achieved a majority in the 10th century.

==Safavids==
[[File:Shah Abbas I engraving by Dominicus Custos.jpg|thumb|[[Shah Abbas I]], the most powerful king of the [[Safavid dynasty]]]]
The [[Safavid Empire]] was the first Persian Empire established after the Arab conquest of Persia by [[Shah Ismail I]]. From their base in [[Ardabil]], the Safavid Persians established control over parts of [[Greater Iran|Greater Persia/Iran]] and reasserted the Persian identity of the region, becoming the first native Persian dynasty since the Sasanian Empire to establish a unified Persian state. 

Literature, art and architecture flourished in the Safavid era once again, and it is often cited as the "rebirth of the Persian Empire". Safavids also announced Shia Islam as the official religion in the empire versus the Sunni Islam in the neighbouring Ottoman Empire.

Safe deposit boxes are generally located in [[bank]]s, [[post office]]s or other institutions. Safe deposit boxes are used to store valuable possessions, such as [[gemstone]]s, [[precious metal]]s, [[currency]], marketable securities, [[Luxury goods]], important documents (e.g. [[Will (law)|will]]s, property [[deed]]s, or [[birth certificate]]s), or [[computer data storage|computer data]], that need protection from [[theft]], [[fire]], [[flood]], [[tampering (crime)|tampering]], or other perils. In the [[United States]], neither banks nor the FDIC insure the contents. An individual can purchase [[insurance]] for the safe deposit box in order to cover e.g. theft, fire, flooding or terrorist attacks.

'''Singkil''' people are an ethnic group of people found in [[Aceh Singkil Regency]] and [[Subulussalam]], [[Aceh]] province, [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Library Information and Research Service|title=The Middle East: Abstracts and index, Part 4|year=2004|publisher=Northumberland Press|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The customs and culture of the Singkil people are very different from the [[Pakpak people]]. This is because of the Singkil people practices [[Islam]], whereas the majority of the [[Pakpak people]] practices [[Christianity]]. Apart from that the Singkil people have intermarried with the neighbouring ethnic group of people like [[Acehnese people]] and [[Minangkabau people]].&lt;ref name="S"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nabilberri.wordpress.com/2012/11/14/suku-singkil/ |title=Singkil |author=Mulyadi Kombih |publisher=Blog Si Gam Acèh |accessdate=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
[[Singkil language]] is widely spoken in [[Aceh Singkil Regency]], [[Subulussalam]] and part of [[Southeast Aceh Regency]]. The [[Singkil language]] is very similar to [[Pakpak language]] of [[North Sumatra]]. However, the [[Singkil language]] have its own uniqueness whereby the alphabet "R" is pronounce as "kh". For example, the word "appearance" in [[Bahasa Indonesia]] is ''Rupa'', while in [[Singkil language]] it is ''Khupa''.

== Culture ==
The culture of the Singkil people itself has been greatly influenced by Islamic traditions. Although they may belong to the same clusters of parent-ethnic, the culture of the [[Pakpak people]] is vastly different from the Singkil people. This is because the Singkil people are mostly Muslims, while majority of the [[Pakpak people]] are Christians. Apart from that, mix marriages among the Singkil people with other foreign ethnics such as [[Acehnese people]] and [[Minangkabau people]] occurs more frequently.&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;

== Religion ==
[[Islam]] is believed to have spread in lands of the Singkil people a few centuries ago by foreign merchants that came from [[Minangkabau Highlands]] and later during the rule of the [[Aceh Sultanate]]. Many of the [[Minangkabau people]] have left traces of their history and their descendants in the coastline region. Abdurrauf Singkil, also known as Syekh Abdur Rauf as-Singkili was once a famous Singkil [[ulama]] that was appointed as a head [[ulama]] and a [[mufti]] in the Acehnese kingdom in 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douwe Adolf Rinkes|title=Abdoerraoef Van Singkel. Bijdrage Tot de Kennis Van de Mystiek Op Sumatra en Java. Academisch Proefschrift, Etc|year=1909|publisher=Leiden|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surnames ==
Just as with other sub-ethnic [[Batak people]], the ''[[Marga (Batak)|marga]]'' (family name or surname) of the Singkil people derives from the patrilineal lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Junus Melalatoa|title=Ensiklopedi Suku Bangsa di Indonesia Jilid L-Z|year=1995|publisher=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan|isbn=|page=784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the ''[[Marga (Batak)|margas]]'' that are used by the Singkil people are similar to those used by the [[Pakpak people]], [[Alas people]], [[Kluet people]] and part of [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo people]] along with [[Toba Batak people|Toba people]]. Nevertheless, there are ''[[Marga (Batak)|margas]]'' that are different. Several of the ''[[Marga (Batak)|margas]]'' that are found among the Singkil people includes:-
* Kombih (Kumbi)
* Ramin
* Buluara
* Palis (Pelis)
* Manik
* Kembang
* Kesugihen
* Lingga
* Bako
* Ujung
* Sulin (Solin)
There are also a number of Singkil ''[[Marga (Batak)|margas]]'' that originates from the descendants of the [[Minangkabau people]] that have assimilated with the Singkil people centuries ago, such as:-
* Melayu
* Goci

'''''Universelles Leben e.V. v. Germany''''' (application No. 29745/96) was a case decided by the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] in 1996.

==Facts==
''Universelles Leben'', the [[Germany|German]] branch of [[Universal Life]], filed a request in German court for an interim injunction prohibiting the German Government from including a reference to the applicant association in a publication on "So-called youth sects and psycho-groups in the Federal Republic of Germany"&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=F7UQfYra0msC&amp;pg=PT8&amp;lpg=PT8&amp;dq=So-called+youth+sects+and+psycho-groups+in+the+Federal+Republic+of+Germany&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bDvc0X_SiN&amp;sig=9-XnHlX3AQAmmxUOD9zu7ZJ7PmI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQs7ivl73QAhVC2IMKHQ4qBtwQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=So-called%20youth%20sects%20and%20psycho-groups%20in%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; until a final court's decision on prohibiting the reference. The interim injunction was granted by the [[Cologne]] Administrative Court.

After a government appeal of the injunction, the [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] Administrative Court of Appeal dismissed UL's request. It found that the documents produced by UL, in particular on the replacement of medical treatment by religious belief, showed a degree of danger for the general public justifying a reference to the applicant association in the envisaged publication including a warning about its activities.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=GTjaBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=So-called+youth+sects+and+psycho-groups+in+the+Federal+Republic+of+Germany&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Arsi-RdkvC&amp;sig=3LUB0DxsNHTf3F-6h25L9ROWyC8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQs7ivl73QAhVC2IMKHQ4qBtwQ6AEILDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=So-called%20youth%20sects%20and%20psycho-groups%20in%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
The commission considered that ''a State [..] is entitled to convey, in an objective, but critical manner, information on religious communities and sects, if such information does not pursue aims of agitation or indoctrination endangering the freedom of religion'' and that ''the reference to the applicant association in the intended publication does not have any direct repercussions on the religious freedom of the association or its members''. Therefore it held that there was no interference with the applicant association's rights to freedom of religion under [[Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights]].

'''Women in Libya''' are women who were born in, who live in, or are from [[Libya]].

==Society under dictatorship==
The roles and status of women had then become the subject of a great deal of discussion and legal action in Libya after the change of rule, as they have in many countries of the Middle East. Some observers suggested that the regime made efforts on behalf of female emancipation because it viewed women as an essential source of labour in an economy chronically starved for workers. They also postulated that the government was interested in expanding its political base, hoping to curry favour by championing female rights. Since independence, Libyan leaders have been committed to improving the condition of women but within the framework of Arabic and Islamic values.&lt;ref name=L /&gt; Central to the revolution of 1969 was the empowerment of women and removal of inferior status.&lt;ref name=LB /&gt;

===Emancipation===
In the 1970s, female emancipation was in large measure a matter of age. One observer generalized that city women under the age of thirty-five had discarded the traditional veil and were quite likely to wear Western-style clothing. Those between the ages of thirty-five and forty-five were increasingly ready to consider such a change, but women over the age of forty-five appeared reluctant to give up the protection which they perceived their veils and customary dress to afford. A decade later, veiling was uncommon among urban women. &lt;ref name=L /&gt;

During this era, women were also increasingly seen driving, shopping, or travelling without husbands or male companions (known as [[Mahram]]s).

====Voting and government====
Since 1964, Libyan women have had the right to vote and to participate in political life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIBYA MENA Gender Equality Profile - Unicef|url=https://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Libya-Gender-Eqaulity-Profile-2011.pdf|website=UNICEF|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birke|first1=Sarah|title=At a glance: women's rights in Libya|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/africa/at-a-glance-women-s-rights-in-libya-1.433928|website=The National|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Omar|first1=Manal|title=Women in Libya and the Arab Spring|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/manal-omar/arab-spring-libya-women_b_1076873.html|website=The World Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; They could also own and dispose of property independently of their husbands, but all of these rights were exercised by only a few women before the 1969 revolution.

Since then, the government has encouraged women to participate in elections and national political institutions, but in 1987 only one woman had advanced as far as the national cabinet, as an assistant secretary for information and culture.&lt;ref name=L /&gt; However, from 1989 to 1994 Fatima Abd al-Hafiz Mukhtar served as Minister of Education. Salma Ahmed Rashed, from 1992 to 1994, 
served as Assistant Secretary of Women, then as Secretary in the General Secretariat of the [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General Peoples' Congress]] for Women's Affairs from 1994 to 1995, and was eventually the Ambassador to the [[League of Arab Nations]] in 1996. Others serving as Secretary in the General Secretariat of the General Peoples' Congress for Women's Affairs included from 1995 to 1998 Thuriya Ramadan Abu Tabrika, Nura Han Ramadan Abu Sefrian from 1998 to 2000, Dr. Shalma Chabone Abduljabbar, and Amal Nuri Abdullah al-Safar from 2006 to 2009. Women serving as Secretary in the General Secretariat of the General Peoples' Congress for Social Affairs have included Dr. Shalma Chabone Abduljabbar and Abd-al-Alim al-Shalwi, while from 1995 to 2000 Fawziya Bashir al-Shalababi served as Secretary for Information, Culture and Mass Mobilization. Dr. Huda Fathi Ben Amer began serving as the Secretary of People's Committees Affairs in 2009, and also served as President of the [[Transitional Arab Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/news-e/wop/35/5.htm "Fifth meeting of women Speakers of Parliament"], The World of Parliaments. Quarterly Review. September 2009. Accessed June 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Salma Shabaan Abdel Jabar began serving as Secretary of Woman Affairs in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/Libya.htm "Great Arab Socialist Peoples' Republic of Libya"], Guide 2 WomenLeaders. Accessed June 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Association====
Women were also able to form their own associations. The first associated was in 1955 in Benghazi. In 1970, several feminist organizations merged into the Women's General Union which in 1977 became the Jamahiriya Women's Federation. Under Clause 5 of the Constitutional Proclamation of December 11, 1969, women had already been given equal status under the law with men. Subsequently, the women's movement has been active in such fields as adult education and hygiene.&lt;ref name=L /&gt;

====Employment====
Women had also made great gains in employment outside the home, the result of improved access to education and of increased acceptance of female paid employment. Once again, the government was the primary motivating force behind this phenomenon. For example, the 1976–80 development plan called for employment of a larger number of women "in those spheres which are suitable for female labour", but the Libyan identification of what work was suitable for women continued to be limited by tradition. According to the 1973 census, the participation rate for women (the percent of all women engaged in economic activity) was about 3 percent as compared with 37 percent for men. The participation was somewhat higher than the 2.7 percent registered in 1964, but it was considerably lower than that in other Maghrib countries and in most of the Middle Eastern Arab states.&lt;ref name=L /&gt;

In the 1980s, in spite of the gain registered by women during the prior decade, females constituted only 7 percent of the national labour force, according to one informed researcher. This represented a 2 percent increase over a 20-year period. Another source, however, considered these figures far too low. Reasoning from 1973 census figures and making allowances for full- and part-time, seasonal, paid, and unpaid employment, these researchers argued convincingly that women formed more than 20 percent of the total economically active Libyan population. For rural areas their figure was 46 percent, far higher than official census numbers for workers who in most cases were not only unpaid but not even considered as employed.&lt;ref name=L /&gt;

Among non-agricultural women, those who were educated and skilled were overwhelmingly employed as teachers. The next highest category of educated and skilled women ware nurses and those found in the health care field. Others areas that were open to women included administrative and clerical work in banks, department stores, and government offices and domestic services. Women were found in ever larger numbers as nurses and midwives, but even so, Libyan health care facilities suffered from a chronic shortage of staff.&lt;ref name=L /&gt;

By contrast, in clerical and secretarial jobs, the problem was not a shortage of labour but a deep-seated cultural bias against the intermingling of men and women in the workplace. During the 1970s, the attraction of employment as domestics tended to decline, as educated and ambitious women turned to more lucrative occupations. To fill the gap, Libyan households sought to hire foreigners, particularly Egyptians and Tunisians.&lt;ref name=L /&gt;

Light industry, especially cottage-style, was yet another outlet for female labour, a direct result of Libya's labour shortage. Despite these employment outlets and gains, female participation in the work force of the 1980s remained small, and many socially female jobs were filled by foreign women. Also, in spite of significant increases in female enrollments in the educational system, including university level, few women were found, even as technicians, in such traditionally male fields as medicine, engineering, and law.&lt;ref name=L /&gt;

Non-urban women constituted a quite significant, if largely invisible, proportion of the rural work force. According to the 1973 census, there were only l4, 000 economically active women out of a total of 200,000 rural females older than age 10. In all likelihood, however, many women engaged in agricultural or domestic tasks worked as unpaid members of family groups and hence were not regarded as gainfully employed, accounting to at least in part for the low census count. Estimates of actual female rural employment in the mid 1970s, paid and unpaid ranged upward of 86,000, as compared with 96,000 men in the rural work force. In addition to agriculture, both rural and nomadic women engaged in the weaving of rugs and carpets, another sizable category of unpaid and unreported labor.&lt;ref name=L /&gt;

Beginning in 1970, the revolutionary government passed a series of laws regulating female employment - equal pay for equal work and qualifications became a fundamental precept.&lt;ref name=L /&gt; Other statutes strictly regulate the hours and conditions of work, specifically the prohibition of hard labor, and 48 hours.&lt;ref name=WR /&gt;

=====Childcare and retirement benefits=====
Working mothers enjoyed a range of benefits designed to encourage them to continue working even after marriage and childbirth, including cash bonuses for the first child and free day care centres. A woman could retire at age fifty-five, and she was entitled to a pension.&lt;ref name=L&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aRNVYtHo63IC "Libya"], Helen Chapin Metz. Kessinger Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4191-3012-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4191-3012-0}}. p. 111-115&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Business and finance=====
Women are free to engage in the private business and finance sectors, and banks to not require the consent of the husband to obtain a loan.&lt;ref name=WR /&gt;

=====21st century=====
Employment was estimated at 22% for Libyan women by the early 21st century,&lt;ref name=LR /&gt; and 27% by 2006, relatively high for an Arab nation.&lt;ref name=WI /&gt; This marked a 14% increase since 1986.&lt;ref name=WI&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/thestar/women-indebted-to-gaddafi-for-power-1.1081074 "Women indebted to Gaddafi for power"], ''[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]''. June 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Employment by women in Libya is largely influenced by choice.&lt;ref name=WR /&gt; Positions in all fields of the economy were held, including lawyers, doctors, judges, and senior government positions.&lt;ref name=LR /&gt;

In May 2011, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported during the [[2011 Libyan civil war|Libyan civil war]] that the rebels had begun rolling back this progress as their size increased. One Libyan woman, a 23-year-old therapist, quit the rebel [[National Transitional Council]] saying when the revolution started, women had a big role, but it had disappeared.&lt;ref name=LR&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/world/africa/20benghazi.html "Libya Revolt Sidelines Women, Who Led It"], Kareem Fahim. ''[[New York Times]]''. May 19, 2011. Accessed June 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Education====
Under [[Idris of Libya|King Idris]], educating women was considered suspicious. During the last decade of his rule, females enrolled in primary education was only between 11-19%. Under Article 14 of the Libyan Constitutional Declaration in 1969, education was made a right, and by 1990 the figure stood at 48%. Enrollment in higher education stood at 8% in 1966, but reached 43% by 1996, equal to males.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8iw-OlGJsJ8C "The Libyan economy: economic diversification and international repositioning"], Waniss A. Otman, Erling Karlberg. Springer, 2007. {{ISBN|3-540-46460-3}}, {{ISBN|978-3-540-46460-0}}. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2001, 16% had a university degree or higher, and 48% a secondary school certificate, in which there is no prohibition on choice educational studies.&lt;ref name=WR /&gt;

====Housing====
At the time of the revolution in 1969, 40% of the population lived in tents or shanty houses and was one of the worst in the [[Arab]] world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mL6v8novFFIC "Terrorism and the state: a critique of domination through fear"], William D.

====Healthcare====
Following the revolution in 1969, [[universal healthcare]] services were created through the [[National Social Insurance Institute]], with women having equal access.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5spje12_is4C "Women's rights in the Middle East and North Africa: citizenship and justice"], Sameena Nazir, Leigh Tomppert.

Libya had one of the best healthcare systems in Africa before the 1992 U.N. sanctions, which rapidly declined the quality of medicine and supplies.&lt;ref name=LB&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_l87ixBRpKIC "Libya"], Peter Malcolm, Elizabeth Losleben. Marshall Cavendish, 2004. {{ISBN|0-7614-1702-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7614-1702-6}}. p. 73, 76, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

====Culture====
By the 1980s relations within the family and between the sexes, along with all other aspects of Libyan life, had begun to show notable change. As the mass media popularized new ideas, new perceptions and practices appeared. Foreign settlers and foreign workers frequently embodied ideas and values distinctively different from those traditional in the country. In particular, the perceptions of Libyans in everyday contact with Europeans were affected.

The continued and accelerating process of urbanization had broken old kinship ties and association with ancestral rural communities. At the same time, opportunities for upward social movement have increased, and petroleum wealth and the development plans of the revolutionary government have made many new kinds of employment available thus opening up more well paid jobs for women especially among the educated young. Many of these educated and increasingly independent young women preferred to set up their own households at marriage, rather than live with their in-laws. In addition social security, free medical care, education, and other appurtenances of the welfare state had lessened the dependence of the aged on their children in village communities and had almost eliminated it in the cities.

====Military====
As of the late 20th century the regime had sought to introduce women into the armed forces. In the 1978 Libya's new military academy began training women, training thousands since.&lt;ref name=GH /&gt; In the early 1980s where the 'Nuns of the Revolution' were created as a specialist police force attached to revolutionary committees.&lt;ref name=L /&gt; Then in 1984, a law mandating female conscription that required all students in secondary schools and above to participate in military training was passed.&lt;ref name=L /&gt; In addition, young women were encouraged to attend female military academies, the first of which was established in 1979. These proposals originated with Colonel Gaddafi, who hoped that they would help create a new image and role for Libyan women everywhere. Nonetheless, the concept of female training in the martial arts encountered such widespread opposition that meaningful compliance seemed unlikely.

====Marriage====
Child brides were banned, and the minimum legal age to marry placed at 18.&lt;ref name=GH&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tH_ThgVEoAcC "God has ninety-nine names: reporting from a militant Middle East"], Judith Miller.
