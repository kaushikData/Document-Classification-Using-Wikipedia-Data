'''''Alam al-Jabarut''''' ({{lang-ar|عالم الجبروت}}, meaning the world of power&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Glassé, Huston Smith ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'' Rowman Altamira 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-759-10190-6}} page 145&lt;/ref&gt;) is the highest realm in [[Islamic cosmology]]. The realm ''[[Malakut|Al-Malakut]]'' is below ''Alam al Jabarut'', but still higher than ''[[Alam al Mulk]]''. The higher realms impinge the realms below and are not separated worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-815-65070-6}} page 6&lt;/ref&gt; Although some scholars were not able to see any difference between ''Alam al Jabarut'' and ''Al-Malakut'',&lt;ref&gt;N. Hanif ''Biographical Encyclopaedia of Sufis: Central Asia and Middle East'' Sarup &amp; Sons 2002 {{ISBN|978-8-176-25266-9}} page 307&lt;/ref&gt; others thought this to be the realm of [[Islamic view of angels|angels]] and [[Ruh|spirits]] and the other a realm below. Thus this realm is also considered to be the created aspect of ''[[Rasul]]'' and the created reality of [[Adam in Islam|Adam]], here representing the ''perfect human'' ([[Al-Insān al-Kāmil]]).

==Angelic realm==
While angels also dwell in ''Al-Malakut'' to encounter humans and perform tasks on earth, the most elected angels inhabit ''Al-Jabarut''.&lt;ref&gt;N. Hanif ''Biographical Encyclopaedia of Sufis: Central Asia and Middle East'' Sarup &amp; Sons 2002 {{ISBN|978-8-176-25266-9}} page 307&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this is the domain of angelic manifestations and therefore the realm of ''archetypes'', ''thrones'' and ''powers'' and also the [[jannah|paradise]] of the [[afterlife]], with the exception of the ''supreme paradise''.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Glassé, Huston Smith ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'' Rowman Altamira 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-759-10190-6}} page 144&lt;/ref&gt; This realm is thus eternal existence, while the others are created and limited.&lt;ref&gt;N. Hanif ''Biographical Encyclopaedia of Sufis: Central Asia and Middle East'' Sarup &amp; Sons 2002 {{ISBN|978-8-176-25266-9}} page 306&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anthrozoology''' (also known as '''human–non-human-animal studies''', or''' HAS''') is the subset of [[ethnobiology]] that deals with interactions between humans and other animals. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that overlaps with other disciplines including [[anthropology]], [[ethnology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]]. A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Daniel S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrueZDfPUzoC&amp;pg=PA28 "Anthrozoology"], ''The Encyclopedia of Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare''. CABI 2010, pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes scholars from fields such as anthropology, sociology, biology, history and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, Margo. ''Teaching the Animal: Human–Animal Studies Across the Disciplines''. Lantern Books, 2010, p. xi. and Hurn, Samantha. ''Humans and Other Animals''. Pluto Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalsandsociety.org/content/index.php?pid=41 Animals &amp; Society Institute.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625044717/http://www.animalsandsociety.org/content/index.php?pid=41 |date=June 25, 2013 }} Accessed February 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: the term should not be confused with "animal studies," which often refers to [[animal testing]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthrozoology scholars, such as [[Pauleen Bennett]] recognize the lack of scholarly attention given to non-human animals in the past, and to the relationships between human and non-human animals, especially in the light of the magnitude of animal representations, symbols, stories and their actual physical presence in human societies. Rather than a unified approach, the field currently consists of several methods adapted from the several participating disciplines to encompass human-nonhuman animal relationships and occasional efforts to develop ''[[sui generis]]'' methods.

* The human-animal bond
* Parallels between human-animal interactions and human-technology interactions
* The symbolism of animals in literature and art
* The history of animal [[domestication]]
* The intersections of [[speciesism]], racism, and sexism
* The place of animals in human-occupied spaces
* The religious significance of animals throughout human history
* Exploring the cross-cultural [[cruelty to animals|ethical treatment of animals]]
* The critical evaluation of [[animal abuse]] and exploitation
* Mind, self, and [[Personhood#Non-human animals|personhood in nonhuman animals]]
* The potential human health benefits of companion animal ownership

== Growth of the field ==
There are currently 23 college programs in HAS or a related field in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Germany, Israel and the Netherlands, as well as an additional eight veterinary school programs in North America, and over thirty HAS organizations in the US, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Israel, Sweden, and Switzerland.

In the UK, the University of Exeter runs an MA in Anthrozoology which explores human-animal interactions from anthropological (cross-cultural) perspectives. Human animal interactions (HAI) involving companion animals are also studied by the [[Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition]], which partners with the US [[National Institutes of Health]] to research HAI in relation to child development and aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Processes in Social &amp; Affective Development: Human-Animal Interaction (HAI) Research|url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/der/branches/cdbb/programs/psad/HAI|website=Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)|accessdate=7 April 2018|date=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are now three primary lists for HAS scholars and students—H-Animal, the Human-Animal Studies listserv, and NILAS, as well as the Critical Animal Studies list.

There are now over a dozen journals covering HAS issues, many of them founded in the last decade, and hundreds of HAS books, most of them published in the last decade (see for example, ''Humanimalia''). Brill, Berg, Johns Hopkins, Purdue, Columbia, Reaktion, Palgrave-McMillan, University of Minnesota, University of Illinois, and Oxford all offer either a HAS series or a large number of HAS books.

In addition, in 2006, Animals and Society Institute (ASI) began hosting the Human-Animal Studies Fellowship, a six-week program in which pre- and post-doctoral scholars work on a HAS research project at a university under the guidance of host scholars and distance peer scholars. Beginning in 2011, ASI has partnered with Wesleyan Animal Studies, who will be hosting the fellowship in conjunction with ASI. There are also a handful of HAS conferences per year, including those organized by ISAZ and NILAS, and the Minding Animals conference, held in 2009 in Australia. Finally, there are more HAS courses being taught now than ever before. The ASI website lists over 300 courses (primarily in North America, but also including Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, and Poland) in twenty-nine disciplines at over 200 colleges and universities, not including over 100 law school courses.

'''Arasbaran''' ({{lang-fa|ارسباران}} ''Arasbârân'') or '''Arasbar''' ({{lang-fa|ارسبار}} ''Arasbâr''), also known as "'''Qaradagh'''" or "'''Karadagh'''" ({{lang-az|Qaradağ}} / {{lang|az-Arab|قره‌داغ}}, meaning "black mountain"), or "'''Qaraja dagh'''" or "'''Karaja dagh'''" ({{lang-az|Qaracadağ}} / {{lang|az-Arab|قراجه‌‌داغ}}, meaning "black mountain"), is a large mountainous area stretching from the Qūshā Dāgh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qūshā Dāgh|url=http://travelingluck.com/Asia/Iran/(IR24)/_41792_Q%C5%ABsh%C4%81+D%C4%81gh.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; massif, south of [[Ahar]], to the [[Aras River]] in [[East Azerbaijan Province]] of [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Oberling, Pierre. "The Tribes of Qarāca Dāġ: A Brief History." Oriens 17 (1964): p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The region is  confined to [[Aras River]] in the north, [[Meshgin Shahr County]] and Moghan in the east, [[Sarab County]] in the south, and [[Tabriz County|Tabriz]] and [[Marand County|Marand]] counties in the west. Since 1976, [[UNESCO]] has registered 72,460 hectares of the region, confined to 38°40' to 39°08'N and 46°39' to 47°02'E, as [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves|biosphere reserve]] with the following general description:
{{quote|This biosphere reserve situated in the north of Iran at the border to [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] belongs to the Caucasus Iranian Highlands. In-between the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]], [[Caucasus]] and [[Mediterranean region]], the area covers mountains up to 2,200 metres, high alpine meadows, semi-arid steppes, rangelands and forests, rivers and springs. Arasbaran is the territory of about 23,500 nomads who are mainly living in the buffer and transition zones (2000). Economic activities in the biosphere reserve are mainly agriculture, animal husbandry, horticulture, apiculture, handicrafts and tourism, but business activities can also be found in urbanized areas.''&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Summary|url=http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=IRA+01&amp;mode=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
There is no mention of Arasbaran as a geo-political entity in written sources dating prior to [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qaradagh's formation in Safavid era |url=http://www.mirjalalmousavi.ir/?p=1293 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406215855/http://www.mirjalalmousavi.ir/?p=1293 |archivedate=2014-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a speculation that the region referred to as '''Syah Kuh''' by the 10th-century [[Muslim]]  geographer, [[Ibn Hawqal]],&lt;ref&gt;Abu-'l-Qāsim Ibn-ʻAlī Ibn-Ḥauqal, The Oriental Geography of Ebn Haukal, an Arabian Traveller of the Tenth Century, London, 1800 pp.184-185.&lt;/ref&gt; corresponds to the present day Arasbaran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photos of Kaleybar|url=http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/272674/%D9%86%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D8%B2%DB%8C%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%B7%D8%A8%DB%8C%D8%B9%D8%AA-%DA%A9%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%A8%D8%B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fekrdar|first=Sahar|title=Reporing from Arasbaran Paradise|url=http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13930101001190}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the said Syahkoh has more similarities with Manghishlaq in the eastern shores of [[Caspian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Alan Brook, The Jews of Khazaria, 2006, Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, pp. 152-153&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Arasbaran's history should be considered in the context of its two main towns, [[Ahar]] and [[Kaleybar]].

[[Kaleybar]], formerly known as '''bedh''',  was the stronghold of [[Babak Khorramdin]] who, in 816 AD, revolted against Islamic [[Caliphate]] and was  defeated in 836 AD.&lt;ref&gt;K. Farrokh, Iran at War: 1500-1988, 2011, Osprey Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The events of the two decades long tumultuous times have been extensively reported by Islamic historians of the epoch. The first report is by [[Al-Masudi]] in [[The Meadows of Gold]]: ''Babak revolted in '''Bedh''' region with the disciples of Djavidan'' ...&lt;ref&gt;‘Alī ibn al-Husayn al- Mas‘Ūdī, Pavet de Courteille, Les Prairies d'or de Maçoudi, 1873, Paris, vol. 7, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; ''Following a series of defeats Babak was blockaded in his native town..., which even now is known as Babak's countr''y.&lt;ref&gt;‘Alī ibn al-Husayn al- Mas‘Ūdī, Pavet de Courteille, Les Prairies d'or de Maçoudi, 1873, Paris, vol. 7, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Athir]] in his book, [[The Complete History]], has devoted many pages to the description of battles.&lt;ref&gt;عز الدین ابن اثیر، تاریخ کامل، ۱۳۸۱، تهران، جلد نهم، صص‌. ۳۹۸۲-۴۰۱۲.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], writing in early thirteenth century, describes [[Kaleybar]]  in the following words,  ''County between Azerbaijan and Erran.... This county produces pomegranates  of incomparable beauty, excellent figs and grapes that are dried on fires (because the sun is always obscured by thick clouds).''&lt;ref&gt;Yaqut ibn 'Abd Allah al-Rumi al-Hamawi, Charles Adrien Casimir Barbier de Meynard, Dictionnaire géographique, historique et littéraire de la Perse et des contrees adjacentes,  1851, Paris, pp. 87-88&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th-13th centuries, [[Ahar]] was a minor and short-lived, but prosperous [[emirate]] ruled by the [[Pishteginid dynasty]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] origin (1155—1231).&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Minorsky|Minorsky, Vladimir]] (1951), "The Georgian Maliks of Ahar."

Both towns lost most of their importance during the rule of [[Ilkhanate]]. [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]], writing in the-mid fourteenth century, describes [[Ahar]] as "a little town",&lt;ref&gt;نزهةالقلوب ، حمداله مستوفی ، به کوشش محمد دبیر سیاقی ، انتشارات کتابخانه طهوری ، چاپ اول ، تهران ، ۱۳۳۶، ص. ۹۵.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kaleybar]] as "A village of Azerbaijan, in the woods near a mountain which comprises a fortress".&lt;ref&gt;Yaqut ibn 'Abd Allah al-Rumi al-Hamawi, Charles Adrien Casimir Barbier de Meynard, Dictionnaire géographique, historique et littéraire de la Perse et des contrees adjacentes,  1851, Paris, p. 493&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;نزهةالقلوب ، حمداله مستوفی ، به کوشش محمد دبیر سیاقی ، انتشارات کتابخانه طهوری ، چاپ اول ، تهران ، ۱۳۳۶، ص. ۹۶.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ahar]] was in the focus of [[Safavid dynasty]]'s agenda for casting of [[Azerbaijan]] as a [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] dominion. Thus, [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]] rebuilt the mausoleum of Sheikh Sheikh Shihab-al-din in Ahar.&lt;ref&gt;Kishwar Rizvi , The Safavid Dynastic Shrine: Architecture, Religion and Power in Early ..., 2011, I.B.Tauris, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; In 1604, as Ottoman forces threatened the area directly to the north of Arasbaran during the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1603-1618)]], Shah Abbas ordered [[Maqsud Sultan Kangarlu|Maqsud Sultan]] to evacuate the entire population of the [[Nakhchivan khanate|Nakhichevan]] region (including the [[Armenians]] of Jolfa, who, in the following year, were transplanted to [[Isfahan]]) to Arasbaran and Dezmar.&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;{{cite web

Arasbaran region suffered enormously during [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)]] and [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)]] due to its proximity to the war zone. Western travellers in 1837-1843 period had found [[Ahar]], a city with around 700 households, in wretched condition.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tappe, Frontier Nomads of Iran: A Political and Social History of the Shahsevan, 1997, Cambridge University Press, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Arasbaran was one of the epicentres of [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]]. [[Tribes of Arasbaran|Arasbaran tribes]] were heavily involved in armed conflicts; the revolutionary and anti-revolutionary camps were headed, respectively, by [[Sattar Khan]] and [[Rahimkhan Chalabianloo]], both from '''Qaradağ''' region. When in 1925 [[Rezā Shāh]] deposed [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]] and founded the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], Arasbaran's gradual decline started. The new king insisting on cultural and [[Iranian peoples|ethnic]] [[Iranian nationalism|nationalism]], and implemented a policy of cultural assimilation.&lt;ref name="Abrahamian 1982 123–163"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abrahamian|first=Ervand|authorlink=Ervand Abrahamian|title=Iran Between Two Revolutions|year=1982|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=123–163|isbn=9780691053424|oclc=7975938}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He renamed Qaradağ as Arasbaran to deny the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] identity of the inhabitants. Consequently, Arasbaran is no longer in the focus of national politics. Still, many books and articles are being written on the contribution of Arasbaran region, and its inhabitants in the contemporary history of Iran cannot be underestimated.

==Arasbaran ecotourism potential==
The declaration by [[UNESCO]] of Arasbaran as a [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves|UNESCO Biosphere]] reserve in 1976 &lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt; was a great endorsement for the region's [[ecotourism]] potential. More recently, visitors from places as far away as [[Canada]] have expressed their amazement with approving words.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Maslin, "Iranian Rappers and Persian Porn: A Hitchhiker's Adventures in the New Iran", 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The planned promotion of the [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves|Biosphere]] to the [[National Park]] status may farther enhance Arasbaran's environmental significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arasbaran; the twenteith National Park|url=http://hamshahrionline.ir/details/22372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arasbaran is home to 215 species of birds, notably the [[Caucasian grouse|Caucasian black grouse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Habibzadeh, Nader |author2=Karami, Mahmoud |author3=Alavipanah, Sied K. |author4=Riazi, Borhane |year=2013|title=Landscape requirements of Caucasian Grouse (''Lyrurus mlokosiewiczi'') in Arasbaran Region, East Azerbaijan, Iran|journal=The Wilson Journal of Ornithology|volume=125|issue=1|pages=140&amp;ndash;149|doi=10.1676/09-169.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[grey partridge]], [[black francolin]], and [[common pheasant]], 29 species of reptiles, 48 species of mammals, notably [[wild goat]], [[wild boar]], [[brown bear]], [[wolf]], [[lynx]], and [[leopard]], and 17 species of fish. There is an effort going on to revitalise&lt;sup&gt;(??)&lt;/sup&gt; the extinct sub-species of [[Caspian red deer]] local to the area &lt;sup&gt;(If extinct then how can it be "revitalised"?)&lt;/sup&gt;. The local flora include [[hornbeam]], [[sumac]], and ''[[Berberis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Asef, M.R. (2007) Macrofungi flora of Arasbaran 1. Cortinarius subgenus Myxacium. Rostaniha 8(2) 178–185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asef, M.R. (2012), Lepiotaceous fungi (Agaricaceae) in the Iranian part of Caucasia, Turkish Journal of Botany. 36: 289–294. doi:10.3906/bot-1006-10&lt;/ref&gt; A unique characteristic of Arasbaran forests is the ubiquity of edible wild trees. For instance, a patch of forest between [[Aghaweye]] and [[Oskolou]] includes hazelnut trees. The large walnut and ''[[Cornus mas]]'' trees, which grow wild alongside streams, provide an important income source for inhabitants. More exotic plant species, such as [[redcurrant]], [[truffle]] and herbs with application in [[traditional medicine]] significantly add to the ecological importance of Arasbaran region.

A recent study has indicated that three sites have the highest potential for ecotourism. These sites, which are located  alongside the road connecting [[Kaleybar]] to [[Asheqlu]] ([[Abbasabad, Khoda Afarin|Abbasabad]]-[[Aynaloo]]-[[Vayqan-e Maqadas|Vayqan]] direction), include [[Mikandi]] valley, Aynali forests and [[Babak Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Neda Mohseni, Shahram Roostaei, Arasbaran ecotourism potential assessment with emphasis on the scientific and additional values, International Research Journal of Applied and Basic Sciences. (2012) 3:1143–1147&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, more unexplored tourist potentials. One example is a holy mountain located at the coordinate (38°55'16.64"N,46°47'24.62"E). Most inhabitants of the now abandoned village, [[Garmanab]], were Izadis, the followers [[Yârsânism|Yârsân]] religion. They used to slaughter sacrificial animals in the site, which is located at the slopes of a hill. Nobody bothered to ask the reasons behind the holiness of the site.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} However, the pleasures of an occasional feast was so tempting that the followers of the Shia' sect attended the holy site, too. Nowadays there are few worshipers and the centuries long traditions are almost forgotten. The revival of these rituals may attract cultural visitors.

Another potential tourist attraction are the summer camps ([[w:fa:ییلاق|ییلاق]]) of semi-settled [[Tribes of Arasbaran]], known as Ilat, who spend five months of the year in uplands for grazing their livestock. A tourist, while enjoying the fresh thin air of the mountains, may get a chance to observe the age-long traditional living styles of the locals. Some of the attractive sites are [[Aliabad, Kaleybar|Aliabad]] mountains, meadows above [[Shojaabad, East Azerbaijan]] village, and [[Chaparli]] and [[Agdash Abbasabad|Aqdash]] summer quarters, all located in a driving distance from [[Kaleybar]].

Numerous [[hot spring]]s, scattered all over the region, have been considered as attractions for promoting tourism. One example is [[Motaalleq]] hot spring therapeutic facility, which is the largest of its kind in Iran. The facility, with an area of 12870 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; includes bathing areas, coffee-shop, restaurants, prayer room, and gymnasium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The largest water therapy facility of Iran|url=http://www.donya-e-eqtesad.com/news/739258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the local government has organised [[Cornus mas|Zoğal]] festivals in [[Kaleybar]] as a means of promoting tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornus mass Festival|url=http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13920621000144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, every year, in the second half of October, a [[Pomegranate]] Festival is organised in  by the provincial authorities in [[Mardanaqom]] village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The first pomegranate festival|url=http://www.magiran.com/npview.asp?ID=1974970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The first pomegranate festival in Mardanaqom|url=http://tabriztourist.ir/index.php/k2/festival/432-2013-12-24-07-43-56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main programme of the festival is the performance of [[Ashik|ashugh]] music.

Nearly every village in the region has a landmark in its territories. Some of these are potential tourism attractions. For instance, there is a landmark ancient plane tree in the [[Kavanaq]] village, whose photo is presented here. The tree is about 3 metres in diameter and is said to have lived for 500 years. The villagers have developed interesting oral narratives around the events experienced by the tree.

==Demography==
'''{{Main|Tribes of Arasbaran|Qaradaghis}}'''
In the wake of [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)]] a significant fraction of the inhabitants lived as nomadic tribes. The major tribes included; [[Chalabianlu]] 1500 tents and houses, Karacurlu 2500, [[Haji-Alilu]] 800, Begdillu 200, and various minor groups 500.&lt;ref&gt;R. Khanam, Encycl. Ethnography Of Middle-East And Central Asia, 2005, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; At the time [[Ahar]], with 3500 inhabitants, was the only city of Qaradağ.&lt;ref&gt;Bibliothèque orientale Elzévirienne, Volume 52; Volume 55, 1887 p.224.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the beginning of the twentieth century the settlement of tribesman were growing and in 1920 there were more than four hundred villages, less than thirty of which were [[Armenians|Armenian]].&lt;ref&gt;Report on India and Persia of the deputation: sent by the Board of foreign missions of the Presbyterian church in the U.S.A. to visit these fields in 1921–22, p. 513&lt;/ref&gt; However, the nomadic way of living has survived to the present. The nomadic population at present has been estimated to be about 36000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tahmasebi|first1=Asghar|title=Pastoral Vulnerability to Socio-Political and Climate Stresses|date=2013|publisher=LIT Verlag GmbH|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is not significantly different from the 30000 estimate of 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bainbridge|first1=M.|title=Turkic Peoples Of The World|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Canada|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of [[Azerbaijani Democratic Party|Azerbaijan People's Government]] and the following events, resulted in mass migration of inhabitants to [[Tabriz]] and [[Tehran]]. Most of these migrants settled in the shanty towns and worked as painters. The land reforms of 1962–1964&lt;ref&gt;William Bayne Fisher (editor), The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 1, 1968 p.684&lt;/ref&gt; accelerated the migration. The case of a typical village, [[Abbasabad, Khoda Afarin|Abbasabad]], is a good example to demonstrate the population depletion; the number of families dropped from 60 families at 1970 to 12 at 2006.

After the election of [[Ahmadinezhad]] as president of Iran, a rumour was circulated that UNESCO will compensate the residents to have the village evacuated for wild-life protection efforts.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Some early emigrants returned and built decent houses. At the present the region is undergoing a population boom as more wealthy city residents want to spend their retirement in a cleaner environment. Recently, the deputy governor of the [[East Azarbaijan]] province has mentioned the phenomenon of reverse migration to [[Khoda Afarin County|Khoda Afarin]] and [[Kaleybar County|Kaleybar]] counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reverse migration in Khoda Afarin and Kaleybar Countie|url=http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13930209000905|website=Fars News Agency|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is that the population is aging and the working class adults, in the face of scarce job opportunities, live most of the year in large population centres such as Tehran. The issue is so critical that during recent presidential campaign, [[Mohsen Rezaee]] referred to Iranian villages as the ''old age residence''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13920314000317&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
The spoken language is [[Azerbaijani Turkish|Azerbaijani]]. It has a high degree of intelligibility with Anatolian Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World, 2010, Elsevier, p. 110-113&lt;/ref&gt; Most inhabitants are familiar with Persian language, which is the official language of Iran and the sole language of education. Until 1980, the elders of four villages (Chay Kandi, Kalasor, Khoynarood, and Arazin) were communicating in Tati,&lt;ref&gt;James Stuart Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas Charles Pappas (Editors), An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires  1994, p. 623&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Yarshater, Iranian Languages and Texts from Iran and Turan,  edited by Maria Macuch, Mauro Maggi, Werner Sundermann, 2007, page 443.&lt;/ref&gt; a language which was the Iranian language of Azerbaijan before the  arrival of speakers of Turkish in the time of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (around 1000 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iranica: Azeri|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/azerbaijan-vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural heritage==
The [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] era was a dark period for cultural identity of Arasbaran. [[Rezā Shāh]],  insisting on [[Iranian peoples|ethnic]] [[Iranian nationalism|nationalism]] and cultural unitarism,  implemented his policies of forced detribalisation and [[sedentarisation]].&lt;ref name="Abrahamian 1982 123–163"/&gt; He renamed Qaradağ as Arasbaran to deny the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] identity of the inhabitants. Moreover, the education and publication in [[Azerbaijani Turkish language]] was banned and  writers of Azerbaijan had to write in [[Persian language|Persian]], a medium which was, perhaps, not adequate for recording the subtleties of Qaradağ's native culture that has evolved under influence of [[Turkish language]]. This language, has a rare and unusual point of grammar called the ''hearsay tense''.&lt;ref&gt;Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul: Memories and the City, Random house (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in Turkish speaking society the boundary between the private and shared memories becomes fuzzy, and the magnitude of time lapse between the events shrinks. This is an ideal feature for the generation of oral cultural artifacts, particularly mythology, epics and folkloric music.

A rare opportunity for recording and preserving  Qaradağ's culture was provided by the innovative method by which [[Mohammad-Hossein Shahriar|Shahriar]] in his famous  verse book, ''[[Heydar Babaya Salam]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hail to Haydar Baba|url=http://www.umich.edu/~turkish/links/manuscripts/haydarbaba/haydarbaba.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted  to summarize the [[Cultural identity]] in concise poetic form.  A generation of lesser known poets from Arasbaran used similar approach  for perpetuating region's oral traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=دوستی|first=حسین|title=همصدایی با شهریار|date=12 آذر، 1392|publisher=یاران}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Remarkable examples are ''mourning [[Sabalan]]'' by Abbas Barez,&lt;ref name="اسلامی"&gt;{{cite book|last=اسلامی|first=عباس|title=یاسلی ساوالان|date=۱۳۷۹-۱۰-۰۵|location=تبریز|url=http://vista.ir/article/598286}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Hail to Qizil Qala'h" by Seifollah Delkhon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=دلخون|first=سیف الله|title=قیزیل قیه یه سلام|date=20 دی، 1388|publisher=مهد آزادی}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is  Mohamad Golmohamadi's long  poem, titled ''I am madly in love with Qareh Dagh'' (قاراداغ اؤلکه‌سینین گؤر نئجه دیوانه‌سی ام), which is a concise description of the region's cultural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I am madly in love with Qareh Dagh |url=http://www.mirjalalmousavi.ir/?p=1828 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329005421/http://www.mirjalalmousavi.ir/?p=1828 |archivedate=2014-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythology===

The inhabitants of every village attribute spiritual importance to at multiple sites, scattered throughout the village territory. These places, generally known as [[w:az:Ocaq iyesi|Ojaq]], are  located in areas with rapid variation on the land topography, and are in some way linked to Djins via established narratives. Most of these sites possess any significantly conspicuous landmark. At some sites, which are considered sacred by many villages, people will occasionally gather to slaughter sacrificial animals or  offer a simple meal of freshly baked bread and cheese with tea. At some sites, they have collected medium-sized rocks around some trees and hang coloured threads or ribbons from the trees.

In most villages, there are sites with narrative associations, which are not considered sacred. These sites are in secluded locations formed by natural topography of the landscape. Often the narratives involve bears as the principal subject. The main theme of the narratives is the following. A male bear kidnaps a blackberry picking pretty girl and takes her to his den. A hybrid child is born, but the girl runs away at the first opportunity leaving the lamenting bear entreatingly crying for his lost wife.

According to a myth the wolf is found as a symbol of merciless power that is able to destroy everything. If a human being touches it, whatever frightens him/her will be frustrated.&lt;ref&gt;Rafifar, Jalal. "Some indications of shamanism in Arasbaran rock carvings." Documenta Praehistorica 34 (2007): 203-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vergi====
Vergi, meaning gift, is a perceived ability for  performing extraordinary feats such as prophesy or healing, which supposedly can only be received from god or from [[Shia Islam|Shia']]  [[Imam]]s.&lt;ref name=Vergi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rohozinski|first=J. E. R. Z. Y.|title=Healing and Foretelling Practices in Azerbaijan.|journal=ISIM Newsletter|year=2003|volume=12|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that a Vergi is inherited and not to be learned. For instance, there is a family in [[Vayqan-e Maqadas|Vayqan]] among whom  the Vergi for catching snakes is transmitted from generation to generation. Sometimes, the Vergi is claimed to be received in dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Basilov|first=V. N.|title=Blessing in a Dream|journal=Turcica|year=1995|volume=27|pages=237–46|doi=10.2143/turc.27.0.2004364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baṣgöz|first=Ilhan|title=Dream Motif in Turkish Folk Stories and Shamanistic Initiation|journal=Asian Folklore Studies|year=1967|volume=26|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.2307/1177696}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But often, it is received in [[w:az:Ocaq iyesi|Ojaqs]] where ghosts show themselves to and talk to gifted. It is believed that there is no escape from Vergi and that, at first, it generates suffering comparable to [[Shamanism|shamanistic]] illness.&lt;ref name="Vergi" /&gt;

====Toğs; relics of Ashura day?====
Ashura, the 10th day of the lunar month Muharram, is the day at which the mourning celebrations commemorating Imam Husayns' martyrdom reach their climax.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhol Loefler, Islam in Practice: Religious Beliefs in a Persian Village, State University of New York Press, 1988, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; In many villages of Qaradağ, palm sized metallic icons fixed on a medium-sized wooden handles, locally known as Toğs, are harbingers of the exact hour when Husayn was killed; allegedly, they relapse to utter in-animation following ten days of relentless erratic movements at the hands of their carriers (alamdars). The tuğs – believed to be sisters – are housed in the mosques  and are greatly revered by the inhabitants of all neighbouring villages. Unfortunately, there are no systematic studies or first hand reports on these fascinating relics. Still, every year, as a ritualistic obligation, expatriates flock to the said villages to receive the blessings of the sacred day in the company of their sacred Toğs.  In the accompanying photo two persons holding toğ can be seen, who are surrounded by mourners beating on their legs. One toğ is kept standing still in the centre. It seems that the other toğ is performing erratic motions and is pulling the holder.

===Arasbaran dogs===

[[Orhan Pamuk]] in 2001 [[Turkey|Turkish]] novel, ''[[My Name Is Red]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Orhan Pamuk,My Name Is Red, 2006,  Random House LLC., Chap. 3&lt;/ref&gt; gives a vivid description of Turkic people's love-hate attitude towards dogs. Every summer, the real life version of this description is in display in Chaparli. Each family has 2-5 dogs, all with characteristic cropped ears and tails. The dogs are fed generous portions of milk soaked bread. When the sheep herds are brought back for milking near tents, dogs sleep around the camp most of the day. The inhabitants treat the beasts with utter respect, a manner which is loathed by more pious villagers of the region as a pagan act. Between dusk and down dogs regain their vicious character; strangers have to avoid crossing a campsite otherwise the attacking dogs cannot be controlled even by their owners. Fending off the dogs by beating is considered an act of aggression towards the owner and should be avoided. In fact most of the feuds between settled villagers and pastoralists are about dogs.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Arasbaran carpet===
[[Carpet]] weaving stands out as the acme of Azeri art and people of Arasbaran have significantly contributed to this artistic tradition. Arabaran carpet was a hybrid between [[Persian carpet]] and [[Azerbaijani rug]]. There were indigenous styles as well. For instance, carpets known as [[Balan, Kaleybar|Balan]] rugs had a size of approximately 1x4 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a characteristic pattern.

The acme of carpet weaving art in Arasbaran is manifested in [[Azerbaijani rug|verni]],&lt;ref&gt;K K Goswam, Advances in Carpet Manufacture, 2008, Woodhead Publishing in Textiles, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taqipour|first=Reza|title=An introduction to verni|url=http://www.aharri.com/?p=1684}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was originated in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. Verni is a carpet-like [[kilim]] with a delicate and fine warp and weft, which is woven without a previous sketch, thanks to the creative talents of nomadic women and girls.

===Ashughi music and Qaradağ's contribution===
{{main|Ashik}}
&lt;poem&gt;
''Bəlkə bu yerlərə birdə gəlmədim'' (I may not come to these mountains again)
''duman səlamət qal dağ səlamət qal'' (Farewell to the Mist and to the mountain)
''arxamca su səpir göydə bulutlar'' (Clouds sprinkle drops of rain)
''leysan səlamət qal yağ səlamət'' qal (Farewell to summer days, farewell to the rain)
&lt;/poem&gt;
These opening verses of a contemporary [[ashug]] song, composed by Məhəmməd Araz,&lt;ref&gt;محمد آراز، بلكه بويئرلره بيرده گلمه‌ديم ، ۱۳۸۹، تبریز، نشر اختر&lt;/ref&gt;  may well represent the essence of Qaradağ's cultural identity; frequent allusions to a mountain with the intention of arousing an emotional state with a tone of mild melancholy- a state well expressed by the [[ashugh]]i music.

A century long autocratic nation building policies of [[Pahlavi era]]  in Iran has succeeded in cultural assimilation in the favor of a government sanctioned culture. The mountainous region of Qaradağ, however, relatively escaped the demise due to its remoteness and inaccessibility. Many elements of the indigenous culture, particularly local music, have survived to the present day.  More recently a slow but persistent cultural revival has been in progress and the inhabitants along with their city dwelling relatives perceive an awareness of their common cultural roots with the inhabitants of eastern Turkey and Azerbaijan republics,where a cultural renaissance is well underway since the collapse of the Soviet Union.  The [[ashugh]]i music is cornerstone of this shared identity.

The number of ashughs has significantly increased after Aşiq Imran Heydəri (عاشیق ایمران حیدری) started accepting pupils to his academic style classes in [[Tabriz]]. Imran's efforts effectively shifted the general impression of the ashugh music from association to the nomadic life in mountains to a music suited for  performances in urban settings. At present, the de facto representative of ashughs is Aşiq Rəsol Qorbani from [[Abbasabad, Khoda Afarin|Abbasabad]] village.

==Economy==
Up until the Islamic revolution the region had a subsistence economy – all food was produced within the villages and the surplus was bartered with items supplied by travelling salesman. Most women spent winter months weaving [[carpet]]s using raw material which were locally produced. Rainfed agriculture on the steep slopes had severely eroded the farms and productivity had dropped to an unsustainable low level, and the inhabitants had to supplement their income by taking seasonal construction jobs in Tehran.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} After the revolution, thanks to the construction of roads giving accessibility to larger town markets, livestock production became the dominant mode of the region's economy. However, the quarrels over grazing rights didn't allow large-scale animal agriculture.

In recent years [[beekeeping]] has emerged as the only occupation that can provide a family with sufficient income. The honey produced in villages close to pastures is renowned for the its quality and has an established niche market. [[Mardanaqom]] village is one of the main producers of honey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mardangoom.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517212143/http://mardangoom.com/ |archivedate=2014-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ciimnuai''' was the legendary city-state of [[Zomi]], who are mostly referred to as [[Chin people|Chins]] in [[Myanmar]], [[Mizo people|Mizo]], [[Kukish languages|Kuki]] or even as [[Paite people|Paite]] in [[India]], and [[Bawmzo]] in [[Bangladesh]]. Being their birthplace, Ciimnuai bears many accounts of myths and legends of Zomi. Carey and Tuck even called the city "Eden of the Chins".&lt;ref&gt;Bertram S. Carey &amp; Henry N. Tuck, ''The Chins: a history of the people, our dealings with them, their customs and manners, and a gazetteer of their country'', vol. 1 (Rangoon, Burma: Government Printing, 1896), 127 [Carey records it as Chin Nwe, probably be the mispronunciation of his Burman guide].&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to tradition, it is located about two and half miles southwest from present [[Tedim]] and is in the precinct of present [[Saizang]] village. Traditions ascribe the founding of the city to [[Guite people|Guite]] family, the then ruling house.&lt;ref&gt;Surajit Sinha, ''Tribal Polities and State Systems in Pre-Colonial Eastern and North Eastern India'' (Culcutta, India: Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, K .P. Bagchi &amp; Co., 1987), 312 [Sinha also refers to Ciimnuai (Chiimnuai/Chiimnwe/Chinwe) as the first Guite/Vuite village]. Because of long cheiftainship of the Guite as such, Goswami explains that the Paite even more prefer to be identified as Guite than as the Paite [cf., M. C. Goswami &amp; H. Kamkhenthang, ‘Clan Among the Paite,’ in ''Bulletin of the Department of Anthropology'', Vol. IV (Guahati University, 1975): 22].&lt;/ref&gt; Some of its remainings can still be collected at the site. However, some contemporary local historians contend that this current site might not be the only Ciimnuai that bears such numerous myths and stories, proposing that there might still be other ''Ciimnuai''s outside of present Chin Hills.&lt;ref&gt;Sing Khaw Khai, ''Zo People and Their Culture: a historical, cultural study and critical analysis of Zo and its ethnic tribes'' (New Lamka, Manipur: Khampu Hatzaw, 1995), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; If it is the case, the Ciimnuai at this current site must be a later Ciimnuai that adopted the name of the former. Moreover, even at the present site, several oral histories and traditions indicate that there are at least two different encampments (or settlements) occurred there and there’re at least four generations gone in between. Some of those commemorative songs and poetic sayings are as follow. 

Concerning the first settlement:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16170">'''Collocation''' is a procedure used in [[remote sensing]] 
to match measurements from two or more different instruments.
This is done for two main reasons: 
for validation purposes when comparing measurements of the same variable, 
and to relate measurements of two different variables 
either for performing retrievals or for prediction.
In the second case the data is later fed into some type of statistical 
[[inverse problem|inverse method]]
such as an [[artificial neural network]], [[statistical classification]] algorithm, 
[[kernel estimation|kernel estimator]] or a [[Linear least squares (mathematics)|linear least squares]]. 
In principle, most collocation problems can be solved by a [[nearest neighbor search]],
but in practice there are many other considerations involved and the best method is
highly specific to the particular matching of instruments.
Here we deal with some of the most important considerations along with specific examples.

There are at least two main considerations when performing collocations.
The first is the sampling pattern of the instrument.
Measurements may be dense and regular, such as those from a cross-track
scanning satellite instrument.  In this case, some form of [[interpolation]]
may be appropriate.  On the other hand, the measurements may be
sparse, such as a one-off field campaign designed for some
particular validation exercise.
The second consideration is the instrument footprint, which
can range from something approaching a point measurement
such as that of a [[radiosonde]], or it might be several
kilometers in diameter such as that of a satellite-mounted,
microwave radiometer.  In the latter case, it is appropriate
to take into account the instrument [[antenna pattern]] when
making comparisons with another instrument having both a smaller
footprint and a denser sampling, that is, several measurements
from the one instrument will fit into the footprint of the other.

Just as the instrument has a spatial footprint, it will also have
a temporal footprint, often called the integration time.
While the integration time is usually less than a second,
which for meteorological applications is essentially instantaneous,
there are many instances where some form of time averaging can considerably
ease the collocation process.

The collocations will need to be screened based on both the time
and length scales of the phenomenon of interest.
This will further facilitate the collocation process since 
remote sensing and other measurement data is almost always 
[[data binning|binned]] in some way.
Certain atmospheric phenomena such as clouds or convection are quite transient
so that we need not consider collocations with a time error of more than an hour or so.
Sea ice, on the other hand, moves and evolves quite slowly, so that
measurements separated by as much as a day or more might still be useful.

==Satellites==

[[Image:AMSUB scan tracks.png|thumb|center|upright=2.5|alt=AMSU-B flight tracks|Polar-stereographic projection showing 12 hours of measurements from three AMSU-B instruments]]

The [[satellite]]s that most concern us are those with a [[low Earth orbit|low-Earth]], [[polar orbit]] since [[geostationary]] satellites view the same point throughout their lifetime.
The diagram shows measurements from [[Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit|AMSU-B]]
instruments mounted on three satellites over a period of 12 hours.
This illustrates both the orbit path and the scan pattern which runs crosswise.
Since the [[orbit]] of a satellite is [[deterministic system|deterministic]], 
barring [[orbital maneuver|orbit maneuvers]], we can predict the location of the
satellite at a given time and, by extension, the location of
the measurement pixels.
In theory, collocations can be performed by inverting the
determining equations starting from the desired time period.
In practice, partially processed data (usually referred to as
level 1b, 1c or level 2) contain the coordinates of each of
the measurement pixels and  
it is common to simply feed these coordinates to a nearest neighbor search.
As mentioned previously, the satellite data is always [[Data binning|binned]]
in some manner.  
At minimum, the data will be arranged in 
swaths extending from pole to pole.
The swaths will be labelled by time period and the
approximate location known.

==Radiosondes==

[[Image:Rs ascent.gif|thumb|center|upright=2|alt=Ascent of a nominal weather balloon|Ascent of a weather balloon launched from the Polarstern research vessel]]

[[Radiosonde]]s are particularly important for collocation studies
because they measure atmospheric variables more accurately and more
directly than satellite or other remote-sensing instruments.
In addition, radiosonde samples are effectively instantaneous point measurements.
One issue with radiosondes carried aloft by [[weather balloon]]s is
balloon drift.  In,&lt;ref name="Buehler_etal2004"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
this is handled by averaging all the satellite pixels within a 50&amp;nbsp;km radius
of the balloon launch.

[[Image:Rs ascent hist.gif|thumb|right|upright=2|alt=Weather balloon ascent rate distribution|Histogram of ascent rates of weather balloons launch from the Polarstern research vessel]]

If high-resolution sonde data, which normally has a constant
sampling rate or includes the measurement time, is used,
then the lateral motion can be traced from the wind data.
Even with low-resolution data, the motion can still
be approximated by assuming a constant ascent rate.
Excepting a short bit towards the end, 
the linear ascent can be clearly seen in the figure above.
We can show that the ascent rate of a balloon is given
by the following equation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
v = \sqrt{\frac{g k h (1 - R_a/R_s)}{c_D}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is gravitational acceleration,
''k'' relates the height, ''h'', and surface area, ''A'',
of the balloon to its volume: ''V''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''khA''; 
''R''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the equivalent "gas constant" of the balloon, 
''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the gas constant of the air
and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is the drag coefficient of the balloon.
Substituting some sensible values for each of the constants,
''k''=1. (the balloon is a perfect cylinder), ''h''=2. m, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.
and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the gas constant of helium,
returns an ascent rate of 4.1&amp;nbsp;m/s.  Compare this with the
values shown in the histogram which compiles all of the
radiosonde launches from the [[Polarstern]] research vessel
over a period of eleven years between 1992 and 2003.

==Interpolation==

For gridded data such as [[data assimilation|assimilation]] or [[meteorological reanalysis|reanalysis]] data,
[[interpolation]] is likely the most appropriate method for performing any type of comparison.
A specific point in both physical position and time is easy to locate
within the grid and interpolation performed between the nearest neighbors.
[[Linear interpolation]] ([[bilinear interpolation|bilinear]], [[trilinear interpolation|trilinear]] etc.) is the most common, 
though cubic is used as well but is probably not worth the extra computational overhead.
If the variable of interest has a relatively smooth rate of change (temperature is a good example of this because it
has a diffusion mechanism, [[radiative transfer]], not available to other atmospheric variables), 
then interpolation can eliminate much of the error associated with collocation.

Interpolation may also be appropriate for many types of satellite instruments,
for instance a cross-track scanning instrument like [[Landsat]].

interpolated (although not for the purposes of collocation) using a slight variation
of trilinear interpolation.
Since measurements within a single scan track are laid out in an approximately rectangular
grid, bilinear interpolation can be performed.
By searching for the nearest overlapping scan track both forwards and backwards in time,
the spatial interpolates can then be interpolated in time. 
This technique works better with derived quantities rather than raw brightness temperatures since
the scan angle will already have been accounted for.

For instruments with a more irregular sampling pattern, such as the [[Aqua (satellite)|Advanced Microwave
Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E)]] instrument which has a circular scanning pattern,
we need a more general form of interpolation such as [[kernel estimation]].
A method commonly used for this particular instrument, as well as [[SSM/I]],
is a simple daily average within regularly gridded, spatial bins

==Trajectories==

To collocate measurements of a medium- to long-lived [[flow tracer|atmospheric tracer]] with a second instrument, running [[trajectory (meteorology)|trajectories]] can considerably improve the accuracy.  It also simplifies the analysis somewhat: a trajectory is run both forwards and backwards from the measurement location and between the desired time window.  Note that the acceptable time window has now become longer because the error from transport induced changes in the tracer is removed: the tracer lifetime would be a good window to use.  Since the trajectories provide a location for every point in time within the time window, there is no need to check multiple measurements from the second instrument.  Every time within the trajectory is checked for the distance criterion but within a very narrow window.  Alternatively, the exact times of the measurements for the second instrument are interpolated within the trajectory.  Only the smallest distance error below the threshold is used and the distance criterion can be made smaller as a consequence.

==Example: Pol-Ice Campaign==

[[Image:EM-bird flights.png|thumb|center|upright=2|alt=Pol-Ice E-M bird flights|Map of E-M Bird flights from Pol-Ice campaign along with coincident EMIRAD flights]]

Collocations of sea ice thickness and [[brightness temperature]]s taken during the
[[Pol-Ice Campaign]] are an excellent example since they illustrate many of the most important principles as well as demonstrating the necessity of taking into account the individual case.  The Pol-Ice campaign was conducted in the N. Baltic in March 2007 as part of the SMOS-Ice project in preparation for the launch of the [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite]].  
Because of the low frequency of the SMOS instrument, it is hoped that it will render
information on sea ice thickness, therefore the campaign comprised measurements
of both sea ice thickness and emitted brightness temperature.
Brightness temperatures were measured with the EMIRAD L-band microwave radiometer

carried on board an airplane. Ice thickness was measured with the E-M Bird ice thickness meter which was carried by a helicopter.  The E-M Bird measures ice thickness with a combination of inductance measurements to determine the location of the ice-water interface and a [[LIDAR|laser altimeter]] to measure the height of the ice surface.&lt;ref name="Heygster_etal2009"&gt;

The map above shows the flight tracks of both instruments which were approximately coincident but obviously subject to pilot error.

[[Image:EMIRAD pattern.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.5|alt=EMIRAD antenna response pattern|EMIRAD antenna response pattern]]

Since the flight paths of both aircraft were approximately linear, the first step in the collocation process was to convert all the coincident flights to Cartesian coordinates with the ''x''-axis being lateral distance and the ''y''-axis transverse distance.  In this way, collocations can be performed in two ways: crudely, by matching only the ''x'' distances, and more precisely by matching both coordinates.

More importantly, the footprint size of the radiometer is many times larger
than that of the E-M Bird meter.  The figure to the left shows
the [[radiation pattern|antenna response function]] for the radiometer.
The [[full width at half maximum]] is 31 degrees.&lt;ref name="Skou_etal2007"/&gt;
Since the aircraft was flying at approximately 500 m, this translates
to a footprint size of 200 m or more.
Meanwhile, the footprint size of the E-M Bird was roughly 40 m
with a sample spacing of only 2 to 4 m.&lt;ref name="Heygster_etal2009"/&gt;
Rather than looking to nearest neighbors, which would have produced
poor results, a weighted average of the thickness measurements was
performed for each radiometer measurement.
Weights were calculated based on the radiometer response function which is almost
a perfect Gaussian up to about 45 degrees.
Points could be excluded based on distance along the flight
path.
For validation of sea ice emissivity forward model calculations, 
this was further refined by performing an emissivity calculation
for each thickness measurement and averaging over the radiometer
footprint.

'''Cristoforo Buondelmonti''' (1386 - c. 1430) was an [[Italy|Italian]] Franciscan priest and traveler, and a pioneer in promoting first-hand knowledge of [[Greece]] and its antiquities throughout the Western world.

He left his native city of [[Florence]], in [[Tuscany]], around 1414 C.E. in order to travel, mainly in the [[Aegean Islands]]. He visited [[Constantinople]] in the 1420s. He is the author of two historical-geographic works: the ''Descriptio insulae [[Crete|Cretae]]'' (1417, in collaboration with [[Niccolò Niccoli]]) and the ''Liber insularum [[Aegean Islands|Archipelagi]]'' (1420). These two books are a combination of geographical information and contemporary charts and sailing directions. The last one contains the oldest surviving map of Constantinople, and the only one which antedates the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of the city in 1453]].

While travelling over the island of Andros, he bought a Greek manuscript and brought back with him to Italy. This was the ''[[Horapollo#Hieroglyphica|Hieroglyphica]]'' of [[Horapollo]], which played a considerable role both in humanistic thinking and in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOISgWIQE7AC|title=The Survival of the Pagan Gods: The Mythological Tradition and Its Place in Renaissance Humanism and Art|last=Seznec|first=Jean|date=1981-01-01|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691029881|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1526">'''Cyclopean stairs''' form as a result of glacial erosion. The term refers to the longitudinal profile of a glaciated valley that has several consecutive [[hanging valley]]s.

==Formation==

There are a few different ways cyclopean stairs can form.

One way they form is through [[plucking (glaciation)|plucking]]. Different bedrock types may be more susceptible to plucking. If a highly [[Joint (geology)|jointed]] layer of bedrock is on the surface, large portions of it will be picked up by the glacier and deposited later as a [[glacial erratic]]. The valley formed in this fashion may have a steep wall at its head caused by a change in the bedrock type. The stronger bedrock will remain in the form of a riser at the end of a hanging valley.

Cyclopean stairs can also form at points where tributary glaciers feed into larger central glaciers. The tributary glacier causes the central glacier to thicken and downcut more rapidly. This may cause a very sudden drop in the valley floor at the points where the glaciers converged.

They may also form at the head of a glacier. In an area where the snowline is rising, the [[cirque (landform)|cirque]] in which the glacier forms my recede. A new cirque may form above the previous cirque and carve out a new step. As the snowline continues to rise, new cirques would continue to form the steps of the cyclopean stairs.

[[File:Belte inter.png|thumb|upright=1.8|"Belts" and "Sounds" in Denmark and southwestern Baltic Sea]]
The '''Danish straits''' are the [[straits]] connecting the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[North Sea]] through the [[Kattegat]] and [[Skagerrak]]. Historically, the Danish straits were internal waterways of [[Denmark]]; however, following territorial losses, [[Øresund]] and [[Fehmarn Belt]] are now shared with Sweden and Germany, while the [[Great Belt]] and the [[Little Belt]] have remained Danish [[territorial waters]]. The [[Copenhagen Convention of 1857]] made all the Danish straits an [[international waterway]].

==Toponymy and geography==
Five straits are named 'belt' (Danish: ''bælt''), the only ones in the world. Several other straits are named 'sound' (Danish, Swedish and German: ''sund''). Where an island is situated between a "belt" and a "sound", typically the broader strait is called "belt" and the narrower one is the "sound":

** separated from [[Fyn]] by the southern part of the ''Little Belt'', an area referred to in German (but not Danish) as ''Alsenbelt''

** separated from [[Lolland]] by ''Fehmarnbelt'' (German) / ''Femerbelt'' ([[Low German|Platt]]) / ''Femernbælt'' (former spelling: Femer Bælt)

==Etymology of "sound" / "sund"==
[[File:Aldersund.jpg|thumb|Sound/Sund: Aldersund separating Aldra island (left) from mainland Norway.]]
The [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word "sound" has the same root as the verb ''to sunder'' in the meaning of "to separate". The [[Old Norse]] form of that verb is ''sundr''. In Norway hundreds of narrow straits separating islands and combining [[fjords]] or outer parts of fjords are named "Sund".

Another explanation derives "sound" from an ancient verb "sund" in the meaning of to swim. That way a ''sound'' is a ''swimmable strait''. In the [[Swedish language]] any strait is called "sund".

The Germanic word "sound" is not related to the [[Romance languages]] originated word "sound", which has developed from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''sonus''.

[[Prizren]] is located on the slopes of the [[Šar Mountains]] ({{lang-sq|Malet e Sharrit}}) in the southern part of Kosovo. The municipality has a [[Border crossings of Albania|border]] with [[Albania]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. It was a historic capital of the [[Serbian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vickers| first=Miranda| title=The Albanians: A Modern History| publisher=I.B.Tauris| year=1999| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzI0uOZ2j6gC&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn=978-1-86064-541-9| page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Korishë/Koriš]] (population: 5,279) 
*[[Gjonaj/Gonj]] (population: 4,818)
Geographical and regional position of Prizren can bestly be examined with analysis of his position in relation to [[Kosovo]], and [[Metohija|Dukagjini]]’s area. [[Kosovo]] contains areas of Kosovo and [[Metohija|Dukagjini]].

Good geographical position, regional and rich natural resources, historical wealth of cultural artifacts form the basis of tourism development in the municipality of Prizren.&lt;ref name="rks-gov3"/&gt;

Prizren is an ancient city located along [[Šar Mountains|Sharri Mountains]] and along the river Lumbardhi.

The topography of Prizren has got a corrugated structure. Elevation ranges from 300 to 2,600 m within the boundaries.

While the city center is focused on flat surfaces, hilly topography is observed along the western side, especially along the eastern side.

===Forest surfaces===
Forest surfaces in Prizren are rich with endemic plant reserves especially the [[Bosnian pine]].&lt;ref name="rks-gov2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://kk.rks-gov.net/prizren/getattachment/03ac2853-7597-425f-a258-70a3fea221da/Plani-Zhvillimor-Komunal-i-Prizrenit-Faza-I.aspx# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002110538/http://kk.rks-gov.net/prizren/getattachment/03ac2853-7597-425f-a258-70a3fea221da/Plani-Zhvillimor-Komunal-i-Prizrenit-Faza-I.aspx# |archive-date=2013-10-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest surfaces in the National Park "[[Šar Mountains|Sharri Mountains]] " are known with natural values.

The total area of the municipality of Prizren is 63,986 ha. 53 % of this surface is agricultural land, 39% of forests and 8 % others.

==Hydrography==
From the total amount of precipitation that falls in the territory of [[Kosovo]], in [[Metohija|Dukagjini]] region fall about 800 mm in 1m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the surface, while in Kosovo, about 600 mm in 1m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. With rivers flows about 40 % of precipitation, while about 60 % evaporates its. The amount of water that flows into rivers is greater in late autumn and spring, and lower in summer and winter. The ratio between the maximum and minimum amounts of water flowing into [[Drin (river)|Drini i Bardhe]] is 8:1.&lt;ref name="sokol1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sokol58.com/Gjeografia/Kosova/Hidrografia%20e%20Kosov%C3%ABs.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-03-02 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140303104148/http://www.sokol58.com/Gjeografia/Kosova/Hidrografia%20e%20Kosov%C3%ABs.htm# |archive-date=2014-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maximum flow of water in rivers coming from [[Šar Mountains|Sharr Eastern Albanian Alps]], can sometimes be in late autumn ( November and December ), when these regions have uninterrupted rainfall for several days. Otherwise, due to the long and dry summer, with autumn rainfalls there is not much water in these rivers, while the underground reserves in the mountains are not filled up.&lt;ref name="sokol1"/&gt;

===Rivers and river basins===
Hydrography of the watercourses of Kosovo is divided into four river basins:&lt;ref name="ammk-rks1"/&gt; 
*[[Drin (river)|Drini i Bardhe]]
*Ibri
*Morava e Binçës
*[[Lepenci]].

The longest and the most important river in Prizren is [[Drin (river)|Drini i Bardhe]]( 122&amp;nbsp;km ),&lt;ref name="rks-gov3"/&gt; while Prizren Lumëbardhi is smaller with 31&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="ammk-rks2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/Resurset_ujore_te_Kosoves.pdf |title=Data |website=www.ammk-rks.net |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; All rivers flow into the [[Drin (river)|Drini i Bardhe]] river. The average length of the branches of [[Drin (river)|Drini i Bardhe]] is along the 45.8&amp;nbsp;km.

Along the center of Prizren passes the Lumbardhi River which is 35&amp;nbsp;km long.

Toplluha/Topluga River with a length of 37&amp;nbsp;km was declared as the river with the biggest risk of flooding.&lt;ref name="rks-gov3"/&gt;

===Watersheds===

Much of the territory of Kosovo belongs to the [[Black Sea]] basin, the rest, slightly smaller belongs to the Adriatic Sea basin and the remaining part belongs to the Aegean Sea basin.&lt;ref name="sokol1"/&gt;
* Rivers that belong to the [[Black Sea|Black Sea watersheds]] are: Sitnica, Ibri/Ibar, Drenica, Llapi/Lab, Morava e Binçes/ Binačka Morava and Krivareka.
* Rivers that belong to the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic Sea watershed]] are: [[Drin (river)|Drini i Bardhe]] with branches of the river of Istočka Bistrica, Pećka Bistrica, Dečanska Bistrica, Erenik, River of Prizren/Prizrenska Bistrica, Toplluha/Topluga, Mirusha, Klina and River of Plava, of Restelica.
* Rivers that belong to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean Sea watersheds]] are: [[Lepenci]] and Nerodimka.

Despite the larger area that belongs to the [[Black Sea]] basin, the rivers of the [[Adriatic Sea]] basin have large amounts of water, because on the basin of [[Drin (river)|Drini i Bardhe]] falls greater amount of rainfall, then because of the high mountains, in which during winter falls even more snow, which melts in the spring months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sokol58.com/Gjeografia/Kosova/Hidrografia%20e%20Kosov%C3%ABs.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-03-02 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140303104148/http://www.sokol58.com/Gjeografia/Kosova/Hidrografia%20e%20Kosov%C3%ABs.htm# |archive-date=2014-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prizren 2006.PNG|100px|left|thumb|Prizren 2006]]

==Borders==

Prizren borders with municipalities such as: [[Gjakovë]], [[Rahovec]], [[Shtërpcë]], [[Suharekë]], [[Dragash]] and in national borders with [[Albania]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. For this reason Prizren’s region is located at an altitude of about 400 meters and some of [[Šar Mountains|Sharri Mountains]] reach the height 2000 m above sea level.&lt;ref name="rks-gov1"/&gt;  They are surrounded by almost all sides with high mountains and present a set of clearly separated. [[Metohija|Dukagjini]]’s and Kosovo’s areas are in the middle part of the Balkans.

Prizren municipality borders in the north with municipalities of [[Suhareka]]/Suva Reka and [[Rahovec]]/ Orahovac, in the south of this municipality with [[Dragash]], in the east with Shtërrpcë/Štrpce and in west borders with the Republic of [[Albania]].Prizren is located off the European highway network.Many traffic routes pass through its territory.

However, natural predispositions provide favorable opportunities for connecting with neighboring regions more distant, while forming qualitative connections Prizren will have a much better position for both tourist and freight flows as more efficient connection and integration into wider spaces such as [[Kosovo]], [[Albania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], other border regions, and [[Europe]].

[[File:High Mountains In Prevalla.jpg|300px|thumb|High mountains In Prevalla]]

==Climate==
The climate of the city is extremely varied. In low areas due to the influence of the [[Mediterranean]] climate and very hot summers crops are among the first in [[Eastern Europe]] with the incomparable advantages for agricultural crops: grape vines, fruit and vegetables.

In rural regions, Alpine climate dominates, because until June into holes there are still several pieces of snow left where in the middle of the summer the top of mountains are full of snow.
This type of configuration gives preconditions for wealth and other resources, for example:
*Based on the amount of water it is one of the richest towns.
*This position creates all the preconditions for the development of agricultural crops, livestock, industrial food and tourism based on the model of [[Austria]], [[Slovenia]], [[Switzerland]].
* Through Prizren side passes the shortest route that unites the central part of the [[Balkans]] with the [[Adriatic sea]].

[[File:Hamami - Prizren.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Hamami - Prizren]]

==Historical conditions==

Historical conditions in earlier periods were not in a very good position relative to major traffic centers. Also there was not enough openness towards neighboring regions like [[Albania]], [[Montenegro]], Macedonia, causing Prizren not to use advantages that it has from pedological ground composition, climatic conditions of the [[Mediterranean climate]] and hydrological conditions for the development of agriculture and natural conditions for developing tourism and recreational activities. All this has affected the economic structure of Prizren.&lt;ref name="rks-gov1"/&gt;
According to the Spatial Plan of Kosovo, Prizren is known as a city museum, including antique values, cultural, historic and attractive development activities such as education, trade, tourism, agriculture, light food production, textile, pharmaceutical industry, etc.&lt;ref name="rks-gov2"/&gt; 
Physical profile hints that opening communication links with the neighboring regions is one of the main objectives of the development strategy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5374">The '''geology of [[Ecuador]]''' includes ancient Precambrian basement rock and a complex tectonic assembly of new sections of crust from formerly separate landmasses, often uplifted as the Andes or transformed into basins. 
==Geologic History, Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics==
Much of Ecuador is underlain by [[Precambrian]] igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rocks. The Piedras Group rocks date to the period and outcrop in El Oro Province on the western Andean slope in the southwest of the country and includes greenschist and [[amphibolite]] with small intercalations of quartz-[[sericite]] [[schist]] and [[quartzite]],dated to 743 million years ago in the [[Proterozoic]]. These high-grade, polymetamorphic rocks often signs of overprinting and green [[hornblende]] with a feather-like texture is found in the amphibolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1982)93&lt;87:TMBOE&gt;2.0.CO;2 |year=1982 |volume=93 |pages=87 |title=The metamorphic "basement" of Ecuador |journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin |last1=Feininger |first1=Tomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
Continental and oceanic terranes began to be added to western South America in the [[Mesozoic]]. In north-central Ecuador, the Peltetec-Portovelo fault marks the suture between the pre-existing South American craton and the Amotape-Chaucha terrane, which partially subducted beneath a preexisting Mesozoic continental arc system. The [[Triassic]] mafic and granitoid rocks of the El Oro metamorphic complex and the component [[eclogite]], blueschist and amphibolite are known as the Raspas metamorphic complex. This section of the terrane was previously subducted but brought to the surface with tectonic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1999)027&lt;0547:GWISAA&gt;2.3.CO;2 |title=Geochemical window into subduction and accretion processes: Raspas metamorphic complex, Ecuador |journal=Geology |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=547 |year=1999 |last1=Arculus |first1=R. J. |last2=Lapierre |first2=H. |last3=Jaillard |first3=É. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]] is recorded in the Triassic in Ecuador with S-type granite plutons, followed by the intrusion of calc-alkaline batholiths in the Jurassic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0040-1951(92)90426-7 |title=The geology and Mesozoic collisional history of the Cordillera Real, Ecuador |journal=Tectonophysics |volume=205 |pages=187–204 |year=1992 |last1=Aspden |first1=John A. |last2=Litherland |first2=Martin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oceanic basalts formed in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] were accreted to the edge of the continent as a separate terrane around 130 million years ago, forming a belt of basalt and [[diabase]], together with tuff, metasedimentary and sedimentary rocks running north-south into Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1986)14&lt;415:MOTITC&gt;2.0.CO;2 |year=1986 |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=415 |title=Mesozoic oceanic terrane in the central Andes of Colombia |journal=Geology |last1=Aspden |first1=J. A. |last2=McCourt |first2=W. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.3133/ofr82206 |chapter=K-Ar geochronology of basement rocks on the northern flank of the Huancabama deflection, Ecuador |title=Open-File Report |series=Open-File Report |year=1982 |last1=Feininger |first1=Tomas |last2=Silberman |first2=M.L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
Following the accretion of new terranes to the Western Cordillera, the [[Cenozoic]] brought the extensive uplift of the [[Andean orogeny]]. Volcanic rocks vary geochemically between the Western Cordillera and Eastern Cordillera. In the east, they are predominantly [[rhyolite]], [[andesite]] and andesitedacite while in the west, they are characteristically andesite and plagidacite. These are inferred to be the result of hydrous  partial melting of Basic Igneous Complex garnet amphibolite and amphibolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0377-0273(82)90029-4 |title=Geochemistry, petrology and origin of the Cenozoic volcanic rocks of the Northern Andes in Ecuador |journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research |volume=12 |issue=3–4 |pages=259–282 |year=1982 |last1=Hörmann |first1=Paul K. |last2=Pichler |first2=Hans }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural resource geology in Cenozoic rocks===
Most mineable deposits in Ecuador are either epithermal gold or porphyry copper hosted in [[Paleogene]] rocks, formed from the [[Eocene]] to the [[Miocene]]. They may have originated from an enriched mid-ocean ridge (MORB) basalt. Compared to other neighboring countries, copper deposits are comparatively small. Explanations have included a lack of development of magma chambers around nine million years ago due to the extent of compression in the Ecuadorian section of the Andes, or perhaps of a lack of exposure of deposits near the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00126-003-0397-5 |title=Cenozoic continental arc magmatism and associated mineralization in Ecuador |journal=Mineralium Deposita |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=204–222 |year=2004 |last1=Chiaradia |first1=Massimo |last2=Fontboté |first2=Lluís |last3=Beate |first3=Bernardo |url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/311310/files/126_2003_Article_397.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3044">The '''Gibe region''' is used to indicate a historic region in modern southwestern [[Ethiopia]], to the west of the [[Gibe River|Gibe]] and [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo River]]s, and north of the [[Gojeb River|Gojeb]]. It was the location of the former [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and [[Sidama people|Sidama]] kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Gera|Gera]], [[Kingdom of Gomma|Gomma]], [[Kingdom of Garo|Garo]], [[Kingdom of Gumma|Gumma]], [[Kingdom of Jimma|Jimma]], and [[Limmu-Ennarea]].

To the north of the Gibe region lay the [[Macha Oromo|Macha]] tribe of the Oromo.

Until the mid 16th century, this region was part of the [[Sidama]] kingdoms of [[Limmu-Ennarea|Ennarea]], [[Hadiya Kingdom|Hadiya]], [[Kingdom of Janjero|Janjero]] and [[Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa]], tributary states to the Ethiopian [[Solomonic dynasty]]. The area was separated however, when the Oromo migrated into the area, destroying Hadiya, isolating Janjero, and reduced the area of Enerea and Kaffa. In the Gibe region, the Oromo came under the cultural influence of the kingdom of Kaffa, from whom they borrowed the concept of hereditary kingship (called Moti in all of the kingdoms except Limmu-Enerea, where for historical reasons the king was known as the ''Supera''), and the practice of delimiting the boundaries or frontier of their states with a system of physical barriers.&lt;ref&gt;Described in detail in G.W.B. Huntingford, ''The Galla of Ethiopia; the Kingdoms of Kafa and Janjero'' (London: International African Institute, 1955), pp. 55ff&lt;/ref&gt;

These barriers consisted of palisades or [[dead hedge]]s, which could extend for miles, separated from the barriers of the neighboring kingdom by a neutral strip (called ''moga''), which was left uncultivated and inhabited only by brigands and outlaws. Access into each kingdom was limited to guarded gates known as ''kella'', where tolls were levied&lt;ref&gt;C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford, ''Some Records of Ethiopia, 1593-1646'' (London: Hakluyt Society, 1954), p. lxxviii. Also described in detail in Huntingford, ''The Galla of Ethiopia'', pp. 57f&lt;/ref&gt;

These kingdoms had an economy based on exports of [[gold]], [[civet]] musk, [[coffee]], and [[slavery|slave]]s. G.W.B. Huntingford explains that slaves were taken in raids on the Macha tribe to the north, and in raids on the Sidamo kingdoms of Kaffa and Janjero; he also cites evidence to show that 7,000 people a year were sold each year, some to people inside Ethiopia, and some outside that country.&lt;ref&gt;Huntingford, ''The Galla of Ethiopia'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gibe region, with the rest of southwestern Ethiopia, was almost entirely annexed between 1886 and 1900 in a series of conquests by the generals of Emperor [[Menelik II]]. The kingdom of Jimma, through skillful diplomacy, managed to delay this fate until the death of its king [[Abba Jifar II]] in 1932.

The '''Global Earth Observation System of Systems''' ('''GEOSS''') is being built{{needs update|date=June 2018}} by the [[Group on Earth Observations]] (GEO) on the basis of a 10-Year Implementation Plan running from 2005 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/geoss/ US Environmental Protection Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; GEOSS seeks to connect the producers of environmental data and decision-support tools with the end users of these products, with the aim of enhancing the relevance of Earth observations to [[global issue]]s. GEOSS aims to produce a global public infrastructure that generates comprehensive, near-real-time environmental data, information and analyses for a wide range of users. The Secretariat Director of Geoss is Barbara Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthobservations.org/ag_geosec_d.shtml Group on Earth Observations &amp;mdash; The GEO Secretariat Director] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010224031/http://www.earthobservations.org/ag_geosec_d.shtml |date=October 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earth observation systems ==
[[Earth observation]] systems consist of instruments and models designed to measure, monitor and predict the physical, chemical and biological aspects of the Earth system. Buoys floating in the oceans monitor temperature and salinity; meteorological stations and balloons record air quality and rainwater trends; sonar and radar systems estimate fish and bird populations; seismic and [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) stations record movements in the Earth’s crust and interior; some 60-plus high-tech environmental satellites scan the planet from space; powerful computerized models generate simulations and forecasts; and early warning systems issue alerts to vulnerable populations.

These various systems have typically operated in isolation from one another. In recent years, however, sophisticated new technologies for gathering vast quantities of near-real-time and high-resolution Earth observation data have become operational. At the same time, improved forecasting models and decision-support tools are increasingly allowing decision makers and other users of Earth observations to fully exploit this widening stream of information.

With investments in Earth observations now reaching a critical mass, it has become possible to link diverse observing systems together to paint a full picture of the Earth’s condition. Because the costs and logistics of expanding Earth observations are daunting for any single nation, linking systems together through international cooperation also offers cost savings.

==Implementation==
As a networked system, GEOSS is owned by all of the GEO Members and Participating Organizations. Partners maintain full control of the components and activities that they contribute to the system of systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/research/environment/geo/article_2450_en.htm European Commission]
&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation is being pursued through a Work Plan consisting of over 70 tasks. Each task supports one of the nine societal-benefit or four transverse areas and is carried out by interested Members and Participating Organizations. Governments and organizations have also advanced GEOSS by contributing a variety of “Early Achievements”; these “First 100 Steps to GEOSS” were presented to the 2007 Cape Town Ministerial Summit.

Interlinking observation systems requires common standards for architecture and data sharing. The architecture of an Earth observation system refers to the way in which its components are designed so that they function as a whole. Each GEOSS component must be included in the GEOSS registry and configured so that it can communicate with the other participating systems. In addition, each contributor to GEOSS must subscribe to the GEO data-sharing principles, which aim to ensure the full and open exchange of data, metadata and products. These issues are fundamental to the successful operation of GEOSS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.directionsmag.com/editorials.php?article_id=2026&amp;trv=1 Directions Magazine]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grss-ieee.org/menu.taf?menu=geoss&amp;detail=Standards Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geossregistries.info/ GEOSS Registries]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/45609/story.htm Reuters]
&lt;/ref&gt;

GEOSS will disseminate information and analyses directly to users. GEO is developing the GEOPortal as a single Internet gateway to the data produced by GEOSS. The purpose of GEOPortal is to make it easier to integrate diverse data sets, identify relevant data and portals of contributing systems, and access models and other decision-support tools. For users without good access to high-speed internet, GEO has established GEONETCast, a system of four communications satellites that transmit data to low-cost receiving stations maintained by the users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Nov27/0,4670,ObservingEarth,00.html Associated Press]
&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, GEONETCast seems still in its infancy, yet some tools have already been worked out. The [http://www.itc.nl/Pub/Organization/Geonetcast-Toolbox.html GEONETCast toolbox] has been made available and contains tools to access some radar altimetry, vegetation, satellite prediction and maritime information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itc.nl/PDF/Organisation/Scientific%20departments/WRS/other_tools.pdf Information available through GEONETCast]&lt;/ref&gt; Other useful information available through GEONETCast is vegetation and desert locust information provided under the DevCoCast project, which is a subproject of GEONETCast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devcocast.eu/ViewContent.do?pageId=130 Useful data from DevCoCast project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://endeleo.vgt.vito.be/ ENDELEO, a useful vegetation map allowing comparison of vegetation over time, part of "Kenyan Forests" DevCoCast project]&lt;/ref&gt;

==User groups==
The growing demand for Earth observation data and information is the driving force behind GEOSS. The GEOSS Implementation Plan identifies nine distinct groups of users and uses, which it calls “[[Societal Benefit Areas]]”. The nine areas are disasters, health, energy, climate, water, weather, ecosystems, agriculture and biodiversity. Current and potential users include decision makers in the public and private sectors, resource managers, planners, emergency responders and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gbif.org/Events/geoss2006 Global Biodiversity Information Facility]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geoss-ecp.org/ GEO Energy Community of Practice]

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related initiatives ==
GEOSS can be characterized as a contribution towards the establishment of a [[spatial data infrastructure]]. 
It is one of three related initiatives that are the subject of the GIGAS (GEOSS, [[Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community|INSPIRE]] and [[Copernicus Programme|GMES]] an Action in Support) harmonization project under the auspices of the [[European Union|EU]] [[7th Framework Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegigasforum.eu/project/project.html The GIGAS Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Hans Kinzl was born in [[Upper Austria]] in 1899. After his studies of geography at the University of Innsbruck he became assistant of his mentor [[Johann Sölch]]—disciple of [[Albrecht Penck]]—in Innsbruck. He then followed Sölch—who succeeded [[Alfred Hettner]] in Heidelberg—but returned to the University of Innsbruck where he became a professor of geography.&lt;ref&gt;Penz, Hugo (1997): ''Hans Kinzl (1898-1979) und das Institut für Geographie der Universität Innsbruck.

== Research ==
Apart from the European Alps, his focus was on the Peruvian Andes where he conducted [[Glaciology|glaciological]], [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]], [[Agricultural research|agricultural]] and [[Population geography|population research]]. Hans Kinzl is best known for his 1930's maps of the [[Cordillera Blanca]] mountain range located in Peru. He later became the head of the Geographical Department of the [[University of Innsbruck]].

It is a fitting name for an instrument which can be used to "turn" incoming sunlight (via reflection).

Heliotropes were used in surveys from Gauss's survey in Germany in 1821 through the late 1980s, when GPS measurements replaced the use of the heliotrope in long distance surveys. [[George Everest|Colonel Sir George Everest]] introduced the use of heliotropes into the [[Great Trigonometric Survey]] in India around 1831,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings in science, Volume 3|year=1831|publisher=Baptist Mission Press|page=344|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5xlwAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=heliotrope}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the US Coast and Geographic Survey used heliotropes to survey the United States. The [https://archive.org/details/gov.in.is.9898.1981 Indian specification for heliotropes] was updated in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Specification for Heliotrope, Surveying|year=1981|publisher=Indian Standards Institution|url=https://archive.org/details/gov.in.is.9898.1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the American military specification for heliotropes (MIL-H-20194E) was retired on 8 December 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIL-H-20194E Note 1|publisher=Assistdocs.com | url= http://assistdocs.com/search/document_details.cfm?ident_number=14150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Surveyor (surveying)|Surveyors]] used the heliotrope as a specialized form of survey target; it was employed during large [[triangulation]] surveys where, because of the great distance between stations (usually twenty miles or more), a regular target would be indistinct or invisible. Heliotropes were often used as survey targets at ranges of over 100 miles. In California, in 1878, a heliotrope on [[Mount Saint Helena]] was surveyed by B.A. Colonna of the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|USCGS]] from [[Mount Shasta]], a distance of 192 miles (309&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;[http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/theodolites/heliotrope.html Theodolites: heliotrope] at [[NOAA]].gov&lt;/ref&gt;

The heliotrope was limited to use on sunny days and was further limited (in regions of high temperatures) to mornings and afternoons when [[Aberration in optical systems|atmospheric aberration]] least affected the instrument-man's line of sight.&lt;ref name=1900_12_Weather_Review&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abbe|first=Cleveland|title=Meteorology and Geodesy|journal=Monthly Weather Review|date=December 1900|volume=XXVIII|issue=12|pages=545–547|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W8NGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA546&amp;dq=heliotrope+seeing|accessdate=10 July 2013|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1900)28[545:mag]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The heliotrope operator was called a "heliotroper" or "flasher" and would sometimes employ a second mirror for communicating with the instrument station through heliography, a signalling system using impulsed reflecting surfaces. The inventor of the [[heliograph]], a similar instrument specialized for signaling, was inspired by observing the use of heliotropes in the survey of [[India]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3326">'''Horticultural oils''' or '''narrow range oils''' are lightweight oils, either petroleum or vegetable based. They are used in both [[horticulture]] and [[agriculture]], where they are applied as a dilute spray on plant surfaces to control [[insect]]s and [[mite]]s. They are also sometimes included in tank mixes as a [[surfactant]].

The oils provide control by smothering the target [[Pest (organism)|pest]]s, and are only effective if applied directly to the pest, and provide no residual controls.

Oils are generally considered suitable for 'organic pest control', with most oils permitted under the [[National Organic Program|U.S. National Organic Program]].

==Terms used to describe oils==
'''Dormant oil:''' An oil used on woody plants during the dormant season. This term originally referred to heavier weight, less well-refined oils that were unsafe to use on plants after they broke dormancy. However, these older oils have been replaced with more refined, light-weight oils that have potential application to plant foliage. Dormant oil now refers to the time of application rather than to any characteristic type of oil.

'''Horticultural oils:''' An oil used to control a pest on plants.

'''Mineral oil:''' A petroleum-derived oil (as opposed to vegetable oils).

'''Narrow-range oil:''' A highly refined oil that has a narrow range of distillation. Narrow-range oils fall in the superior oil classification. The terms may be used nearly interchangeably.

'''Spray oil:''' An oil designed to be mixed with water and applied to plants as a spray for pest control.

'''Summer oil:''' An oil used on plants when foliage is present (also called foliar oils). As with dormant oil, the term now refers to the time an application is made rather than to the properties of the oil.

'''Supreme oil:''' A term used to categorize highly refined oils that distill at slightly higher temperatures and over a wider range than the narrow-range oils. Most supreme oils meet the characteristics of a superior oil.

'''Superior oil:''' A term originated by P.J. Chapman in 1947 to categorize summer-use oils that met certain specifications. This included a high proportion of paraffinic hydrocarbons and purification that allowed year-round use without [[phytotoxicity]]. Since then, further developments have resulted in oils that distill over a narrow temperature range. Most superior oils are now better referred to as narrow-range oils.

'''Vegetable oil:''' An oil derived from the seeds of some oil seed crop (e.g., soybeans, canola, cottonseed).

'''Huckleberry Botanic Regional Preserve''' is a {{convert|241|acre|km2}} [[regional park]] and [[nature reserve]] in the [[Berkeley Hills]], in the eastern [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] of [[California]]. It is within [[Alameda County, California|Alameda]] and [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa Counties]].&lt;ref name="ebrpd"&gt;[http://www.ebparks.org/parks/huckleberry EBRPD-huckleberry "Huckleberry Botanic Regional Preserve." East Bay Regional Parks District] Accessed November 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a park within the [[East Bay Regional Parks District]] system.&lt;ref name="ebrpd"/&gt; The Preserve is named after the [[Vaccinium ovatum|California Huckleberry]] (''Vaccinium ovatum'') which grows abundantly within its [[habitat]].&lt;ref name="ebrpd"/&gt;

==Geography==
The Huckleberry Botanic Regional Preserve is on the crest of the [[Oakland Hills]], located above [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Orinda, California|Orinda]]. It represents a relic plant association found only in certain areas along the coastal climate region of California, where specific soil and climatic conditions still exist.&lt;ref name="ebrpd"/&gt; It is a very diverse botanical area for [[native plant]]s of the [[California mixed evergreen forest|mixed evergreen forest]] and [[California montane chaparral and woodlands|montane chaparral and woodlands]] [[ecoregion]]s and [[plant community|plant communities]]. Trails connect the preserve with [[Robert Sibley Volcanic Preserve]] on the north, and Redwood Regional Park on the south.&lt;ref name="OWiki"&gt;[https://oaklandwiki.org/Huckleberry_Botanic_Regional_Preserve "Huckleberry Botanic Regional Preserve." Oakland Wiki.] Accessed September 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Huckleberry Trail is a {{convert|1.7|mile|km}} self-guided nature path that loops through the Preserve.&lt;ref name="ebrpd"/&gt; Besides the California Huckleberry, other plants include the [[Chrysolepis#Species|Golden chinquapin]] (''Chrysolepis chrysophylla''), and [[Umbellularia|California Bay]] (''Umbellularia californica'') and [[Coast live oak]] (''Quercus agrifolia'') woodlands.&lt;ref name="ebrpd"/&gt;

==Visitation==
The park is open year-round, between 5:00 AM and 10:00 PM daily, unless otherwise posted. No dogs are permitted in the park because of the sensitive plant habitat. There are no reservable campgrounds or picnic sites. Parking is free.&lt;ref name="ebrpd"/&gt;

[[File:Beacons by jnxyz.education (13570846665).jpg|thumb|Smartphone detecting an iBeacon transmitter]]
'''iBeacon''' is a protocol developed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and introduced at the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first= | last= | coauthors= | title= iOS: Understanding iBeacon |date=February 2015 | publisher=Apple Inc | url =https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202880 | work = | pages = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Various vendors have since made iBeacon-compatible hardware transmitters&amp;nbsp;– typically called beacons&amp;nbsp;– a class of [[Bluetooth low energy]] (BLE) devices that broadcast their identifier to nearby [[Mobile computing|portable electronic]] devices. The technology enables [[smartphone]]s, [[computer tablet|tablet]]s and other devices to perform actions when in close proximity to an iBeacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bfonics Inc.|url=http://bfonics.com/what_is_beacon.php|publisher=Bfonics.com|accessdate=10 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108070354/http://bfonics.com/what_is_beacon.php|archivedate=8 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=18 January 2015 | title=Beacons: Everything you need to know.|url=http://www.pointrlabs.com/blog/beacons-everything-you-need-to-know/|publisher=Pointrlabs.com | accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

iBeacon is based on [[Bluetooth low energy#Proximity sensing|Bluetooth low energy proximity sensing]] by transmitting a [[universally unique identifier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daveaddey.com/?p=1252 |title=iBeacons |publisher=Dave Addey |date=2013-09-22 |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014352/http://daveaddey.com/?p=1252 |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; picked up by a compatible app or operating system.  The identifier and several bytes sent with it can be used to determine the device's physical location,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.appleinsider.com/t/158126/inside-ios-7-ibeacons-enhance-apps-location-awareness-via-bluetooth-le |title=Inside iOS 7: iBeacons enhance apps' location awareness via Bluetooth LE |publisher=Forums.appleinsider.com |date=2013-06-18 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; track customers, or trigger a [[Location-based service|location-based]] action on the device such as a [[Check-in#Social network|check-in on social media]] or a [[Mobile marketing|push notification]].

iBeacon can also be used with an application as an [[indoor positioning system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meetingofideas.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/ibeacons-bible-1-0.pdf |title=iBeacon Bible |publisher=Andy Cavallini |date= |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automatedhome.co.uk/apple/apple-ibeacons-explained-smart-home-occupancy-sensing-solved.html |title=Apple iBeacons Explained – Smart Home Occupancy Sensing Solved? |publisher=Automated Home |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iBeacon- The game changer in InStore Navigation|url=http://technoparkliving.com/2013/12/ibeacon-the-game-changer-in-instore-navigation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which helps smartphones determine their approximate location or context.  With the help of an iBeacon, a smartphone's software can approximately find its relative location to an iBeacon in a store. [[Brick and mortar]] retail stores use the beacons for [[mobile commerce]], offering customers special deals through [[mobile marketing]],&lt;ref name="mcforbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2014/12/18/mcdonalds-ibeacon/|title=Apple iBeacons Find Their Way Into McDonald's|work=Forbes|date=18 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can enable [[mobile payment]]s through [[point of sale]] systems.

Another application is distributing messages at a specific [[Point of Interest]], for example a store, a bus stop, a room or a more specific location like a piece of furniture or a vending machine. This is similar to previously used geopush technology based on [[GPS]], but with a much reduced impact on battery life and better precision.

iBeacon differs from some other location-based technologies as the broadcasting device (beacon) is only a 1-way transmitter to the receiving smartphone or receiving device, and necessitates a specific app installed on the device to interact with the beacons. This ensures that only the installed app (not the iBeacon transmitter) can track users, potentially against their will, as they passively walk around the transmitters.

iBeacon compatible transmitters come in a variety of form factors, including small coin cell devices, USB sticks, and generic Bluetooth 4.0 capable USB [[dongles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://learn.adafruit.com/pibeacon-ibeacon-with-a-raspberry-pi/overview |title=Overview  piBeacon  DIY iBeacon with a Raspberry Pi  Adafruit Learning System  |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:An assortment of iBeacon from different vendors.jpg|thumb|An assortment of iBeacons from different vendors]]

==Functions==
An iBeacon deployment consists of one or more iBeacon devices that transmit their own unique identification number to the local area.  Software on a receiving device may then look up the iBeacon and perform various functions, such as notifying the user.  Receiving devices can also connect to the iBeacons to retrieve values from iBeacon's GATT ([[List of Bluetooth profiles|generic attribute profile]]) service.  iBeacons do not push notifications to receiving devices (other than their own identity). However, mobile software can use signals received from iBeacons to trigger their own push notifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://myorpheo.com/push-notifications-visitors/ | title=Push Notifications for Visitors | date=2014-11-04 | publisher=MyOrpheo | access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Region monitoring===
Region monitoring is limited to 20 regions and can function in the background (of the listening device) and has different delegates to notify the listening app (and user) of entry/exit in the region - even if the app is in the background or the phone is locked.  Region monitoring also allows for a small window in which iOS gives a closed app an opportunity to react to the entry of a region.

===Ranging===
As opposed to monitoring, which enables users to detect movement in-and-out of range of the beacons, ranging provides a list of beacons detected in a given region, along with the estimated distance from the user's device to each beacon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.estimote.com/hc/en-us/articles/203356607-What-are-region-Monitoring-and-Ranging-|title=What are region Monitoring and Ranging?|publisher=estimote.com|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ranging works only in the foreground but will return (to the listening device) an array (unlimited) of all iBeacons found along with their properties ([[UUID]], etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19477044/ibeacon-in-the-background-use-cases/19485055#19485055|title=Charles Capps - iBeacon in the background|publisher=Stackoverflow.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An iOS device receiving an iBeacon transmission can approximate the distance from the iBeacon.  The distance (between transmitting iBeacon and receiving device) is categorized into 3 distinct ranges:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j87D-6JA0g8&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UUPDVZSYjQUryXa_hehQaV5g&amp;index=10|title=What is a Beacons Range Video Tutorial|work=YouTube|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Immediate: Within a few centimeters
* Near: Within a couple of meters
* Far: Greater than 10 meters away

An iBeacon broadcast has the ability to approximate when a user has entered, exited, or lingered in region.  Depending on a customer's proximity to a beacon, they are able to receive different levels of interaction at each of these three ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19007306/what-are-the-nominal-distances-for-ibeacon-far-near-and-immediate |title=What are the nominal distances for iBeacon "Far", "Near", and "Immediate" |publisher=Stackoverflow.com|date=|accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum range of an iBeacon transmission will depend on the location and placement, obstructions in the environment and where the device is being stored (e.g. in a leather handbag or with a thick case). Standard beacons have an approximate range of 70 meters. Long range beacons can reach up to 450 meters.

===Settings===
The frequency of the iBeacon transmission depends on the configuration of the iBeacon and can be altered using device specific methods.  Both the rate and the transmit power have an effect on the iBeacon battery life.  iBeacons come with predefined settings and several of them can be changed by the developer, including the rate, the transmit power, and the Major and Minor values.  The Major and Minor values are settings which can be used to connect to specific iBeacons or to work with more than one iBeacon at the same time.  Typically, multiple iBeacon deployment at a venue will have the same UUID, and use the major and minor pairs to segment and distinguish subspaces within the venue.  For example, the Major values of all the iBeacons in a specific store can be set to the same value and the Minor value can be used to identify a specific iBeacon within the store.

==Power consumption==
[[File:New Battery Life of iBeacons.png|thumb|300px|right|upright|Comparison of 16 major beacon hardware of battery life in months (higher is better) by Aislelabs' The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/beacon-guide/ |title=The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware: A Comprehensive Report by Aislelabs |publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-11-03|accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Bluetooth LE protocol is significantly more power efficient than Bluetooth Classic. Several chipsets makers, including [[Texas Instruments]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/tis-support-of-apples-ibeacon-adds-enterprise-iot-heft/ | title=TI's support of Apple's iBeacon adds enterprise, IoT heft | last=Dignan | first=Larry | date=2014-04-14 | publisher=ZD Net | access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nordic Semiconductor]] now supply chipsets optimized for iBeacon use. Power consumption depends on iBeacon configuration parameters of advertising interval and transmit power.  A study on 16 different iBeacon vendors reports that battery life can range between 1–24 months. Apple's recommended setting of 100 ms advertising interval with a coin cell battery provides for 1–3 months of life, which increases to 2–3 years as advertising interval is increased to 900 ms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9to5mac.com/2014/11/03/best-ibeacon-hardware-stress-test-battery-life/ |title=Best iBeacon hardware crowned following extensive stress tests |publisher= 9to5 mac|date=2014-11-03|accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Battery consumption of the phones is a factor that must be taken into account when deploying beacon-enabled apps. A recent report has shown that
older phones tend to draw more battery in the vicinity of iBeacons, while the newer phones can be more efficient in the same environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/07/09/retailers-are-excited-about-beacons-but-how-fast-will-they-drain-your-smartphone-battery/ |title=Retailers are excited about beacons, but how fast will they drain your smartphone battery? |publisher= GIGAOM|date=2014-07-09|accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the time spent by the phone scanning, number of scans and number of beacons in the vicinity are also significant factors for battery drain, as pointed out by the [[Aislelabs]] report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/ibeacon-battery-phones/ |title=iBeacon and Battery Drain on Phones: A Technical Report |publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-07-09|accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a follow-up report, Aislelabs found a drastic improvement in battery consumption for iPhone5S, iPhone 5C versus the older model iPhone 4S.
At 10 surrounding iBeacons, iPhone 4S can consume up to 11% of battery per hour whereas iPhone5S consumes a little less than 5% battery per hour.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aislelabs.com/reports/ibeacon-battery-drain-iphones/ |title=iBeacon Battery Drain on Apple vs Android: A Technical Report - Aislelabs |publisher= Aislelabs|date=2014-08-14|accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
An energy efficient iBeacon application needs to consider these aspects in order to strike a good balance between app responsiveness and battery consumption.

==History and developments==
In mid-2013 [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] introduced iBeacons and experts wrote about how it is designed to help the retail industry by simplifying payments and enabling on-site offers. On December 6, 2013, Apple activated iBeacons across its 254 US retail stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/apple-launches-ibeacon-in-254-stores-to-streamline-shopping-experience-7000024026/ |title=Apple launches iBeacon in 254 stores to streamline shopping experience |publisher=ZDNet |date= |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald's has used the devices to give special offers to consumers in its fast-food stores.&lt;ref name="mcforbes"/&gt;

As of May 2014, different hardware iBeacons can be purchased for as little as $5 per device to more than $30 per device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vincenth.net/blog/archive/2014/04/24/building-cross-platform-ibeacon-apps-for-ios-android-and-windows-with-c-and-xamarin.aspx |title=Building Cross-Platform iBeacon Apps for iOS, Android and Windows with C# and Xamarin |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each of these different iBeacons have varying default settings for their default transmit power and iBeacon advertisement frequency. Some hardware iBeacons advertise at as low as 1&amp;nbsp;Hz while others can be as fast as 10&amp;nbsp;Hz.

iBeacon technology is still in its infancy.  One well reported software quirk exists on 4.2 and 4.3 Android systems whereby the system's bluetooth stack crashes when presented with many iBeacons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.radiusnetworks.com/2014/04/02/a-solution-for-android-bluetooth-crashes.html |title=A Solution for Android Bluetooth Crashes |publisher=Developer.radiusnetworks.com|date=|accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was reportedly fixed in Android 4.4.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=67272 |title=Android Issue Tracker|publisher=code.google.com|accessdate=2015-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical details==
[[Bluetooth low energy]] devices can operate in an advertisement mode to notify nearby devices of their presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warski.org/blog/2014/01/how-ibeacons-work/ |title=How do iBeacons work?  Blog of Adam Warski |publisher=Warski.org|date=|accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the simplest form, an iBeacon is a Bluetooth low energy device emitting advertisement following a strict format, that being an Apple defined iBeacon prefix, followed by a variable UUID, and a major, minor pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibeacon.com/what-is-ibeacon-a-guide-to-beacons/ | title=What is iBeacon? A guide to iBeacon | publisher=ibeacon.com | accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example iBeacon advertisement frame could look like:
 fb0b57a2-8228-44&amp;nbsp;cd-913a-94a122ba1206 Major 1 Minor 2
where '''fb0b57a2-8228-44&amp;nbsp;cd-913a-94a122ba1206''' is the UUID.
Since iBeacon advertisement is just an application of the general Bluetooth low energy advertisement, the above iBeacon can be emitted by issuing the following command on Linux to a supported Bluetooth 4 Low Energy device on a modern kernel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21124993/is-there-a-way-to-increase-ble-advertisement-frequency-in-bluez |title=Is there a way to increase BLE advertisement frequency in BlueZ? |publisher=Stackoverflow.com|date=|accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Devices running the [[Android operating system]] prior to version 4.3 can only receive iBeacon advertisements but cannot emit iBeacon advertisements. Android 5.0 ("Lollipop") added the support for both central and peripheral modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/article/221089/SDK-will-let-Android-users-join-the-iBeacon-party |title=SDK will let Android users join the iBeacon party |publisher=MobilePaymentsToday.com |date=2013-10-11 |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212060343/http://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/article/221089/SDK-will-let-Android-users-join-the-iBeacon-party |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Android iBeacon Support==
Unlike iOS, Android does not have native iBeacon support.  Due to this, to use iBeacon on Android, a developer either has to use an existing library or create code that parses BLE packets to find iBeacon advertisements.
BLE support was introduced in [[Android Jelly Bean]] with major bug fixes in [[Android KitKat]]. Stability improvement and additional BLE features have been progressively added there after, with a major stability improvement in version 6.01 of [[Android Marshmallow]] that prevents inter-app connection leaking.

==Spoofing==
By design, the iBeacon advertisement frame is plainly visible.
This leaves the door open for interested parties to capture, copy and reproduce the iBeacon advertisement frames at different physical locations.
This can be done simply by issuing the right sequence of commands to compatible Bluetooth 4.0 USB dongles.
Successful spoofing of Apple store iBeacons was reported in February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21955246/how-to-prevent-spoofing-of-ibeacons |title=android - How to prevent spoofing of iBeacons? - Stack Overflow |publisher=Stackoverflow.com|date=|accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is not a security flaw in the iBeacon per se, but application developers must keep this in mind when designing their applications with iBeacons.

[[PayPal]] has taken a more robust approach, where the iBeacon is purely the start of a complex security negotiation ([[Challenge–response authentication]]). This is not likely to be hacked, nor is it likely that it would be disrupted by copies of beacons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.verifone.com/media/3603729/bluetooth-low-energy-beacons-retail-wp.pdf |title=Bluetooth Low Energy, Beacons and Retail - VeriFone Systems, Inc. |publisher=Global.verifone.com|date=|accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Listening for iBeacon can be achieved using the following commands with a modern Linux distribution:
 hcitool -i hci0 lescan—passive
 D6:EE:D4:16:ED:FC (unknown)
 F6:BE:90:32:3C:5E (unknown)
 ...
On another terminal, launch the protocol dump program:
 hcidump -R -i hci0
 &gt; 04 3E 2A 02 01 00 01 '''FC ED 16 D4 EE D6''' 1E 02 01 06 1A FF 4C
   00 02 15 '''B9 40 7F 30 F5 F8 46 6E AF F9 25 55 6B 57 FE 6D''' ED
   FC D4 16 B6 B4
 ...

The [[MAC address]] of the iBeacon along with its iBeacon payload is clearly identifiable.  The sequence of commands in [[#Technical details|technical details]] can then be used to reproduce the iBeacon frame.

'''ISO 3166-2:LS''' is the entry for [[Lesotho]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Lesotho, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[districts of Lesotho|10 districts]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|LS}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Lesotho. The second part is a letter (A&amp;ndash;K except I).

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''John Bartholomew Sr.''' (26 April 1805 &amp;ndash; 8 April 1861) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[cartography|cartographer]] and [[engraver]].

== Life ==
The son of George Bartholomew, engraver (1784–1871), he founded the engraving and mapmaking firm of [[John Bartholomew and Son Ltd.]] in 1826. Bartholomew also worked for [[George Philip &amp; Son]].

He was a master copper plate engraver and engraved some fine maps for local Edinburgh firms, such as street maps for [[William Home Lizars|Lizars]], others for the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] and for some educational publishers like [[A &amp; C Black]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bartholomew 150 Years|author=Leslie Gardiner|publisher=John Bartholomew &amp; Son Ltd|isbn=0-85152-791-4|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was commissioned to engrave the map of [[Treasure Island]] for [[Robert Louis Stevenson]].

John Sr. was the ideal person to inaugurate what became one of the most admired cartographic institutions in the world. A man of high standards, as were his successors; he was an accomplished engraver, engraving becoming the foundation of the firm; [[lithography]] would follow later. He also had the vision to recognise the potential for the firm. He was a shy man, holding back from public life.

In 1832–1833 James was living at 4 East St James Street, since demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/83399739|title=Edinburgh Post Office annual directory, 1832-1833|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, shortly before he died, John Senior passed the business on to his son [[John Bartholomew]] Junior (1831–1893).

The '''Karoo''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|r|uː}} {{respell|kə|ROO|'}}; from a [[Khoikhoi language|Khoikhoi]] word, possibly ''garo'' "desert"&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|karoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a semi [[desert]] [[natural region]] of South Africa. No exact definition of what constitutes the Karoo is available, so its extent is also not precisely defined. The Karoo is partly defined by its topography, [[Karoo Supergroup|geology]] and climate, and above all, its low rainfall, arid air, cloudless skies, and extremes of heat and cold.&lt;ref name=Standard&gt;Potgieter, D.J. &amp; du Plessis, T.C. (1972) ''Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa''. Vol. 6. pp. 306-307. Nasou, Cape Town.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Readers&gt;''Reader’s Digest Illustrated Guide to Southern Africa''. (5th Ed. 1993). pp. 78-89. Reader’s Digest Association of South Africa Pty. Ltd., Cape Town.&lt;/ref&gt; The Karoo also hosted a well-preserved ecosystem hundreds of million years ago which is now represented by many fossils.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/759.full.pdf |author1=Sahney, S.  |author2=Benton, M.J. | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65|format=PDF | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Karoo formed an almost impenetrable barrier to the interior from Cape Town, and the early adventurers, explorers, hunters, and travelers on the way to the [[Highveld]] unanimously denounced it as a frightening place of great heat, great frosts, great floods, and great droughts.&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;Palmer, E. (1966) ''The Plains of Camdeboo''. p. 12-13, 120, 126, 140-146. Fontana/ Collins, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is still a place of great heat and frosts, and an annual rainfall of between 50 and 250&amp;nbsp;mm, though on some of the mountains it can be 250 to 500&amp;nbsp;mm higher than on the plains.&lt;ref name=Standard /&gt; However, underground water is found throughout the Karoo, which can be tapped by boreholes, making permanent settlements and sheep farming possible.&lt;ref name=Standard /&gt;&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt; 
  
The [[Xerophyte|xerophytic]] vegetation consists of [[aloe]]s, [[mesembryanthemum]]s, [[crassula]]s, [[euphorbia]]s, [[stapelia]]s, and [[Ephemeral plant|desert ephemerals]], spaced 50&amp;nbsp;cm or more apart,&lt;ref name=Standard /&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica''. Micropaedia, Vol. 6. (2007). p.750. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; and becoming very sparse going northwards into [[Bushmanland, Northern Cape|Bushmanland]] and, from there, into the [[Kalahari Desert]]. The driest region of the Karoo, however, is its southwestern corner, between the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] and the [[Cederberg|Cederberg-Skurweberg mountain ranges]], called the [[Tankwa Karoo National Park|Tankwa Karoo]], which receives only 75&amp;nbsp;mm of rain annually.&lt;ref name=Standard /&gt; The eastern and north-eastern Karoo are often covered by large patches of grassland. The typical Karoo vegetation used to support large game, sometimes in vast herds.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Conolly&gt;Conolly, D. (1992). ''Conolly’s Guide to Southern Africa''. (5th Ed.) pp. 106-117. Conolly Publishers, Scottburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, sheep thrive on the xerophytes, though each sheep requires about 4 ha of grazing to sustain itself.&lt;ref name=Standard /&gt;

==Divisions==
The Karoo is distinctivly divided into the Great Karoo and the Little Karoo by the [[Swartberg|Swartberg Mountain Range]], which runs east-west, parallel to the southern coastline, but is separated from the sea by another east-west range called the [[Outeniqua Mountains|Outeniqua–Langeberg Mountains]]. The Great Karoo lies to the north of the Swartberg range; the Little Karoo is to the south of it.

===Great Karoo===
[[File:Karoo national park.jpg|thumb|left|A view from the top of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] in the [[Karoo National Park]] near [[Beaufort West]], looking south across the plains of the Lower Karoo: Note the remnants of the former extent of the central plateau on the plain below the escarpment (see diagram on the right). Also note the [[dolerite]] sills which top the escarpment and mountains in the middle distance, giving these structures their characteristic flat-topped appearance.]]  
[[File:The Great Escarpment.jpg|thumb|A stylized illustration of the Great Escarpment, based particularly on its appearance in the Great Karoo, where thick erosion resistant dolerite sills (see below; represented here by the thick black lines. The thinner dolerite sills are not drawn in this diagram to avoid clutter) generally form the upper, sharp edge of the escarpment. (In other parts of the escarpment, hard erosion-resistant geological layers similarly form the upper, abrupt edge.) Note the island remnants of the earlier extent of the plateau on the plain below the escarpment (the Lower Karoo), left behind as the escarpment has gradually eroded further inland.&lt;ref name= McCarthy1&gt;McCarthy, T.S. (2013) The Okavango delta and its place in the geomorphological evolution of Southern Africa. ''[[South African Journal of Geology]]'' 116: 1-54.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The only sharp and definite boundary of the Great Karoo is formed by the most inland ranges of [[Cape Fold Mountains]] to the south and south-west. The extent of the Karoo to the north is vague, fading gradually and almost imperceptibly into the increasingly arid [[Bushmanland, Northern Cape|Bushmanland]] towards the north-west. To the north and north-east, it fades into the savannah and grasslands of  [[Griqualand West]] and the Highveld.&lt;ref name= Altas /&gt;&lt;ref name=Norman &gt;Norman, N., Whitfield, G. (2006) ''Geological Journeys''. p. 206-223, 243-247, 252-273, 300-311. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary to the east grades into the grasslands of the Eastern Midlands.&lt;ref name=grassland&gt;Grassland biome. {{cite web |url=http://www.plantzafrica.com/vegetation/grassland.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018003144/http://www.plantzafrica.com/vegetation/grassland.htm |archivedate=18 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Great Karoo is itself divided by the Great Escarpment into the Upper Karoo (generally above 1200&amp;ndash;1500&amp;nbsp;m) and the Lower Karoo on the plains below at 700&amp;ndash;800&amp;nbsp;m.
A great many local names, each denoting different subregions of the Great Karoo, exist, some more widely, or more generally, known than others. In the Lower Karoo, going from west to east, they are  the [[Tankwa Karoo National Park|Tankwa Karoo]], the Moordenaarskaroo, the Koup, the Vlakte, and the [[Camdeboo National Park|Camdeboo Plains]].  The Hantam, Kareeberge,  Roggeveld, and uweveldare the better known subregions of the Upper Karoo, though most of it is simply known as the Upper Karoo, especially in the north.&lt;ref name= Altas /&gt;

===Little Karoo===
The Little Karoo’s boundaries are sharply defined by mountain ranges to the west, north, and south. The road between Uniondale and Willowmore is considered, by convention, to form the approximate arbitrary eastern extremity of the Little Karoo. Its extent is much smaller than that of the Great Karoo.&lt;ref name= Altas /&gt; Locally, it is usually called the ''Klein Karoo'', which is [[Afrikaans]] for Little Karoo.

==Geography==
===Great Karoo===
The Great Karoo straddles the 30° S parallel on the west of the continent, in a similar position to other semidesert areas on earth, north and south of the equator. It is furthermore in the rainfall shadow of the Cape Fold Mountains along the western coastline.&lt;ref name= Altas /&gt; 
The western "Lower Karoo" (the Tankwa Karoo and Moordenaarskaroo) contain remnants of the Cape Fold Mountains&lt;ref name=geologicalmap&gt;''Geological Map of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland''. (1970). Council for Geoscience, Geological Survey of South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. the Witteberg and Anysberg Mountains)&lt;ref name= Altas /&gt; which give it a moderate hilly appearance, but further east, the Lower Karoo becomes a monotonously flat plain.  The "Upper Karoo" has been intruded by [[dolerite]] [[Sill (geology)|sills]] (see below),&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;McCarthy, T., Rubridge, B. (2005). ''The Story of Earth and Life. '' p. 89-90, 102-107, 134-136,159-161, 195-211, 248-254. Struik Publishers, Cape Town&lt;/ref&gt; creating multiple flat-topped hills, or Karoo Koppies, which are iconic of the Great Karoo.

The vegetation of the Upper is similar to the Lower Karoo, so few people make a distinction between the two.

The main highway (the N1) and railway line from Cape Town to the north enter the Lower Karoo from the [[Hex River Valley]] just before [[Touws River (town)|Touws River]] and follow a course about 50&amp;nbsp;km south of the Great Escarpment up to [[Beaufort West]]. Thereafter, they gradually ascend the Great Escarpment along a broad valley to Three Sisters on the [[South Africa#Geography|Central Plateau]] and the Upper Karoo.

Turning north from the N1 between Touws River and Beaufort West, at [[Matjiesfontein]], the road ascends the Great Escarpment through the [[Roggeveld Mountains|Verlatenkloof Pass]] to reach [[Sutherland, Northern Cape|Sutherland]], at 1456&amp;nbsp;m above sea level, which is reputedly the coldest town in South Africa with average minimum temperatures of -6.1&amp;nbsp;°C during winter.&lt;ref name=Bulpin&gt;Bulpin, T.V. (1992). ''Discovering Southern Africa''. pp. 271-274, 301-314. Discovering Southern Africa Productions, Muizenberg.&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of eastern the [[Mpumalanga]]n Highveld do at times experience lower temperatures than Sutherland, but not as consistently as Sutherland does.&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt; Snowfalls are not infrequent during the southern winter months.  The [[South African Astronomical Observatory]] has an emplacement of telescopes about 20&amp;nbsp;km east of the town, on a small plateau 1798&amp;nbsp;m above sea level, and is home to the [[Southern African Large Telescope]], the largest optical telescope in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacetoday.org/DeepSpace/Telescopes/SALT.html|title=Deep Space Observatories: The Southern African Large Telescope |publisher=Space Today Online|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physikinstrumente.com/en/news/fullnews.php?newsid=31|title=273 Precision Actuators for the Largest Telescope in the Southern Hemisphere|date=May 2003|publisher=Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH &amp; Co. KG.|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the north, still on the Plateau, and 75&amp;nbsp;km north-west of [[Carnarvon, Northern Cape|Carnarvon]], seven radio dishes form part of the [[Square Kilometer Array]] which will, 2500 in total,  be scattered in other parts of South Africa and Australia, to survey the southern skies at radio frequencies. Our [[galaxy]], the [[Milky Way]], one of the main targets of this enterprise, is best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Karoo [http://www.southafrica.net/za/en/articles/entry/article-southafrica.net-the-magical-great-karoo]. Accessed 2014-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Upper Karoo is indeed an ideal site for an astronomical observatory. This is not only because of the clear skies, absence of artificial lights, and high altitude, but it is also tectonically completely inactive, meaning that there are no fault lines or volcanoes are nearby,&lt;ref name=geologicalmap /&gt; so no earth tremors or [[earthquakes]] occur, even at great distances.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1975); Macropaedia, Vol. 17. p. 60. Helen Hemingway Benton Publishers, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Little Karoo===
The Little Karoo is separated from the Great Karoo by the Swartberg Mountain range. 
Geographically, it is a 290-km-long valley, only 40&amp;ndash;60&amp;nbsp;km wide,  formed by two parallel [[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Fold Mountain]] ranges, the [[Swartberg]] to the north, and the continuous [[Langeberg]]-[[Outeniqua Mountains|Outeniqua]] range to the south. The northern strip of the valley, within 10&amp;ndash;20&amp;nbsp;km from the foot of the Swartberg mountains is least karoo-like, in that it is a well-watered area both from the rain and the many streams that cascade down the mountain, or through narrow [[Defile (geography)|defiles]]  in the Swartberg from the Great Karoo. The main towns of the region are situated along this northern strip of the Little Karoo: [[Montagu, Western Cape|Montagu]], [[Barrydale]], [[Ladismith]], [[Calitzdorp]], [[Oudtshoorn]], and [[De Rust]], as well as such well-known mission stations such as [[Zoar, South Africa|Zoar]], [[Amalienstein]], and [[Dysselsdorp]].

[[File:Swartberg01.jpg|thumb|left|400 px|Farmlands along the well-watered, fertile foothills of the more than 2000-m-high [[Swartberg|Swartberg Mountains]] (in the background) along the northern strip of the Little Karoo]]
The southern 30– to 50-km-wide strip, north of the Langeberg range, is as arid as the western Lower Karoo, except in the east, where the Langeberg range (arbitrarily) starts to be called the Outeniqua Mountains.

The Little Karoo can only be accessed by road through the narrow defiles cut through the surrounding Cape Fold Mountains by ancient, but still flowing, rivers. A few roads traverse the mountains over passes, the most famous and impressive of which is the [[Swartberg Pass]] between Oudtshoorn in the Little Karoo and [[Prince Albert, Western Cape|Prince Albert]] on the other side of the Swartberg mountains in the Great Karoo. Also, the main road between Oudtshoorn and George, on the coastal plain, crosses the mountains to the south via the [[Outeniqua Pass]]. The only exit from the Little Karoo that does not involve crossing a mountain range is through the 150-km-long, narrow [[Langkloof]] valley between Uniondale and Humansdorp, near [[Plettenberg Bay]].

==Geology of the Karoo==
===The Great Karoo===
{{main|Karoo Supergroup }}
[[File:Geology of Karoo Supergroup.png|thumb|left|300 px|A schematic geological map of the outcrops (surface exposures) of the Karoo Supergroup rocks in Southern Africa: The location and approximate structure of the Cape Fold Mountains are also diagrammatically indicated for reference purposes.]]

In geological terms, the [[Karoo Supergroup]] refers to an extensive and geologically recent (180&amp;ndash;310&amp;nbsp;million years old) sequence of sedimentary and igneous rocks,&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; which is flanked to the south by the [[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Fold Mountains]], and to the north by the more ancient Ventersdorp Lavas, the [[Transvaal Basin|Transvaal Supergroup]] and [[Waterberg Biosphere|Waterberg Supergroup]].&lt;ref name=geologicalmap /&gt; It covers two-thirds of South Africa and extends in places to 8000&amp;nbsp;m below the land surface, constituting an immense volume of rocks which was formed, geologically speaking, in a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bulpin | first = Thomas Victor | title = Scenic Wonders of Southern Africa | publisher = Books of Africa | series = | chapter = 7.

Although almost the whole of the Great Karoo is situated on Karoo Supergroup rocks, the geological Karoo rocks extend over a very much larger area, both within South Africa and Lesotho, but also beyond its borders and onto other continents that formed part of [[Gondwana]].&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt;&lt;ref name=geologicalmap /&gt;&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt;

The Karoo Supergroup was formed in vast inland basin starting 320&amp;nbsp;million years ago, at a time when the part of Gondwana which would eventually become Africa lay over the South Pole.&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, A.A., Stone, P. (2008). ''Bedrock Geology UK South''. p. 6-7. Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey.&lt;/ref&gt; Icebergs that had calved off the glaciers and ice sheets to the north deposited a 1-km-thick layer of mud containing [[Glacial erratics|dropstones]] of varying origins and sizes into this basin. This became the [[Karoo Supergroup#Dwyka group|Dwyka Group]] consisting primarily of [[tillite]], the lowermost layer of the Karoo Supergroup.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; As Gondwana drifted northwards, the basin turned into an inland sea with extensive swampy deltas along its northern shores. The peat in these swamps eventually turned into large deposits of coal which are mined in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] and on the Highveld. This 3-km-thick layer is known as the [[Karoo Supergroup#Ecca group|Ecca Group]], which is overlain by the 5.6-km-thick  [[Karoo Supergroup#Beaufort group|Beaufort Group]], laid down on a vast plain with Mississippi-like rivers depositing mud from an immense range of mountains to the south.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; Ancient [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s prospered in the wet forests, and their remains have made the Karoo famous amongst [[palaeontologist]]s. The first of these Karoo fossils was discovered in 1838 by Scots-born [[Andrew Geddes Bain]] at a road cutting near Fort Beaufort. He sent his specimens to the [[British Museum]], where fellow Scotsman [[Robert Broom]] recognised the Karoo fossils' mammal-like characteristics in 1897.&lt;ref name=RDigest&gt;{{cite book | last = Walton | first = Christopher (ed.) | title = Atlas of Southern Africa | publisher = The Reader's Digest Association South Africa | series = | chapter = Anatomy of South Africa: 200 million years ago | edition = | location =  | year = 1984 | pages = 14–15 | doi = | isbn = 0-947-008-02-0 | mr = | zbl = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Beaufort period, Southern Africa (still part of Gondwana) became an arid sand desert with only ephemeral rivers and pans. These sands consolidated to form the [[Karoo Supergroup#Stormberg group|Stormberg Group]], the remnants of which are found only in the immediate vicinity of Lesotho. Several dinosaur nests, containing eggs, some with dinosaur fetal skeletons in them, have been found in these rocks, near what had once been a swampy pan.&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite web

Finally, about 180 million years ago, [[volcanic]] activity took place on a titanic scale, which brought an end to a flourishing reptile evolution.&lt;ref name=RDigest /&gt; These genera represent some of the extinct, mainly predinosaur, animals of the Karoo:

[[File:Karoo Koppies Calvinia.jpg|thumb|left|500 px|Flat-topped hills (called Karoo Koppies) are highly characteristic of the southern and southwestern Karoo landscape.]]
Karoo Koppies hills are capped by hard, erosion-resistant [[dolerite]] [[Sill (geology)|sills]]. This is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo’s geology]]. This occurred about 180 million years ago, when huge volumes of lava were extruded over most of Southern Africa and adjoining regions of Gondwana, both on the surface and deep below the surface between the sedimentary strata. Since this massive extrusion of lava, Southern Africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion, exposing the older, softer rocks, except where they were protected by a cap of dolerite. &lt;!-- Also see the Gallery at the end of this article --&gt; The genera present include:

* ''[[Mesosaurus]]'', aquatic Dwyka carnivore
* ''[[Bradysaurus]]'', [[Beaufort Group]] herbivore
* ''[[Diictodon]]'', [[Permian]] [[Synapsid|mammal-like reptile]]
* ''[[Rubidgea]]'', Permian predator
* ''[[Lystrosaurus]]'', [[Triassic]] mammal-like herbivore
* ''[[Thrinaxodon]]'', Triassic mammal-like carnivore
* ''[[Euparkeria]]'', [[Archosauria|early dinosaur]]
* ''[[Massospondylus]]'', late Triassic to early [[Jurassic]] herbivorous, bipedal dinosaur
* ''[[Megazostrodon]]'', [[Mammaliaformes|early mammal]]&lt;ref name = RDigest/&gt;

The lava outpourings that ended the Karoo deposition of rocks, not only covered the African surface, and other parts of Gondwana with a 1.6&amp;nbsp;km thick layer basaltic lava,&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; but it also forced its way, under high pressure, between the horizontal layers of sedimentary rocks belonging to the Ecca and Beaufort groups, to solidify into [[dolerite]] [[Sill (geology)|sills]]. The long vertical fissures through which the lava welled up solidified into [[Dike (geology)|dikes]] which resemble the [[Great Wall of China]] from the air.&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt; 
From about 150&amp;nbsp;million years ago the South African surface has been subjected to an almost uninterrupted period of erosion, particularly during the past 20&amp;nbsp;million years,&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; shaving off many kilometers of sediments. This exposed the dolerite sills, which were more resistant to erosion than the Karoo sediments, forming one of the most characteristic features of the Karoo landscape, namely the flat topped hills, called "Karoo Koppies".

===Geology of the Little Karoo===
The geology of the region bears no resemblance to that of the Great Karoo  (see the diagram on the left, of a NS geological cross-section through the Little and Great Karoos).&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt; The valley is an integral part of the Cape Fold Mountain Belt, with the two ranges on either side composed of extremely hard, erosion-resistant, [[Quartzite|quartzitic]] [[sandstone]] belonging to the 450- to 510-million-year-old Table Mountain Group (i.e. the oldest layer of the Cape Supergroup). The valley floor is covered, in the main, by the next (younger) layer of the Supergroup, namely the much softer [[Bokkeveld Group|Bokkeveld]] shales. The dolerite of the Great Karoo did not penetrate these rocks, so Karoo Koppies are not seen in the Little Karoo.&lt;ref name=geologicalmap /&gt;

The Little Karoo contains two other geological features that give the landscape a special character. During the erosion of the African interior following the bulging of the continent during the massive lava outpourings that ended the Karoo sedimentation 180&amp;nbsp;million years ago, some of the eroded material was trapped in the valleys of the Cape Fold Mountains, especially during the [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous period]], about {{ma|cretaceous|{{period start error|cretaceous}}}} to {{Ma|paleocene|million}} years ([[Megaannum#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]) ago. These "Enon [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerates]]", as they are known, were deposited by high energy, fast flowing rivers,&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; and are found between Calitzdorp and Oudtshoorn, where they form the strikingly red "Redstone Hills".&lt;ref name= Altas /&gt;&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt;&lt;ref name=geologicalmap /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt;&lt;ref name=road&gt;Van Deventer, L. &amp; McLennan, B. (eds) (2010). "The Little Karoo" in ''South Africa by Road, a Regional Guide''. p. 58-61. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second special geological feature that marks the Little Karoo is the 300-km-long fault line along the southern edge of the Swartberg Mountains. The Swartberg Mountains were lifted up along this fault, to such an extent that in the Oudtshoorn region, the rocks that form the base of the Cape Supergroup are exposed. These are locally known as the Cango Group, but are probably continuous with the [[Marine geology of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay#The geological structure of the region|Malmesbury Group]] that forms the base of [[Table Mountain]] on the [[Cape Peninsula]], and similar outcrops in the [[Western Cape]].&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt;  In the Little Karoo, the outcrop is composed of [[limestone]], into which an underground stream has carved the impressively extensive [[Cango Caves]].&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt;&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt;&lt;ref name=geologicalmap /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt;

==Karoo flora==
[[File:Karoo ecoregion.jpg|thumb|Two separate and independent Karoo [[biome]]s, or botanical regions, of South Africa bear the name Karoo: the [[Succulent Karoo]] to the west of green line, and the Nama Karoo to the east.]]

namely the [[Succulent Karoo|Succulent Karoo biome]] and the [[Nama Karoo biome]], both of which, like the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo Geological System]], are more extensive than the geographical or historical Karoo described in South African atlases and guide books (compare the map on the right with the map at the beginning of the article).&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt;&lt;ref name=TimesAltas&gt;''The Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World''.

===Succulent Karoo biome===
{{main|Succulent Karoo}}
The Succulent Karoo biome runs along the [[South Africa#Geography|West Coast]], from approximately [[Lamberts Bay]] northwards to over 200&amp;nbsp;km into southern [[Namibia]].&lt;ref name=succkaroo&gt;''Succulent Karoo''.

Accessed 30 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It starts in the south just north of the [[Veld#Sandveld and Hardveld|Sandveld]] geographical region, about 250&amp;nbsp;km north of Cape Town, and continues through [[Namaqualand]], the [[Richtersveld]], immediately south of the [[Orange River]], and on into the Namaqualand or Namaland region of southern [[Namibia]]. None of these regions is ever referred to, either geographically or locally, as "Karoo".&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt; However, it has a major extension inland into the [[Tankwa Karoo National Park|Tankwa Karoo]] and Moordenaarskaroo regions of the Lower Karoo, and adjoining Upper Karoo region of the geographic Great Karoo. It also occurs to the south, in part of the [[Breede River Valley]], as the [[Robertson Karoo]]. From here, it continues eastwards into the western half of the Little Karoo.&lt;ref name= Altas /&gt;&lt;ref name=Standard /&gt;&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt;&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt;&lt;ref name= TimesAltas /&gt; 
[[File:Namaqualand, Goegap 0035.jpg|thumb|left|Spring flowers in Namaqualand]]
The Succulent Karoo biome is dominated by dwarf, leafy-succulent shrubs, and annuals, predominantly [[Asteraceae]], popularly known as Namaqualand daisies, which put on spectacular flower displays covering vast stretches of the landscape in the southern spring-time (August–September) after good rains in the winter. Grasses are uncommon, making most of the biome unsuitable for grazing. The low rainfall, in fact, discourages most forms of agriculture. An exception is the thriving ostrich-farming industry in the Little Karoo, which is heavily dependent on supplementary feeding with [[Alfalfa|lucerne]].&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt; The difference between the Succulent Karoo biome and the Nama Karoo biome is that the former receives the little rain that falls as cyclonic rainfall in winter, which has less erosive power than the infrequent but violent summer thunderstorms of the Nama Karoo.&lt;ref name=succkaroo /&gt; Frost is also less common in the Succulent Karoo biome than in the Nama Karoo biome.&lt;ref name=succkaroo /&gt; The number of mainly succulent plant species is very high for an arid area of this size anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name=succkaroo /&gt;

===Nama Karoo biome===
{{main|Nama Karoo}}
The Nama Karoo biome is located entirely on the central plateau mostly at altitudes between 1000 and 1500&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=Nama&gt;''The Nama Karoo Biome''.

Much of the Nama Karoo biome is used for sheep and goat farming, providing mutton, wool, and pelts for local and international markets, especially since livestock can frequently be provided with a regular supply of water from boreholes. Overgrazing exacerbates the erosion caused by the violent thunderstorms that occur, infrequently, in the summer. It also promotes the replacement of the grasses by shrubs, especially the less edible varieties such as the threethorn (''Rhigozum trichotomum''), bitterbos (''Chrysocoma ciliate''), and sweet thorn (''Acacia karroo'').&lt;ref name=Nama /&gt;&lt;ref name=namakaroo /&gt; However, there are few rare or Red Data Book plant species in the Nama Karoo biome.&lt;ref name=Nama /&gt;&lt;ref name=namakaroo /&gt;

==Karoo fauna==
===Great Karoo===
The Great Karoo used to support a large variety of [[antelope]] (particularly the [[springbok]]), the [[quagga]], and other large game, especially on the grassy flats in the east. [[Francois Le Vaillant]], the famous French explorer, naturalist, and ornithologist, who traveled through the Great Karoo in the 1780s, killed a [[hippopotamus]] in the Great Fish River in the Karoo (and ate its foot for breakfast). He also recorded that he saw the spoor of a [[rhinoceros]] near Cranemere, in the [[Camdeboo National Park|Camdeboo Plains]] (eastern Lower Karoo). [[Elephant]] tusks have been found by farmers in the Camdeboo district, but no records exist of any having been seen alive in that region.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;
The quagga roamed the Karoo in great numbers together with [[wildebeest]] and [[ostrich]]es, which always seemed to accompany them.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; These quagga seemed gentle and easy to domesticate. (A pair of quagga was used to draw a horse carriage through London, more for curiosity than for any superiority the quagga might have had over a horse.)  They were consequently also easy prey for hunters, who hunted them for sport rather than their meat.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; By the middle of the 1800s, they were almost extinct, and in 1883, the last one died in an Amsterdam zoo.

[[File:Quagga.jpg|thumb|Painting of a quagga stallion in [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s menagerie at Versailles by Nicolas Marechal, 1793]]
Probably the strangest and most puzzling zoological phenomenon in the Great Karoo was the periodic, unpredictable appearance of massive springbok migrations.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Conolly /&gt; These migrations always came from the north, and could either go west towards Namaqualand and the sea, south-west through towns such as [[Beaufort West]], or south through the Camdeboo district. These vast herds moved steadily and inexorably across the plains, trampling all before them, including their own kind. Le Vaillant gave the first eye-witness account of such a migration in 1782.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; He rode through the herd filling the Plains of Camdeboo,   seeing neither the beginning nor end of the moving mass.
 
[[File:Antidorcas marsupialis, male (Etosha, 2012).jpg|thumb|left|A [[springbok]], one of Southern Africa's most well-known antelopes or [[gazelles]]]]
In 1849, a massive herd of springbok, amongst which were intermingled wildebeest, [[blesbok]], quagga, and [[Common eland|eland]], moved through Beaufort West. Early one morning, the town was awakened to a sound like that of a strong wind, and suddenly the town was filled with animals. They devoured every sprig of foliage in the town and surrounding countryside. The last of the continuously moving herd left the town 3 days later, to disappear towards the west. The Karoo looked as if a fire had swept through it. During these migrations, the plains and hillsides on every side were thickly covered by one vast mass of springbok, packed like sheep in a fold. As far as the eye could see, the landscape was alive with them.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; 
  
During these migrations, the springbok never ran or trotted. On the whole, they were silent, except for the shudder of their stamping hoofs. Nothing could divert them, and hunters could ride amongst them, shooting them at random, without apparently causing alarm. People could move amongst them and kill them with sticks, or cripple them by seizing a leg and breaking it. Not only people  followed these herds for the easy meat they provided, but also [[lion]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[cheetah]]s, [[Lycaon pictus|African wild dogs]], [[hyena]]s, and [[jackal]]s preyed on them.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;

No one knew how, why, or where these migrations started, nor where they ended, nor did anyone know if these animals ever returned to where they had started. The migrations were always unidirectional, from north of the Great Karoo.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;

Great locust swarms also frequently invaded or arose in the Great Karoo, and still occur from time to time today.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;

The [[riverine rabbit]], a critically endangered animal, lives exclusively in seasonal river basins and a very particular set of scrubland in the central semiarid region in the Karoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Bunolagus_monticularis/|title=Bunolagus monticularis riverine rabbit |last= |first= |date= |website=Animal Diversity Web|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hunted by [[Falconidae|falconiformes]] and [[Verreaux's eagle]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.biodiversityexplorer.org/mammals/lagomorpha/bunolagus_monticularis.htm|title=Bunolagus monticularis (Riverine rabbit) |last= |first= |date=|website=Biodiversity Explorer|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its numbers have been consistently lowering due to destruction of its habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/3326/0|title=Bunolagus monticularis|last=|first=|date=|website=IUCN Redlist |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are unique relative to similar species through how they are polygamous and how each female can only produce one or two offspring per year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The introduction of the windpump to tap the Great Karoo’s underground water resources in the late 1800s made permanent human habitation and sheep farming possible over large parts of the Great Karoo for the first time.&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt; As a result, the teeming number of large antelope in the Karoo has dwindled into insignificance, and with them, the large carnivores have all but disappeared. Today, the [[caracal]] (7&amp;ndash;19&amp;nbsp;kg),&lt;ref name=mammals&gt;Stuart, C. &amp; Stuart, T (2007). ''Field Guide to Mammals of Southern Africa'' p. 136, 170, 176. Struik, Cape Town&lt;/ref&gt; [[black-backed jackal]] (6&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;kg),&lt;ref name=mammals /&gt; [[Verreaux's eagle]] (3.0&amp;ndash;5.8&amp;nbsp;kg) and the [[martial eagle]] (3.0&amp;ndash;6.2&amp;nbsp;kg)&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Hockey, P.A.R., Dean, W.R.J. &amp; Ryan, P.G.

(2002) ''Raptor Identification Guide for Southern Africa''.  pp. 62, 82. Rollerbird Press, Pinegowrie.&lt;/ref&gt;  are arguably the largest predators likely to be seen in the Great Karoo today. [[Leopards]] (20&amp;ndash;90&amp;nbsp;kg) do occur, especially in the mountains, but are very secretive, so are rarely seen.&lt;ref name=mammals /&gt; Many of the animals that formerly inhabited the Karoo in large numbers, including lions, have been reintroduced to the area in nature reserves and game farms.

===Little Karoo===
As in the Great Karoo, antelope and other big game inhabited the Little Karoo in the past. However, the dominant zebra was not the quagga, but the [[Cape mountain zebra]], (''Equus zebra zebra'') which is adapted for life on rugged, mountainous terrain. Their hooves are harder and faster-growing than those of [[Burchell’s zebra]] (''Equus quagga burchellii''), which lives on the plains.&lt;ref name=Harley&gt;Moodley, Y. &amp; Harley, E.H. (2006) Population structuring in mountain zebra (''Equus zebra''):the molecular consequences of divergent histories. ''Conservation Genetics''. {{doi|10.1007/s10592-005-9083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two species are, therefore, rarely seen in the same habitat. The quagga is closely related to Burchell's zebra, and appears also to have been confined to the plains.

The mountain zebra occurred in the mountain regions of the Cape Fold Belt and along the southern portion of the Great Escarpment. Thus, they were endemic to, amongst others, the western Lower Karoo and the Little Karoo. However, they were hunted to near extinction, leaving fewer than 100 individuals by the 1930s. Conservation efforts since then brought their numbers up to 1200  by 1998, mainly by concentrating these zebra in nature reserves and protected areas, the most well-known of these being the [[Mountain Zebra National Park]] near [[Cradock, Eastern Cape|Cradock]] in the Great Karoo. Cape mountain zebras are still found in protected areas managed by Cape Nature, including the Kamanassie and [[Gamkaberg Nature Reserve]]s.

The ostrich]is found throughout Africa, but the most handsome specimens came from the Little Karoo, where the dry weather, but plentiful water in the streams formed an ideal habitat for these large, flightless birds. Here, they grow to over 2&amp;nbsp;m in height, and weigh over 100&amp;nbsp;kg. The male’s feathers have been prized by many cultures in Africa, Europe ,and Asia over thousands of years.&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt; In the 1860s, a farmer in the [[Graaff-Reinet]] district was apparently the first person to demonstrate that the ostrich could successfully be domesticated, bred in captivity, and the eggs hatched in incubators, while still producing the magnificent feathers.&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt;  This idea was quickly adopted by farmers in the Little Karoo, where they started growing lucerne as the birds’ favorite food. During 1880, no less than 74,000&amp;nbsp;kg of feathers were exported, and in 1904, it passed the 210,000-kg mark.&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt;
 
The First World War brought about a slump in the ostrich feather market, but the industry recovered in later years, when not only the feathers were sought after, but also ostrich leather, and its meat, which is very tasty, and a major export item. Today, several farms can be visited by tourists, near Oudtshoorn, the center of the ostrich industry.&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt;

==Modern history==
===Great Karoo===
The first European settlers landed in the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, and between 1659 and 1664, made several unsuccessful attempts to penetrate the Great Karoo from the south-west.&lt;ref name=Standard /&gt; The Europeans who first entered the Great Karoo did so from the south-east (traveling north from [[Algoa Bay]]), which is slightly less arid than the western Karoo.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt; These were the ''[[trekboers]]'' of the mid-1700s, who led a nomadic existence, enduring great hardships in the relentless aridity, the intense heat (such that even their dogs could not walk on the scorching ground and had to be lifted into the overcrowded wagons), and the bitter cold in winter, especially at night.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; Before that time, the only inhabitants were the [[Khoisan]], who lived in small family groups and, it is believed, remained largely in their own "territories", killing their own game, and gathering bulbs and roots and drinking from a spring or other water source within their territory.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt;  Sometimes these territories were very large and the family group moved from one part to the other. Their only domestic animals were dogs.&lt;ref name=Palmer /&gt; The [[Bantu peoples|Bantu people]] to the east of the Great Karoo did not occupy this arid region due to the scarce rainfall which prevented the farming of cattle.
[[File:Karoo sunset with windmill.JPG|thumb|left|Sunset in the Great Karoo, near Sutherland, showing a multibladed windpump, which has made permanent settlement and farming possible in this thirsty land. These windpumps are as iconic of the Great Karoo as are the flat-topped Karoo Koppies.]]
In 1854, [[Daniel Halladay]] invented the multibladed [[windpump]] (windmill) in the USA.  It was perfected in 1883, and soon South Africa (and elsewhere) produced them in large numbers. These windpumps transformed the Great Karoo, making permanent settlement and stock farming (predominantly sheep)&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt; possible over large parts of the Karoo for the first time.&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt; Like the Karoo Koppie, the multibladed windpump became an iconic feature of the Great Karoo.
Sheep farming and the fencing off of the land have meant that antelope numbers have dwindled significantly, and with them, the big carnivores. Leopards still occur in the mountains, but lions now only occur in nature reserves, where they have been recently reintroduced into the Great Karoo.
[[File:Milner Hotel, Matjiesfontein.jpg|thumb|left|The Lord Milner Hotel in [[Matjiesfontein]], in the Lower Karoo, next to the Matjiesfontein railway station, on the railway line from Cape Town to Johannesburg]] 
In 1872, construction was started to connect the [[Cape Colony]]’s coastal railway system with the [[Kimberley, Northern Cape#History|diamond fields]] in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]],&lt;ref&gt;Burman, Jose (1984). ''Early Railways at the Cape''. Cape Town. Human &amp; Rousseau, p.95. {{ISBN|0-7981-1760-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Royal Colonial Society: ''Proceedings of the Royal Colonial Institute''. Northumberland Avenue, London. 1898. p.26. "The Railway System of South Africa".&lt;/ref&gt; The new line started in [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]] and entered the Lower Karoo through the [[Hex River Mountains|Hex River valley]], where it followed a course almost midway between the Swartberg Mountains to the south and the Great Escarpment to the north. Along the way, it passed through the quaint Victorian village of [[Matjiesfontein]], with the historic Lord Miner Hotel, which is still operational today. The railway reached this point in 1878, before proceeding to Beaufort West at the foot of the Great Escarpment. From there, it reached the top of the African Plateau near Three Sisters along a valley with such a low gradient that passengers were (and still are)  hardly aware that they were ascending the Great Escarpment. From there it continued through the Upper Karoo, to [[De Aar]], and crossed the Orange River at [[Hopetown]], where South Africa’s first diamond, the [[Eureka Diamond]], was found. The Orange River, at this point, forms the local unofficial boundary between the Great Karoo and the Highveld.&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt;

The line reached Kimberley in 1885, and has since been extended via [[Botswana]] (then Bechuanaland) to reach [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]] (when they were still known as South and North Rhodesia), and branch lines have been constructed to  [[Namibia]]  and [[Port Elizabeth]] through a hub at De Aar, in the Great Karoo. Further branch lines were later built from points further north to [[Bloemfontein]], [[Durban]], and, of course, to [[Johannesburg]].

[[Image:Burgersdorp-Sentinel-001.JPG|thumb|A blockhouse in the eastern Karoo]]
During the Second [[Second Boer War|Anglo-Boer War]] of 1899–1902, three Republican [[commando]] units, reinforced by the sympathizers ("rebels") from the [[Cape Colony]], conducted widespread operations throughout the Karoo. Countless skirmishes took place in the region, with the [[Calvinia]] magisterial district, in particular, contributing a significant number of fighters to the Republican cause. Fought both conventionally and as a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] struggle over the Karoo's vast expanses, it was a bloody war of attrition wherein both sides used newly developed technologies to their advantage. Numerous abandoned [[blockhouse]]s can still be seen at strategic locations, especially along the railway line, throughout the Great Karoo. A prime example still "guards" a bridge over the [[Groot River (Southern Cape)|Buffels River]], {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the east of the town of [[Laingsburg, Western Cape|Laingsburg]], in the Lower Karoo, between Matjiesfontein and Beaufort West.

Recently, nature reserves and [[game farm]]s have been established in many parts of the Great Karoo, turning what was once regarded as a forbiddingly desolate and unattractive geographical barrier into a tourist destination.

===Little Karoo===
This area was explored by European settlers in the late 17th century, who encountered the Khoisan people as the original inhabitants of this area. The latter called the Swartberg Mountains ''kango'' meaning "a place rich in water".&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt;  The [[Cango Caves]] in the Swartberg Mountains are named after this Khoisan word.

The Little Karoo, and especially Oudtshoorn, became synonymous with the ostrich-feather industry in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt;&lt;ref name=road /&gt; The resulting "feather millionaires" built Victorian "Feather Palaces" all over town, using the red rocks belonging to the Enon Conglomerate, and related Kirkwood Formation, to build them.&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt; These grand red palaces and other buildings in Oudtshoorn can still be admired today.

A railway line was built to connect Calitzdorp and Oudtshoorn, to Willowmore and from there, via Klipplaat, to [[Port Elizabeth]], from where the ostrich feathers from the Little Karoo’s ostrich farms could be exported to Europe. That line is no longer in use today.

The Swartberg Pass was built, with convict labor, between 1881 and 1888 by [[Thomas Charles John Bain|Thomas Bain]], son of the famous [[Andrew Geddes Bain]], who built [[Bain's Kloof Pass]] and many others in the Western Cape. The main motivation for building the pass was to provide an all-weather road connection between the southern Great Karoo, and Oudtshoorn (and from there to the sea).&lt;ref name=Readers /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulpin /&gt; The two alternative roads, through the [[N12 road (South Africa)|Meiringspoort]] and the Seweweekspoort defiles, were subject to periodic flooding, after heavy thunderstorms in the Great Karoo. The Swartberg Pass is not tarred and can be treacherously slippery after rain. It also becomes impassable after heavy snowfalls on the mountain, a not infrequent occurrence in winter.

==Karoo in literature==
Poet [[Thomas Hardy]] wrote of the Karoo in his poem "Drummer Hodge".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-dead-drummer/ The Dead Drummer]&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Bridge-Guard in the Karroo", [[Rudyard Kipling]] evoked the loneliness experienced by [[blockhouse]] soldiers at Ketting station on the [[Dwyka River]] while guarding the Karoo railway track, a lifeline during the [[Second Boer War|South African War]] (excerpts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hamer| first = Mary | title = "Bridge-Guard in the Karroo": Notes | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.kipling.org.uk/rg_bridgeguard1.htm | doi = | accessdate = 22 April 2012 }} The poem was first published in [[The Times]] of 5 June 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kertši väin.jpg|thumb|280px|Kerch Strait. View of the port in  Crimea]] 
The '''Kerch Strait''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Керченский пролив}}, {{lang-uk|Керченська протока}}, {{lang-crh|Keriç boğazı}}) is a [[strait]] connecting the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Sea of Azov]], separating the [[Kerch Peninsula]] of [[Crimea]] in the west from the [[Taman Peninsula]] of [[Russia]]'s [[Krasnodar Krai]] in the east. The strait is {{convert|3.1|km|mi}} to {{convert|15|km|mi}} wide and up to {{convert|18|m|ft}} deep.

The most important harbor, the Crimean city of [[Kerch]], gives its name to the strait, formerly known as the [[Cimmerians|Cimmerian]] [[Bosporus]]. The Krasnodar Krai side of the strait contains the [[Taman Bay]] encircled by [[Tuzla Island]] and the 2003 Russian-built {{convert|3.8|km|mi}}-long dam to the south and [[Chushka Spit]] to the north. Russia had started the construction of a major cargo port near [[Taman, Russia|Taman]], the most important Russian settlement on the strait.

==History==
[[Image:Map of Colchis, Iberia, Albania, and the neighbouring countries ca 1770.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The "Cimmerian Bosphorus" of antiquity, shown on a map printed in [[London]], {{circa|lk=no|1770}}.]]
{{See also|Bosporan Kingdom}}

The straits are about {{convert|35|km|sp=us}} long and are {{convert|3.1|km|sp=us}} wide at the narrowest and separate an eastern extension of [[Crimea]] from [[Taman Peninsula|Taman]], the westernmost extension of the [[Caucasus Mountains]]. In [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], there seem to have been a group of islands intersected by arms of the [[Kuban River]] (''Hypanis'') and various [[sound (geography)|sounds]] which have since silted up.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bosporus Cimmerius|volume=4|pages=286-287|first=Ellis|last=Minns|authorlink=Ellis Minns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans knew the strait as the '''Cimmerian Bosporus''' (''{{lang|la|Cimmerianus Bosporus}}'') from its Greek name, the '''Cimmerian Strait''' ({{lang|grc|Κιμμέριος Βόσπορος}}, ''Kimmérios Bosporos''), which honored the [[Cimmerians]], nearby [[steppe]] [[equestrian nomads|nomads]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/books?id=hJEWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA350 Anthon, Charles (1872) "Cimmerii" ''A Classical Dictionary: Containing an Account of the Principal Proper Names Mentioned in Ancient Authors'' (4th ed.) p. 349-350].&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient times the low-lying land near the Strait was known as the [[Maeotic Swamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Hun |title=Hun |website=Everything2.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maravot.com/Etruscan_Phrases_e.html |title=Etruscan_Phrases, research providing new insight into Indo-European languages |website=Maravot.com |date=2009-02-13 |accessdate=2016-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], the Kerch Peninsula became the scene of much desperate combat between forces of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Germany]]. Fighting frequency intensified in the coldest months of year when the strait froze over, allowing the movement of troops over the ice.&lt;ref&gt;Command Magazine, ''Hitler's Army: The Evolution and Structure of German Forces'', [[Da Capo Press]] (2003), {{ISBN|0-306-81260-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-306-81260-6}}, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] stabilized in early 1943, [[Hitler]] ordered the construction of a {{convert|4.8|km|mi|adj=on}} road-and-rail bridge across the Strait of Kerch in the spring of 1943 to support his desire for a renewed offensive to the Caucasus. The cable railway ([[aerial tramway]]), which went into operation on 14 June 1943 with a daily capacity of one thousand tons, was only adequate for the defensive needs of the [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|Seventeenth Army]] in the [[Kuban bridgehead]]. Because of frequent [[earth tremor]]s, this bridge would have required vast quantities of extra-strength [[steel girders]], and their transport would have curtailed shipments of military material to the Crimea. The bridge was never completed, and the [[Wehrmacht]] finished evacuating the Kuban bridgehead in September 1943.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'' by [[Albert Speer]], Chapter 19, pg. 270 (1969, English translation 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 the Soviets built a "provisional" railway bridge ({{Interlanguage link|Kerch railroad bridge|ru|Керченский железнодорожный мост|WD=}}) across the strait. Construction made use of supplies captured from the Germans. The bridge went into operation in November 1944, but moving ice floes destroyed it in February 1945; reconstruction was not attempted.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A territorial dispute between Russia and Ukraine in 2003 centred on [[Tuzla Island]] in the Strait of Kerch. Ukraine and Russia agreed to treat the strait and the Azov Sea as shared internal waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecolex.org/details/treaty/agreement-between-the-russian-federation-and-the-ukraine-on-cooperation-in-the-use-of-the-sea-of-azov-and-the-strait-of-kerch-tre-149547/|title=Agreement between the Russian Federation and the Ukraine on cooperation in the use of the sea of Azov and the strait of Kerch|website=www.ecolex.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storm of November 2007===
On Sunday 11 November 2007 news agencies reported a very strong storm on the [[Black Sea]]. Four ships sank, six ran aground on a sandbank, and two tankers were damaged, resulting in a major oil spill and the death of 23 sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://fr.rian.ru/russia/20071128/89927827.html Marée noire: plus de 33.000 t de déchets pétroliers ramassés sur les plages du détroit de Kertch, 28 November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian-flagged [[oil tanker]] ''Volgoneft-139'' encountered trouble in the Kerch Strait where it sought shelter from the above storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Chris Baldwin | title=Russia Tries to Contain Oil Spill, Save Seamen | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL12303712 | work=Reuters | date=12 November 2007 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the storm the tanker split in half, releasing more than 2000 [[tonne]]s of fuel oil. Four other boats sank in the storm, resulting in the release of sulphur cargo. The storm hampered efforts to rescue crew members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Fuel spill disaster reported in waters near Russia | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/11/11/russia.spill/index.html | work=CNN | date=11 November 2007 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
Another victim of the storm, the Russian cargo ship ''Volnogorsk'', loaded with sulfur, sank at [[Port Kavkaz]] on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenta.ru/news/2007/11/11/second/ В порту "Кавказ" затонул сухогруз c серой], [[lenta.ru]] (11 November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Strait of Kerch.jpg|thumb|Kerch Strait. View from the Crimean coast]]

==Ferry and bridge transportation==
{{main|Kerch Strait ferry line|Crimean Bridge{{!}}Kerch Strait bridge}}

After the war, ferry transportation across the strait was established in 1952, connecting [[Crimea]] and the [[Krasnodar Krai]] ([[Port Krym]] – [[Port Kavkaz]] line). Originally there were four [[train ferry]] ships; later three car-ferry ships were added. Train transportation continued for almost 40 years. The aging train-ferries became obsolete in the late 1980s and were removed from service. In the autumn of 2004, new ships were delivered as replacements and train transportation was re-established.

Moscow mayor [[Yuri Luzhkov]] campaigned for a highway bridge to be constructed across the strait. Since 1944, various bridge projects to span the strait have been proposed or attempted, always hampered by the difficult geologic and geographic configuration of the area. Construction of an approach was actually started in 2003 with the {{convert|3.8|km|mi}}-long dam, provoking the 2003 [[Tuzla Island]] conflict.&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[2014 Russian annexation of Crimea]] the government of Russia decided to build a bridge across the Kerch Strait. The 19-kilometre [[Crimean Bridge]] opened to road traffic in May 2018 and the rail section is expected to be operational in 2019.

Russian state-backed media claims that construction of the bridge caused increases in nutrients and planktons in the waters, attracting large numbers of fish and more than 1,000 of endangered Black Sea [[bottlenose dolphin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman E.. 2017. [http://rbth.com/politics_and_society/2017/02/28/crimean-bridge-construction-boosts-dolphin-population-in-kerch-strait_711003 Crimean bridge construction boosts dolphin population in Kerch Strait]. The [[Russia Beyond the Headlines]]. Retrieved on March 10, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ukraine claims that the acoustic noise and pollution from both the bridge construction and military exercises may actually be killing Black Sea dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uawire.org/news/ukrainian-scientist-dolphins-in-the-crimea-are-dying-because-of-the-construction-of-the-kerch-strait-bridge-and-military-exercises|title=Ukrainian scientist: Dolphins in the Black Sea are dying because of the construction of the Kerch Strait bridge and military exercises|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kerch–Yenikale Canal ==
[[Image:Kerch aivazovsky.jpg|thumb|View across the strait in 1839, by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]]]]
{{main|Kerch–Yenikale Canal}}

In order to improve navigational capabilities of the Strait of Kerch, which is quite shallow in its narrowest point, the [[Kerch–Yenikale Canal]] was dredged through the strait. The [[canal]] can accommodate vessels up to 215 meters long with a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of up to 8 meters with a compulsory [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] assistance.

==Fishing==
Several fish-processing plants are located on the Crimean coast of the strait. The fishing season begins in late autumn and lasts for 2 to 3 months, when many [[seiner]]s put out into the strait to fish. The [[Taman Bay]] is a major fishing ground, with many fishing villages scattered along the coast.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23568">{{Contains Tangut text}}
This '''list of Tangut books''' comprises a list of manuscript and [[xylograph]] texts that are written in the extinct [[Tangut language]] and [[Tangut script]].  These texts were mostly produced within the [[Western Xia]] state (1038–1227) during the 12th and 13th centuries, and include Buddhist sutras and explanatory texts, dictionaries and other philological texts, as well as translations of Chinese books and some original Tangut texts.  Some Tangut texts, particularly Buddhist sutras, continued to be produced during the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368), after the fall of the Western Xia state, but the Tangut language became extinct sometime during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644), and Tangut literature was only rediscovered in the early 20th century.

Most of the books listed here were discovered hidden in a [[stupa]] outside the city walls of the abandoned Western Xia fortress city of [[Khara-Khoto]] in [[Gansu]] by [[Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov]] during his expedition of 1907–1909.  A lesser number of texts (mostly fragments) were recovered from Khara-Khoto by [[Aurel Stein]] during his expedition of 1913–1916. A large number of complete and fragmentary Tangut texts have also been discovered at various sites in [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Ningxia]] and [[Gansu]] in China during the 20th and 21st centuries.

==Buddhist texts==
A very large number of Buddhist texts have been preserved. [[Yevgeny Kychanov]]'s 1999 catalogue of Buddhist texts from Khara-Khoto held at the [[Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] lists 768 entries which cover 370 separate titles.

{{refimprove|date=May 2008}}

This is a list of islands and other locations in the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' film series.

==Davy Jones' Locker==
{{main|Davy Jones' Locker}}
'''[[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]' Locker''' is a fictional place featured prominently in ''At World's End''. It is based on a [[Davy Jones' Locker|real superstition]] of the same name. The arid plain where the ''Pearl'' is beached was filmed at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in Utah. The shore where the ''Pearl'' reenters the ocean was filmed at the [[Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes]] in California.&lt;ref name=Film3Locations /&gt;

The Locker is similar to [[purgatory]], and is the destination for souls that die at sea. Davy Jones was entrusted with the task of ferrying the souls of the deceased into the next world by the goddess Calypso. After Jack Sparrow is killed by the Kraken in ''Dead Man's Chest'', Calypso organizes a mission to rescue his soul from the Locker back to the land of the living.

In the third film, Calypso is accompanied by Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner, and Hector Barbossa, among others. They reach the Locker by the use of magical charts leading to World's End. Sao Feng, one of the nine Pirate Lords, was the previous owner of these charts.

After the crew reach the Locker, they find Jack and the ''Black Pearl'' stranded in the desert. Jack, unable to move the ship, has begun to hallucinate. The ship is transported to the ocean by many crabs under the control of Calypso. While on the ocean, the crew see the ghost of Governor Weatherby Swann, who has been murdered on the orders of Cutler Beckett.

By deciphering the clues on Sao Feng's charts, Jack discovers the way to escape the Locker. At sunset, the crew capsizes the ship; this triggers a [[green flash]] and returns the ''Pearl'' to the world of the living, effectively reviving Jack.

== Isla Cruces ==

'''Isla Cruces''' is a fictional island. The ruined church, graveyard, and mill were filmed in [[Vieille Case]], [[Dominica]]. The beach where Norrington, Sparrow, and Turner duel was filmed near [[Exuma|Little Exuma]] in [[The Bahamas]].&lt;ref name=Film2Locations /&gt;

In ''Dead Man's Chest'', Isla Cruces is a tropical island where [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] buried the Dead Man's Chest. This chest contains his beating heart; stabbing the heart is the only way to kill Jones. The island appears to have been abandoned. The previous occupants are unknown, but there are crumbling buildings indicating that it was once inhabited.

On the island, Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and James Norrington duel for control of the chest. James Norrington escapes with the chest, and gives it to Cutler Beckett in exchange for a full pardon.

It is not revealed in the film why Davy Jones buried the Dead Man's Chest on Isla Cruces. However, the film's writers, [[Ted Elliott (screenwriter)|Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]], imply in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' DVD audio commentary, that Jones chose it because it is a plague island that remains deserted.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Isla de Muerta ==
'''Isla de Muerta''' ("Island of Death") is an island featured in ''The Curse of the Black Pearl''.  It is a mysterious land where the ''[[Black Pearl]]''{{'}}s [[piracy|pirate]] crew hide their looted [[treasure]]. It is the location of the [[Aztec]] treasure that has cursed Hector Barbossa and the other members of his crew.

According to Jack Sparrow, Isla de Muerta is an island that [[phantom island|cannot be found]], except by those who already know where it is hidden. From the air, the island resembles a human skull. Mysteriously shrouded in fog, the isle is surrounded by a graveyard of sunken ships; its waters swarm with [[hammerhead shark]]s and [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling fish]]. The island contains a series of connected caves, which contain the crew's loot and the Chest of Cortes.

Before the events of the film, Hector Barbossa leads a mutiny against Jack Sparrow and becomes the captain of ''Black Pearl''. Later, the crew finds cursed Aztec treasure on Isla de Muerta. By removing the golden medallions from their chest, the crew become undead and lose the ability to feel physical pleasure. In order to remove the curse, the crew collect the medallions and return them.

Barbossa, believing that Elizabeth Swann is the key to breaking his curse, kidnaps her and brings her to Isla de Muerta. Captain Sparrow uses his magical compass, which points to the thing the user wants most, to follow him. With the help of Will Turner, Elizabeth, and Jack fight against the pirates in the caves under the island. James Norrington and his men fight against Barbossa's crew in the bay just offshore. By using Will's blood, the curse is broken and Jack kills Barbossa.

In ''Dead Man's Chest'', it's learned that the island was reclaimed by the sea, taking with it both the cursed Aztec treasure and the mountains of gold that Barbossa's crew had hoarded while they were cursed. It was with this gold that Jack Sparrow had agreed to pay his new crew.

== Pelegosto ==

'''Pelegosto''', also known as '''Cannibal Island''', is a fictional island. Scenes set on the island were filmed on [[Dominica]]. The Pelegosto tribe's main village was built south of the island's capital, [[Roseau]]. Other scenes were filmed in [[Morne Trois Pitons National Park]] and [[Indian River (Dominica)|Indian River]].&lt;ref name=Film2Locations&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/p/PiratesOfCaribbean_2.html#.WNmnExiZPos|title=Film locations for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|publisher=The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations|accessdate=31 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Dead Man's Chest'', [[Bootstrap Bill Turner]], acting as [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]'s agent, delivers the [[Black Spot (Treasure Island)|Black Spot]] to Captain [[Jack Sparrow]], a mark indicating that his blood debt to Jones is due. To avoid the monstrous [[Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]] that is hunting him, Jack commands the crew of the ''Black Pearl'' to land as fast as possible. They alight on Pelegosto, a typical Caribbean island with sandy beaches and lush, mountainous jungles. But it is hardly the paradise it appears to be; it is inhabited by a vicious cannibal tribe that captures the ''Pearl's'' crew. They believe Jack Sparrow is a god in human form and intend to eat him to "release him from his fleshy prison". Will Turner arrives and helps them escape.
 
Jack seeks out [[Tia Dalma]], an [[obeah]] woman, for help. Dalma lives in shack on the other side of the island. He trades Barbossa's undead monkey for a jar of dirt, which she claims will protect him from Davy Jones. After Jack's death at the hands of the Kraken, his crew return to Tia Dalma's shack on Pelegosto. Tia Dalma reveals that she has resurrected Barbossa, and they will lead a mission to rescue Jack from Davy Jones's Locker.

== Port Royal ==
'''Port Royal''' is a British colony. It is based on the historical [[Port Royal]], a city located at the end of the [[Palisadoes]] at the mouth of the [[Kingston Harbour]], in southeastern [[Jamaica]].

Scenes set in the harbor of Port Royal were filmed at Wallilabou Bay, [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]. A replica of [[Fort Charles (Jamaica)|Fort Charles]] was built on the [[Palos Verdes Peninsula]] near [[Los Angeles]], as was Governor Swann's mansion. The scenes set inside the mansion were filmed in [[Manhattan Beach, California]].&lt;ref name="Film1Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/p/PiratesOfCaribbean_1.html#.WNbUGRiZOSM|title=Film locations for Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl|date=2 Aug 2015|accessdate=25 Mar 2017|publisher=The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Port Royal appears in all movies except in [[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|''On Stranger Tides'']].

Elizabeth Swann arrives in Port Royal as a child, after her father Weatherby Swann is appointed governor. In the first film, Will Turner works in the town as a blacksmith's apprentice. Port Royal is attacked by the crew of the ''Black Pearl'' after Elizabeth accidentally summons the pirates. Pintel and Ragetti kidnap Elizabeth from her mansion, which is located in the town. Jack is imprisoned in the jail there, but Will Turner helps him escape.

In ''Dead Man's Chest'', Cutler Beckett uses Port Royal as his base of operations.

==Rum-runner's Isle==
The scenes on '''Rum-runner's Isle''' were filmed in Petit Tabac, one of five islands known as the [[Tobago Cays]], in [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]].&lt;ref name=Film1Guide /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discoversvg.com/index.php/en/component/content/article/41-general/18-pirates|title=Pirates of the Caribbean|publisher=St. Vincent and the Grenadines Tourism Authority|accessdate=25 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the events of the first film, Barbossa leads a mutiny against Jack and strands him on a small island. He leaves Jack a pistol holding a single shot; he could use this to commit [[suicide]] before starving to death. For many years, Barbossa assumes that Jack has died; he is surprised to learn of his survival during the events of the first film. Jack repeatedly claims that he used a raft made of sea turtles and his own back hair to escape the island. In reality, the island was a haven for [[Rum-running|rum-runners]]. Jack discovers their stash of liquor, lies on a beach drinking rum for three days, and barters passage off the isle when the bootleggers return.

During ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'', Barbossa captures Elizabeth and Jack. Will Turner barters for their safety. Barbossa uses a loophole in their agreement to maroon Elizabeth and Jack on the same island. Elizabeth burns the stash of rum in order to create a signal fire, and they are rescued by James Norrington.

==Shipwreck Cove==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Shipwreck Cove]] --&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Shipwreckcitymovie.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Shipwreck Island]] --&gt;

'''Shipwreck Cove''' is an inlet on the fictional Shipwreck Island, appearing in ''At World's End''. Shipwreck Cove is considered to be an impregnable fortress, well-supplied, and able to withstand nearly any siege. It serves as the meeting place for the Brethren Court, which is a gathering of the world's nine Pirate Lords.

Scenes set on Shipwreck Island were filmed in Dominica.&lt;ref name=Film3Locations /&gt;

The Fourth Brethren Court meet to discuss the threat of the East India Trading Company and the ways in which to combat this threat. Barbossa insists that the Court must free Calypso, a sea goddess who was trapped in human form by the first Brethren Court. Sparrow and Elizabeth prefer to fight directly against the EITC. Elizabeth is elected Pirate King by the Court, and she declares war on Cutler Beckett.

The Pirate's Code is kept at Shipwreck Cove. This rulebook serves as the source of law for all pirates. Jack Sparrow's father, Captain Teague, is the Keeper of the Code.

==Singapore==
The fictionalised Singapore is filled with bridge-covered waterways and crude wooden buildings, and differs markedly from the actual historical [[Singapore]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The sets for the bathhouse, harbor, and stilt houses were constructed at Universal Studios in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=Film3Locations&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/p/PiratesOfCaribbean_3.html#.WN6dYRiZPaY|title=Film locations for Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|publisher=The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations|accessdate=31 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears in ''At World's End''. [[Hector Barbossa]] and [[Elizabeth Swann]] visit [[Sao Feng]] to steal his navigational charts, which lead to World's End. They request a ship and a crew to rescue [[Jack Sparrow]] from Davy Jones’s Locker. Sao Feng has captured [[Will Turner]], who attempted to steal the charts from Feng. After a tense standoff, the pirates form a temporary alliance when they are attacked by Ian Mercer and the East India Trading Company. After a series of skirmishes and negotiations, Feng grants them a ship and a crew.

== Tortuga ==
'''[[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]]''' is an [[island]] off the northern coast of [[Saint-Domingue]] ([[Haiti]]), out of the jurisdiction of the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Trading Company]]. While it remains a [[free port]] where traders can escape the high East India tariffs, it is a dangerous one where illegal transactions are common.

Scenes set in Tortuga were filmed in [[Wallilabou Bay]], St. Vincent and the Grenadines.&lt;ref name=Film3Locations /&gt;

In the first film, [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]] and [[Will Turner]] moor their stolen ship, the ''Interceptor'', in Tortuga to recruit a crew. Their crew included [[Joshamee Gibbs]], [[Anamaria]], [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Cotton|Cotton]], and [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Marty|Marty]]. Here, Jack Sparrow also encounters Giselle and Scarlett, with whom has he had past romantic relationships.

In ''Dead Man's Chest'', Will goes to Tortuga to hunt for Jack Sparrow. A denizen tells Will that he saw a ship with black sails (the ''[[Black Pearl]]'') beached on Pelegosto. Jack returns to Tortuga to try to enlist ninety-nine unsuspecting sailors to pay off his blood debt to [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]. Although he falls far short of his goal, the new crew proves useful during the final confrontation with the [[Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]]. Jack is reunited with [[Elizabeth Swann]] while in Tortuga and also recruits the disgraced [[James Norrington]], who resigned his commission after losing his ship in a hurricane.

At the conclusion of ''At World's End'', Barbossa leaves Jack and Gibbs in Tortuga by once again hijacking the ''Black Pearl.'' Gibbs remains in Tortuga with Giselle and Scarlett.

At the end of ''On Stranger Tides'', Barbossa is in command of Blackbeard's ship, the ''Queen Anne's Revenge''. He yells out that they will travel back to Tortuga, although this is not shown onscreen.

[[Image:Flag of March of Ancona.gif|right|thumb|200px|The papal standard of Ancona.]]
The '''March of Ancona''' ({{Lang-it|Marca Anconitana}}) (also '''Anconetana''') was a [[March (territorial entity)|frontier march]] centred on the city of [[Ancona]] and, then, [[Macerata]]&lt;!--not Ancona!!--&gt; in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pPJPhOnv7lwC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;dq=march+on+ancona&amp;source=web&amp;ots=qlaPvTZEkM&amp;sig=opHbLncnjGpV8DMifHioBSrobyA Biondo Flavio (1559) ''Italy Illuminated'', ed. Jeffrey A. White]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its name is preserved as an Italian region today, the [[Marche]]s, and it corresponds to almost the entire modern region and not just the [[Province of Ancona]].

The march was created as a political division of the [[Papal States]] during the pontificate of [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] in the year 1198. It was initially governed by a papal nominee called a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]. The rector of Ancona, like the rectors of the other papal provinces, was under the authority of a general rector reporting directly to the pope. The province was confirmed by the ''[[Constitutiones Sanctæ Matris Ecclesiæ]]'' in 1357. The march followed the [[Adriatic]] as far north as [[Urbino]] and contained the cities of [[Loreto (AN)|Loreto]], [[Camerino]], [[Fermo]], [[Macerata]], [[Osimo]], [[San Severino Marche|San Severino]], and [[Tolentino]]

According to [[Paul Sabatier (theologian)|Paul Sabatier's]] biography of [[St. Francis of Assisi]], "The Road to Assisi", the March of Ancona became the home of the [[spiritual Franciscans]] after Francis' death.

''Introduction to African Civilizations'', 2001. Page 201.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the source of the name "Guinea" (via French ''Guinoye'') used to refer to the West African coast (as in [[Gulf of Guinea]]). Ghana was inhabited in pre-colonial times by a number of ancient predominantly [[Akan people|Akan]] kingdoms, including the inland [[Empire of Ashanti]] and various [[Fante people|Fante]] states along the coast and inland. Trade with European states flourished after contact with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in the 15th century, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] established a [[crown colony]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], in 1874.&lt;ref name="colestablish"&gt;MacLean, Iain.

In the [[Akan language]] it is spelled ''Gaana''.

'''Ozone Falls''' is a waterfall located in  [[Cumberland County, Tennessee]] in the [[Ozone Falls State Natural Area]] and [[Justin P. Wilson Cumberland Trail State Park | Cumberland Trail State Park]]. Ozone Falls is situated along Fall Creek, which drains a short section of the [[Cumberland Plateau]] between the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]] to the west and [[Walden Ridge]] to the east. The creek flows down from its source high in the Crab Orchard Mountains for a mile or so before steadying briefly as it enters the community of [[Ozone, Tennessee|Ozone]]. Fall Creek enters the state natural area just after it passes under [[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 70]], which runs perpendicular to it. The creek spills over Ozone Falls a few hundred meters south of US-70.  The trailhead is located along US-70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roark|first=Kelley|title=Hiking Tennessee|year=1996|publisher=Falcon|location=Helena, Mont.|isbn=978-1-56044-394-0|pages=158–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pamir Mountains''' are a [[mountain range]] in [[Central Asia]], at the junction of the [[Himalayas]] with the [[Tian Shan]], [[Karakoram]], [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]], [[Hindu Kush]], [[Suleman Mountain|Suleman]] and [[Hindu Raj]] ranges. They are among the world’s highest [[mountain]]s.

The Pamir Mountains lie mostly in the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province|Gorno-Badakhshan]] province of [[Tajikistan]].&lt;ref&gt;According to the [http://bse.sci-lib.com/article086489.html ''Big Soviet Encyclopedia'']  "The question of the natural boundaries of Pamir is debatable. Normally Pamir is regarded as covering the territory from Trans-Alay Range to the north, Sarykol Range to the east, Lake Zorkul, Pamir River, and the upper reaches of Panj River to the south, and the meridional section of the Panj valley to the west; to the north-west Pamir includes the eastern parts of Peter the Great and Darvaz ranges."&lt;/ref&gt; To the north, they join the Tian Shan mountains along the [[Alay Valley]] of [[Kyrgyzstan]]. To the south, they border the Hindu Kush mountains along [[Afghanistan]]'s [[Wakhan Corridor]]. To the east, they extend to the range that includes [[China]]'s [[Kongur Tagh]], in the "Eastern Pamirs",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title= High cooling and denudation rates at Kongur Shan, Eastern Pamir (Xinjiang, China)

== Name and etymology ==
Since Victorian times, they have been known as the "[[Roof of the World]]", presumably a translation from [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/PAI_PAS/PAMIRS.html Encyclopædia Britannica 11th ed. 1911]: PAMIRS, a mountainous region of central
Asia...the Bam-i-dunya ("The Roof of the World"); ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 1942 ed., p.1335: "Pamir (Persian = roof of the world)"; [http://www.pamirs.org/ The Pamirs], a region known to the locals as Pomir&amp;nbsp;– “the roof of the world".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IEyTC-_VtAQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA14,M1 ''Social and Economic Change in the Pamirs'', pp. 13–14], by Frank Bliss, Routledge, 2005, {{ISBN|0-415-30806-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-30806-9}}: Pamir = a Persian compilation of ''pay-I-mehr'', the "roof of the world".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Names ===
In other languages they are called: [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] Памир тоолору, ''Pamir Tooloru'', پامىر توولورۇ; {{lang-fa|رشته کوه های  پامیر|Rešte Kuhhā-ye Pāmir}}; {{lang-tg|Ришта Кӯҳҳои Помир|Rishta Köhhoyi Pomir}}; {{lang-ps|د پامير غرونه|Da Pāmir Ğruna}} (or {{lang|ps|د پامیر د غرونو لړۍ)}}; [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: پامىر ئېگىزلىكى, Памир Езгизлики, ''Pamir Ëzgizliki''; [[Sanskrit]]: ''Sumeru''; {{lang-ur|{{nq|پامیر کوهستان}}}} ''Pamir Kuhestan''; {{zh|s=葱岭|t=蔥嶺|p=Cōnglǐng|w=Ts'ung-ling}} or "Onion Range" (after the wild onions growing in the region);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=水經注 |wslink=水經注/02 |trans_title= [[Commentary on the Water Classic]] |volume=2 |last=Li |first=Daoyuan |authorlink=Li Daoyuan |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |scan= |wslanguage=zh |quote=蔥嶺在敦煌西八千里，其山高大，上生蔥，故曰蔥嶺也。(quoting from the [[Xi He Jiu Shi|西河舊事]]) The Onion Range is 8,000 [[Li (unit)|Li]] west of [[Dunhuang]]in Uzbek Language "Pamir Tog'i".

The name "Pamir" is used more commonly in Modern Chinese and loaned as {{zh|s=帕米尔|t=帕米爾|p=Pàmǐ'ěr}}.

=== "A pamir" ===
According to Middleton and Thomas, "pamir" is a [[geology|geological]] term.&lt;ref name=middleton/&gt;  A pamir is a flat plateau or U-shaped valley surrounded by mountains. It forms when a glacier or ice field melts leaving a rocky plain. A pamir lasts until erosion forms soil and cuts down normal valleys. This type of terrain is found in the east and north of the [[Wakhan]],&lt;ref name="akdn3"&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/publications/2010_akf_wakhan.pdf Aga Khan Development Network (2010): ''Wakhan and the Afghan Pamir'' p.3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123124819/http://www.akdn.org/publications/2010_akf_wakhan.pdf |date=2011-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the east and south of Gorno-Badakhshan, as opposed to the valleys and gorges of the west. Pamirs are used for summer pasture.&lt;ref name=middleton/&gt;&lt;ref name=akdn3/&gt;

The [[Great Pamir]] is around Lake [[Zorkul]]. The [[Little Pamir]] is east of this in the far east of Wakhan.&lt;ref name=akdn3/&gt; The [[Taghdumbash Pamir]] is between [[Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County|Tashkurgan]] and the [[Wakhan]] west of the [[Karakoram Highway]]. The [[Alichur Pamir]] is around [[Yashil Kul]] on the [[Gunt River]]. The [[Sarez Pamir]] is around the town of [[Murghab, Tajikistan|Murghab]]. The [[Khargush Pamir]] is south of Lake [[Karakul (Tajikistan)|Karakul]]. There are several others.

The [[Pamir River]] is in the south-west of the Pamirs.

=== Mountains ===
The three highest mountains in the Pamirs core are [[Ismoil Somoni Peak]] (known from 1932–1962 as Stalin Peak, and from 1962–1998 as Communism Peak), {{convert|7495|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; [[Ibn Sina Peak]] (still unofficially known as Lenin Peak), {{convert|7134|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; and [[Peak Korzhenevskaya]] ({{lang-ru|Пик Корженевской}}, ''Pik Korzhenevskoi''), {{convert|7105|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Tajikistan: 15 Years of Independence'', statistical yearbook, Dushanbe, 2006, p. 8, in Russian.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Eastern Pamirs, China's [[Kongur Tagh]] is the highest at {{convert|7649|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

Among the significant peaks of the Pamir Mountains are the following:&lt;ref&gt;Heights of mountains over 6,750 metres in accordance with:

''Remark'': The summits of the Kongur and Muztagata Group are in some sources counted as part of the [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]], which would make Pik Ismoil Somoni the highest summit of the Pamir.

=== Glaciers ===
There are many [[glacier]]s in the Pamir Mountains, including the {{convert|77|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long [[Fedchenko Glacier]], the longest in the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and the longest glacier outside the [[polar regions]].&lt;ref&gt;In the Karakoram Mountains, [[Siachen Glacier]] is 76 km long, [[Biafo Glacier]] is 67 km long, and [[Baltoro Glacier|Baltoro]] is 63 km long.  The [[Bruggen Glacier|Bruggen or Pio XI Glacier]] in southern Chile is 66 km long.  Kyrgyzstan's [[South Inylchek Glacier|South Inylchek (Enylchek) Glacier]] is 60.5 km in length.  Measurements are from recent imagery, generally with Russian 1:200,000 scale topographic mapping for reference as well as the 1990 ''Orographic Sketch Map: Karakoram:  Sheets 1 and 2'', Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, Zurich.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 12,500&amp;nbsp;km² (ca. 10%)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knoche|first=Malte|last2=Merz|first2=Ralf|last3=Lindner|first3=Martin|last4=Weise|first4=Stephan M.|date=2017-06-13|title=Bridging Glaciological and Hydrological Trends in the Pamir Mountains, Central Asia|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/9/6/422|journal=Water|language=en|volume=9|issue=6|pages=422|doi=10.3390/w9060422}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Pamirs are glaciated. Glaciers in the Southern Pamirs are retreating rapidly. Ten percent of annual runoff is supposed to origin from retreating glaciers in the Southern Pamirs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the North-Western Pamirs, glaciers have almost stable mass balances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Climate ===
[[File:Tajik pamir springtime.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Part of the Pamir Mountain range in springtime]]

Covered in [[snow]] throughout the year, the Pamirs have long and bitterly cold [[winter]]s, and short, cool [[summer]]s. Annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is about {{convert|130|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}, which supports [[grassland]]s but few [[tree]]s.

==== Paleoclimatology during the Ice Age ====
The East-Pamir, in the centre of which the [[massif]]s of Mustagh Ata (7620 m) and Kongur Tagh (Qungur Shan, 7578, 7628 or 7830 m) are situated, shows from the W-margin of the Tarim Basin an East-West extension of c. 200&amp;nbsp;km. Its North-South extension from King Ata Tagh up to the North-West Kunlun foothills amounts to c.170&amp;nbsp;km. Whilst the up to 21&amp;nbsp;km long current valley glaciers are restricted to mountain massifs exceeding 5600 m in height, during the Last Glacial Period the glacier ice has covered the high plateau with its set-up highland relief, continuing west of Mustagh Ata and Kongur. From this glacier area an outlet glacier has flowed down to the north-east through the Gez valley up to c.1850 m asl and thus as far as to the margin of the Tarim basin. This outlet glacier received inflow from the Kaiayayilak glacier from the Kongur-north-flank. From the north-adjacent Kara Bak Tor (Chakragil, c. 6800 or 6694 m)-massif the Oytag valley glacier in the same exposition flowed also down up to c. 1850 m asl. At glacial times the glacier snowline (ELA) as altitude limit between glacier nourishing area and ablation zone, was lowered about 820 to 1250 altitude metres against today.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhle, M. (1997):''New findings concerning the Ice Age (LGM) glacier cover of the East Pamir, of the Nanga Parbat up to the Central Himalaya and of Tibet, as well as the Age of the Tibetan Inland Ice.'' Tibet and High Asia (IV). Results of Investigations into High Mountain Geomorphology. Paleo-Glaciology and Climatology of the Pleistocene. GeoJournal, 42, (2–3), pp. 87–257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhle, M. (2004):''The High Glacial (Last Ice Age and LGM) glacier cover in High- and Central Asia. Accompanying text to the mapwork in hand with detailed references to the literature of the underlying empirical investigations.'' Ehlers, J., Gibbard, P. L. (Eds.). Extent and Chronology of Glaciations, Vol. 3 (Latin America, Asia, Africa, Australia, Antarctica). Amsterdam, Elsevier B.V., pp. 175–199.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the condition of comparable proportions of precipitation there results from this a glacial depression of temperature of at least 5 to 7.5&amp;nbsp;°C.

== Economy ==
[[Coal]] is mined in the west, though [[sheep]] herding in upper [[Montane grasslands and shrublands|meadowlands]] are the primary source of income for the region.

== Exploration ==
:''This section is based on the book by R. Middleton and H. Thomas''&lt;ref name=middleton&gt;Robert Middleton and Huw Thomas, 'Tajikistan and the High Pamirs',Odyssey Books, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1982 expedition to Tartu Ülikool 350 (39).jpg|thumb|left|Expedition in 1982 to [[Tartu Ülikool 350]] Peak, which was considered to be the highest unreached peak in the territory of former Soviet Union at the time]]

The [[lapis lazuli]] found in Egyptian tombs is thought to come from the Pamir area in Badakhshan province of Afghanistan. About 138 BC [[Zhang Qian]] reached the [[Fergana Valley]] northwest of the Pamirs. [[Ptolemy]] vaguely describes a trade route through the area. From about 600 AD, Buddhist pilgrims travelled on both sides of the Pamirs to reach India from China.  In 747 a Tang army was on the Wakhan River.  There are various Arab and Chinese reports. [[Marco Polo]] may have travelled along the [[Panj River]].  In 1602 [[Bento de Goes]] travelled from [[Kabul]] to [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] and left a meager report on the Pamirs. In 1838 Lieutenant [[John Wood (explorer)|John Wood]] reached the headwaters of the [[Pamir River]]. From about 1868 to 1880, a number of Indians in the British service secretly explored the Panj area. In 1873 the British and Russians agreed to an Afghan frontier along the Panj River. From 1871 to around 1893 several Russian military-scientific expeditions mapped out most of the Pamirs ([[Alexei Pavlovich Fedchenko]], [[Nikolai Severtzov]], Captain [[Putyata]] and others. Later came [[Nikolai Korzhenevskiy]]).  Several local groups asked for Russian protection from Afghan raiders.  The Russians were followed by a number of non-Russians including [[Ney Elias]], [[George Littledale]], [[Charles Murray, 7th Earl of Dunmore|the Earl of Dunmore]], [[Wilhelm Filchner]] and [[Lord Curzon]] who was probably the first to reach the Wakhan source of the [[Oxus River]]. In 1891 the Russians informed [[Francis Younghusband]] that he was on their territory and later escorted a Lieutenant Davidson out of the area ('Pamir Incident'). In 1892 a battalion of Russians under Mikhail Ionov entered the area and camped near the present [[Murghab District|Murghab]]. In 1893 they built a proper fort there (''Pamirskiy Post'').  In 1895 their base was moved to [[Khorugh|Khorog]] facing the Afghans.

In 1928 the last blank areas around the [[Fedchenko Glacier]] were mapped out by a German-Soviet expedition under Willi Rickmer Rickmers.

== Discoveries ==
[[File:Pamir World Wind.jpg|thumb|Pamir Mountains from a NASA satellite image, April 2012]]
In the early 1980s, a deposit of [[gemstone]]-quality [[clinohumite]] was discovered in the Pamir Mountains. It was the only such deposit known until the discovery of gem-quality material in the [[Taymyr Peninsula|Taymyr]] region of [[Siberia]], in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

== Transport ==
The [[Pamir Highway]], the world's second highest international road, runs from [[Dushanbe]] in [[Tajikistan]] to [[Osh]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]] through the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province]], and is the isolated region's main supply route. The Great [[Silk Road]] crossed a number of Pamir Mountain ranges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Tourism ==
In December 2009, the ''[[New York Times]]'' featured articles on the possibilities for tourism in the Pamir area of Tajikistan.&lt;ref name=nytimes_pamir/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes_crossroads/&gt; 2013 proved to be the most successful year ever for tourism in the region and tourism development continues to be the fastest growing economic sector. The META (Murghab Ecotourism Association) website (www.meta.tj) provides an excellent repository of tourism related resources for the Eastern Pamir region.

Historically, the Pamir Mountains were considered a strategic trade route between [[Kashgar]] and [[Kokand]] on the [[Northern Silk Road]] and have been subject to numerous territorial conquests.  The Northern Silk Road (about {{convert|2600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in length) connected the ancient Chinese capital of [[Xian|Xi'an]] over the Pamir Mountains towards the west to emerge in [[Kashgar]] before linking to ancient [[Parthia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 |title=''Silk Road, North China'', C.Michael Hogan, the Megalithic Portal, ed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2831">The '''Pernambuco fault''' or '''Pernambuco Shear Zone''' in northeastern [[Brazil]] is a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] radiating from the [[Trans Brazilian Lineament]] eastwards to the coast, a major geological feature.&lt;ref name=Fairhead2007/&gt;

The Pernambuco-Alagoas domain, part of the [[Borborema Province]], is primarily made of rocks aged between 1,600 and 1,000 million years, significantly younger than the areas to the north and south.&lt;ref name=Pankhurst2008/&gt;

The Pernambuco fault in this domain is a continuation of the [[Foumban Shear Zone]] in [[Cameroon]], itself the western end of the [[Central African Shear Zone]].&lt;ref name=Fairhead2007/&gt;
To the west, the fault splays into numerous faults along a distance of about 50&amp;nbsp;km, suggesting that the crust was weak at this point, which is on the line where [[South America]] separated from [[Africa]] around 115 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Vauchez1992/&gt;

The '''Plain of Flanders''' (fr: ''Plaine de Flandre'' or ''plaine flamande'') is a low-lying [[plain]] bordering the [[North Sea]]. It is part of the [[Low Countries]], and the [[North European Plain]]. It extends through the territories of Northern [[France]] and [[Belgium]]. It has two main sections : Maritime Flanders and Interior Flanders. The coastal plain consists mainly of [[sand dune]]s and [[polder]]s.

It is a feature of the Flanders Basin (fr: Bassin de Flandre), which is separated from the [[Parisian Basin]] by the Hills of [[Artois]].

''Maritime Flanders'' also refers to the French [[Westhoek (region)|Westhoek region]]. It refers more specifically to the [[Blootland]] (Dutch for "naked land") or the Maritime Plain (French: ''Plaine maritime'') including [[Dunkirk]], [[Bourbourg]], [[Bergues]] and [[Hondschoote]].

'''Public swimming pools in Hong Kong''' are managed by the [[Leisure and Cultural Services Department]] (LCSD). There are 44 public swimming pools in [[Hong Kong]]; 9 in [[Hong Kong Island]], 13 in [[Kowloon]], and 22 in the [[New Territories]]. LCSD manages public swimming pools according to [[Law of Hong Kong]] Chapter 132 sections 42 to 45.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance|url=https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap132|work=Hong Kong e-Legislation|publisher=[[Department of Justice (Hong Kong)|Department of Justice]]|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Victoria Park Swimming Pool 20130907.JPG|thumbnail|The former pool at Victoria Park, the first public swimming venue in Hong Kong.]]
[[File:Lei Cheng Uk swimming pool.jpg|thumbnail|The main pool at [[Lei Cheng Uk Estate|Lei Cheng Uk]] Swimming Pool complex, opened 1971 as one of many funded by the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lei Cheng Uk Swimming Pool, Sham Shui Po|url=http://www.hkmemory.hk/collections/hkplaces/AllItems/images/201107/t20110722_42316.html|work=The Hong Kong Jockey Club Archives|publisher=Hong Kong Memory Project|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===20th century===
[[Victoria Park, Hong Kong|Victoria Park]] Swimming Pool, built and managed by the [[Urban Council (Hong Kong)|Urban Council]] and funded by the [[Hong Kong Jockey Club]], was the first public swimming complex in Hong Kong. The 50 by 20 metre pool was officially unveiled on 16 October 1957 by former Governor [[Alexander Grantham|Sir Alexander Grantham]]. It was highly popular with residents, and served over 360,000 over its first year of operation.&lt;ref name=lcsd1&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Victoria Park Swimming Pool to open for public visits before closure (with photos)|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201308/28/P201308280518.htm|work=Press releases|publisher=HKSAR Government|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spectator stand seated 1,700. This facility operated continuously until 2013, when it was closed and replaced by a new indoor swimming pool (of the same name) on the site adjacent. The old pool will consequently be demolished, sparking some mourning of the loss of a piece of the collective memory of many Hong Kong residents. In response, the LCSD stated they would "explore the possibility" of displaying some items of historical significance, such as the plaque unveiled by Governor Grantham, at the new facility, and planned to make use of "3D laser scanning technology" to record the architecture of the old pool complex.&lt;ref name=lcsd1 /&gt;

[[Kowloon Tsai Swimming Pool]], in [[Kowloon Tsai Park]], opened in 1964 as the first public swimming pool in [[Kowloon]]. The opening of the facility was publicised internationally in a [[Pathé News|British Pathé]] [[newsreel]], which stated a construction cost of £125,000 and highlighted the lack of bathing beaches in the densely populated vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hong Kong's In The Swim|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/hong-kongs-in-the-swim/query/Kowloon|publisher=British Pathé|accessdate=1 May 2014|format=Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first indoor heated public pool, Morrison Hill Swimming Pool in [[Wan Chai]], opened in 1972. While many swimming facilities close in the winter season, the public now has the option of visiting 24 different public heated pools, both indoor and outdoor, which remain open during the colder months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swimming Pools|url=http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/culture/recreation/facilities/sportsrecreation.htm|work=Sports &amp; Recreation in Hong Kong: Past and Present|publisher=HKSAR Government|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many swimming complexes of the 1960s and 1970s were funded, in part or whole, by the [[Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club]]. One of these was the Tsuen Wan Swimming Pool, opened 1975, which was the first public swimming pool in the [[New Territories]]. The name was changed to Kwai Shing Swimming Pool in 1978.&lt;ref name=tw&gt;{{cite web|title=Tsuen Wan Swimming Pool, 1975|url=http://www.hkmemory.hk/collections/hkjc/All_Items/Images/201201/t20120130_48576.html|work=The Hong Kong Jockey Club Archives|publisher=Hong Kong Memory Project|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standardised design of the complex is typical of the era, incorporating two 50-metre pools, changing rooms and lobby located mostly underneath a covered grandstand, and several other smaller teaching pools.

The Pao Yue-Kong Swimming Pool complex, the only public pool in [[Southern District (Hong Kong)|Southern District]], was officially opened on 9 July 1977 by then-Governor Sir [[Murray MacLehose]]. It is named after [[Yue-Kong Pao]], who donated funds toward its establishment.

The Sha Tin Jockey Club Swimming Pool, the largest pool complex in [[Sha Tin District]], opened in April 1981. The Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club funded the $33 million project in its entirety as to commemorate the opening of the nearby [[Sha Tin Racecourse]].&lt;ref name=stjc&gt;{{cite web|title=Sha Tin Jockey Club Public Swimming Pool, 1981|url=http://www.hkmemory.hk/collections/hkjc/All_Items/Images/201201/t20120130_48596.html|work=The Hong Kong Jockey Club Archives|publisher=Hong Kong Memory Project|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the Urban Council announced a policy of building more "fun pools" with special free-form designs and water toys. A councilor explained, "It is felt that these fun pools will provide more fun, excitement and enjoyment for the public who no longer regard swimming as a mere form of exercise." In 1985, four such pools were planned for Kowloon and a fifth for Hong Kong Island.&lt;ref name=standard85&gt;{{cite news|title=Urbco pools fill a summer need|url=http://hknews.lib.hku.hk.eproxy2.lib.hku.hk/newspaper/view/19_09.01/41540.pdf|accessdate=6 October 2014|publisher=Hong Kong Standard|date=7 July 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Regional Council (Hong Kong)|Regional Council]] (RegCo) was founded in 1986. Prior to that date, swimming pools in the New Territories fell under the purview of the Director of Urban Services, as the [[Urban Services Department]], the executive arm of the Urban Council, had been servicing the New Territories since its establishment in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Urban Council of Hong Kong|url=http://hknews.lib.hku.hk.eproxy2.lib.hku.hk/newspaper/view/19_08.01/41268.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2014|publisher=Hong Kong Standard|date=26 October 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation of New Territories swimming pools was subsequently transferred to RegCo, who also built new facilities.

[[Kowloon Park]] Swimming Pool, opened on 12 September 1989, has undergone several upgrades in recent years. It served as the venue for the aquatics events in the [[2009 East Asian Games]], and is today has the highest patronage of all pool complexes in Hong Kong, serving over 2000 swimmers per day.&lt;ref name=govnews&gt;{{cite news|title=Park pool ready for 3rd HK Games|url=http://archive.news.gov.hk/en/categories/health/html/2011/04/20110418_174508.shtml|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=news.gov.hk|date=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
With the dissolution of the [[Urban Council (Hong Kong)|Urban Council]] and [[Regional Council (Hong Kong)|Regional Council]] at the end of the millennium, operations of all public swimming pools were taken up by the newly formed [[Leisure and Cultural Services Department]] (LCSD).

Controversy erupted in 2004 after thousands of bloodworms were found in various public swimming pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheung|first1=Chi-fai|last2=Kwong|first2=Robin|title=Worms breeding, officials admit|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/468840/worms-breeding-officials-admit|accessdate=7 August 2014|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=3 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worms reportedly posed no threat to humans, but LCSD management came under fire for not being forthcoming about the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yeung|first1=Chris|title=How worms nearly wriggled into political monsters|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/469153/how-worms-nearly-wriggled-political-monsters|accessdate=7 August 2014|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=5 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lai|first1=Ying-kit|title=Officials criticised over handling of discovery of bloodworms in swimming pools|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/482278/officials-criticised-over-handling-discovery-bloodworms-swimming-pools|accessdate=7 August 2014|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=16 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "massive cleanup" was undertaken to eliminate the worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wu|first1=Helen|title=Massive clean-up launched at public pools|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/469227/massive-clean-launched-public-pools|accessdate=7 August 2014|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=6 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2004 lifeguard staffing cuts ====
In 2004 the LCSD slashed the lifeguard workforce from around 2,400 to 1,580. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Life Guards’ Union has spoken out against this cut in the years since, stating that it is unsafe and puts unreasonable pressure on the lifeguards. Many swimming pools have protest signage about this issue, which the LCSD has asked the lifeguards to remove.&lt;ref name=cuts&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cheung|first1=Karen|title=Lifeguard union to hold city-wide strike on Sunday – several pools, beaches likely to close|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/07/13/lifeguard-union-to-hold-city-wide-strike-on-sunday-several-pools-beaches-likely-to-close/|work=Hong Kong Free Press|date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lifeguards have gone on strike in 2004, 2005, and 2014.&lt;ref name=cuts/&gt;

==== 2014 lifeguard strike ====
In August 2014, at the height of the summer swimming season, many lifeguards serving Hong Kong's beaches and swimming pools went on strike.  About 400 lifeguards staged a sit-in at the headquarters of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department in Sha Tin.&lt;ref name=scmp/&gt;

Lifesaving staff complained that since lifeguard numbers were cut drastically in 2004 their workload has been too great, with lifeguards having to look after greater numbers of swimmers, and warned that safety had been compromised by the government cutbacks.&lt;ref name=scmp&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lai|first1=Ying-kit|last2=Yap|first2=Brian|last3=Liu|first3=Calvin|title=Lifeguard strike closes beaches, pools|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1567134/lifeguard-strike-closes-beaches-pools|accessdate=6 August 2014|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pools, beaches hit by lifeguard strike|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=52429&amp;icid=3&amp;d_str=|accessdate=6 August 2014|publisher=The Standard|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said the situation has been exacerbated by crowding caused by increasing numbers of mainland tourists at Hong Kong pools and beaches. The vice chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Lifeguards' Union complained, "some of them urinate everywhere and jump into the pool without wearing swim suits, or bring food to the venue. They don't have the same personal hygiene and safety standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong lifeguards strike over influx of swimmers from mainland China|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-05/hong-kong-lifeguards-to-strike-over-china-influx/5650012|accessdate=6 August 2014|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong lifeguards to strike following influx of China swimmers|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/hong-kong-lifeguards-to/1296160.html|accessdate=6 August 2014|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was suggested that the influx of mainland swimmers was a result of poor water quality in mainland Chinese swimming pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ngai|first1=Edward|title=As Chinese Tourists Flock to Hong Kong, Lifeguards Strike Over Crowded Beaches|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/08/05/as-chinese-tourists-flock-to-hong-kong-lifeguards-strike-over-crowded-beaches/|accessdate=6 August 2014|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Shenzhen newspaper, ''Southern Metropolis Daily'', had also published an article highlighting the affordability and good facilities of Hong Kong's pools compared to those in Shenzhen. After the report was published, the number of LCSD pool closures due to contamination of the pool water with vomit or feces reached the highest level in six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wong|first1=Vey|title=New gripe against mainlanders: Crowded swimming pools|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20140804-new-gripe-against-mainlanders-crowded-swimming-pools/|work=Hong Kong Economic Journal|date=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the staff shortage during the strike, some pools were temporarily closed and certain facilities at others, like toddler pools, shut down to divert staff resources.

====New pools====
In recent years the LCSD has replaced several older facilities. The new HK$800 million facility at Victoria Park hosts a 50 by 25 metre main pool, a multi-purpose pool with adjustable depth floor and diving platform, and the largest swimming pool spectator stand in Hong Kong, seating 2,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Victoria Park Swimming Pool to open mid-September (with photos)|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201309/02/P201309020569.htm|work=Press releases|publisher=HKSAR Government|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May 2011 the first phase of the new [[Kennedy Town Swimming Pool]] opened, relocated in order to facilitate [[West Island Line]] construction works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennedy Town Swimming Pool to open for public use|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/ppr_release_det.php?id=3521|work=Press Releases|publisher=Leisure and Cultural Services Department|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1 April 2013, the new Kwun Tong Swimming Pool opened on a site directly adjacent to the old pool complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kwun Tong Swimming Pool to open with a new look (with photos)|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201303/30/P201303280586.htm|work=Press Releases|publisher=HKSAR Government|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several new pools are planned. A new Wan Chai Swimming Pool recently opened to replace an older pool of the same name, which will be demolished to make way for the new [[Exhibition Station (MTR)|Exhibition Station]] of the [[Sha Tin to Central Link]]. Another new pool is planned for [[Tin Shui Wai|Tin Shui Wai North]], as the two existing pools in the new town are very crowded. An indoor swimming pool is under construction beside Cheung Hong Estate in Tsing Yi and is expected to open in 2016-17.

==Monthly ticket scheme==
[[File:HK public swimming pool mothly ticket.jpg|right|thumb|A Public Swimming Pool Monthly Ticket in Hong Kong ($150) with name of holder, valid date and issuing venue.]]

A '''radar altimeter''', '''electronic altimeter''', '''reflection altimeter''', '''radio altimeter''' ('''RADALT'''), '''low range radio altimeter (LRRA)''' or simply '''RA''', used on aircraft, measures [[altitude]] above the [[terrain]] presently beneath an [[aircraft]] or [[spacecraft]] by timing how long it takes a beam of radio waves to reflect from the ground and return to the plane. This type of [[altimeter]] provides the distance between the antenna and the ground directly below it, in contrast to a [[barometric altimeter]] which provides the distance above a defined datum, usually mean sea level.

==ITU definition==
From the legal point of view, a '''radio altimeter''' is – according to ''article 1.108'' of the [[International Telecommunication Union|International Telecommunication Union´s]] (ITU) [[ITU Radio Regulations]] (RR)&lt;ref&gt;ITU Radio Regulations, Section IV. Radio Stations and Systems – Article 1.108, definition: ''radio altimeter''&lt;/ref&gt; – defined as «''Radionavigation equipment, on board an aircraft or spacecraft, used to determine the height of the aircraft or the spacecraft above the Earth's surface or another surface''.» ''Radionavigation equipment'' shall be classified by the ''radiocommunication service'' in which it operates permanently or temporarily. The utilization of radio altimeter equipment is categorised as so-called [[Safety service|safety-of-life service]], must be protected for [[Interference (communication)|Interferences]], and is an essential part of [[Navigation]].
;See also: {{main|Radio station|Radiocommunication service}}

==Principle==
{{main|Radar#Radar signal processing}}

As the name implies, [[radar]] ('''ra'''dio '''d'''etection '''a'''nd '''r'''anging) is the underpinning principle of the system.  The system transmits radio waves down to the ground and measures the time it takes them to be reflected back up to the aircraft.  The altitude above the ground is calculated from the radio waves' travel time and the [[speed of light]].

Radar altimeters normally work in the [[E band (NATO)|E band]], {{Ka band}}, or, for more advanced sea-level measurement, [[S band]].  Radar altimeters also provide a reliable and accurate method of measuring height above water, when flying long sea-tracks.  These are critical for use when operating to and from oil rigs.

== Pulse-limited altimetry ==

Consider a radar pulse emanating from a radar beacon traveling downwards and interacting with a flat ocean surface.  The following figure shows an  illustration of the vertical cross-section and top-down view of the radar pulse (adapted from &lt;ref name=sandwell&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandwell|first=David T.|title=Radar Altimetry|url=http://topex.ucsd.edu/rs/altimetry.pdf|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) .

[[File:Satellite Radar Diagram.jpg|230px|border|Satellite Radar Diagram]]         [[File:Pulse-Limited Radar Ground Footprint.jpg|border|287px|Pulse-Limited Radar Ground Footprint]]

The radar altimeter measures the return power of the radar pulse that's reflected off the land/ocean surface.  The temporal evolution of the reflected radar pulse is interpreted in order to estimate the distance between the radar altimeter and the reflecting surface; surface irregularities can also be estimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radar Altimetry Tutorial: From radar pulse to altimetry measurements|url=http://www.altimetry.info/html/alti/principle/waveform/welcome_en.html|publisher=CNES|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The expected return pulse can be derived from a few basic mathematical considerations.&lt;ref name=sandwell /&gt;

From the previous illustration of the radar pulse vertical cross-section, the radius of the outer edge can be found using the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:

&lt;math&gt;H^2 + r_p^2 = (H + l_p)^2 = H^2+l_p^2+2Hl_p&lt;/math&gt;

where r&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the leading edge of the pulse.  If we assume l&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is small and can be neglected then we can solve for r&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; as:

&lt;math&gt; r_p = (2Hl_p)^{ \frac{1}{2}} = (Hct_p)^{ \frac{1}{2}} &lt;/math&gt;

The time evolution of the return power measured from the footprint of the radar signal reflecting off the ocean/land surface can be described in three parts: (1) the time before the pulse arrives, (2) the time after the beginning of the pulses arrival and before of the tail of the pulse has arrived, and (3) after the tail of the pulse has arrived.  The power function can then be expressed functionally as:

&lt;math&gt;P(t) = \begin{cases}
  0                                    &amp;   t&lt;t_o \\
  \pi r^2(t)                        &amp;  t_o&lt;t&lt;t_o+t_p \\
  \pi [r^2(t) - r^2(t-t_p)]   &amp;  t&gt;t_o+t_p \\ 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the equation for r_p and normalizing by the peak power yields:

&lt;math&gt;P(t) = \begin{cases}
  0                                    &amp;   t&lt;t_o \\
  \frac{t-t_o}{t_p}            &amp;  t_o&lt;t&lt;t_o+t_p \\
  \ 1                                  &amp;  t&gt;t_o+t_p \\ 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

This following plot demonstrates the power function for a radar wave pulse.  The power function should be constant with time after the full pulse reaches the ocean/land surface (at (t-t&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;)/t&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 1), however the power will actually decrease with time w.r.t the illumination pattern of the radar on the ocean/land surface.&lt;ref name=sandwell /&gt;

== Frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar altimetry ==
{{main | frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar }}

Alternatively, [[FMCW|Frequency Modulated Continuous-wave radar]] can be used. The greater the frequency shift the further the distance traveled. This method can achieve much better accuracy than the pulsed radar for the same outlay and radar altimeters that use [[frequency modulation]] are industry standard.

As of 2010, all commercial radar altimeters use linear frequency modulation - continuous wave (LFM-CW or FM-CW).
As of 2010, about 25,000 aircraft in the US have at least one radio altimeter.
That includes all commercial transport and all business aircraft licensed to fly for hire, which are required to have at least 2 radio altimeters per aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;

== Delay-Doppler (or SAR) altimetry ==

The primary difference between delay-doppler (or [[Synthetic Aperture Radar]]) and pulse-limited altimetry is that delay-doppler altimetry looks at a smaller section of the pulse-limited radar footprint, but emits far more pulse signals to give the effect of covering the same footprint as pulse-limited but with better resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radar Altimetry Tutorial: Delay-Doppler (or SAR) Altimetry|url=http://www.altimetry.info/html/alti/principle/alti_doppler_en.html|publisher=CNES|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The top-down view in the figure below shows the decreased footprint size of the delay-doppler signal.

[[File:Satellite Radar Diagram.jpg|230px|border|Satellite Radar Diagram]]      [[File:Delay-Doppler Radar Ground Footprint.jpg|border|287px|Delay-Doppler Radar Ground Footprint]]

In order to determine the power signal of the delay-doppler radar as a function of time, we'll need to assume that the footprint of the pulsed radar is small enough to be considered two rectangles of width W.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raney|first=R. K.|title=The Delay/Doppler Radar Altimeter|journal=IEEE Trans. Geoscience and Remote Sensing|year=1998|volume=36|pages=1578–1588}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows the power function to be similarly (see Pulse-limited section above) written as:

&lt;math&gt;P(t) = \begin{cases}
  0                                 &amp;   t&lt;t_o \\
  \ 2W r(t)                        &amp;  t_o&lt;t&lt;t_o+t_p \\
  \ 2W [r(t) - r(t-t_p)]       &amp;  t&gt;t_o+t_p \\ 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the equation for the radius derived in the previous section (see Pulse-limited section above), the power vs. time function, normalized by the time relative to the arrival time at the leading edge, &lt;math&gt; t'=t-t_o &lt;/math&gt;, becomes:

&lt;math&gt;P(t') = \begin{cases}
  0                                                                                              &amp;  t'&lt;0 \\
  \ (\frac{t'}{t_p})^\frac{1}{2}                                                       &amp;  0&lt;t'&lt;t_p \\
  \ (\frac{t'}{t_p})^\frac{1}{2}  - (\frac{t'}{t'-t_p})^\frac{1}{2}         &amp;  t'&gt;t_p \\ 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

An illustration of the normalized power vs. time function is shown below:

[[File:Satellite Delay-Doppler Radar Return Pulse Power.jpg|border|287px|Satellite Delay-Doppler Radar Return Pulse Power]]

There are two primary advantages that the delay-doppler method has over the traditional pulse-limited altimeter.  First,  the radar footprint is covering less area so the radar pulse emitted by the satellite requires much less power.&lt;ref name=sandwell /&gt;  It covers the radar footprint using more frequent, but less power consuming radar pulses.  Secondly, the return waveform has a more complex signature allowing the arrival time of the pulse to be more accurately constrained.&lt;ref name=sandwell /&gt;

== Error budget ==
The following list notes the error sources associated with radar altimetry measurements:

'''Tides''' - Tidal variations are much larger than the dynamic variations in sea surface height.&lt;ref name=tides&gt;{{cite web|title=Radar Altimetry Tutorial: Ocean tides|url=http://www.altimetry.info/html/alti/dataflow/processing/geophys_corr/ocean_tides_en.html|publisher=CNES|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because tidal periods can be on the order of diurnal and semidiurnal, the tides create an aliased frequency in the temporal variations in the sea level height that must be removed.&lt;ref name=tides /&gt;

'''Electromagnetic Bias''' - There is a sea state bias where the troughs of waves tend to focus waves back to the radar, while the crests of the waves scatter waves away from the radar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radar Altimetry Tutorial: Electromagnetic Bias|url=http://www.altimetry.info/html/alti/dataflow/processing/geophys_corr/electromagnetic_bias_en.html|publisher=CNES|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ionosphere''' - The ionosphere can also impose a delay on the radar return signal, where electron plasma in the ionosphere slow down the group velocity of the radar pulse.&lt;ref name=iono&gt;{{cite web|title=Radar Altimetry Tutorial: Ionospheric corrections|url=http://www.altimetry.info/html/alti/dataflow/processing/geophys_corr/ionosphere_en.html|publisher=CNES|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The electron density in the ionosphere varies throughout the day, complicating the ionosphere correction.&lt;ref name=iono /&gt;

'''Dry Troposphere''' - Refraction from the dry gas component of the atmosphere create a signal delay in the radar, but a correction can be approximated using the Saastamoinen formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radar Altimetry Tutorial: Dry troposphere correction|url=http://www.altimetry.info/html/alti/dataflow/processing/geophys_corr/dry_troposphere_en.html|publisher=CNES|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ΔRdry= -0.02277Po*(1+0.0026cos2φ) where Po is the sea level pressure in Pascal and φ the latitude.

'''Wet Troposphere''' - Water vapor can also cause a delay in the radar signal which can be more difficult to correct.&lt;ref name=wetTrop&gt;{{cite web|title=Radar Altimetry Tutorial: Wet troposphere correction|url=http://www.altimetry.info/html/alti/dataflow/processing/geophys_corr/wet_troposphere_en.html|publisher=CNES|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A delay correction for the total water column in the radar measurement can be accounted for using output from meteorological models, like ECMWF and NCEP.&lt;ref name=wetTrop/&gt;

==Invention==
In 1924, American engineer [[Lloyd Espenschied]] invented the radio altimeter. In 1938, Bell Labs put Espenschied's device in a form that was adaptable for aircraft use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Altitude: The instrument of choice|publisher=Cygnus Interactive|url=http://www.amtonline.com/publication/article.jsp?pubId=1&amp;id=1337}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 in co-operation with Bell Labs, United Air Lines fitted a radar type device to some of its airliners as a terrain avoidance device.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=69kDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YmMmTp_ZMszksQLn1cziCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Towers Flash Radio Beams To Detect Warplanes" ''Popular Mechanics'', September 1941]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil aviation applications==
Radar altimeters are frequently used by [[commercial aircraft]] for approach and landing, especially in low-visibility conditions (see [[instrument flight rules]]) and [[autoland|automatic landings]], allowing the autopilot to know when to begin the [[Flare (aviation)|flare maneuver]]. Radar altimeters give data to the [[autothrottle]] which is a part of the [[Flight Computer]].

Radar altimeters generally only give readings up to {{convert|2500|ft|m}} [[above ground level]] (AGL). 
Frequently, the weather radar can be directed downwards to give a reading from a longer range, up to {{convert|60,000|ft|m}} [[above ground level]] (AGL). 
{{As of|2012}}, all airliners are equipped with at least two and possibly more radar altimeters, as they are essential to autoland capabilities. ({{As of|2012}}, determining height through other methods such as [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] is not permitted by regulations.) Older airliners from the 1960s (such as the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] [[BAC 1-11]]) and smaller airliners in the sub-50 seat class (such as the [[ATR 42]] and [[BAe Jetstream]] series) are equipped with them.

Radar altimeters are an essential part in ground proximity warning systems ([[GPWS]]), warning the pilot if the aircraft is flying too low or descending too quickly. However, radar altimeters cannot see terrain directly ahead of the aircraft, only that below it; such functionality requires either knowledge of position and the terrain at that position or a forward looking terrain radar.  Radar altimeter antennas have a fairly large main lobe of about 80° so that at bank angles up to about 40°, the radar detects the range from the aircraft to the ground (specifically to the nearest large reflecting object).  This is because range is calculated based on the first signal return from each sampling period.  It does not detect slant range until beyond about 40° of bank or pitch.  This is not an issue for landing as pitch and roll do not normally exceed 20°.

The altitude specified by the device is not the indicated altitude of the standard barometric altimeter.  A radar altimeter measures '''absolute altitude''' - the height [[Above Ground Level]] (AGL).  Absolute altitude is sometimes referred to as '''height'''{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} because it is the height above the underlying terrain.

==Military aviation applications==
Radar altimeters are also used in [[military aircraft]] to fly quite low over the land and the sea to avoid [[radar]] detection and targeting by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s or [[surface-to-air missile]]s.  A related use of radar altimeter technology is [[terrain-following radar]], which allows [[Strike fighter|fighter bomber]]s to fly at very low altitudes.

The [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111]]s of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] have a forward-looking, terrain-following radar (TFR) system connected via digital computer to their automatic pilots.  Beneath the nose radome are two separate TFR antennae, each providing individual information to the dual-channel TFR system.  In case of a failure in that system, the F-111 has a back-up radar altimeter system, also connected to the [[Autopilot|automatic pilot]]. Then, if the F-111 ever dips below the preset minimum [[altitude]] (for example, 15 meters) for any reason, its automatic pilot is commanded to put the F-111 into a 2G fly-up (a steep nose-up [[climb (aeronautics)|climb]]) to avoid crashing into terrain or water. Even in combat, the hazard of a collision is far greater than the danger of being detected by an enemy. Similar systems are used by [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18 Super Hornet]] aircraft operated by Australia and the United States.

The radio altimeter first showed up in the German [[Junkers Ju 87]] "Stuka" dive bomber which was equipped with one for automatic pullouts in the dive bomb run which usually consisted of an 80-90 degree dive. The Stuka pilot would set the radio altimeter to 750m which was connected to the bomb release and automatic pull out. The radio altimeter would drop the bombs and pull the Stuka out of the dive at the set altitude to a level flight. This was invented because the pilots would black out on the pull out, usually for 2 to 5 seconds.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

'''South Central Siberia''' is a geographical region north of the point where Russia, China, Kazakhstan and Mongolia come together. 
[[File:Map of Russia - Kemerovo Oblast (2008-03).svg|300px|right|thumb|Kemerovo Oblast highlighted&lt;br/&gt;Kuznetsk Basin to the west and Minusinsk basin to the east.&lt;br/&gt;Altai Republic to the south, Altai Krai northwest of that and Tuva to the southeast]]
==The Four Corners==

[[Image:Zentralasien topo.png|thumb|330px|Topographic map of Central Asia. The area in question is between the Altai region and Novosibirsk.]]

[[Image:Altai, Tienschan-Orte.png|thumb|330px|The Altai Mountains and surrounding areas]]

At approximately {{Coord|49|8|8|N|87|33|46|E}}, the borders of [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Kazakhstan]] come intersect in the [[Altai Mountains]]. Mongolia and Kazakhstan are kept separate by a 40km stretch of the Sino-Russian border between the [[Altai Republic]], a federal subject of Russia, and [[Altay Prefecture]] in the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] of China. To the east, [[Tavan Bogd Uul]] in [[Bayan-Ölgii Province]], Mongolia, marks the end of the Sino-Russian border. To the west, is Kazakhstan's [[East Kazakhstan Province]].

The Altai mountains on the Russian side of the border have been designated a [[UNESCO]] [[world heritage site]].&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/768/&lt;/ref&gt;

==South: Altai Republic==
Above the "Four Corners" and in the southern part of South Central Siberia is the [[Altai Republic]] (not to be confused with the [[Altai Krai]] to the northwest). It contains the central knot to the [[Altai Mountains]]. The area is very mountainous and has few good roads. It was inhabited by various [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups who gradually became the [[Altay people]]. As the surrounding steppes filled with Russians, many of the lowland Turks were [[Russification|Russified]] or retreated to the mountains. The area only came under definitive Russian control in the 1860s. The [[M52 highway (Russia)]] runs northwest from here.

==Northern mountain range: Abakans and Kuznetsk Alatau==
Northern South Central Siberia includes the Altai Republic, which is a 400&amp;nbsp;km projection of forested mountains which bends slightly to the west at the tip. It is called the [[Abakan Range]] in the south and [[Kuznetsk Alatau]] in the north. North of its northern end is the town of [[Tomsk]].

==West: Kuznetsk Depression==
The west part of South Central Siberia includes the steppe of the [[Kuznetsk Depression]], which contains the large [[Kuznetsk Basin]] coal fields, the mountains of the Abakans and Kuznetsk Alatau and the [[Salair Ridge]] which ends near [[Novosibirsk]].

In the Soviet era, the Kuznetsk Basin coal fields were the largest Russian coal field after the Donets Basin. The name Kuznets means ''blacksmith'' and comes from the 'Blacksmith Tatars' or [[Shors]], who were notable metal workers.

The Russians reached the area as early as 1618. The Abakans, Kuznetsk Alatau and the Kuznetsk Basin form the [[Kemerovo Oblast]] with its mostly Russian population. The [[Tom River]] drains the basin and joins the [[Ob River]] north of [[Tomsk]]. The town of [[Novokuznetsk]] was founded in 1618.

==East: Minusinsk Depression==
The eastern part of South Central Siberia, between the Kuznetsk Alatau and the Sayan Mountains, includes the steppe of the [[Minusinsk Depression]] which is the core of [[Khakassia]]. The [[Yenisei River]] flows north through its center. The [[Abakan River]] flows from the base of the depression north and slightly east to the Yenisei at [[Abakan]] town, near where another river comes in from the east. [[Minusinsk]] town is a few miles east of Abakan. The [[Chulym River (Ob River)]] starts in the northwest corner of the depression, arcs into the Taiga north of the Alatau and joins the [[Ob River]]. East of the river is the southern tip of [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]].

This area was a center of the [[Afanasevo culture]], a suggested homeland for the [[Tocharian languages|Tocharians]]. Later it was the home of the [[Yenisei Kirghiz]], who gave their name to the [[Kyrgyz people|Kirgiz]] further south. The [[Khakas people|Khakas]] of Khakassia may be their descendants.

==Southeast: Tuva==
East of the Altai and southeast of Minusinsk is [[Tuva]]. Tuva is bordered on the south by the [[Tannu-Ola Mountains]], which separate it from the Mongolian [[Great Lakes Depression]], on the west by the Altai, on the northwest by the Western Sayans which separate it from the Minusinsk Depression, on the north by the Eastern Sayans and on the east by mountains on the Mongolian border.

The core area is the [[Tuva Depression]], where [[Kyzyl]] is located, the capital city of the [[Tuva Republic]]. The [[Yenisei River]] flows west here and then breaks through the Western Sayans in a long narrow gorge which contains the [[Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam]] north of the Tuva border. 

Tuva was traditionally part of [[Mongolia]], and only passed to the [[Soviet Union]]—Russia in the 20th century.

==Surrounding area==
To the north, South Central Siberia merges into the Siberian forests.

To the south, South Central Siberiamerges into the mountains along the former Sino-Soviet border. [[Dzungaria]] is directly to the south. 

To the west of South Central Siberia is the agricultural steppe of the [[Altai Krai]] with its Russian population. Here the [[Katun River]] and the [[Biya River]] join to form the [[Ob River]]. Further west, between the Ob and [[Irtysh River]]s are the [[Baraba steppe]] in the north and the Kalunda Steppe in the south.

To the east, the Western and then Eastern [[Sayan Mountains]] extend east to the southern tip of Lake Baikal.

==Other information==
*Large Towns in South Central Siberia include: [[Novosibirsk]], which is about 100&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Salair (town)|Salair]] on the Ob River; [[Tomsk]], which is about 50&amp;nbsp;km north of the Kuznetsk Alatau; [[Krasnoyarsk]], which is about 100&amp;nbsp;km north of the Minusinsk Depression on the Yenisei. [[Barnaul]], which is on the steppe south of Novosibirsk. 

*The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] runs through this region from [[Novosibirsk]] to [[Krasnoyarsk]]. 

*The area to the west is steppe or forest-steppe. The steppe curves around north of the Kuznetsk Alatau into the Minusinsk Depression. The land to the north and east is [[Taiga]].

*The Russians first entered the area in about 1620. Seeking furs, they stayed in the forest area to the north. Massive peasant colonization of the steppe area only began after about 1860.

'''Stavsnäs''' is a [[Urban areas in Sweden|locality]] situated on the north east part of the island ''Fågelbrolandet'' in [[Värmdö Municipality]], [[Stockholm County]], [[Sweden]] with 810 inhabitants in 2010.&lt;ref name=scb /&gt; As there are numerous holiday homes in the area, the population is significantly larger during summer. Stavsnäs is located 44 kilometers from central Stockholm and accessible by road.
[[File:Stavsnäs vinterhamn.jpg|thumb|left|''Vinterhamn'' of Stavsnäs.]]
Stavsnäs consists of three different parts; ''Stavsnäs By'' (the original picturesque wood-house village built up around the old harbour, dating back to medieval times), ''Stavsnäs Gärde'' (a modern housing area with detached houses and blocks of flats), and ''Stavsnäs Vinterhamn'' or ''Vinterhamn'' (the all-year ferry harbour connecting the nearby inhabited islands (such as [[Sandhamn]]) with the Stockholm bus transportation network).

In Stavsnäs By there is the old harbour, ''Sommarhamn'', a museum dedicated to the history of the archipelago and its inhabitants, ''Skärgårdsmuseet'', and a bakery and café which turns into a restaurant and bar in the evenings.

South of ''Vinterhamn'' on the island of ''Hölö'' (accessible by bridge from ''Fågelbrolandet''), [[Sjösala vals|Sjösala]], the [[summer house]] of [[Evert Taube]] and the [[Taube family]], is located.

[[File:Flarksträngkärr.jpg|thumb|String bog in the middle of [[Sweden]].]]
A '''string bog''' or '''strong mire''' is a [[bog]] consisting of slightly elevated ridges and islands, with woody plants, alternating with flat, wet [[sedge]] mat areas. String bogs occur on slightly sloping surfaces, with the ridges at right angles to the direction of water flow. They are an example of [[patterned vegetation]].  

Known as '''"aapa" moore''' (from [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''aapasuo'') or '''strangemoore''' in Northern Europe. 

A string bog has a pattern of narrow (2–3m wide), low (&lt;1m high) ridges oriented at right angles to the direction of drainage with wet depressions or pools occurring between the ridges. The water and peat are very low in nutrients because the water has been derived from other [[ombrotrophic]] wetlands, which receive all of their water and nutrients from precipitation, rather than from streams or springs.{{clarify|reason=Finnish Wikipedia says the opposite about 'aapasuo' – is there a difference between string bogs in different regions?|date=February 2016}} The peat thickness is &gt;1m.

String bogs are features associated with [[periglacial]] climates, where the temperature results in long periods of subzero temperatures. The active layer exists as frozen ground for long periods and melts in the spring thaw. Such slow melting results in characteristic mass movement processes and features exclusively associated with specific periglacial environments.

National Significant Numbers (NSN): seven or eight digits.

Format: +503 NXYZ MCDU where N is NDC.

==Number plan==
New number plan took effect in 2005.

The numbering plan for the Republic of El Salvador uses the following numbering structure:
:for services provided via eight (8) digit access networks including the National Destination Code (NDC),
:freephone numbers and premium rate numbers use seven (7) and eight (8) digits.

[[National Significant Number]] (NSN): eight digits.

Format: +505 XXXX XXXX

The Republic of [[Nicaragua]] has a closed [[numbering plan]] of eight digits.

The change from seven to eight digits occurred in 2009, by adding&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itu.int/oth/T020200009A/en&lt;/ref&gt;
*digit 2 (two) before the existing National Significant Number (NSN) for fixed services,
*digit 8 (eight) before the existing National Significant Number (NSN) for mobile services.
*digit 7 (seven) before the existing National Significant Number (NSN) for mobile services.
*digit 5 (five) before the existing National Significant Number (NSN) for mobile services.

[[File:WUPL-international.jpg|thumb|right|Logo of the international organization since 2014]]

The '''World Union for Protection of Life''' (German: Weltbund zum Schutz des Lebens, French: Union Mondiale pour la Protection de la Vie, Russian: Всемирный союз для защиты жизни) is an international non-profit organization and non-governmental organization which was founded 1958 in [[Salzburg]] (Austria) by the writer [[Günther Schwab]]. The concept ''Protection of Life'' is considered to be different from the protection of the [[Natural environment|environment]] as it has been used by the United Nations Environmental Program ([[UNEP]]), though that organization was founded as a result of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in 1972.

Günther Schwab is known as the author of the screenplay for the movie ''[[The Forester of the Silver Wood]]'' (1954). In his novel ''Der Tanz mit dem Teufel'' (''Dance with the Devil'') Günther Schwab gives his expressions to sentiments for [[nature]] protection and describes the destruction of nature as a plan of a devil who seems really existent. The book was translated in many [[language]]s, the first English translation was published 1963. In the year 1958 Schwab started to set up an organization with the name ''World Union for Saving of Life'' which was registered as ''World Union for Protection of Life'' two years later and soon activated branches in more than 30 countries all over the world.

== Germany ==

International congresses with scientist and church organizations mainly took place in German speaking countries.
Around the year 1968 the organization had several thousand members in the Federal Republic of Germany. Famous members were the physicist [[Karl Bechert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fes.de/archiv/1abt/beche-k.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316183016/http://www.fes.de/archiv/1abt/beche-k.htm |archivedate=16 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the chemist [[Hans-Adalbert Schweigart]].

The organization played an active role during the foundation of the German [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]], especially in [[Lower Saxony]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/diss/z2000/0105/pdf/z2000-0105.pdf "Die Beteiligungsformen der Grünen Parteien ..." [[Dissertation]] for [[doctorate]], written by Kuei-Hsiang Liao, 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719105923/http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/diss/z2000/0105/pdf/z2000-0105.pdf |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Austria ==

The organization was officially registered as ''World Union for Saving of Life'' on 24 September 1958 in Salzburg and is therefore one of the oldest anti-nuclear organization.
One of the famous members was the biologist [[Annie Francé-Harrar]]. The Austrian anti-nuclear power activist [[Robert Jungk]] engaged himself for the WUPL.&lt;ref&gt;LSI – Lebensschutzinformationen Heft 6/1983&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Austria)]] the national section was dissolved at December 31, 2012.

== International activities ==

[[File:Wsl-int1969.jpg|thumb|right|Old Logo of the international organization]]

According to its own publications the WUPL had ''sections'' in Australia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, South-Korea, South-Africa, Yugoslavia and USA.

A scientific advisory board of 400 scientists out of 53 countries supported the work of the organization. Among them were 40 Nobel laureates. President of the board was [[Linus Pauling]]. [[Günther Schwab]] himself held about 1500 public readings.

In Australia the WUPL tried to ward off the dangers connected with the building of the Atomic Reactor at [[Jervis Bay]], only about 130 miles from [[Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/ResourceMetadata/BBAQJM Letter from President of the South East Asia and Oceanic Region, Harry F. Kurth, Sydney, 8 April 1972]&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Union for Protection of Life gave the [[Hans-Adalbert Schweigart|Hans-Adalbert-Schweigart-Medal]] to:
* 1979: [[André Gernez]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]]
* 1983: [[Rosalie Bertell]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/pubs/women-femmes/can-usa/can-author-auteur_2-eng.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1986: [[Franz Weber (activist)|Franz Weber]]
* ????: [[Ralph Graeub]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.udeo.ch/html/graeub.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707004109/http://www.udeo.ch/html/graeub.html |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ????: [[Peter Weish]]

The seat of the international organization changed over the course of time, for example from [[Hannover]] to [[Bad Reichenhall]].&lt;ref&gt;''Yearbook of International Organizations.'' [[Brussels]] http://www.uia.org&lt;/ref&gt; 
After the death of Günther Schwab in 2006 there was a restructuring.

In 2008 – 50 years after foundation – the organization pledged for the Global Population Speak Out ([[GPSO]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.populationspeakout.org/pledges/gpso-2009-pledges List of GPSO Pledges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527082806/http://www.populationspeakout.org/pledges/gpso-2009-pledges |date=27 May 2011 }} published in February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009 the international stage was activated by scientists in 13 countries. For many organizations with similar goals has been set up since the 1970er, today the WUPL is only open for elected representatives of organizations with equal goals and members with a scientific qualification. In October 2009 the German text of the foundation document was published in the internet.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.xing.com/net/wupl&lt;/ref&gt; International Members took part in the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009]].

'''Yi-Fu Tuan''' (Traditional Chinese: 段義孚, born 5 December 1930) is a [[Chinese people|Chinese]]-[[American people|American]] [[geography|geographer]]. He is one of the key figures in [[human geography]] and arguably the most important originator of [[humanistic geography]].

==Early life and education==
Born in 1930 in [[Tianjin]], [[China]] to an [[upper-class]] family, he was educated in China, [[Australia]], the [[Philippines]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. He attended [[University College, London]], but graduated from the [[University of Oxford]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1951 and 1955 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yifutuan.org/Tuan%20Curriculum%20Vitae.pdf | title = Curriculum Vitae  Yi-Fu Tuan | date = 2008-04-08 | accessdate = 2011-02-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111002212037/http://www.yifutuan.org/Tuan%20Curriculum%20Vitae.pdf | archivedate = 2011-10-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From there he went to [[California]] to continue his geographic education.  He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1957 from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

==Career==

From [[New Mexico]] where he taught at the [[University of New Mexico]] from 1959 to 1965, Tuan then moved to [[Toronto]] between 1966 to 1968 teaching at [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yi-Fu Tuan|url=http://www.chiamonline.com/People/QU/tuan.htm|website=China Who's Who|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brinely|first1=Amanda|title=A Biography of the Famous Chinese-American Geographer Yi-Fu Tuan|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/geographer-yi-fu-tuan-1435031|website=ThoughtCo.|publisher=ThoughtCo.|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a full professor at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1968. In the same year he received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]. It was while he was at Minnesota that became known for his work in humanistic geography, but his forays into this approach began earlier which an article on topophilia which appeared in the journal ''Landscape''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article |last=Tuan |first=Yi-Fu |year=1961|title=Topophilia: or, Sudden Encounter with the Landscape |journal=Landscape |volume=11 |pages=29-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2004 "Dear Colleague" letter he described the difference between [[human geography]] and [[humanistic geography]]:

{{quote||Human geography studies human relationships. Human geography's optimism lies in its belief that asymmetrical relationships and exploitation can be removed, or reversed. What human geography does not consider, and what humanistic geography does, is the role [relationships] play in nearly all human contacts and exchanges. If we examine them conscientiously, no one will feel comfortable throwing the first stone. As for deception, significantly, only Zoroastrianism among the great religions has the command, "Thou shalt not lie." After all, deception and lying are necessary to smoothing the ways of social life.

From this, I conclude that humanistic geography is neglected because it is too hard. Nevertheless, it should attract the tough-minded and idealistic, for it rests ultimately on the belief that we humans can face the most unpleasant facts, and even do something about them, without despair.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yifutuan.org/archive/2004/20041116.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After 14 years at the University of Minnesota, he moved to [[Madison, Wisconsin]] and continued his professional career at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] as the J.K. Wright and Vilas Professor of Geography (1985–1998). He was elected a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1986, of the [[British Academy]] in 2001 and of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2002. Tuan was awarded the [[Cullum Geographical Medal]] by the [[American Geographical Society]] in 1987 and the [[Vautrin Lud Prize]] in 2012.

Tuan is an [[emeritus]] professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He occasionally gives lectures, continues to write his "Dear Colleague" letters and to publish new books on geosophy. His most recent books are ''Human Goodness'' (2008) and ''Religion: From Place to Placelessness'' (2010).  He resides in Madison, Wisconsin.

==Personal life==

Yi-Fu Tuan stayed single throughout his life. In his [[autobiography]],&lt;ref name=who-am-i&gt;{{cite book|last=Tuan|first=Yi-fu|title=Who am I?: An autobiography of emotion, mind, and spirit|year=1999|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=0299166600|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuan revealed his [[gay sexuality]] for the first time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a schoolboy in Australia, I was drawn to another boy. ... But my feeling toward another boy, an athlete with the sleek beauty of a well-oiled machine, was another matter. I couldn't persuade myself even then that it was just displaced longing for female loveliness. ... I was then fifteen.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tuan has not focused on either his ethnicity or his sexual preference in his research. Rather than stress axes of difference or social power relations, he has attempted to capture universal human experiences. He works to show nuances of common phenomena such as the experience of "home" that cut across cultural divides even as they reveal distinct manifestations in different places and times.

==Key Ideas and Approaches==

===''humanism''===
Tuan describes his approach as humanist, however his humanism does not entail replacing spirituality with rationalism or promoting human beings as wholly self-directed.&lt;ref name=Tuan1976&gt;{{Cite article |last=Tuan |first=Yi-Fu |year=1976 |title=Humanistic Geography |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=66 |pages=266–276 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1976.tb01089.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he sees humanist geography as a way to reveal "how geographical activities and phenomena reveal the quality of human awareness" and to show "human experience in its ambiguity, ambivalence, and complexity.".&lt;ref name=Tuan1976/&gt; To do so requires empathy, and for this he seeks assistance from literature, the arts, history, biography, social science, philosophy, and theology. Tuan’s approach is qualitative, but more narrative and descriptive than philosophical, in light of his concern that a philosophical theory can become "so highly structured that it seems to exist in its own right, to be almost ‘solid,’ and thus able to cast (paradoxically) a shadow over the phenomena it is intended to illuminate" whereas he prefers for theories to "hover supportively in the background."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article |last=Tuan |first=Yi-Fu |year=1991|title=Language and the Making of Place: A Narrative-Descriptive Approach |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=81 |pages=684–696 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1991.tb01715.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''contradictions and paradoxes''===
Tuan is most interested in ambivalent human experiences that resonate with the opposing pulls of space and place, the intimate and the distant. His approach is suggested by titles such as ''Segmented Worlds and Self, Continuity and Discontinuity, Morality and Imagination, Cosmos and Hearth, Dominance and Affection,'' and above all, ''Space and Place''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuan |first=Yi-Fu |title=Space and Place: The Perspective of Experience |place=Minneapolis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuan |first=Yi-Fu |title=Segmented Worlds and Self: Group Life and Individual Consciousness |place=Minneapolis |publisher= University of Minnesota Press |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article |last=Tuan |first=Yi-Fu |year=1984 |title=Continuity and Discontinuity |journal=Geographical Review |volume=74 |pages=245–256 |jstor=214937 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuan |first=Yi-Fu |title=Morality and Imagination: Paradoxes of Progress |place=Madison |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuan |first=Yi-Fu |title=Cosmos and Hearth: A Cosmopolite’s Perspective |place=Minneapolis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; These existential dialectics propel people between a pole of experience characterized by rootedness, security and grounding, on the one hand, and a pole characterized by outreach, potentiality and expansiveness, on the other hand. These opposites interact: there is a certain distance in what is nearby and a certain nearness in what is far away. Therefore ambivalence is the norm when it comes to the human experience of dwelling in the world with its existential pulls between space and place, mobility and stasis, the distant view and embodied engagement.

===''optimism''===
Tuan is fundamentally an optimist. Even Tuan’s gloomiest book, ''Landscapes of Fear'', concludes that things were worse in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuan |first=Yi-Fu |title=Landscapes of Fear |place=New York |publisher= Pantheon Books |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Tuan, historical changes have been for the better overall: "In the larger view, the human story is one of progressive sensory and mental awareness… culture, through laborious and labyrinthine paths traversed over millennia, has greatly and variedly refined our senses and mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuan |first=Yi-Fu |title=Passing Strange and Wonderful: Aesthetics, Nature, and Culture |place=Washington DC |publisher=Island Press |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progress itself depends on particular ways of dealing with the tensions between space and place, cosmos and hearth, dominance and affection, morality and imagination. The promise of the future lies in recognizing the existential poles of nearness and remoteness and how they are reflected in each other.

===''constructionism''===
Tuan has foregrounded the importance of language in the making of place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article |last=Tuan |first=Yi-Fu |year=1991 |title=Language and the Making of Place: A Narrative-Descriptive Approach |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=81 |pages=684–696 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1991.tb01715.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his works, texts such as poems, novels, letters, and myths are understood as integral elements in the creation of a sense of place. Human communications form the basis for the social processes of imagining, understanding, planning and conceiving places. Representations guide the human and material interactions creating, sustaining, and destroying places. Tuan's deep reflection on the role of representation in the creation of place forms an important foundation for the [[geography of media and communication]].

The '''Zambezi Belt''' is an area of [[orogeny|orogenic]] deformation in southern [[Zambia]] and northern [[Zimbabwe]]. It is a segment of a broader belt lying between the [[Congo Craton]] and the [[Kalahari Craton]], which also includes the [[Lufilian Arc]] and the [[Damaran Belt]].
The eastern margin of the belt interacts with the north-south [[Eastern African orogen]].{{sfn|Johnson|Oliver|2002|pp=271-290}}

The Zambezi belt shows evidence of two large tectonothermal events, one between about 890-880&amp;nbsp;Ma{{#tag:ref |Ma = million years ago |group=fn}}
and the other about 550-520&amp;nbsp;Ma. Both events reworked existing [[Archean]] to [[Mesoproterozoic]] components, with small additions of younger material.{{sfn|Johnson|Oliver|2002|pp=271-290}}
The second event was caused by the collision of the Congo and Kalahari cratons during the assembly of the [[Gondwana]] [[supercontinent]] at the end of the [[Neoproterozoic]].{{sfn|Hargrove et al. 2003|pp=159-186}}
The belt includes the Kadunguri [[Whiteschist]]s, which were formed by metasomatic alteration at high pressures of ocean-island-type [[metabasalt]]s during the [[Pan-African orogeny]].{{sfn|Johnson|Oliver|2002|pp=271-290}}

The [[Mwembeshi Shear Zone]] forms the northern boundary of the Zambezi Belt, separating it from the Lufilian Arc.{{sfn|Mumbwa Geology}}
The [[shear zone]] also dates to the Pan-African orogeny.
It allowed a change in the structural [[Vergence (geology)|vergence]], or direction of folding, between the Zambezi Belt and the Lufilian Arc.{{sfn|Yoshida|Windley|Dasgupta|2003|p=418}}
