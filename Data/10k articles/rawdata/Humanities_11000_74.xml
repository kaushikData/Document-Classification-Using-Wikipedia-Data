'''Age of consent reform''' is efforts to change [[age of consent]] laws.  Proposed reforms typically include raising, lowering, or abolishing the age of consent, applying (or not applying) close-in-age exemptions, changing penalties, or changing how cases are examined in court. A related issue is whether or not to apply ages of consent to [[homosexual]] relationships that are different from those applied to [[heterosexual]] relationships.  Organized efforts have ranged from academic discussions to political petitions.

==Initiatives to change the age of consent==
There have been many initiatives to raise the age of consent. [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], a canon lawyer in the 12th century, stated that consent could not take place before 7 years of age. The English government eventually decided on age of 12 for women as their limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/childhood/A-Ar/Age-of-Consent.html |title=Age of Consent – Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society |publisher=Faqs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the age was about 12 in most countries. Today it is usually set between 15 and 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/age-of-consent.htm |title=Worldwide Ages of Consent |publisher=Avert.org |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Age of consent reform (UK)}}
In 1275, the age of consent in England was set at 12 (Westminster 1 statute), the first time an age of consent had been set in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Robertson, Stephen|title=Age of Consent Laws|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/case-studies/230|website=Children and Youth in History|publisher=[[University of Sydney]]|accessdate=3 August 2015|location=[[Sydney]], [[Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1875 the [[Offences against the Person Act 1875|Offence Against the Persons Act]] raised it to 13 in Great Britain and Ireland. The [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885|Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885]] raised it to 16.&lt;ref name="Odem1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary E.

According to sociologist Matthew Waites, in the 1970s, a number of grassroots political actions took place in Britain in favor of lowering the age of consent, which he described as based on claims of children's rights, gay liberation, or as a way to avoid unwanted pregnancies or [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.&lt;ref name=waites&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Waites|title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship|url=http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/the-age-of-consent-matthew-waites/?K=9781403921734|date=15 August 2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-23718-6}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=kLhhPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=he+Age+of+Consent+%E2%80%93+Young+People,+Sexuality+and+Citizenship&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aQNAVc7IG_P9sATxj4DwDw&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA Google books link])&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1974, the [[Campaign for Homosexual Equality]] suggested a basic age of consent of 16, but 12 "in cases where a defendant could prove the existence of meaningful consent".&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, op.cit., pp. 132 and 243, Note 6.6)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay News, no. 46, 9 May 1974, p.3 – 'CHE Report angers reformers'.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1974, the [[Homosexual Law Reform Society|Sexual Law Reform Society]] proposed lowering the age of consent to 14, with the requirement that below the age of 18  the burden of proof that consent for sexual activities between the parties existed would be the responsibility of the older participant.&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, op.cit., p.132).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the British political advocacy group [[Liberty (pressure group)|the National Council for Civil Liberties]] (now known as ''Liberty'') published a proposal advocating reducing the age of consent laws to 10 years of age, only when both individuals are younger than 14, with a close-in-age exemption of two years if one of the involved individuals is older than 14 but younger than 16.&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, p.135-136).

New York/London: Palgrave MacMillan. {{ISBN|978-1-4039-2173-4}}. {{ISBN|1-4039-2173-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The report was signed by [[Harriet Harman]], who later went on to become a prominent figure in government and deputy leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the focus of media attention due to her affiliations with the NCCL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/4949555/Harriet-Harman-under-attack-over-bid-to-water-down-child-pornography-law.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Martin | last=Beckford | title=Harriet Harman under attack over bid to water down child pornography law | date=March 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Russia in 1998 lowered the age of consent from 16 to 14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_19123/#p29 | title=25 июня 1998 года N 92-ФЗ}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2002 raised the age of consent from 14 back to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_45408/#p243| title=8 декабря 2003 года N 162-ФЗ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ageofconsent.com/russia.htm |title=Russia – Age of Consent |author=Peter Graff |date=June 28–29, 2002 |publisher=Reuters (via Age of Consent) |accessdate=August 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927121103/http://www.ageofconsent.com/russia.htm |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ageofconsent.com/russia.htm |title=Russia |publisher=Age of Consent |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927121103/http://www.ageofconsent.com/russia.htm |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then penalties have also generally increased. Vladimir Putin said that a party advocating lowering the age of consent cannot be legally registered (hence, be a legal party) in Russia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===India===
In January 2004, a [[Division bench]] of the [[Kerala]]'s [[Kerala High Court|High Court]] in Southern [[India]] suggested that the age of consent should be raised from 16 to 18 in that state. Justice R. Basant said he considered "illogic(al)" that a legal system in which an age of 18 is used for other purposes – like the Indian Majority Act, the Contract Act, the [[Juvenile Justice Act]], the [[Child Marriage in India|Child Marriage Restraint Act]] and the Representation of People Act – has a different approach in the case of sexual consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiansexgazette.com/asg/south_asia/southasia03news67.htm |title=Kerala, Raise age-limit for giving consent for sexual intercourse to 18 – South Asia |publisher=Asian Sex Gazette |date=2004-01-21 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of consent in India was raised from 16 to 18 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-05-23/india/31826039_1_children-from-sexual-offences-sexual-abuse-courts-for-speedy-trial | work=The Times Of India | title=Parliament clears bill against child abuse | date=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Ages of consent in the United States}}
Over the course of American history, the most commonly observed age of consent was 10 years. In 1880, 37 states had an age of consent of 10 years while 10 states kept an age of consent at 12, and Delaware maintained its age of consent at seven years, having lowered it from 10 in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 15, 1895|title=[[:s:The_New_York_Times/1895/10/15/Purity_Congress_Meets|PURITY CONGRESS MEETS; A Great Gathering for Moral Work in the City of Baltimore.

In the late-19th century, a "[[social purity movement]]" composed of Christian feminist reform groups began advocating a raise in the age of consent to 16, with the goal of raising it ultimately to 18, and by 1920 almost all states had raised their age of consent to 16 or 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/teacher/aoc.htm |title=The Campaign to Raise the Age of Consent 1885–1914 |author= |date= |work=Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600–2000 |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s, there was widespread sympathy among homosexual activist groups for lowering the age of consent for all sexual activities (partially due to the disparate ages of consent for same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activity),&lt;ref name="Warner2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Warner|title=Never Going Back: A History of Queer Activism in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mdo-95q2EYgC&amp;pg=PA124|year=2002|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8460-6|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many gay publications freely discussing lowering it for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t3RDzkqR_88C|publisher = Oxford University Press, USA|date = 2006-03-15|isbn = 9780198039723|first = Philip Jenkins Distinguished Professor of History and Religious Studies Pennsylvania State|last = University|page = 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tensions and antagonisms continued among activist circles until the 1980s; however, since the 1970s, [[gay liberation]]ist groups promoting frontline advocacy against the age of consent were falling into decline.&lt;ref name="Warner2002" /&gt; 

A small number of voices continued into the 2000s among self-declared pedophiles on certain [[internet]] websites and chatrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = On the Web, Pedophiles Extend Their Reach|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/technology/21pedo.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2006-08-21|access-date = 2015-10-20|issn = 0362-4331|first = Kurt|last = Eichenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two final states legislating their ages of consent into the 15–18 range were Georgia and Hawaii, from 14, raised in 1995 and 2001, respectively.

As of August 1, 2018, the age of consent in each state in the United States was either 16 years of age, 17 years of age, or 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Age of Consent across the United States |url = https://www.ageofconsent.net/states|work = AgeOfConsent.net|access-date = 2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alabama====
In 2012, Alabama State Representative Mac McCutcheon sponsored a bill to raise the age of consent from 16 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;http://whnt.com/2012/04/30/lawmaker-pushes-bill-to-raise-age-of-consent-in-alabama/&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2018, the age of consent in Alabama remains 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = State-by-State Marriage "Age of Consent" Laws|url = https://family.findlaw.com/marriage/state-by-state-marriage-age-of-consent-laws.html|work = FindLaw.com|access-date = 2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hawaii====
In 2001, the legislature in Hawaii voted to raise the age of consent from 14 to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=e5Az1lGCJwQC |page=1118 }} |title=Far East and Australasia 2003 – Eur |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Georgia====
In June 2005, a bill was proposed before the General Assembly of Georgia (USA) to raise the age of consent from 16 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2005_06/fulltext/hb722.htm |title=hb722.html |publisher=Legis.state.ga.us |date=2005-07-01 |accessdate=2012-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804092842/http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2005_06/fulltext/hb722.htm |archivedate=2009-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.ga.gov/legis/2005_06/search/hb722.htm |title=Georgia General Assembly – HB 722 |publisher=Legis.ga.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722045004/http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2005_06/search/hb722.htm |archivedate=2012-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill failed, however. 

Georgia was the most notoriously resistant state to raising its age of consent in the early 1900s.  Georgia's age of consent was  10 until 1918, and even then the age of consent was only raised to 14. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=KtMRAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA336&amp;lpg=PA336&amp;dq=1918+georgia+age+of+consent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-35YG3-ON2&amp;sig=5-9-iSWz7tDGkAQo8AqaUc2F_mU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjriceHwd3YAhUlTd8KHTnJDkEQ6AEISTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=1918%20georgia%20age%20of%20consent&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;Even after raising the age of consent in 1918, Georgia was still the only state in the United States to have an age of consent lower than 16. &lt;ref&gt;http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/case-studies/230?section=primarysources&amp;source=24&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia's age of consent remained at 14 until 1995, when a bill proposed by senator Steve Langford to make the age of consent 16 passed.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19950207&amp;id=gU5OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CRUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2408,2396348&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 2006, following the infamous case of Genarlow Wilson ([[Wilson v. State]]), aggravated child molestation was reduced to a misdemeanor with a maximum of one year in prison if the offender was under 19, the victim was either 14 or 15 years old, and the offender is no more than 48 months older than the victim. (Georgia penal code, 16-6-4). Previously aggravated child molestation (at any age) carried 10–20 years imprisonment regardless of the age difference between the victim and offender.

====Kentucky====
In 2007 in Kentucky Representative JR Gray sponsored legislation in the state legislature that passed making it a felony for a teacher to have sex with a student under the age of 18. He also discussed the possibility of raising the age of consent from 16 to 18 but a bill was not produced for that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2007-11-02-misconduct_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Robert | last=Tanner | title=States target sexual misconduct in schools | date=November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Missouri====
In 2008 a bill was proposed in the Missouri legislature to raise the age of consent from 17 to 18. It was sponsored by Representative Stanley Cox.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joplinglobe.com/local/x212127249/Missouri-House-bill-would-raise-age-of-consent-to-18&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Carolina====
In South Carolina in 2007 a bill was proposed before the legislature to raise the age of consent from 16 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrdw.com/home/headlines/5431721.html&lt;/ref&gt; It did not succeed.

====Wisconsin====
Prior to 1981 Wisconsin had an exception to the law that allowed adults who were guilty of sex with minors 15 or older to use as a defense that the victim understood the nature of the sexual act, but there was a rebuttable presumption in Wisconsin that minors under the age of 18 were not capable of informed consent to sex, but as stated, this could be argued against by the defendant in the court of law if the minor was 15 years of age or older. In 1981 the age of consent was lowered from 18 to 16 in Wisconsin, but at the same time it was made an automatic felony to have sex with anyone under 16, informed consent for a 15-year-old was no longer a defense an adult defendant could use in court. In 1983 the age of consent in Wisconsin was raised from 16 to 18, under the new law sex with a minor 16 or older carried the lesser penalty of a Class A Misdemeanor. A marital exemption was included in the law for an adult who was married to a minor 16 or older, but no close-in-age exception was.&lt;ref&gt;Owzsewski, DJ Statutory Rape in Wisconsin 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, the Canadian government proposed a bill to raise the age of consent from 14 to 16 (in 1890, it was raised from 12 to 14), while creating a near-age exemption for sex between 14- to 15-year-olds and partners less than 5 years older, and keeping an existing near-age clause for sex between 12–13 year olds and partners less than 2 years older. The initiative also maintains a temporary exception for already existing marriages of minors 14 and 15 years old to adults, but forbids new marriages like these in the future.&lt;ref name="ctv.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060623/age_consent_faq_060623/20060623/ |title=Age of Consent FAQ |publisher=CTV.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law took effect 1 May 2008.

===Netherlands===
Between 1990 and 2002, the Netherlands operated what was in effect an age of consent of 12, subject to qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=yit1CY_4BRMC }} |title=Regulating Sex: The politics of Intimacy and Identity |author=Elizabeth Bernstein, Laurie Schaffner |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant law, passed in November, 1990, permitted sexual intercourse for young people between 12 and 16, but allowed a challenge by parents based on erosion of parental authority or child exploitation, which would be heard by a Council for the Protection of Children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans |first=David T. |year=1993 |title=Sexual Citizenship: The Material Construction of Sexualities |page=208 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-05799-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=no-94x3v74IC&amp;pg=PT208&amp;dq=evans+1993+Sexual+Citizenship:+The+Material+Construction+of+Sexualities&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=puc_VfLwD_XfsATrsoE4&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=netherlands&amp;f=false}} (link is to the 2013 edition)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the Dutch [[Pacifist Socialist Party]] supported an unsuccessful petition to lower the age of consent to 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brongersma |first=Edward |year=1988 |chapter=Schutzalter 12 Jahre? – Sex mit Kindern in der niederländischen Gesetzgebung |trans-chapter=Age of Consent 12 years?

===Peru===
The age of consent in [[Peru]] was increased from 14 to 18 in 2006 as elections approached, but in 2007, Peru's new Congress voted to return the age to 14 regardless of gender and/or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=Peru001 &gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/06/22/world/main2970190.shtml |title=Peru Lowers Age Of Consent To 14 |publisher=CBS News |date=22 June 2007  |accessdate=28 Jan 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after strong public opposition, the law was raised back to 18 on June 27, 2007, by a vote of 74 to zero (22 abstentions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.congreso.gob.pe/Sicr/Prensa/heraldo.nsf/CNnoticiasanteriores/fc34916372aa85c9052573070053ab5a?OpenDocument |title=Pleno Reconsidero Exoneracion de Sedunda Votacion a Proyecto Sobre Libertad Sexual |date=2007-06-27 |publisher=El Heraldo |language=Spanish |trans-title=House Reconsidered and Excluded Second Vote for Project on Sexual Freedom |accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was returned to 14 in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tc.gob.pe/jurisprudencia/2013/00008-2012-AI.pdf| title = Demanda de inconstitucionalidad interpuesta por diez mil seiscientos nueve ciudadanos contra el artículo 1° de la Ley N° 28704 que modifica el artículo 173°, inciso 3° del Código Penal, sobre delito de violación sexual contra víctima entre 14 y 18 años de edad | language = Spanish | date = 2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In 1977 while a reform in the French penal code was under discussion in the parliament, a [[French petition against age of consent laws|petition to decriminalize]] all consented relations between adults and [[minor (law)|minor]]s below the age of fifteen was sent to Parliament but did not succeed in changing the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foucault |first=Michel |authorlink=Michel Foucault |title=Politics, Philosophy, Culture: Interviews and Other Writings 1977–1984 |editor-first=Lawrence D. |editor-last=Krizman |location=New York / London |year=1988 |publisher=Routledge |pages=272–273 |isbn=0-415-90082-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978 the petition was discussed in a broadcast by radio [[France Culture]] in the program "Dialogues", with the transcript later published under the title [[Sexual Morality and the Law]] in a book by [[Michel Foucault]]. The participants, including Foucault, play-writer/actor [[Jean Danet]] and novelist/gay activist [[Guy Hocquenghem]] had all signed the petition.

===Pedophile advocacy===
Some [[pedophiles]] have called to abolish the age of consent to allow adults to have sex freely with  prepubescent children, arguing they can consent.&lt;ref name=jenkins2006&gt;{{cite book|title=Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America |first=Philip |last=Jenkins |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=120|isbn=0-19-517866-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexual Abuse of Males: The Sam Model of Theory and Practice |last= Spiegel |first=Josef |year=2003 |pages=5, p9 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 1-56032-403-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups advocating pedophilia and the abolishment of age of consent laws include [[NAMBLA]] in the United States and [[Vereniging Martijn]] in the Netherlands. [[List of pedophile and pederast advocacy organizations|Several organisations]] in them have been involved with [[pro-pedophile activism]] in the past; only a few of these still exist today.

==Close-in-age exemptions==
{{main article|Statutory rape#Romeo and Juliet laws|l1=Romeo and Juliet laws}}
In the United States, many states have adopted close-in-age exemptions. These laws, known as "Romeo and Juliet laws"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Is a Romeo and Juliet Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-romeo-and-juliet-law|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide that a person can legally have consensual sex with a minor provided that he or she is not more than a given number of years older, generally four years or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Volokh|first1=Eugene|title=Statutory rape laws and ages of consent in the U.S.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/01/statutory-rape-laws-in-the-u-s/|accessdate=5 September 2017|publisher=Washington Post|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stateline/&gt; Some Romeo and Juliet laws (such as the law in Michigan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MCL 28.728c. Petition to discontinue registration|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&amp;objectname=mcl-28-728c|website=Michigan Legislature|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Florida&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Statutes, Sec. 943.04354. Removal of the requirement to register as a sexual offender or sexual predator in special circumstances.|url=http://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2016/943.04354|website=Florida Senate|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) do not make it legal for a person below the age of consent to have sex with a slightly older person, but may exempt the older partner from [[Sex offender registries in the United States|sex offender registration]].

Romeo and Juliet laws were passed in 2007 in Connecticut and Indiana.&lt;ref name=stateline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2007/07/16/new-laws-take-romeo-into-account |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024022131/http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2007/07/16/new-laws-take-romeo-into-account |archivedate=2015-10-24 |dead-url=no |title=New laws take 'Romeo' into account |author=John Gramlich |date=July 16, 2007 |work=Stateline.org |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Indiana, a change in the law decriminalizes consensual sex between adolescents if they are found by a court to be in a "dating relationship" with an age difference of four years or less&lt;ref name=stateline/&gt; and other states have adopted other reforms. Michigan passed a Romeo and Juliet Law in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uppermichiganssource.com/news/story.aspx?id=608159 |title=Understanding the Romeo &amp; Juliet Law |first1=Noël |last1=McLaren |date=April 20, 2011 |work=Upper Michigan's Source |accessdate=August 18, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006032345/http://www.uppermichiganssource.com/news/story.aspx?id=608159 |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These reforms have been controversial. In Texas, Governor [[Rick Perry]] vetoed Romeo and Juliet laws that had been passed by the legislature in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grissom |first1=Brandi |title=Gov.

Limon]] case, Kansas's Romeo and Juliet law was found to be unconstitutional because it excluded same-sex sexual conduct.

Some countries other than the United States also have Romeo and Juliet laws. Ireland's 2006 law has been contested because it treats girls differently from boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ireland.com/news/romeo-and-juliet-laws-contested/601105 |title='Romeo and Juliet' laws contested |author= |date= |work=Irish Times |accessdate=August 18, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321024739/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/romeo-and-juliet-laws-contested-1.874880| archivedate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0414/299909-supremecourt/ |title=Court urged to change 'Romeo and Juliet' laws |author= |date=April 14, 2011 |work=RTÉ News |accessdate=August 18, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407054400/http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0414/299909-supremecourt/ |archivedate=2013-04-07 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early '''architectural photographers''' include [[Roger Fenton]], [[Francis Frith]] (Middle East and Britain), [[Samuel Bourne]] (India) and [[Albert Levy (photographer)|Albert Levy]] (United States and Europe). They paved the way for the modern speciality of [[architectural photography]]. Later architectural photography had practitioners such as [[Ezra Stoller]] and [[Julius Shulman]]. Stoller worked mainly on the east coast of America, having graduated with a degree in architecture in the 1930s. Shulman, who was based on the West Coast, became an architectural photographer after some images that he had taken of one of [[Richard Neutra]]'s houses in California made their way onto the architect's desk.

'''Armelin's calendar''' was developed around 1887 by French astronomer Gustave Armelin, who developed a twelve-month [[calendar]] in which the year of 364 days was divided into four equal quarters of 91 days.

Armelin's calendar proposal was discussed chiefly under the auspices of the [[French Astronomical Society|Société astronomique de France]] in 1887 and recently in the [[Académie des Sciences|French Academy of Sciences]]&lt;!-- and was almost adopted in [[Europe]] in 20th century --&gt;.

==Structure==
# The year is divided into four quarters of three months each, and the arrangements for the first quarter repeat in each of the other quarters. The first and second month of each quarter have thirty days, and the third month thirty-one days. This accounts for 91 days in each quarter, or 364 days in all.
# The remaining day in ordinary years is "New Year's Day," It is given no other descriptive title. It does not belong to any week or any month. It begins the year. January 1 is the day following New Year's Day.
# The 366th day of leap year is likewise an extra day, bearing an appropriate descriptive name, perhaps "Leap Day," but no week-day name, nor is it a part of any month. It is the day following December 31, and the day preceding New Year's Day. It is assumed to be a holiday — it occurs once every four years. It could follow June 31, if preferred.
# January 1 falls on Monday, as do April 1, July 1, and October 1. The second months in each quarter (February, May, August and November) begin always on Wednesday; and the third months in each quarter (March, June, September and December) begin always on Friday. The first day of the month never falls on Sunday; the fifteenth day of the month never falls on Sunday; the thirtieth day of the month never falls on Sunday; the last day of each quarter — the thirty-first of March, June, September, December — always falls on Sunday. The thirty-day months always have four Sundays each; and the thirty-one-day months always have five Sundays each. The number of business days (non-weekends) in each month is twenty-six.
# Since 91 is  multiple  to  number 7, each  quarter  has  13 weeks, and begins on the same day of week. &lt;!-- this repeats the first point: The 365th day of each year is considered «out of week». It falls before the first of January and it was called the  New Year Day. --&gt;
# The calendar is therefore [[Perennial calendar|perennial]], since the dates of the year always fall on the same weekday, and the same calendar table represents every year.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The advantages of this simple system are evident. The months are nearly equal in length, and all have the same number of business days. Any given day of any month falls on the same day of the week each year. A mind of modest ability will learn in a few minutes the weekday with which each month invariably begins, and will be able to compute quickly the day of the week upon which any day of any month falls. Each stated holiday falls upon its invariable day of the week. [[Thanksgiving Day]] falls always on November 30.&lt;ref&gt;W.W. Campbell, Shall we reform the calendar? Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific&lt;/ref&gt;

A major disadvantage is for [[Sabbath in seventh-day churches|sabbatarians]], who are obliged to worship every seventh day. Their holy day will occur on a different weekday every year.

Armelin's project received the first premium of the [[French Astronomical Society]]. The [[World Calendar]], roughly identical, has been promoted by the World Calendar Association since 1930.[http://www.theworldcalendar.org]

''Art and Documentation'' focuses on works of an ephemeral nature, i.e. conceptual or post-conceptual works and related issues and documentation and documenting of [[contemporary art]] as well as creating art based on documentation. It also publishes [[primary source]]s - gallery timelines, manifestos, artists' statements etc. The journal's aim is to include research on art within the broader field of performance studies, strengthen the relationship between academic research on art and contemporary art practices, and combine theory and practice in a more direct way. This is reflected in the topics presented in the journal and the extended scope of research and methodologies that are becoming more diverse and interdisciplinary.

Editorial board: Łukasz Guzek (chief editor), Anka Lesniak (managing editor), Jozef Robakowski, Aurelia Mandziuk, Adam Klimczak, Anne Seagrave (English proofreading), Norbert Trzeciak (graphic design).

The '''Association of Historians of Nineteenth-Century Art''' was formed in 1993. International in its scope, the organization provides a means for [[scholars]] of nineteenth-century art from around the world to share ideas and resources through a variety of venues including conferences sessions, a newsletter and a [[Academic journal|scholarly journal]], Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide. 

Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide was the first online, [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal devoted to the study of nineteenth-century art. This journal has been cited by organizations like the [[Carnegie Corporation]] as a model for the electronic dissemination of [[scholarly method|scholarship]].&lt;ref name="Notable 'Transforming Disciplines Websites"&gt;[http://www.carnegie.rice.edu/sites.cfm Notable 'Transforming Disciplines Websites,'" from the conference on Transforming Disciplines: Computer Science and the Humanities, New York, 17-18 January 2003.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610163139/http://www.carnegie.rice.edu/sites.cfm |date=June 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''South America'''

Many of the Museum’s accessions come from the [[South America]]n continent. One of the notable collections of the MPC is the ancient [[Andean]] textiles. The Spoerl Collection and the Cheesman Collection account for the majority of these textiles. The Spoerl Collection contains mostly textiles and textile production tools but the Cheesman Collection contains other ancient and modern artifacts from South America. The majority of the textiles from both collections date from the prehistoric period in [[Peru]]. There is a current exhibit, [https://mpc.byu.edu "Greater than Gold: Textiles of the Ancient Andes"], displaying many of these textiles that will run through late 2016.

The Barlow Collection is specifically from [[Costa Rica]] and [[Nicaragua]] and contains mostly ancient pottery. However, there are other artifacts such as axe heads and [[projectile points]] within the collection. The Birrell Collection contains ethnographic textiles from Mesoamerica and South America.

The Bowen Collection contains fine examples of ancient Mesoamerican pottery. The Krenusz Collection contains little pottery but has other important pieces like metal axe heads, blades and projectile points. The jade figurines and jewelry are also a highlight of this collection. Some of the most unusual objects from the Krenusz Collection are the ancient Mexican stamps which display a variety of animal and geometric designs. The Cluff Collection contains unusual black pottery which was acquired on an expedition by Benjamin Cluff to the American Southwest and Mesoamerica in the early 20th century.

'''The American Southwest and Great Basin'''

The [[American Southwest]] and the [[Great Basin]] is another region that accounts for a large portion of the Museum’s collections. One select collection from this area is the Dillman Collection. This collection contains a variety of [[Ute people|Ute]] objects made in the 1930s on [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] reservations in eastern Utah. This collection contains mostly baskets and leather pieces but there are some archeological objects as well. The leather pieces in particular exhibit the superb craftsmanship of the Ute artists and show how their beliefs influenced their work. Part of this collection was on display in the early 1990s.

The recently acquired Reidhead Collection from the site of Fourmile Ruin in [[Arizona]] is another impressive holding of the Museum. Altogether this collection contains 8,712 items including 1,000 whole vessels and 2,000 arrowheads. The pottery is the main highlight of this collection and displays a variety of  [[Hopi]] Yellow Ware and White Mountain Red Ware. Additionally, there are a variety of other artifacts which reveal more about the Native American civilization at Fourmile Ruin. Some of the objects from this collection are part of the Museum's current exhibit ''New Lives: Building Community at Fourmile Ruin''.

The Turley Collection contains objects from [[Casas Grandes]]. Most of the collection contains pottery styles such as Ramos Black, Madera Black-on-Red and Villa Ahumada. Although the majority of the pottery in this collection is in the form of pots and bowls, there are also impressive examples of [[Effigy|effigy jars]].The pottery displays a variety of geometric designs and patterns and is frequently intermixed with representative drawings of animals and plants.

* The Dillman Collection contains 709 items and includes: Ancient and ca. 1930s Ute baskets, leather pieces (moccasins, belts, purses, pouches, gloves), game pieces, [[mano (stone)|mano]]s, [[metate]]s, some pottery.

'''Polynesia'''

[[Polynesia]] is another important area of collections. Two select collections that contribute to the Polynesian collection are the Snow Collection and the Clark Collection. Both of these contain a number of [[tapa cloth]]s and mats. The Snow Collection also displays many examples of jewelry and fans and the Dacosta Clark Collection contains spears, blades and clothing. Other Polynesian collections contain a variety of baskets, carved figurines and [[totem]]s, and ceremonial clothing. These objects provide a deeper understanding of the cultures of [[Fiji]], [[Hawaii]], [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]] and Australia.

* The Snow Collection contains	211 items and includes;	[[tapa cloths]] and mats, jewelry, fans, purses, fishing tools, spears, and daggers.
* The Dacosta Clark Collection contains 105 items and includes: [[tapa cloth]]s and mats, jewelry, fans, blades, spears, shells, baskets, women’s skirts.

'''Brigham Young University Department of Anthropology Excavations'''

The Museum also has extensive excavated collections from the Department of Anthropology. There are over 100,000 lots which contain over 1,000,000 individual artifacts of sherds, lithics, projectile points and soil samples. The artifacts come from various archaeological sites across Utah with an emphasis in the areas of Utah Valley and southeastern and central Utah. Along with the Excavated Collections, the Museum also holds a large collection of photographs and notes that document archeological sites and artifacts researched by the BYU Anthropology Department. There are over 30,000 photographs that document the various sites and artifacts found in Southern Mexico and Utah. Field notes from expeditions and digs conducted by the BYU Anthropology Department are also available from as early as the 1930s.

}}'''''Bury Me Standing: The Gypsies and Their Journey''''' is a best-selling non-fiction book on the lives of the [[Romani people]] by the American-Uruguayan writer [[Isabel Fonseca]] published in 1995. Fonseca lived and traveled with the Gypsies of Bulgaria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the former Yugoslavia, Romania and Albania for four years to write the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maslin|first1=Janet|title=A Stranger in the Land of Paradox|journal=The New York Times|date=October 25, 1995|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/09/bsp/bury.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title "Bury me standing" comes from a proverb which describes the plight of the Gypsies: "Bury me standing. I've been on my knees all my life."

The book is organized in eight chapters and contains black and white photographs and maps.&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca, Isabel "''Bury Me Standing''" Random House. Inc., New York. 1995. Vintage {{ISBN|0-679-73743-X}} ({{ISBN|0-679-40678-6}}). 322 pages including its index. Note: The original hardcover was published by Knopf Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13105">There have been various '''classification schemes for [[Languages of Asia#Southeast Asian languages|Southeast Asian languages]]''' (see the articles for the respective language families).

==Language families==
The five established major language families are:
*'''[[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]]'''
*'''[[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]'''
*'''[[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]]'''
*'''[[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]]'''
*'''[[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]]'''

==Isolates and small families==
A number of language groups in [[Arunachal Pradesh]] traditionally considered to be [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] ([[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]) may in fact constitute independent language families or isolates ([[Roger Blench]] 2011). (See [[Language isolates and independent language families in Arunachal]].)

*Potential [[language isolates and independent language families in Arunachal]]: [[Digaro languages|Digaro]], [[Hrusish languages|Hrusish]] (including the [[Miji languages]]&lt;ref name="Blench2015"&gt;Blench, Roger. 2015. [https://www.academia.edu/12657496/The_Mijiic_languages_distribution_dialects_wordlist_and_classification ''The Mijiic languages: distribution, dialects, wordlist and classification'']. m.s.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Midzu languages|Midzu]], [[Puroik language|Puroik]], [[Siangic languages|Siangic]], and [[Kho-Bwa languages|Kho-Bwa]]
*The two [[Andamanese languages|Andamanese]] language families: [[Great Andamanese languages|Great Andamanese]] and [[Ongan languages|Ongan]]
*[[Language isolate]]s and languages with isolate [[substratum|substrata]] of Southeast Asia: [[Kenaboi language|Kenaboi]], [[Enggano language|Enggano]], and the [[Philippine Negrito languages]] [[Manide language|Manide]] and [[Umiray Dumagat language|Umiray Dumagat]]

==Macrofamilies==
[[File:Dené-Caucasian.JPG|thumb|400px|The Dené–Caucasian proposal]]
Several [[macrofamily]] schemes have been proposed for linking multiple language families of Southeast Asia. None of these proposals is yet accepted by mainstream comparative linguistics, though research into higher-level relationships among these languages has gained some renewed scholarly interest over the last three decades; the various hypotheses are still under investigation, and the validity of each has yet to be resolved.&lt;ref name=vanDriem&gt;{{Cite journal |last=van Driem|first=George |author-link=George van Driem |year=2008 |title=To which language family does Chinese belong, or what’s in a name?|journal=''In Sanchez-Mazas, Alicia; Blench, Roger; Ross, Malcolm D.; Peiros, Ilia and Marie Lin, eds.'' Past Human Migrations in East Asia: Matching Archaeology, Linguistics and Genetics |pp=219–253 |location=London and New York |publisher=Routledge |url=http://himalayanlanguages.org/files/driem/pdfs/2008Whatsinaname.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Austro-Tai]] links the Austronesian and Kra–Dai languages. Several current scholars, including [[Laurent Sagart]], [[Stanley Starosta]], [[Weera Ostapirat]] and [[Lawrence Reid]],&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid, Lawrence A. (2006). "Austro-Tai Hypotheses". pp.&amp;nbsp;609–610 in Keith Brown (editor in chief), ''The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics'', 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt; accept or theorize a close relationship between these families, but the specifics of the relationship remain unclear. Multiple models of the internal branching of Austro-Tai have been put forward, and Austro-Tai has been incorporated as a subgroup within some larger macrofamily schemes, e.g. in Starosta's ''East Asian'' as well as in Sagart's model of Austronesian (see below), both of which regard Kra–Dai as a subfamily within Austronesian. A few versions of Austro-Tai have included [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] and/or the isolate [[Ainu language|Ainu]] as well, though these have not been met with as much acceptance.

* Miao–Dai (Kosaka 2002) is a hypothesis for a family including Miao–Yao (Hmong–Mien) and Kra–Dai.&lt;ref name="Kosaka"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kosaka |first=Ryuichi |title=On the affiliation of Miao-Yao and Kadai: Can we posit the Miao-Dai family? |journal=Mon-Khmer Studies |volume=32 |pages=71–100 |year=2002 |url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/kosaka2002affiliation.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sino-Austronesian languages|Sino-Austronesian]] (Sagart 2004, 2005) links Austro-Tai (''Austronesian'') with Sino-Tibetan (''Tibeto-Burman'').

* [[Austric languages|Austric]] links all of the major language families of Southeast Asia apart from Sino-Tibetan. Several variants of the Austric hypothesis have been proposed since it took shape with [[Paul K. Benedict]]'s proposal (1942). Some of these also incorporate Japonic, Korean and/or Ainu. One version called the "Greater Austric" hypothesis ([[John D. Bengtson|Bengtson]] 1996) includes Ainu as well as [[Nihali]], a language isolate of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bengtson |first=John |author-link=John Bengtson |title=The "Greater Austric" Hypothesis |year=2010 |url=http://jdbengt.net/articles/Austric.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The "Proto-Asian hypothesis" or "Austro-Asian" (Larish 2006) argues for lexical evidence of relationship among all of the languages typically included in Austric as well as Japanese–Korean.&lt;ref&gt;Larish, Michael D. 2006. [http://www.philippines-languages.sil.org/ical/papers/larish-proto_asian.pdf Possible Proto-Asian Archaic Residue and the Statigraphy of Diffusional Cumulation in Austro-Asian Languages]. Paper presented at the Tenth International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics, 17–20 January 2006, Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sino-Austronesian languages#Starosta (2005)|East Asian]] (Starosta 2005) covers all of these families as well as Sino-Tibetan. It posits Austronesian (including Kra–Dai) as the most divergent branch, coordinate with a primary branch ''Sino-Tibetan–Yangzian'' which links Sino-Tibetan with a clade called ''Yangzian'' (or ''Yangtzean''), named for the [[Yangtze]] river, which includes Austroasiatic and Hmong–Mien.

* In a different direction, the [[Dené–Caucasian languages|Dené–Caucasian]] hypothesis links Sino-Tibetan to languages of Siberia ([[Dene–Yeniseian]]) and the Caucasus ([[North Caucasian languages|North Caucasian]] or [[Macro-Caucasian languages|Macro-Caucasian]]). On the basis of [[lexicostatistics]], [[Sergei Starostin]] additionally hypothesized an even larger [[Dené–Daic]] macrofamily which incorporates both Dené–Caucasian and Austric as primary branches.

Genetic similarities between the peoples of East and Southeast Asia have led some{{who|date=October 2018}} to speculate about "[[Haplogroup O-M175#Language families and genes|Haplogroup O languages]]".

[[File:Pooh sticks bridge.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Poohsticks]] Bridge in [[Ashdown Forest]], an area of common land.]]
'''Common land'''  is land owned collectively by a number of persons, or by one person, but over which other people have certain traditional rights, such as to allow their livestock to graze upon it, to collect wood, or to cut turf for fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/landscape/protection/historiccultural/commonland/default.aspx Natural England].&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who has a right in, or over, common land jointly with another or others is called a '''commoner'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/commoner |title=Commoner |last=Anon |publisher=Farlex Inc |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article deals mainly with '''common land''' in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]]. Although the extent there is much reduced due to [[enclosure]] of common land from the millions of acres that existed until the 17th century, a considerable amount of common land still exists, particularly in upland areas, and there are over 7,000 registered commons in England alone.&lt;ref name="callander"&gt;{{harvnb|Callander|1987|p=???}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls DEFRA Database of registered common land in England]&lt;/ref&gt;

Common land or former common land is usually referred to as a '''common'''; for instance, [[Clapham Common]] or [[Mungrisdale Common]].

Originally in medieval [[England]] the common was an integral part of the [[manor]], and was thus part of the [[estate in land|estate]] held by the lord of the manor under a feudal grant from the Crown or a superior peer, who in turn held his land from the Crown which owned all land. This manorial system, founded on feudalism, granted rights of land use to different classes. These would be ''[[appurtenant]]'' rights,&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/appurtenant Legal dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; that is the ownership of rights belonged to tenancies of particular plots of land held within a [[manor]]. A commoner would be the person who, for the time being, was the occupier of a particular plot of land. Some rights of common were said to be ''[[easement|in gross]]'', that is, they were unconnected with tenure of land.  This was more usual in regions where commons are more extensive, such as in the high ground of Northern England or on the [[the Fens|Fens]], but also included many [[village green]]s across England and Wales. Most land with appurtenant commons rights is adjacent to the common or even surrounded by it, but in a few cases it may be some considerable distance away.

Historically [[Manorial court]]s defined the details of many of the rights of common allowed to manorial tenants, and such rights formed part of the [[copyhold]] tenancy whose terms were defined in the manorial court roll.

Example rights of common are:

* [[Pasture]]. Right to pasture cattle, horses, sheep or other animals on the common land.  The most widespread right.
* Piscary. Right to fish.
* [[Turbary]]. Right to take sods of turf for fuel.
* Common in the Soil. This is a general term used for rights to extract minerals such as sands, gravels, marl, walling stone and lime from common land.
* Mast or [[pannage]]. Right to turn out pigs for a period in autumn to eat mast ([[beech]] mast, acorns and other nuts).
* [[Estovers]]. Right to take sufficient wood for the commoner's house or holding; usually limited to smaller trees, bushes (such as [[gorse]]) and fallen branches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newforestexplorersguide.co.uk/sitefolders/commoning/marl%20turbary%20sheep/marl%20turbary%20sheep%20page.html New Forest explorers guide].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://direct.gov.uk/en/HomeAndCommunity/Planning/LandAndPropertyDevelopment/DG_10026177 UK government].&lt;/ref&gt;

On most commons, rights of [[pasture]] and [[pannage]] for each commoner are tightly defined by number and type of animal, and by the time of year when certain rights could be exercised.  For example, the occupier of a particular cottage might be allowed to graze fifteen [[cattle]], four [[horse]]s, [[pony|ponies]] or [[donkey]]s, and fifty [[geese]], whilst the numbers allowed for their neighbours would probably be different.  On some commons (such as the [[New Forest]] and adjoining commons), the rights are not limited by numbers, and instead a ''marking fee'' is paid each year for each animal ''turned out''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verderers.org.uk/rights.html Forest rights].&lt;/ref&gt; However, if excessive use was made of the common, for example, in overgrazing, a common would be ''stinted'',&lt;ref&gt;Susan Jane Buck Cox - "No tragedy on the Commons" Journal of Environmental Ethics, Vol 7, Spring 1985 [http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3113/buck_NoTragedy.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, a limit would be put on the number of animals each commoner was allowed to graze. These regulations were responsive to demographic and economic pressure. Thus rather than let a common become degraded, access was restricted even further.

The Lord of the Manor must only exercise his rights so far as to leave a "sufficiency" of resource for commoners. This was at Issue in 1889 when the Lord of the Manor and owner of Banstead Downs and Heath, a Mr Hartopp, exacavated gravel and threatened to reduce the available pasture.  The meaning of sufficiency was challenged in court, Expert winesses stated that the grazing capacity was 1200 animals, the commoners rights totalled 1440 animals, and 600 animals were normally turned out. It was decided sufficiency was whether enough grazing would be available for all the animals that could be turned out. The judgement was that "The Lord is bound to leave pasture enough to satisfy the commoners rights whether such rights are to be exercised or not". Commoners also have the right to "peaceful enjoyment" of their rights, so that they cannot be hindered by the Lord of the Manor. This was first proposed in 1500 and became case law in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;A guide to the Law of Commons. Ian Campbell LLB. Open Spaces Society 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of common==

===Pasture commons===
[[Pasture]] commons are those where the primary right is to pasture [[livestock]]. In the uplands, they are largely [[moorland]], on the coast they may be [[salt marsh]], [[sand dune]]s or [[cliff]]s, and on inland lowlands they may be [[downland]], [[grassland]], [[heathland]] or [[wood pasture]], depending on the soil and history. These habitats are often of very high [[nature conservation]] value, because of their very long continuity of management extending in some cases over many hundreds of years. In the past, most pasture commons would have been grazed by mixtures of cattle, sheep and ponies (often also geese).  The modern survival of grazing on pasture commons over the past century is uneven.&lt;ref name="Impacts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bournemouth.ac.uk/cceec/impactsofenvironmentalchange/impacts_of_grazing.html |title=Impacts of grazing on lowland heathland |publisher=[[Bournemouth University]] |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arable and haymeadow commons===
Surviving commons are almost all pasture, but in earlier times, [[arable land|arable]] farming and [[hay]]making were significant, with strips of land in the [[Open field system|common arable fields]] and common haymeadows assigned annually by [[Sortition|lot]].  When not in use for those purposes, such commons were [[graze]]d.  Examples include the common arable fields around the village of [[Laxton, Nottinghamshire#Open Fields|Laxton]] in Nottinghamshire, and a common meadow at [[North Meadow, Cricklade]].

===Lammas rights===
''Lammas rights'' entitled commoners to pasture following the harvest, between [[Lammas]] day, 12 August ([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]), to 6 April, even if they did not have other rights to the land. Such rights sometimes had the effect of preventing enclosure and building development on agricultural land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Evelyn |last=Pritchard |title=The Historical Background |year=2000 |editor-first=Leonard |editor-last=Chave |work=Ham and Petersham at 2000 |publisher=Ham Amenities Group |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enclosure and decline==
{{main article|Enclosure}}
Most of the medieval common land of England was lost due to enclosure. In English social and economic history, '''enclosure''' or '''inclosure''' is the process which ends traditional rights such as [[mowing]] [[meadow]]s for [[hay]], or [[grazing]] [[livestock]] on common land formerly held in the [[open field system]]. Once enclosed, these uses of the land become restricted to the owner, and it ceases to be land for the use of commoners.  In [[England and Wales]] the term is also used for the process that ended the ancient system of [[Tillage|arable farming]] in [[open field system|open fields]]. Under enclosure, such land is fenced (''enclosed'') and ''deeded'' or ''entitled'' to one or more owners. The process of enclosure began to be a widespread feature of the English agricultural landscape during the 16th century. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to large areas of rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small residual parcels of land in the lowlands.

Enclosure could be accomplished by buying the ground rights and all common rights to accomplish exclusive rights of use, which increased the value of the land.  The other method was by passing laws causing or forcing enclosure, such as Parliamentary enclosure.  The latter process of enclosure was sometimes accompanied by force, resistance, and bloodshed, and remains among the most controversial areas of [[agricultural]] and [[economics|economic]] [[history]] in England.

Enclosure is considered one of the causes of the [[British Agricultural Revolution]].  Enclosed land was under control of the farmer who was free to adopt better farming practices.  There was widespread agreement in contemporary accounts that profit making opportunities were better with enclosed land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overton|1996|pp=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following enclosure, crop yields and livestock output increased while at the same time productivity increased enough to create a surplus of labour.  The increased labour supply is considered one of the factors facilitating the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Agricultural Revolution in England: The transformation if the agrarian economy 1500–1850 |last=Overton |first=Mark |authorlink= |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-521-56859-3 |pages= |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the era of enclosure, there was relatively little common land remaining of value. Some residual commoners remained, until such as after the Second World War, lowland commons became neglected because commoners could find better-paid work in other sectors of the economy. As a result, they largely stopped exercising their rights, and relatively few commoners exist today.

==Modern use==
Much common land is still used for its original purpose. The right to graze domestic stock is by far the most extensive commoners right registered, and its ongoing use contributes significantly to agricultural and rural economies.  Rights to graze sheep are registered on 53% of the Welsh and 16% of the English commons. Cattle are registered on 35% of Welsh and 20% of English commons, whilst horses and ponies are registered on 27% of Welsh and 13% of English commons. In some cases rights to graze goats, geese and ducks are registered, whilst in others the type of livestock is not specified. These figures relate to the number of common land units, and due to discrepancies in the registers and large numbers of small commons with no rights in England, the apparent distinction between Wales and England may be exaggerated.&lt;ref name="Foundation for common land"&gt;[http://www.foundationforcommonland.org.uk/ Foundation for common land]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, despite the diverse legal and historical origins of commons, they are managed through a community of users, comprising those who hold rights together with the owner(s) of the soil. Such communities generally require joint working to integrate all interests, with formal or informal controls and collaborative understandings, often coupled with strong social traditions and local identity.&lt;ref name="Foundation for common land" /&gt;

However, 26% of commons in Wales, and as many as 65% in England, have no common rights shown on the registers. Such areas are derived from [[manorial waste|wastes of manors]], where rights probably existed formerly.&lt;ref name="Foundation for common land" /&gt; When such open habitats are no longer grazed they revert to scrub and then dense woodland, losing the grassy or heathland vegetation which may have occupied the land continuously for many centuries. In 2007 [[Ashdown Forest]], the Sussex heathland which was the setting for the [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] stories, became the centre of a dispute between some local residents and the Forest's governing body, the Board of Conservators, which is responsible for administering the Forest's {{convert|2,400|ha}} of common land. The Conservators wished to restore the Forest's landscape to one that predominantly consisted of heathland—its defining characteristic until the mid-twentieth century, but something that was in danger of being lost after the Second World War as a result of the advance of woodland into traditional heathland areas when, as one commentator stated..

{{quote|...returning soldiers gave up trying to scratch a living out of the forest. Whereas once hundreds of commoners used the wood and heath—their livestock obliging by chewing down young tree shoots—today there is only one commercial grazer.{{sfn|Brown|2007}} }}

The Conservators were forced to intervene to stem the invasion of trees, scrub and bracken that threatened the ecologicially precious heathlands, cutting down saplings, removing scrub and mowing the bracken. Some residents complained that the results looked like a First World War battle field. This is not a problem restricted to this common, but according to Jonathan Brown writing in the Independent on 21 April 2007 "similar debates are raging between locals and the authorities at other heathland areas in the New Forest and Surrey".{{sfn|Brown|2007}}

In 2008 the Foundation for Common Land was created in the UK to  try to enhance the understanding and protection of commons.&lt;ref&gt;[Bathe, Graham "Common Land" .Pitkin. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governing law in England and Wales==
The legal position concerning common land has been confused, but recent legislation has sought to remedy this and remove the legal uncertainties so that commons can be better used and protected.

Most commons are based on ancient rights under British [[common law]], which pre-date [[statute]]s passed by the [[Parliament of England]]. The exact rights which apply to individual commons were in some cases documented, but more often were based on long-held traditions. A major reform began in 1965, with a national register of common land which recorded the land ownership and the rights of any commoners, and two other important statutes have followed.

Owners of land in general have all the rights of exclusive ownership, to use the land as they wish. However, for common land the owner's rights are restricted, and other people known as commoners have certain rights over the land.  The landowner may retain other rights to the land, such as rights to minerals and large timber, and to any common rights left unexercised by the commoners. The commoners will  continue to exercise their rights, or have a document which describes their rights, which may be part of the deeds of another property. A number of commoners still exercise rights, for example, there are 500&amp;nbsp;practising commoners in the [[New Forest]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://newforestcommoners.co.uk/ New Forest commoners]&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a federation of commoners in [[Cumbria]].&lt;ref&gt;Federation of Cumbrian Commoners website – retrieved Nov 2014 [Cumbria http://www.cumbriacommoners.org.uk/commons-councils]&lt;/ref&gt;  In many cases commons have no existing commoners, the rights having been neglected.

===Erection of Cottages Act 1588===
There  was a belief that if an Englishman or woman could—between sunrise and sunset in a single day—build a house on common land, raise the roof over their head and light a fire in the hearth, then they would have the right of undisturbed possession.&lt;ref name=Harrison135&gt;Harrison. The Common People. p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The belief—sometimes called "keyhole tenure", and which persisted as recently as the early 20th century—was actually a fallacy, but to stop landless peasants unlawfully squatting on commons, an act known as the [[Erection of Cottages Act 1588]] (31 Eliz c. 7, long title "An Act against the erecting and maintaining of Cottages"), was introduced.&lt;ref name=Harrison135 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lure of the New Forest|first=Elizabeth|last=Croly|location=Richmond|publisher=Mills &amp; Boon|year=1925|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Law Notes, Vol.43|first=Abraham|last=Williams|location=London|publisher=Reeves &amp; Turner|year=1924|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=statute664&gt;Basket. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2KZFAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA664 Statutes at Large.] p. 664&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commons Act 1876===
Under the Commons Act 1876 some 36 commons in England and Wales were regulated. The act also enabled the confirmation of Orders providing for the inclosure of common land or common fields.

===Commons Act 1899===
The Commons Act 1899 provides a mechanism of enabling district councils and National Park authorities to manage commons where their use for exercise and recreation is the prime consideration and where the owner and commoners do not require a direct voice in the management, or where the owner cannot be found. There are at least 200 schemes of management made under the 1899 act.

===The Law of Property Act 1925===
The [[Law of Property Act 1925]], which still forms the core of English property law, has two provisions for common land:
* Section 193 gave the right of the public to "air and exercise" on Metropolitan commons and those in pre-1974 urban districts and boroughs. This constituted about one fifth of the commons, but the 1925 Act did not give this right to commons in essentially rural areas (although some urban districts had remarkably rural extent, such as the Lakes Urban District), which had to wait for the 2000 CROW Act.
* Section 194 restricted the inclosure of commons, which would now require Ministerial consent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/contents Law of Property Act 1925]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commons Registration Act 1965===
The UK government regularised the definitions of common land with the [[Commons Registration Act 1965]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1965/cukpga_19650064_en_1 Commons Registration Act 1965], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; which established a register of common land.

Not all commons have owners, but all common land by definition is registered under 1965 Commons registration Act, along with the rights of any commoners if they still exist. The registration authorities are the County Councils, and when there is no ownership, a local council, such as a [[parish councils in England|parish council]] is normally given guardianship by vesting the property under the Act (section 8).

An online database of registered common land was compiled by DEFRA in 1992–93 as part of a survey of the condition and wildlife of commons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls DEFRA Database of registered common land in England compiled 1992–93]&lt;/ref&gt; The official up to date Registers of common land are held by the Commons Registration Authorities.

The following registration information is held:&lt;ref&gt;Cumbria CC website 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Land Section'''

This includes a description of the land, who applied to register the land, and when the land became finally registered. There are also related plans which show the boundaries of the land.

* '''Rights Section'''

This includes a description of the rights of common (e.g. a right to graze a certain number of sheep), the area of common over which the right is exercisable, the name of the holder of the right and whether the right is attached to land in the ownership of the holder of the right (the commoner) or is a right held in gross i.e. unattached to land.

* '''Ownership Section'''

This includes details of the owner(s) of the common land. Entries in this section however, are not held to be conclusive.

Unfortunately, numerous inconsistencies and irregularities remained, mainly because a period of only 3 years was given for registration submissions. However, there is there is now an opportunity to clear these up under the 2006 Act, and to add land omitted under the 1965 act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/protected/commonland/court.htm Defra], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW)===
Other than for those commons covered by the Law of Property Act 1925, the Commons Act 1899 and certain other statutes, the public did not have the right to use or enjoy common land if they were not a commoner. However, the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]] gave the public the [[Freedom to roam]] freely on all registered common land in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/access/openaccess/default.aspx |publisher=Natural England |title=Open Access land |accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new rights were introduced region by region through England and Wales, with completion in 2005. Maps showing accessible areas have been produced, and are available online as "open access maps" produced by Natural England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openaccess.naturalengland.org.uk/wps/portal/oasys/maps/MapSearch Open access maps at Natural England]&lt;/ref&gt; Commons are included in the public access land now shown on the [[Ordnance Survey]] Explorer Maps.

===Commons Act 2006===
The Commons Act 2006 is an important recent piece of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/26/section/15 Commons act 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act:

* Enables commons to be managed more sustainably by commoners and landowners working together through commons councils with powers to regulate grazing and other agricultural activities
* Provides better protection for common land and greens – this includes reinforcing existing protections against abuse, encroachment and unauthorised development
* Recognises that the protection of common land has to be proportionate to the harm caused and that some specified works can be carried out without the need for consent
* Requires commons registration authorities to bring their registers up-to-date by recording past changes affecting the registers during a ‘transitional period’, and to keep the registers up-to-date by recording new changes affecting the registers – commons registration authorities will have new powers to correct many of the mistakes in the registers
* Sets out new, clearer criteria for the registration of town or village greens
* Prohibits the severance of rights of common grazing, preventing commoners from selling, leasing or letting their rights away from the property to which rights are attached,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/common-land-management-protection-and-registering-to-use HMG Guide to the 2006 act]&lt;/ref&gt; though temporary severance of such rights is permitted &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/2145/contents/made The Commons (Severance of Rights) (England) Order 2006][http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2014/219/contents/made The Commons (Severance of Rights) (Wales) Order 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; for renewable terms of up to two years (in England) and five years (in Wales).&lt;ref&gt;[Natural England "Commons Toolkit" NE 285]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several hundred square kilometres of ‘waste land’ that was provisionally registered under the Commons Registration Act 1965 was not, in fact, finally registered. As a consequence, it ceased to be recognised as common land. A partial remedy for this defect in the earlier legislation is provided by the Commons Act 2006. Under Schedule 2(4) to the Act, applications that failed to achieve final registration under the 1965 Act may, in certain circumstances, be reconsidered – offering, in effect, a second chance for the land to be confirmed (‘re-registered’) as common. Land that is re-registered in this way will enjoy the special legal protection afforded to common land. It will also become subject in due course to the public right of access introduced by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000; or depending on location, may qualify as a section 193 ‘urban’ common (in which case, it would also be subject to a right of access for horse-riders).&lt;ref&gt;Open Spaces Society website retrieved Nov 2014 – section on the Commons Act 2006 {{cite web |url=http://www.oss.org.uk/what-we-do/commons/the-commons-act-2006/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127125452/http://www.oss.org.uk/what-we-do/commons/the-commons-act-2006/ |archivedate=27 November 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fencing===
[[File:Wimbledon Windmill.jpg|thumb| The [[Wimbledon Windmill|windmill]] on [[Wimbledon Common]].]]
The act of transferring resources from the commons to purely private ownership is known as ''[[enclosure]]'', or (especially in formal use, and in place names) ''Inclosure''. The [[Inclosure Acts]] were a series of private Acts of Parliament, mainly from about 1750 to 1850, which enclosed large areas of common, especially the arable and haymeadow land and the better pasture land.

The maintenance of fences around a common is the responsibility of the occupiers of the adjacent enclosed land, not (as it would be with enclosed land) the responsibility of the owners of the grazed livestock.  This can lead to difficulties where not all adjacent occupiers maintain their fences properly. However the fencing of land within a registered common is not allowed, as this is a form of enclosure and denies use of the land to others.

A celebrated landmark case of unauthorised fencing of a common was in 1866 by Lord Brownlow who illegally enclosed 434 acres of Berkhamsted Common to add to his [[Ashridge Estate]]. Brownlow had failed to buy out the commoners, so resorted to this action. A public outcry followed, and the Commons Preservation Society found a champion in [[Augustus Smith (politician)|Augustus Smith]] who had the inclination and the money to act, and himself held commons rights. Smith hired 120 navvies armed with hammers, chisels and crowbars, who on the night of 6 March 1866, under the aegis of the newly formed Commons Preservation Society (now the [[Open Spaces Society]]), felled to the ground two miles of iron railings. Soon after, local people flocked in. Lord Brownlow took action against Augustus Smith and the court case lasted until 1870 when it ended with the complete vindication of Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern commons: a protected open space?|first=Kate|last=Ashbrook|work=Open Spaces Society|date=July 2013|url=http://contestedcommons.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Kate-Ashbrook.pdf|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controls on development===
Development of common land is strictly controlled. The government states that common land should be open and accessible to the public, and the law restricts the kind of works that can be carried out on commons. HM Planning Inspectorate is responsible for determining applications under the 2006 Act regarding common land in England, and several other pieces of legislation regarding commons and greens. All applications are determined on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).&lt;ref name="UK planning portal"&gt;[http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/permission/responsibilities/beforeyoustart/otherpermissions/commonland UK planning portal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under section 38 of the Commons Act 2006, you need consent to carry out any restricted works on land registered as common land under the Commons Registration Act 1965. Restricted works are any that
prevent or impede access to or over the land. They include fencing, buildings, structures, ditches, trenches, embankments and other works, where the effect of those works is to prevent or impede access. They also include, in every case, new solid surfaces, such as for a new car park or access road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/countryside/commonland/guidance Guidance on development on common land]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boards of Conservators and Commons Councils===
Some commons are managed by [[Conservators|Boards of Conservators]] for the wider public benefit. However, for areas where these are not established, or an improved system is required, the Commons Act 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/ukpga_20060026_en_1 Commons Act 2006], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; provides for the establishment of Commons Councils to manage common land.&lt;ref name="DEFRA"&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/protected-areas/common-land/manage.htm How is Common Land managed?], Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Standard Constitution Regulations relating to commons councils were formally approved in April 2010, and Commons Councils are most likely to be useful where they can improve current management practices.  This may be where commons are in agricultural use, but where it can be difficult to reach agreement on collective management. Commons Councils are voluntary and can be established only where there is substantial support among those with interests in the land, such as; the Commoners  (especially those who actively exercise their rights); owners and other legal interests.

Commons Councils enable decisions to be made by majority voting, so relieving the burden of trying to reach unanimous decisions.  They will have the power to make rules about agricultural activities, the management of vegetation, and the exercise of common rights, which are binding on all those with interests on a common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cumbriacommoners.org.uk/commons-councils Federation of Cumbrian Commoners]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roadways===
[[File:Enclosure Road, Lazonby.jpg|thumb|A parliamentary enclosure road near Lazonby in Cumbria. The roads were made as straight as possible, and the boundaries much wider than a cart width to reduce the ground damage of driving sheep and cattle.&lt;ref name="whyte" /&gt;]]
Commons are often crossed by unfenced public roads, and this leads to another problem on modern pasture commons where grazing survives (or is to be reintroduced).  Historically, the roads would have been [[cart]]-tracks, and there would have been no conflict between their [[horse]]-drawn (or [[ox]]-drawn) traffic and the pastured animals, and no great difficulty if pastured animals wandered off the common along the roads.  However, these roads now have fast motorised traffic which does not mix safely with animals.  To continue (or restore) grazing, such roads may need fencing or at least blocking at the edge of the common with [[cattle grid]]s — however fencing a common is reminiscent of the process of enclosure, historically fatal to its survival, and permission for fencing on a common is a strictly controlled process within the UK planning system.&lt;ref name="UK planning portal" /&gt;

Public roads through enclosed common land were made to an accepted width between boundaries. In the late eighteenth century this was at least {{convert|60|ft}}, but from the 1790s this was decreased to {{convert|40|ft}}, and later {{convert|30|ft}} as the normal maximum width. The reason for these wide roads to was to prevent excessive churning of the road bed, and allow easy movement of flocks and herds of animals.&lt;ref name="whyte"&gt;Transforming Fell and Valley, Ian Whyte. Published by Centre for North West regional Studies, University of Lancaster 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland and Sweden ==
A '''partition unit''' is a [[corporation]] that owns common land. In this case, the land is not state-owned or in joint-ownership under a trust, but is owned by a definite partition unit, a legal [[partnership]] whose partners are the participating individual landowners. Common lands and waterways owned by a partition unit were created by an agreement where certain land was reserved for the common use of all adjacent landowners. For the most part, this was due to the Great Partition (Swedish: [[:sv:storskiftet|storskiftet]], Finnish: [[:fi:isojako|isojako]]), which started in 1757 and was largely complete by the 1800s. Earlier, the land of a village was divided into narrow stripes of farmland for each to own, with the remainder commonly owned, and work on the land was collective. In the Great Partition, villages were organized as corporations termed partition units (Swedish: [[:sv:skifteslag|skifteslag]], Finnish: [[:fi:jakokunta|jakokunta]]), and land was divided into large chunks that were divided among the households (commoners) for individual cultivation and habitation. Land or waterways that remained undivided was kept by the partition unit as commons, owned by the partition unit. Later, [[Gustaf III]] claimed the yet unclaimed forest for the Crown – this was the origin of the large forest holdings of the state in Sweden and Finland. Today, partition units are a common way of owning waterways.

==Scotland==
Commoning has probably existed in Scotland for over a millennium. However, there is no modern legislation relating to commons which formally identifies the extent of common land or clarifies the full range of rights. The right of turbary – the ability to cut peat as fuel – clearly exists in large parts of Scotland, whilst the scale of such rights, and the extent to which they are utilised, remain unknown. The main work undertaken on Scottish commons concerns grazing, using a pragmatic definition, where such commons were defined as pastures with multiple grazing rights and/or multiple graziers.&lt;ref name="Foundation for common land" /&gt;

There are seven main historic types of common land in [[Scotland]],&lt;ref name="callander" /&gt; some of which have similarities to common land in England and Wales.

===Commonties===
The overwhelming majority of areas of common land in lowland Scotland and the [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] fringes were ''commonties''. A commonty is an area of land where the rights of [[Real property|property]] or use are shared by two or more neighbouring (though not necessarily adjacent) landowners. They are not therefore truly 'common' land in the sense that anyone can use them, and this distinction meant that it was often very easy for commonties to be divided between landowners after a series of Acts permitting this were passed by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in the 17th century, most notably the 1695 Act for the Division of Commonties. As a result, the number of commonties declined very rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries.

===Common mosses===
Common mosses were areas of [[bog]] where the right to dig [[peat]] for fuel were shared by neighbouring landowners. They are therefore similar to commonties and most commonties included a common moss. However the difficulties of dividing such wet areas meant that they were left out of many commonty divisions and many common mosses may still survive, un-noticed because of the decline of peat-cutting.

===Run rig===
{{Main article|Run rig}}
[[File:Buchansrigs.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ridge and furrow|
Rig and furrow marks]] at Buchans Field, [[National Museum of Rural Life|Wester Kittochside]], an area of Scottish common land]]
Run rig is a system of agriculture involving the cultivation of adjacent, narrow strips of raised land (rigs). Traditionally adjacent rigs would be used by different farmers and the rigs were periodically re-allocated between them. The system was common throughout Scotland until the 18th century, but survived longer in the Western [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], where runrig was often associated with an adjacent area of common hill grazing which was also shared by the same farmers as the runrig.

===Scattalds===
Scattalds are unique to [[Shetland]] and are based on [[udal law]], rather than the [[feudal]] law that predominated in the rest of Scotland. However, Scattalds are very similar to commonties and many were divided under the same 1695 Act that allowed for the division of commonties.

===Crown Commons===
Crown Commons were areas of land held directly by the crown and therefore the common rights that could be used were rights of use rather than rights of property. Unlike commonties, the rights to use crown commons (for example for grazing livestock) were available to anyone, not just the neighbouring landowners. There are no crown commons left in Scotland; those that survived into the 20th century were taken over by the [[Crown Estate]].

===Greens and loans===
Greens were small areas of common land near a settlement where livestock could be kept overnight, markets held and other communal activities carried out. Sometimes they were adjacent to [[drovers' road]]s near river crossing points or overnight accommodation. Most were genuinely common land with only the Crown holding any title to them. A loan was a common route through private property allowing access to an area of common land or other public place. As the traditional uses of greens and loans declined, they were often absorbed by the neighbouring landowners.

===Burgh commons===
Burgh commons were areas of common land where property rights or privileges of use were held by the [[burgh]] for their inhabitants. They could include any of the other six types of common land and were sometimes shared with landowners outside the burgh. By the early 19th century, most burgh commons had been appropriated by the wealthy landowners who dominated burgh councils, and very few have survived.

==United States==
{{see also|Open range|Range war|Sheep Wars}}
Common land, an English development, was used in many former British colonies, for example in Ireland and the United States. The North American colonies adopted the English laws in establishing their own commons. Famous examples include the [[Boston Common]] in Massachusetts and the [[New Haven Green]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], some of the oldest commons in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/places/new-haven-green.htm|title=New Haven Green (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13312">The [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]] of [[lacquerware]] prevents and mitigates deterioration or damage to objects made with [[lacquer]]. The two main types of lacquer are Asian, made with [[sap]] from the [[Urushi]] tree, and European, made with a variety of [[shellac]] and [[Resin|natural resins]]. Lacquer can be damaged by age, light, water, temperature, or damaged substrate.

Conservation treatments include dry cleaning, wet cleaning, consolidation and filling losses. Eastern cultures use Asian lacquer to repair damages and fill and consolidate losses. Western cultures typically use alternate materials that can be reversed with minimal risk to the original object.

== Production and History of Lacquer ==
Lacquer is a type of [[varnish]] or surface coating, which is diluted with [[solvent]] and applied in several coats to seal a substrate, hardening via a [[chemical reaction]] to create a seal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Lacquer|title=Lacquer - Wiki|website=www.conservation-wiki.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main categories of lacquer: [[Asia]]n lacquer and [[Europe]]an lacquer.

=== Asian Lacquer ===
[[File:Ryukyu Lacquer.jpg|thumb|Ryukyu Lacquer Production, Okinawa, Japan]]
Traditional Asian lacquer has been used for centuries&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bishopmuseum.org/research/pdf/cnsv-lacquer.pdf|title=Bishop Museum Art Conservation Handout: Lacquer|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is derived from [[sap]], prominently that from the Urushi tree; part of the [[sumac]] family grown throughout [[Japan]], [[China]] and [[Korea]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asianart.org/collections/conservation-of-asian-lacquer|title=Asian Art Museum {{!}} Conservation of Asian Lacquer|website=www.asianart.org|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sap from the tree contains a [[chemical compound]] called [[Urushiol|urishol]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;that hardens when exposed to [[humidity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fleming|first=Stuart|date=1987-01-01|title=SCIENCE SCOPE: Japanese Urushi: The Finishing Touch|jstor=41731914|journal=Archaeology|volume=40|issue=4|pages=62–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sap is processed to remove [[Impurity|impurities]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lacquer: Technology and conservation: A comprehensive guide to the technology and conservation of Asian and European lacquer.|last=Webb|first=Marianne|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2000|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of lacquerware involves a process of applying a ground layer,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-01/the-conservation-of-oriental-lacquer/|title=The Conservation of Oriental Lacquer|last=webmaster@vam.ac.uk|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Online Museum, Web Team,|website=www.vam.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; oftentimes lacquer mixed with other substances such as [[clay]] or a layer of [[Textile|fabric]], followed by many very thin layers of processed lacquer to a substrate, typically [[wood]], and allowing them to dry completely,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; then curing and [[polishing]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== European Lacquer ===
Developed in the [[17th century|17th Century]], European Lacquerware, or [[Japanning]], was influenced by the import of Asian lacquerware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kisluk-Grosheide|first=Danielle O.|date=1984-01-01|title=A Japanned Cabinet in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.2307/1512814|journal=Metropolitan Museum Journal|volume=19/20|pages=85–95|doi=10.2307/1512814|issn=0077-8958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanned objects are made with a variety of [[shellac]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urushi-kobo.com/conservation-restoration.html|title=URUSHI-KOBO in EUROPE - CONSERVATION/ RESTORATION|website=www.urushi-kobo.com|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and natural [[resin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-52/the-development-of-english-black-japanning-1620-1820/|title=The development of English black japanning 1620-1820|last=webmaster@vam.ac.uk|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Online Museum, Web Team,|website=www.vam.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agents of Deterioration ==

=== Age ===
When it is produced, lacquer is a very durable substance, both waterproof and [[Solubility|insoluble]]. With age, lacquer can begin to breakdown and deteriorate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[File:Black lacquer box from China, lacquer on wood with silver, 20th century, East-West Center.JPG|thumb|An example of Asian Lacquerware; a 
20th-century Chinese lacquer box.
]]

=== Light ===
Lacquerware is very sensitive to exposure to [[light]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which causes [[photodegradation]],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=COUEIGNOUX|first=CATHERINE|date=2009-01-01|title=AQUEOUS CLEANING OF PHOTODEGRADED EAST ASIAN LACQUER: A CASE STUDY|jstor=27784652|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=48|issue=1|pages=51–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; fading and discoloration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Water ===
Photodegraded lacquer is extremely sensitive to humidity and [[water]]. Exposure to water and other [[polar solvent]]s can cause blanching, whitening of the surface from the formation of [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Temperature ===
High temperatures along with moisture can cause [[Thermochromism|thermochromatic]] change to the lacquer surface.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webb|first=Marianne|date=1998-01-01|title=Methods and Materials for Filling Losses on Lacquer Objects|jstor=3179915|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=37|issue=1|pages=117–133|doi=10.2307/3179915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Damage to the Substrate ===
The supporting structure can be damaged or lost from the effects of expanding and contracting in changing [[Collections care|environmental conditions]], including temperature and humidity, from [[Museum integrated pest management|pest]] damage, or deterioration from age. The damaged support may cause warping, lifting or cracking of the lacquer coating.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Previous Restoration ===
Previous restoration such as fills and overpainting can degrade and potentially damage original surfaces over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/treatment-of-mazarin-chest/|title=A Collaborative Approach|last=webmaster@vam.ac.uk|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Online Museum, Web Team,|website=www.vam.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==

=== Preventive Conservation ===
[[Preventive conservation|Preventive Conservation]] measures can be used to avert damage to lacquerware caused by deterioration. Preventive methods may include limiting exposure to light to a maximum of 40 years at 100 [[lux]] or 80 years at 50 lux,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; maintaining stable temperature and humidity levels, using safe and proper art handling with gloves and proper art storage, per current professional [[museum]] standards such as those from the [[American Alliance of Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aam-us.org/resources/ethics-standards-and-best-practices/collections-stewardship|title=Museum Standards and Best Practices - Collections Stewardship|website=www.aam-us.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation Treatment ===
Conservation treatment methods vary depending on the individual object and the materials used in its production.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Asian lacquer and European lacquer have different [[Chemical property|chemical properties]], and therefore require different materials and techniques for treatment. Prior to conservation treatment, conservators and conservation scientists analyze and document the properties of the work to determine the best methods and materials for its treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/lacquers/|title=Characterization of European and Asian Lacquers|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional conservators use codes of ethics for best practices, such as those from the [[American Institute for Conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice#.Vx0XxjArI2w|title=Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice|website=www.conservation-us.org|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eastern and Western Techniques ====
Different conservation techniques are used to conserve Asian lacquerware in Eastern and Western cultures. Traditionally, Eastern cultures use Asian lacquer to repair damages and fill and consolidate losses.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Asian lacquer is [[Toxicity|toxic]] and requires training and expertise to use. The material is also not easily [[:wikt:reversibility|reversible]] nor readily available to attain for conservation use. Western cultures, less familiar with the techniques of producing, applying or curing lacquer, typically use alternate materials for conservation treatment, particularly those that can be reversed with minimal risk to the original object.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/aam_phase2/pdf_assets/files/000/000/208/original/Williams_2008_Conservation_of_Asian_Lacquer.pdf?1384300665|title=Conservation of Asian Lacquer Case Studies at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|last=Williams|first=Jane|date=2008|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Dry Cleaning =====
Dry cleaning is the process of removing dirt and grime from the surface of the object without the use of solvents. Tools used for dry cleaning of lacquerware can include soft brushes, microfiber cloths, cotton swabs, and fine celled absorbent sponges.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===== Wet Cleaning =====
Wet cleaning is the process of further removal of dirt, grime and residue from the surface of the object that is not successfully removed by dry cleaning. Testing of various solvents should be done prior to wet cleaning the surface of the object in order to prevent possible damage to or removal of the original lacquer surface.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Aqueous solution|Aqueous]] solvents with different [[PH]] levels will have varying levels of success in the removal of dirt and grime from the surface of the lacquer, and have various levels of risk of damaging the surface. This also depends on the condition of the object prior to cleaning. [[Nonpolar solvent|Nonpolar]] solvents are less likely to damage surfaces that have been photodegradad.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== Consolidation =====
Consolidation is the process of stabilizing lifting and cracked areas of lacquer to minimize further damage and loss.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Consolidants used can include Asian lacquer or other [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic]] or organic  [[adhesive]]s such as [[animal glue]] or [[Paraloid B-72]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Adhesives can be thinned with solvents in order to be wicked beneath layers of lifting lacquer or into cracks and allowed to dry while securing the loose area in place.

===== Filling Losses =====
Different types of fill materials are used for European and Asian lacquerware. Losses caused by damage to the lacquer surface can be structural or aesthetic. Losses should only be filled if the surrounding areas are stable, without potential of damage from the fill material. Trained Eastern conservators may choose to use Asian Lacquer as a fill for losses, while Western conservators may use alternate materials such as waxes, polyester resins and epoxy resins. Completed fills can then be inpainted to match the surrounding lacquer surface.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''Constitutional theory''' is an area of '''[[constitutional law]]''' that focuses on the underpinnings of constitutional government. It overlaps with [[legal theory]], [[constitutionalism]], [[philosophy of law]] and democratic theory. It is not limited by country or jurisdiction.

== United States ==

Constitutional theory in the [[United States]] is an academic discipline that focuses on the meaning of the United States [[Constitution]].  Its concerns include (but are not limited to) the historical, linguistic, sociological, ethical, and political aspects.

Much of constitutional theory is concerned with theories of [[judicial review]]. This is in part because ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', which established this judicial power in the early 19th century, has given the judiciary near-final authority on constitutional meaning.

Aside from judicial review, constitutional theory in general seeks to ask and answer the following questions:

*How should the Constitution be interpreted?

Although constitutional theory as a discipline has its precursors in ''[[The Federalist]]'' and [[Justice Story]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Constitution]]'', modern constitutional theory began with the publication of [[Alexander Bickel]]'s ''[[The Least Dangerous Branch]]''. (The title is an allusion to ''The Federalist'' No. 78, in which [[Alexander Hamilton]] wrote that the judiciary "will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution", because it has neither the sword (like the Executive) nor the purse (like the Legislature).  The book's primary (but not sole) contribution was to introduce the idea of the "[[countermajoritarian difficulty]]."  The idea expressed by the term countermajoritarian difficulty is that there is a tension between democratic government (as he defines it democratic government is majoritarian government) and judicial power.  If the judiciary—an unelected branch of government—can overturn popular legislation, then either there is a fundamental contradiction within the democratic system, or there is a tension that must be resolved by curbing judicial power.  (One of Bickel's solutions is for the Court to exercise "the [[passive virtues]]": that is, to decline to decide more than it has to decide.)

== German Rechtsstaat==
The Rechtsstaat doctrine (Legal state, State of Right, Constitutional state, constitutional government) was introduced in the latest works of the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) after US and French constitutions were adopted in the late 18th century.  Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of a country’s written [[constitution]]. This supremacy must create guarantees for implementation of his central idea:  a permanent peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness of its people and their prosperity.  Kant was basing his doctrine on none other but [[constitutionalism]] and [[constitutional government]].

Kant had thus formulated the main problem of constitutionalism, “The constitution of a [[State (polity)|state]] is eventually based on the morals of its citizens, which, in its turns, is based on the goodness of this constitution.”  Kant’s idea is the foundation for the constitutional theory of the twenty-first century. The Legal state concept is based on the ideas, discovered by Immanuel Kant, for example, in his Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals:
“The task of establishing a universal and permanent peaceful life is not only a part of theory of law within the framework of pure reason, but per se an absolute and ultimate goal. To achieve this goal, a state must become the community of a large number of people, living provided with legislative guarantees of their property rights secured by a common constitution. The supremacy of this constitution… must be derived a priori from the considerations for achievement of the absolute ideal in the most just and fair organization of people’s life under the aegis of public law.”.&lt;ref&gt;"Immanuel Kant", ''History of [[Political Philosophy]]'', edited by Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian legal state ==
The Russian legal system, borne out of transformations in the 19th Century under the [[judicial reform of Alexander II]], is based primarily upon the German legal tradition. It was from here that Russia borrowed a doctrine of Rechtsstaat, which literally translates as Legal State. The English most close analogue is «rule of law».&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Rechtsstaat  is a concept in continental European legal thinking, originally borrowed from German legal philosophy, which can be translated as “legal state” or "state of law", or "state of rights", "constitutional state" in which the exercise of governmental power is constrained by the law.  The Russian Legal state concept adopts the written constitution as a supreme law of the country (the rule of constitution).&lt;ref&gt;The former President of the [[International Bar Association]] Francis Neate wrote about links between Russian concept of the Legal state and British approach: “The [[Rule of Law]] is an English concept.  I am told that the equivalent in Russia, and possibly in other countries, is better translated as ‘Legal State’, or ‘a state governed by law’.  If the latter phrase is acceptable then surely we are talking about the same thing... The best way to determine whether or not we are talking about the same concept is to look at the essential characteristics of the Rule of Law and to determine whether or not they are similar to the essential characteristics of the ‘Legal State’.  This is what I propose to do.”, "The Rule of Law: Perspectives from Around the Globe", Editor: Francis Neate, London, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of “legal state” (“pravovoe gosudarstvo” in Russian) is a fundamental, but undefined, principle that appears in the very first dispositive provision of Russia’s [[Constitution of Russia|post-Communist constitution]]:  “The Russian Federation – Russia – constitutes a democratic federative legal state with a republican form of governance.”  Similarly, the very first dispositive provision of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] declares: “Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, legal state.”  The effort to give meaning to definition “Legal State” is anything but theoretical.

[[Valery Zorkin]], President of the [[Constitutional Court of Russia]], wrote in 2003:
“Becoming a legal state  has long been our ultimate goal, and we have certainly made serious progress in this direction over the past several years. 
However, no one can say now that we have reached this destination.  Such a Legal state simply cannot exist without a lawful and
just society.  Here, as in no other sphere of our life, the state reflects the level of maturity reached by society.".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform]", edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian concept of legal state adopted many segments of the [[constitutional economics]]. One of the founders of constitutional economics [[James M. Buchanan]], the 1986 recipient of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] argues that in the framework of constitutional government any governmental interventions and regulations have been based on three assumptions.
* First, every failure of the [[market economy]] to function smoothly and perfectly can be corrected by governmental intervention.
* Second, those holding political office and manning the bureaucracies are altruistic upholders of the public interest, unconcerned with their own personal economic well-being.
* And, third, changing the responsibilities of [[government]] towards more intervention and control will not profoundly and perversely affect the social and economic life.

{{IPA notice}}
The English words '''Daoism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) and '''Taoism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) are alternative spellings for the same-named [[Chinese philosophy#Daoism|Chinese philosophy]] and [[Religion in China#Taoism|religion]]. The root for [[Daoism]] or [[Taoism]] is the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word [[wikt:道|道]] ("road" or "way"), which was transcribed ''[[wikt:tao#English|tao]]'' or ''tau'' in the earliest systems for the [[romanization of Chinese]] and ''[[wikt:dao#English|dao]]'' or ''dau'' in 20th century systems.

==Phonology==
In order to explain why English ''Taoism'' is correctly pronounced ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}), it is necessary to introduce some technical terminology from [[linguistics]]. A [[phoneme]] is the smallest unit of [[speech sound]]s that a particular language distinguishes, and unrelated languages can have disparate [[Phoneme#Numbers of phonemes in different languages|phonemic inventories]]. For instance, [[Standard English]], depending on dialect, has about 24 consonant phonemes and [[Standard Chinese]] has 19. To illustrate how phonemic gaps can affect borrowed words, English has {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} consonants and Chinese has {{IPA|/l/}} but not {{IPA|/r/}}, thus, Chinese uses /l-/ to transcribe both /l-/ and /r-/ [[List of loanwords in Chinese#English|English loanwords]]; for example, ''léishè'' [[wikt:镭射|镭射]] "[[laser]]" and ''léidá'' [[wikt:雷达|雷达]] "[[radar]]". Conversely, Japanese has the /r-/ phoneme but not /l-/, with borrowings of ''rēza'' [[wikt:レーザ|レーザ]] and ''rēdā'' [[wikt:レーダー|レーダー]].

In [[phonetics]], the consonant of Chinese ''tao'' or ''dào'' 道 is classified as an [[unaspirated consonant|unaspirated]] [[denti-alveolar consonant|denti-alveolar stop]]. [[Aspiration (phonetics)|Aspiration]] is [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] that involves an audible puff of breath; for example, the /t/ in English ''tore'' {{IPA|[tʰɔr]}} is aspirated with a burst of air while the /t/ in ''store'' {{IPA|[stɔr]}} is unaspirated. The IPA symbol for aspiration is a superscript "h", {{IPA|[ʰ]}} (e.g., {{IPA|pʰ}}), and the optional diacritic for unaspiration is a superscript equals sign "=", {{IPA|[⁼]}} (e.g., {{IPA|p⁼}}). A [[stop consonant]] or oral [[occlusive]] is a [[consonant]] in which the speaker blocks the vocal tract so that all [[airstream mechanism|airflow]] ceases, and a [[denti-alveolar consonant]] is articulated with a flat tongue against the [[alveolar ridge]] and upper teeth. 

The present Chinese unaspirated denti-alveolar stop in pinyin ''dào'' 道 is commonly transcribed with the IPA symbol [{{IPA link|t}}], although some linguists prefer using {{IPA|[d̥]}} with the [[slack voice|voiceless]] [[Ring (diacritic)#Underring|under-ring]] diacritic. The sinologist and phonologist [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] explains the reason for using {{IPA|[d̥]}} instead of [t] for Pinyin ''d''. Chinese stops and [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] fall into two contrasting unaspirated and aspirated series. The unaspirated series (''b'', ''d'', ''z'', etc.) is [[lenis]], and "often gives the impression of being voiced to the untrained ear", while the aspirated series (''p'', ''t'', ''c'', etc.) is strongly aspirated (1988:139). [[Standard Chinese phonology]] uses aspiration for the [[Contrastive distribution#Phonology|contrastive distribution]] of consonantal stops. For example, phonemically differentiating the unaspirated denti-alveolar stop /{{IPA link|t}}/ with the aspirated denti-alveolar stop /{{IPA link|tʰ}}/, as in unaspirated ''dào'' or /{{IPA|taʊ}}/ 道 "way" and aspirated ''tào'' or /{{IPA|tʰaʊ}}/ [[wikt:套|套]] "sheath; case; cover". 

Instead of aspiration, [[English phonology]] primarily contrasts stop consonants by [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]], that is, the [[vocal cords]] vibrate in a voiced sound but not in a voiceless or unvoiced one. The voiced stops ({{IPAblink|d}}, {{IPAblink|ɡ}}, and {{IPAblink|b}}) are in complementary distribution with voiceless ({{IPAblink|t}}, {{IPAblink|k}}, and ({{IPAblink|p}}). Voiced stops are usually unaspirated and voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated. There are six voiceless plosives in Chinese: simple and aspirated p p', t t', k k', which would correspond to English voiceless and voiced p b, t d, k g. The six Chinese plosives are generally rendered by English p t k, for instance, simple t in [[moutan]], and [[Tanka people|Tanka]], and aspirated t' in [[Fan-Tan|fantan]] and [[Widow_Twankey#History|twankay]] (Yuan 1981: 251).

In English, aspiration is [[allophone|allophonic]], meaning multiple alternative pronunciations for a single phoneme in a particular language. For example, {{IPA|[pʰ]}} as in ''pin'' and {{IPA|[p]}} as in ''spin'' are allophones for the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} because they cannot distinguish words. English-speakers treat them as the same sound, but they are phonetically different, the first is aspirated and the second is unaspirated.

[[Phonological rule]]s can miss the point when it comes to loanwords, which are borrowings that move from a language with one set of well-formedness conditions to a language with a different set, with the result that adjustments have to be made to meet the new constraints (Yip 1993:262). Coming back to the Chinese unaspirated denti-alveolar stop {{IPA|[t]}} in pinyin ''dào'' 道, this speech sound exists in English—but never as the [[Stress (linguistics)#Lexical stress|stressed]] first syllable in a word. Unaspirated {{IPA|[t]}} occurs instead in words such as "s'''t'''op" or "pa'''t'''" as a complimentary /t/ allophone of the aspirated {{IPA|[tʰ]}} initial ''t'' in English, such as in "'''t'''ap". Owing to the linguistic difference between the Chinese aspirated /tʰ/ vs. unaspirated /t/ phonemic contrast and English voiced /d/ vs. unvoiced /t/ phonemic contrast, an English speaker who is unfamiliar with Chinese romanization will likely pronounce ''Dao'' with the [[voiced alveolar stop]] {{IPAblink|d}} and ''Tao'' with the [[voiceless alveolar stop]] {{IPAblink|t}}. Thus, the Chinese unaspirated {{IPA|/t/}} phoneme in ''dào'' 道 /taʊ/ is nearer to the pronunciation of English voiced unaspirated {{IPA|/d/}} in ''Dow'' /daʊ/ than the voiceless aspirated {{IPA|/t/}} in ''Taos'' [taʊs], but it is neither (Carr 1990: 60).

==Romanizations==
Scholars have been developing [[romanization of Chinese|Chinese romanization]] systems for four centuries, and the unaspirated {{IPA|[taʊ]}} 道 "road; way" has many transcriptions.

[[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries in China]] recorded the earliest romanizations of /taʊ/ 道. The first bilingual [[Chinese dictionary]] in a Western language, [[Michele Ruggieri]]'s and [[Matteo Ricci]]'s [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] 1583-1588 ''Dicionário Português-Chinês'' or ''Pú-Hàn cídiǎn'' 葡漢辭典 (Yong and Peng 2008: 385), transcribed /taʊ/ as "táo" (Witek 2001: 190).{{Citation needed|reason=What Portuguese word does this dictionary translate as 道?|date=August 2018}} The [[Latin language|Latin]] 1615 ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]'', compiled by Matteo Ricci and [[Nicolas Trigault]], romanized it as "tau" in the Chinese term "Tausu" (i.e., ''[[Taoist priest|Daoshi]]'' 道士, "Daoist priest"), which [[Samuel Purchas]]'s 1625 English translation gave as "Tausa" (XII: 461).

During the 19th and 20th centuries, new and revised Chinese romanization schemes flourished. The Standard Chinese pronunciation of 道 is variously transcribed as [[Wade–Giles]] ''tao'' (or ''tao''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; marking [[Standard Chinese phonology#Tonal categories|4th tone]]), [[Legge romanization]] ''tâo'', [[Latinxua Sin Wenz]] ''dau'', [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] ''daw'',  [[Yale romanization of Mandarin|Yale]] ''dàu'', and [[Hanyu Pinyin]] ''dào''. In addition to [[Latin alphabet]] romanizations, there are [[Transliteration of Chinese|transliterations]] of [[Zhuyin fuhao]] ㄉㄠ and Cyrillic [[Cyrillization of Chinese from pinyin|Pallidius System]] ''дао''. Romanization systems use one of two arbitrary ways to represent the Chinese phonemic opposition between aspirated and unaspirated consonants. Take for example, Chinese unaspirated {{IPA|[t̥aʊ]}} [[Wikt:道|道]] "way" and aspirated {{IPA|[tʰaʊ]}} [[Wikt:桃|桃]] "peach". Some systems, like Wade–Giles ''tao'' 道 and ''t'ao'' 桃, introduce a special symbol for aspiration, in this case the [[Greek diacritics|Greek]] [[rough breathing]] diacritic (῾) indicating {{IPA|/h/}} before a vowel; others, like Pinyin ''dao'' 道 and ''tao'' 桃, use "d" and "t". In English and other languages, "d" and "t" indicate a voiced and unvoiced distinction, which is not phonemic in Chinese (Carr 1990: 59).

While many scholars prefer the more familiar spelling "Taoism", arguing that it is now an English word in its own right, the term "Daoism" is becoming increasingly popular.  In one work, "Daoism" was preferred to "Taoism" principally for technical, phonological and conventional reasons, but also because it was thought the modern term "Daoism" helped highlight a departure from earlier Western interpretations of the philosophy (Girardot, Miller, and Liu 2001: xxxi).  Miller later added that "Daoism" is his preferred usage as a distinction "from what 'Taoism' represented in the 20th-century Western imagination" (Miller 2008: xiii).  One commentator, who goes beyond the spelling distinction between [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] "Taoism" and academic "Daoism", discriminates "Taoism" with its common voiced /ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm/ mispronunciation. Having explained that both "Daoism" and "Taoism" are pronounced "with a 'd' sound", i.e., /ˈdaʊ.ɪzəm/, Komjathy describes a [[new religious movement]] labeled "American Taoism" or "Popular Western Taoism" (a term coined by Herman 1998) in which "Taoism" is pronounced with a "hard 't' sound", /ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm/ (2014: 1, 206).

==Borrowings==
Within the [[lexical set]] of [[List of English words of Chinese origin|English words originating from Chinese]], the loanword ''Tao/Dao'' is more typical than the loanblend ''Taoism/Daoism''. Most Sinitic borrowings in English are [[loanwords]] directly [[transliterated]] from Chinese (for example, ''Tao/Dao'' from ''dào'' 道 "way, path; say" or ''[[kowtow]]'' from ''kòutóu'' 叩頭 lit. "knock head"), some are [[calques]] or loan translations (''[[brainwashing]]'' from ''xǐnăo'' 洗腦, lit. "brain wash" or ''[[Red Guards]]'' from ''Hóngwèibīng'' 红卫兵), and a few are [[hybrid word]]s or loanblends that combine a borrowing with a native element (''Taoism/Daoism'' from ''Tao/Dao'' "the Way" and [[-ism]] suffix or ''[[Peking duck]]'' from ''Běijīng kǎoyā'' 北京烤鴨 "roast Beijing duck"). Besides English ''Taoism/Daoism'', other common ''-ism'' borrowings include ''[[Confucianism]]'', ''[[Mohism]]'', and ''[[Maoism]]''. While most Chinese loanwords have a "foreign appearance", monosyllabic ones such as [[Li (Confucianism)|li]] or [[Tong (organization)|tong]] are more likely to remain "alien" than loanblends with English elements such as Taoism or [[tangram]] that are more readily "naturalized" (Yuan 1981: 250).

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd ed.) records the progression of occurrences over the succeeding centuries:  ''Tao'' 1736, ''Tau'' 1747, ''Taouism'' and ''Taouist'' 1838, ''Taoistic'' 1856, ''Tao-ism'' 1858, ''Taoism'' 1903, ''Daoism'' 1948, ''Dao'' and ''Daoist'' 1971.

Linguists distinguish between [[hypercorrection]], the erroneous use of a nonstandard word form due to a belief that it is more accurate than the corresponding standard form (for instance, the /fra:ns/ pronunciation for France /fræns/), and [[hyperforeignism]], the misapplication of foreign loanword pronunciation patterns extended beyond their use in the original language (such as dropping the "t" in [[Bordeaux wine#"Claret" term|claret]] /ˈklærɪt/). ''Taoism'' is neither a hypercorrection because it originated from a spelling misunderstanding rather than a phonemic modification, nor a hyperforeignism because it is not an attempt to sound more Chinese (Carr 1990: 68).

The pronunciation of ''Taoism'' as {{IPA|/ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm/}} instead of {{IPA|/ˈdaʊ.ɪzəm/}} is not unique and typifies many Chinese borrowings in English (e.g., [[gung-ho]], Cohen 1989) that are distorted owing to Chinese romanization systems. Wade-Giles ''[[I Ching]]'' and ''[[T'ai Chi Ch'üan]]'' (Pinyin ''Yìjīng'' and ''Tàijíquán'') are two common cases in which the Pinyin romanization more accurately represents Chinese pronunciation than Wade–Giles (Carr 1990: 67-68). ''I Ching'' transcribes the Chinese /i  t͡ɕiŋ/ [[wikt:易經|易經]] [[Book of Changes]], but some English speakers pronounce it /ˈaɪ tʃiːŋ/, reading Chinese ''I'' /i/ as the English pronoun ''[[I (pronoun)|I]]'' /aɪ/ and the aspirated alveolo-palatal ''Ch'' /  t͡ɕʰ/ as the fortis [[Postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] /tʃ/. The ''T'ai Chi Ch'üan'' martial art /tʰaɪ̯   t͡ɕi   t͡ɕʰy̯ɛn/ [[wikt:太极拳|太极拳]] is commonly misspelled ''Tai Chi Chuan'' (Pinyin ''Daijizhuan'') without umlaut or apostrophes (the Wikipedia article is titled [[Tai chi]]), and is similarly naturalized as English /ˌtaɪ ˌtʃi ˈtʃwɑn/.

==Lexicography==
English dictionaries provide some insights into the ''Daoism''/''Taoism'' pronunciation issue. For over a century, British and American [[lexicography|lexicographers]] glossed the pronunciation of ''Taoism'' as ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}), but gradually began changing it to ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) and added ''Daoism'' entries.

One scholar analyzed ''Taoism'' pronunciation glosses in general-purpose English dictionaries, comparing twelve published in Great Britain (1933–1989) and eleven published in the United States (1948–1987). After standardizing the various dictionary [[Pronunciation respelling for English|respelling systems]] into the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], there are four types of ''Taoism'' glosses involving [[prescriptive linguistics]] and [[descriptive linguistics]]: ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) is prescriptively accurate, ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) describes a common distortion, and the alternate ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) and ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) glosses are more comprehensive (Carr 1990: 63-64).

Nine of the twelve British-English dictionaries gloss the pronunciation of ''Taoism'' as ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}), and three give ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}). The eleven American-English references haves more varied glosses: ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) six times, ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) twice, ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) twice, and ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) once (''[[Oxford American Dictionary|OAD]]'', 1979). The respective first accurate American and British lexicographic glosses for ''Taoism'' were "''douizm; tou''-" (''[[Webster%27s Dictionary#Webster’s New International Dictionary (second edition, 1934)|Webster's Second]]'', 1934) and "Also '''Daoism''' and with pronunc. (dau•iz'm)" (''[[Oxford English Dictionary#Second supplement|OED supplement]]'', 1986). Within the present sample of English-language dictionaries, the American publications were faster to rectify the mistaken ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) pronunciation to ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) (Carr 1990: 64-65).

Besides ({{IPAc-en|t}}) and ({{IPAc-en|d}}) pronunciation variations for the consonant ''T'' in ''Taoism'', the dictionaries also glosses the vocalic ({{IPAc-en|aʊ}}) [[diphthong]] as (/{{IPA|au}}/), (/{{IPA|ɑu}}/), and the [[triphthong]] (/{{IPA|ɑːəu}}/), which may be owing to the old ''Taouism'', ''Tauism'', and ''Tavism'' variant spellings (Carr 1990: 64). For instance, the 1989 ''[[Oxford English Dictionary#Second_edition|OED2]]'' mixed gloss "(ˈtɑːəʊɪz(ə)m, ˈdaʊɪz(ə)m)" combines the (/{{IPA|ɑːəʊ}}/) pronunciation from the 1933 ''[[Oxford English Dictionary#Completion of first edition and first supplement|OED1]]'' ''Taoism'' entry and the ({{IPAc-en|aʊ}}}) from the 1986 ''OED supplement''.

'''Denise A. Spellberg''' (born c. 1958) is an [[United States|American]] scholar of [[Islamic history]]. She is an associate professor of history and [[Middle Eastern studies|Middle Eastern Studies]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. Spellberg holds a BA from [[Smith College]] (1980) and a PhD (1989) from [[Columbia University]].

==Academic work==
Spellberg is the author of ''Politics, Gender, and the Islamic Past: The Legacy of 'A'isha Bint Abi Bakr'', a widely cited work on the portrayal of [[Aisha]] in Islamic tradition.  In particular, Spellberg shows how later commentators reinterpreted Aisha's role at the [[Battle of Camel]] (656,) where she rode her camel into battle against [[Ali]] but stayed inside the [[howdah]] on its back with the curtains closed, as an argument that women should never participate in public affairs.&lt;ref&gt;James E.

Tunstall, ''Displacement, Asylum, Migration: The Oxford Amnesty Lectures'', p. 310 (2006)Oxford University Press{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Jewel of Medina''==
{{Main article|The Jewel of Medina}}
In 2008 Spellberg was involved in a controversy over [[Sherry Jones]]' historical novel ''[[The Jewel of Medina]]''. [[Random House]], which intended to publish the novel later that year, had sent Spellberg [[galley proof]]s, hoping for a publishable comment. Spellberg sharply criticized the novel from a historical perspective, and also reportedly told Random House publishing the book might result in violence by radical Muslims. Subsequently, Random House indefinitely postponed publication, citing concerns about violence from extremists.&lt;ref name="wsj-nomani"&gt;{{cite news|first=Asra Q.|last=Nomani|authorlink=Asra Nomani|title=You Still Can't Write About Mohammad|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121797979078815073|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|date=2008-08-06|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asra Nomani]] wrote about the events in an opinion piece for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', in which she characterized Spellberg as "the instigator of the trouble".&lt;ref name="wsj-nomani"/&gt; In the wake of Nomani's article, a number of publications printed pieces criticizing Spellberg's actions as tantamount to advocating censorship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/21/AR2008082103104.html "Random Error" (editorial)], ''Washington Post'', August 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Triumph of Threats" (editorial), ''Jyllands-Posten'' (translation into English by Gates of Vienna blog), August 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gatesofvienna.net/2008/08/the-triumph-of-threats "The triumph of threats"], gatesofvienna.net, August 2008; accessed December 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hoover, "Censorship Never Goes Out of Style", ''The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', August 31, 2008 [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08244/907791-44.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Islamic Intimidation Trumps Liberty Again, Extremists need not make a single threat to silence writers" (editorial), ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'', August 25, 2008 [http://www.lvrj.com/opinion/27343729.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irshad Manji, "Pre-emptive Censorship is Offensive to Muslims", ''The Globe and Mail'', August 22, 2008 [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080822.wcomanji23/BNStory/specialComment/home]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Kirsch, "Freedom's Gift to Religion", ''New York Sun'', August 26, 2008 [http://www.nysun.com/opinion/freedoms-gift-to-religion/84637]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlin Romano, "'The Jewel of Medina': Anatomy of a Ruckus", ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', September 19, 2008 [http://chronicle.com/weekly/v55/i04/04b00501.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spellberg responded in the ''Wall Street Journal'',  contesting Nomani's characterization of her as the "instigator" of the book's cancellation. She wrote that she was not advocating censorship, but rather offering her professional assessment of the book
and a warning about the potential reaction from some Muslims, stating "I felt it was my professional responsibility to counter this novel's [[Pseudohistory|fallacious representation]] of a very real woman's life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Denise|last=Spellberg|title=I Didn't Kill 'The Jewel of Medina'|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121824366910026293|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|date=2008-08-09|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Amstate1&gt;Edward Nawotka,[http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/08/13/0813spellberg.html "UT professor's complaints lead to cancellation of book about Muhammad's wife"], ''The Austin American-Statesman'', August 13, 2008; accessed December 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Amstate1/&gt;

==''Thomas Jefferson's Qur'an: Islam and the Founders''==
In 2013, Spellberg published ''Thomas Jefferson's Qur'an: Islam and the Founders''. The book discusses a copy of the [[Qur'an]] owned by [[Thomas Jefferson]] as well as Jefferson's views on Islam, arguing that his vision for religious freedom in the United States specifically included Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2013/10/12/230503444/the-surprising-story-of-thomas-jeffersons-quran "The Surprising Story Of 'Thomas Jefferson's Qur'an'"], npr.org, October 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dutch Crossing''''' is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] devoted to all aspects of Low Countries studies: [[Low Countries history|history]] and [[art history]], [[Dutch literature|Dutch]] and [[Flemish literature|Flemish]] (and occasionally [[Afrikaans literature|Afrikaans]]) literary and cultural studies, [[Dutch language]], Dutch as a foreign language, and intercultural and transnational studies. Its stated purpose is to cover "all aspects of 'Global Dutch', not only the [[Netherlands]] and the [[Flanders|Dutch-speaking part of Belgium]] but also other places where Dutch historically had or continues to have an impact, including parts of the Americas, Southern Africa, and South-East Asia."&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tiedau, U.  | year = 2009 | title = A new Dutch Crossing | journal = Dutch Crossing | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–5 | doi = 10.1179/155909009X422455}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special focus concerns exchanges between the Low Countries and the English-speaking world in all periods from the late [[Middle Ages]] to the present day.

==History==
Since 1977 the journal has been edited at the Department of Dutch, first at [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]], Regent’s Park, then since 1983 at [[University College London]]. From modest beginnings as a departmental magazine it developed into one of the main English language journals of interdisciplinary Low Countries studies,&lt;ref name="leadingjournal"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://netherlandicstudies.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/aansnewsletter-71-spring-2010.pdf |title='MLA Dutch Discussion Group' |publisher=Newsletter of the American Association for Netherlandic Studies, no. 71 (Sept. 2010), pp. 8-9 |accessdate=2010-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714165539/http://netherlandicstudies.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/aansnewsletter-71-spring-2010.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="journal2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nederhof | first1 = A.

In the 2009 Journal Awards of the [[Council of Editors of Learned Journals]], ''Dutch Crossing'' received an honourable mention in the [[Phoenix Award for Significant Editorial Achievement]].&lt;ref name="celjawards2009"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.celj.org/phoenix |title=CELJ Awards |publisher=Council of Editors of Learned Journals (CELJ) |accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="celjawards2009-3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1001/10010701 |title=Dutch Crossing: recognition for a journal examining a global influence |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="celjawards2009-2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/sils/newsandevents/silsnewstitle,58529,en.html |title=UCD School of Information &amp; Library Studies on Dutch Crossing |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is published by [[Maney Publishing]] and appears three times per year.

==Name==
The name 'Dutch Crossing' reflects the journal's focus on exchanges between the Low Countries and the Anglophone world,&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bostoen |first=Karel |author-link=Karel Bostoen |author2=David Holmes |author3=Polina Komodikis |author4=Willy Pereboom |author5=Paul Vincent  |title=The Whys and Wherefores |journal=Dutch Crossing |volume=1 |date=March 1977 |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the term, like many similar [[Dutch Courage|English expressions with 'Dutch']] from the 17th century when [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|the two countries were frequently at war]], was originally meant pejoratively.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7985">The '''East Wenatchee Clovis Site''' (also called the '''Richey-Roberts Clovis Site''' or the '''Richey Clovis Cache''') is a deposit of prehistoric [[Clovis points]] and other implements, dating to roughly 11,000 radiocarbon years [[before present]] or about 13,000 calendar years before present, found near the city of [[East Wenatchee]], Washington in 1987. Accidentally discovered in an apple orchard, by Mark Mickels (National Geographic, 1988) it yielded some of the largest stone Clovis points known to science. After controversy over its excavation, the site was sealed off from further digging from 1992 until 2007.

== History ==

The site was accidentally uncovered by Mark Mickels, and also by farmworker Moises Aguirre Calzada on May 27, 1987, while installing an irrigation line. His digging unearthed about two dozen stone bifaces, which were at first mistaken for tools left by contemporary Indian tribes. Orchard co-owner Rich Roberts and his wife Joanne later showed the items to local amateur archaeologist Russell S. Congdon, who identified them as Clovis tools and subsequently contacted archaeologist Robert Mierendorf. The tool kit manufactured by the [[Clovis culture]] is one of the earliest known in the Americas, persisting from about 11,050 to 10,800 radiocarbon years BP.

The site was named by National Park Service archaeologist Robert Mierendorf, the first professional scientist to examine the cache. After the Robertses and their orcharding partner Dr. Mack Richey opened the site to further study, beginning in 1988, it was referred to as the Richey-Roberts Clovis Site and, later, the Richey Clovis Cache.

An excavation in April 1988, led by Peter J. Mehringer of Washington State University, with a team of leading local and national authorities in Paleo-Indian Archaeology and members of  the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, discovered 22 more stone and bone tools, but removed only five for laboratory study. Richey, who in November 1988 bought out his partners and became sole owner of the Clovis site, replaced the Mehringer team with New York archaeologist R. Michael Gramly, who then led another dig in October 1990. This excavation became controversial, with members of the [[Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation]] protesting the state government’s granting of an archaeological permit for Gramly, whose statements and writings questioned a link between Clovis [[Paleo-Indians]] and modern Indians. Gramly had also argued against new laws that, in his view, tied the hands of U.S. archaeologists in favor of protecting Indian cultural heritage. In addition, the Tribes objected to the excavation of the site for personal profit (see below).

In light of the dispute, Gramly’s dig proceeded on a shortened time frame, and ultimately removed approximatively 69 artifacts including tools, debitage, and bone fragments before closing the site. An uncertain number of items, including two more bone artifacts, were left in place. In 1992 Richey donated all the recovered Clovis artifacts and sold the archaeological rights to the 35-square-meter site for $250,000 to the Washington State Historical Society, which owns them in perpetuity. The sale contract stipulated that no archaeological work could take place for 15 years after the purchase; that moratorium expired June 1, 2007, although no new scientific digging has since taken place. Richey sold the entire orchard to a new owner in 2004. At this time what was once an archaeological site was re-filled with dirt, covered with a cement slab, and restored to be part of the orchard.

== Significance ==

The East Wenatchee Clovis Site yielded 36 ancient stone tools and 12 transversely beveled rods of carved and in some cases incised [[mammoth]] or [[mastodon]] bone, plus scores of stone flakes or "debitage" left over from tool manufacture or maintenance. It was the only intact Clovis site ever found in Washington state, and one of many significant prehistoric finds in the state’s history. The cache held the largest Clovis points then known to science, one of them 9.15&amp;nbsp;inches (23.25&amp;nbsp;cm) long, knapped from white [[agate]] (also called chalcedony). Before this discovery the largest Clovis points were only measured at around 6&amp;nbsp;inches. Much of the cache remained "in context" for scientists to explore, meaning it was not overly disturbed by digging prior to archaeological work. Most major Clovis caches have only been explored after they were unearthed and scattered by road projects and construction work, or removed to private collections.

Some researchers postulated that the cache might have represented a large habitation camp; a hunting toolkit, buried and then dug up for seasonal stalking of game; a ceremonial or funeral site; or a ritual offering to stave off ecological harm brought on by the eruption of nearby [[Glacier Peak]], 11,250 radiocarbon years BP, even though the presence of large amounts of debitage and fragmented bone is a good indicator that the site didn't represent a cache at all and the Glacier Peak eruption is thought to have occurred over two centuries before the emergence of the Clovis culture. Some members of Northwest Indian tribes claimed the Clovis hunters as ancestors, and argued against exploring the site out of respect for the dead. The debate helped frame archaeologists’ relationships with local tribes in future research.

The site continues to operate as a commercial apple orchard as of 2007. As researchers Ruth Kirk and Richard D. Daugherty wrote, "Despite all the care taken, certain risks to the site remain. How will orchard chemicals and irrigation water affect bone still in the ground? And what about ongoing bioturbation, the disturbance caused by roots and rodents? The site in the orchard was essentially undisturbed when its window to the past was opened, albeit slightly. It has been sampled but not fully excavated. Enigma remains."&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Ruth and Daugherty, Richard D., Archaeology in Washington, University of Washington Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Encyclopedia of Cybernetics''''' ({{lang-uk|Енциклопедія кібернетики}}) is a [[Ukrainian language]] encyclopedia of [[computer science]] first published in [[Kiev]] in 1973, with [[Victor Glushkov]] serving as its chief editor. The encyclopedia comprises two volumes containing over 1700 articles, primarily on topics in [[theoretical computer science]], [[systems science]], [[information theory]], [[optimization]] and [[control theory]]. The articles were composed by some 600 scientists from various disciplines, affiliated with 102 educational and industrial institutions located throughout the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1974 the encyclopedia was translated into [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref name=istprav&gt;{{url|http://www.istpravda.com.ua/digest/2011/02/7/22204/view_print/}}  online {{ref-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{confuse|Ethnos (disambiguation){{!}}Ethnos}}
[[File:Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly and the statue Ethos.jpg|thumb|A sculpture representing Ethos outside the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly]] in Canberra, Australia]]
'''Ethos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|θ|ɒ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|iː|θ|oʊ|s}}) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning "character" that is used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation, or ideology. The Greeks also used this word to refer to the power of music to influence emotions, behaviours, and even morals.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Piero and Taruskin, Richard, "Music in the Western World: A History in Documents" (1984) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Early Greek stories of [[Orpheus]] exhibit this idea in a compelling way. The word's use in [[rhetoric]] is closely based on the Greek terminology used by [[Aristotle]] in his concept of the three artistic proofs or [[modes of persuasion]].

==Etymology and origin==
''Ethos'' ({{lang|grc|ἦθος}}, {{lang|grc|ἔθος}}; ''plurals:'' ''ethe'', {{lang|grc|ἤθη}}; ''ethea'', {{lang|grc|ἤθεα}}) is a Greek word originally meaning "accustomed place" (as in {{lang|grc|ἤθεα ἵππων}} "the habitats of horses", ''[[Iliad]]'' 6.511, 15.268),&lt;ref&gt;Proscurcin Jr., ''Der Begriff Ethos bei Homer.'' (2014) pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt; "custom, habit", equivalent to Latin ''[[mores]]''.

''Ethos'' forms the root of ''ethikos'' ({{lang|grc|ἠθικός}}), meaning "moral, showing moral character".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Book 2 (1103a17)&lt;/ref&gt; As an adjective in the neuter plural form ''ta ethika'' ({{lang|grc|τὰ ἠθικά}}), used for the study of morals, it is the origin of the modern English word ''[[ethics]]''.

==Current usage==
In modern usage, ethos denotes the disposition, character, or fundamental values particular to a specific person, people, corporation, culture, or movement. For example, the poet and critic [[T. S. Eliot]] wrote in 1940 that "the general ethos of the people they have to govern  determines the behaviour of politicians".&lt;ref&gt;T. S. Eliot, ''The idea of a Christian society'' (1940) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the historian [[Orlando Figes]] wrote in 1996 that in Soviet Russia of the 1920s "the ethos of the  [[Communist]] party dominated every aspect of public life".&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Figes, ''A people's tragedy: the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], 1891–1924'' (1996) p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This statement requires further elaboration to be intelligible: When used in the rhetorical tradition, in addition to what motivates the individual, ethos establishes credibility for the individual among the audience, which is essential in a successful attempt at persuasion.--&gt;
Ethos may change in response to new ideas or forces. For example, according to the Jewish historian Afrie Krampf, ideas of economic modernization which were imported into [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 1930s brought about "the abandonment of the agrarian ethos and the reception of...the ethos of rapid development".&lt;ref&gt;Afrie Krampf, "Reception of the Developmental Approach in the Jewish Economic Discourse of Mandatory Palestine, 1934–1938," ''Israel Studies,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 15#2, pp. 80–103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==
{{POV-section|date=January 2016}}
In [[rhetoric]], ethos is one of the three artistic proofs (''pistis'', πίστις) or [[modes of persuasion]] (other principles being ''[[logos#Aristotle.27s rhetorical logos|logos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]'') discussed by [[Aristotle]] in '[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]' as a component of argument. Speakers must establish ethos from the start.  This can involve "moral competence" only; Aristotle however broadens the concept to include [[expertise]] and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ethos Dwells Pervasively'' In: ''The Ethos of Rhetoric.'' (2004) pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woerther, ''L'èthos aristotélicien.'' (2007) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Ethos is limited, in his view, by what the speaker says. Others however contend that a speaker's ethos extends to and is shaped by the overall moral character and history of the speaker—that is, what people think of his or her character before the speech has even begun (cf [[Isocrates]]).

According to [[Aristotle]], there are three categories of ethos:

* ''[[phronesis]]''&amp;nbsp;– useful skills &amp; wisdom
* ''[[Arete (excellence)|arete]]''&amp;nbsp;– virtue, goodwill
* ''[[eunoia]]''&amp;nbsp;– goodwill towards the audience

In a sense, ethos does not belong to the speaker but to the audience. Thus, it is the audience that determines whether a speaker is a high- or a low-ethos speaker. Violations of ethos include:

* The speaker has a direct interest in the outcome of the debate (e.g. a person pleading innocence of a crime);
* The speaker has a vested interest or ulterior motive in the outcome of the debate;
* The speaker has no expertise (e.g. a lawyer giving a speech on space flight is less convincing than an astronaut giving the same speech).

Completely dismissing an argument based on any of the above violations of ethos is an informal fallacy ([[Appeal to motive]]). The argument may indeed be suspect; but is not, in itself, invalid.

===Modern interpretations===
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

For Aristotle, a speaker's ethos was a rhetorical strategy employed by an orator whose purpose was to "inspire trust in his audience" (''Rhetorica'' 1380). ''Ethos'' was therefore achieved through the orator's "good sense, good moral character, and goodwill", and central to Aristotelian virtue ethics was the notion that this "good moral character" was increased in virtuous degree by habit (''Rhetorica'' 1380). Aristotle links virtue, habituation, and ''ethos'' most succinctly in Book II of ''Nichomachean Ethics'': "Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching [...] while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit, whence also its name ''ethike'' is one that is formed by a slight variation from the word ''ethos'' (habit)" (952). Discussing women and rhetoric, scholar Karlyn Kohrs Campbell notes that entering the public sphere was considered an act of moral transgression for females of the nineteenth century: "Women who formed moral reform and abolitionist societies, and who made speeches, held conventions, and published newspapers, entered the public sphere and thereby lost their claims to purity and piety" (13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Man Cannot Speak for Her: Volume I; A Critical Study of Early Feminist Rhetoric|last = Campbell|first = Karlyn Kohrs|publisher = Praeger|year = 1989|isbn = |location = |pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crafting an ethos within such restrictive moral codes, therefore, meant adhering to membership of what Nancy Fraser and Michael Warner have theorized as counterpublics. While Warner contends that members of counterpublics are afforded little opportunity to join the dominant public and therefore exert true agency, Nancy Fraser has problematized Habermas's conception of the public sphere as a dominant "social totality"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Publics and Counterpublics|last = Warner|first = Michael|date = 2002|journal = Public Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; by theorizing "subaltern counterpublics", which function as alternative publics that represent "parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses, which in turn permit them to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs" (67).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of the Actually Existing Democracy|last = Fraser|first = Nancy|date = 1990|journal = Social Text|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though feminist rhetorical theorists have begun to offer more nuanced ways to conceive of ethos, they remain cognizant of how these classical associations have shaped and still do shape women's use of the rhetorical tool. Johanna Schmertz draws on Aristotelian ethos to reinterpret the term alongside feminist theories of subjectivity, writing that, "Instead of following a tradition that, it seems to me, reads ethos somewhat in the manner of an Aristotelian quality proper to the speaker's identity, a quality capable of being deployed as needed to fit a rhetorical situation, I will ask how ethos may be dislodged from identity and read in such a way as to multiply the positions from which women may speak" (83).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Constructing Essences: Ethos and the Postmodern Subject of Feminism|last = Schmertz|first = Johanna|date = 1999|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetorical scholar and professor Kate Ronald's claim that "ethos is the appeal residing in the tension between the speaker's private and public self", (39)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Reexamination of Personal and Public Discourse in Classical Rhetoric|last = Ronald|first = Kate|date = 1990|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; also presents a more postmodern view of ethos that links [[credibility]] and identity. Similarly, Nedra Reynolds and Susan Jarratt echo this view of ethos as a fluid and dynamic set of identifications, arguing that "these split selves are guises, but they are not distortions or lies in the philosopher's sense. Rather they are 'deceptions' in the sophistic sense: recognitions of the ways one is positioned multiply differently" (56).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ethos: New Essays in Rhetorical and Critical Theory|last = Susan|first = Jarratt|publisher = Southern Methodist University Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Dallas|pages = 37–69|last2 = Reynolds|first2 = Nedra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetorical scholar Michael Halloran has argued that the classical understanding of ethos "emphasizes the conventional rather than the idiosyncratic, the public rather than the private" (60). Commenting further on the classical etymology and understanding of ''ethos'', Halloran illuminates the interdependence between ''ethos'' and cultural context by arguing that "To have ethos is to manifest the virtues most valued by the culture to and for which one speaks" (60).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Aristotle's Concept of Ethos, or if not His, Someone Else's|last = Halloran|first = Michael|date = 1982|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While scholars do not all agree on the dominant sphere in which ethos may be crafted, some agree that ethos is formed through the negotiation between private experience and the public, rhetorical act of self-expression. Karen Burke LeFevre's argument in ''Invention as Social Act'' situates this negotiation between the private and the public, writing that ethos "appears in that socially created space, in the 'between', the point of intersection between speaker or writer and listener or reader" (45-46).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invention as a Social Act|last = LeFevre|first = K. B.|publisher = Southern Illinois University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nedra Reynolds, "ethos, like postmodern subjectivity, shifts and changes over time, across texts, and around competing spaces" (336). However, Reynolds additionally discusses how one might clarify the meaning of ethos within rhetoric as expressing inherently communal roots. This stands in direct opposition to what she describes as the claim "that ethos can be faked or 'manipulated'" because individuals would be formed by the values of their culture and not the other way around (336). Rhetorical scholar John Oddo also suggests that ethos is negotiated across a community, and not simply a manifestation of the self (47). In the era of mass-mediated communication, Oddo contends, one's ethos is often created by journalists and dispersed over multiple news texts. With this in mind, Oddo coins the term intertextual ethos, the notion that a public figure's "ethos is constituted within and across a range of mass media voices" (48).

In "Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos", scholar Coretta Pittman notes that race has been generally absent from theories of ethos construction, and that this concept is troubling for black women. Pittman writes, "Unfortunately, in the history of race relations in America, black Americans' ethos ranks low among other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. More often than not, their moral characters have been associated with a criminalized and sexualized ethos in visual and print culture" (43).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos: Harriet Jacobs, Billie Holiday, and Sister Souljah|last = Pittman|first = Corretta|date = 2007|journal = Rhetoric Society Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character in Greek tragedy==
The ways in which characters were constructed is important when considering ethos, or character, in [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, ''Aristotle's Poetics.'' (1998) pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus Taber Murray explains that the depiction of a character was limited by the circumstances under which Greek tragedies were presented. These include the single unchanging scene, necessary use of the chorus, small number of characters limiting interaction, large outdoor theatres, and the use of masks, which all influenced characters to be more formal and simple.&lt;ref name=M534&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray also declares that the inherent characteristics of Greek tragedies are important in the makeup of the characters. One of these is the fact that tragedy characters were nearly always mythical characters. This limited the character, as well as the plot, to the already well-known myth from which the material of the play was taken. The other characteristic is the relatively short length of most Greek plays.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Ancient Theater and Performance Culture'' In: ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Theater.'' (2007) pp. 36 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This limited the scope of the play and characterization, so that the characters were defined by one overriding motivation toward a certain objective from the beginning of the play.&lt;ref name=M546&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Murray clarifies that strict constancy is not always the rule in Greek tragedy characters. To support this, he points out the example of Antigone who, even though she strongly defies Creon in the beginning of the play, begins to doubt her cause and plead for mercy as she is led to her execution.&lt;ref name=M59&gt;Murray (1916), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other aspects of the character element in ancient Greek tragedy are worth noting.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, ''Aristoteles über das Wesen und die Wirkung der Tragödie (Kap. 6)'' In: ''Aristoteles. Poetik.'' (2009) pp. 87 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these, which C. Garton discusses, is the fact that either because of contradictory action or incomplete description, the character cannot be viewed as an individual, or the reader is left confused about the character.&lt;ref name=G247&gt;Garton (1957), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; One method of reconciling this would be to consider these characters to be flat, or type-caste, instead of round. This would mean that most of the information about the character centers around one main quality or viewpoint.&lt;ref name=G2478&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable to the flat character option, the reader could also view the character as a symbol. Examples of this might be the Eumenides as vengeance, or Clytemnestra as symbolizing ancestral curse.&lt;ref name=G248&gt;Garton (1957), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another means of looking at character, according to Tycho von Wilamowitz and Howald, is the idea that characterisation is not important. This idea is maintained by the theory that the play is meant to affect the viewer or reader scene by scene, with attention being only focused on the section at hand. This point of view also holds that the different figures in a play are only characterised by the situation surrounding them, and only enough so that their actions can be understood.&lt;ref name=G2489&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garet makes three more observations about character in Greek tragedy. The first is an abundant variety of types of characters in Greek tragedy. His second observation is that the reader or viewer's need for characters to display a unified identity that is similar to human nature is usually fulfilled. Thirdly, characters in tragedies include incongruities and idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref name=G250&gt;Garton (1957), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect stated by Garet is that tragedy plays are composed of language, character, and action, and the interactions of these three components; these are fused together throughout the play. He explains that action normally determines the major means of characterisation. Another principle he states is the importance of these three components' effect on each other; the important repercussion of this being character's impact on action.&lt;ref name=G2501&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 250–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustus Taber Murray also examines the importance and degree of interaction between plot and character. He does this by discussing Aristotle's statements about plot and character in his Poetics: that plot can exist without character, but character cannot exist without plot, and so character is secondary to plot. Murray maintains that Aristotle did not mean that complicated plot should hold the highest place in a tragedy play. This is because the plot was, more often than not, simple and therefore not a major point of tragic interest. Murray conjectures that people today do not accept Aristotle's statement about character and plot because to modern people, the most memorable things about tragedy plays are often the characters.&lt;ref name=M52&gt;Murray (1916), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Murray does concede that Aristotle is correct in that "[t]here can be no portrayal of character [...] without at least a skeleton outline of plot".&lt;ref name=M53&gt;Murray (1916), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character, or ethos, in pictorial narrative==
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

Ethos, or character, also appears in the visual art of famous or mythological ancient Greek events in murals, on pottery, and sculpture, referred to generally as pictorial narrative. Aristotle even praised the ancient Greek painter Polygnotos because his paintings included characterization. The way in which the subject and his actions are portrayed in visual art can convey the subject's ethical character and through this the work's overall theme, just as effectively as poetry or drama can.&lt;ref name=C11&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This characterisation portrayed men as they ought to be, which is the same as Aristotle's idea of what ethos or character should be in tragedy. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 178) Professor Mark D. Stansbury-O'Donnell states that pictorial narratives often had ethos as its focus, and was therefore concerned with showing the character's moral choices. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 175) David Castriota, agreeing with Stansbury-O'Donnell's statement, says that the main way Aristotle considered poetry and visual arts to be on equal levels was in character representation and its effect on action.&lt;ref name=C10&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Castriota also maintains about Aristotle's opinion that "his interest has to do with the influence that such ethical representation may exert upon the public". Castriota also explains that according to Aristotle, "[t]he activity of these artists is to be judged worthy and useful above all because exposure of their work is beneficial to the [[polis]]".&lt;ref name=C10 /&gt; Accordingly, this was the reason for the representation of character, or ethos, in public paintings and sculptures. In order to portray the character's choice, the pictorial narrative often shows an earlier scene than when the action was committed. Stansbury-O'Donnell gives an example of this in the form of a picture by the ancient Greek artist Exekia which shows the Greek hero Ajax planting his sword in the ground in preparation to commit suicide, instead of the actual suicide scene. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 177.) Additionally, Castriota explains that ancient Greek art expresses the idea that character was the major factor influencing the outcome of the Greeks' conflicts against their enemies. Because of this, "ethos was the essential variable in the equation or analogy between myth and actuality".&lt;ref name=C12&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[folklore]] a '''fairy path''' (or 'passage', 'avenue', or 'pass') is a route taken by fairies usually in a straight line and between sites of traditional significance, such as [[fairy fort]]s or [[Ringfort|raths]] (a class of circular earthwork dating from the [[Iron Age]]), "airy" (eerie) mountains and hills, thorn bushes, springs, lakes, rock outcrops, and Stone Age monuments. [[Ley line]]s and spirit paths, such as with [[corpse road]]s, have some similarities with these fairy paths.  A [[fairy ring]] is also a path used by fairies, but in a circle, for dancing, as described by poet [[W. B. Yeats]], "...the fairies dance in a place apart, Shaking their milk-white feet in a ring,..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Earth, Air, Fire, Water|last=Skelton| first=Robin|others= Margaret Blackwood| page= 181|publisher=Arkana, Penguin Group| year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is usually associated with [[Gaelic folklore (disambiguation)|Celtic folklore]], especially that of Ireland.

==Fairy paths and dwellings==
In some parts of Ireland, Brittany and Germany&lt;ref&gt;''Ley Lines: the Greatest Landscape Mystery'' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005
{{ISBN|0-9542963-4-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9542963-4-6}}; p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; there were fairy or spirit paths that while being invisible nevertheless had such perceived geographical reality in the minds of the country people that building practices were adapted to ensure they were not obstructed. A significant number of the characteristics of fairy paths are shared in common with [[ley line]]s. In many parts of Northern Europe the [[tumulus|round barrow]]s were the traditional homes of the [[fairies]], [[elves]], or [[trolls]] and were avoided by the country folk. Such places were Fairy Toot in [[Somerset]], Elf Howe barrow near [[Folkton]], Yorkshire, and a round barrow at [[Beedon]] in Berkshire. [[Cornwall]] was and is a stronghold of fairy lore: fairies are said to dance on [[Ballowall Barrow|Carn Gluze]], near [[St Just in Penwith]].&lt;ref name ="Bord72"&gt;Bord, Janet &amp; Colin (1973) ''Mysterious Britain''. Garnstone Press. {{ISBN|0-85511-180-1}}; p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In Danish [[Jutland]] there was a belief that "Barrow-folk" dwelt in barrows and were descendants of [[fallen angel]]s cast out of [[Heaven]].&lt;ref name=northmyth&gt;''Northern Mythology, Comprising the Principal Popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and the Netherlands'', Benjamin Thorpe &amp; E. Lumley, 1851; pp. 115–124&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, it was considered bad luck to let cattle graze on any place where the Elf-folk have been, or to let the cattle mingle with the large blue cattle of the elves. However, all evils may be averted if one were to ask at an "Elf-barrow" for permission to graze cattle on their mound.&lt;ref name=northmyth/&gt; Some Danish "Elf-barrows" included one near Galtebjerg, another not far from [[Kalundborg]]; one between [[Thisted]] and [[Aalborg]] that was said to be the home of an elfin [[Smithing|smith]]; two near [[Sundby, Copenhagen|Sundby]] where a troll-smith would ride from one to the other followed by his apprentices and journeymen; and one at Tröstrup where according to legend a giant was buried, and it was said his daughter wandered across the fields and one day met a ploughman whom she took back to her father who then set the man free, fearing that they'd be driven out of their barrow.&lt;ref name=northmyth/&gt; In [[Sweden]] similar beliefs existed and one barrow called ''Helvetesbacke'' (''"Hell's mouth"'') that lies near Kråktorps gård, [[Småland]], was claimed to be the burial mound of [[Odin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Northern Mythology, Comprising the Principal Popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and the Netherlands'', Benjamin Thorpe &amp; E. Lumley, 1851; p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany the [[Wild Hunt|Wild Troop of Rodenstein]] was said to ride a straight path between the castles of Rodenstein and Schnellert. Also throughout Europe are [[Corpse roads]], which are generally believed to be of the same basic belief as ''fairy paths'' and most likely share an origin.&lt;ref&gt;'Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005
{{ISBN|0-9542963-4-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9542963-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany and the [[Netherlands]] in particular, these tend to be straight invisible lines and are known by a variety of names including ''Geisterweg'' ("ghost-way" or "ghost-road") and ''Helweg'' ("hell-way" or "hell-road") in German&lt;ref&gt;'Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005
{{ISBN|0-9542963-4-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9542963-4-6}}, pages. 101–103&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Doodweg'' ("death-way" or "death-road") in [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref&gt;'Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005
{{ISBN|0-9542963-4-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9542963-4-6}}, page. 189&lt;/ref&gt; A similarly straight road did however run straight over various burial mounds at Rösaring, [[Lassa, Sweden|Lassa]] in southern Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;'Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery' by Danny Sullivan, Green Magic, 2005

==Consequences of blocking fairy paths==
[[File:Fairy Ring 0004.JPG|thumb|right|180px|&lt;center&gt;A [[Fairy Ring]] of mushrooms&lt;center&gt;]]
In Ireland, people who had illnesses or other misfortune, were said to live in houses that were "in the way" or in a "contrary place", obstructing a fairy path. An example is that of a family in which four children sickened and died, leaving the doctors baffled. The fifth child sickened and was near death, only to make a sudden and full recovery. The father told the doctor that he had consulted a wise woman who informed him that his new house extension blocked a fairy path between two fairy forts, whereupon he demolished it and his child became healthy again.&lt;ref name="Bord27"&gt;Bord, Janet and Colin (1976). ''The Secret Country''. Pub. [[Paul Elek]], London. {{ISBN|0-236-40048-7}}. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ängsälvor - Nils Blommér 1850.jpg|thumb|left|Fairies of the meadow, by [[Nils Blommér]]]]
An example of this fairy path straightness is provided by an account concerning a croft (now a cattle shed) at Knockeencreen, [[Brosna, County Kerry]]. In an interview in the 1980s, the last human occupant told of the troubles his grandfather had experienced there, with his cattle periodically and inexplicably dying. The front door is exactly opposite the back door. The grandfather was informed by a passing Gypsy that the dwelling stands on a fairy path running between two hills. The Gypsy advised the grandfather to keep the doors slightly ajar at night to allow the fairies free passage. The advice was heeded and the problem ceased. It so happens that the building is indeed on a straight line drawn between two local hilltops, and is, moreover, at one end of a long, straight track.&lt;ref name="Fortean"&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/491/where_the_leylines_led.html Where the Leylines led] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913113534/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/491/where_the_leylines_led.html |date=13 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wentz38"&gt;Wentz, W. Y. (1911). ''The Fairy-faith in Celtic Countries.'' Reprinted. Colin Smythe (1981). {{ISBN|0-901072-51-6}}. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fairies processed from Rath Ringlestown in Ireland every night and parents brought their children in before the fairies were due to pass. The path passed round several bushes which were left undisturbed by the locals. A man who cut down one bush could not get it to burn and sickened and died within a short while as a supposed consequence of his actions. The route also passed between two mud-wall houses and a man who was out at the wrong time was found dead; the fairies having taken him for getting in the way of the procession.&lt;ref name="Wentz38"/&gt;
A traditional folk tale from the Southern Shore of Newfoundland, Canada, concerns a young married couple who discovered that they had built their house on a path used by the good people, and the steps that couple take to rid themselves of fairy mischief. It seems therefore that the fairy folk had emigrated together with their human counterparts or had been in Canada from time immemorial.&lt;ref name="Newfoundland"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/DaleJarvisTheHouseOnTheFairyPath.  Newfoundland Fairy Path.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Home-owners have knocked corners from houses because the corner blocked the fairy path,&lt;ref name="Silver-hiding"&gt;Silver, Carole G. (1999) Strange and Secret Peoples: Fairies and Victorian Consciousness. Oxford University Press. p.47 {{ISBN|0-19-512199-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cottages have been built with the front and back doors in line, so that the owners could, in need, leave them both open and let the fairies troop through all night.&lt;ref&gt;Lenihan, Eddie and Green, Carolyn Eve (2004) ''Meeting The Other Crowd:  The Fairy Stories of Hidden Ireland''. pp.146–7 {{ISBN|1-58542-206-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was believed that a house built on a fairy path would suffer from midnight noises or supernatural manifestations. Ill-luck in the form of sick farm animals or personal illness could be the result and one remedy was to build small fires in several places along the fairy path, using fire from the blessed fire of [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist|Saint John]]'s Eve that was lit every year at sunset on 23 June.&lt;ref name="Bord"&gt;Bord, Janet and Colin (1976). ''The Secret Country''. Pub. Paul Elek, London. {{ISBN|0-236-40048-7}}. pp. 26 – 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detecting fairy paths and overcoming their influence==
[[File:Fairychapeltoun.JPG|Thumb|right|150px]]
Some builders used to use a technique to see if the planned construction was going to be on a fairy path; they would map out the floor plan in the earth and place a pile of stones at each corner and leave it overnight, if the stones were undisturbed it was safe to build, otherwise the work would not continue. There is another theme that states if one's house is on a fairy path, one must leave the doors and windows open at night, front and back, to allow fairies to pass through. Builders were also advised against using white quartz in their stonework, as it is said to be a fairy stone.&lt;ref name="Maljonic"&gt;[http://www.maljonicsdreams.com/Dream_Spells/fairy_paths.htm Maljonic's Fairy Paths]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wise-women were thought to be able to advise home builders of the existence of fairy paths, however in most folk-tales they are only consulted after the event and as a result of disturbances, bad luck, etc.

A building placed on a fairy path would be demolished by the fairy folk, at least twice, often remaining standing however on the third attempt.&lt;ref name="Wentz67"&gt;Wentz, W. Y. (1911). ''The Fairy-faith in Celtic Countries.'' Reprinted. Colin Smythe (1981). {{ISBN|0-901072-51-6}}. P. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walking along fairy paths==
Paths that the fairies travel along are usually stated as being best avoided, however they also had certain benefits to humans, such as with [[Trod|'trods']] in the West of England. These are a straight-line fairy path in the grass of a field with a different shade of green to the rest. People with rheumatism sought relief by walking along these tracks, though animals avoid them. Great danger was still very much associated with using these paths at times when a supernatural procession might be using them. [[Fairy ring]]s have certain elements in common with this phenomenon and were seen as 'gateways' into the realm of supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="Pennick1996132"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1996). ''Celtic Sacred Landscapes''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-01666-6}}. P. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tylwyth teg]] of Wales have paths on which it is death for a mortal to walk.&lt;ref name="Wentz150"&gt;Wentz, W. Y. (1911). ''The Fairy-faith in Celtic Countries.'' Reprinted. Colin Smythe (1981). {{ISBN|0-901072-51-6}}. P. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Breton people|Breton]] [[Ankou]], who is king of the dead, and his subjects have their own particular paths along which they process.&lt;ref name="Wentz218"&gt;Wentz, W. Y. (1911). ''The Fairy-faith in Celtic Countries.'' Reprinted. Colin Smythe (1981). {{ISBN|0-901072-51-6}}. P. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underwater fairy paths ==
Irish fairy paths are said to also exist under water, reminiscent of causeways in marshes at sacred sites and those to [[crannog]]s and other islands. These paths, only used by the fairy folk, ran from one island to another and were paved with coral, making them and their travellers visible to fishermen in their boats above.&lt;ref name="Pennick199613"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1996). ''Celtic Sacred Landscapes''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-01666-6}}. P. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theatre]], a '''farce''' is a comedy that aims at entertaining the audience through situations that are highly exaggerated, extravagant, and thus improbable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordsmyth.net/?ent=farce|title=farce - Free On-Line English Dictionary - Thesaurus - Children's, Intermediate Dictionary - Wordsmyth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farce is also characterized by [[physical comedy|physical humor]], the use of deliberate [[absurdity]] or nonsense, and broadly stylized performances. It is also often set in one particular location, where all events occur. Farces have been written for the stage and film.

:''This article is about gender roles in relationships between Islamic men and women, and their families. For related topics including Islamic women's clothing and juridical differences between the genders, see [[Women in Islam]].''

The [[Quran]], the holiest book in [[Islam]], indicates that men and women are spiritual equals. The Quran 4:124 states:

''"If any do deeds of righteousness be they male or female and have faith, they will enter Heaven, and not the least injustice will be done to them."''
 
But this notion of equality has not been reflected in many of the laws in Muslim-based institutions.&lt;ref name=Safra&gt;Safra project, "sexuality, gender and islam." Last modified 2013. Accessed January 30, 2014. http://www.safraproject.org/sgi-genderroles.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Quran]] does not specify specific [[gender roles]] for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does Islam SPECIFICALLY say women are to be cookers, cleaners and housewives?|url=http://askamufti.com/Answers/ViewQuestion.aspx?QuestionId=1632&amp;CategoryId=35&amp;CategoryName=Women|last=ul Haq|first=Ikram|archive-url=https://archive.fo/20120707145901/http://askamufti.com/Answers/ViewQuestion.aspx?QuestionId=1632&amp;CategoryId=35&amp;CategoryName=Women|access-date=March 14, 2014|archive-date=July 7, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it a woman's duty to cook for her husband?|url=http://askamufti.com/Answers/ViewQuestion.aspx?QuestionId=1631&amp;CategoryId=35&amp;CategoryName=Women|last=ul Haq|first=Ikram|archive-url=https://archive.fo/20120701130728/http://askamufti.com/Answers/ViewQuestion.aspx?QuestionId=1631&amp;CategoryId=35&amp;CategoryName=Women|access-date=March 14, 2014|archive-date=July 1, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salih, Su`ad . Onislam, "Women Working as TV Announcers." Last modified June 18, 2002. Accessed March 14, 2014. http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/financial-issues/earning-livelihood/175434.html.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Islamic practice, gender roles manifest themselves, partially because men and women are sometimes allotted different rights and different cultural expectations.

==Traditional gender roles==
Cultural traditions of nonreligious origin impact gender roles, prevailing cultural norms, and the interpretation of the [[Quran]] and other Islamic texts.&lt;ref name=Sidani&gt;Sidani, Yusuf. "Women, work, and Islam in Arab societies." Women in Management Review. no. 7 (2005): 498-512. http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=0964-9425&amp;volume=20&amp;issue=7&amp;articleid=1524037&amp;show=html (accessed January 30, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Some Reformist and feminist scholars have argued that the concept of guardianship has formed the basis of particular gender roles in Muslim societies. Women are often expected to be obedient wives and mothers staying within the family environment and men are expected to be protectors and caretakers of the family.&lt;ref name=Safra/&gt; However, the majority of Muslim scholars agree that women are not obligated to serve their husbands or do housework or do any kind of work at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It is not compulsory upon the wife to do the housework|url=https://www.islamweb.net/en/article/139500/|quote="The Majority of Muslim scholars are of the opinion that serving one's husband is not compulsory...Imaams Maalik, Ash-Shaaf`i and Abu Haneefah may Allah have mercy upon them support this. Al-Qayyim may Allah have mercy upon him cited that marriage contract enables a husband to enjoy his wife; it does not enable him to engage her in housework."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sistani.org/english/book/46/2065/|title=Women's Issues|quote="...cooking, sewing, cleaning, laundry, etc. These things are not an obligation on her [the wife]"|access-date=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sayyid Qutb]], a prominent member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in the 1950s and 60s, the Quran "gives the man the right of 'guardianship' or 'superiority' over the family structure in order to prevent dissension and friction between the spouses. The equity of this system lies in the fact that God both favoured the man with the necessary qualities and skills for the 'guardianship' and also charged him with the duty to provide for the structure's upkeep." Qutb's ideologies are still impactful today, influencing such prominent Middle Eastern leaders as [[Ayman Zawahiri]] and [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref&gt;Haddad/Esposito pg. 37/38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dress===
Several passages of the [[Quran]] deal with acceptable dress for both men and women. Sura 24, Verses 30-31 states:

[[File:Women wearing burka in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|Women wearing burqas in Afghanistan]]

"''And tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. That is purer for them. Lo! Allah is aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest, and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent, and to draw their veils over their bosoms, and not to reveal their adornment save to [those relatives who fall within bounds of close relationship explained in the Qur’an]...''" Chapter 24, Verses 30-31.

However, there are many different interpretations of what “modesty” requires. The [[Quran]] requires Muslim women to dress modestly and to, at the very least, cover their breasts and genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Martin et al. (2003), Encyclopedia of Islam &amp; the Muslim World, Macmillan Reference.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of [[Hijab]], on the other hand, states that the whole female body (not including the face and hands) should be covered, when a woman leaves her home.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Arabiyah Al-Islamiyah, Darul-Uloom. Inter-Islam, "Hijaab (Veil)." Last modified 2001. Accessed March 14, 2014. http://www.inter-islam.org/Actions/Hijbdu.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote="It is necessary for women to cover their whole bodies from strangers except for the face and hands. No special kind and color of dress is recommended; anything with which the body can be covered would be sufficient."|url=http://www.jannaati.com/eng/index.php?page=6|title=Selected Rulings|access-date=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prayer and worship===
{{Further|Sex segregation and Islam}}
For Friday prayers, by custom, Muslim congregations segregate men, women, and children in separate groups. On other days the women and children pray at home.Men are expected to offer the five daily prayers at the nearest mosque. Muhammad specifically allowed Muslim women to attend mosques and pray behind men.&lt;ref name=prayinginmosques&gt;Onislam, "About Rules of Praying in Mosques." Last modified August 19, 2013. Accessed March 30, 2014. http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-about-islam/faith-and-worship/aspects-of-worship/166196-about-rules-of-praying-in-mosques.html.
&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammad said 'Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque, even though their houses are better for them." which implies it is better for women to stay at home. "A woman’s prayer in her house is better than her prayer in her courtyard, and her prayer in her bedroom is better than her prayer in her house." (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Baab maa jaa’a fee khurooj al-nisaa’ ilaa’l-masjid. See also Saheeh al-Jaami‘, no. 3833).{{better source|reason=Not cited properly|date=September 2017}}

Women are prohibited from praying at a Mosque in Surinam.&lt;ref&gt;Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Baab maa jaa’a fee khurooj al-nisaa’ ilaa’l-masjid: Baab al-tashdeed fee dhaalik. See also Saheeh al-Jaami‘, no. 7458&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexuality==
{{main|Islamic sexual jurisprudence}}

Sexuality as discussed in Islamic texts is generally confined to the context of heterosexual marriage, and in all cases modesty and chastity are strongly encouraged. Pre-marital sex and homosexuality are forbidden, and abortion is largely discouraged except in cases where there are medical risks for the mother. Sexuality in Islam is often separated in terms of male versus female sexuality, marital versus pre-marital versus extramarital sexuality, and heterosexuality versus homosexuality as is pointed out by Abdessamad Dialmy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sexuality and Islam|last = Dialmy|first = Abdessamad|date = June 2010|journal = The European Journal of Contraception and Reproductive Health Care|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Male and female sexuality ===
The Islamic tradition recognizes the sexual desires of both men and women. In many classical arguments, it is the husband's duty to fulfill his wife's sexual needs, which are part of her rights as a married woman. This argument is often paired with the statement that this is how society prevents social unrest (fitna). According to Kecia Ali, "Classical texts note the importance of female fulfillment, while stressing the wives' duty to remain sexually available to their husbands...whereas contemporary authors, focus on women's sexual rights within their marriages, attempting to prove the importance of female pleasure by highlighting the separation of sex from reproduction and the importance of the female orgasm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sexual Ethics &amp; Islam|last = Ali|first = Kecia|publisher = Oneworld Publications|year = 2006|isbn = 9781851684564|location = London, England|pages = 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical authors also stress the importance of male guardianship as the required to protect the chastity and modesty of women in their care.

=== Heterosexuality and homosexuality ===

==== Heterosexuality ====
Traditional Islam considers the heterosexual relationship between a man and a woman the only acceptable relationship. Within this traditional relationship, the male is allowed more room for expression of his sexual rights than the female is as mentioned above. There are three types of heterosexual relationships: pre-marital, marital, and extramarital.

===== Marital, pre-marital and extramarital sex =====

Pre-Marital Sex: Pre-marital sex is frowned upon in general; however, there are strict regulations on men and women to keep their virginity. Men and women are advised to abstain from indulging in indiscriminate sexual relationship for mere satisfaction of carnal desires. Marriage is the only acceptable means to indulge in sexual relationships, any other is considered as "Zina", one of the major sins in Islam. In Islamic marital practices, the male pays a dower for his wife, which is one of the essentials of a valid marriage. Other essentials are the presence of witnesses and 'Waliy' guardian. Muhammad was reported to have said: marriage is not valid without Sadaq, Waliy and Shahidain (Dower, Guardian and Witnesses respectively) The dower is a fixed amount of money or a gift of jewellery or property equivalent to it to the bride as her own. A Muslim marriage is a marriage is there usually solemnized in the mosque before an imam where guardians of both parties appear on their behalf(usually that of the female)and the marriage pronounced after payment of the Sadaq. It is not a contract that needs to be signed by the either of the parties.

Marital Sex: Sex is supposed to be shared between spouses (a man and a woman). Men are technically allowed to take more than one wife, up to four wives as long as he can provide for each wife equally and not differentiate between them in a practice known as polygamy. Polygamy, though technically legal, is not a recommended practice in Islamic culture. Many sectors of the Islamic culture use the life of Muhammad as an example to live by and therefore a justification to polygamous marriages. It is only allowed for men to have multiple wives. Women cannot have multiple husbands.

Extramarital Sex: Sexual affairs outside of marriage are prohibited in Islam, and result in severe punishment for the perpetrating husband or wife, upon rigid proof that they participated in an affair. The proof is given by four male witnesses or eight female witnesses (with clean background histories i.e. known to be pious Muslims), who testify to seeing the act of penetration between the extra-marital couple. Punishment for not being able to provide the required number of witnesses after accusing the defendants is eighty lashes of a whip. 

The couple are given chances to plead for forgiveness to God before the punishment is carried out. If they do not, they will be punished. If both parties are married, they will both be stoned to death. If one is married, while the other is not, the former will be stoned until dead, and the latter will be given a hundred lashes. The severe punishment of an extra-marital are mainly to act as a deterrent to society from engaging in such relationships, as sex outside marriage is a major sin in Islam. The pain of the punishment is also believed to lessen punishment in the afterlife.

However, it is important to note that these punishments can only take place under a Muslim government implementing Sharia Law, and cannot be handed out in a non-Muslim country with a different legal system.

==== Homosexuality ====
{{main|LGBT in Islam}}

Traditional Islamic schools of thought as based on the Quran and hadith usually consider homosexuality to be a punishable sin.&lt;ref&gt;Homosexuality and Lesbianism: Sexual Perversions[dead link] Fatwa on Homosexuality from IslamOnline.net&lt;/ref&gt; In much of the Islamic world, homosexuality is not legal, and in Afghanistan, Iran, Mauritania, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen homosexual acts are punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;ILGA: Lesbian and Gay Rights in the World (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abu Dawud 32:4087&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari 7:72:774&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Majah Vol. 3, Book 9, Hadith 1903&lt;/ref&gt; Most Muslim countries continue to oppose LGBT rights movements, with the exceptions of Albania, Sierra Leone, and Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/es/documents/ior40/024/2008/es/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Over 80 Nations Support Statement at Human Rights Council on LGBT Rights » US Mission Geneva".

Additionally, guardianship, gender roles, and male control over women’s sexuality are also tools that allow for the enforcement of heterosexual norms.&lt;ref name="Safra" /&gt;

===Female genital mutilation===
{{main|Religious views on female genital mutilation}}
[[Female genital mutilation]] is practiced in many Muslim countries, especially within the [[Middle East]], Sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Muslim Women's League, "Female Genital Mutilation." Last modified 1991. Accessed March 30, 2014. http://www.mwlusa.org/topics/violence&amp;harrassment/fgm.html.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Opinions vary widely within and without the Muslim community as to whether female genital mutilation is condoned, condemned, or ignored by Islamic texts. Some quote a passage from Sunan Abu Dawood to tie the practice of female genital mutilation to Islam:&lt;ref name=islamicperspective&gt;Ahmad, Imad-ad-Dean. Minaret of Freedom Institute, "Female Genital Mutilation: An Islamic Perspective." Last modified 200. Accessed March 30, 2014. http://www.minaret.org/fgm-pamphlet.htm.
&lt;/ref&gt;

''“A woman used to perform circumcision in Medina [Madîna]. The Prophet said to her: 'Do not cut severely as that is better for a woman and more desirable for a husband.'”–Sunan Abu Dawûd, Book 41, #5251.''

This passage has been used to justify female genital mutilation, as here Muhammad does not specifically prohibit the practice.&lt;ref name=islamicperspective/&gt; However, the Quran does not mention or prescribe female genital mutilation, and the acceptance and perception of female genital mutilation varies deeply among Islamic region, sect, location, and individuals.

==Masculinities==
At least some of what is deemed to be masculine in Muslim cultures stems from the life and actions of Muhammad as put down in the Hadith.&lt;ref name=Darwish&gt;Darwish, Anwar. "Identity: Masculinity in the Muslim world by Anwar Darwish." altmuslimah.com. http://www.altmuslimah.com/b/mma/3312 (accessed April 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad was married to his first wife Khadija monogamously for 25 years. Upon her death he later married a total of fourteen women and had at least four concubines.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Tabari, Vol. 9, pp. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt; In Sahih al-Bukhari 7:62:142, it is said that Muhammad sometimes had sexual relations with all his wives in one night,&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari 7:62:142&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1:5:268 he is described as having “the strength of thirty men.”&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari 1:5:268&lt;/ref&gt; This, along with a Muslim practice of measuring a man by the number of his male offspring, suggests that virility is a large traditional component of what has long been deemed "masculine" in the Muslim tradition.&lt;ref name=Darwish/&gt; The idea of traditional masculinity is also strongly shaped by the tradition idea of femininity.&lt;ref name=Darwish/&gt; Several classic Muslim authors such as Sheikh Muhammad Nefzawi and Ahmed Bin Selman describe women as beings with insatiable sexual appetites.&lt;ref name=Darwish/&gt; It follows that a man who can satisfy multiple women is seen as incredibly powerful and masculine.&lt;ref name=Darwish/&gt;

In addition to the relationship between Muslim masculinity and female sexuality, some concepts of Muslim masculinity stem from the relationships between Muslim men. Prominent writer of “Islamic Masculinities”, Lahoucine Ouzgane, proposes the idea that masculinity is rooted in a fear of emasculation by other men.&lt;ref name=Darwish/&gt; Additionally, projecting homosexuality onto another man is often seen as a way to emasculate him while reaffirming one’s own superior virility.&lt;ref name=Darwish/&gt;

==Modern viewpoints==

Viewpoints regarding gender roles vary with different interpretations of the [[Quran]], different sects of the religion, and different cultural and locational regions.

===Salafiyyah===
[[Salafiyyah]] literally means "that which pertains to ancestry".&lt;ref name=fundamentalistislam&gt;Shehadeh, Lamia Rustum. The Idea of Women in Fundamentalist Islam. University Press of Florida, 2003. https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=2_VqocCYIa0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=salafiyyah women &amp;ots=UUbNEohgQT&amp;sig=s-pUdaq0n5Of7c45vqwf1GLpudY&lt;/ref&gt; It was first conceived by [[Muhammad Abduh]] and refers back to the first generation of Muslims who supported Muhammad during the seventh century.&lt;ref name=fundamentalistislam/&gt; It is an Arabic term that denotes [[fundamentalism]].&lt;ref name=fundamentalistislam/&gt;

The ideas of [[Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah bin Baz]] are characteristic of much of the salafiyyah sect. Bin Baz believed that the engagement of women in “male domains” separates them from their God-given nature, eventually leading to women's misery and demise.&lt;ref name=Sidani/&gt; He believed that women entering “male domains” posed a danger to Muslim society, eventually causing it to fall into moral decay.&lt;ref name=Sidani/&gt; Additionally, he asserted that a woman outside the home was a woman denying her true, God-given character.&lt;ref name=Sidani/&gt; He viewed the involvement of women in male domains as a detriment to the next generation, which he says may receive a worse education and less compassion from their mothers.&lt;ref name=BinBaz1988&gt;BinBaz, A. (1988), Islamic Fatwas, Darul-Qalam, Beirut.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BinBaz1985&gt;BinBaz, A. (1985), "Judgement about women's work", available at: www.binbaz.org.sa/display.asp?f=ibn00195 (accessed 24 November 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; BinBaz also thought that women should only work in certain fields—those that are within a woman's domain—such as female education, nursing and medical care. But even these must obey a strict separation of gender.&lt;ref name=BinBaz1985/&gt;

===Wasatiyyah===
The Qur'anic and prophetic terms for "moderation" are reflected in the word "wasatiyyah," which means the "middle way between extremes" and "upright without losing balance."&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Sadullah. IslamiCity, "Wasatiyyah -The Balanced Median." Last modified July 29, 2010. Accessed March 15, 2014. https://www.islamicity.com/articles/articles.asp?ref=IC1007-4239&amp;p=3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad [[Al-Ghazali]]'s (     ) ideas characterize much of the wasatiyyah school of thought. His ideas are shared by other notable and influential people including [[Yusuf Al-Qaradawi]], Abdel-Haleem AbuShaqua, and [[Hasan al-Turabi]].&lt;ref name=Sidani/&gt; Together they represent a growing modernist trend.&lt;ref name=Sidani/&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] indicated that Islam suggest a significant sense of equality between men and women.&lt;ref name=Sidani/&gt; He maintained that there are traditions created by people and not by God that slow women's development and keeps them in religious ignorance, which he believes results in the degradation of the whole Muslim community.&lt;ref name=Sidani/&gt; Ghazali asserts that women have been denied a say in their communities and have been restricted to domestic service.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ghazali, M. (1989), Al-Haq Al-Murr – The Sour Truth, Shurook Publishing, Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; He also called for a change in Islamic thinking in general and the reevaluation of cultural traditions that are attributed wrongly as central to the Islamic faith.&lt;ref name=Sidani/&gt;

====Fatema Mernissi====
In her writings, [[Fatema Mernissi]] remarks that “if women's rights are a problem for some modern Muslim men, it is neither because of the Qur'an nor the Prophet Muhammad, nor the Islamic tradition, but simply because those rights conflict with the interests of a male elite”.&lt;ref&gt;Mernissi, F. (1991), Women &amp; Islam, Blackwell Publishers, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; She questions the social norm a man is “dishonoured” if a woman in their family works outside of a domestic space. She asserts that in the male mind society is divided into an economically productive section that is public and male and a [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] that is private and female and that these two areas should not mix.&lt;ref name=Sidani/&gt;

====Heba Ra'uf====
Heba Ra'uf (born 1965) Ra'uf stresses the importance of new interpretations of the [[Quran]] and [[Sunnah]] (traditions and sayings of Muhammad). Ra'uf argues that the advancement of women's causes in Arab and Muslim societies requires a reworking of Islamic thought. She criticizes the efforts of those who draw their inspiration exclusively from Western feminism.&lt;ref name=Sidani/&gt;

Ra'uf dresses in the [[Muslim veil]].&lt;ref name=Sidani/&gt; This is a source of controversy within Islamic feminists. On the one hand, some feminists like Nawal El-Saadawi severely criticize the veil: “veiling and nakedness are two sides of the same coin. Both mean women are bodies without mind … ”.&lt;ref&gt;El-Saadawi, N. (1997), The Nawal El-Saadawi Reader, Zed books, London.&lt;/ref&gt; But Ra'uf sees wearing a veil as a means of liberation: “the veil neutralizes women's sexuality in the public sphere, making clear that they are citizens – not sexual objects”.&lt;ref&gt;Polter, J. (1997), "A place apart", Sojourners Magazine, May–June, available at: www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=magazine.article&amp;issue=soj9705&amp;article=970521.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ra'uf acknowledges that women belong in the public sphere, and she challenges any gender-based separation between the public and private spheres.&lt;ref name=elgawhary&gt;El-Gawhary, K. (1994), "It is time to launch a new [[women's liberation movement]] – an Islamic one (an interview with Heba Ra'uf)", Middle East Report, pp.26-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  She emphasizes that women's work should extend both into the private and the public sectors. “Breaking the dichotomy would give housewives more social esteem and would encourage working women to fulfill their psychological need to be good mothers and wives” &lt;ref name=elgawhary/&gt;

[[File:2007 0822collectionpart30278.JPG|250px|thumb|Heinrich August Jäschke]]
'''Heinrich August Jäschke''' (17 May 1817 in [[Herrnhut]] – 24 September 1883) was a German [[Tibetologist]] missionary and Bible translator. From 1857 to 1868 he was missionary of the [[Herrnhuter Brüdergemeine]] (the [[Moravian Church]] or Moravian Brethren) in [[Kyelang]], [[Lahaul]] District and [[Spiti]] in North India.&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Icke-Schwalbe, Gudrun Meier, ''Wissenschaftsgeschichte und gegenwärtige Forschungen in ...'' -  Staatliches Museum für Völkerkunde Dresden - 1990 Page 69 "For the word 'cross' Jäschke deemed it more advisable to adopt a word [brkyang-shing] which at least for its meaning represents 'a tree of extension' although it is rather a rack than an instrument of death as it consists of a four-cornered frame ...

The complete Bible was eventually published in 1948, more than ninety years after Jaeschke had begun his first translation work. eliyah tsetan phuntsog ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Jäschke has been called "the most distinguished linguist in the whole history of the [[Moravian Church]]" by James Hutton in his ''A History of the Moravian Missions'' (1923).&lt;ref name="Heinrich August Jäschke"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heinrich August Jäschke|url=http://www.moravianchurcharchives.org/thismonth/08%20sept%20jaeschke.pdf|publisher=Moravian Archives|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Heinrich August Jäschke was born on May 17, 1817 in [[Herrnhut]], Germany. He attended Moravian schools, where he stood out for his remarkable gift for learning new languages. His ties to Moravian schools continued in adult life as he taught in various schools in Germany and Denmark. In 1847, he became co-director of the Moravian boarding schools in Niesky, Germany. The following year, he was ordained.

==Tibetan Mission==
{{expand section|date=March 2017}}
Jäschke's gift for language made him an ideal choice for the Moravian mission in Western Tibet. So in 1856 Jäschke joined two missionaries, Wilhelm Heyde and Eduard Pagel, in what is today northern India.&lt;ref name="Heinrich August Jäschke"/&gt;

{{terrorism}}
The '''history of terrorism''' is a history of well-known and historically significant individuals, entities, and incidents associated, whether rightly or wrongly, with [[terrorism]]. Scholars agree that terrorism is a [[definition of terrorism|disputed term]], and very few of those labeled terrorists describe themselves as such. It is common for opponents in a violent conflict to describe the other side as terrorists or as practicing terrorism.&lt;ref name=tws11janbcvc&gt;{{cite news|author1=Paul Reynolds |author2=quoting David Hannay |author3=Former UK ambassador |title= UN staggers on road to reform|quote= This would end the argument that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter...|publisher= BBC News|date= 14 September 2005|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4244842.stm|accessdate= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on how broadly the term is defined, the roots and practice of terrorism can be traced at least to the 1st-century AD [[Sicarii Zealots]], though some dispute whether the group, which [[assassination|assassinated]] collaborators with Roman rule in the province of [[Judea]], was in fact terrorist. The first use in English of the term 'terrorism' occurred during the [[French Revolution]]'s [[Reign of Terror]], when the [[Jacobins]], who ruled the revolutionary state, employed violence, including mass executions by guillotine, to compel obedience to the state and intimidate regime enemies.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/opinion/28furstenberg.html|title=Opinion - Bush’s Dangerous Liaisons|first=François|last=Furstenberg|date=28 October 2007|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association of the term only with state violence and intimidation lasted until the mid-19th century, when it began to be associated with non-governmental groups. [[Anarchism]], often in league with rising [[nationalism]] and [[anti-monarchism]], was the most prominent ideology linked with terrorism. Near the end of the 19th century, anarchist groups or individuals committed assassinations of a Russian Tsar and a U.S. President.

In the 20th century, terrorism continued to be associated with a vast array of anarchist, socialist, fascist and nationalist groups, many of them engaged in '[[third world]]' anti-colonial struggles. Some scholars also labeled as terrorist the systematic internal violence and intimidation practiced by states such as the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|Stalinist Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="NaziTerror"&gt;{{Citation|title=Nazi Terror Begins |publisher=United States Holocaust Museum |date=20 June 2014 |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005686}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foundations"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin A.

The term terrorist is believed to have originated during the [[Reign of Terror]] (September 5, 1793{{snds}}July 28, 1794) in France. It was a period of eleven months during the [[French Revolution]] when the ruling [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] employed violence, including mass executions by [[guillotine]], in order to intimidate the regime's enemies and compel obedience to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/recent/sept_11/changing_faces_01.shtml|title=BBC - History - The Changing Faces of Terrorism|date=|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jacobins, most famously Robespierre, sometimes referred to themselves as "terrorists".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; Some modern scholars, however, do not consider the Reign of Terror a form of terrorism, in part because it was carried out by the French state.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chialand, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early terrorism==
[[File:Asabah2.jpg|thumb|right|Artistic rendering of [[Hassan-i Sabbah]]]]

Scholars dispute whether the roots of terrorism date back to the 1st century and the [[Sicarii Zealots]], to the 11th century and the Al-[[Hashshashin]], to the 19th century and the [[Fenian Brotherhood]] and [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]], or to other eras.&lt;ref name="cdi.org"&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/friendlyversion/printversion.cfm?documentID=1502 History of Terrorism article by Mark Burgess] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511140810/http://www.cdi.org/friendlyversion/printversion.cfm?documentID=1502 |date=2012-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The Sicarii and the Hashshashin are described below, while the Fenian Brotherhood and Narodnaya Volya are discussed in the 19th Century sub-section. Other pre-Reign of Terror historical events sometimes associated with terrorism include the [[Gunpowder Plot]], an attempt to destroy the English [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berr.gov.uk/fireworks/download/FW1434_Keystage2_07.pdf] http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090609003228/http://www.berr.gov.uk/fireworks/download/FW1434_Keystage2_07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1st century CE, the [[Zealotry|Jewish Zealots]] in [[Judaea Province]] rebelled, killing prominent collaborators with Roman rule.&lt;ref name="cdi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.56&lt;/ref&gt; In 6 CE, according to contemporary historian [[Josephus]], [[Judas of Galilee]] formed a small and more extreme offshoot of the Zealots, the [[Sicarii]] ("dagger men").&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.68"/&gt; Their efforts were also directed against Jewish "collaborators," including temple priests, [[Sadducees]], [[Herodians]], and other wealthy elites.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephus, the Sicarii would hide short daggers under their cloaks, mingle with crowds at large festivals, murder their victims, and then disappear into the panicked crowds. Their most successful assassination was of the [[List of High Priests of Israel|High Priest of Israel]] Jonathan.&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.68"/&gt;

In the late 11th century, the [[Hashshashin]] (a.k.a. the Assassins) arose, an offshoot of the [[Isma'ili]] sect of [[Shia]] [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref name="Rapoport, David 1984. p.658"&gt;Rapoport, David. "Fear and Trembling: Terrorism in Three Religious Traditions." ''American Political Science Review'', 1984. p.658&lt;/ref&gt; Led by [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] and opposed to [[Fatimid]] rule, the Hashshashin militia seized Alamut and other fortress strongholds across Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, Peter. ''The Castles of the Assassins''. New York: Linden Press, 2001. p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Hashshashin forces were too small to challenge enemies militarily, so they assassinated city governors and military commanders in order to create alliances with militarily powerful neighbors. For example, they killed Janah al-Dawla, ruler of [[Homs]], to please [[Ridwan of Aleppo]], and assassinated [[Mawdud]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] emir of [[Mosul]], as a favor to the regent of [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;Daftary, Farhad. ''The Assassin Legends: Myths of the Isma'ilis''. London: I. B. Tauris, 1995. p.42&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hashshashin]] also carried out assassinations as retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, Marshall G. S. ''The Secret Order of Assassins: The Struggle of the Early Nizari Ismai'lis Against the Islamic World''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005. p.83&lt;/ref&gt; Under some definitions of terrorism, such [[assassinations]] do not qualify as terrorism, since killing a political leader does not intimidate political enemies or inspire revolt.&lt;ref name="cdi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.68"&gt;Chaliand, Gerard.

The [[Sons of Liberty]] was a clandestine group that formed in [[Boston]] and [[New York City]] in the 1770s. It had a political agenda of independence of Britain's American colonies. The groups engaged in several acts that could be considered terroristic and used the deeds for propaganda purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.varsitytutors.com/earlyamerica/early-america-review/volume-1/sons-liberty-patriots-terrorists|title=Sons of Liberty: Patriots or Terrorists? - Archiving Early America|website=www.varsitytutors.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gunpowder Plot==

On November 5, 1605, a group of conspirators led by [[Robert Catesby]] attempted to destroy the English Parliament on its State Opening by King James I. They planned in secret to detonate a large quantity of [[gunpowder]] placed beneath the [[Palace of Westminster]]. The gunpowder was procured and placed by [[Guy Fawkes]]. The group intended to enact a coup by killing King James I and the members of both houses of Parliament. The conspirators planned to make one of the king's children a puppet monarch and then restore the Catholic faith to England. The conspirator leased a coal cellar beneath the House of Lords and began stockpiling gunpowder in 1604. As well as its primary targets, it would have killed hundreds, if not thousands, of Londoners – the most devastating act of terrorism in Britain's history, plunging the nation into a religious war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4671842/gunpowder-plot-1605-robert-catesby-guy-fawkes-houses-of-parliament/|title=How Britain's first terrorists almost changed the course of history with the Gunpowder Plot|date=5 November 2017|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; English spymasters uncovered the plot and caught Guy Fawkes with the gunpowder beneath Parliament. The other conspirators fled to Holbeach in Staffordshire. A shoot out on November 8 with authorities led to the deaths of Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy and the brothers Christopher and John Wright. The rest were captured.  Fawkes and seven others were tried and executed in January 1606.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/simon-adams/gunpowder-plot-terror-and-toleration|title=The Gunpowder Plot: Terror and Toleration - History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planned attack has become known as the Gunpowder Plot and is commemorated in Britain every November 5 with fireworks displays and large bonfires with effigies of Guy Fawkes and [[the Pope]] are often burned. Comparisons are often drawn between gunpowder plot and modern religious terrorism, such as the attacks in the US by Islamic terrorists on [[9/11]] 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1488402/Gunpowder-Plot-was-Englands-911-says-historian.html|title=Gunpowder Plot was England's 9/11, says historian|first=Nick|last=Britten|date=21 April 2005|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Gunpowder Plot: Terror and Faith in 1605; Author Antonia Fraser; published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
[[File:Fenian guy fawkesr1867reduced.png|thumb|250px|"The Fenian Guy Fawkes" by [[John Tenniel]], published in [[Punch magazine]], on 28 December 1867]]

One of the earliest groups to utilize modern terrorist techniques was arguably the [[Fenian Brotherhood]] and its offshoot the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/adulted/coursesbycode/hn258/|title=Terrorism: From the Fenians to Al Qaeda|accessdate=2014-01-09}}http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/terrorism/&lt;/ref&gt; They were both founded in 1858 as revolutionary, militant nationalist and Catholic groups, both in Ireland and amongst the emigre community in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Freedom, by Richard English Publisher: Pan Books (2 November 2007), {{ISBN|0-330-42759-8}} p179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irish Freedom, by Richard English Publisher: Pan Books (2 November 2007), {{ISBN|0-330-42759-8}} p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

After centuries of continued British rule, and influenced most recently from the devastating effects of the 1840s [[Irish potato famine]], these revolutionary fraternal organisations were founded with the aim of establishing an independent republic in Ireland, and began carrying out frequent acts of violence in metropolitan Britain to achieve their aims through intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Freedom, by Richard English Publisher: Pan Books (2 November 2007), {{ISBN|0-330-42759-8}} p3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, members of the movement's leadership were arrested and convicted for organizing an [[Fenian Rising|armed uprising]]. While being transferred to [[Belle Vue Gaol|prison]], the police van in which they were being transported was intercepted and a [[police]] sergeant was shot in the rescue. A bolder rescue attempt of another Irish radical incarcerated in [[Clerkenwell Prison]], was made in the same year: an explosion to demolish the prison wall killed 12 people and caused many injuries. The bombing enraged the British public, causing a panic over the Fenian threat.

Although the Irish Republican Brotherhood condemned the Clerkenwell Outrage as a "dreadful and deplorable event", the organisation returned to bombings in Britain in 1881 to 1885, with the [[Fenian dynamite campaign]], beginning one of the first modern terror campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whelehan|first=Niall|title=The Dynamiters: Irish Nationalism and Political Violence in the Wider World 1867–1900|year=2012|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of earlier forms of terrorism based on political assassination, this campaign used modern, timed explosives with the express aim of sowing fear in the very heart of metropolitan Britain, in order to achieve political gains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theirishstory.com/2012/02/13/one-skilled-scientist-is-worth-an-army-the-fenian-dynamite-campaign-1881-85/#.UkniH3-tbXQ|title=The Fenian Dynamite campaign 1881–85|accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; – ([[Prime minister]] [[William Ewart Gladstone]] was partly influenced to disestablish the [[Anglican Church in Ireland]] as a gesture by the Clerkenwell bombing). The campaign also took advantage of the greater global integration of the times, and the bombing was largely funded and organised by the [[Fenian Brotherhood]] in the United States.

The first police unit to combat terrorism was established in 1883 by the [[Metropolitan Police]], initially as a small section of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]]. It was known as the [[Special Irish Branch]], and was trained in counter terrorism techniques to combat the Irish Republican Brotherhood. The unit's name was changed to Special Branch as the unit's remit steadily widened over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Secret War Exhibition, Imperial War Museum London&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarchism and "propaganda of the deed"===
[[File:I Grinevizky.jpg|170px|thumb|right|[[Ignacy Hryniewiecki]], a terrorist who assassinated Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]]]]

The concept of "[[propaganda of the deed]]" (or "propaganda by the deed", from the French ''propagande par le fait'') advocated physical [[violence]] or other provocative public acts against political enemies in order to inspire mass rebellion or [[revolution]]. One of the first individuals associated with this concept, the Italian revolutionary [[Carlo Pisacane]] (1818{{ndash}}1857), wrote in his "Political Testament" (1857) that "ideas spring from deeds and not the other way around". [[Anarchist]] [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814{{ndash}}1876), in his "Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis" (1870) stated that "we must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/letter-frenchman.htm|title=Works of Mikhail Bakunin 1870|author=Mikhail Bakunin|date=|work=marxists.org|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French [[anarchist]] [[Paul Brousse]] (1844{{ndash}}1912) popularized the phrase "propaganda of the deed"; in 1877 he cited as examples the 1871 [[Paris Commune]] and a workers' demonstration in [[Berne]] provocatively using the socialist red flag.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]]''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, the slogan had begun to be used{{by whom|date=April 2015}} to refer to bombings, [[regicide]]s and [[tyrannicide]]s. Reflecting this new understanding of the term, in 1895 Italian anarchist [[Errico Malatesta]] described "propaganda by the deed" (which he opposed the use of) as violent communal insurrections meant to ignite an imminent revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm|title=Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume One - ,  - Black Rose Books|date=|work=blackrosebooks.net|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in Russia in 1878, [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]] (''Народная Воля'' in Russian; ''People's Will'' in English) was a revolutionary anarchist group inspired by [[Sergei Nechayev]] and by "propaganda by the deed" theorist Pisacane.&lt;ref name="cdi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffman, Bruce 1998. p. 5"/&gt; The group developed ideas—such as [[targeted killing]] of the "leaders of oppression"—that would become the hallmark of subsequent violence by small non-state groups, and they were convinced that the developing technologies of the age—such as the invention of dynamite, which they were the first anarchist group to make widespread use of&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Terrorism'', by Walter Laqueur, Transaction Publishers, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7658-0799-8}}, p. 92 [https://books.google.com/books?id=RlqQHKpLfL8C&amp;dq=dynamite+terrorism+history&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt;—enabled them to strike directly and with discrimination.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Attempting to spark a popular revolt against Russian Tsardom, the group killed prominent political figures by gun and bomb, and on March 13, 1881, assassinated Russia's Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].&lt;ref name="cdi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffman, Bruce 1998. p. 5"&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The assassination, by a bomb that also killed the Tsar's attacker, [[Ignacy Hryniewiecki]], failed to spark the expected revolution, and an ensuing crackdown brought the group to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual Europeans also engaged in politically motivated violence. For example, in 1893, [[Auguste Vaillant]], a French [[Anarchism|anarchist]], threw a bomb in the French [[Chamber of Deputies]] in which one person was injured.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1894/02/06/archives/the-guillotines-sure-work-details-of-the-execution-of-vaillant-the.html The Guillotine's Sure Work; Details of the Execution of Vaillant, the Anarchist]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1984-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to Vaillant's bombing and other bombings and assassination attempts, the French government restricted [[freedom of the press]] by passing a set of [[law]]s that became pejoratively known as the ''[[lois scélérates]]'' ("villainous laws"). In the years 1894 to 1896 anarchists killed President of France [[Marie Francois Carnot]], Prime Minister of Spain [[Antonio Cánovas del Castillo]], and the Empress of Austria-Hungary, [[Elisabeth of Bavaria]].

===The United States===
Prior to the [[American Civil War]], [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] (1800{{ndash}}1859) advocated and practiced armed opposition to [[slavery]], leading several attacks between 1856 and 1859, the most famous attack was launched in 1859 against the [[Harpers Ferry Armory|armory]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]]. Local forces soon recaptured the fort and Brown was tried and executed for [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/22/AR2005042201172_pf.html | work=The Washington Post | title=The Good Terrorist | first=David W. | last=Blight |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biographer of Brown has written that Brown's purpose was "to force the nation into a new political pattern by creating terror."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Scott, ''The Secret Six: John Brown and the Abolitionist Movement'' (Murphys, Calif.: Uncommon Books, 1979, 1983), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the 150th anniversary of Brown's death, prominent news publications debated over whether or not Brown should be considered a terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2009/dec/02/john-brown-civil-war| work=The Guardian (UK) |title=Let's debate John Brown: terrorist, or no?| first=Michael|last=Tomasky|date=December 2, 2009|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/opinion/02reynolds.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=0|work=New York Times| title=Freedom's Martyr|first=David S.|last=Reynolds|date=December 1, 2009|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/opinion/02horwitz.html?ref=opinion|work=New York Times| title=The 9/11 of 1859|first=Tony|last=Horwitz|date=December 1, 2009|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], on December 24, 1865, six [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veterans created the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK).&lt;ref&gt;Horn, 1939, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The KKK used violence, lynching, murder and acts of intimidation such as [[cross burning]] to oppress [[African Americans]] in particular, and it created a sensation with its masked forays' dramatic nature.&lt;ref name="Jackson 1992 ed., pp. 241-242"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/filelink.html?file=/publications/terror/terror2000_2001.pdf|title=Terrorism 2000/2001|accessdate=2009-03-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320174902/https://www.fbi.gov/publications/terror/terror2000_2001.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KKK has at times been politically powerful, and at various times it controlled the governments of [[Tennessee]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Indiana]] and [[South Carolina]], as well as several legislatures in [[Southern United States|the South]].&lt;ref&gt;Marty Gitlin, ''The Ku Klux Klan: A Guide to an American Subculture'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/library/2848.htm|title=ISL: Ku Klux Klan in Indiana|website=www.in.gov|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ottoman Empire===
Several nationalist groups used violence against an [[Ottoman Empire]] in apparent decline. One was the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (in Armenian ''Dashnaktsuthium'', or "The Federation"), a revolutionary movement founded in [[Tiflis]] (Russian Transcaucasia) in 1890 by [[Christapor Mikaelian]]. Many members had been part of [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]] or the [[Hunchakian Revolutionary Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Balakian, Peter. ''The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response.''

Also inspired by Narodnaya Volya, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) was a revolutionary movement founded in 1893 by Hristo Tatarchev in the Ottoman-controlled Macedonian territories.&lt;ref name="Ross, Jeffrey Ian 2006. p.34"&gt;Ross, Jeffrey Ian.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.189&lt;/ref&gt; On July 20, 1903, the group incited the Ilinden uprising in the Ottoman villayet of Monastir.

==Early 20th century==
[[File:Minutos previos al atentado en Sarajevo.jpg|thumb|The assassination of the heir to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], precipitated a [[First World War|global war]]]]

Revolutionary nationalism continued to motivate political violence in the 20th century, much of it directed against western colonial powers. The [[Irish Republican Army]] campaigned against the British in the 1910s and inspired the [[Zionism|Zionist]] groups [[Hagannah]], [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] to fight the British throughout the 1930s in the Palestine mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, J.

The women's [[suffrage movement]] in the UK also committed terrorist attacks prior to the [[First World War]]. There were three phases of [[Women's Social and Political Union|WSPU]] militancy in 1905, 1908, 1913; including civil disobedience, destruction of public property and arson and bombings. Most notably, The WSPU burned down Government Minister, and future Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]]'s house&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Rowland|first= Peter|authorlink= Peter Rowland|title= David Lloyd George:a biography|publisher= Macmillan|page= 228|year= 1978|url= https://books.google.com/?id=u5WfAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; (despite his support for women's suffrage).

Political assassinations continued, resulting in the assassinations of King [[Umberto I of Italy]], killed in July 1900 and US President [[William McKinley]] in September 1901. Political violence became especially widespread in [[Imperial Russia]], and several ministers were killed in the opening years of the 20th century. The highest-ranking was prime minister [[Pyotr Stolypin]], killed in 1911 by Dmitry Bogrov, a spy for the secret police in several anarchist, socialist and other revolutionary groups.&lt;ref&gt;Fontanka 16: The Tsars' Secret Police, by Charles A. Ruud, Sergei A. Stepanov&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]], one of a group of six assassins, shot and killed [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], heir to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] throne, and his wife, [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg]], in [[Sarajevo]], the capital of the Condominion  of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The assassinations produced widespread shock across Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/100-years-since-the-assassination-of-archduke-franz-ferdinand-the-shot-that-sparked-the-first-world-9570029.html|title=100 years since the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand: How did|date=28 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting in motion a series of events which led to [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/08/first-world-war-franz-ferdinand-sarajevo|title=First World War: Reports of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo|date=8 November 2008|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany and [[Stalin]]'s rule in [[the Soviet Union]] practiced [[state terror]] systematically and on a massive and unprecedented scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Hitler vs. Stalin: Who Was Worse?|publisher= New York Review of Books|date= 27 January 2011|url= http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2011/jan/27/hitler-vs-stalin-who-was-worse/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Stalin regime branded its opponents with the label "terrorist".&lt;ref&gt;

===Irish independence===
In an action called the [[Easter Rising]] or [[Easter Rebellion]], on April 24, 1916, members of the [[Irish Volunteers]] and the [[Irish Citizen Army]] seized the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|Dublin General Post Office]] and several other buildings, proclaiming an independent Irish Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.185&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion failed militarily but was a success for [[physical force Irish republicanism]], leaders of the uprising becoming Irish heroes after their eventual execution by the British government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/easterrising/aftermath/af01.shtml|title= BBC - History - 1916 Easter Rising - Aftermath - The Executions|date= |work= bbc.co.uk|accessdate= 27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sackville Street (Dublin) after the 1916 Easter Rising.JPG|left|thumb|Rubble in the streets of [[Dublin]] after the failed [[Easter Rising]] in 1916 against British rule]]

Shortly after the rebellion, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] and others founded the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), which from 1916 to 1923{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} carried out numerous attacks against symbols of British power. For example, it attacked over 300 police stations simultaneously just before Easter 1920,&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, p.185: "Just before Easter 1920, the IRA simultaneously attacked more than 300 police stations..."&lt;/ref&gt; and, in November 1920, publicly killed a dozen police officers and burned down the Liverpool docks and warehouses, an action that became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Peter. ''Mick: The Real Michael Collins''. p.241&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of warfare, London agreed to the 1921 Anglo-Irish treaty creating a free Irish state encompassing 26 of the island's 32 counties.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Tim. ''Michael Collins: The Man Who Made Ireland.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002. p.92&lt;/ref&gt; IRA tactics were an inspiration to other groups, including the [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine Mandate]]'s [[Zionism|Zionists]],&lt;ref name="Colin Shindler p.177"&gt;Colin Shindler, ''The Land Beyond Promise:Israel, Likud and the Zionist Dream'', I.B.Tauris, 2001 p.177&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Special Operations Executive|British special operations]] during World War II.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Hugh Dalton letter to Lord Halifax 2/7/1940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thefirstpost.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/5754,opinion,how-churchill-helped-britain-perfect-terrorism] article by Matthew Carr Author The Infernal Machine: A History of Terrorism {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081202161231/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/5754,opinion,how-churchill-helped-britain-perfect-terrorism |date= December 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRA are considered by some the innovators of modern terrorism as the British would replicate and build upon the tactics used against by the IRA in World War II. [[Tony Geraghty]] in ''The Irish War: The Hidden Conflict Between the IRA and British Intelligence'' wrote:

{{quote|The Irish [thanks to the example set by Collins and followed by the SOE] can thus claim that their resistance provide the originating impulse for resistance to tyrannies worse than any they had to endure themselves. And the Irish resistance as Collins led it, showed the rest of the world an economical way to fight wars the only sane way they can be fought in the age of the Nuclear bomb.&lt;ref name=FootGeraghty&gt;Geraghty (1998), p.347&lt;/ref&gt;|[[M. R. D. Foot]], who wrote several official histories of SOE}}

From January 1939 to March 1940, the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) carried out a campaign of bombing and [[sabotage]] against the civil, economic, and military infrastructure of Britain. It was known as the [[S-Plan|S-Plan or Sabotage Campaign]]. During the campaign, the IRA carried out almost 300 attacks and acts of sabotage in Britain, killing seven people and injuring 96.&lt;ref&gt;Dingley, James. ''The IRA: The Irish Republican Army''. ABC-CLIO, 2012. p.82&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the casualties occurred in the [[1939 Coventry bombing|Coventry bombing]] on 25 August 1939.

===Mandatory Palestine===
{{see also|Jewish insurgency in Palestine|1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|List of killings and massacres in Mandatory Palestine}}

Following the [[1929 Hebron massacre]] of 67 Jews in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], the [[Zionism|Zionist]] militia [[Haganah]] transformed itself into a paramilitary force. In 1931, however, the more militant [[Irgun]] broke away from Haganah, objecting to Haganah's policy of [[Havlagah|restraint]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. P. 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Avraham Tehomi]],&lt;ref&gt;Zadka, Saul.

''Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence. '' Berkeley, University of California Press, 2001. P. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Irgun sought to aggressively defend Jews from Arab attacks. Its tactic of attacking Arab communities, including the bombing of a crowded Arab market, is considered{{by whom|date=October 2017}} among the first examples of terrorism directed against civilians.&lt;ref name=hoffman1998-26&gt;Hoffman 1998, P. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;
After the British, in the [[White Paper of 1939]], placed severe restrictions on Jewish immigration into Palestine and set forth a vision of a single state with an Arab majority,&lt;ref&gt;Ehud Sprinzak, [https://books.google.com/books?id=M23n0qDTvkQC&amp;pg=PA35 ''Brother Against Brother: Violence and Extremism in Israeli Politics from Altalena to the Rabin Assassination,''] Simon and Schuster, 1999 p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; the Irgun began a campaign against British rule by assassinating police, capturing British government buildings and arms, and sabotaging British railways.&lt;ref name="Sachar, Howard 2007. P. 247."&gt;Sachar, Howard. ''A History of Israel: From the Rise of Zionism to Our Time''. New York: Knopf, 2007. P. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; Irgun's best-known attack targeted the [[King David Hotel bombing|King David Hotel]] in Jerusalem, parts of which housed the headquarters of the British civil and military administrations. The bombing, in 1946, killed ninety-one people and injured forty-six, making it the most deadly attack during the Mandate era. This attack was sharply condemned by the organized leadership of the Yishuv, and further widened the gulf between [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s [[Hagana]] and Begin's Irgun. Following the bombing, Ben-Gurion called Irgun an "enemy of the Jewish people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jpost.com/Features/In-Thespotlight/This-Week-in-History-The-King-David-Hotel-bombing|title= This Week in History: The King David Hotel bombing|date= |work= The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com|accessdate= 27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tclarke81"&gt;[[Thurston Clarke|Clarke, Thurston]].

Operating in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] in the 1930s, [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]] (1882–1935) organized and established the [[Black Hand (Palestine)|Black Hand]], a Palestinian nationalist militia. He recruited and arranged military training for [[peasant]]s, and by 1935 had enlisted between 200 and 800 men. Al-Qassam obtained a [[fatwa]] from Shaykh Badr al-Din al-Taji al-Hasani, the [[Mufti]] of [[Damascus]], authorizing armed resistance against the British and against the Jews of Palestine. Black Hand cells were equipped with bombs and firearms, which they used to kill Jews.&lt;ref name=segev&gt;{{cite book |last= Segev |first= Tom |authorlink= Tom Segev |title= One Palestine, Complete |year= 1999 |publisher= Metropolitan Books |isbn= 0-8050-4848-0 |pages= 360–362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shai Lachman, "Arab Rebellion and Terrorism in Palestine 1929-39: The Case of Sheikh Izz al-Din al-Qassam and His Movement", in ''Zionism and Arabism in Palestine and Israel'', edited by Elie Kedourie and Sylvia G. Haim, Frank Cass, London, 1982, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Although al-Qassam's revolt was unsuccessful in his lifetime, many organizations gained inspiration from his example.&lt;ref name=segev/&gt; He became a popular hero and an inspiration to subsequent Arab militants, who in the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936{{ndash}}39 Arab revolt]], called themselves Qassamiyun, followers of al-Qassam. The [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]], the military wing of [[Hamas]], as well as the [[Qassam rocket|rockets]] they developed, take their names after Qassam.

[[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] (''Lohamei Herut Yisrael'', a.k.a. "Freedom Fighters for Israel", a.k.a. the Stern Gang) was a [[Revisionist Zionism|revisionist Zionist]] group that splintered off from [[Irgun]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=hoffman1998-26/&gt; [[Abraham Stern]] formed Lehi from disaffected Irgun members after Irgun agreed to a truce with Britain in 1940.&lt;ref name="Sachar, Howard 2007. P. 247."/&gt; Lehi assassinated prominent politicians as a strategy. For example, on November 6, 1944, [[Lord Moyne]], the [[uK|British]] Minister of State for the Middle East, was assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. P. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; The act was controversial among Zionist militant groups, [[Hagannah]] sympathizing with the British and launching [[the Hunting Season|a massive man-hunt]] against members of Lehi and Irgun. After Israel's 1948 founding, Lehi formally dissolved and its members became integrated into the [[Israeli Defense Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;Pedahzur, Ami.

===Resistance during WWII===
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}
Some of the tactics of the [[Resistance during World War II|guerrilla, partisan, and resistance movements]] organised and supplied by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during [[World War II]], according to historian M. R. D. Foot, can be considered terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;Resistance - An Analysis of European Resistance to Nazism 1940–1945, by M. R. D. Foot&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Keegan as quoted in The Irish War, by Tony Geraghty&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin Gubbins]], a key leader within the British [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE), made sure the organization drew much of its inspiration from the IRA.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thefirstpost.co.uk"/&gt;

On the eve of [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], the [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] organised with the [[French Resistance]] the complete destruction of the rail&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cross.html|title= Programmes - Most Popular - All 4|date= |work= Channel 4|accessdate= 27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and communication infrastructure of western France&lt;ref&gt;SOE in France. An Account of the Work of the British Special Operations Executive in France 1940–1944. By M. R. D. Foot (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; the largest coordinated attack of its kind in history&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Churchill's Secret Army, Carlton UK, Channel 4, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Allied supreme commander [[Dwight Eisenhower]] later wrote that "the disruption of enemy rail communications, the harassing of German road moves and the continual and increasing strain placed on German security services throughout occupied Europe by the organised forces of Resistance, played a very considerable part in our complete and final victory".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/soe_04.shtml] http://www.bbc.co.uk/news&lt;/ref&gt;

The SOE also conducted operations in Africa, the Middle East and the Far East.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The work of the SOE received recognition in 2009 with a memorial in London, however there are differing views on the morality of the SOE's actions; the British military historian [[John Keegan]] wrote:
{{quote|We must recognise that our response to the scourge of terrorism is compromised by what we did through SOE. The justification&amp;nbsp;... That we had no other means of striking back at the enemy&amp;nbsp;... is exactly the argument used by the Red Brigades, the Baader-Meinhoff gang, the PFLP, the IRA and every other half-articulate terrorist organisation on Earth. Futile to argue that we were a democracy and Hitler a tyrant. Means besmirch ends. SOE besmirched Britain.&lt;ref&gt;
Geraghty (1998), p.346
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Anti-colonial struggles (Cold War)==
After World War II, largely successful [[anti-imperialism|anti-colonial]] campaigns were launched against the collapsing European empires, as many World War II resistance groups became militantly anti-colonial. The [[Viet Minh]], for example, which had fought against the Japanese, now fought against the returning [[First Indochina War|French]] colonists. In the Middle East, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] used bombings and assassinations against British rule in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Lia, Brynjar 2006. p.53"/&gt; Also during the 1950s, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) in French-controlled Algeria and the [[EOKA]] in British-controlled Cyprus waged [[guerrilla]] and open war against colonial powers.&lt;ref name="Hoffman, Bruce 1998. p. 33"&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1964 Brinks Hotel bombing.JPG|thumb|Aftermath of the [[1964 Brinks Hotel bombing]] in Vietnam.]]
In the 1960s, inspired by [[Mao Zedong|Mao's]] Chinese revolution of 1949 and [[Fidel Castro|Castro's]] [[Cuban revolution]] of 1959, national independence movements often fused nationalist and [[socialism|socialist]] impulses. This was the case with Spain's [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], the [[Front de libération du Québec]], and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]{{Clarify|date=April 2009}}.&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.227"&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.227&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s and 1970s violent [[left-wing politics|left wing]] and revolutionary groups were on the rise, sympathizing with [[Third World]] guerrilla movements and seeking to spark anti-capitalist revolts. Such groups included the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] in Turkey{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}, Armenia's [[ASALA]],&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.227"/&gt; the [[Japanese Red Army]], the [[German Red Army Faction]], the [[Italian Red Brigades]], and, in the United States, the [[Weather Underground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terrorism.about.com/od/originshistory/a/LeftWingTerror.htm|title=Where Did Left Wing Terrorism Go?|author=Amy Zalman|date=|work=About.com News &amp; Issues|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalist groups such as the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] and the [[Tamil tigers]] also began operations at this time.

Throughout the [[Cold War]], both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] made extensive use of violent nationalist organizations to carry on a war by proxy. For example, Soviet and Chinese military advisers provided training and support to the [[Viet Cong]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam: A History, Stanley Karnow,1983&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union also provided military support to the [[PLO]] during the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/12/how-the-soviet-union-transformed-terrorism How the Soviet Union Transformed Terrorism]/250433/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fidel Castro]] during the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/98822/Fidel-Castro|title=Fidel Castro|date=|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States funded groups such as the [[Contras]] in Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/PS157/assignment%20files%20public/TOWER%20EXCERPTS.htm|title=Tower Commission Report Excerpts|date=|work=ucsb.edu|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Islamic Terrorism|violent Islamic militants]] of the late 20th and early 21st century had been funded in the 1980s by the United States and the UK because they were fighting the USSR in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;''The Power of Nightmares'', BBC, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crile|first=George|title=Charlie Wilson's War|publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |year=2004|pages=111–112|isbn=0-8021-4124-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF) was a [[New Left]] group founded in 1968 by [[Andreas Baader]] and [[Ulrike Meinhof]] in West Germany. Inspired by [[Che Guevara]], Maoist socialism, and the [[Vietcong]], the group sought to raise awareness of the Vietnamese and Palestinian independence movements through kidnappings, taking embassies hostage, bank robberies, assassinations, bombings, and attacks on U.S. air bases. The group is best known for 1977's "[[German Autumn]]". The buildup leading to [[German Autumn]] began on April 7, when the RAF shot Federal Prosecutor [[Siegfried Buback]]. On July 30, it shot [[Jürgen Ponto]], then head of the Dresdner Bank, in a failed kidnapping attempt; on September 5, the group kidnapped [[Hanns Martin Schleyer]] (a former SS officer and an important West German industrialist), executing him on October 19.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenau, Bernhard.

The [[Red Brigades]] were a New Left group founded by [[Renato Curcio]] and [[Alberto Franceschini]] in 1970 that sought to create a revolutionary state. The group carried out a series of bombings and kidnappings until Curcio and Franceschini were arrested in the mid-1970s. Their successor as leader, [[Mario Moretti]], led the group toward more militarized and violent actions, including the kidnapping of former Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]] on March 16, 1978. Moro was killed 56 days later. This led to an all-out assault on the group by Italian law enforcement and security forces and condemnation from Italian left-wing radicals and even imprisoned ex-leaders of the Brigades. The group lost most of its social support and public opinion turned strongly against it. In 1984, the group split, the majority faction becoming the Communist Combatant Party (Red Brigades-PCC) and the minority faction reconstituting itself as the Union of Combatant Communists (Red Brigades-UCC). Members of these groups carried out a handful of assassinations before almost all were arrested in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ed Vulliamy]], [http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/vinciguerra.p2.etc_graun_5dec1990.html Secret agents, freemasons, fascists... and a top-level campaign of political 'destabilisation'], ''[[The Guardian]]'', December 5, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
In Kenya, because of the seeming ongoing failure of the Kenyan African Union to obtain political reforms from the British through peaceful means, radical activists within the KAU set up a splinter group and organised a more militant kind of nationalism. By 1952 The Mau Mau consisted of Kikuyu fighters, along with some Embu and Meru recruits. The Mau Mau carried out attacks on political opponents, loyalist villages, raiding white settler farms and destroying livestock. The British colonial administration declared a state of emergency and British forces were sent to Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1952/oct/21/mau-mau-terrorism-in-kenya|title=MAU MAU TERRORISM IN KENYA|date=|work=millbanksystems.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of fighting was between loyalist and Mau Mau Kikuyu, so many scholars today now consider it a Kikuyu civil war.

This period also saw the rise of what is sometimes categorized as [[Single issue terrorism]]. If terrorism is the extension of domestic politics by other means, just as war is for diplomacy, then this represents the extension of [[pressure groups]] into violent action. Notable examples that grow in this period are [[Anti-abortion terrorism]] and [[Environmental terrorism]].

[[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] (a.k.a.

It is led by [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]], who has been accused of participation in the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. In 1981, the group assassinated Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]].

[[Aum Shinrikyo]], now known as Aleph, was a Japanese [[New religious movement|religious group]] founded by [[Shoko Asahara]] in 1984 as a yogic meditation group. Later, in 1990, Asahara and 24 other members campaigned for election to the House of Representatives under the banner of Shinri-tō (Supreme Truth Party). None were voted in, and the group began to militarize. Between 1990 and 1995, the group attempted several apparently unsuccessful [[biological terrorism|violent attacks]] using the methods of [[biological warfare]], using [[Botulinum toxin|botulin toxin]] and [[anthrax]] spores.&lt;ref name=olson/&gt; On June 28, 1994, Aum Shinrikyo members released sarin gas from several sites in the Kaichi Heights neighborhood of [[Matsumoto, Nagano|Matsumoto]], Japan, killing eight and injuring 200 in what became known as the [[Matsumoto incident]].&lt;ref name=olson&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol5no4/olson.htm CDC website], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], ''Aum Shinrikyo: Once and Future Threat?'', Kyle B.

In May 1995, Asahara and other senior leaders were arrested and the group's membership rapidly decreased.

In 1985, [[Air India Flight 182]] flying from Canada was blown up by a bomb while in Irish airspace, killing 329 people, including 280 Canadian citizens, mostly of Indian birth or descent, and 22 Indians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/airindia/victims.html In Depth: Air India] http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/memorial-for-air-india-victims-unveiled-1.681526 – The Victims, CBC News Online, 16 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was the deadliest act of air terrorism before 9/11, and the first bombing of a 747 Jumbo Jet which would set a pattern for future air terrorism plots. The crash occurred within an hour of the fatal [[1985 Narita International Airport bombing|Narita Airport Bombing]] which also originated from Canada without the passenger for the bag that exploded on the ground. Evidence from the explosions, witnesses and wiretaps of militants pointed to an attempt to actually blow up two airliners simultaneously by members of the [[Babbar Khalsa]] [[Khalistan movement]] militant group based in Canada to punish India for [[Operation Blue Star|attacking the Golden Temple]].

The [[Iranian Embassy siege]] took place in 1980, after a group of six armed men stormed the [[Embassy of Iran, London|Iranian embassy]] in [[South Kensington]], London. The government ordered the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), a [[special forces]] regiment of the British Army, to conduct an assault—Operation Nimrod—to rescue the remaining hostages. This response set the tone for how Western governments would respond to terrorism.

The [[Moscow theatre hostage crisis]] was the seizure of a crowded [[Moscow]] theatre on 23 October 2002 by some 40 to 50 armed [[Chechen people|Chechens]] who claimed allegiance to the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Islamist militant separatist movement in Chechnya]]. They took 850 hostages and demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from [[Chechnya]] and an end to the [[Second Chechen War]]. The siege was officially led by [[Movsar Barayev]]. After a two-and-a-half-day siege, Russian [[Spetsnaz]] forces pumped an [[Moscow hostage crisis chemical agent|unknown chemical agent]] (thought to be fentanyl, [[3-methylfentanyl]]), into the building's [[Mechanical ventilation|ventilation]] system and raided it.&lt;ref name="today"&gt;[http://www.russiatoday.ru/spotlight/release/830/video Modest Silin, Hostage, Nord-Ost siege, 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626022037/http://www.russiatoday.ru/spotlight/release/830/video |date=2008-06-26 }}, [[Russia Today]], 27 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, 39 of the attackers were killed by Russian forces, along with at least 129 and possibly many more of the hostages (including nine foreigners).

On September 1, 2004, in what became known as the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]], 32 Chechen separatists took 1,300 children and adults hostage at [[Beslan]]'s School Number One. When Russian authorities did not comply with the rebel demands that Russian forces withdraw from Chechnya, 20 adult male hostages were shot. After two days of stalled negotiations, Russian special forces stormed the building. In the ensuing melee, over 300 hostages died, along with 19 Russian servicemen and all but perhaps one of the rebels. Basayev is believed to have participated in organizing the attack.&lt;ref name="g"&gt;{{cite news | title=Shamil Basayev – Chechen politician seeking independence through terrorism | author=Jonathan Steele | publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] | work=Obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/chechnya/Story/0,,1817558,00.html |date=July 11, 2006 | accessdate= |quote=one-time guerrilla commander who turned into a mastermind of spectacular and brutal terrorist actions ... served for several months as prime minister | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=April 2009}}.

The [[2004 Madrid train bombings]] (also known in Spain as 11-M) were nearly simultaneous, coordinated bombings against the Cercanías commuter train system of Madrid, Spain, on the morning of 11 March 2004{{nsmdns}}three days before Spain's general elections and two and a half years after the September 11 attacks in the United States.

The [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] (often referred to as 7/7) were a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks in central London which targeted civilians using the public transport system during the morning rush hour. On the morning of Thursday, 7 July 2005, four Islamist extremists separately detonated three bombs in quick succession aboard London Underground trains across the city and, later, a fourth on a double-decker bus in Tavistock Square. Fifty-two civilians were killed and over 700 more were injured in the attacks. Later a dozen unexploded bombs were found in a car located in North London. 3 out of the 4 suspects were identified Mohammed Silique Khan, Germaine Morris Lindsay, Shahzad Tawnier where they are found to be in cohorts with Osama Bin Laden and eventually documents are leaked showing that Osama bin laden and Rashid Ruff planned the London bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/06/world/europe/july-7-2005-london-bombings-fast-facts/|title=July 7 2005 London Bombings Fast Facts|first=CNN|last=Library|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway in 2011 two sequential lone wolf terrorist attacks by right-wing extremist Anders Behring Breivik were carried out against the government, the civilian population, and a Workers' Youth League (AUF)-run summer camp in Norway on 22 July 2011. The attacks claimed a total of 77 lives. The first part of the attack was a van bomb in Oslo. The van was placed in front of the office block housing the office of Prime Minister and other government buildings. The explosion killed eight people and injured at least 209 people, twelve of them seriously. He followed this attack by impersonating a police officer to access the island on which the AUF summer camp was being held and proceeded to go on a shooting spree that killed 69 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/07/29/norway.attacks/|title=Norway honors victims of terrorist attacks|date=|work=cnn.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the British government branded the [[murder of Lee Rigby|killing of a serviceman]] in a [[Woolwich]] street, a terrorist attack. One of his attackers made political statements which were later broadcast with blood still on his hands from the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2013-05-22/exclusive-video-man-with-bloodied-hands-speaks-at-woolwich-scene/|title=Exclusive video: Man with bloodied hands speaks at Woolwich scene|date=|work=ITV News|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men responsible for the attack remained on the scene until incapacitated by armed police.

On 13 November, 28 hours after the [[2015 Beirut bombings|Beirut attack]], three groups of ISIS terrorists performed mass killings in various places in Paris' Xe and XIe arrondissements. They killed a total of more than 130 citizens. Hostages were taken in the concert hall "Le Bataclan" for three hours, and ninety were killed before the special police entered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11999723/Paris-terror-attacks-La-Belle-Equipe-survivor-so-traumatised-she-cant-speak.html] https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11999723/Paris-terror-attacks-La-Belle-Equipe-survivor-so-traumatised-she-cant-speak.html&lt;/ref&gt; The president immediately started the emergency threat procedure, for the first time on the entire French territory since the Algeria events in 1960.

On March 22, 2016 yet another terrorist attack happened within the confines of Europe. Three nail bombs went off at the same time in Belgium, two happened at Brussels Airport in Zaventem approximately 40 seconds apart. The other nail bomb was at Maalbeck metro station also in Brussels about an hour after the airport attacks The act was carried out by 3 suicide bombers, killing 31 people and injuring 300 people in the process. The three men were claimed as members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria known as ISIS.  The third nail bomb at the metro station failed to explode during the terrorist act that Tuesday and was safely deactivated. The two men who hit the Brussels Airport were brothers Ibrahim El Bakraoui and Khalid El Bakraoui while a third person was with them  Najim Laachraoui who was believed to be the bomb maker also died, the suspect who had the bomb at the metro station has not yet been identified. The Brothers were both killed during the explosions along with the bomb maker, while the unidentified terrorist fled for he had the bomb that did not explode in the metro station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/03/23/belgian-state-tv-names-brussels-attack-suspects/82153446/|title=One 35-pound bomb in Brussels attack failed to go off; suicide note found|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brussels responded to this attack with a level 4 alert the highest it had had since the Paris attacks mentioned above. World leaders responded by unifying and offering their aid along with sorrows for the tragedy that happened there on March 22, 2016. 28 heads of state in the European union agreed to fight the War on Terror to better and protect the Union.

The United States responded to the attacks by launching the [[War on Terror]]. Specifically, on October 7, 2001, it invaded Afghanistan to depose [[the Taliban]], which had harbored al-Qaeda terrorists. On October 26, 2001, the U.S. enacted the [[USA PATRIOT Act|Patriot Act]] that expanded the powers of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Many countries followed with similar legislation. Under the Obama administration, the U.S. changed tactics moving away from ground combat with large numbers of troops, to the use of drones and special forces. This campaign eliminated much of al-Qaeda's most senior members, including a strike by [[Seal Team Six]] that resulted in the death of Osama Bin Laden in 2011.

As the Islamic state of Syria and Iraq increases in size and power their attacks are affecting all parts of the world even in their own back yard of Turkey. Taking place in [[Istanbul]] a suicide bomber once again detonated a car bomb killing 4 people and injuring 31. No extremist group took responsibility for the attack but the attacker Mehmet Ozturk was linked to have ties with ISIS. This was just days after the car bomb attack in Turkeys capital of Ankara killing 37 people. The U.S. security council asked for the repeated terror attacks on Turkey to stop, and that the War on Terror will just become stronger due actions like these killing innocent people. Since the attacks Israel has requested that its citizens not travel to Turkey unless its necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/20/europe/turkey-blast/|title=Istanbul bomber had ISIS links, minister says|first=Gul Tuysuz, Faith Karimi and Greg Botelho,|last=CNN|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2016 a series of terrorist attacks took place in [[Jakarta, Indonesia]] resulting in 8 dead. The responsibility of these attacks were claimed by ISIS Counter terrorism has named this type of attack 'Marauding Terrorist Firearms Attack' because of the fast reaction needed by local policemen to stop the gunfire attack from the terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35309195,&lt;/ref&gt; The attack on Jakarta is linked to a bigger picture of terror in the Indonesian country for those of ISIS. Indonesia is home of the "largest regional terror groups" housing seven Islamist extremist groups. Leaving the thoughts that ISIS is trying to establish a satellite city in Indonesia, due to the fact that it has the largest Muslim population. Although ISIS branches have not yet reached the land of Southeast Asia in big masses, there is the fear that it is only a matter of time until Indonesias small extremist groups grow in masses once direct contact with ISIS is made. Once contact is established [[local terror groups]] will quickly mobilize to carry out the tasks that ISIS asks of them. ISIS will turn to Southeast Asia because it is only evident that they will lose control of the middle east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atimes.com/2016/01/jakarta-terror-attacks-will-parts-of-southeast-asia-become-isis-satellite-cities/|title=Jakarta terror attacks: Will parts of Southeast Asia become ISIS’ satellite cities?|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Land of Legends, ''Centre for Historical-Archaeological Research and Communication''''' (in Danish "Sagnlandet Lejre" and formerly known as Lejre Experimental Centre) is a 106-acre (43 hectare) [[archaeological open-air museum]] situated in the [[Lejre Municipality]], few kilometres west of [[Roskilde]] ([[Denmark]]). 

Land of Legends was founded in 1964 by ethnologist [[Hans-Ole Hansen]] and comprise reconstructions of an [[Nordic Iron Age|Iron Age]] village and sacrificial bog (200 BC to 200 AD), a [[Viking]] market place (900 AD), a [[Nordic Stone Age|Stone Age]] campsite (5000 BC), an 18th-century farmstead and various grave monuments. The historical artisan workshops (the pottery, the weaver's workshop, the smithy) work to reproduce (pre-)historical handicraft. Gardens, pastures and fields are the natural scenario of activities and reconstructions. At the Land of Legends Lejre, the activities for the public utilizes previous techniques, known from historical documents, archaeological evidence or [[experimental archaeology]].

Each summer many families spend a week of their holidays in the Iron Age village, the farm cottages and the Stone Age campsite. They dress in period costume and take on the role of peopling the reconstructed areas, while trying to live using the techniques of the past.

Many archaeologists from all over the world come to the Land of Legends to perform their [[Experimental archaeology|experiments]], dealing with a broad variety of subjects and artifacts. For example, the '''Land of Legends''' has several times supported the experimental work of [[Errett Callahan]], one of the world's most recognised [[flintknappers]].

Around 55,000 tourists and school children visit Lejre each year.

'''The Latino vote''' or the Hispanic vote refers to the voting trends during [[elections in the United States]] by eligible voters of [[Latino]] or Hispanic background. This phrase is usually mentioned by the media as a way to label voters of this ethnicity, and to opine that this demographic group could potentially tilt the outcome of an election, and how candidates have developed messaging strategies to this ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcvi.org/latino_voter_research/latino_voter_statistics.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://theamericano.com/2011/04/27/importance-latino-vote-future-elections/&lt;/ref&gt;


==Voting demographics==
A study by the Center for Immigration Studies projected that in November 2012 Hispanics would comprise 17.2 percent of the total U.S. population, 15 percent of adults, 11.2 percent of adult citizens, and 8.9 percent of actual voters. By comparison, the report found that in 2012, non-Hispanic whites are expected to be 73.4 percent of the national vote and non-Hispanic blacks are expected to be 12.2 percent. The report noted that by weight "eight percentage points of the Hispanic vote nationally equals slightly less than one percentage point of the non-Hispanic white vote." The study also found that the 8.9 percent Hispanic share of voters compares to veterans (12 percent of the electorate), those with family incomes above $100,000 (18 percent), seniors 65 and older (19 percent), married persons (60 percent), and those who live in owner-occupied housing (80 percent).&lt;ref name="Camarota and Zeigler"&gt;Steven A. Camarota and Karen Zeigler, "Projecting the 2012 Hispanic Vote," Center for Immigration Studies, August 2012. Available at: http://cis.org/projecting-2012-hispanic-vote-nationally-battleground-states&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of voter turnout, the [[Center for Immigration Studies]] projected that 52.7 percent (± 0.6) of eligible Hispanics will vote in the 2012 election, an increase from 49.9 percent in 2008 and a continuation of the past decade's long upward trend. The projected Hispanic voter participation rate of 52.7 percent compares to 66.1 percent for non-Hispanic whites and 65.2 percent for non-Hispanic blacks in 2008.&lt;ref name="Camarota and Zeigler"/&gt;

States with the most share of eligible Latino voters in 2016 were: New Mexico (40.4%), Texas (28.1%), California (28.0%), Arizona (21.5%), Florida (18.1%), Nevada (17.2%), Colorado (14.5%), and New York (13.8%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mapping the Latino Electorate by State |url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/interactives/mapping-the-latino-electorate-by-state/ |website=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 


==Low Voting Turnout==
The amount of Latinos who participate in political activities varies, but rarely exceeds half of adults. In general, Latinos participate in common civic activities, such as voting, at lower rates than non-Hispanic Whites or Blacks. Approximately 57.9 percent of U.S. citizen adult Latinos were registered to vote at the time of the 2004 election, and 47.2 percent turned out to vote&lt;ref name=DeSipio2006&gt;{{cite book |last1=DeSipio |first1=Louis |title=Latino Civic and Political Participation. In: National Research Council (US) Panel on Hispanics in the United States |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-309-10044-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The registration and turnout rates are approximately 10 percent lower than those of non-Hispanic blacks and 18 percent lower than those of non-Hispanic whites.

To explain low voter turnout among Latinos, researchers have analyzed voter participation demographics throughout many years. Researchers have found many explanations as towards why Latinos have a low voter turn out. There are explanations that account for physical barriers such as lack of transportation. As well as systemic barriers such as, harassment, discrimination, inadequate numbers of polling booths, inconvenient placements of polling booths, and biased administration of election laws may suppress Latino access to registering and voting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rosenstone |first1=Steven |last2=Hansen |first2=John Mark |title=Mobilization, Participation, and Democracy in America |date=2002 |isbn=978-0321121868}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

One of the biggest explanation for low Latino voter turn outs is associated with accurately measuring the Latino vote based on a general population that includes many non-citizens. The number of adult non-U.S. citizens rose from 1.9 million in 1976 to more than 8.4 million in 2000, a 350 percent increase&lt;ref name=DeSipio2006 /&gt;. Thus, the share of Latino nonparticipants are overwhelmingly non-U.S. citizens. 

Another explanation for low levels of Latino voter turnout stems from the relatively young age of the Latino population&lt;ref name=PantojaWoods&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pantoja |first1=Adrian |last2=Woods |first2=Nathan |title=Turning out the Latino Vote in Los Angeles County:, Did Interest Group Efforts Matter? |journal=American Review of Politics |date=1999 |volume=20 |page=141–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, 40 percent of the California Latino population was under eighteen years of age in 1985.

Individuals with lower incomes vote at lower rates than people with higher incomes. In terms of income, the general argument is that individuals with higher socioeconomic status have the civic skills, the participatory attitudes, and the time and money to facilitate participation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jackson |first1=Robert |title=Differential Influences on Latino Electoral Participation |journal=Political Behavior |date=2003 |volume=25 |issue=4 |page=339–366}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Education is also positively related to participation and vote choice, as Latinos with a college degree and postgraduate training are more likely to vote. More than 30 percent of Hispanic adult citizens have less than a high school education, while 12 percent of non-Hispanic white adult citizens have less than a high school education&lt;ref name=DeSipio2006 /&gt;. Therefore, low participation may result from low levels of knowledge about the political process that should be garnered through formal education.

Although turn out for Latinos is low, it has been noted that Latinos residing in communities with a large Latino population are more likely to turn out to vote &lt;ref name=PantojaWoods /&gt;.

==Latino Vote Influences==
There is a significant amount of literature dedicated to analyzing what influences Latino vote choices. One strong determinant has been found to be religion, which is believed to play a role in defining the political attitudes and behaviors of Latino voters. Latinos have long been associated with Catholicism with respect to faith and religious identity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maldonado |first1=David |title=Protestantes/Protestants : Hispanic Christianity within mainline traditions |date=1999 |isbn=978-0687055098 |page=9–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the Democratic Party with regard to political allegiance and identity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kelly |first1=Nathan |last2=Morgan |first2=Jana |title=Religion and Latino partisanship in the United States |journal=Political Research Quarterly |date=2005 |volume=58 |issue=1 |page=87 – 95}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although most Latinos affiliate themselves with the Democratic Party, the Latino National Political Survey, has found a consistent finding that Latinos identify themselves ideologically as moderates and conservatives. Social conservatism usually originates from religion, which often times predicts Latino’s opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage, support for the death penalty, and support for traditional gender roles. 

Political ads have also been studied to determine how they influence Latino voting behavior. In a study conducted by Abrajano, it was concluded that different political ads influence Latino vote choices depending on how assimilated individuals are to American life&lt;ref name=Arbajano2010 &gt;{{cite book |last1=Arbajano |first1=Marisa |title=Campaigning to the New American Electorate Advertising to Latino Voters |date=2010 |isbn=9780804774703 |page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For Spanish dominated Latinos, political ads that tapped into ethnic identity seemed to be the most influential. On the other hand, for assimilated Latinos, ethnic appeals did have some influence but exposure to more informative policy ads in English or Spanish had a greater impact on these voters decision to vote &lt;ref name=Arbajano2010 /&gt;.


==Policies==
In the United States, the Latino or Hispanic vote is typically associated with immigration issues such as immigration reform, immigration enforcement and amnesty for undocumented immigrants, usually with images of [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[illegal immigrants]] crossing the border or being arrested by the [[border guard|border patrol]], despite the fact that in many cases immigration could be an issue no more important than unemployment or the economy for many [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino American]] citizens.&lt;ref&gt;http://thehispanicblog.com/2012/03/12/is-respect-a-major-issue-for-latinos-election-2012-coverage-on-the-hispanic-vote/&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from both the 2002 and 1999 National Surveys on Latinos revealed that over 60% percent of Latinos favor a larger government with more government programs, even if this means higher taxes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coffin |first1=Malcolm |title=The Latino Vote: Shaping Americas Electoral Future |journal=The Political Quarterly |date=2003 |volume=74 |issue=2 |page=214–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Government programs that Latinos are more likely to advocate for are those that focus on issues such as crime control and drug prevention, child care services, environmental protection, science and technology, defense, and programs for refugees and immigrants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=De La Garza |first1=Rodolfo |last2=DeSipio |first2=Louis |last3=Garcia |first3=Chris |last4=Garcia |first4=John |last5=Falcon |first5=Angelo |title=Latino Voices: Mexican, Puerto Rican, And Cuban Perspectives On American Politics |date=1992 |isbn=978-0813387246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the National Exit Poll, in 2012 60% of Latino voters identified the economy as the most important issue the country was facing&lt;ref name=Pew2012&gt;{{cite web |title=Latino Voters in the 2012 Election |url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/11/07/latino-voters-in-the-2012-election/ |website=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Education is also a constant preoccupation among Latino voters. Latinos emphasize education, mentioning such issues as expanding the number of schools, reducing class sizes, and adding to the cultural sensitivity of teachers and curricula &lt;ref name=Pew2012 /&gt;. Other educational concerns expressed by Latinos include ensuring that children are able to advance to the next educational level. Following the economy and education, health care (18%), the federal budget deficit (11%) and foreign policy (6%), were other concerns among the Latino population&lt;ref name=Pew2012 /&gt;. 


==2016 Election==

'''''Man Eaters and Jungle Killers''''' is the second book of jungle tales and [[man-eaters]] written by [[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson]], first published in 1957 by  [[George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Kenneth|title=Maneaters and Jungle Killers|year=1957|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

'''Introduction'''

Anderson writes of the effect progressing civilization and industrialization is having on the natural world. He writes these stories not only to give pleasure to the adventurous, but to provide a record of what the great forests of India were once like.

'''The Marauder of Kempekarai'''

Anderson pursues a man-eating [[Bengal tiger|tiger]] in the Kempekarai area, un-sure that the tiger will accept cattle baits, Anderson tries to lure the tiger by using the noisy pulley on the village well. Failing to procure a shot, the next day he sits in a tree hide, only to be spotted by the man-eater and gashed by the tiger's claws through the hide chair.  In his next attempt Anderson constructs a hide using a large wagon cart wheel buried against some large boulders - creating a hide space in between to sit over a crude human dummy. The dummy first attracts the attention of a [[sloth bear]], and then the man-eater. The man-eater attacks Anderson from above, but flees after gun fire. A storm then breaks and Anderson is left fighting to get out of his built in hide before the flood waters come in.

'''Alam Bux and the Big Black Bear'''

A disgruntled sloth bear starts mauling humans in the Nagvara Hills region – attacking in the typical bear fashion by clawing the face apart – leaving most victims to die of their wounds. When the son of Anderson's friend, Alam Bux is fatally attacked by the bear – Anderson comes to his aid. During the course of the next few weeks Anderson follows up on further bear attacks, during one of which he badly hurts his ankle leaving himself barely able to walk. Four days later Anderson returns to a field where the bear had been sighted, and sits out under a large fruit tree to try to get a final shot at the animal.

'''The Mamandur Man-Eater'''

The story of a young, female man-eating tiger, which Anderson suggests gained the habit from the man-eating tiger previously documented in 'The Striped Terror of Chamala Valley' ('[[Nine Maneaters And One Rogue]]'). Anderson arrives in the area and upon finding the latest human kill by a railway line, lies down on the track and awaits the return of the tiger. Whilst waiting patiently he notices the victims severed head begins to move - eventually he discovers that a [[rhinoceros beetle]] is trying to roll away the head. His wait is then interrupted by the arrival of a train, the train staff are then horrified when they discover Anderson's reason for lying on the tracks. After further attempts to attract the tigress with bait, Anderson by chance ends up luring the tiger by imitating a [[mating call]].

'''The Crossed-Tusker of Gerhetti'''

A rogue [[Indian elephant|elephant]] with distinctive overlapping tusks plagues the Gerhetti area, killing a number of people. Anderson arrives and his first days are wasted in tracking the wrong elephant, before he finally finds the distinctive crossed tusks he's looking for.

'''The Sangam Panther'''

A man-eating [[Indian leopard|panther]] in the Sangam area proves a tricky foe for Anderson as it will not be lured by animal baits. To solve the issue Anderson uses himself as bait, waiting for the panther in the center of a cattle pen. After spending the night being eaten by cattle ticks, the following night he waits dangerously exposed for the panther by lying on the top of a metal roof.

'''The Ramapuram Tiger'''

Following an injury from a [[Gin trap]], a cattle lifter turns man-eating tiger in Ramapuram. On following the drag marks of one of the live baits taken in the night, Anderson comes across a tigress and small cubs and is surprised when she does not charge. Anderson finds another one of his baits has been killed, and when he approaches the kill to examine it he is surprised by the man-eater who is still by the bullock. The man-eater's charge is hindered by the bulk of the dead bullock, giving Anderson time to make his shot.

'''The Great Panther of Mudiyanoor'''

A friend of Anderson at the Moyar Valley Ranch is plagued by a local panther, and when it kills his Alsatian he writes to Anderson for his help. Anderson's son Donald takes over the writing of the story as he heads to Mudiyanoor in his place, taking with him a photographer friend. Whilst on the trail of the panther the animal charges them, Anderson's friend is luckily enough to get a photo of the panther in mid-charge, and luckier still that Donald was a fast and good enough shot to stop the panther from coming any further.

'''The Mauler of Rajnagara '''

A tiger in the Rajnagara region develops a peculiar habit of mauling humans, never using its teeth on its prey - only its claws to wound. 11 of its 33 maul victims later died from their wounds or from blood poisoning. Anderson arrives on the scene at the time of a fresh human kill, and in inadequate shoes starts to track the tiger through the jungle. Despite sitting up over putrid human remains under the hot daytime sun - Anderson fails in his attempts to shoot the mauler. This story later continues in 'The Maneater of Pegepalyam' ([[The Black Panther of Sivanipalli and Other Adventures of the Indian Jungle]]) and concludes in 'From Mauler to Maneater' ([[The Call of the Man Eater]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11928">'''Marcelle Lalou''' (1890–1967) was a 20th-century French Tibetologist. Her major contribution to [[Tibetology]] was the cataloging of the entire [[Paul Pelliot|Pelliot]] collection of Old Tibetan manuscripts from [[Dunhuang]] at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. In addition to her cataloging work, she wrote articles on various aspects of Old Tibet, and she published a Tibetan textbook. Some of her most notable students include [[Rolf A. Stein]] and [[J. W. de Jong]].

Lalou was born August 23, 1890 at [[Meudon]]-Bellevue between Paris and Versailles. She was interested in art from an early age, and she painted and drew for pleasure her whole life. Her studies began in Art History, and many of her early publications are devoted to Art-historical themes.

Lalou volunteered as a nurse in the first world war. She made her start in Buddhist Studies following the war, studying [[Sanskrit]] with [[Sylvain Lévi]] and Tibetan with [[Jacques Bacot]]. She finished her doctorate in 1927 at the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]], where she later taught from 1938 to 1963. She was the secretary and later manager for the ''Bibliographie Bouddhique'', and she was the chief editor of ''[[Journal Asiatique]]'' from 1950 to 1966. For her work, Lalou was dubbed a Knight of the [[Légion d'honneur]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4346">The '''Molière authorship question''' is a controversy started in 1919 when [[Pierre Louÿs]], in two articles titled "Corneille est-il l'auteur d'Amphitryon ?" ("Is Corneille the author of ''[[Amphitryon (Molière)|Amphitryon]]''?") and "Molière est un chef-d'œuvre de Corneille" ("Molière is a masterpiece by Corneille"), claimed that he had uncovered a literary hoax. According to him, [[Molière]] had not written his own plays and had had [[Pierre Corneille]] for a [[ghostwriter]]; or, more precisely, Molière was a proxy for Corneille, following a practice which Louÿs believed was common but which one in fact does not encounter in 17th Century literature except for pamphlets and some collections of scholarly jokes around the turn of the century.

Louÿs therefore wrote in line with two recent publications by [[Abel Lefranc]], a professor at the [[Collège de France]], who had contributed to discussion of the [[Shakespeare authorship question]] by publishing one by one in 1918 and 1919 the two volumes of a book titled ''Sous le masque de William Shakespeare : William Stanley, VIe comte de Derby'', propounding the [[Derbyite theory of Shakespeare authorship]]. Louÿs, who had himself, throughout his career, published a number of works under different pseudonyms&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Goujon, ''Pierre Louÿs'', Fayard, 2002, 872 p.&lt;/ref&gt;—he had even made his name by passing off his ''[[The Songs of Bilitis]]'' as an original collection of Greek poems translated by him—but had not in his vast correspondence suggested any possible link between Molière and Corneille,&lt;ref&gt;''Pierre Louÿs'' by Goujon, p. 745 and following&lt;/ref&gt; jumped at the chance to transpose onto Molière the doubt that some English-speaking authors (well before Abel Lefranc) had expressed about Shakespeare and to lend thus to Corneille the same taste for pseudonymity.

This contention, which attracted interest from time to time through the 20th Century after the splash made by Louÿs, has been renewed at the beginning of the 2000s, notably with the publication in a scientific journal of two articles attempting to use [[stylometry|stylometric analysis]] to show the closeness of vocabulary and syntax between Corneille and Molière; but, in both cases, the inquiry was not expanded to other authors of comedies in the 17th Century to verify whether the similarity between Corneille and Molière is any greater than with their other contemporaries. As in the case of Shakespeare, this theory is rejected by all experts on Corneille&lt;ref&gt;See for example the conclusion of André Le Gall in the most recent biography of Corneille (Flammarion, 1997): "Il n'est pas inconcevable que Molière ait confié ses manuscrits à Corneille afin qu'il y jette un œil. […] Cette hypothèse-là, purement hypothétique, mais conforme à la nature des liens qui peuvent se tisser entre un auteur et son metteur en scène, n'ôte en rien à Molière la paternité de ses œuvres" (p.473); see also, as of 2011, the objection published by the community of Corneille scholars: http://www.corneille.org/index.php?lng=fr&lt;/ref&gt; and Molière,&lt;ref&gt;See for example the conclusion of Roger Duchêne in the most recent biography of Molière (Fayard, 1998): "Devant ce tissu d'inventions, d'approximations et d'erreurs qui ne convainquent que ceux qui aiment le sensationnel et se laissent emporter par l'imagination et l'éloquence d'un auteur de romans, on reste confondu en voyant que l'idée continue de faire son chemin et à trouver des défenseurs au fil du temps." (p.162); see also, as of 2011, the site [http://www.moliere-corneille.paris-sorbonne.fr "Molière auteur des œuvres de Molière"] created by the editors of the new edition of Molière's ''Œuvres complètes'' in the [[Bibliothèque de la Pléiade]], published in 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as historians of literature and French drama generally, who do not even mention it.&lt;ref&gt;See the most recent history of French drama: Charles Mazouer, ''Le Théâtre français de l'âge classique'', Paris, Champion, 2 vol. (2006 et 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multiracial feminist theory''' is a feminist theory thought to have gained momentum in the 1970s by feminist [[women of color]].{{who|date=December 2016}} [[Maxine Baca Zinn]] and Bonnie Thornton Dill wrote ''“Theorizing Difference from Multiracial Feminism”'' in 1996, a piece emphasising intersectionality and the application of [[intersectional analysis]] in feminist discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Dill, Bonnie Thornton, and Maxine Baca Zinn. “Theorizing Difference from Multiracial Feminism.”''Feminist Studies'', vol. 22, no. 2, 1996, pp. 321, {{jstor|3178416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women of color{{who|date=December 2016}} have challenged the use of the second-wave movement as it places women's oppression at the root of sexism, without any regards to other forms of domination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Multiracial Feminism: Recasting the Chronology of Second Wave Feminism|publisher=Routledge|edition=3|location=New York|pages=56|last1=Thompson|first1=Becky|editor1-last=Kim|editor1-first=Seung-kyung|editor2-last=McCann|editor2-first=Carole}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, women of color acknowledge that race acted as a foundational power structure that heavily effected their lives. The activist work of WOC has been erased from the second wave movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The term, "multiracial" was used to illustrate the importance of race interacting with other forms of oppression to understand gender relations. With a focus on race, multiracial feminism acknowledges, "the social construction of differently situated social groups and their varying degrees of advantages and power".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Thornton-Dill|first2=Bonnie|date=1996|title=Theorzing Difference from Multiracial Feminism|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=22|issue=2|pages=321–331|last1=Baca Zinn|first1=Maxine}}&lt;/ref&gt; One definition of multiracial feminism is, "an attempt to go beyond a mere recognition of diversity and difference among women to examine structures of domination, specifically the importance of race in understanding the social construction of gender." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The central point of this perspective is to focus in on the significance of race, institutionalized racism, and struggles against racial oppression to understand how various forms of domination influence women's experiences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Overview ==
A product, in part, of [[Chicana feminism]],{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} multiracial feminist theory covers a wide range of gender-based, racial and political discourses intended to further analyze the interlocking oppressions minorities, women, women of color and other oppressions individuals face.

== History ==
Having first gained steam in the 1970s, [[multiracial feminism]] grew as a movement to challenge racist, classist, and sexist barriers not as separate, singular matters but as interlocking identities that make up both privilege and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, Carole R., and Seung-kyung Kim. Feminist Theory Reader: Local and Global Perspectives. 4th ed., Routledge, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiracial feminism is described as a “liberation movement spearheaded by women of color” and focused primarily on intersectional analysis and both an international and a multiracial approach to oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Doetsch-Kidder, Sharon. “Loving Criticism: A Spiritual Philosophy of Social Change.” ''Feminist Studies'', vol. 38, no. 2, 2012, pp. 444-473, {{jstor|23269194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not acknowledged by the second wave movement, women of color and white women took a stand to combat racism and colonialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Black feminists believed that, "cross-racial struggle made clear the work that white women needed to do in order for cross-racial sisterhood to really be powerful." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; White women also recognized that sexism was not the root of women's oppression.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} They collaborated to put forth an anti-rascist movement that incorporated interlocking forms of oppression.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

== Notable proponents ==
* Maxine Baca Zinn – born in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] on June 11, 1942, Maxine Baca Zinn is a sociologist known as being one of the “foremothers of multiracial feminism.”&lt;ref&gt;"Baca Zinn, Maxine: 1942 –: Sociologist.” ''Encyclopedia.com,'' http://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/baca-zinn-maxine-1942-sociologist. Accessed on 8 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Working alongside other feminist theorists like Bonnie Thornton Dill, [[Patricia Hill Collins]] and Lynn Weber, Baca Zinn’s hypotheses suggest a need for intersectional analysis regarding identities such as race and gender in contemporary feminism.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Bonnie Thornton Dill
* Becky Thompson
* [[Patricia Hill Collins]]

== Application ==
It is widely agreed by many if not most multiracial feminists that multiracial feminist theory is needed in order to broaden feminist discourse and bring much-needed intersectionality to contemporary feminist movements.{{clarify|It is widely acknowledged by proponents of X that X is needed|date=December 2016}} In spite of this, however, multiracial feminism struggles to gain momentum as an intersectional approach to combating oppression and is fairly new concept in the world of quantitative research. New though it may be, Catherine Harnios in her book, ''Feminist Measure in Survey Research,'' writes that multiracial feminism may be more beneficial to feminist discourse than once thought.&lt;ref&gt;Harnios, Catherine E. Feminist Measures in Survey Research. SAGE, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Family study, formation and power relations have been extensively examined using a multiracial feminist approach, the results of which reveal a hidden power dynamic between “advantaged families and disadvantaged families.”&lt;ref&gt;Townsend-Bell, Erica E. “Writing the Way to Feminism.” ''Signs'', vol. 38, no. 1, 2012, pp.127-152, {{jstor|10.1086/665806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advantaged families have been shown to rely upon the labor and disadvantage of poorer families, women, women of color, minorities and immigrants.

Women of color provide an "outsider within" perspective as they are active participants in domination while also continue to be oppressed by it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In understanding multiracial feminism, it is important to note how interlocking forms of oppression persist to marginalize groups of people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although people continue to be oppressed, others are privileged at the sacrifice of those who don't obtain benefits of the system. [[Patricia Hill Collins]] defines the term, [[Matrix of domination|Matrix of Domination]], to refer to how various forms of oppression work different depending on what social location one obtains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In reference to this term, people will have varying experiences with gender, class, race, &amp; sexuality, depending on what social position one has in relation to structural powers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In terms of interlocking oppressions, this results in different social groups experiencing varying subordination and privilege.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Activism ==
Though women of color are rarely credited as being prevalent in the 2nd Wave feminist movement, it has become evident that multiracial feminism was very much present in the 1980s through the 1990s and even today.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In the 1970s, women of color worked alongside hegemonic, white feminist groups but found it to be mostly centered on the white, middleclass feminist issues of the time. With the help of white, anti-racist women, women of color gave rise to multiracial feminist theory and led to the development of organizations created by and for women of color.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Becky. “Multiracial Feminism: Recasting the Chronology of Second Wave Feminism.” ''Feminist Studies'', vol. 28, no. 2, 2002, pp. 337 {{jstor|3178747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiracial feminists of the 1980s challenged white feminism by speaking out of the individual experiences of women of color, immigrants, and “third-world women” who had been largely swept under the rug.&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, Maxine Baca. “Feminism and Family Studies for a New Century.” ''The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,'' vol. 571, 2000, pp. 42-56, {{jstor|1049133}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was mostly done through multiracial feminist writings which have been revealed to date as far back as the 1960s.

=== Online activism ===
There has been a notable increase of multiracial feminists, journalists and bloggers using online media to write about and theorize on intersectionality and multiracial experience as it relates to class, gender and race cooperatively in contemporary society.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Journalist for ''msmagazine.com'', Janell Hobson, wrote a critique of white feminist activism pointing out the fact that women of color are still being left out of the conversation in current feminist discourse. She claims that it is time feminists “reclaim solidarity” by recognizing race and gender as being intertwined, rather than separate matters to be deal with individually.&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, Janell. “Black Women, White Women and the Solidarity Question.” ''MS. Magazine Blog,'' 27 Nov. 2013, &lt;http://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/11/27/black-women-white-women-and-the-solidarity-question&gt; Accessed on 8 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Lara Witt who writes for ''Rewire.news'', calls upon both her privilege and oppression to understand her role as a multiracial feminist with the ability to speak out against racism towards Black, Hispanic, and Indian people.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Lara. “As a Multiracial Woman, This is Why I Need Intersectional Feminism.” ''Rewire,'' 2 Sept. 2016, &lt;http://rewire.news/article/2016/09/02/multiracial-woman-need-intersectional-feminism&gt; Accessed on 8 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==
In April 1996, there was a rally in [[Middletown, Connecticut]] led by a multiracial coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Blee, Kathleen M., and France W. Twine. ''Feminism and Antiracism: International Struggles for Justice.'' New York University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking place at [[Wesleyan University]], the rally was organized in defense of journalist and author [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]] who had been placed on death row in Pennsylvania.

== Criticism ==
Some criticisms have been raised challenging whether or not multiracial feminist theory can actually produce measurable results due to a lack of “existing survey tools” by which to quantify or examine those experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Ifatunji, Mosi, and Harnios, Catherine E. “Gendered Measures, Gendered Models: Toward an Intersectional Analysis of Interpersonal Racial Discrimination.” ''Ethnic &amp; Racial Studies'', vol.34, no. 6, 2011, pp.1006-1028 {{doi|10.1080/01419870.2010.516836}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear as to whether or not these criticisms will be the undoing of multiracial feminist theory or if such drawbacks can be overcome with more time and research.

A '''pantomime dame''' is a traditional role in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[pantomime]]. It is a continuation of ''[[travesti (theatre)|travesti]]'' portrayal of female characters by male actors in [[drag (clothing)|drag]]. They are often played either in an extremely [[Camp (style)|camp]] style, or else by men acting '[[Butch and femme|butch]]' in women's clothing. They wear big make up and [[big hair]], have exaggerated physical features, and perform in a [[melodramatic]] style. While not from pantomime, possibly the best known of this type of character is [[Dame Edna Everage]] whose name plays on two meanings of ''dame'': this tradition and the title equivalent to ''[[Sir]]''.

==Dame characters==
Characters who are played as pantomime dames are often - though not exclusively - older, matronly women. Indeed, they may be the protagonist's mother, as in ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' and ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', or a [[nursemaid]] to the protagonist, as in ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[Snow White]]''. Although often warm and sympathetic characters, dames may also be employed as comic antagonists, such as with the [[Ugly sisters|Ugly Sisters]] in ''[[Cinderella]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pantomime Dames|url=http://www.its-behind-you.com/pantodames.html|website=ITS BEHIND YOU DOT COM|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pantomimes traditionally do not contain standard dame roles, but certain productions may add a dame character, as in the case with many pantomime versions of ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Pan|url=http://www.its-behind-you.com/storypeterpan.html|website=ITS BEHIND YOU DOT COM|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples of these characters include:
*[[Widow Twankey]], the traditional name for [[Aladdin|Aladdin's]] mother in the pantomime versions of the story
*[[Mother Goose]]
*The nanny or nurse in ''[[Babes in the Woods]]'' 
*The cook in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''
*The queen in ''[[Puss in Boots]]''
*Goldilocks' mother in ''[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]'', who runs a circus in many versions of the pantomime&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goldilocks and the Three Bears|url=http://www.its-behind-you.com/storygoldilocks.html|website=ITS BEHIND YOU DOT COM|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Photoplay''''' was one of the first American [[film]] [[fan magazine]]s. It was founded in 1911 in [[Chicago]], the same year that [[J. Stuart Blackton]] founded ''[[Motion Picture Magazine|Motion Picture Story]],'' a magazine also directed at fans. For most of its run, ''Photoplay'' was published by [[Macfadden Publications]]. In 1921 ''Photoplay'' established what is considered the first significant annual movie award. The magazine ceased publication in 1980.

==History==
''Photoplay'' began as a short-fiction magazine concerned mostly with the plots and characters of films at the time and was used as a promotional tool for those films. In 1915, Julian Johnson and [[James R. Quirk]] became the editors (though Quirk had been vice president of the magazine since its inception), and together they created a format which would set a precedent for almost all celebrity magazines that followed. By 1918 the circulation exceeded 200,000, with the popularity of the magazine fueled by the public's increasing interest in the private lives of celebrities.

''Photoplay'' reached its apex in the 1920s and 1930s and was considered quite influential within the motion picture industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Pamela Hutchinson |title=Photoplay magazine: the birth of celebrity culture |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/jan/26/photoplay-magazine-hollywood-film-studios-stars-celebrity-culture |accessdate=2018-09-13 |work=The Guardian |date=January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was renowned for its artwork portraits of film stars on the cover by such artists as Earl Christy and Charles Sheldon. Macfadden Publications purchased the magazine in 1934. With the advancement of color photography, the magazine began using photographs of the stars instead by 1937.

''Photoplay'' published the writings of [[Hedda Hopper]], [[Walter Winchell]], [[Hazel MacDonald]], [[Adela Rogers St. Johns]], [[Sheilah Graham]], [[Dorothy Kilgallen]], [[Rob Wagner]], later editor and publisher of [[Rob Wagner's Script]], and [[Louella Parsons]], among others. The magazine was edited by Quirk until 1932; later editors include Kathyrn Dougherty, Ruth Waterbury, and Adele Whiteley Fletcher. It also featured the health and beauty advice of [[Sylvia of Hollywood]], arguably the first fitness guru to the stars.

[[Sidney Skolsky]], a nationally syndicated [[gossip columnist]] for the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' and later the ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' had a regular column in ''Photoplay'' called "From A Stool At Schwab’s", the [[Schwab's Pharmacy|Hollywood drugstore]] he made famous, such was the magazine's popularity.&lt;ref name="Sidney Skolsky"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sidney Skolsky|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9034|publisher=Find a Grave|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lana Turner at Schwab's"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkerson|first=W.R. 3rd|title=Writing the End to a True-to-Life Cinderella Story : Remembrance: The facts of Lana Turner's discovery at a soda fountain have changed through the years, but the legend remains.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-01/entertainment/ca-19119_1_lana-turner|accessdate=24 September 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Photoplay Magazine Medal==
[[File:Photoplay-Medal.jpg|thumb|Front of the first Photoplay Magazine Medal of Honor, created in gold by [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]] and presented in 1921 to [[Cosmopolitan Productions]] for the film ''[[Humoresque (1920 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1920)]]
In 1921 ''Photoplay'' established what is considered the first significant annual movie award, the Photoplay Magazine Medal of Honor.&lt;ref name="Photoplay Awards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Photoplay Awards|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000537/overview|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An actual medallion produced by [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]], it was voted on by the readers of the magazine and given to the producer of the year's best film, chosen with an emphasis on (according to Quirk) "the ideals and motives governing its production... the worth of its dramatic message." Though ''Photoplay'' only gave the single award for best film, its intentions and standards were influential on the [[Academy Awards]] founded later in the decade, and they overlap on [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] choices to some extent, though increasingly in the 1930s ''Photoplay'''s choices reflected its primarily female audience. By 1939 the Medal of Honor had declined in importance and the award was discontinued that year.

From 1944 to 1968, ''Photoplay'' awarded a Gold Medal for film of the year based on polling done by [[George Gallup]]'s Audience Research Inc. through the 1950s, and then voted on by the magazine's readers. It also awarded Most Popular Male Star and Most Popular Female Star based on an actor and actress' popularity, not their performance. The awards were based on polling through the 1950s, and then on a vote by the readers, similar to the Gold Medal.&lt;ref name="Photoplay Awards" /&gt; [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Greer Garson]] were frequently named the most popular film stars during the 1940s and later winners of the title included [[James Stewart]], [[Jane Wyman]], [[Alan Ladd]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Kim Novak]]. Most popular television stars were also named in the 1960s. In 1948, the ''Photoplay Awards'' were broadcast on network television as part of ''[[The Steve Allen Show|The Steve Allen Plymouth Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Steve Allen Plymouth Show|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0864188/combined|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merger==
''Photoplay'' merged with another fan magazine, ''Movie Mirror'', in 1941; and with ''TV-Radio Mirror'' in 1977, when the name became ''Photoplay and TV Mirror''. The magazine ceased publication in 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hDG6auRCJ4C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=Photoplay|title=Inside the Hollywood Fan Magazine: A History of Star Makers, Fabricators, and Gossip Mongers|first=Anthony|last=Slide|date=26 February 2010|publisher=Univ.

Callahan, president of Macfadden, which he had acquired five years earlier, said that the decision to cease publication was made “very reluctantly."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its staff was moved to ''[[Us Weekly|Us]]'' magazine.

A British version of ''Photoplay'' debuted in 1950, featuring an equal mix of American and British films and stars, and ceased publication in 1989.

'''Sangay National Park''' ({{lang-es|Parque Nacional Sangay}}) is a [[national park]] located in the [[Morona Santiago]], [[Chimborazo Province|Chimborazo]] and [[Tungurahua Province|Tungurahua]] provinces of [[Ecuador]]. The park contains two active [[volcano]]es ([[Tungurahua]] and [[Sangay]]), one extinct volcano [[El Altar]] (Kapak Urku), and [[ecosystem]]s ranging from [[tropical]] [[rainforest]]s to [[glacier]]s.

The park has been listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 1983. In 1992, it was added to the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] due to illegal [[poaching]], extensive [[grazing]], unplanned road construction and encroachment of the park's perimeter. It was removed from the UNESCO list of endangered sites in 2005.

==Fauna==
The National Park is an important refuge for rare species of the [[Andes]], like [[mountain tapir]] and [[spectacled bear]]. Especially for the mountain tapir, the park is one of the most important strongholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Downer, CC. |year=1996 |title=The mountain tapir, endangered 'flagship' species of the high Andes |journal=Oryx |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=45–58 |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=3872384&amp;q=sangay+national+park+tapir&amp;uid=788425701&amp;setcookie=yes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127132320/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=3872384&amp;q=sangay+national+park+tapir&amp;uid=788425701&amp;setcookie=yes |archivedate=2011-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the forests below live spectacled bears, [[giant otter]], [[South American jaguar|jaguar]], [[ocelot]], [[margay]], [[Brazilian tapir]], [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus ustus''), [[Little Red Brocket|little red brocket deer]] and [[Northern pudu]]. About 300-400 bird species inhabit the Park.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP &amp; WCMC: ''SANGAY NATIONAL PARK ECUADOR'', (letztes update 2005) [http://sea.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/pdf/Sangay.pdf PDF]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South American cougar|cougar]] and [[pampas cat]] have been recorded in the park as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nowell, K.; Jackson, P. |year=1996 |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |location=Gland, Switzerland |publisher=IUCN |url=http://carnivoractionplans1.free.fr/wildcats.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a new ''[[Pristimantis]]'' species was described from the park's [[cloud forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brito M, J., Ojala-Barbour, R., Batallas R, D. and Almendáriz C, A. |year=2016 |title=A New Species of ''Pristimantis'' (Amphibia: Strabomantidae) from the Cloud Forest of Sangay National Park, Ecuador |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=337–344 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1670/13-103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stockton''' is a [[census-designated place]] (CDP) in [[Worcester County, Maryland|Worcester County]], [[Maryland]], United States. The population was 143 at the 2000 census. It is part of the [[Salisbury metropolitan area|Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
Stockton, originally called '''Sandy Hill''', grew up at the crossing of the [[post road]] from [[Snow Hill, Maryland|Snow Hill]] south to [[Virginia]] (whose track is generally followed by modern [[Maryland Route 12]]) with the road from Mattapony Landing on the [[Pocomoke River]] to the [[Chincoteague Bay]] (the eastern part of which is now [[Maryland Route 366]]), where small ocean-going vessels could drop anchor.  The landing on Chincoteague Bay came to be known as George Island Landing.  Settlement in the area began in the 1660s, when the area was still part of [[Somerset County, Maryland|Somerset County]].  [[Worcester County, Maryland|Worcester County]] was separated from Somerset in 1742, and by 1774 Sandy Hill had grown large enough to merit a [[chapel of ease]] within All Hallows' Parish, today called Holy Cross Chapel.  Sandy Hill, unlike neighboring [[Girdletree, Maryland|Girdletree]], was never [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]], but in 1870 the&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings and Acts of the General Assembly, 1870
Volume 188, Page 3149, 610 LAWS OF MARYLAND, CHAPTER 349.&lt;/ref&gt; name of the town was officially changed, by act of the legislature, from Sandy Hill to Stockton, commemorating the Rev. [[Thomas H. Stockton]], a prominent Methodist minister.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitworcester.org/index.php/site/article/ea-vaughn-kayak-trail Renamed for Thomas H. Stockton&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872 the Worcester County [[election district]] which took its name from Sandy Hill was renamed Stockton.

In 1876, a railroad (which would eventually become part of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]) was laid from [[Franklin City, Virginia|Franklin City]] and [[Greenbackville, Virginia|Greenbackville]] in Virginia to Snow Hill.  The line's main purpose was to haul [[seafood]] harvested from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and Chincoteague Bay to [[Philadelphia]], but the line also carried passengers.  To avoid confusion with other Stocktons around the country, the station at Stockton was named '''Hursley Station'''.

The center of Stockton was destroyed by fire in 1906, but was soon rebuilt, with many of the new buildings constructed of brick. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Stockton boasted a hotel, five churches, a post office, three stores, a [[canning]] factory, two [[sawmill]]s, and two [[barrel]] factories. However, the [[overfishing]] of Chincoteague Bay led to a permanent decline in the commercial seafood industry.

A new Stockton High School was dedicated in 1926. Grades 7th to 11th were discontinued in 1942, but grades 1st to 6th continued until 1960, when the school was closed.  Stockton's only bank failed in 1929. [[Passenger trains]] ended service in the late 1940s, and the last [[freight train]] made its final run through Stockton in approximately 1955. Holy Cross Chapel stopped holding regular services in 1943. Gunby Presbyterian Church holds only one service per month. The Stockton Poultry Plant opened as [[World War II]] ended, but closed around 1970.  Today, Stockton residents are as likely to work at [[NASA]]'s [[Wallops Flight Facility|Wallops Island Flight Facility]] on the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]] than to be [[farmers]] or [[Fishing industry|watermen]]. The post office was closed in 2012, and no business of any kind is now in operation.

==Geography==
Stockton is located at {{coord|38|3|26|N|75|25|0|W|type:city}} (38.057233, &amp;minus;75.416661).&lt;ref name="GR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|1.7|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.

[[Maryland Route 12]] and [[Maryland Route 366]] cross in the center of Stockton.

Approximately two miles east of Stockton is an extensive network of manmade canals.&lt;ref&gt;https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Stockton,+MD&amp;sll=38.04701,-75.367928&amp;sspn=0.13924,0.43499&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Stockton,+Worcester,+Maryland&amp;ll=38.052805,-75.36516&amp;spn=0.009124,0.019011&amp;z=16 Map view of canal network&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Stockton,+MD&amp;sll=38.04701,-75.367928&amp;sspn=0.13924,0.43499&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Stockton,+Worcester,+Maryland&amp;ll=38.040901,-75.365471&amp;spn=0.002281,0.004753&amp;t=h&amp;z=18 Satellite view of canal network&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]&lt;ref name="GR2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov |archivedate=September 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of 2000, there were 143 people, 49 households, and 39 families residing in the CDP. The [[population density]] was 82.8 people per square mile (31.9/km²). There were 55 housing units at an average density of 31.8/sq&amp;nbsp;mi (12.3/km²). The racial makeup of the CDP was 37.06% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 60.84% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 1.40% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], and 0.70% from two or more races.

There were 49 households out of which 28.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 51.0% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 26.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.4% were non-families. 16.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.92 and the average family size was 3.23.

In the CDP, the population was spread out with 25.9% under the age of 18, 10.5% from 18 to 24, 25.9% from 25 to 44, 21.7% from 45 to 64, and 16.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 66.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 68.3 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $14,583, and the median income for a family was $25,833. Males had a median income of $13,750 versus $0 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the CDP was $5,776. There were 42.3% of families and 45.0% of the population living below the [[poverty line]], including 63.8% of under eighteens and none of those over 64.

The '''Text Encoding Initiative''' ('''TEI''') is a [[written language|text-centric]] [[community of practice]] in the [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] of [[digital humanities]], operating continuously since the 1980s. The community currently runs a mailing list, meetings and conference series, and maintains an [[eponymous]] [[technical standard]], a [[Scientific journal|journal]], a [[wiki]], a [[GitHub]] repository and a [[toolchain]].

==TEI guidelines==

The ''TEI Guidelines'', which collectively define an XML format, are the defining output of the community of practice. The format differs from other well-known [[open formats]] for text (such as [[HTML]] and [[OpenDocument]]) in that it's primarily semantic rather than presentational; the semantics and interpretation of every tag and attribute are specified.
Some 500 different textual components and concepts
(&lt;tt&gt;word&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-w.html|title=Element w (word)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;sentence&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-s.html|title=Element s (s-unit)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;character&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-c.html|title=Element c (character)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;glyph&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-g.html|title=Element g (character or glyph)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;person&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-person.html|title=Element person (person)  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
etc.); each is grounded in one or more academic discipline and examples are given.

===Technical details===

The standard is split into two parts, a discursive textual description with extended examples and discussion and set of tag-by-tag definitions. Schemata in most of the modern formats ([[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[RELAX NG]] and [[W3C Schema]]) are generated automatically from the tag-by-tag definitions. A number of tools support the production of the guidelines and the application of the guidelines to specific projects.

A number of special tags are used to circumvent restrictions imposed by the underlying [[Unicode]]; &lt;tt&gt;glyph&lt;/tt&gt; to allow representation of characters that don't qualify for Unicode inclusion&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; to allow overcome the required strict linearity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-choice.html|title=Element choice  - TEI P5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most users of the format do not use the complete range of tags but produce a customisation, using a project-specific subset of the tags and attributes defined by the Guidelines. The TEI defines a sophisticated customization mechanism known as ODD for this purpose. In addition to documenting and describing each TEI tag, an ODD specification specifies its content model and other usage constraints, which may be expressed using [[schematron]].

''TEI Lite'' is an  example of such a customization. It defines an [[XML]]-based [[file format]] for exchanging texts.  It is a manageable selection from the extensive set of elements available in the full TEI Guidelines.

===Examples===

The text of the TEI guidelines is rich in examples. There is also a samples page on the TEI wiki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Samples_of_TEI_texts |title=Samples of TEI texts |work=wiki.tei-c.org |year=2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives examples of real-world projects which expose their underlying TEI.

====Prose tags====

TEI allows texts to be marked up syntactically at any level of granularity, or mixture of granularities. For example, this paragraph (p) has been marked up into sentences (s) and clauses (cl).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html#AILCW |title=17 Simple Analytic Mechanisms - TEI P5: — Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="XML"&gt;

 &lt;s&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;It was about the beginning of September, 1664,
  &lt;cl&gt;that I, among the rest of my neighbours,
       heard in ordinary discourse
   &lt;cl&gt;that the plague was returned again to Holland; &lt;/cl&gt;
   &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;for it had been very violent there, and particularly at
     Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;whither, &lt;cl&gt;they say,&lt;/cl&gt; it was brought,
  &lt;cl&gt;some said&lt;/cl&gt; from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods
  &lt;cl&gt;which were brought home by their Turkey fleet;&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;others said it was brought from Candia;
     others from Cyprus. &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;It mattered not &lt;cl&gt;from whence it came;&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;cl&gt;but all agreed &lt;cl&gt;it was come into Holland again.&lt;/cl&gt;
  &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/s&gt;

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Verse====

TEI has tags for marking up verse. This example (taken from the French translation of the TEI Guidelines) shows a sonnet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/fr/html/ref-lg |title=TEI element lg (groupe de vers) |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;div type="sonnet"&gt;
 &lt;lg type="quatrain"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Les amoureux fervents et les savants austères&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Aiment également, dans leur mûre saison,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Les chats puissants et doux, orgueil de la maison,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Qui comme eux sont frileux et comme eux sédentaires.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="quatrain"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Amis de la science et de la volupté&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Ils cherchent le silence et l'horreur des ténèbres ;&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; L'Érèbe les eût pris pour ses coursiers funèbres,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; S'ils pouvaient au servage incliner leur fierté.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="tercet"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Ils prennent en songeant les nobles attitudes&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Des grands sphinx allongés au fond des solitudes,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Qui semblent s'endormir dans un rêve sans fin ;&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type="tercet"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Leurs reins féconds sont pleins d'étincelles magiques,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt; Et des parcelles d'or, ainsi qu'un sable fin,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Étoilent vaguement leurs prunelles mystiques.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Choice tag====

The &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; tag is used to represent sections of text which might be encoded or tagged in more than one possible way. In the following example, based on one in the standard, &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; is used twice, once to indicate an original and a corrected year and once to indicate an original and regularised spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-choice.html |title=TEI element &lt;tt&gt;choice&lt;/tt&gt; |work=tei-c.org |year=2012 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="XML"&gt;
&lt;p xml:id="p23"&gt;Lastly, That, upon his solemn oath to observe all the above
articles, the said man-mountain shall have a daily allowance of
meat and drink sufficient for the support of &lt;choice&gt;
  &lt;sic&gt;1724&lt;/sic&gt;
  &lt;corr&gt;1728&lt;/corr&gt;
 &lt;/choice&gt; of our subjects,
with free access to our royal person, and other marks of our
&lt;choice&gt;
  &lt;orig&gt;favour&lt;/orig&gt;
  &lt;reg&gt;favor&lt;/reg&gt;
 &lt;/choice&gt;.

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==ODD==

'''One Document Does it all''' ("ODD") is a [[literate programming]] language for [[XML schema]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2004|last1=Bauman|first1=Syd|last2=Flanders|first2=Julia|contribution=ODD customizations|title=Extreme Markup Languages 2004|url=http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2004/Bauman01/EML2004Bauman01.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2004|last1=Burnard|first1=Lou|author2-link=Sebastian Rahtz|last2=Rahtz|first2=Sebastian|contribution=RelaxNG with Son of ODD|title=Extreme Markup Languages 2004|url=http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2004/Burnard01/EML2004Burnard01.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Literate Documentation for XML|last=Reiss|first=Kevin M.|publisher=Digital Humanities 2007|location=Urbana-Champaign, Illinois|year=2007|url=http://dhcommons.tamu.edu/sites/default/files/poster_208_reiss.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A complete schema definition language for the Text Encoding Initiative|first1=Lou|last1=Burnard|author2-link=Sebastian Rahtz|first2=Sebastian|last2=Rahtz|date=June 2013|journal=XML London 2013|doi=10.14337/XMLLondon13.Rahtz01|url=http://xmllondon.com/2013/presentations/rahtz/|pages=152–161|isbn=978-0-9926471-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In literate-programming style, ODD documents combine human-readable documentation and machine-readable models using the  Documentation Elements module of the Text Encoding Initiative. Tools generate [[Internationalization and localization|localised and internationalised]] [[HTML]], [[ePub]], or [[PDF]] human-readable output and [[Document Type Definition|DTD]]s, [[XML Schema (W3C)|W3C XML Schema]], [[RELAX NG|Relax NG]] Compact Syntax, or Relax NG XML Syntax machine-readable output.

The Roma web application&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/ Roma web application].&lt;/ref&gt; is built around the ODD format and can use it to  generate schemas in [[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[XML Schema (W3C)|W3C XML Schema]], [[RELAX NG|Relax NG]] Compact Syntax, or Relax NG XML Syntax formats, as used by many XML validation tools and services.

ODD is the format used internally by the Text Encoding Initiative for their [[eponymous]] [[Technical Standards and Safety Authority|technical standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|year=2007|editor1-first=Lou|editor1-last=Burnard|editor2-first=Syd|editor2-last=Bauman|title=TEI P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange|publisher=TEI Consortium|location=Charlottesville, Virginia, USA|url=http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ODD files generally describe the difference between a customized XML format and the full TEI model, ODD also can be used to describe XML formats that are entirely separate from the TEI.  One example of this is the [[W3C| W3C's]] [[Internationalization Tag Set]] which uses the ODD format to generate schemas and document its vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/its/ W3C ITS] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/its/itstagset.xml TEI ODD file].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Best Practices for XML Internationalization|editor1-last=Savourel|editor1-first=Yves|editor2-last=Kosek|editor2-first=Jirka|editor3-last=Ishida|editor3-first=Richard|publisher=W3C Working Group|year=2008|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-i18n-bp/|contribution=5.2 ITS and TEI}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==TEI customizations==

TEI customizations are specializations of the TEI XML specification for use in particular fields or by specific communities.

* [[EpiDoc]] (Epigraphic Documents)
* [http://www.cei.lmu.de/ Charters Encoding Initiative]
* [http://www.menota.org/ Medieval Nordic Text Archive (Menota)]

Customization in the TEI is done through the ODD mechanism mentioned above. In truth since its P5 version, all so-called 'TEI Conformant' uses of the TEI Guidelines are based on a TEI customization documented in a TEI ODD file. Even when users choose one of the off-the-shelf pre-generated schemas to validate against, these have been created from freely available customization files.

==Projects==
The format is used by many projects worldwide. Practically all projects are associated with one or more universities. Some well-known projects that encode texts using TEI include:

==History==
Prior to the creation of TEI, humanities scholars had no common standards for encoding electronic texts in a manner which would serve their academic goals ([[Susan Hockey|Hockey]] 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;41).  In 1987, a group of scholars representing fields in humanities, linguistics, and computing convened at Vassar College to put forth a set of guidelines known as the “Poughkeepsie Principles”. These guidelines directed the development of the first TEI standard, "P1"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahronheim|first=J.R.|title=Descriptive metadata: Emerging standards.|journal=Journal of Academic Librarianship|year=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantara |first=L.|title=The text-encoding initiative: Part 1|journal=OCLC Systems &amp; Services|year=2005|volume=21|issue=1|pages=36–39|doi=10.1108/10650750510578136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1987''' Work on what would become the TEI started by  the  [[Association for Computers and the Humanities]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ach.org/ ach.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]], and the [[Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing]].&lt;ref&gt;"Historical background", [http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AB.html#ABTEI section iv.2] of TEI P5:  Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange.&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the ''Closing statement of the Vassar Planning Conference''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/SC/teipcp1.txt |title= Closing statement of the Vassar Planning Conference |work=tei-c.org |year=2009 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  '''1994''' TEI P3 released&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/|title=TEI Guidelines|accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  co-edited by  Lou Burnard (at [[Oxford University]]) and [[Michael Sperberg-McQueen]] (then at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], later at the [[W3C]]).
* '''1999''' TEI P3 updated.
* '''2002''' TEI P4 released, moving from SGML to XML; adoption of [[Unicode]], which XML parsers are required to support.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=XML Basics|chapter=2|url=http://www.xmlnews.org/docs/xml-basics.html |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2007''' TEI P5 released, including integration with the &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xml:id&lt;/code&gt; attributes from the W3C&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/|title=Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)|work=w3.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (these had previously been attributes in the TEI namespace), regularization of local pointing attributes to use the hash (as used in HTML) and unification of the ptr and xptr tags.

'''''The Longest Day''''' is a book by [[Cornelius Ryan]] published in 1959, telling the story of [[D-Day]], the [[Normandy landings|first day]] of the [[World War II]] [[invasion of Normandy]]. It includes details of [[Operation Deadstick]], the ''[[coup de main]]'' operation by [[Military glider|gliderborne troops]] to capture both [[Pegasus Bridge]] and [[Horsa Bridge]] before the main assault on the Normandy beaches.  It sold tens of millions of copies in eighteen different languages.&lt;ref name="cjr"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cjr.org/second_read/the_reporter_who_time_forgot.php?page=all | title= The Reporter Who Time Forgot | publisher=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] | date= May–June 2010 | author= Michael Shapiro| accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is not a dry military history, but rather a story about people, and reads at times like a novel. It is based on interviews with a cross-section of participants, including U.S., Canadian, British, French and German officers and civilians.

The book begins and ends in the village of [[La Roche-Guyon]]. The book refers to the village as being the most occupied village in occupied France and states that for each of the 543 inhabitants of [[La Roche-Guyon]] there were more than 3 German soldiers in the village and surrounding area. Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] commander-in-chief of Army Group B had his headquarters in the castle of the village which was the seat of the [[Duc de La Rochefoucauld]].

Ryan's book is divided into three parts: the first part is titled The Wait, the second part is named The Night and the third part is named The Day. The book includes a section on the casualties of D-Day and also lists the contributors including their service details on the day of the invasion and their occupations at the time the book was first published.

Researchers spent almost three years locating survivors of D-Day and over 3000 interviews were undertaken in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, France and Germany. 383 accounts of D Day were used in the text of the book.

Senior Allied officers who assisted the author included General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]], Lieutenant General [[James M. Gavin]], Lieutenant General Sir [[Frederick E. Morgan]] and General Sir [[Richard Nelson Gale]]. German officers who assisted with the book included Generaloberst [[Franz Halder]], Hauptmann [[Hellmuth Lang]] and General der Infanterie [[Günther Blumentritt]]. The author also used Allied and German post action reports, War diaries, histories and official records.

On 6 June 1965, the author published an article "More of The Longest Day" in ''Reader's Digest'' as a supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelius Ryan dedicated his book for all the men of D-Day.

The book takes its name from a comment made by [[Erwin Rommel]] to his aide Hauptmann Helmuth Lang on 22 April 1944: "...the first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive...the fate of Germany depends on the outcome...for the Allies, as well as Germany, it will be the longest day."

''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' is also the name of a 1962 film based on the book, featuring many star actors.

The '''Trace Erasure Principle''' is a stipulation proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] as part of the [[Generative grammar|Generative-Transformational Grammar]]. Under the Trace Erasure Principle, traces of an [[noun phrase]] (NP) can be replaced only by a designated morpheme and not by an arbitrary NP.

The following is an example of this Principle:

:''A person is here, waiting for you.''

can be transformed into:

:''There is a person here, waiting for you.''

and this Principle remains fulfilled.

Both sentences hold the same meaning, because we have designated ''There'' to replace ''a person'' —both terms are mutually linked—, and the meaning remains.

A case where this principle is not fulfilled can be the following:

:''Maria loves Mario.''

transformed into:

:''Mario loves Maria.''

Obviously, the meaning of the latter is radically different from that of the first. We have replaced ''Mario'' with ''Maria'', and their meaning is not linked. We have arbitrarily chosen ''Mario'' to replace ''Maria''.

But the following phrase fulfills the Principle:

:''Maria, who loves Mario.''

In this case, ''who'' identifies with ''Maria''.

==Biography==
Varvara Stepanova who was born in [[Kaunas]] (in modern-day [[Lithuania]]) came from peasant origins but was able to get an education at [[Kazan Art School]], [[Kazan]]. There she met her later husband and collaborator [[Alexander Rodchenko]]. In the years before the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] they leased an apartment in Moscow, owned by [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. These artists became some of the main figures in the [[Russian avant-garde]]. The new [[abstract art]] in Russia which began around 1915&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A3710&amp;page_number=1&amp;template_id=6&amp;sort_order=1&amp;section_id=T053505#skipToContent Kazimir Malevitch, ''Life and painted work, Before 1918'', Troels Andersen, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; was a culmination of influences from [[Cubism]], Italian [[futurism (art)|Futurism]] and traditional peasant art. She designed [[Cubo-futurism|Cubo-Futurist]] work for several artists' books, and studied under [[Jean Metzinger]] at [[Académie de La Palette]], an art academy where the painters [[André Dunoyer de Segonzac]] and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] also taught.&lt;ref&gt;Examiner, ''Constructivism &amp; early avant-garde Russian fashion design'', November 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following the revolution, Stepanova involved herself in [[Poetry|poetry,]] [[philosophy]], [[painting]], [[Graphic arts|graphic art]], [[Theatrical scenery|stage scenery]] construction, and textile and [[Fashion design|clothing designs]]. She contributed work to the Fifth State Exhibition and the Tenth State Exhibition, both in 1919. 

In 1920 it came to a division between painters like [[Kasimir Malevich]] who continued to paint with the idea that art was a spiritual activity, and those who believed that they must work directly for the revolutionary development of the society. In 1921, together with [[Aleksei Gan]], Rodchenko and Stepanova formed the first ''Working Group of Constructivists'', which rejected fine art in favor of graphic design, photography, posters, and political propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;"Rodchenko, Alexander." by Yvonne Jones in ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art''. Oxford Art Online. [[Oxford University Press]]. Accessed 10 May 2013, http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t118/e2252.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1921, Stepanova declared in her text for the exhibition ''[[5x5=25]]'', held in Moscow:

:'''Composition is the contemplative approach of the artist. Technique and Industry have confronted art with the problem of construction as an active process and not reflective. The 'sanctity' of a work as a single entity is destroyed. The museum which was the treasury of art is now transformed into an archive'.''
The term '[[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]]' was by then being used by the artists themselves to describe the direction their work was taking. The theatre was another area where artists were able to communicate new artistic and social ideas. Stepanova designed the sets for ''The Death of Tarelkin'' in 1922.

==Clothing designs==
In 1921, Stepanova moved almost exclusively into the realm of production, in which she felt her designs could achieve their broadest impact in aiding the development of the Soviet society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavrentiev|first=Alexander|title=Amazons of the avant-garde : Alexandra Exter, Natalia Goncharova, Liubov Popova, Olga Rozanova, Varvara Stepanova, and Nadezhda Udaltsova|year=2000|publisher=Guggenheim Museum|location=New York|isbn=0810969246|page=241|authorlink=Varvara Stepanova|editor=John E. Bowlt and Matthew Drutt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian Constructivist clothing represented the destabilization of the oppressive, elite aesthetics of the past and, instead, reflected utilitarian functionality and production. Gender and class distinctions gave way to functional, geometric clothing. In line with this objective, Stepanova sought to free the body in her designs, emphasizing clothing’s functional rather than decorative qualities. Stepanova deeply believed clothing must be looked at in action. Unlike the aristocratic clothing that she felt sacrificed physical freedom for aesthetics, Stepanova dedicated herself to designing clothing for particular fields and occupational settings in such a way that the object’s construction evinced its function. In addition, she sought to develop expedient means of clothing production through simple designs and strategic, economic use of fabrics.&lt;ref name="Lodder 148"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lodder|first=Christina|title=Russian constructivism|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven [Conn.]|isbn=0300034067|page=148|edition=4. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Stepanova, thus, identified clothing as occupying two groups: ''prodezodezhda'' and ''sportodezhda''. Within these categories, she attended to logical, efficient production and construction of the garments.&lt;ref name="Adaskina 1987 149"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adaskina|first=Natalia|title=Constructivist Fabrics and Dress Design|journal=The Journal of Propaganda Arts|year=1987|volume=5|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, war-induced poverty placed economic restrictions on the Russian Constructivists’ industrial fervor, and their direct engagement with production was never fully realized. Thus, most of her designs were not mass-produced and circulated. 
&lt;ref name="Lodder 145"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lodder|first=Christina|title=Russian constructivism|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven [Conn.]|isbn=0300034067|page=145|edition=4. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first, ''prodezodezhda'', or production/working clothing in basic styles, included theater costumes as well as professional and industrial garments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lodder|first=Christina|title=Russian constructivism|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven [Conn.]|isbn=0300034067|edition=4. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1920s, Stepanova entered the clothing industry through her costume designs in theater, in which she translated her artistic affinity for geometric shapes into functional, emblematic clothing. Made of dark blue and grey material, the graphic costumes allowed actors to maximize the appearance of their movements, exaggerating them for the stage and transforming the body into a dynamic composition of geometric shapes and lines.&lt;ref name="Lavrentiev 1988 79"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavrentiev|first=Alexander|title=Varvara Stepanova, the complete work|year=1988|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0262620820|page=79|edition=1st MIT Press|editor=John E. Bowlt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this category, Stepanova began designing ''spetsodezhda'', or clothing specialized for a specific occupation.&lt;ref name="Adaskina 1987 149"/&gt; In doing so, she designed clothing for men and women in both industrial and professional capacities with meticulous consideration of seaming, pockets, and buttons to ensure each aspect of the costume maintained a functional intention. Regardless of the occupational context, her working clothing carried a distinctive geometric and linear edge, rendering the body into a graphic composition and boxy, androgynous form.&lt;ref name="Lavrentiev 1988 79"/&gt;

The second category, ''sportodezhda'', or sports costumes, also presented bold lines, large forms, and contrasting colors to enable and emphasize the body’s movements and allow spectators to easily distinguish one team from the other. Stepanova even rendered the team’s emblem into a graphic design.&lt;ref name="Lavrentiev 1988 79"/&gt; The sports arena offered a context for Stepanova to realize an idealized bodily neutralization, and her uniforms were often unisex with pants and a belted tunic that obscured the human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kiaer|first=Christina|title=Imagine no possessions : the socialist objects of Russian constructivism|year=2008|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0262612216|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textiles==
Stepanova carried out her ideal of engaging with industrial production in the following year when she, with [[Lyubov Popova]], became [[designer]] of textiles at the Tsindel (the First State Textile Factory) near Moscow, and in 1924 became professor of textile design at the [[Vkhutemas]] (Higher Technical Artistic Studios) while continuing [[typography]], book design and contributing to the magazine [[LEF (journal)|LEF]]. As a constructivist, Stepanova not only transposed bold graphic designs onto her fabrics, but also focused heavily on their production. Stepanova only worked a little over a year at The First Textile Printing Factory, but she designed more than 150 fabric designs in 1924. Although she was inspired to develop new types of fabric, the current technology restricted her to printed patterns on monotone surfaces. By her own artistic choice, she also limited her color palette to one or two dyes. Although she only used triangles, circles, squares, and lines, Stepanova superimposed these geometric forms onto one another to create a dynamic, multi-dimensional design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lavrentiev|first=Alexander|title=Varvara Stepanova, the complete work|year=1988|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0262620820|page=80|edition=1st MIT Press|editor=John E. Bowlt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribute==
On October 22, 2018,{{refn|group="note"|name=Date of Birth}} Stepanova was honoured with a [[Google Doodle]] posthumously on her 124th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|URL=https://www.google.com/doodles/varvara-stepanovas-124th-birthday|publisher=Google|date=October 22, 2018|title=Varvara Stepanova’s 124th Birthday|accessdate=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''White Beech: The Rainforest Years''''' is a book describing efforts of regeneration of rainforest written by [[Germaine Greer]]. It was first published in 2013 by [[Bloomsbury]] and reprinted several times.

==Experiment==
Germine Greer was a successful writer by 2001 when she decided to invest all her earnings to purchase 60 hectares of over used land for a price of 268,000 pounds in the midst of rainforest in [[Queensland]], Australia.&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; It was a part of [[Gondwana Rainforests|Gondwana forest]] which was logged during 19th century and converted as a banana farm during 20th century. She left the place to itself so that the rainforest would regenerate and by 2013 her experiment is successful where a part of the overused land regenerated as rainforest.&lt;ref name="bloom"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greer |first1=Germine| title=White Beech : the Rainforest Years| date=2013| publisher=Bloomsburry|location=Great Britain|isbn=9781408846735|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YWrCAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain '''William Francis Lynch''' (1 April 1801 &amp;ndash; 17 October 1865), was a naval officer who served first in the [[United States Navy]] and later in the [[Confederate States Navy]].

==Personal life==

William F. Lynch was born in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt; On 2 June 1828, one month after his promotion to [[lieutenant (naval)|lieutenant]], Lynch was married in New Haven, Connecticut, to Virginia Shaw, the youngest daughter of a [[John Shaw (naval officer)|senior navy officer]] and sister-in-law of [[Francis Gregory|another]]. They had two children, but separated in the 1840s and divorced in 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jampoler |first1=Andrew |title=Sailors in the Holy Land: The 1848 American expedition to the Dead Sea and teh Search for Sodom and Gomorrah |date=2005 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, MD |pages=xiv-xvi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHptAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=sailors+in+the+holy+land&amp;dq=sailors+in+the+holy+land&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVrMHExavcAhWtnOAKHaqQANsQ6AEIKTAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Navy service==
He was appointed a [[midshipman]] 26 January 1819, and first saw service in [[USS Congress (1799)|USS ''Congress'']] and next in U.S. [[schooner]] [[USS Shark (1821)|''Shark'']] under Lieutenant [[Matthew C. Perry]]. Subsequent service included duty with Commodore [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]]'s "Mosquito Squadron" in the [[West Indies]] and in the [[Mediterranean]].

==Middle East Operations==
Lynch had his first command, the [[USS Poinsett (1840)|''Poinsett'']], from 3 March to 30 December 1839. The ship sailed on behalf of the United States Naval Hydrographic Office.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt; In 1847, he proceeded to the [[Jordan River]], transporting overland, by camels, a copper and a galvanized iron boat.&lt;ref name="CCL"&gt;Clark, Carol Lea. "Clash of Eagles: America's Forgotten Mission to Ottoman Palestine. Lyon's Press, 2012. Page 228. {{ISBN|978-0762778423}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 16 men were a part of the trip, including [[John Y. Mason]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/148/ |title=Map of the River Jordan and Dead Sea: And the Route of the Party Under the Command of Lieutenant W.F. Lynch, United States Navy |website=[[World Digital Library]] |date=1849–1852 |accessdate=2013-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each boat was "assembled" and then placed on a carriage. His expedition ended with the exploration of the [[River Jordan]] and the [[Dead Sea]].&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;

Using the triangulation method, Lynch's expedition was the first to determine that the Dead Sea was below sea level, something that the scientific community had inferred but not previously determined conclusively, though several other expeditions by Europeans had attempted to do so.  The American expedition's measurement showed the Dead Sea to be 1312.7&amp;nbsp;ft. (400 metres) below sea level.&lt;ref name="CCL"/&gt;

He published his travels in 1849, ''Narrative of the United States' Expedition to the River Jordan and the Dead Sea''.

In 1849 he was commissioned commander and in 1850 was promoted to captain. In 1852, he requested permission to explore the interior of Africa for purposes of possible colonization. In his exploration in west central Africa, he caught a fever, and was forced to return to the United States. Lynch believed that explorers who "remove the obstruction to Commerce, Civilization and Christianity will become the benefactors of mankind."&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;

==American Civil War==
After [[Virginia]] seceded from the [[United States]] on 17 April 17, 1861, he resigned from the United States Navy on 21 April. Lynch was initially appointed captain in the [[Virginia Navy]] and when Virginia joined the [[Confederate States of America]] and merged its military, he became a captain in the [[Confederate States Navy]] on 10 June 1861. He commanded naval batteries at [[Battle of Aquia Creek|Aquia Creek, Virginia]], during their shelling by Union gunboats in May 1861; was in charge of gunboats and the defense of [[Battle of Roanoke Island|Roanoke Island, North Carolina]] in February 1862; and led Confederate naval forces at [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]] from March to October 1862. He was also assigned to the [[Confederate States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] offices as the Chief of the Bureau of Orders and Details during 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/USN/Navy/Officers%20in%20the%20Confederate%20States%20navy,%201861-65.pdf |title= Officers in the Confederate States Navy, 1861-1865|author= Office of Naval War Records, Navy Department |date= 1898|website= ibiblio.org |publisher= Government Printing Office|access-date= 26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in command of ships in [[North Carolina]] waters, he commanded southern naval forces during the Union attack on [[Fort Fisher]], in December 1864 and January 1865.

==Post-war retirement==
After the defeat of the Confederacy, he was paroled 3 May 1865 in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. He died in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], on 17 October of the same year.&lt;ref name="CCL"/&gt;

==Namesake==
The [[USS Lynch (T-AGOR-7)]] was named after Lynch.

'''Xaltocan''' was a [[pre-Columbian]] [[city-state]] and island in the [[Valley of Mexico]], located in the center of [[Lake Xaltocan]], part of an interconnected shallow lake system which included [[Lake Texcoco]], this place is inside the [[San Miguel Jaltocan]], in Nextlapan. The site was originally settled by the [[Otomi people]], but following a war in the late fourteenth century where the Otomi were defeated by an alliance of [[Tepanec]]s and [[Aztec|Mexica]] the Otomi were driven off the island and relocated to [[Otompan|Otumba]], Metztitlan and [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]]. The island of Xaltocan was then resettled by [[Nahuatl]] speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 1980 p. 233-34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morehart 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The name can mean either of two things in the [[Nahuatl language]]: either 'sandy ground of [[spider]]s' or 'where [[sand]] sowing'.&lt;ref name="xal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/tlaxcala/mpios/29040a.htm |title=Archive copy of Tlaxcala - Xaltocan |accessdate=28 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306005947/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/tlaxcala/mpios/29040a.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Xaltocan is known to have been inhabited in the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Postclassic]] period. Ceramics and other archaeological remains dating to this period have been recovered in excavations at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Brumfiel, E (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to have been a local center of power capable of exacting tribute from other city-states in the area.

The founding of Xaltocan is described in the mytho-historical documents, the ''[[Historia Tolteca-Chichimeca]]'' and ''[[Anales de Cuauhtitlan]]''. According to the ''Anales'' the Xaltocameca (people of Xaltocan) were among the [[Chichimec]] tribes that left the mythical place of origin, [[Aztlán]], under a leader named ''Quauhtliztac'' ("White Eagle"). The ''Historia'' also identifies the Xaltocameca as belong to the Otomi ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 1980 p. 91-93&lt;/ref&gt; In this document, written by [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl|Ixtlilxochitl]], the first leader of the Xaltocameca is named as ''Iztacquauhtli'', which also means "White Eagle" in [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]].

In the 13th century Xaltocan were involved in a prolonged war with the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] city-state of [[Cuautitlán|Cuauhtitlan]]. Xaltocan was initially the strongest but around 1395 the ruler of Cuauhtitlan, Xaltemoctzin, allied himself with [[Tezozomoc (Azcapotzalco)|Tezozomoc]] of [[Azcapotzalco]] and his subjects the [[Mexica]] of [[Tenochtitlan]] and finally managed to conquer Xaltocan. The Otomi inhabitants fled north to the Otomian city-state of Metztitlan and to [[Tlaxcala]], while others were allowed to resettle on the lands of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] in the place that was henceforth called [[Otompan|Otumba]] - "Place of the Otomies".

During the next 100 years the site was resettled by Nahua peoples. After the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]] defeated the Tepanecs of Azcapotzalco, Xaltocan became an Aztec subject city and paid tribute to Tenochtitlan, mainly in the form of woven blankets.

In 1521 during the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]] the army of [[Hernán Cortés]] razed Xaltocan and burned it to the ground.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|326}}

'''Xochimilco''' was the most important city of the [[Xochimilca people]], one of the Nahua tribes that migrated to the [[Mesoamerica]] region. The city was founded around 900 AD. It grew to become an important city in the [[Valley of Mexico]], until in 1430, the Mexica of [[Tenochtitlan]] succeeded in conquering the city.

==Etymology==

[[File:Glifo Xochimilco.svg|thumb|left|Xochimilco's Aztec glyph]]

The name “Xochimilco” comes from [[Nahuatl]] and means “flower field.” This referred to the many flowers and other crops that were grown here on [[chinampa]]s since the pre-Hispanic period.

==History==

[[File:Cuahilama petroglifo2.JPG|thumb|250px|Petroglyph at Cuauhilama]]

The first human presence in the area was of hunter gatherers, who eventually settled into farming communities. The first settlements in the Xochimilco area were associated with the [[Cuicuilco]], [[Copilco]] and [[Tlatilco]] settlements during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic period]]. The [[Nahua peoples|Xochimilca people]], considered to be one of the seven Nahua tribes that migrated into the [[Valley of Mexico]], first settled around 900 CD in [[Cuahilama]], near what is now Santa Cruz Acalpixca. They worshipped sixteen deities, with [[Chantico]], goddess of the hearth and [[Cihuacoatl]], an earth goddess and [[Amimitl]], god of chinampas the most important.

The Xochimilcas were farmers and founded their first dominion under a leader named Acatonallo. He is credited for inventing the chinampa system of agriculture in order to increase production. These chinampas eventually became the main producer with crops such as corn, beans, [[chili pepper]]s, squash and more. The [[Xochimilco (altepetl)|city of Xochimilco]] was founded in 919. Over time, it grew and began to dominate other areas on the south side of the lakes such as [[Mixquic]], [[Tláhuac]], [[Culhuacán (altepetl)|Culhuacan]] and even parts of what is now the [[Morelos|State of Morelos]]. Xochimilco had one woman ruler, which did not happen anywhere else in [[Mesoamerica]] in the pre-Hispanic period. She is credited with adding a number of distinctive dishes to the area’s cuisine, with inclusions such as [[atole|necuatolli]], chileatolli ([[atole]] with chili pepper), [[esquites]] and [[tlapiques]].

In 1352, then emperor Caxtoltzin moved the city from the mainland to the island of Tlilan. In this respect it was like another island city in the area, [[Tenochtitlan]]. Although no longer an island, the city center is still in the same spot.  In 1376, Tenochtitlan attacked Xochimilco, forcing the city to appeal to [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]] for help. The conquest was unsuccessful, but Xochimilco was then forced to pay tribute to Azcapotzalco. Tenochtitlan succeeded in conquering Xochimilco in 1430, while it was ruled by Tzalpoyotzin. Shortly thereafter, Aztec emperor [[Itzcoatl]] built the [[causeway]] or calzada that would connect the two cities over the lake. During the reign of [[Moctezuma Ilhuicamina]], the Xochimilcas contributed materials and manpower to construct a temple to [[Huitzilopochtli]]. They also participated in the further conquests of the [[Aztec Empire]] such as in [[Cuernavaca|Cuauhnáhuac (Cuernavaca)]], [[Xalisco]] and the [[Metztitlán]] and [[Valley of Oaxaca|Oaxaca valleys]]. For their service, [[Ahuizotl]], granted the Xochimilcas autonomy in their lands, and the two cities coexisted peacefully. Aztec emperors would pass by here on royal barges on their way to [[Chalco (altépetl)|Chalco/Xico]], then an island in [[Lake Chalco]].

Aztec emperor [[Moctezuma Xocoyotzin]] imposed a new governor, Omácatl, onto Xochimilco due to the arrival of the Spanish, but this governor was forced to return to [[Tenochtitlan]], when the emperor was taken prisoner.  He was then succeeded by Macuilxochitecuhtli, but eighty days later he too went to Tenochtitlan to fight the Spanish alongside [[Cuitláhuac]]. He was followed by Apochquiyautzin, who remained loyal to Tenochtitlan.

For this reason, [[Hernán Cortés]] decided to send armies to subdue Xochimilco before taking Tenochtitlan. This occurred in 1521. During the battle, Cortés was almost killed when he fell off his horse, but he was saved by a soldier named Cristóbal de Olea.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|340–345}}

The battle was fierce and left few Xochimilca warriors alive. According to legend, it was after this battle that [[Cuauhtémoc]] came to Xochimilco and planted a juniper tree in the San Juan neighborhood to commemorate the event.

Pre-Hispanic Xochimilco was an island connected to the mainland by three causeways. One of these still exists in the form of Avenida Guadalupe I.Ramirez, one of the city’s main streets. This causeway led to the main ceremonial center of the town, which was called the Quilaztli. The Spanish destroyed the Quilaztli during the Conquest, and replaced it with the [[San Bernardino de Siena Church, Xochimilco|San Bernardino de Siena Church]], which would become the social and political center of the colonial city. It became a settlement of Spanish, [[Criollo people|criollo]]s and [[mestizo]]s, with the indigenous living in rural communities outside of the city proper.

After the Conquest, Apochquiyauhtzin, the last lord of Xochimilco, was baptized with the name of Luís Cortés Cerón de Alvarado in 1522 and he was allowed to continue governing under the Spanish. Evangelization was undertaken here by [[Martín de Valencia]] with a number of others who are known as the [[Twelve Apostles of Mexico|first twelve Franciscans in Mexico]]. Their monastery was built between 1534 and 1579, along with many chapels and churches in the Xochimilco area, a hospital in Tlacoapa and a school. Xochimilco was made an [[encomienda]] of [[Pedro de Alvarado]] in 1521 and remained such until 1541.
