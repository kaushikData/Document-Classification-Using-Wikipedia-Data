'''William George "Billy" Bunter''' is a fictional schoolboy created by [[Charles Hamilton (writer)|Charles Hamilton]] using the pen name Frank Richards. He features in stories set at [[Greyfriars School]], originally published in the boys' weekly story paper ''[[The Magnet|The&amp;nbsp;Magnet]]'' from 1908 to 1940. Subsequently, Bunter has appeared in novels, on television, in stage plays, and in comic strips.

He is in the Lower Fourth [[form (education)|form]] of Greyfriars School, known as the [[Remove (education)|Remove]], whose members are 14–15 years of age. Originally a minor character, his role was expanded over the years with his antics being heavily used in the stories to provide comic relief and to drive forward the plots.

Bunter's defining characteristic is his greediness and dramatically overweight appearance.  His character is, in many respects, a highly obnoxious [[anti-hero]]. As well as his gluttony, he is also obtuse, lazy, racist, inquisitive, deceitful, slothful, self-important and conceited.  These defects, however, are not recognised by Bunter.  In his own mind, he is an exemplary character: handsome, talented and aristocratic; and he dismisses most of those around him as "beasts". Even so, the negative sides of Bunter are offset by several genuine redeeming features; such as his tendency, from time to time, to display courage in aid of others; his ability to be generous, on the rare occasions when he has food or cash; and above all his very real love and concern for his mother. All these, combined with Bunter's cheery optimism, his comically transparent untruthfulness and inept attempts to conceal his antics from his schoolmasters and schoolfellows, combine to make a character that succeeds in being highly entertaining but which rarely attracts the reader's lasting sympathy.

== Origins ==
Charles Hamilton invented the character for an unpublished story in the late 1890s. He claimed Bunter was derived from three persons: a corpulent editor, a short-sighted relative, and another relative who was perpetually trying to raise a loan.

The identity of the fat editor is unclear: various sources suggest either Lewis Ross Higgins, editor of a number of comic papers and who is described as resembling the author [[G. K. Chesterton]]; or Percy Griffith, the original editor of ''The Magnet''.&lt;ref&gt;Lofts &amp; Adley, P.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Wright, P.65&lt;/ref&gt; The short sighted relative was Hamilton's younger sister Una, who had suffered poor sight since childhood, and who had been wont to ''peer at him somewhat like an Owl''; while the other relative was his older brother Alex, who was described as ''"generally anxious to borrow a pound or two"'' on the strength of the anticipated arrival of a cheque that never materialised.&lt;ref&gt;Lofts &amp; Adley, P47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnet stories==
Billy Bunter appeared in 1,670 of the 1,683 issues of ''The Magnet'' published during the 32-year period from 1908 to 1940.  He was introduced in Magnet No. 1 ''The Making of Harry Wharton'' (1908) as a minor character, but developed into one of the principal characters of the stories as author Charles Hamilton realised his comic potential.

[[George Orwell]] described him as "...a real creation. His tight trousers against which boots and canes are constantly thudding, his astuteness in search of food, his postal order which never turns up, have made him famous wherever the [[Union Flag|Union Jack]] waves." {{ Harvcol |Orwell|1940}}

In addition to stories set at Greyfriars School, his adventures also included many travel series, with trips to China, [[India]], [[Egypt]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], [[Brazil]], Hollywood and the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]].

===Appearance===
[[Image:Billy Bunter100.jpg|right|thumb|The original Bunter and Dicky Nugent from Page 3 of Magnet No. 100. 8 January 1910]]
In his first appearance, Billy Bunter was introduced thus:

{{quote|
''"The newcomer was a somewhat stout junior, with a broad, pleasant face and an enormous pair of spectacles."''
}}

Bunter's big round spectacles and rolling gait earned him the nickname the "''Owl of the Remove''".

In the early stories, both Bunter and classmate Johnny Bull were described as "stout" in appearance; and it was Magnet illustrator [[C. H. Chapman]] who first put Bunter into checked-pattern trousers to distinguish the two characters. With the passage of time, the illustrations would show Bunter's circumference as ever more pronounced, while Johnny Bull would become indistinguishable from the other schoolboys.&lt;ref&gt;Lofts &amp; Adley, P.101&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of the members of the Remove (Lower Fourth) form was published in Magnet #1659 ''Billy Bunter's Bargain'' (1939), and provided the boys' ages, heights, and weights. Billy Bunter's age is given as 15 years 1 month; his height as 4&amp;nbsp;ft 9ins; and his weight as 14 stone 12 1/2&amp;nbsp;lb.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friardale.co.uk/Magnet/1939/Magnet%201659-A.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Character===
On many levels, Bunter's character is deeply unattractive. He is the living embodiment of several of the [[seven deadly sins]]: pride, envy, avarice, sloth and, most especially, greed and gluttony.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friarsclub.net/Articles/attraction.htm{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Added to these, Bunter is also inquisitive, deceitful and obtuse. However these traits are softened by Bunter's cheery optimism, his comically transparent untruthfulness and his reliable ineptitude when attempting to conceal his antics from his schoolfellows and schoolmasters.

From the very first Magnet story, Bunter suffers an ongoing shortage of cash and is forever attempting to borrow money from his schoolfellows, explaining that he is expecting a [[postal order]] from one of his "titled relations". Over the course of stories spanning several decades, Bunter's celebrated postal order almost never materialises; and the subject becomes a long-running cause of hilarity in the Greyfriars Remove.  Even so, Bunter is a skilful and persistent borrower and succeeds in extracting countless loans from his schoolfellows.  Wealthier schoolboys such as Lord Mauleverer frequently part with a few shillings to be rid of Bunter; but even the notoriously tight-fisted American junior Fisher T Fish was persuaded to loan Bunter cash on at least one occasion.

Bunter's morals are peculiarly his own. He has every intention of repaying the cash he borrows, but allows such debts to linger for months and even years. He is obsessed with food – the sweeter and stickier, the better – and is utterly unscrupulous in helping himself to his schoolfellows' sweets, cakes and hampers, for which he earns countless kickings. But despite his complete lack of morals in such matters, Bunter is otherwise as honest as any other Greyfriars schoolboy.  He would never dream of deliberately stealing money or valuables.

In the early stories, Bunter was associated with his stammering stock phrase: ''"I'm s-sincerely sorry"''. As his character developed, the stammering would disappear; and the stock phrase would be replaced by the greeting ''"I say, you fellows!”'', the reproachful ''“Oh really, Wharton!”'' (or whichever character he is addressing), the anguished exclamation ''“Yaroooh!”'' and the distinctive giggle ''“He, he, he!”'' &lt;ref&gt;Lofts &amp; Adley, P.88&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bunter has a keen sense of his own self-importance, this is rarely shared by anyone else at Greyfriars. A notable exception occurs in a 1932 story, when an election for a new Remove Form Captain takes place. The support of the form divides equally between two candidates, leaving Bunter with the casting vote. His support is keenly solicited by supporters of both camps, and Bunter becomes the centre of attention – a position he exploits to the full.  In a conversation with his study mate Peter Todd, Bunter's view of the two candidates offers an insight into his priorities in life:

{{quote|
''""I'm thinking it out, Toddy," he answered, without moving.  "Can't say I like either of the beasts much!  Of course, in some ways, Smithy would make a better Form captain than Cherry."&lt;br&gt;
''"How do you make that out, fathead—I mean, old fellow!"&lt;br&gt;
''"Well, Skinner thinks that if Smithy gets in, a man will be able to dodge games practice without being reported to Wingate."&lt;br&gt;
''"Oh crumbs!"&lt;br&gt;
''That consideration, evidently, had a strong appeal for Bunter!&lt;br&gt;
''"Still, Cherry's not a bad chap in some ways!" said the fat Owl.  "He's a good deal more civil than Smithy, if a fellow drops into his study to tea."&lt;br&gt;
''"Oh!" gasped Toddy.&lt;br&gt;
''"And—he's not reeking with money like Smithy, but, he's a jolly good deal easier to touch for a small loan when a fellow's been disappointed about a postal order," added Bunter thoughtfully.&lt;br&gt;
''Peter Todd gazed at him.  Bunter evidently had his own original ideas about the qualities that were required in a Form captain!

From ''[[The Magnet]]'' #1258 ''"Bounder and Captain!"'' (1932)

In the classroom, Bunter's academic abilities are scarce to the point of non-existent.  He is the despair of his Form master, Mr Quelch. In this he is not helped by his extreme laziness and unwillingness to indulge in any academic work whatsoever.

Bunter's personal habits are lazy and slovenly.  He is always the last to rise from his bed in the morning and always chooses to remain in bed for a few extra minutes in preference to washing himself. His handkerchief is permanently filthy and his waistcoat usually displays prominent clues that reveal the ingredients of his breakfast that day.

{{Quote box|quote=Bunter was blinking now behind his big spectacles, and his spectacles were damp as he blinked.

In Bunter's fat circumference, under his many layers of fat, there was a heart, and in Bunter's heart at the present moment there was a horrible quake. His mother was ill! Bunter, for once, was thinking of someone other than himself. He was thinking of his mother. The mater was ill, and she wanted him! The poor old mater!

"Oh!" gasped Bunter. "Oh!"|source=''[[The Magnet]]'' (1931)&lt;ref name=Magnet&gt;{{Cite news | last = Richards | first = Frank | title = Billy Bunter's Bunk| date = 28 March 1931 | url = http://www.friardale.co.uk/Magnet/1931/1931.htm| accessdate = 27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=24%|align=left}}

A running theme at the beginning of each holiday season is Bunter's persistent attempts to avoid spending vacations with his family and instead gatecrash the holiday arrangements of one or more of his schoolfellows; and his schoolfellows' (generally unsuccessful) attempts to avoid Bunter's company.

He has two gifts: for cooking, and an uncanny ability to imitate voices (described as [[ventriloquism]] in the stories). This talent was developed in the early Magnet stories, commencing with Magnet No. 32 ''The Greyfriars Ventriloquist'' (1908). In a series of stories in which Bunter unsuccessfully attempts, in turn, a physical exercise regime, hypnotism, and mind reading, a visiting ventriloquism show inspires Bunter to believe that he is a born ventriloquist. ''"More like a born idiot"'' comments Bob Cherry – but Bunter perseveres and eventually masters the art. It is a talent unappreciated by his schoolfellows, since he generally uses it to make mischief, or, opportunistically, to get himself out of trouble.

Among Bunter's few virtues is an occasional tendency to display courage for the sake of others. To his credit, he is invariably in a state of extreme terror himself on such occasions. This characteristic was first seen in Magnet No. 364 ''Surprising the School'' (1915) when he saved his schoolmaster's niece, Cora Quelch, from an angry bull&lt;ref&gt;Fayne &amp; Jenkins, P.52&lt;/ref&gt; and was afterwards repeated on a number of other occasions. Unfortunately, Bunter's love of the limelight frequently leads him to spoil matters by boasting and exaggerating afterwards. Oddly enough, he also displays generosity, on the rare occasions when he is in possession of food or cash.

Billy Bunter's main redeeming feature is the very genuine love and concern he has for his mother.  This is seen in several stories, usually involving his mother suffering an illness, allowing a better side of Bunter's character to be seen. (Magnets #1016, #1206 and #1532).&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, P74-80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bunter as a plot driver===
For the first fifteen years of the Magnet stories, Bunter was one of the crowd. From the mid-1920s, just as Hamilton increasingly developed Bunter's comic potential, so he began to use Bunter's antics as a means to initiate and drive forward the plots.&lt;ref&gt;Fayne &amp; Jenkins, P.100&lt;/ref&gt;

Conspiratorial conversations would be overheard by Bunter, whether from the other side of a keyhole or from under the seat in a rail compartment while avoiding the ticket inspector. Bunter would frequently be under a table, or behind an armchair – often hiding from some outraged fellow whose food he had purloined – there to overhear some secret or piece of gossip. Such knowledge would swiftly be shared through Bunter's habit of gossiping. Letters would be purloined by Bunter and not reach the intended recipient. Bunter's ventriloquism skills would be used as a means of creating conflict between other characters. Whilst he was usually not the main protagonist in most of the stories, Bunter's influence as a comical interlude and as a plot driver was felt at every turn.&lt;ref&gt;Lofts &amp; Adley, P88-89&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[The Secret Seven (Frank Richards)|The Secret Seven]] series of 1934, the entire plotline is initiated by Bunter's stupidity, which causes a road accident that results in a number of leading characters being hospitalised.&lt;ref&gt;Fayne &amp; Jenkins, P.181-182&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bunter as a principal character===
During ''The Magnet'' era, Billy Bunter is not yet the permanent principal character he would become in the post-war era. The style of the stories is to allow each principal character to take a leading role in turn.  Stronger characters such as Remove Captain Harry Wharton, the hard and rebellious Herbert Vernon-Smith and Fifth form duffer Horace Coker are frequently given leading roles in their own series; and even lesser characters such as American junior Fisher T Fish and aspiring actor William Wibley would occasionally be brought to the fore in their own series.

In this way, Bunter took his turn with the rest, in a number of stories that placed him as the lead protagonist.  Some of the more notable examples include:

* The ''Bunter Court'' series from 1925 (Magnets #910 to #917) – by a combination of trickery and co-incidence, Bunter manages to obtain the tenancy of a stately home, Combermere Lodge, and passes it off as the infamous Bunter Court.  Despite the author's comment that this was one of the most contrived plots he had ever been forced to employ, this series is highly regarded by commentators.  It is the more remarkable that the character of Billy Bunter succeeds in being entertaining without the reader ever being invited to display the slightest affection or sympathy for him. After borrowing from his guests to pay the servants wages, and locking the estate agent, the butler and others into the cellar to hide his tracks, Bunter finally flees before receiving his just deserts.&lt;ref&gt;Fayne &amp; Jenkins, P102&lt;/ref&gt;    
* The ''Whiffles Circus'' series from 1928 (Magnets #1069 to #1076) – Billy Bunter assumes the identity of Mr Whiffles, the proprietor of a circus, by stealing his clothes, wig and false whiskers, and sustains the impersonation over the course of the storyline when all the circus hands mistake him for the proprietor.&lt;ref&gt;Fayne &amp; Jenkins, P111&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The ''Bunter £100 Boater Hat'' series from 1933 (Magnets #1325 to #1326) – tramp Harold Hinks steals a £100 note belonging to Vernon-Smith's father and hides it under the lining of Bunter's straw hat.  Unfortunately, Bunter is wearing a borrowed hat at the time and Mr Hinks' hapless attempts to recover the banknote by snatching a succession of wrong hats from Bunter's head make for entertaining reading. Charles Hamilton once stated his opinion this was one of the funniest stories he ever wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Fayne &amp; Jenkins, P177&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Popper Island Rebellion'' series from 1934 (Magnets #1374 to #1382) – Billy Bunter is expelled after being wrongfully accused of drenching Fifth Form master Mr Prout in ink. The Remove rise up in his support and build a fortified camp on Popper Island, which they successfully defend against a number of assaults by the prefects and other seniors.&lt;ref&gt;Fayne &amp; Jenkins, P180-181&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, the editors of ''The Magnet'' persuaded Charles Hamilton to drop the character of Billy Bunter altogether for several editions and attempt a storyline in the style of an action thriller. The result was the ''Ravenspur Grange'' series (Magnets #1122 to #1125) which prompted a strong outcry from the ''Magnet'' readership, dismayed at Bunter's disappearance.  Billy Bunter would never be absent from the stories again.&lt;ref&gt;Fayne &amp; Jenkins, P114&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racism===
Bunter himself often uses language that contemporary readers would characterise as racist. However, this attribute applies to Bunter himself rather than the stories in general in which both the protagonists and the narrative of the Greyfriars stories are unusually firm in rejecting racism.&lt;ref&gt;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/BillyBunter&lt;/ref&gt;

In an age when the word "nigger" was not yet regarded in the same pejorative sense that applies today, the Greyfriars stories consistently emphasised the offensive nature of the term from as early as 1922&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Wright, P.164-167&lt;/ref&gt; and the narratives even included unfashionable anti-British sentiments in stories set against the background of imperial India.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Wright, P.167&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Billy Bunter has two siblings: a younger sister, Elizabeth Gertrude ([[Bessie Bunter|Bessie]]), who attends the nearby Cliff House School, and a younger brother, Samuel Tuckless (Sammy), who is in the Second Form at Greyfriars School.  Bessie first appears in the Magnet No. 582 ''The Artful Dodger'' (1919), before appearing as a regular character in ''The School Friend'' later that year.&lt;ref name="greyfriarsindex.co.uk"&gt;http://www.greyfriarsindex.co.uk/pdf/magnet_index.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Bessie appears in a total of 116 ''Magnet'' stories. Sammy Bunter first appears in Magnet #144 ''Billy Bunter's Minor'' (1910) and appears in a further 291 '' Magnet'' stories.&lt;ref name="greyfriarsindex.co.uk"/&gt;

There is little love lost between the three, as is shown in this passage from one of the earlier stories:&lt;ref&gt;Lofts &amp; Audley. P.62&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
''Bessie was, in Billy's opinion, a cat.  Bessie's opinion of Billy could not be expressed so laconically.  Her vocabulary on the subject was very extensive indeed.  Only on one subject could Billy and Bessie agree.  That was on the subject of Sammy.  They heartily agreed that Sammy was a little beast.''
}}

Their father is Mr William Samuel Bunter, a portly, largely unsuccessful, stockbroker with a severe manner; although it is noted that "like many middle aged gentlemen, Mr. Bunter was better tempered after breakfast."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton-Wright, P.156&lt;/ref&gt; He is perpetually complaining about income tax and school fees and has little interest in his children. Written correspondence between Billy and his father consists of continual requests from Billy to supplement his pocket money; and continual refusals from his father to accede.  By contrast, Billy Bunter is particularly close to his mother, Mrs Amelia Bunter, a kindly lady who appears only briefly in seven stories.

Billy's cousin Walter Gilbert (Wally) Bunter was introduced in Magnet No. 333 ''The Dark Horse'' (1914)&lt;ref name="greyfriarsindex.co.uk"/&gt; and appears in a further 32 ''Magnet'' stories. He is Billy's exact double, excepting only for his spectacles, but is his opposite in every other respect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magnets.friardale.co.uk/Characters/B.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Other members of the Bunter family to appear briefly over the years include Billy Bunter's uncles James, George and Claude, his aunts Prudence and Claribel, his great-aunt Eliza Judith and (in a one-off story) Sir Foulkes Bunter and his son.

Bunter boasts of living at Bunter Court, a stately home with liveried servants and a fleet of chauffeured [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]] cars. On closer inspection, however, this turns out to be the more modest Bunter Villa in Surrey, with a maid, a cook and a single Ford car.
&lt;ref&gt;Lofts &amp; Audley. P.61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reprints==
Many stories which had originally seen publication in ''The Magnet'' were reprinted in the Schoolboys Own Libraries before World War II and again by Armada and Paul Hamlyn in the 1970s.  Most of the 1,683 issues of ''The Magnet'' were reprinted in hardback form by publisher W. Howard Baker, under his Howard Baker and Greyfriars Book Club imprints, between 1969 and 1990.

==Post-war stories==

=== Novels ===
Following the closure of ''The Magnet'' in 1940, Hamilton had little work; but he became known as the author of the Greyfriars stories following a newspaper interview he gave to the London ''[[Evening Standard]]''.

Although he had written many thousands of stories published between 1900 and 1940 by the Amalgamated Press, he had written them under dozens of pen names: so he himself was quite unknown prior to the appearance of the newspaper article. Nor was it even widely known, until then, that all of the stories written under those pen names were, in the main, all the work of one man.

Hamilton was not able to continue the Greyfriars saga immediately, as the Amalgamated Press claimed ownership to all the characters except  Billy Bunter who actually appeared in a Sparshott story in 1946. However, by 1947 they had relented, and Hamilton was then able to obtain a contract from publishers Charles Skilton for a series of hardback novels. The first of these, ''[[Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School (novel)|Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School]]'', was published in September 1947. It began a series that continued for the rest of Hamilton's life. In the 1950s the initial novels were reprinted by Cassells, who took over publication of the series, which continued until 1967, the final novels being published posthumously.

=== Radio ===
'''Billy Bunter''' has been adapted for radio as an [[audio play]] several times&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friardale.co.uk/Television%20and%20Radio/Television%20and%20Radio.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, the last occasion being a 90 minute adaptation of the novel ''Billy Bunter's Christmas Party'' broadcast on BBC Radio 4, as part of the series ''Saturday Night Theatre'', in December 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediafire.com/file/vabjv69sdvycuyf |title=Billy Bunter's Christmas Party - BBC Radio 4 - 1986-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, a series of short stories adapted from the novels of Charles Hamilton were performed by ''The Goodies'' (Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie, Tim Brooke-Taylor) for BBC radio, as six 15 minute dramas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediafire.com/folder/osfd7acqd61c2 |title=The Billy Bunter Stories - BBC Radio 2 - 1993 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A radio documentary about the character aired on the 40th anniversary of the closure of ''The Magnet''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediafire.com/file/bwc62yaikn044rm |title=Good Old Greyfriars - BBC Radio 4 - 1981-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Television ===
{{Main|Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School (TV series)}}
Billy Bunter was played by [[Gerald Campion]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090304202424/http://www.comicsuk.co.uk/GeraldCampion.htm Report of Gerald Campion's passing]: ComicsUK.co.uk website. Retrieved 4 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[BBC]] television series ''Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School''.  The series also featured [[Anthony Valentine]] as Harry Wharton, [[Michael Crawford]] as Frank Nugent, [[Jeremy Bulloch]] as Bob Cherry, [[Melvyn Hayes]] as Harold Skinner, [[John Woodnutt]] [[Raf De La Torre]], [[Kynaston Reeves]] and [[Jack Melford]] as Mr Quelch, [[Roger Delgado]] as Monsieur Charpentier and [[Kenneth Cope]] as school bully Gerald Loder.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044240/&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 52 half-hour episodes was broadcast over seven series, between 1952 and 1961, including three television specials. The television show was totally centred on Bunter, with the other characters playing only a peripheral role.

All the television scripts were written by Charles Hamilton. The programme's memorable theme music was the "[[Portsmouth (instrumental)|Portsmouth]]" section of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s ''[[Sea Songs]]''. The episodes were transmitted "live" in [[Black-and-white|black and white]] format, and a dozen still exist in the BBC's archive as [[Kinescopes|telerecordings]] (see also [[Wiping]]). The survivors are the complete third series (six episodes), one of the "specials", one episode from the fifth series, and four episodes from the sixth series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greyfriarsindex.co.uk/post1940/television.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stage ===
Billy Bunter appeared in several Christmas stage shows with different casts:
* 1958. ''Billy Bunter's Mystery Christmas'' ([[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], London)
* 1959. ''Billy Bunter Flies East'' ([[Victoria Palace Theatre]])
* 1960. ''Billy Bunter's Swiss Roll'' (Victoria Palace Theatre)
* 1961. ''Billy Bunter Shipwrecked'' (Victoria Palace Theatre)
* 1962. ''Billy Bunter's Christmas Circus'' ([[Queen's Theatre]])
* 1963. ''Billy Bunter meets Magic'' ([[Shaftesbury Theatre]])

=== Comics ===
After ''The Magnet'' closed in 1940, Bunter appeared in children's comics, as a strip cartoon character: initially, from 15 June 1940, he appeared in ''[[Knockout (UK comics)|Knockout]]'' (which, like ''The Magnet,'' was published by The Amalgamated Press). Although ''Knockout'' had begun only in 1939, it already had a circulation several times that of ''The Magnet''. [[C. H. Chapman|C&amp;nbsp;H&amp;nbsp;Chapman]], the last illustrator for ''The Magnet'', drew the first nine ''Knockout'' strips in 1939,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/chapman_ch.htm&lt;/ref&gt; after which several artists were tried, before [[Frank Minnitt]] established himself with a beaming and bouncy Bunter, which at first followed Chapman's style, then later branched into a style of his own, concentrating on slapstick humour. Soon the Famous Five vanished from the strip, replaced by Jones minor, who had all the good qualities Bunter lacked, but who was prone to being led astray by Bunter. The form-master, Mr Quelch, stayed (at least in name), but he lost his dignity and aloofness.

Minnitt continued producing the strip until his death in 1958. [[Reg Parlett]] then took over until ''Knockout'' ceased publication in 1961, when the strip transferred to ''[[Valiant (comic)|Valiant]]'' comic, and then to ''[[TV Comic]]'', where it ran until 1984. Bunter also appeared in many ''Knockout'' annuals, even on some covers.

C. H. Chapman drew a strip for ''[[The Comet (comic magazine)|The Comet]]'' comic in 1956, which featured the classical old Bunter of ''The Magnet'' and the Famous Five, consisting of twelve weeks of 2-page strips (24 pages in all). Altogether, Bunter's appearances in ''Comet'' lasted from March 1950 until June 1958, with picture stories from February 1952.

From 1955, Billy Bunter comic strips were published in the Netherlands, in the Dutch-language comic ''[[Sjors]]'', with the character renamed "Billie Turf". Bunter thus became one of the house characters of that comic and its successors, and so continued appearing in anthology-style collections in Dutch until the end of the 20th century. "Billie Turf" comic strip albums were published from 1963 onwards, and have continued into the 21st century. Three Billie Turf movies were made between 1978 and 1983, mostly spelling the name of the main character as "Billy Turf".

=== Appearances in other fiction ===
* Billy Bunter appears in Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's graphic novel ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', and still resides at the now closed Greyfriars in 1958 as an old man. He sells information about the former students of the school, which is supposed to have been a recruiting ground for spies and agents for the crown since the 16th century. To avoid copyright issues, as the character is still under copyright, the graphic novel only refers to the character by his first name.
* Bunter appears in the [[Viz (comic)|Viz]] cartoon strip 'Baxter Basics' (the title spoofing a slogan of the Conservative Party, 'Back to Basics') as Sir William Bunter, conservative MP for Greyfriars Central. The character was immediately killed off by Baxter, so that he could take over that Parliamentary seat.
* In ''Bunter Sahib'' by Daniel Green, Bunter's identical ancestor is placed in 19th century India.
* David Hughes in ''But for Bunter'' creates the idea that the Greyfriars stories were based on real people, and set out to find them and hear their stories. This echoed the theme of a contemporary BBC radio documentary, ''Whatever Happened to... Henry Samuel Quelch''.
* Cyril, a thinly veiled version of Billy Bunter, appears in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[The Celestial Toymaker]]''. As the character was still under copyright, a BBC continuity announcer was obliged to deny any deliberate similarity between the characters after the episodes aired.

[[Image:1807 BostonDirectory title page.png|100px|thumb|1807 Boston Directory [[title page]]]]
'''''The Boston Directory''''' of  [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], was first published in 1789. It contained "a list of the merchants, mechanics, traders, and others, of the town of Boston; in order to enable strangers to find the residence of any person."

'''[[Case mix]] index''' (CMI) is a relative value assigned to a [[diagnosis-related group]] of patients in a medical care environment. The CMI value is used in determining the allocation of resources to care for and/or treat the patients in the group.

==Resource Use Groups==

Patients are classified into groups having the same condition (based on main and secondary diagnosis, procedures, age), complexity ([[comorbidity]]) and needs. These groups are known as Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG), or Resource Use Groups (RUG).

Each DRG has a relative average value assigned to it that indicates the amount of resources required to treat patients in the group, as compared to all the other diagnosis-related groups within the system. The relative average value assigned to each group is its CMI.

==Hospital CMI==

The CMI of a hospital reflects the diversity, clinical complexity and the needs for resources in the population of all the patients in the hospital. 

The CMI value of a hospital can be used to adjust the average cost per patient (or per day) for a given hospital relative to the adjusted average cost for other hospitals by dividing the average cost per patient (or day) by the hospital's calculated CMI. The adjusted average cost per patient would reflect the charges reported for the types of cases treated in that year. If a hospital has a CMI greater than 1.00, their adjusted cost per patient or per day will be lower and conversely if a hospital has a CMI less than 1.00, their adjusted cost will be higher.

'''''Example:'''''

A link to the 2011 spreadsheet of the CMI for all US providers is located here
[http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/FY-2011-IPPS-Final-Rule-Home-Page-Items/CMS1237932.html]

An analysis of that file shows that there are 3619 hospital records. The number of cases for the hospitals ranges from a low of 1 to a high of 36,282 cases at Florida Hospital in Orlando, FL (Medicare ID 100007). That hospital has a Case Mix Index of 1.57. The mean number of cases across all the hospitals in the database is 3,098 with a standard deviation of 3,102.  As far as the Case Mix Index, the average is 1.37 with a minimum of .58 and a max of 3.73 and a standard deviation of 0.31.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49571">A '''comparison of rugby league and rugby union''' is possible because of the games' similarities and shared origins.

Initially, following the 1895 split in [[rugby football]], [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]] differed in administration only. Soon, however, the rules of rugby league were modified, resulting in two distinctly different forms of rugby. After 100 years, in 1995 rugby union joined rugby league and most other forms of football as an openly [[professional sport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Ian|title=The bluffer's guide|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/09/1065676101199.html|accessdate=27 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=10 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherent similarities between rugby league and rugby union have at times led to the possibility of a merger of the two variants&lt;ref name="thisislondon2000"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Jones   | first = Chris  | title = It's all a code merger mystery  | work = [[London Evening Standard]]  | place = UK  | publisher = ES London Limited  | date = 9 October 2000  | url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/sport/article-849199-its-all-a-code-merger-mystery.do  | accessdate =21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and experimental [[hybrid sports|hybrid games]] have been played that use a mix of the two sports' rules.&lt;ref name="growden1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Growden|first=Greg|title=Hybrid rugby union-league experiment|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/news/4994642/Hybrid-rugby-union-league-experiment|accessdate=22 June 2012|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|History of rugby league|History of rugby union}}

Rugby union was originally referred to as [[rugby football]]. During the early development of rugby football different schools used different rules, on many occasions agreeing upon them shortly before commencement of the game.&lt;ref name="Marshall13-14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Marshall|1951|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, English clubs met to form the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU). Rugby football spread to Australia and New Zealand, with games being played in the early to mid nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="aruhistory"&gt;[http://www.rugby.com.au/about_the_aru/history_of_the_aru/history_of_the_aru,183.html History of the ARU] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024111441/http://www.rugby.com.au/about_the_aru/history_of_the_aru/history_of_the_aru%2C183.html |date=24 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, charges of [[Professional sports#Resistance to professionalism|professionalism]] were laid against [[Yorkshire]] clubs after they compensated players for missing work. A proposal to pay players up to six shillings when they missed work because of match commitments was voted down by the RFU. On 27 August 1895, prominent [[Lancashire]] clubs declared that they would support their Yorkshire colleagues in their proposal to form a professional organization and the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]], usually called the Northern Union (NU), was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Baker | first =Andrew | title =100 years of rugby league: From the great divide to the Super era | newspaper = [[The Independent|Independent, The]]| pages = | publisher =independent.co.uk | date =20 August 1995 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/100-years-of-rugby-league-from-the-great-divide-to-the-super-era-1597130.html | accessdate =25 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rugby union authorities issued sanctions against clubs, players and officials involved in the offshoot group, including [[amateur]]s who played with or against Northern Union sides. After the schism the separate codes were named "rugby union" for the RFU code and "rugby league" for the NU code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rugby's great split: class, culture and the origins of rugby league football|author=Tony Collins|pages=87–120|chapter=Schism 1893–1895|edition=2nd|publisher=Routlage|year=2006|isbn=0-415-39616-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Black]] [[George William Smith (sportsman)|George William Smith]] joined with [[Albert Henry Baskerville]] to form a team of professional rugby players. George Smith cabled a friend in Sydney and three professional matches were arranged between a New South Wales rugby team before continuing onto the UK. This game was played under the rugby union laws and it was not until the team, nicknamed the [[1907-08 All Golds tour|All Golds]], arrived in Leeds that they learnt the new Northern Union laws. Meanwhile, in Sydney a meeting was organised to look at forming a professional rugby competition in Australia. The meeting resolved that a "[[New South Wales Rugby Football League]]" (NSWRFL) should be formed, to play the Northern Union rules. The first season of the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership|NSWRFL competition]] was played in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1908|1908]], and has continued to be played every year since.

During rugby league's [[1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]], the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] tried to arrange a match in Paris, but opposition from the [[Rugby Football Union]]-aligned [[French Rugby Federation]] made it impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France rugby league split from rugby union in the 1930s. In 1948 the French instigated the formation of the [[International Rugby League Board]] as the world governing body for rugby league. France, New Zealand, Britain and Australia (who joined a few months later) were the founding countries. The [[International Rugby Board|International Rugby Football Board]] (IRFB) had formed prior to the schism in 1886 and remained the international governing body for rugby union, although it originally only consisted of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. Australia, New Zealand and South Africa joined the IRFB in 1948, France in 1978 and Argentina, Canada, Italy and Japan in 1991.

On 26 August 1995 the IRFB, now known as the International Rugby Board, declared rugby union an "open" game and thus removed all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the RFU |url=http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |work=[[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5q61bxH6m?url=http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |archivedate=29 May 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' at the time, "Thirteen-man rugby league has shown itself to be a faster, more open game of better athletes than the other code. Rugby union is trying to negotiate its own escape from amateurism, with some officials admitting that the game is too slow, the laws too convoluted to attract a larger TV following".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Thomsen |first=Ian |title=Australia Faces England at Wembley: A Final of Rugby Favorites |work=The New York Times |place=USA |pages= |publisher=nytimes.com |date=28 October 1995 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/28/sports/28iht-rugby.t.html |accessdate=5 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wIVSRuN4?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/28/sports/28iht-rugby.t.html |archivedate=6 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
{{see also|Football (word)}}

Although both rugby codes are forms of football, in many places, it could cause confusion as "football" is understood to mean [[Association football]], [[Gridiron football]], [[Gaelic football]] or [[Australian rules football]] depending on the country (or indeed region of the country). In much of the rugby union-playing world, the sport of rugby league is infrequently played and rugby union is commonly known simply as "rugby"; in countries where both codes are played, there is a need to distinguish between the codes of rugby.

In the United Kingdom, rugby union or rugby league fans rarely refer to their sport as "football" as in most cases this would refer to [[association football]]. Across the United Kingdom, rugby union is usually referred to simply as 'rugby' but in the [[North of England]], the word 'rugby' could refer to either sport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1493308_tributes-to-super-fit-glossop-rugby-ace-alex-kaiser-found-dead-in-his-van|title=Tributes to super-fit Glossop rugby ace Alex Kaiser found dead in his van|date=9 May 2012|newspaper=Manchester Evening News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=St Helens bar has licence suspended after rugby player allegedly assaulted|author=Janine Yaqoob|newspaper=Liverpool Echo|date=13 April 2012|url= http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2012/04/13/st-helens-bar-has-licence-suspensed-after-rugby-player-allegedly-assaulted-100252-30749399/#ixzz1yPhXBojQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; but usually means "rugby league". The nickname "rugger", which developed in England's elite schools, almost always refers to rugby union.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In Australia and New Zealand, rugby league is usually known as "league" or "football" with the latter term potentially confusing as [[Australian rules football]] and [[Association football]] could also be called football. Rugby union is often simply referred to as "rugby" without the ambiguity that this term carries in the UK.

In France, rugby union is called ''rugby à quinze'' (rugby with 15) or simply "rugby" whilst rugby league is known as ''rugby à treize'' (rugby with 13) or ''jeu à treize'' (game with 13) or ''treize'' (13).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francerugby.fr/regles/acueil_regles.html Règles du rugby à XV par francerugby.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://perso.wanadoo.fr/lmprugby13/regles.html#joueurs Régles du Rugby à XIII, codification empruntée au site de la Ligue régionale de Midi-Pyrénées]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarities between the two codes===
The two forms of rugby share the same basic rules of the game and use a similar-shaped ovoid ball. The aim is to score more points through [[Try|tries]], [[Try#Conversion|conversions]], penalty goals and [[Drop goal (rugby)|drop goals]] than the opposition within the 80 minutes of play.

Goals are scored when the ball is kicked between the two posts and over the cross-bar, either during open play or as the result of a penalty. A try is scored when the ball is touched down on or beyond the defending team's goal-line. The try-scoring side is given the chance to score two additional points by kicking a conversion similar to a penalty goal attempt from a point along a line which is perpendicular to the place where the try had been scored.

The ball can be taken forward in three ways — by kicking, by a player running with it, or as the result of a set-piece. The ball can be passed from hand to hand between teammates in a backward or sideways direction; it may not be passed forwards although it can be kicked forwards. Dropping the ball in a forwards direction results in a scrum, a set-piece that restarts the game, except on the sixth tackle in league where the game restarts with a handover to the opposition.

Only the player holding the ball may be tackled. A rugby tackle is an attempt to bring the ball carrier to the ground or to stop his forward progress. Play restarts with the ball being transferred to another player.

The playing positions are divided into "backs" — generally faster and more mobile who score most of the points, and the larger, stronger "forwards" who are involved in the more physical aspects of rugby and generally do more tackling.

===Possession===

A big difference in gameplay between the two games is that rugby league has shed from its laws several opportunities for possession to be contested that rugby union has retained: contesting the ball after the tackle, on the ground in rucks and through mauls.&lt;ref name="telfer2010-05-05"&gt;{{cite web|last=Telfer |first=Jim |title=It’s Le Crunch for Magners League |url=http://sport.stv.tv/rugby/175081-its-le-crunch-for-magners-league/ |publisher=[[STV (TV network)|STV]] |accessdate=25 July 2010 |authorlink=Jim Telfer |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rUuLpsQ3?url=http://sport.stv.tv/rugby/175081-its-le-crunch-for-magners-league/ |archivedate=25 July 2010 |date=5 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the ball goes into touch, possession in rugby union is contested through a [[Line-out (rugby union)|line-out]], while in rugby league a scrum restarts play.

In union the attacking team can hold onto and use the ball for as long as they are able, while the opposition's aim is to take possession of the ball from them. In league each team can be [[six tackle rule|tackled six times]] before handing over possession; moreover, the action stops after each successful tackle (i.e., the ball is not contested after a tackle). After being tackled five times, the attacking team will usually kick the ball either in an attacking kick or for territory. As the ball can only be contested during a [[one on one tackle]] in league there is less scope for a turnover to occur than in rugby union.&lt;ref name="collins2010-05-06"/&gt; A study commissioned by the IRB found that between the years 2002 and 2004 possession was retained by the attacking team in 13 out of 14 tackles in rugby union.&lt;ref name="collins2010-05-06"&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins |first=Tony |title=Mythbusters: The 'Contest for Possession' |url=http://rugbyreloaded.blogspot.com/2010/05/mythbusters-contest-for-possession.html |publisher=Rugby Reloaded |accessdate=25 July 2010 |authorlink=Tony Collins (historian) |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rUpCLTR0?url=http://rugbyreloaded.blogspot.com/2010/05/mythbusters-contest-for-possession.html |archivedate=25 July 2010 |date=6 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins has argued that the six tackle rule in rugby league offers a more even distribution of possession despite fewer opportunities to contest it.&lt;ref name="collins2010-05-06"/&gt; In both games the attacking team loses possession if they drop or pass the ball forward, which results in a scrum being awarded to the defending team.

In union possession can also be contested at line-outs (played after the ball has gone into touch) and scrums. In the same study it was found that the team with the ball at a scrum regained possession 90 percent of the time, while the team with the ball at a lineout regained possession 80 percent of the time.&lt;ref name="collins2010-05-06"/&gt; League does not have a lineout, but does utilise a scrum to restart play. It is uncommon for modern rugby league scrums to be contested, with the side awarded the scrum almost always gaining possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rugby league greats of different eras say rugby league scrum is a showpiece of the modern gam|author=Christopher Boy|publisher=Fox Sports|date=29 March 2011|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/league/nrl-premiership/rugby-league-greats-of-different-eras-say-rugby-league-scrum-is-still-relevant-in-the-modern-game/story-fn2mcuj6-1226029371347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possession can also be contested following kicks to restart play from the halfway, 22 metre in both games (and from the goal line in league).

Possession may change the same ways in both games:
# When the ball is kicked to the opposing team, this can be done at any time but it is normal to [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] on the last tackle in rugby league.
# Following an unsuccessful kick at goal. If the kick at goal misses and goes dead, play is restarted with a drop out (at the 22 metre line in union and 20 metres in league).
# When an opposing player intercepts a pass.
# When the player in possession drops the ball and it is recovered by an opposition player.
# If a player knocks the ball forward or throws a forward pass the other team is awarded a scrum. In somes cases, the referee may allow play to continue by the team picking up a dropped ball under the advantage rule.
# If a player commits an illegal play the opposing team is awarded a penalty and will receive the ball.

Possession may change in rugby league in a number of unique ways:
# In rugby league if the ball goes out of play, the opposition are awarded a scrum. If this is from a kick going into touch on the full this is called [[ball back]] and the scrum is formed where contact with the ball was made. Otherwise, under recent rule changes, the scrum is formed 20 metres from the point of touch. Penalties and 40/20 kicks are exceptions to this rule.
#If a one-on-one tackle is attempted, the tackler can legally strip the ball from the attacking player as long as the referee has not called "held" or the attacking player has fallen to the ground to indicate a completed tackle.
# an automatic handover takes place when the team in possession runs out of tackles, or a knock on happens on the sixth tackle.

Possession may change in rugby union in a number of unique ways
# In rugby union if the ball goes out of play the opposition may be awarded a [[Line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]. The opposition are awarded a line out if the team in possession kicks the ball out of play and they have not been awarded a penalty before the kick.
# In rugby union the attacking team may lose possession in a scrum, line out, maul, ruck or tackle.

===Tackling===
{{See also|Tackle (football move)}}

In both games tackling is permitted to either bring down the player in possession of the ball or prevent him from making forward progress. Tackling or interfering with a player who is not in possession of the ball is not permitted. Tripping with the leg is not allowed in either code. However, in rugby league, if a tackling player has both hands on the ball carrier, he is allowed to use his legs to bring him to ground.

In rugby league, a tackle is deemed to be complete when the elbow of the arm holding the ball touches the ground, or the player is held in an upright tackle. The ball cannot be further advanced and a play-the-ball or handover must take place. In rugby union, a tackle is deemed to be complete when the player in possession is held on the ground; that player must play the ball (either releasing it, passing it, or if over the try line grounding the ball) immediately. In rugby league a [[Playing rugby league#Play-the-ball|play the ball]] takes place after each tackle. In rugby union, play does not stop when a player is forced to the ground in a tackle, as the tackled player must immediately play the ball, and the tackler must roll away, which will generally mean a [[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]] will form.

The laws of rugby league specifically outlaw the so-called "voluntary tackle": players are not allowed to go to ground unless they are effectively tackled by an opponent, though in practice this rule is rarely applied. There was no equivalent law in rugby union, in the past going to ground with the ball and protecting it was practised, but in the modern game deliberately falling on the ground to gain an advantage is outlawed by Law 14: "The game is to be played by players who are on their feet. A player must not make the ball unplayable by falling down." A player who falls to ground with the ball or on it must immediately release or pass the ball, or get up with it.

===Scoring===
Union and league have the same ways of scoring, but there are significant differences in the points awarded, and a few minor differences in the laws governing the scoring of tries.

The [[try]] is the main way of scoring in both codes; there are [[Try#Scoring a try|some subtle differences]] between the two codes, but the most obvious difference is that a try is worth 5 points in rugby union and 4 points in rugby league. In both games, a [[Try#Conversion|conversion]] following a try is worth 2 points. A player tackled just short of the try-line in rugby union can legitimately reach across it and place the ball down for a try. This is not allowed in rugby league unless the momentum of the player continues to take him over the line in one continuous movement. If the tackle is complete, such a move would constitute a "double movement" and the try would be disallowed.

A [[drop goal]] is worth 3 points in union and 1 in league. A [[Penalty (rugby)|penalty goal]] is worth 3 points in union and 2 points in league.

===Laws===

Use of a penalty box (or "[[sin bin]]") was introduced by rugby league in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gatt|first=Ray|title=Ella stars and bears out Big Jack's faith|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19810330&amp;id=EJ9WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3uYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1255,11427494|accessdate=2 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=30 March 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rugby union had been experimenting with the same concept since 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scots against sin bin|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d-89AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zEgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6422,5903207&amp;dq=rugby+union+sin+bin&amp;hl=en|accessdate=2 June 2012|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=24 March 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was not formally sanctioned until 2001.&lt;ref name="cleary2001"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cleary|first=Mick|title=World Cup play-offs abandoned|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/3002507/World-Cup-play-offs-abandoned.html|accessdate=2 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]]|date=4 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Video referee]] technology was first used for rugby league in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reuter|title=Aussie rebels to follow Euro lead|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F_5OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XBUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1210,3030619|accessdate=2 June 2012|newspaper=[[New Straits Times]]|date=8 October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for rugby union in 2001.&lt;ref name="cleary2001"/&gt;

In rugby league the ball may be thrown or knocked out of play deliberately, while in union those are penalty offences. Kicking the ball out of play is legal in both codes.

When taking free or penalty kicks with a "tap and go" option, rugby league permits a stylised kick with the ball being tapped against the foot or lower leg while union requires the ball to leave the hands of the kicker. This difference in emphasis on a relatively trivial phase of play can be seen as indicative of the core differences between the games. In league, the kick is stylised as its purpose is to restart the game and to move to the run and tackle main play as quickly as possible. In union, where ''every'' phase of play has some element of competition, the trivial need to release the ball at any kick can result in a fumble that may give the opposition a chance to either contest possession or, if "knocked-on", will cause them to be awarded a scrum.

==Pitch==
{{Further|Rugby league playing field}}
[[File:NRL Rugby League field.svg|thumb|left|200px|A rugby league pitch]]
[[File:RugbyPitchMetricDetailed.svg|thumb|right|200px|A rugby union pitch]]

A rugby league pitch is between 112 and 122 metres long by 68&amp;nbsp;m wide. The distance between try-lines is always 100 metres. There are lines going across the field which mark every ten metres. An in-goal area extends six to eleven metres beyond each goal line. At the goal line is a set of goal posts in the shape of the letter 'H', used for other forms of point scoring: [[Drop goal (rugby)|drop goal]], penalty and [[Try#Conversion|conversion]].

A rugby union pitch is a maximum of 144 metres long by 70&amp;nbsp;m wide. The length from try line to try line is always 100 metres: the only varying distances on a rugby union field are the width of the playing field, and the distance from try line to the dead-ball line. Lines are painted at the dead-ball line, try line, 22-metre line, 10-metre line (broken line) and halfway. Lines are also located 5 metres away from the try line and touch line and 15 metres away from the touch line. At the goal line is a set of goal posts in the shape of the letter 'H', used for other forms of point scoring: [[Drop goal (rugby)|drop goal]], penalty and [[Try#Conversion|conversion]].

Despite the two different pitch sizes since the removal restrictions on professionalism by the RFU in 1995, it has been possible for clubs to share facilities, including pitches. A notable example is [[Leeds Rhinos]] and [[Yorkshire Carnegie]], both part of the Leeds Rugby group, who share [[Headingley Stadium]].{{clear left}}

==Players==
{{Further|Rugby league positions|Rugby union positions}}

A maximum of 15 players can play rugby union at any one time whereas rugby league permits 13 players. In both games, the positions are divided into "backs" and "forwards".

Many of the positions have similar names but in practice are very different. The position known as 'flanker' is not in rugby league; however the second row in rugby league are loose like the flankers in rugby union while the lock / loose forward in rugby league is similar to the number 8 in rugby union. In the backs, rugby league centres are split into left and right centre rather than inside and outside centres.

The reduction in the importance of the scrum and the removal of the line-out from rugby league, has meant it is a faster free flowing game. Very different skill sets and body types needed for the different positions has become more obvious as union players specialise more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnrl.com/news/league-v-union-goes-court|title=League V Union goes to court|accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, props and hookers in rugby union tend to be among the physically strongest and heaviest players with high levels of scrummaging and mauling skills, but traditionally with limited speed and ball-handling skills. In rugby league, props are physically big, straight running forwards whose job it is to set the platform and get the go forward while still possessing agility and good ball handling skills. Locks in union tend to be very tall and high jumpers, as this helps at line-outs; while as this is not a necessity for league; the two second rowers and the loose forward / lock are mobile with speed across the park who can off-load on attack and contain and enforce on defence. They are similar to the loose forward trio of flankers and number eight in rugby union. Depending on their speed and ball playing skills, lock forwards in rugby league can generally play as both a forward and as an extra five-eight.

Scrum-half is a specialized position in rugby union and similar to the hooker in league: the number 9 initiates most moves by his or her team and must be an excellent passer of the ball in rugby union as with league. In rugby league any player can act from dummy half, however, in the professional modern game it is a specialised job for the hooker to instigate and direct the forward platform. He must also be able to probe with a running and varied kicking game from dummy half while still possessing strong and effective tackling.

The similarity between the two games has meant that players can switch between the two codes. League initially recruited big name players from union, like [[Herbert "Dally" Messenger]] in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-06-24/dally-messenger-reinstated-to-nswru-record-books/79020 Dally Messenger reinstated to NSWRU record books - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the RFU responded by banning any player that played rugby league for life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfu.com/TwickenhamStadium/WorldRugbyMuseum/RugbyHistory/AmateurEra The Amateur Era&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413022851/http://www.rfu.com/TwickenhamStadium/WorldRugbyMuseum/RugbyHistory/AmateurEra |date=13 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A push into converting union players to rugby league, such as All Blacks [[John Anthony Gallagher|John Gallagher]], [[Frano Botica]], [[Matthew Ridge]] and [[Va'aiga Tuigamala]], occurred during the late 1980s and into the 1990s.&lt;ref name="irishrugby.ie"&gt;[http://www.irishrugby.ie/news/11928.php Irish Rugby : News Archive : Rugby Codes Are Closer Than Ever&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; When rugby union became professional league players were allowed to play for rugby union teams, leading to a reversal in cross-code switching. Gallagher, Botica and Tuigamala returned to union, while leading league players such as [[Jason Robinson (rugby player)|Jason Robinson]], [[Wendell Sailor]], [[Mat Rogers]], [[Lote Tuqiri]], [[Henry Paul]] and [[Iestyn Harris]], took up rugby union contracts.&lt;ref name="irishrugby.ie"/&gt; Sailor, Rogers, Tuqiri, Paul and Harris subsequently switched back to rugby league. Players who achieve play international rugby in both codes are known as [[List of dual-code rugby internationals|dual-code internationals]].

==Cross-code games==
In 1909, when the new "Northern Union" code was still in its infancy, a match between the [[Australia national rugby league team|Kangaroos]] and the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]] was played before a crowd of around 20,000, with the rugby league side winning, 29–26.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kangaroos v. Wallabies|work=West Coast Times|place =New Zealand|page=4|date=6 September 1909|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=WCT19090906.2.33.3|accessdate =3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the wartime Emergency League suspended, [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds Rugby League]] reverted to rugby union during World War I to play a one-off challenge game against the Royal Navy Depot from Plymouth in 1917. This was precursor to the following Christmas when two Challenge games were organised between the two sides but this time with one of each code. The Navy won the union game, 9–3, on Christmas Eve but proved equally adept at league recording a 24–3 win on 28 December. During World War II, the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] relaxed its restrictions on rugby league players playing rugby union. In 1943, a Northern Command army rugby league side defeated a Northern Command union side, 18–11, at Headingley under rugby union laws. The following year a Combined Services rugby league side beat a Combined Services union side, 15–10, at Bradford again at rugby union. These were the only league v union matches played until 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napit.co.uk/viewus/infobank/rugby/superleague/history.php The History Of Rugby League&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hybrid Rugby.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Bronson Harrison]] of the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] playing in a 2015 hybrid rugby match]]
With both sports becoming professional matches between union and league teams have been played. In May 1996, [[Bath Rugby]] and [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan RLFC]], who were then England's top union and league sides respectively, made history by [[Clash of the Codes (rugby)|playing against each other at both codes of rugby]]. Wigan won, 82–6, in the first match, played under league rules, and lost the second, 44–19, under union rules. Since then other games have been played between union and league teams using the laws of one of the codes, or in some cases using a different set of laws for each half.

Since the two match series in 1996, there has only been one similar endeavour to bring together union and league. In January 2003, St Helens rugby league took on Sale rugby union in a single game played at Knowsley Road, intended to have one half under league rules and the other under union rules. Unlike Bath, who were to all intents and purposes still the amateur side they had been, Sale had the benefit of almost a decade of professionalism to improve both strength and fitness that was necessary for them to adapt to the constant tackling required in rugby league. Sale prevailed against St Helens in front of a fierce St Helens home crowd at Knowsley Road, winning the match 41–39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/2700407.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Sale spring cross-code shock|date=2003-01-27 |accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

Traditionally, the two rugbys have been seen as divided along class lines, with union associated more with the middle class, and league with the working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowden|first=David|title=Tackling rugby union’s superiority complex|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/7339|accessdate=27 May 2012|newspaper=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]|date=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main reasons for the split was union's enforcement of the amateur principle, meaning that working class players could not afford to take time off work to play the sport.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/working-class-formed-a-league-of-their-own/story-e6frexni-1111118120858&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, rugby union is widely regarded as an "establishment" sport, played mostly by members of the [[upper classes|upper]] and [[middle classes]]. For example, many students at [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]s play rugby union.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Buchler. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmcumeds/99/99ap22.htm Appendices to the Minutes of Evidence to Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, rugby league has traditionally been seen as a [[working class]] pursuit.

In Wales, rugby union is associated with small village teams which consisted of coal miners and other industrial workers playing on their days off.&lt;ref&gt;Sommerville, D. (1997). The Encyclopedia of Rugby Union. Aurum Press, UK. {{ISBN|1-85410-481-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, the two codes were also strongly divided down class lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=180|title=Rugby's great split: class, culture and the origins of rugby|author=Tony Collins|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for both codes is concentrated in [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. The same perceived class barrier as exists between the two games in England also occurs in these states, fostered by rugby union's prominence and support at [[Public and private education in Australia|private schools]].&lt;ref name="Collins Paper"&gt;Collins, T. (2005). "Australian Nationalism and Working-Class Britishness: The Case of Rugby League Football." History Compass, Vol. 3, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand, rugby league is still considered to be a lower class game by many, or a game for "westies" referring to lower class western suburbs of Auckland and more recently the poorer southern Auckland where the game is popular. It is also popular on the West Coast of New Zealand. {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In France, rugby union is widely played and has a strong tradition in the [[Basque people|Basque]], [[Occitania|Occitan]], and [[Catalan people|Catalan]] areas {{citation needed|date=January 2016}} along the border regions between Spain and France. It rivals the popularity of [[association football]]. Rugby league has historically been played in much the same region. {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Finance and scale==

In the UK, the "two codes" of rugby are very different in scale and turnover. The turnover of the RFL was reported as £19m in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.therfl.co.uk/docs/2014%20RFL%20Annual%20Report.pdf RFL Annual report for 2014&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the turnover of the Rugby Football Union in 2014 was £150m.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/rugby/rfu-turnover-of-more-than-150m-allows-for-increased-investment-across-all-levels-of-rugby-9861952.html RFU Turnover of more than 150 Million Pounds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of rugby union players in England is 1.99 million (predominantly school and children's teams following a RFU drive to increase participation) but which includes 131,000 senior male players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000002/index.html International Rugby Board - ENGLAND&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of players participating in any capacity in Rugby League in England (including wheelchair users) is about 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.code13rugbyleague.com/2012/02/10/player-participation-passes-100000/&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia in 2013, rugby league had 1,430,367 participants in the sport (including school clinics), and 167,533 registered players.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://rugbyleague2013.nrl.com/ NRL Rugby League 2013&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Rugby League Commission reported a gross revenue of [[Australian dollar|$]]185,668,873 and a gross profit of $4,675,845 in the 2012 financial year.&lt;ref&gt;http://rugbyleague2013.nrl.com/PDF/NRL_Financial_Statement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Rugby Union in 2012 had 323,115 participants, including 50,000 registered juniors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://activemagazine.smedia.com.au/activemagazine/arudemo2012/ rugby.com.au&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The ARU in 2012 had gross revenues of $96.6M, but had a net deficit of $8.3M. A significant portion of Rugby Union's revenue is derived from the national team touring overseas and visiting tours, while Rugby League's is largely generated by its strong domestic league.

The number of rugby union players in New Zealand is estimated to be 129,000, with 35,721&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; playing rugby league.

Rugby union generally has a broader reach around the world, largely due to the unrestricted spread of the game across commonwealth countries, promulgated by British armed forces, during a time when the armed forces inexplicably banned rugby league in the early 20th century{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. For example, it is a popular sport in a number of countries such as South Africa and Argentina.

==International competitions==

The oldest international rugby union competition is the [[Six Nations Championship]], starting in 1883 with games played between England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. France joined in 1910 and Italy in 2000. In 1996 the Southern Hemisphere teams of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand started their own annual international competition known as the Tri Nations; it adopted its current name of [[The Rugby Championship]] when Argentina joined in 2012.

Rugby union was previously a medal sport at four Olympic games, in Paris (1900 and 1924), London (1908) and Antwerp (1920), and returned to the Olympics in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympic_games/8292584.stm |title=Golf &amp; rugby voted into Olympics |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 October 2009 |accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Rugby sevens|sevens]] form. Rugby union sevens is a core event at both the [[Commonwealth Games]] and the [[Asian Games]].

The major annual international competition in rugby league is the [[Rugby League Four Nations|Four Nations]], first played in 1999. It originally involved Britain, Australia and New Zealand before expanding to include a fourth invited nation in 2009. Rugby league introduced its [[Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]] in 1954 and it has been held intermittently since, in various formats. Rugby union's first [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] was held in 1987 and both are contested every four years.

{{Reflist|group="note"|30em|refs=
&lt;ref group="note" name="NetscapeVersion"&gt;There are five different products which all carry the name Netscape: Netscape versions 1 to 4, properly called ''Netscape Navigator'', was a browser based on the original Netscape engine. Netscape 4 also was available as an [[Internet suite]], properly called ''Netscape Communicator''. Netscape 6 and 7 was a new [[Internet]] suite based on the [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko engine]] and the [[Mozilla]] Application Suite user interface. Netscape 8, properly called ''Netscape Browser'', was a distinct browser based on Firefox that could use either the Gecko (Firefox) or Trident (Internet Explorer) engine. Netscape resumed use of the ''Navigator'' name from ''Netscape Navigator 9.0 beta 1''. See [[Netscape]] for more info.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--IsGoogleChromeOpenSource is defined previously because of nested ref tags--&gt;
}}

==Operating system support==
Browsers are [[compiled]] to run on certain [[operating system]]s, without [[emulator|emulation]].

This list is not exhaustive, but rather reflects the most common OSes today (e.g. [[Netscape Navigator]] was also developed for [[OS/2]] at a time when [[macOS|macOS 10]] did not exist) but does not include the growing appliance segment (for example, the [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] web browser has gained a leading role for use in mobile phones, smartphones, the Nintendo DS and Wii, and Personal Digital Assistants, and is also used in some smart TVs).
Both the web browser and OS means most recent version, example: Windows 8 with Internet Explorer 10.

{{Reflist|group="note"|30em|refs=
&lt;ref group="note" name="IESpell"&gt;Spell checking can be added by installing an add-on like ieSpell.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="lynx-spell"&gt;Lynx is able to edit text with an external editor, which can provide spell checking.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--&lt;ref group="note" name="IESecSep"&gt;[[Internet Explorer]] can handle per-site settings for [[HTTP cookie|cookies]]. Furthermore you can specify "trusted" and "untrusted" sites and assign pre-set rights to both categories.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="IESpelling"&gt;[[Internet Explorer 10]] supports spell checking.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="InPrivate"&gt;[[Internet Explorer 8]] supports InPrivate Browsing.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="MozSecSep"&gt;[[Mozilla]] based [[Web browser|browsers]] like [[Firefox]], [[SeaMonkey]] and [[Flock (web browser)|Flock]] can handle per-site settings for [[HTTP cookie|cookies]], [[pop-up ad|pop-ups]], [[Add-on (Mozilla)|add-on]] installs and images. For more settings, an add-on is needed&amp;nbsp;~ for example, [[NoScript]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--OmniWebSecSep defined above because of nested ref tags--&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="KonqDownload"&gt;For the download manager kdenetwork needs to be installed.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="KonqPerSite"&gt;Konqueror can handle per-site settings for [[HTTP cookies|cookies]], pop-ups, [[JavaScript]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[NPAPI|NPAPI modules]] (e.g. [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="OpBookmarks"&gt;Opera versions before 15 had bookmarks. Newer Opera versions use a different concept called "Stash" instead.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="OpForm"&gt;Opera can auto-complete forms with your personal information and website usernames. Also there is extension [https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/autocomplete/ AutoComplete] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725092954/https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/autocomplete/ |date=25 July 2014 }} which can complete forms with form history.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="chromePerSite"&gt;Starting with version 4, Google Chrome can disable Cookies, Images, JavaScript, Plugins, Popups, and Geolocation individually.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="K-MeleonToolbar"&gt;Through the Privacy toolbar, K-Meleon Versions 1.5 and 1.6, can individually disable Cookies, Images, JavaScript, Popups, and Plugins (e.g. [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] and Java).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--pwd defined above because of nested ref tags--&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="firefoxPrivateMode"&gt;[[Firefox 3#Version 3.5|Firefox 3.5]] adds the ''Privacy mode''. Older versions of Firefox can use the Stealther extension.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="WindowsUpdate"&gt;There is no online update facility built into IE, but it gets updated by [[Windows Update]] when enabled. As of Version 10 automatic silent update is the default setting in Internet Explorer. In Microsoft Edge, the option to disable automatic updates via the about dialog is not included.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="QupForm"&gt;Available as a PIM plugin which is disabled by default, but it is part of default installation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="search-toolbar-merged"&gt;Lacks search toolbar, but search URL autocompletion provided via addressbar.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="patch"&gt;Developers distribute patch enabling this functionality.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="external"&gt;This functionality is handled via third-party software by browser's design.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="custom-cookies"&gt;This browser allows choosing a custom cookie jar, making cookies from other sessions unavailable to new session.&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about what common accessibility features are implemented natively (without third-party add-ons). Browsers that do not support [[Pop-up ad|pop-ups]] have no need for pop-up blocking abilities, so that field is marked as N/A.

&lt;ref group="note" name="PageZooming"&gt;Page zooming is different from text resizing, as it resizes not only characters, but also multimedia objects and web page layout&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="EpiphanyAdBlock"&gt;Epiphany supports [[AdBlock]] as an official extension, in the [[epiphany-extensions]] package.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="FilterINI"&gt;Opera 9 introduced a content blocker for webpages ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209045028/http://labs.opera.com/news/2006/02/07/2/ |date=9 February 2006 }}). Earlier releases support [[Wildcard character|wildcard]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]]/domain/path and filetype blocking using a filter.ini file.

&lt;ref group="note" name="AdBlock"&gt;Most [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] browsers have options to block chosen images and cookies. Extended Ad filter support can be added by installing an extension such as [[Adblock Plus]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="AdSweep"&gt;Ad filter support can be added by installing an extension such as AdSweep, AdThwart or Adblock Plus.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref group="note" name="SafariPopupBlock"&gt;Does not allow selective blocking of pop-ups. Safari can only block all pop-ups, or none.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="SafariAdblocking"&gt;Ad filter support can be added by installing extensions.{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701200839/http://pimpmysafari.com/plugins/?c=Adblocking |date=1 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="IE6Tab"&gt;IE6 had no ''tabbed browsing'' support.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="IE6Popup"&gt;IE6 included pop-up blocking with Windows XP Service Pack 2 [http://www.microsoft.com/WindowsXP/using/web/sp2_popupblocker.mspx]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="iPhoneZoom"&gt;Page zooming supported in the iPhone version of Safari. Screen zooming is built into [[macOS]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="Spotlight"&gt;Full-text history search is available through [[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]], a feature of the macOS operating system.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="Mozilla Developer Network - Using tab-modal prompts"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_tab-modal_prompts |title=Mozilla Developer Network - Using tab-modal prompts |publisher=Developer.mozilla.org |date=3 February 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref group="note" name="ChromePopup"&gt;The option "Do not allow any site to show pop-ups" in Google Chrome, which is the default, actually allows sites to show pop-ups which are not considered harmful.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="text-modal-dialogs"&gt;Although text browsers don't have dialog windows, their prompts behave as modal dialogs – block the input until answer is received.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="external"&gt;This functionality is handled by third-party software by browser's design.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref group="note" name="MacCaret"&gt;On macOS systems, caret navigation (called "Full Keyboard Access") can be enabled systemwide.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="MacGestures"&gt;On [[Macintosh|Mac]] systems, gestures are available systemwide via multitouch sensing on trackpads and mice.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="MacSpeech"&gt;On macOS, text-to speech and speech recognition are available systemwide and is available from menu in native Cocoa browsers.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="ELinksSpatial"&gt;ELinks 0.12 supports spatial navigation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="EpiphanyGestures"&gt;Web supports mouse gestures as an extension from the [[Epiphany-extensions|official extensions package]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="KonqGestures"&gt;Mouse gesture support is available system-wide in [[KDE]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="KonqSpeech"&gt;Text-to speech support depends on the kttsd application in the kdeaccessibility package&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="IEGestures"&gt;Mouse gesture support is available via plug-ins, i.e. [http://www.ysgyfarnog.co.uk/utilities/mousegestures/ Mouse Gestures for Internet Explorer] or [http://www.browsertools.net/Easy-Go-Back/ Easy Go Back].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="Minimo"&gt;[[Doug Turner (Mozilla)|Doug Turner]], the [[Minimo]] lead developer, has introduced spatial navigation to some special Firefox builds {{cite web |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/007992.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050422043554/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/007992.html |archivedate=22 April 2005 |df=dmy-all }}. It may build as a default part of Firefox {{cite web |url=https://www.mozilla.org/access/keyboard/snav/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050422001621/http://www.mozilla.org/access/keyboard/snav/ |archivedate=22 April 2005 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="MozGestures"&gt;Mouse gesture support can be added by installing extensions like All-in-One Gestures (Firefox-only) [http://marc.boullet.pagesperso-orange.fr/ext/extensions-en.html] and Mouse Gestures [http://optimoz.mozdev.org/gestures/index.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="JAWS"&gt;Firefox works with a number of screen readers such as [[JAWS (screen reader)]] and [[Microsoft Speech API]] through extensions.{{which |date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="IE8Caret"&gt;[[Internet Explorer 8]] supports caret browsing.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="SAPITTS"&gt;[[Text-to-Speech|TTS]] in Internet Explorer is available through the operating system [[Speech Application Programming Interface|Speech API]]. For TTS, SAPI takes text as input and uses the TTS engine to output that text as spoken audio. This is the same technology used by the Windows accessibility tool, Narrator. SAPI and an English TTS engine have been embedded in all Windows operating systems since the release of Windows XP.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="WSR"&gt;Internet Explorer can be controlled by applications which use the operating system [[Speech Application Programming Interface|Speech API]]. A built-in application called [[Windows Speech Recognition]] ships with [[Windows Vista]] and later client versions.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="OperaCaret"&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101004015/http://my.opera.com/shoust/blog/show.dml/305626 |date=1 November 2006 |title=opera : a sort of caret navigation can be enabled by a button or a shortcut }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="ChromeGestures"&gt;Google Chrome can be given these features using extensions like smooth gestures, speechify and voice control for google chrome.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="QupGestures"&gt;Available as a Mouse Gestures plugin which is disabled by default, but it is part of default installation.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="QupBookm"&gt;Supports as of v1.7.0: https://github.com/QupZilla/qupzilla/issues/458&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acid scores==
{{relevance inline|date=September 2016}}
The [[Acid3|Acid]] tests are online test suites to determine aspects of standards compliance, to expose web page rendering flaws, and to rate the performance of browsers. Upon each test's release, they are designed so that no existing browser can pass without further development. In order for a browser to pass any Acid test, the '''latest public release''' of the browser (not an alpha, beta, release candidate, or other version under development or testing procedures) must meet the requirements shown below. In addition, the browser should be tested upon completion of installation, with no add-ons installed (some browsers make this easy by providing a "safe mode" option) and all the factory settings (no options have been changed from their defaults).

Acid1:
*Final rendering looks exactly like the rendering provided by the Acid tests website.
*Text can be highlighted and radio buttons can be selected.

Acid2:
*Final rendering looks exactly like the rendering provided by the Acid tests website.
*Smiley's nose turns blue when hovered over.

Acid3:
*Final rendering looks exactly like the rendering provided by the Acid tests website.
*Test does not report failed tests or abnormal delays (leftclick letter "A" to obtain a report)

==HTML5 support==
{{see also|Comparison of layout engines (HTML5)}}
The specifications for [[HTML5]] are still under development, but many current browsers already support many of the new features in the draft specifications. An HTML5 test suite is also under development that, while it does not test all of the new features nor the functionality of those it does detect, rates browsers' support. New tests are expected to be added to the suite as time goes by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Niels|first=Leenheer|title=The HTML5 test&amp;nbsp;— How well does your browser support HTML5?|url=https://html5test.com/|accessdate=24 August 2011|date=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As new tests are added, bogus ones removed, etc., new versions of [https://html5test.com/ html5test.com] become available as preliminary [https://beta.html5test.com/ beta] or even [https://alpha.html5test.com/ alpha] versions. These are great to test development versions (e.g. nightly builds) of web browsers, but their results should be taken with a grain of salt. Especially when considering that some browsers have experimental features built in which may be switched off by default.

==Web technology support==
Information about what web standards, and technologies the browsers support, except for JavaScript. External links lead to information about support in future versions of the browsers or extensions that provide such functionality.

&lt;ref group="note" name="CSS2"&gt;CSS 2, a [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] recommendation since 1998, is the current stable version of CSS, nevertheless, CSS 2.1 corrects a few errors in CSS2 (the most important being a new definition of the height/width of absolutely positioned elements, more influence for HTML's "style" attribute and a new calculation of the 'clip' property), and adds a few highly requested features which have already been widely implemented. CSS 2.1 is derived from and is intended to replace CSS 2. Conformance criteria are detailed [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html at the W3C website].&lt;!-- Are we following those criteria or not? We certainly should be. --&gt; (CSS 3 is only in draft status at present.) For more detailed information please see [[comparison of layout engines (CSS)]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="frames"&gt;Frames and frame sets are [http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/obsolete.html#non-conforming-features obsolete and non-conforming in HTML5]. They should not be used by authors.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="LINK"&gt;LINK as a navigational aid, as distinct from non-navigational uses of LINK.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="LINKext"&gt;Not in standard install, but provided by extension.[http://www.christophm.de/software/firefox/cmSiteNavigation/][http://webcoder.info/reference/LinkBars.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="XHTML"&gt;[[XHTML]] is based on [[HTML]] but is an application of XML, which means that XHTML must be stricter than equivalent HTML code. XHTML is meant to be read by an XML parser but for [[backward compatibility]] reasons can also be parsed as HTML; this table only notes the browsers that are able to parse XHTML as XML. For more detailed information please see [[comparison of layout engines (XHTML)]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="DilloFrames"&gt;[[Dillo]] displays frames as links that the user can click on.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="IEMathML"&gt;Available with the MathPlayer plugin.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="IEXForms"&gt;Available with the FormsPlayer plugin and several other plugins.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="XForms"&gt;XForms is supported experimentally in nightly builds dated after 28 January 2005 [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Web/XForms]. Requires installation of an extension.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="IEWF2"&gt;Web Forms 2.0 can be emulated in IE using DHTML behaviours, [https://sourceforge.net/projects/wf2/ available from SourceForge].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref group="note" name="ActiveX"&gt;Internet Explorer (and [[Internet Explorer shell|Shells]]) is the only browser to natively support the [[Component Object Model]] (popularly known as [[ActiveX]]). Most other browsers use the [[NPAPI]] plugin architecture. ActiveX is more powerful than NPAPI in terms of the control it affords over the browser, but it is specific to Windows whereas NPAPI is cross-platform. There is a third-party plugin that adds partial ActiveX support, that is available for certain older versions of Mozilla Suite, Mozilla Firefox and Netscape Navigator. The default settings in earlier versions of Internet Explorer allowed the automatic download, installation, and running of new ActiveX controls with minimal user intervention&amp;nbsp;– this made it possible to use ActiveX on web pages to install viruses, spyware, etc. onto a user's computer.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="Java"&gt;Java support is for built-in support by the browser without a plugin.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="CHR42"&gt;NPAPI and the Java-plugin were disabled by default in Chrome versions 42 and not supported in Chrome versions 45 and higher.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="IERSS"&gt;Internet Explorer 7 and later&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="aKregator"&gt;RSS and ATOM feed autodetection in Konqueror depends on the [[aKregator]] package which is installed with kdepim.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="epiphany-extensions"&gt;RSS and ATOM feed autodetection in Epiphany depends on the Newsfeed extension which is included with [[Epiphany-extensions]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="safarigears"&gt;Safari has Gears only on [[Mac OS X]] 10.4+. Windows is not supported&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="safarijava"&gt;Safari has Java only on macOS. Safari for Windows needs a plugin.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--IENPAPI is declared above because of nested ref tags--&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="IEhslice"&gt;Internet Explorer 8 supports syndicated content in &lt;code&gt;[[hAtom]]&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;hSlice&lt;/code&gt; microformat by the name of a feature known as [[Internet Explorer 8#Web Slices|Web Slices]]. Internet Explorer 4.0—7 supported [[Channel Definition Format|CDF]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref group="note" name="External2"&gt;Many browsers have FTP support as read-only and have no upload capitilies. Read-only is marked as yes. For a comparison of clients that support upload opportunities see [[Comparison of FTP client software]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="External3"&gt;Many browsers have purposely avoided support for e-mail and newsgroups ([[Usenet]]), as these are reserved for their mail-client counterparts. For a comparison of such counterparts see [[comparison of e-mail clients]] and [[Comparison of Usenet newsreaders]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref group="note" name="ChatZilla"&gt;IRC support can be added by installing [[ChatZilla]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="FirefoxGopherDropped"&gt;Firefox support for the Gopher protocol was dropped in Firefox 4 (Gecko 1.9.3) per [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=388195 bug 388195]. This and newer versions have full Gopher support when the OverbiteFF extension is installed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such program is called when user activates corresponding element, effectively allowing Lynx user to add support for arbitrary non-inlined file format.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="KONQJP2K"&gt;Konqueror supports JPEG2000 if KDE's viewer is compiled with Jasper library.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="IEXBM"&gt;Internet Explorer support for XBM files was removed in Version 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="IEPNG"&gt;Internet Explorer supports PNG images but is unable to correctly display images with [[gamma correction]] or [[color correction]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Versions of Internet Explorer prior to version 7 are unable to correctly display images with [[alpha compositing|alpha channel]] (for transparency) without additional coding [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms649487.aspx].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="MozMNG"&gt;Support of MNG/JNG was dropped since 6 June 2003 [https://www-archive.mozilla.org/status/2003-06-06.html] [http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=12633]. There are unofficial obsolete builds with MNG/JNG called Mngzilla [http://mngzilla.sourceforge.net/].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="NSMNG"&gt;Support for MNG/JNG has been dropped since 4 January 2014 [https://www.collabora.com/about-us/blog/2014/01/06/netsurf-developer-workshop-redux/] [http://git.netsurf-browser.org/netsurf.git/commit/?id=f7916866e3e4a81a2ba69d75b04ee6c45673429e].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="TIFF"&gt;Although it was one of the first suggested WWW image formats, most browsers support [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] by using a plugin installed by the user instead of decoding it natively.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="SVG"&gt;SVG here refers to SVG 1.1 Full. There are also two simplified profiles known as SVG 1.1 Tiny and SVG 1.1 Basic, which are intended for user agents with limited capabilities.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="FFSVG"&gt;Firefox and SeaMonkey partially support SVG 1.1 Full. Modules that are implemented or not implemented and details of their implementation: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SVG_in_Firefox].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="SVGT"&gt;Opera supports SVG 1.1 Basic.[http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/#graphics]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="WKJP2"&gt;Safari supports JPEG2000 through QuickTime plugin, which is an optional software bundle for Safari installation on Windows, and an integrated component in macOS.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="WKSVG"&gt;Safari 3 is able to render SVG documents, but not fully [http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20070612150045672].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="PDF"&gt;Most browsers support [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] by installing an [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] plugin which takes over the browser window. Listed here are browsers which also support inline PDFs within other [[hypertext]] documents (such as within HTML's &lt;img/&gt; tag). Note that PDF (in strictly speaking) is not an image format, but a scriptable rich text document format that can contain different types of multimedia content, including [[vector graphics|vector]] and [[raster graphics|bitmap]] graphics, audio, video, forms, intra- and inter-document hypertext links and a hierarchical contents listing. The format is also the native display format under macOS.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="KonqPDF"&gt;Inline PDF viewing in Konqueror requires KPDF which is included in kdegraphics.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="IECanvas"&gt;Support for the [[canvas element]] was added to Internet Explorer 9. Earlier versions of Internet Explorer can be made to emulate canvas using the [https://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/ excanvas] script.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="CairoPDF"&gt;With the addition of the new [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]] version in Gecko 1.9 it will be natively possible to save pages to PDFs but not read them. This feature is not included in Firefox 3.5, however it is possible with the new Cairo backend.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="ns7"&gt;Netscape 6.0, 6.01 and 7.0 included native support for MNG until the code was removed in 2003 due to code size and little actual usage.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="FFXBM"&gt;In [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] 1.9.2 (Firefox 3.6) XBM support was dropped.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="MozAPNG"&gt;Mozilla applications rebranded by the [[GNU]] project, such as [[GNU IceCat]] or [[Iceape]] do not support APNG.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="ChroAPNG"&gt;For Chromium prior to version 59 there is support via an extension.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="QupSVG"&gt;Falkon supports as much SVG specification as WebKit does: [http://www.webkit.org/projects/svg/status.xml].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="OperaAPNG"&gt;Opera is currently supporting APNG on their Beta and Dev builds.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="PaleMoonJPEGXR"&gt;Pale Moon supports JPEG-XR from the first quarter of 2017. [https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/Pale-Moon/issues/105]
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note" name="SafariHEIF"&gt;Safari support for HEIF pronounced in 2017 from version 11 on operating systems MAC Sierra and iOS 11. [https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-answers-iphone-storage-woes-with-smaller-photos-videos/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Virgil Riley Runnels Jr.''' (October 11, 1945 – June 11, 2015), better known as '''"The American Dream" Dusty Rhodes''', was an American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], booker, and trainer who most notably worked for the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], and the World Wrestling Federation, later known as the [[WWE]]. Following his retirement from wrestling, he made occasional on-air appearances on WWE television and pay-per-views and worked as a backstage [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booker]] and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Agent|producer]] in WWE's [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] developmental territory. Billed as "the son of a plumber", Rhodes did not have a typical wrestler's physique; his character was that of the "[[Working class|Common Man]]", known for the personality exhibited in his interviews. WWE chairman [[Vince McMahon]] remarked that no wrestler "personified the essence of charisma quite like Dusty Rhodes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|series=Celebrating the Dream|network=[[WWE Network]]|station=[[WWE]]|date=June 15, 2015|minutes=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhodes was a three-time [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]], and during his time in Jim Crockett Promotions, later known as [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], he was a [[WWE United States Championship|United States Heavyweight Champion]], and multi-time [[WCW Television Championship|World Television]], [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|World Tag Team]] and [[WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship|World Six-Man Tag Team Champion]]. He also won many regional championships, and is one of six men inducted into each of the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWE]], [[WCW Hall of Fame|WCW]], [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame|Professional Wrestling]], and ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' Halls of Fame. His sons, [[Goldust|Dustin]] and [[Cody Rhodes|Cody]], both pursued careers in professional wrestling and performed for WWE.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1967–1974) ===
After graduating from [[Arlington Heights High School]] in [[Fort Worth]], Rhodes played [[baseball]] and [[American football|football]] for [[West Texas A&amp;M Buffaloes football|West Texas State]] (now known as [[West Texas A&amp;M University]]). Turning professional, Rhodes tried out for the [[American Football League]]'s [[Boston Patriots]] but was cut.  He then played for the Hartford Charter Oaks in the [[Continental Football League]] until the team folded.&lt;ref name=austin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://podcastone.com/Steve-Austin-Show|title=The Steve Austin Show - Unleashed! EP66 - Dusty Rhodes - November 21st, 2013|work=podcastone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Rhodes saw an advertisement in the newspaper for Tony Santos’ [[professional wrestling]] promotion Big Time Wrestling, based in [[Boston]].  Rhodes drove to Boston, and despite not having any wrestling experience, bluffed his way into working for the company by using his real life friendships with [[Bobby Duncum Sr.|Bobby Duncum]] and the Funk brothers. Billed as Dusty Runnels,&lt;ref name=classics/&gt; one of his first matches was for the BTW World Heavyweight title against champion Frank Scarpa in the [[Boston Arena]]. Having little money, Rhodes slept in his car and spent [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] with [[Rufus R. Jones]] in a [[Boston]] [[soup kitchen]].&lt;ref name=austin/&gt;

Rhodes moved on to [[Fritz Von Erich]]'s Texas territory [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] in 1968, at that time also called Big Time Wrestling. It was in Texas where Rhodes first adopted the ring name "Dusty Rhodes".&lt;ref name=MAG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midatlanticgateway.com/p/career-results-dusty-rhodes_26.html|title=Career Results – Dusty Rhodes |work=midatlanticgateway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon meeting Rhodes, [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]] suggested that he change his [[ring name]] to "Lonesome Rhodes", a character [[Andy Griffith]] portrayed in the film ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]''. Rhodes reportedly replied: "Well...I don’t plan on being 'Lonesome'. I think I’ll stick with Dusty."&lt;ref name=hart1&gt;{{Cite book|title=My Life In Wrestling: With A Little Help From My Friends|last=Hart|first=Gary|publisher=GEAN Publishing|year=2009|isbn=0692000461|location=United States of America|pages=33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart took an immediate liking to Rhodes and convinced Von Erich of the young wrestler's potential. Rhodes became a rule-breaking [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] with Hart as his [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]], teaming with [[Don Jardine]], better known as The Spoiler.

Later in 1968, Rhodes left Texas and entered the [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Kansas City]] territory, tagging with fellow Texan [[Dick Murdoch]] to form the [[tag team]] '''The Texas Outlaws'''.&lt;ref name=MAG/&gt;&lt;ref name=hart1/&gt; The team traveled both nationally and internationally, appearing in Big Time Wrestling (Texas), NWA Western States Sports (Texas), NWA Detroit, [[National Wrestling Federation]] (NWF), [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]], [[World Championship Wrestling (Australia)]], [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Tri-State Wrestling]], the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), and [[International Wrestling Enterprise]] (Japan).&lt;ref name="WWEProfile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/dustyrhodes|title=Dusty Rhodes' bio|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MAG/&gt;&lt;ref name=headlocks73&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|author1=Assael, Shaun  |author2=Mike Mooneyham|publisher=Crown Publishers|year=2002|isbn=0609606905|pages=73–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=30em|align=left|quote=Rising to prominence in the era of steroids and bleached-blond hair, Rhodes was the rare top-end superstar who didn't possess the hulking, bodybuilder physique. In fact, Dusty's was quite the opposite, with his rotund belly and conspicuous red blotch on his right side.

This led him to break out as a solo wrestler, primarily in [[Florida]], referring to himself as the "American Dream", a [[working class]] hero, and aligning himself with Eddie Graham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2015/06/11/22447706.html|title=JJ Dillon's speech for Dusty Rhodes' induction into the Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=June 15, 2015|date=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Rhodes wrestled for [[Vince McMahon, Sr.]]'s [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF) on and off for lengthy periods of time until 1981. During that time, Rhodes main-evented twice in Madison Square Garden, both times challenging for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWWF Heavyweight Championship]] against reigning champion [[Superstar Billy Graham]].

=== Jim Crockett Promotions (1985–1989) ===
[[File:Dusty Rhodes Bionic Elbow.jpg|thumb|Rhodes battling [[Harley Race]] at an NWA event]]
He eventually began working as a [[Glossary of professional wrestling#Book|booker]] and wrestler with [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) in the Mid-Atlantic, which eventually purchased [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), formerly Georgia Championship Wrestling. Rhodes also teamed with [[Magnum T.A.]] as "America's Team", who opposed the [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] and [[The Russian Team]] in 1985. They were one of the more dominant tag teams in the promotion until 1986, when Magnum's career was ended in a car accident. Subsequently, he teamed with [[Nikita Koloff]] as [[The Super Powers]]. Rhodes was also a two time [[NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship|World Six-Man Tag Team Champion]] with [[The Road Warriors]].

Rhodes had [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]] with [[Abdullah the Butcher]], Pak Song, [[Terry Funk]], [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], [[Blackjack Mulligan]], Nikita Koloff, [[Harley Race]], Superstar Billy Graham, [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|"Crippler" Ray Stevens]] and, most notably, [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]] (especially [[Ric Flair]] and [[Tully Blanchard]]). Rhodes, Flair and Race fought each other many times over the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. Rhodes won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship three times; twice by defeating Race and once by defeating Flair.&lt;ref name="RollingStone"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/news/wrestling-icon-dusty-rhodes-dead-at-69-20150611|title=Dusty Rhodes, Wrestling Icon, Dead at 69|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 11, 2015|accessdate=June 12, 2015|author=Montgomery, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1985, during his feud with Flair, Rhodes gave an interview that became known as his "Hard Times" promo,&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/13060411/dusty-rhodes-connected-fans-no-other-pro-wrestling-superstar|title=Dusty Rhodes was unlike any other pro wrestling superstar|author=Campbell, Brian|date=June 12, 2015|accessdate=June 12, 2015|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguably his most popular [[Promos (professional wrestling)|promo]]: 
:''"First of all, I would to thank the many, many fans throughout this country that wrote cards and letters to Dusty Rhodes, The American Dream, while I was down. Secondly, I want to thank [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] for waitin’ and takin’ the time ‘cause I know how important it was, [[Starrcade (1985)|Starrcade '85]] it is to the wrestling fans, it is to Jim Crockett promotions, and Dusty Rhodes The American Dream. With that wait, I got what I wanted, [[Ric Flair]] the World's Heavyweight Champion. I don’t have to say a whole lot more about the way I feel about Ric Flair; no respect, no honor. There is no honor amongst thieves in the first place.''
:''He put hard times on Dusty Rhodes and his family. You don’t know what hard times are, daddy. Hard times are when the textile workers around this country are out of work, they got four or five kids and can’t pay their wages, can’t buy their food. Hard times are when the auto workers are out of work and they tell ‘em to go home. And hard times are when a man has worked at a job for thirty years, thirty years, and they give him a watch, kick him in the butt and say "hey a computer took your place, daddy", that's hard times! That's hard times! And Ric Flair you put hard times on this country by takin’ Dusty Rhodes out, that's hard times. And we all had hard times together, and I admit, I don’t look like the athlete of the day supposed to look. My belly's just a lil’ big, my heiny's a lil’ big, but brother, I am bad. And they know I’m bad.''
:''There were two bad people… One was [[John Wayne]] and he's dead brother, and the other's right here. Nature Boy Ric Flair, the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|World's Heavyweight title]] belongs to these people. I’mma reach out right now, I want you at home to know my hand is touchin’ your hand for the gathering of the biggest body of people in this country, in this universe, all over the world now, reachin’ out because the love that was given me and this time I will repay you now. Because I will be the next World's Heavyweight Champion of this hard time blues. Dusty Rhodes tour, ‘85.''
:''And Ric Flair, Nature Boy… Let me leave you with this. One way to hurt Ric Flair, is to take what he cherishes more than anything in the world and that's the World's Heavyweight title. I’m gon’ take it, I been there twice. This time when I take it daddy, I’m gon’ take it for you. Let's gather for it. Don’t let me down now, ‘cause I came back for you, for [[Jim Crockett|that man upstairs that died 10-12 years ago]] and never got the opportunity to see a real World's Champion. And I’m proud of you, thank God I have you, and I love you. Love ya!"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9py4aMK3aIU|title=Dusty Rhodes talks about "hard times": Mid-Atlantic Wrestling, Oct. 29, 1985|first=|last=WWE|date=April 9, 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Dusty-rhodes-hard-times-promo-annotated|title=Dusty Rhodes – Hard Times Promo|website=Genius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The promo—which references out-of-work steel workers, factory runners and other blue-collar individuals—apparently resonated with wrestling fans so much that people came to him in arenas in tears to thank him for "honoring their plight". In 2015, an ESPN article referred to "Hard Times" as Rhodes' best interview, writing, "In just over three minutes, Rhodes fully encapsulated every ounce of his charm by endearing himself to blue-collar mid-America".&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt;

During his stint as booker, JCP were engulfed in aggressive competition with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).&lt;ref name=headlocks73/&gt; When the WWF introduced [[Virgil (wrestler)|Mike Jones]] as [[Ted DiBiase]]'s bodyguard, [[Bobby Heenan]] suggested to name the character ''Virgil'' as an inside joke on Dusty's real name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man|page=156|author=DiBiase, Ted with Tom Caiazzo|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4165-5890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the late 1980s, Rhodes became synonymous with what would become known as the "[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#D|Dusty finish]]", a trick ending where a wrestler would win a match while the referee was knocked out, and the decision would be overturned.&lt;ref name=headlocks73/&gt;&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt;

Rhodes is often considered to be one of the most innovative and creative bookers in the history of professional wrestling. As previously mentioned, his work in the development of "supercards" and [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] matches did much to enhance the quality of entertainment and move the industry forward, as evident by other major promotions following with their own major cards and gimmicks. At the same time, however, he and JCP had an "old school" philosophy that did not bode well with the changes that were brought with fast moving media such as cable TV, etc. The long-standing [[Angle (professional wrestling)|storylines]] and the frequent use of the aforementioned "Dusty finish", techniques that had worked well during the NWA's territorial days, had now started to leave many fans dissatisfied with the promotion's booking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/the-art-dusty-finish-cm-punk-reference-wrestling-lore-wwe-night-champions-event/|title=CM Punk’s Nostalgia Reign and the Art of the Dusty Finish|first=David|last=Shoemaker|date=September 19, 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCSjVhDKbg|title=KICKSTARTER DUSTY FINISH/JIM CROCKETT DOCUMENTARY|first=|last=ellbowproduction|date=April 17, 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhodes was fired after [[Starrcade (1988)|Starrcade '88]], because of a taboo on-screen bloodletting (laid down by the [[Turner Broadcasting System]] following their purchase of the company) during a November 26 altercation with [[The Road Warriors]].&lt;ref name=spike&gt;{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap and Figure Four Weekly Present...The Death of WCW|last1=Reynolds|first1=R. D.|last2=Alvarez|first2=Bryan|pages=33–34|isbn=1-55022-661-4|publisher=ECW Press|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furious with the interference, Rhodes booked a storyline where [[Road Warrior Animal]] pulled a spike out of his shoulder pad and jammed it in Rhodes' eye, causing a severe laceration.&lt;ref name=spike/&gt; Rhodes was then fired from WCW.&lt;ref name=spike/&gt; Following this, Rhodes returned to Florida to compete in [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] (CWF), where he captured the PWF Heavyweight Championship and also returned to the AWA for a few appearances.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1989–1991) ===
In mid-1989, Rhodes came to the WWF as the yellow [[Polka dot|polka-dotted]] "[[Average Joe|Common Man]]" Dusty Rhodes, a gimmick some felt was intended to humiliate him due to his synonymy with the rival JCP/WCW.&lt;ref name="RollingStone"/&gt;&lt;ref name=headlocks103&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex, Lies, and Headlocks|author1=Assael, Shaun  |author2=Mike Mooneyham|publisher=Crown Publishers|year=2002|isbn=0609606905|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes was introduced to WWF audiences through a series of vignettes where he would gregariously and enthusiastically perform working class roles (including that of a [[plumber]], [[Butcher|butcher's]] [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]], [[Filling station attendant|gas station attendant]], and [[Pizza delivery|pizza delivery man]]), eventually being recognized by others at the end of the skit ("Hey! Aren't you...?"). He was managed by [[Juanita Wright|Sapphire]], who was intended to represent the "common woman".&lt;ref name=reflect&gt;{{cite book|title=Dusty: Reflections of an American Dream|last1=Rhodes|first1=Dusty|last2=Brody|first2=Howard|pages=127–128|year=2005|isbn=1-58261-907-7|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his early time in the WWF, Rhodes was embroiled in a heated storyline with "Macho King" [[Randy Savage]] and his manager/partner [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Queen Sherri]], who in turn found a rival in Sapphire. After a confrontation between the two couples, Savage's ex-manager [[Miss Elizabeth]] allied herself with Rhodes and Sapphire and was instrumental in helping them win the WWF's first mixed tag-team match during [[WrestleMania VI]]. Sapphire, however, left Rhodes during [[SummerSlam (1990)|SummerSlam]] for The Million Dollar Man's money. Afterwards, Rhodes dropped the polka dots and feuded with Dibiase and Virgil, which also resulted in the national debut of his son [[Goldust|Dustin]] at the [[Royal Rumble (1991)|1991 Royal Rumble]]. Both departed the WWF shortly after, marking the end of Rhodes' career as a full-time in-ring competitor.

=== Return to WCW and ECW (1991–2001) ===
Rhodes returned to WCW in 1991 as a member of WCW's booking committee, making his first appearance only 11 days after his last WWF appearance at the Royal Rumble.&lt;ref name=headlocks103/&gt; Booking disagreements between Rhodes and [[Ric Flair]] led to the latter's return to the WWF and [[Big Gold Belt#"Real" World Champion|the Big Gold Belt controversy]].&lt;ref name=headlocks103/&gt; Rhodes also served as the on-screen [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] of [[Ron Simmons]] from 1991 to 1992 and was in Simmons' corner on August 2, 1992 when he defeated [[Big Van Vader]] to win the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]]. He later joined the broadcast team, usually working with [[Tony Schiavone]] on ''[[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday Night]]''. He was paired with Schiavone and [[Bobby Heenan]] on pay-per-views.

Rhodes was originally on the side of WCW when its battle with the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) began in 1996. At [[Souled Out (1998)|Souled Out 1998]], [[Larry Zbyszko]] asked Rhodes, who was working the PPV broadcast, to accompany him to the ring for his match against [[Scott Hall]]. Zbyszko won the match by disqualification due to interference by [[Louie Spicolli]]. Rhodes entered the ring, delivering his trademark elbow smashes to Spicolli as Zbyszko stood and grabbed Hall. Rhodes went to elbow Hall, but seemingly inadvertently hit Zbyszko instead turning [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in the process. Hall then pointed to Rhodes as he revealed an nWo shirt.&lt;ref name=pwionline/&gt; The three began to drop repeated elbows on Zbyszko before Rhodes announced "That's tradition, WCW! Bite this!". Announcer Tony Schiavone left the broadcast booth in shock, but later returned [[Kayfabe|ripping]] Rhodes for his actions for most of the rest of the night. As a member of the nWo, Rhodes served as the manager of Hall [[The Outsiders (professional wrestling)|and]] [[Kevin Nash|Nash]]. This lasted until the November 30, 1998 episode of Monday Nitro, when Rhodes, who was guest refereeing a match between Barry Windham and [[Dean Malenko]] after being appointed by [[Eric Bischoff]], defected back to WCW by disqualifying Windham and awarding the match to Malenko.  Bischoff then fired Rhodes.

He left WCW in 2000 and went to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) where he put over former [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship|ECW World Champion]], "King of Old School" [[Steve Corino]].&lt;ref name="WWEProfile"/&gt; Rhodes returned once more to WCW, re-igniting his feud with [[Ric Flair]].

=== Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling and other promotions (2000–2003) ===
After both WCW and ECW were bought by WWE (WWF), Rhodes went to compete in his own promotion, [[Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling]] with ex-WCW and ECW superstars in the Georgia, Florida and Tennessee.

During this time he feuded with [[Terry Funk]] and Steve Corino in other territories.

In 2002, Rhodes competed in Pro Pain Pro Wreslting based in Philadelphia feuding with [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]]. This would lead to a Texas Bullrope match on November 23 in which Rhodes defeated Sullivan.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003–2005) ===
Rhodes began appearing with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) in 2003, returning to the ring to feud against the villainous [[Sports Entertainment Xtreme]] faction. on the January 15 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes, Road Warriors and Jeff Jarrett lost to [[Vince Russo]] and [[Triple X (professional wrestling)|Triple X]]. on the January 22 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes called out Nikita Koloff to reform the Superpowers, but Nikita turns on him. On the February 26 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes and [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] defeated [[Don and Ron Harris]] by disqualification. On the March 19 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes, Jeff Jarrett and D-Lo Brown defeated [[Erik Watts]], [[Brian Lawler]] and [[David Flair]] in a six-man tag team match a week later Rhodes defeated David Flair in a Bunkhouse match. On the April 9 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes defeated Brian Lawler in a [[Ladder match]]. On the August 13 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes and [[America's Most Wanted (professional wrestling)|America's Most Wanted]] defeated [[Disco Inferno (wrestler)|Glenn Gilbertti]] and [[Simon and Swinger|Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger]] the following week Rhodes lost a bullrope to Glen Gilbertti after Christopher Daniels interfered. On the October 1 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes and Jarrett defeated [[A.J. Styles]] and Russo. The following week Rhodes got a shot at the NWA title against Styles but lost when he passed out during the figure-4. On the October 15 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes and America's Most Wanted defeated Legend, Sonny Siaki and Ekmo Fatu. On the November 26 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes and Jarrett wrestled to a no contest in a Lumberjack Fan Strap match. After taking a few months off Rhodes returned on May 19, 2004 where he and [[James Storm]] defeated [[Lance Hoyt|Dallas]] and [[Kid Kash]] in a “Bunkhouse Brawl” this led to the duo getting a shot at the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] on June 2 but they failed to win the titles. On the June 4 episode of Impact, Rhodes gave an interview with Mike Tenay but got punked out by NWA champ Jeff Jarrett. On the July 14 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes, [[Larry Zbyszko]] and [[3Live Kru]] defeated Jarrett, [[Ken Shamrock]], [[Hernandez (wrestler)|Hernandez]], [[Chad Collyer]] and [[Kyle McNeely|Onyx]]. On the August 25 NWATNA PPV, Russo suspended Rhodes from TNA and banned him from the Asylum a few days later on the August 27 episode of Impact, Rhodes showed up in the front row, and got attacked by Scott D’Amore and ejected again. On the September 1 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes under a mask billed as Midnight Rider teamed with [[Konnan]] and [[Road Dogg|B.G. James]] to defeat [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]] ([[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]] and [[Bobby Roode]] and [[Johnny Devine]]). On the September 8 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes defeated [[Scott D'Amore]] with Russo as the special guest referee. On the October 29 episode of Impact, Rhodes started his campaign to replace Vince Russo as the Director of Authority. Later, he became the [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Directors of Authority|Director of Authority]] at their November 7, 2004 [[pay-per-view]], [[Victory Road (2004)|Victory Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2004/11/08/723409.html|author=Clevett, Jason|publisher=SLAM!

On the April 8, 2005 episode of Impact, Rhodes made the on-air decision to make all matches at Lockdown PPV in Six Sides of Steel. Then on the April 29 episode of Impact, Rhodes announced that MMA fighter [[Tito Ortiz]] will referee the World title match at [[Hard Justice (2005)]]. In May 2005, TNA President [[Dixie Carter (wrestling)|Dixie Carter]] asked Rhodes to move onto a creative team, which included [[Jeremy Borash]], Bill Banks, and [[Scott D'Amore]]. Rhodes resigned as booker, waiting out the rest of his contract with TNA, which expired soon after.

=== Independent circuit (2003–2006) ===
[[File:Dusty-kid XII.jpg|thumb|left|Rhodes facing [[Kid Kash]] in Ballpark Brawl]]

Rhodes made his first indy circuit appearance on April 12, 2003 for [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH), when he participated in the "I Quit Bunkhouse Riot" as a member of [[Homicide (wrestler)|Homicide]]'s team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ring of Honor|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/content/exclusive-ringside-content|title=Exclusive Ringside Content|date=November 8, 2012|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ring of Honor|url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/content/2003-ring-honor-results|title=2003 Ring of Honor Results|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 12, Rhodes defeated [[Jerry Lawler]] at an International Wrestling Cartel show that also featured [[Mick Foley]] as the special guest referee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2003 Results|publisher=International Wrestling Cartel|url=http://www.iwcwrestling.com/results/2003.html|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes returned to ROH on March 13, 2004, where he competed alongside [[The Carnage Crew]] in a Scramble Cage match against Special K, which the Carnage Crew won.&lt;ref name=OWOW/&gt;

On July 15, 2005, Rhodes participated in Ballpark Brawl IV in a victory over [[Kid Kash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2005/07/21/1141216.html|date=July 21, 2005|accessdate=June 12, 2015|title=Buffalo BallPark Brawl bats .400|publisher=Canadian Online Explorer|work=SLAM!

A few weeks before WWE's 2007 broadcast of [[The Great American Bash (2007)|The Great American Bash]], Rhodes returned to WWE television to feud with [[Randy Orton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/07022007/|title=A matter of time|date=July 2, 2007|last=Rote|first=Andrew|accessdate=December 31, 2007|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/07092007/|title=Bulldozed in the Bayou|date=July 9, 2007|last=DiFino|first=Lennie|accessdate=December 31, 2007|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/07162007/articles/rhodesangeratorton|title=Orton's audacity further fuels Rhodes’ anger|date=July 16, 2007|last=Clayton|first=Corey|accessdate=December 31, 2007|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; At The Great American Bash, Orton defeated Rhodes in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|Texas Bullrope match]] after hitting Rhodes with a cowbell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/thegreatamericanbash/history/2007/matches/42789822/results/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223043744/http://www.wwe.com/shows/thegreatamericanbash/history/2007/matches/42789822/results/|archivedate=February 23, 2009|title=A Great American Nightmare|date=July 22, 2007|last=Dee|first=Louie |accessdate=June 7, 2011|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following night on ''Raw'', after Orton defeated Rhodes' son Cody, Orton delivered a kick to Rhodes' head while he was trying to tend to his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/07232007/|title=One bad apple leads to Dominator destruction|date=July 23, 2007 |last=Clayton |first=Corey |accessdate=December 31, 2007|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 10, 2007, on the ''Raw'' [[Chris Benoit Memorial Show|15th Anniversary special episode]], Rhodes was at ringside to see Cody and [[Bob Holly|Hardcore Holly]] defeat [[Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch]] for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/12102007/|title=Rhodes and Holly golden on Raw's 15th Anniversary|last=Clayton|first=Corey|date=December 10, 2007|accessdate=December 31, 2007|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 2009, during the time Cody was part of [[The Legacy (professional wrestling)|The Legacy]] with Randy Orton and [[Ted DiBiase Jr.|Ted DiBiase]], Rhodes was the special guest host of ''Raw'' and booked a match between Cody and Orton for Orton's WWE Championship with [[John Cena]] as the special guest [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]]. It quickly turned out to be a ruse with Dusty's intention to allow Legacy to attack Cena, as well as [[D-Generation X]] ([[Triple H]] and [[Shawn Michaels]]) once they came to make the save. Despite the four standing tall together, Orton quickly gave an RKO to Rhodes, and though initially angered, Cody fell in line behind Orton.&lt;ref name="raw3108"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/08312009/mainarticle|title=American Nightmare|last=Sitterson|first=Aubrey|date=August 31, 2009|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2010, Rhodes wrestled the final match of his career at an [[Florida Championship Wrestling|FCW]] live event, where he teamed up with Cody and Goldust to defeat the team of [[Caylen Croft]], [[Curt Hawkins]], &amp; [[Trent Barreta]] in a 6-man tag team match.&lt;ref&gt;http://profightdb.com/cards/fcw/kissimmee-show-incomplete-card-25431.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhodes was the head writer and creative director for the weekly ''[[WWE NXT (TV series)|NXT Wrestling]]'' television broadcast. On September 12, 2013, he was removed as NXT Commissioner. Rhodes made his return to ''Raw'' on September 16, 2013 after accepting a "business proposition" from [[Stephanie McMahon]] in an attempt for WWE to rehire both his sons Cody and Dustin.  After learning that McMahon would only rehire one son of his choosing, Rhodes turned down the offer and was subsequently knocked out by [[Big Show]] on the orders of McMahon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Benigno, Anthony|date=September 16, 2013|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-09-16/wwe-raw-results-26148930/page-4|title=Raw results: While Dusty falls, Bryan rises above the corporate 'Game'|publisher=WWE|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes also appeared at [[Battleground (2013)|Battleground]] in the corner of Cody and Goldust as they took on [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]] ([[Seth Rollins]] and [[Roman Reigns]] with [[Dean Ambrose]] at ringside) in a tag team match.&lt;ref name=battle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2013/10/06/21176466.html|title=Battle may be over but WWE Battleground still leaves unresolved issues|author=Asher, Matthew|publisher=SLAM!

The Rhodes brothers won the match, thus reinstating them to the roster and allowing Dusty to retain his position in NXT. During the match, Dusty got into an altercation with Ambrose and performed the ''Bionic Elbow'' on him.

Rhodes appeared on the February 16, 2015 episode of ''Raw'', in an effort to reunite Goldust and Stardust, who were engaged in a conflict. Rhodes appeared at [[Fastlane (2015)|Fastlane]] on February 22, in a backstage segment with Goldust.

=== Illness and death ===
In his later years, Rhodes developed [[kidney failure]].&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2015/06/11/22447606.html|title="The American Dream" Dusty Rhodes dies|author=Oliver, Greg|publisher=SLAM!

On June 10, 2015, paramedics responded to Rhodes' home in [[Orlando, Florida]], after getting a call reporting that he had fallen. They drove him to a nearby hospital, where he died the next day. Rhodes was [[Cremation|cremated]] after his death, and his ashes were spread in November 2015 by his son Dustin on a ranch that Rhodes loved to visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/1130/604292/goldust-on-spreading-dusty-rhodes-ashes/|title=Goldust On Spreading Dusty Rhodes' Ashes, WWE Cyber Monday Sales, Xavier Woods Previews Game|publisher=Wrestling Inc.|first=Marc|last=Middleton|date=November 30, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Money in the Bank (2015)|2015 Money in the Bank]] pay-per-view event, a [[ten-bell salute]] was given in honor of Rhodes, with the entire WWE roster and the McMahon family on the entrance ramp. The next night on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', they honored him with a video tribute and a special after Raw on the [[WWE Network]]. At the ''[[WWE NXT (TV series)|NXT]]'' tapings following his death, he was honored with another ten-bell salute.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;This Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, while currently operating out of the same region of the United States and having revised some of the championships used by the original Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, is not the same promotion that was once owned by Jim Crockett Jr. and subsequently sold to Ted Turner in 1988. It is just another NWA-affiliated promotion.&lt;/small&gt;

'''European National Front''' was a coordinating structure of European ultranationalist parties. There had been one elected [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] from ENF in the past. He was the leader of the Italian [[New Force (Italy)|New Force]], [[Roberto Fiore]].
Three parties of the European National Front are today included at the [[Alliance for Peace and Freedom]].

==Structure==
The European National Front is headed by General Secretary, elected by ENF Assembly. The current General Secretary is [[Roberto Fiore]]. The Political Council is the founder's staff of the ENF. It safeguards the idea and principles of ENF. The Council can be increased by unanimous will of cooptation. It represents the Front outside, and confirms applications for ENF membership. The Members of the Council belong to ENF Assembly. The ENF Assembly defines the tactics and strategy of ENF. The Assembly consists of representatives of the movements belonging to ENF and members of Political Council. The Co-ordination Centre executes the current tasks of ENF. It gathers information and propaganda, and co-ordinates ENF activities.

Legal registered political parties/movements that accept the principles, aims and structure of ENF can apply for membership. The accession to ENF must be submitted by authorized representative of the applicant and then confirmed by Political Council. The representative of the Affiliated Group sits on the Assembly with advisory vote. The status of the Affiliated Group can be granted by Political Council.

The '''Extensible Provisioning Protocol''' ('''EPP''') is a flexible protocol designed for allocating objects within registries over the [[Internet]]. The motivation for the creation of EPP was to create a robust and flexible protocol that could provide communication between [[domain name registry|domain name registries]] and [[domain name registrar]]s. These transactions are required whenever a [[domain name]] is registered or renewed, thereby also preventing [[domain hijacking]]. Prior to its introduction, registries had no uniform approach, and many different proprietary interfaces existed. While its use for domain names was the initial driver, the protocol is designed to be usable for any kind of ordering and fulfilment system.

EPP is based on [[XML]] - a structured, text-based format. The underlying network transport is not fixed, although the only currently specified method is over [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]. The protocol has been designed with the flexibility to allow it to use other transports such as [[BEEP]], [[SMTP]], or [[SOAP]].

The first protocol drafts were published as [[IETF]] individual submission [[Internet-Draft]] documents by Scott Hollenbeck of [[Verisign]] in November 2000:
* [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hollenbeck-epp-00 Extensible Provisioning Protocol]
* [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hollenbeck-epp-contact-00 Extensible Provisioning Protocol Contact Mapping]
* [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hollenbeck-epp-domain-00 Extensible Provisioning Protocol Domain Name Mapping]
* [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hollenbeck-epp-host-00 Extensible Provisioning Protocol Host Mapping]
* [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hollenbeck-epp-tcp-00 Extensible Provisioning Protocol Transport Over TCP]

The individual submission documents were adopted by the [[IETF]] ''Provisioning Registry'' (''provreg'') [[working group]], which was created after a [[Birds of a feather (computing)|BoF]] session was held at [http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/49/00dec-36.htm#P5400_260270 IETF-49] in December 2000. Proposed Standard documents (RFCs 3730 - 3734) were published by the [[RFC Editor]] in March 2004. Draft Standard documents (RFCs 4930 - 4934) were published in May 2007. In August 2009 IETF granted EPP the status of full standard, [http://www.rfc-editor.org/std/std69.txt STD 69].

==Adoption==
The protocol has been adopted by a number of domain name registries, such as: [[.ac]], [[.aero]], [[.ag]], [[.ai]], [[.asia]], [[.ar]], [[.at]], [[.au]], [[.be]], [[.biz]], [[.br]], [[.bz]], [[.ca]], [[.cat]], [[.cc]], [[.ch]], [[.cl]], [[.cn]], [[.co]], [[.cr]], [[.cz]], [[.com]], [[.coop]], [[.cx]], [[.cz]], [[.dk]], [[.ee]], [[.es]] (over HTTPS), [[.eu]], [[.fi]], [[.fm]], [[.fr]], [[.gr]] (over HTTPS), [[.gs]], [[.hn]], [[.ht]], [[.im]], [[.in]], [[.info]], [[.io]], [[.it]] (over HTTPS), [[.jobs]], [[.ke]], [[.ki]], [[.kz]], [[.la]], [[.lc]], [[.li]], [[.lt]], [[.lu]], [[.lv]], [[.md]], [[.me]], [[.mk]], [[.mn]], [[.mobi]], [[.ms]], [[.mu]], [[.mx]], [[.na]], [[.name]], [[.net]], [[.nf]], [[.ng]], [[.nl]], [[.no]], [[.nu]], [[.nz]] (EPP codes referred to as [[Unique_Domain_Authentication_Identifier|UDAIs]]), [[.org]], [[.pe]], [[.pk]], [[.pl]] (over HTTPS), [[.pro]], [[.ps]], [[.pt]], [[.ru]], [[.ro]], [[.sc]], [[.se]], [[.sh]], [[.si]], [[.su]], [[.tel]], [[.tl]], [[.tm]], [[.travel]], [[.tv]], [[.tw]], [[.ua]], [[.uk]], [[.us]], [[.vc]], [[.ve]] and [[.za]] as well as [[ENUM]] registries such as those operating the [http://www.enum.nl/ +31], +41, +43, +44 and +48 country codes.

[[Transfer secret|EPP authInfo "codes" or "keys"]] are also required in the transfer of generic top-level domain names between registrars ([[.com]], [[.net]], [[.org]], [[.biz]], [[.info]]).

.com and .net domain names only began requiring the EPP key from fourth quarter 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10919">'''Frederick A. de Armas''' is a literary scholar, critic and novelist who is currently [[Andrew W. Mellon]] Distinguished Service Professor in Humanities at the [[University of Chicago]].

==Biography==
Frederick A. de Armas was born in Havana, Cuba on February 9, 1945. He attended elementary school at La Salle and when his parents moved to France, he went to boarding school at [[Le Rosey]] in Switzerland. After his family lost their possessions as a result of the [[Cuban Revolution]], he moved to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;See his autobiography included in a volume entitled ''¿Por qué España?  Memorias del hispanismo estadounidense'', eds. Anna Caballe Masrorroll and Randolph D. Pope. Barcelona: Galaxia Gutenberg, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; De Armas holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (1969), and has taught at [[Louisiana State University]] (1969–1988), [[Pennsylvania State University]] (where he was [[Edwin Erle Sparks]] Professor of Spanish and Comparative Literature) (1988–2000) and has been a visiting professor at [[Duke University]] (1994). Since 2000 he has been at the [[University of Chicago]] where he is [[Andrew W. Mellon]] Distinguished Service Professor in the Departments of Romance Languages and Literatures and Comparative Literature. He has served as Chair of Romance Languages and Literatures (2006–2009; 2010–2012). In addition he has been Vice President and President of the Cervantes Society of America (2003–2009); and President of AISO Asociacion Internacional Siglo de Oro (2015-2017).

==Career==
De Armas' publications focus on early modern Spanish literature and culture, often from a comparative perspective. His interests include the politics of astrology, magic and the Hermetic tradition, [[ekphrasis]], verbal and visual culture, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Carrie L. Ruiz, "Oscillating trends: A Reflection of the Status of Seventeenth-Century Studies Today: Interview of Frederick A. de Armas" ''Transitions. Journal of Franco-Iberian Studies'' 5 (2009), pp. 9-25&lt;/ref&gt; His early books evince an interest in the relationship between mythology and literature, between the classics and [[Spanish Golden Age]] works. They include: ''The Invisible Mistress: Aspects of Feminism and Fantasy in the Golden Age'' (1976), which contains some of the earliest discussions of proto-feminism in early modern Spain,&lt;ref&gt;''The Perception of Women in Spanish Theater of the Golden Age''. Ed. Anita K. Stoll and Dawn L. Smith. Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1991, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Return of Astraea: An Astral-Imperial Myth in Calderón'' (1986), which is one of the first studies that approach Calderón from a historicist perspective and is also deeply influenced by the writings of the [[Warburg Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Santiago Fernández Mosquera, "El significado de las primeras fiestas cortesanas de Calderón," ''Calderón y el pensamiento ideológico y cultural de su época: XIV Coloquio Anglogermano sobre Calderón'', eds., Manfred Tietz y Gero Arnscheidt, Stuttgart, Steiner, 2008, p.224.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he interprets the figure of Circe in one of Calderon's plays as critiquing the policies of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]'s minister, the Count-Duke of Olivares.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Rich Greer, ''The Play of Power. Mythological Court Dramas of Calderón de la Barca.''Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991, pp. 88ff.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] is in many cases a figure that serves to praise the regime. His interest in Golden Age Theater has led him to publish several book collections: ''The Prince in the Tower: Perceptions of "La vida es sueño"'' (1993), ''Heavenly Bodies: The Realms of "La estrella de Sevilla"'' (1996) and ''A Star-Crossed Golden Age: Myth and the Spanish Comedia'' (1998).

One of his main interests throughout his career has been the relationship between the verbal and the visual in early modern Spanish literature and Italian art. In recent years, this subject has become central to his research, as evinced by the book, ''Cervantes, Raphael and the Classics'' (Cambridge, 1998).  This study focuses on [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes’]] most famous tragedy, ''[[The Siege of Numantia|La Numancia]]'', showing how it is engaged in a conversation with classical authors of Greece and Rome, especially through the interpretations of antiquity presented by the artist [[Raphael]]. This book was followed by the collections ''Writing for the Eyes in the Spanish Golden Age'' (2004) and ''Ekphrasis in the Age of Cervantes'' (2005). In the introduction to this last collection he establishes a typology of [[ekphrasis]], including definitions for allusive, collectionist, descriptive, dramatic, interpolated, narrative, shaping, and veiled ekphrasis, as well as meta-ekphrasis and ur-ekphrasis. He applies these terms in his book: ''Quixotic Frescoes. Cervantes and Italian Art'' (Toronto, 2006).

After his book on Cervantes and Italian art, he co-edited two collections on Spanish Golden Age theater. The first one, on tragedy, is entitled ''Hacia la tragedia: Lecturas para un nuevo milenio'' (Madrid, 2008); and the second one, on a specific writer is called ''Calderón: del manuscrito a la escena'' (2011). At the same time, he continues to work on Cervantes, having published an edited volume, ''Ovid in the Age of Cervantes'' (2010). His latest book, ''Don Quixote among the Saracens: Clashes of Civilizations and Literary Genres'' (2011) has received the American Publishers' Association PROSE Award in Literature, Honorable Mention (2011). The book has a double focus. The first has to do with a [[clash of civilizations]] and asks: Why is [[Don Quixote]] at peace among the Saracens? The second has to do with Don Quixote as an "imperial" vehicle for the assimilation or destruction of literary genres.

Starting around 2008 De Armas became increasingly interested in the cultural and literary productions of the maternal side of his family, publishing essays on  Ana Galdós, Domingo A. Galdós and [[Benito Pérez Galdós]]. He has also started to publish fiction while continuing to work on the literature and culture of early modern Spain. His novel, ''El abra del Yumuri'', takes place in Cuba during the last three months of 1958, just before the fall of [[Fulgencio Batista]] and the triumph of the [[Cuban Revolution]]. It focuses on the lives of five women, most of them from the upper bourgeoisie, and how they deal with political and social upheaval, as well as the dangers of a serial killer that preys on women of means. For some critics, the novel combines two very different trends: that of the social novel inspired by [[Benito Pérez Galdós]], and that of [[magic realism]] embodied by [[Alejo Carpentier]]. &lt;ref&gt; Jose María Pozuelo Yvancos, "El abra del Yumuri: La Habana antes del fin," ''ABC Cultural'', enero 2017.  http://www.abc.es/cultura/cultural/abci-abra-yumuri-habana-antes-201701130220_noticia.html &lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gadus''''' is a genus of [[demersal fish]] in the family [[Gadidae]], commonly known as [[cod]], although there are additional cod species in other [[genus|genera]]. The best known member of the genus is the [[Atlantic cod]].

Until recently, three species in the genus were recognized. Modern taxonomy also includes a fourth one, the [[Alaska pollock]] (''Gadus'' (=''Theragra'') ''chalcogrammus''), which is not separate from the [[Theragra finnmarchica|Norway pollock]].&lt;ref&gt;Eschmeyer W.F.

Amphitryon's own, mortal son was [[Iphicles]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was a great-grandson and half-brother (as they are both sired by the god [[Zeus]]) of [[Perseus]]. He was the greatest of the Greek heroes, a paragon of masculinity, the ancestor of royal clans who claimed to be [[Heracleidae]] ({{lang|grc|Ἡρακλεῖδαι}}), and a champion of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian order]] against [[chthonic]] monsters. In [[Roman mythology|Rome]] and the [[modernity|modern]] [[western world|West]], he is known as '''[[Hercules]]''', with whom the later [[Roman emperor]]s, in particular [[Commodus]] and [[Maximian]], often identified themselves. The Romans adopted the Greek version of his life and works essentially unchanged, but added anecdotal detail of their own, some of it linking the hero with the geography of the Central Mediterranean. Details of his [[cult (religion)|cult]] were adapted to Rome as well.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Origin==

Many popular stories were told of his life, the most famous being [[Labours of Hercules|The Twelve Labours of Heracles]]; [[Alexandria]]n poets of the [[Hellenistic age]] drew his mythology into a high poetic and tragic atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Burkert"&gt;Burkert 1985, pp. 208–9&lt;/ref&gt; His figure, which initially drew on Near Eastern motifs such as the lion-fight, was widely known.

Heracles was the greatest of Hellenic [[chthonic]] heroes, but unlike other Greek heroes, no tomb was identified as his. Heracles was both hero and god, as [[Pindar]] says ''heroes theos''; at the same festival sacrifice was made to him, first as a hero, with a chthonic [[libation]], and then as a god, upon an altar: thus he embodies the closest Greek approach to a "[[demi-god]]".&lt;ref name="Burkert" /&gt; The core of the story of Heracles has been identified by [[Walter Burkert]] as originating in Neolithic hunter culture and traditions of [[shaman]]istic crossings into the netherworld.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985, pp. 208–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hero or god===
Heracles' role as a culture hero, whose death could be a subject of mythic telling (see below), was accepted into the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian Pantheon]] during Classical times. This created an awkwardness in the encounter with [[Odysseus]] in the episode of ''[[Odyssey]]'' XI, called the [[Nekuia]], where Odysseus encounters Heracles in [[Hades]]:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;And next I caught a glimpse of powerful Heracles—
His ghost I mean: the man himself delights
in the grand feasts of the deathless gods on high...
Around him cries of the dead rang out like cries of birds
scattering left and right in horror as on he came like night...&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Fagles]]' translation, 1996:269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Ancient critics were aware of the problem of the aside that interrupts the vivid and complete description, in which Heracles recognizes Odysseus and hails him, and modern critics find very good reasons for denying that the verses beginning, in Fagles' translation ''His ghost I mean...'' were part of the original composition: "once people knew of Heracles' admission to Olympus, they would not tolerate his presence in the underworld", remarks [[Friedrich Solmsen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Friedrich |last=Solmsen |title=The Sacrifice of Agamemnon's Daughter in Hesiod's' Ehoeae |journal=[[The American Journal of Philology]] |volume=102 |issue=4 |year=1981 |pages=353–358 [p. 355] |jstor=294322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that the interpolated verses represent a compromise between conflicting representations of Heracles.

===Christian chronology===
In Christian circles a [[Euhemerism|Euhemerist]] reading of the widespread Heracles cult was attributed to a historical figure who had been offered cult status after his death. Thus [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], ''[[Preparation of the Gospel]]'' (10.12), reported that [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]] could offer historical dates for Hercules as a king in Argos: "from the reign of Hercules in [[Argos]] to the [[wikt:deification|deification]] of Hercules himself and of [[Asclepius]] there are comprised thirty-eight years, according to [[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]] the chronicler: and from that point to the deification of [[Castor and Pollux]] fifty-three years: and somewhere about this time was the capture of [[Troy]]."

[[File:Agrigent Heraklestempel.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Temple of Heracles, Agrigento|Temple to Heracles]] in [[Agrigento]], [[Sicily]], Italy]]

Readers with a literalist bent, following Clement's reasoning, have asserted from this remark that, since Heracles ruled over [[Tiryns]] in Argos at the same time that [[Eurystheus]] ruled over [[Mycenae]], and since at about this time [[Linus (mythology)|Linus]] was Heracles' teacher, one can conclude, based on [[Jerome]]'s date—in his [[universal history]], his ''Chronicon''—given to Linus' notoriety in teaching Heracles in 1264 BCE, that Heracles' death and deification occurred 38 years later, in approximately 1226 BCE.

===Cult===
The ancient Greeks celebrated the festival of the ''[[Heracleia (festival)|Heracleia]]'', which commemorated the death of Heracles, on the second day of the month of [[Metageitnion]] (which would fall in late July or early August). What is believed to be an [[Egypt]]ian Temple of Heracles in the [[Bahariya Oasis]] dates to 21 BCE. A reassessment of [[Ptolemy]]'s descriptions of the island of [[Malta]] attempted to link the site at [[Ras ir-Raħeb]] with a temple to Heracles,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ptolemy|Ptol.]] iv. 3. § 37&lt;/ref&gt; but the arguments are not conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ventura|first=F.|title=Ptolemy's Maltese Co-ordinates|journal=Hyphen|date=1988|volume=V|issue=6|pages=253–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several ancient cities were named [[Heraclea (disambiguation)|Heraclea]] in his honor.

Although the Athenians were among the first to worship Heracles as a god, there were Greek cities that refused to recognize the hero's divine status. There are also several polis that merely provided two separate sanctuaries for Heracles, one recognizing him as a god, the other only as a hero.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The "Sacred History" of Euhemerus of Messene|last=Winiarczyk|first=Marek|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2013|isbn=9783110278880|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ambiguity helped create the Heracles cult especially when historians (e.g. Herodotus) and artists encouraged worship such as the painters during the time of the [[Peisistratos]], who often presented Heracles entering Olympus in their works.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Some sources explained that the cult of Heracles persisted because of the hero's ascent to heaven and his suffering, which became the basis for festivals, ritual, rites, and the organization of mysteries.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Mystery Cults|last=Burkert|first=Walter|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0674033870|location=Cambridge|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is the observation, for example, that sufferings (''pathea'') gave rise to the rituals of grief and mourning, which came before the joy in the mysteries in the sequence of cult rituals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also, like the case of Apollo, the cult of Hercules has been sustained through the years by absorbing local cult figures such as those who share the same nature.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization|last=Hornblower|first=Simon|last2=Spawforth|first2=Antony|last3=Eidinow|first3=Esther|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780198706779|location=Oxford|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also constantly invoked as a patron for men, especially the young ones. For example, he was considered the ideal in warfare so he presided over gymnasiums and the ''ephebes'' or those men undergoing military training.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There were ancient towns and cities that also adopted Heracles as a patron deity, contributing to the spread of his cult. There was the case of the royal house of Macedonia, which claimed lineal descent from the hero&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=King and Court in Ancient Macedonia: Rivalry, Treason and Conspiracy|last=Carney|first=Elizabeth|publisher=The Classical Press of Wales|year=2015|isbn=9781910589083|location=Swansea|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily for purposes of divine protection and legitimator of actions.

The earliest evidence that show the worship of Heracles in popular cult was in 6th century BC (121–122 and 160–165) via an ancient inscription from Phaleron.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   

==Character==

This vase at [[Caere]] shows [[King Eurytus of Oechalia]] and Heracles in a symposium. Krater of corinthian columns called 'Krater of Eurytion', circa 600 B.C.]]

Extraordinary strength, [[courage]], ingenuity, and sexual prowess with both males and females were among the characteristics commonly attributed to him. Heracles used his wits on several occasions when his strength did not suffice, such as when laboring for the king [[Augeas]] of [[Elis]], wrestling the giant [[Antaeus]], or tricking [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] into taking the sky back onto his shoulders. Together with [[Hermes]] he was the patron and protector of [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasia]] and [[palaestra]]e.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Guide to Greece'', 4.32.1&lt;/ref&gt; His iconographic attributes are the [[Nemean Lion|lion skin]] and the [[Club (weapon)|club]]. These qualities did not prevent him from being regarded as a playful figure who used games to relax from his labors and played a great deal with children.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', 12.15&lt;/ref&gt; By conquering dangerous archaic forces he is said to have "made the world safe for mankind" and to be its benefactor.&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', 5.3&lt;/ref&gt; Heracles was an extremely passionate and emotional individual, capable of doing both great deeds for his friends (such as wrestling with [[Thanatos]] on behalf of Prince [[Admetus]], who had regaled Heracles with his hospitality, or restoring his friend [[Tyndareus]] to the throne of [[Sparta]] after he was overthrown) and being a terrible enemy who would wreak horrible vengeance on those who crossed him, as Augeas, [[Neleus]] and [[Laomedon]] all found out to their cost. There was also a coldness to his character, which was demonstrated by Sophocles' depiction of the hero in ''[[Women of Trachis|The Trachiniae]]''. Heracles threatened his marriage with his desire to bring two women under the same roof, one of them was his wife [[Deianira|Deianeira]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Facts on File Companion to Classical Drama|last=Thorburn|first=John|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|year=2005|isbn=978-0816052028|location=New York|pages=555}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the works of [[Euripides]] involving Heracles, an insight was presented regarding his character and this was through his madness. The idea was that his actions were partly driven by forces outside rational human control and that by highlighting the divine causation of his madness, it becomes a device that problematizes Heracles' character and status within the civilized context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heracles and Euripidean Tragedy|last=Papadopoulou|first=Thalia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780521851268|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect is also highlighted in ''[[Hercules (Seneca)|Hercules Furens]]'' where [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] linked the hero's madness to an illusion and a consequence of Herakles' refusal to live a simple life offered by [[Amphitryon]]. It was indicated that he preferred the extravagant violence of the heroic life and that its ghosts eventually manifested in his madness and that the hallucinatory visions defined Herakles' character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Self-representation and Illusion in Senecan Tragedy|last=Littlewood|first=Cedric|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0199267613|location=Oxford|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==

===Birth and childhood===

[[File:Herakles strangling snakes Louvre G192.jpg|thumb|Heracles strangling [[snake]]s (detail from an Attic red-figured stamnos, c. 480–470 BCE)]]

A major factor in the well-known tragedies surrounding Heracles is the hatred that the [[goddess]] [[Hera]], wife of [[Zeus]], had for him. A full account of Heracles must render it clear why Heracles was so tormented by Hera, when there were many illegitimate offspring sired by Zeus. Heracles was the son of the affair Zeus had with the mortal woman [[Alcmene]]. Zeus made love to her after disguising himself as her husband, [[Amphitryon]], home early from war (Amphitryon did return later the same night, and Alcmene became pregnant with his son at the same time, a case of heteropaternal [[superfecundation]], where a woman carries twins sired by different fathers).&lt;ref&gt;Compare the two pairs of twins born to [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] and the "double" parentage of [[Theseus]].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Heracles' very existence proved at least one of Zeus' many illicit affairs, and Hera often conspired against Zeus' mortal offspring as revenge for her husband's infidelities. His twin mortal brother, son of Amphitryon, was [[Iphicles]], father of Heracles' charioteer [[Iolaus]].

[[File:Jacopo Tintoretto - The Origin of the Milky Way - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''The Origin of the Milky Way'' by [[Jacopo Tintoretto]]]]

On the night the twins Heracles and Iphicles were to be born, Hera, knowing of her husband Zeus' adultery, persuaded Zeus to swear an oath that the child born that night to a member of the House of [[Perseus]] would become High King. Hera did this knowing that while Heracles was to be born a descendant of Perseus, so too was [[Eurystheus]]. Once the oath was sworn, Hera hurried to Alcmene's dwelling and slowed the birth of the twins Heracles and Iphicles by forcing [[Ilithyia]], goddess of childbirth, to sit crosslegged with her clothing tied in knots, thereby causing the twins to be trapped in the womb. Meanwhile, Hera caused Eurystheus to be born prematurely, making him High King in place of Heracles. She would have permanently delayed Heracles' birth had she not been fooled by [[Galanthis]], Alcmene's servant, who lied to Ilithyia, saying that [[Alcmene]] had already delivered the baby. Upon hearing this, she jumped in surprise, loosing the knots and inadvertently allowing Alcmene to give birth to Heracles and Iphicles.

Fear of Hera's revenge led Alcmene to expose the infant Heracles, but he was taken up and brought to Hera by his half-sister [[Athena]], who played an important role as protectress of heroes.  Hera did not recognize Heracles and nursed him out of pity. Heracles suckled so strongly that he caused Hera pain, and she pushed him away. Her milk sprayed across the heavens and there formed the Milky Way. But with divine milk, Heracles had acquired supernatural powers.  Athena brought the infant back to his mother, and he was subsequently raised by his parents.

The child was originally given the name Alcides by his parents; it was only later that he became known as Heracles.&lt;ref name="Alcides" /&gt; He was renamed Heracles in an unsuccessful attempt to mollify Hera.  He and his twin were just eight months old when Hera sent two giant snakes into the children's chamber.  Iphicles cried from fear, but his brother grabbed a snake in each hand and strangled them.  He was found by his nurse playing with them on his cot as if they were toys.  Astonished, Amphitryon sent for the seer [[Tiresias]], who prophesied an unusual future for the boy, saying he would vanquish numerous monsters.

===Youth&lt;!--Linked from 'The Choice of Hercules'--&gt;===
[[File:CarracciHercules.jpg|thumb|[[The choice of Hercules]] by [[Annibale Carracci]]]]
After killing his music tutor [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]] with a [[lyre]], he was sent to tend cattle on a mountain by his foster father Amphitryon. Here, according to an allegorical [[parable]], "The Choice of Heracles", invented by the sophist [[Prodicus]] (c. 400 BCE) and reported in [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'' 2.1.21–34, he was visited by two allegorical figures—Vice and Virtue—who offered him a choice between a pleasant and easy life or a severe but glorious life: he chose the latter. This was part of a pattern of "ethicizing" Heracles over the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Ford, ''Aristotle as Poet'', Oxford, 2011, p. 208 n. 5, citing, in addition to Prodicus/Xenophon, [[Antisthenes]], [[Herodorus]] (esp. [[FGrHist]] 31 F 14), and (in the 4th century) [[Plato]]'s use of "Heracles as a figure for Socrates' life (and death?): ''Apology'' 22a, cf. ''Theaetetus'' 175a, ''Lysis'' 205c."&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], Heracles married King [[Creon]]'s daughter, [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]]. In a fit of madness, induced by Hera, Heracles killed his children by Megara. After his madness had been cured with [[hellebore]] by Antikyreus, the founder of [[Anticyra|Antikyra]],&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias Χ 3.1, 36.5. [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaeus]], ''[[Geography|Geogr. Hyph.]]'' ΙΙ 184. 12. Stephanus of Byzantium, s.v. "Ἀντίκυρα"&lt;/ref&gt; he realized what he had done and fled to the [[Delphi|Oracle of Delphi]]. Unbeknownst to him, the Oracle was guided by Hera. He was directed to serve King [[Eurystheus]] for ten years and perform any task Eurystheus required of him.  Eurystheus decided to give Heracles ten labours, but after completing them, Heracles was cheated by Eurystheus when he added two more, resulting in the Twelve Labors of Heracles.

===Labours of Heracles===

[[File:Herakles lion Louvre F33.jpg|thumb|The fight of Heracles and the [[Nemean lion]] is one of his most famous feats. (Side B from a black-figure Attic amphora, c. 540 BCE)]]

[[File:Hercules Musei Capitolini MC1265 n2.jpg|thumb|225px|upright|His eleventh feat was to capture the apple of [[Hesperides]] (Gilded bronze, Roman artwork, 2nd century CE)]]

{{Main article|Labours of Hercules}}
Driven mad by Hera, Heracles slew his own children. To expiate the crime, Heracles was required to carry out ten labours set by his archenemy, [[Eurystheus]], who had become king in Heracles' place. If he succeeded, he would be purified of his sin and, as myth says, he would become a god, and be granted immortality. 

Despite the difficulty, Heracles accomplished these tasks, but Eurystheus in the end did not accept the success the hero had with two of the labours. The cleansing of the Augean stables, because Heracles was going to accept pay for the labour. Neither did he accept the killing of the Lernaean Hydra as Heracles' brother, [[Iolaus]], had helped him burn the stumps of the multiplying heads. 

Eurystheus set two more tasks, fetching the Golden Apples of Hesperides and capturing [[Cerberus]]). In the end, with ease, the hero successfully performed each added task, bringing the total number of labours up to the magic number '''''twelve'''''.

Not all versions and writers give the labours in the same order. The ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' (2.5.1–2.5.12) gives the following order:

1. Slay the [[Nemean lion|Nemean Lion]].

     He defeated a lion with his bare hands that was attacking the city ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemea Nemea]). After he succeeded he wore the fur as a cloak to show his power of strength in his opponent he defeated.     

2. Slay the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]].

     A fire-breathing monster with a lion’s head and a body of many snakes which laid in a swamp near [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerna Lerna]. Hera sent it in the hopes it would destory Heracles home city because she thought it was too unbeatable. With help from a friend, also his brohter, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iolaus Iolaus], they defeated the beast and dipped his arrows in the poisoned blood of the monster.

3. Capture the [[Ceryneian Hind|Golden Hind of Artemis]].

     Not to kill, but to catch, this monster. A different, but still difficult task for a hero. It took a toll on time but not on our hero. Her wore out the Hind and Heracles presented it alive to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurystheus Eurystheus].

4. Capture the [[Erymanthian Boar]].

     A plagued boar on the loose and who else but Heracles, should be in charge of catching it, and bringing it to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenae Mycenae]. Again, a timely task, but tiresome the hero made the beast, captured it, and brought it to its final spot. Patience is ket in the last two labours. 

5. Clean the [[Augeas|Augean]] stables in a single day.

     A herd with poisoned poop. Augeias was given to him by his gather [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios Helios]. Heracles was given the near impossible task of cleaning the stables of the diseased feces. He accomplished it with ease, by digging holes on either side of the stables, moved it into the holes, and then asking [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfeios rivers Alpheios] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineios_(Thessaly) Peneios] to wash the ditches clean.

6. Slay the [[Stymphalian birds|Stymphalian Birds]].

     These were aggressive man-eating birds were terrorizing a forest near [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Stymphalia Lake Stymphalia] in northern Arcadia. Heracles scared the bird with  clappers given to him by Athena, to fear them into flight away from the forest, allowing him to shoot them down with his bow and arrow.  

7. Capture the [[Cretan Bull]].

     A harmful bull was troubling the occupants of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knossos Knossos] on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete Crete]. The [https://www.ancient.eu/Minotaur/ Minotaur] was birthed from multiple different origins according to text and websites. Heracles captured it. 

8. Steal the [[Mares of Diomedes]].

     Stables that fed on human flesh was his next challenge. Heracles task was to capture them and hand the horses over to Eurystheus. He accomplished his task by feeding the animals and luring them into a trap. 

9. Obtain the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], Queen of the [[Amazons]].

     Hippolyta was an Amazon queen and she had a girdle given to her by family. Heracles had to retrieve the girdle and return it to Eurystheus. They received a rough welcome because, ordered by Hera, the Amazons were supposed to attack the hero; however, against all odds, Heracles completed the task and secured the girdle for. 

10. Obtain the cattle of the monster [[Geryon]].

     His challenge was to capture the herd guarded by a fierce trio. They stood no chance against the hero Heracles. He defeated the trio with his trusty club and completed the task. 

11. Steal the apples of the [[Hesperides]] (he had the help of Atlas to pick them after Hercules had slain [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]]).

     These sacred fruits were protected by Hera who had set Ladon, a fearsome hundred-headed dragon as the guardian. Hercules had find where the garden was first, he asked [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nereus Nereus] for help. he came across [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus Prometheus] on his journey. Heracles shot down the eagle eating at his ribs, and in return he helped Heracles with knowledge that his brother would know where the garden was. His brother offered him help with the apples if he would help the heavens while he was gone. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology) Atlas], his brother, tricked him and did not return (understandable). A lot of trickery was going on, and Heracles managed to get Atlas under the heavens once again, and returned the apples to Mycenae. 

12. Capture and bring back [[Cerberus]].

      His last labour and undoubtedly the riskiest. Eurystheus was so frustrated he was completing everything she gave to him. He had to go down into the underworld of Hades and capture the ferocious three-headed dog Kerberos who guarded the gates. He used the souls to help convince Hades to hand over the dog. He agreed to give him the dog if he used no weapons to obtain him. Heracles succeeded and took the creature back to Mycenae, causing Eurystheus to be fearful of the power and strength of this hero.

===Further adventures===
After completing these tasks, Heracles joined the [[Argonauts]] in a search for the [[Golden Fleece]]. He also fell in love with Princess [[Iole]] of [[Oechalia (Thessaly)|Oechalia]]. [[King Eurytus of Oechalia]] promised his daughter, [[Iole]], to whoever could beat his sons in an archery contest. Heracles won but Eurytus abandoned his promise. Heracles' advances were spurned by the king and his sons, except for one: Iole's brother [[Iphitus]]. Heracles killed the king and his sons—excluding [[Iphitus]]—and abducted Iole. Iphitus became Heracles' best friend. However, once again, Hera drove Heracles mad and he threw Iphitus over the city wall to his death. Once again, Heracles purified himself through three years of servitude—this time to Queen [[Omphale]] of [[Lydia]].

===Omphale===
{{Main article|Omphale}}
[[File:Affresco romano - eracle ed onfale - area vesuviana.JPG|thumb|Heracles and [[Omphale]], Roman fresco, [[Pompeian Styles|Pompeian Fourth Style]] (45–79 AD), [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]], Italy]]

[[Omphale]] was a queen or princess of [[Lydia]].  As penalty for a murder, imposed by [[Xenoclea]], the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]], Heracles was to serve as her slave for a year. He was forced to do women's work and to wear women's clothes, while she wore the skin of the [[Nemean Lion]] and carried his [[olive-wood]] club. After some time, Omphale freed Heracles and married him. Some sources mention a son born to them who is variously named. It was at that time that the [[cercopes]], mischievous wood spirits, stole Heracles' weapons. He punished them by tying them to a stick with their faces pointing downward.

===Hylas===
While walking through the wilderness, Heracles was set upon by the [[Dryopes]]. In [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'' it is recalled that Heracles had mercilessly slain their king, [[Theiodamas]], over one of the latter's bulls, and made war upon the Dryopes "because they gave no heed to justice in their lives".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hunter, translator, ''Jason and the Golden Fleece'' (Oxford:Clarendon Press), 1993, p 31f.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of their king, the Dryopes gave in and offered him Prince [[Hylas]]. He took the youth on as his weapons bearer and beloved. Years later, Heracles and Hylas joined the crew of the ''[[Argo]]''. As Argonauts, they only participated in part of the journey. In [[Mysia]], Hylas was kidnapped by the nymphs of a local spring. Heracles, heartbroken, searched for a long time but Hylas had fallen in love with the nymphs and never showed up again. In other versions, he simply drowned. Either way, the ''Argo'' set sail without them.

===Rescue of Prometheus===
[[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' and [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Aeschylus)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' both tell that Heracles shot and killed the eagle that tortured [[Prometheus]] (which was his punishment by Zeus for stealing fire from the gods and giving it to mortals). Heracles freed the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] from his chains and his torments. Prometheus then made predictions regarding further deeds of Heracles.

===Heracles' constellation===
On his way back to [[Mycenae]] from [[Iberia]], having obtained the Cattle of [[Geryon]] as his [[The Twelve Labours|tenth labour]], Heracles came to [[Liguria]] in North-Western [[Italy]] where he engaged in battle with two giants, [[Alebion|Albion]] and [[Bergion]] or Dercynus, sons of [[Poseidon]]. The opponents were strong; Hercules was in a difficult position so he prayed to his father [[Zeus]] for help. Under the aegis of Zeus, Heracles won the battle. It was this kneeling position of Heracles when he prayed to his father Zeus that gave the name [[Engonasin#History|Engonasin]] (''"Εγγόνασιν"'', derived from "εν γόνασιν"), meaning "on his knees" or "the Kneeler",
to the constellation known as [[Hercules (constellation)|Heracles' constellation]]. The story, among others, is described by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], i. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heracles' sack of Troy===
[[File:Hall of the Augustals.jpg|thumb|A fresco from [[Herculaneum]] depicting Heracles and [[Achelous]] from [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology]], 1st century AD]]
Before [[Homer]]'s Trojan War, Heracles had made an expedition to Troy and sacked it. Previously, Poseidon had sent a sea monster to attack [[Troy]]. The story is related in several digressions in the ''Iliad'' (7.451–453, 20.145–148, 21.442–457) and is found in pseudo-Apollodorus' [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheke]] (2.5.9). This expedition became the theme of the Eastern pediment of the [[Temple of Aphaea#Eastern pediment|Temple of Aphaea]]. [[Laomedon]] planned on sacrificing his daughter [[Hesione]] to Poseidon in the hope of appeasing him. Heracles happened to arrive (along with [[Telamon]] and [[Oicles]]) and agreed to kill the monster if Laomedon would give him the horses received from Zeus as compensation for Zeus' kidnapping [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]. Laomedon agreed. Heracles killed the monster, but Laomedon went back on his word. Accordingly, in a later expedition, Heracles and his followers attacked Troy and sacked it. Then they slew all Laomedon's sons present there save [[Priam|Podarces]], who was renamed Priam, who saved his own life by giving Heracles a golden veil Hesione had made. Telamon took Hesione as a war prize and they had a son, [[Teucer]].

Heracles, thus unaware of Alcestis's fate, enjoys the hospitality of Admetus's house, drinking and revelling, which angers the servants, who wish to mourn as is their right. One scolds the guest and Heracles is ashamed of his actions.

===Death===

[[File:Muerte de Hércules, por Zurbarán.jpg|thumb|left|''Death of Hercules'' (painting by [[Francisco de Zurbarán]], 1634, Museo del Prado)]]

This is described in [[Sophocles]]'s ''[[Trachiniae]]'' and in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' Book IX.  Having wrestled and defeated [[Achelous]], god of the Acheloos river, Heracles takes [[Deianira]] as his wife.  Travelling to [[Tiryns]], a [[centaur]], [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]], offers to help Deianira across a fast flowing river while Heracles swims it.  However, Nessus is true to the archetype of the mischievous centaur and tries to steal Deianira away while Heracles is still in the water.  Angry, Heracles shoots him with his arrows dipped in the poisonous blood of the [[Lernaean Hydra]].  Thinking of revenge, Nessus gives Deianira his [[Shirt of Nessus|blood-soaked tunic]] before he dies, telling her it will "excite the love of her husband".&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'', IX l.132–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years later, [[rumor]] tells Deianira that she has a rival for the love of Heracles.  Deianira, remembering Nessus' words, gives Heracles the bloodstained shirt. Lichas, the herald, delivers the shirt to Heracles. However, it is still covered in the Hydra's blood from Heracles' arrows, and this poisons him, tearing his skin and exposing his bones.  Before he dies, Heracles throws [[Lichas]] into the sea, thinking he was the one who poisoned him (according to several versions, Lichas turns to stone, becoming a rock standing in the sea, named for him).  Heracles then uproots several trees and builds a [[funeral pyre]] on [[Mount Oeta]], which [[Poeas]], father of [[Philoctetes]], lights. As his body burns, only his immortal side is left. Through Zeus' [[apotheosis]], Heracles rises to Olympus as he dies.

No one but Heracles' friend [[Philoctetes]] ([[Poeas]] in some versions) would light his funeral pyre (in an alternate version, it is [[Iolaus]] who lights the pyre).  For this action, Philoctetes or Poeas received Heracles' bow and arrows, which were later needed by the Greeks to defeat Troy in the Trojan War.

Philoctetes confronted [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and shot a [[poisoned arrow]] at him. The Hydra poison subsequently led to the death of Paris. The Trojan War, however, continued until the [[Trojan Horse]] was used to defeat [[Troy]].

According to [[Herodotus]], Heracles lived 900 years before Herodotus' own time (c. 1300 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+2.145 II.145]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lovers==

===Women===

===Marriages===


During the course of his life, Heracles married four times.

* His first marriage was to [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]], whose children he murdered in a fit of madness. According to Pseudo-Apollodorus (Bibliotheca, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.4.12&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 2.4.12]) Megara was unharmed. According to Hyginus (Fabulae, 32), Heracles also killed Megara.

* His second wife was [[Omphale]], the [[Lydia]]n queen to whom he was delivered as a slave (Hyginus, Fabulae, 32).

* His third marriage was to [[Deianira]], for whom he had to fight the river god [[Achelous]] (upon Achelous' death, Heracles removed one of his horns and gave it to some nymphs who turned it into the [[cornucopia]]). Soon after they wed, Heracles and Deianira had to cross a river, and a [[centaur]] named [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]] offered to help Deianira across but then attempted to [[rape]] her. Enraged, Heracles shot the centaur from the opposite shore with a poisoned arrow (tipped with the Lernaean Hydra's blood) and killed him. As he lay dying, Nessus plotted revenge, told Deianira to gather up his blood and spilled semen and, if she ever wanted to prevent Heracles from having affairs with other women, she should apply them to his vestments. Nessus knew that his blood had become tainted by the poisonous blood of the Hydra, and would burn through the skin of anyone it touched. Later, when Deianira suspected that Heracles was fond of [[Iole]], she soaked a shirt of his in the mixture, creating the [[The Shirt of Nessus|poisoned shirt of Nessus]]. Heracles' servant, [[Lichas]], brought him the shirt and he put it on. Instantly he was in agony, the cloth burning into him. As he tried to remove it, the flesh ripped from his bones. Heracles chose a voluntary death, asking that a [[pyre]] be built for him to end his suffering. After death, the gods transformed him into an immortal, or alternatively, the fire burned away the mortal part of the demigod, so that only the god remained. After his mortal parts had been incinerated, he could become a full god and join his father and the other Olympians on [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mount Olympus]].

* His fourth marriage was to [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]], his last wife.

===Affairs===


An episode of his female affairs that stands out was his stay at the palace of [[Thespius]], king of [[Thespiae]], who wished him to kill the [[Lion of Cithaeron]]. As a reward, the king offered him the chance to perform [[sexual intercourse]] with all fifty of his daughters in one night. Heracles complied and they all became pregnant and all bore sons. This is sometimes referred to as his Thirteenth Labour. Many of the kings of ancient Greece traced their lines to one or another of these, notably the kings of [[Sparta]] and [[Macedon]].

Yet another episode of his female affairs that stands out was when he carried away the oxen of [[Geryon]], he also visited the country of the [[Scythians]]. Once there, while asleep, his horses suddenly disappeared. When he woke and wandered about in search of them, he came into the country of [[Hylaea (geography)|Hylaea]]. He then found the [[drakaina|dracaena]] of [[Scythia]] (sometimes identified as [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]]) in a cave. When he asked whether she knew anything about his horses, she answered, that they were in her own possession, but that she would not give them up, unless he would consent to stay with her for a time. Heracles accepted the request, and became by her the father of [[Agathyrsus]], [[Gelonus]], and [[Scythes]]. The last of them became king of the Scythians, according to his father's arrangement, because he was the only one among the three brothers that was able to manage the bow which Heracles had left behind and to use his father's girdle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] IV. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In some versions, the Scythian echidna's children by him are known as the Dracontidae and were the ancestors of a House of Cadmus.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

===Men===

[[File:Hercules and Iolaus mosaic - Anzio Nymphaeum.jpg|thumb|Heracles and [[Iolaus]] (Fountain mosaic from the [[Anzio]] Nymphaeum)]]

As a symbol of masculinity and warriorship, Heracles also had a number of male lovers. [[Plutarch]], in his ''Eroticos,'' maintains that Heracles' male lovers were beyond counting. Of these, the one most closely linked to Heracles is the [[Thebes, Greece|Theban]] [[Iolaus]]. According to a myth thought to be of ancient origins, Iolaus was Heracles' charioteer and squire. Heracles in the end helped Iolaus find a wife. Plutarch reports that down to his own time, male couples would go to Iolaus's tomb in Thebes to swear an oath of loyalty to the hero and to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Erotikos,'' 761d.The tomb of Iolaus is also mentioned by Pindar.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Olympian Odes,'' 9.98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Heracles' male lovers, and one represented in ancient as well as modern art, is [[Hylas]]. Though it is of more recent vintage (dated to the 3rd century) than that with Iolaus, it had themes of mentoring in the ways of a warrior and help finding a wife in the end. There is nothing in Apollonius's account that suggests that Hylas was a sexual lover as opposed to a companion and servant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''Argonautica,'' 1.1177–1357; [[Theocritus]], ''Idyll'' 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reputed male lover of Heracles is Elacatas, who was honored in [[Sparta]] with a sanctuary and yearly games, Elacatea. The myth of their love is an ancient one.&lt;ref&gt;Sosibius, in [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s ''Lexicon''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]]'s eponymous hero, [[Abderus]], was another of Heracles' lovers. He was said to have been entrusted with—and slain by—the carnivorous mares of Thracian [[Mares of Diomedes|Diomedes]]. Heracles founded the city of Abdera in [[Thrace]] in his memory, where he was honored with athletic games.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 2.5.8; [[Ptolemaeus Chennus]], 147b, in [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]' ''Bibliotheca''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another myth is that of [[Iphitus]].&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemaeus Chennus, in Photius' ''Bibliotheca''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another story is the one of his love for [[Nireus]], who was "the most beautiful man who came beneath Ilion" (''[[Iliad]]'', 673). But Ptolemy adds that certain authors made Nireus out to be a son of Heracles.&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemaeus Chennus, 147b.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] makes mention of [[Sostratus of Dyme|Sostratus]], a youth of Dyme, [[Achaea]], as a lover of Heracles. Sostratus was said to have died young and to have been buried by Heracles outside the city. The tomb was still there in historical times, and the inhabitants of Dyme honored Sostratus as a [[hero]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 7. 17. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The youth seems to have also been referred to as [[Polystratus]].

There is also a series of lovers who are either later inventions or purely literary conceits. Among these are [[Admetus]], who assisted in the hunt for the [[Calydonian Boar]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Erotikos,'' 761e.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adonis]],&lt;ref name="PC"&gt;Ptolemaeus Chennus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Corythus]],&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt; and [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] who was said to have been loved for his wisdom. His role as lover was perhaps to explain why he was the only son of [[Neleus]] to be spared by the hero.&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemaeus Chennus, 147e; [[Philostratus III|Philostratus]], ''Heroicus'' 696, per Sergent, 1986, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[scholia]]st on ''[[Argonautica]]'' lists the following male lovers of Heracles: "Hylas, [[Philoctetes]], Diomus, Perithoas, and Phrix, after whom a city in [[Libya]] was named".&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Apollonius Rhodius]], ''Argonautica'', 1. 1207&lt;/ref&gt; Diomus is also mentioned by Stephanus of Byzantium as the eponym of the [[deme]] [[Diomeia]] of the Attic [[phyle]] Aegeis: Heracles is said to have fallen in love with Diomus when he was received as guest by Diomus' father Collytus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. ''Diomeia''&lt;/ref&gt; Perithoas and Phrix are otherwise unknown, and so is the version that suggests a sexual relationship between Heracles and Philoctetes.

==Children==
{{Main article|Heracleidae}}

[[File:Herakles and Telephos Louvre MR219.jpg|thumb|upright|Heracles and his child [[Telephus]]. (Marble, Roman copy of the 1st or 2nd century CE)]]

All of Heracles' marriages and almost all of his heterosexual affairs resulted in births of a number of sons and at least four daughters.
One of the most prominent is [[Hyllus]], the son of Heracles and [[Deianeira]] or [[Melite (naiad)|Melite]]. The term ''Heracleidae'', although it could refer to all of Heracles' children and further descendants, is most commonly used to indicate the descendants of Hyllus, in the context of their lasting struggle for return to Peloponnesus, out of where Hyllus and his brothers—the children of Heracles by Deianeira—were thought to have been expelled by Eurystheus.

The children of Heracles by Megara are collectively well known because of their ill fate, but there is some disagreement among sources as to their number and individual names. Apollodorus lists three, Therimachus, Creontiades and Deicoon;&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'', 2. 4. 11 = 2. 7. 8&lt;/ref&gt; to these Hyginus&lt;ref&gt;''Fabulae'' 162&lt;/ref&gt; adds Ophitus and, probably by mistake, Archelaus, who is otherwise known to have belonged to the Heracleidae, but to have lived several generations later. A scholiast on [[Pindar]]' s odes provides a list of seven completely different names: Anicetus, Chersibius, Mecistophonus, Menebrontes, Patrocles, Polydorus, Toxocleitus.&lt;ref&gt;Scholia on Pindar, Isthmian Ode 3 (4), 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Other well-known children of Heracles include [[Telephus]], king of [[Mysia]] (by [[Auge]]), and [[Tlepolemus]], one of the Greek commanders in the [[Trojan War]] (by Astyoche).

According to [[Herodotus]], a line of 22 [[List of Kings of Lydia|Kings of Lydia]] descended from Hercules and Omphale. The line was called Tylonids after his Lydian name.

The divine sons of Heracles and [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] are [[Alexiares and Anicetus]].

==Heracles around the world==

===Rome===
{{Main article|Hercules in ancient Rome}}
In Rome, Heracles was honored as ''Hercules'', and had a number of distinctively Roman myths and practices associated with him under that name.

===Egypt===
[[Herodotus]] connected Heracles to the [[Egypt]]ian god [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]]. Also he was associated with [[Khonsu]], another Egyptian god who was in some ways similar to Shu. As Khonsu, Heracles was worshipped at the now sunken city of [[Heracleion]], where a large temple was constructed.

Most often the Egyptians identified Heracles with [[Heryshaf]], transcribed in [[Greek language|Greek]] as ''Arsaphes'' or ''Harsaphes'' (Ἁρσαφής). He was an ancient [[Ram (sheep)|ram]]-[[god]] whose cult was centered in [[Herakleopolis Magna]].

Via the [[Greco-Buddhist]] culture, Heraclean symbolism was transmitted to the Far East. An example remains to this day in the [[Nio]] guardian deities in front of Japanese Buddhist temples.

[[Herodotus]] also connected Heracles to [[Phoenicia]]n god [[Melqart]].

[[Sallust]] mentions in his work on the [[Jugurthine War]] that the Africans believe Heracles to have died in [[Spain]] where, his multicultural army being left without a leader, the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], and [[Armenians]] who were once under his command split off and populated the Mediterranean coast of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Jugurthine War/The Conspiracy of Catiline|last = Sallust|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 1963|isbn = |location = |pages = 54|others = Translated by S.A. Handford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temples dedicated to Heracles abounded all along the Mediterranean coastal countries.  For example, the temple of ''Heracles Monoikos'' (i.e. the lone dweller), built far from any nearby town upon a promontory in what is now the [[Côte d'Azur]], gave its name to the area's more recent name, [[Monaco]].

The gateway to the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean, where the southernmost tip of Spain and the northernmost of Morocco face each other is, classically speaking, referred to as the [[Pillars of Hercules|Pillars of Hercules/Heracles]], owing to the story that he set up two massive spires of stone to stabilise the area and ensure the safety of ships sailing between the two landmasses.

==Uses of Heracles as a name==

In various languages, variants of Hercules' name are used as a male given name, such as [[Hercule (disambiguation)|Hercule]] in French, [[Hércules]] in Spanish, Iraklis ({{lang-el|Ηρακλής}}) in Modern Greek and [[Irakli]] ({{lang-ka|ირაკლი}}) in Georgian.

There are many teams around the world that have this name or have Heracles as their symbol. The most popular in [[Greece]] is [[G.S. Iraklis Thessaloniki]].

''[[Heracleum (plant)|Heracleum]]'' is a genus of flowering plants in the carrot family [[Apiaceae]]. Some of the species in this genus are quite large. In particular, the giant hogweed (''[[Heracleum mantegazzianum]]'') is exceptionally large, growing up to 5&amp;nbsp;m tall.

==Background==
Hunt and Wilson jointly owned some farmland. After a falling out between the 2 parties, Hunt agreed to sell has share to Wilson, conditional on the price being agreed by valuers. If the valuers did not agree to a price, then the matter was to be referred to arbitration.

However, several years had passed without the valuers coming to agreement, and for unknown reasons, the matter was not subsequently referred to arbitration.

As a result, a frustrated Hunt tried to rescind the sale contract.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal rule dthat Hunt could not legally rescind this contract.

'''Joseph Mallord William Turner''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (23 April 1775{{snd}}19 December 1851), known as '''J. M. W. Turner''' and contemporarily as '''William Turner''',{{Ref label|A|a|none}} was an English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] painter, [[Printmaking|printmaker]] and [[Watercolor painting|watercolourist]]. He is known for his expressive colourisations, imaginative [[landscape painting|landscapes]] and turbulent, often violent [[Marine art|marine]] paintings.

Turner was born in [[Maiden Lane, Covent Garden]], London, to a modest lower middle-class family. He lived in London all his life, retaining his [[Cockney accent]] and assiduously avoiding the trappings of success and fame. A child prodigy, Turner studied at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] from 1789, enrolling when he was 14, and exhibited his first work there at 21. During this period, he also served as an architectural draftsman. He earned a steady income from commissions and sales, which due to his troubled, contrary nature, were often begrudgingly accepted. He opened his own gallery in 1804 and became professor of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] at the Academy in 1807, where he lectured until 1828, although he was viewed as profoundly inarticulate. He traveled to Europe from 1802, typically returning with voluminous sketchbooks.

Intensely private, [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] and reclusive, Turner was a controversial figure throughout his career. He did not marry, but fathered two daughters, Eveline (1801–1874) and Georgiana (1811–1843), by his housekeeper Sarah Danby. He became more pessimistic and morose as he got older, especially after the death of his father, after which his outlook deteriorated, and his gallery fell into disrepair and neglect, and his art intensified. He lived in near poverty circumstances and in poor health from 1845, and died in London in 1851 aged seventy-six. Turner is buried in [[Saint Paul's Cathedral]], London.

He left behind more than 550 oil paintings, 2,000 watercolours, and 30,000 paper works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turner Society Homepage |url=http://www.turnersociety.org.uk/ |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been championed by the leading English art critic [[John Ruskin]] from 1840, and is today regarded as having elevated landscape painting to an eminence rivalling [[history painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| quote="At the turn of the 18th century, history painting was the highest purpose art could serve, and Turner would attempt those heights all his life. But his real achievement would be to make landscape the equal of history painting."| last=Lacayo| first=Richard| title=The Sunshine Boy| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1670528,00.html| date=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known artistic exercise by Turner is from this period—a series of simple colourings of engraved plates from Henry Boswell's ''Picturesque View of the Antiquities of England and Wales''.&lt;ref name=Wilton14&gt;{{cite book| last=Wilton| first=Andrew| title=Turner in his time| year=2006| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson| location=London| isbn=978-0-500-23830-1| page=14| edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Around 1786, Turner was sent to [[Margate]] on the north-east [[Kent]] coast. There he produced a series of drawings of the town and surrounding area that foreshadowed his later work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wilton| first=Andrew| title=Turner in his time| year=2006|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson| location=London| isbn=978-0-500-23830-1| page=15| edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Turner's drawings were being exhibited in his father's shop window and sold for a few shillings.&lt;ref name="hamilton2007" /&gt; His father boasted to the artist [[Thomas Stothard]] that: "My son, sir, is going to be a painter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Thornbury| first=George Walter| title=The life of J.M.W.

A whole [[sketchbook]] of work from this time in Berkshire survives as well as a watercolour of Oxford. The use of pencil sketches on location, as the foundation for later finished paintings, formed the basis of Turner's essential working style for his whole career.&lt;ref name=Wilton14 /&gt;

Many early sketches by Turner were architectural studies or exercises in perspective, and it is known that, as a young man, he worked for several architects including [[Thomas Hardwick]], [[James Wyatt]] and [[Joseph Bonomi the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Hamilton| first=James| title=Turner : a life| year=1997| publisher=Sceptre| location=London| isbn=0-340-62811-1| chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1789, he had also begun to study under the topographical draughtsman [[Thomas Malton]], specialised in London views. Turner learned from him the basic tricks of the trade, copying and colouring outline prints of British castles and abbeys. He would later call Malton  "My real master".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Thornbury| first=George Walter| title=The life of J.M.W.

[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner (British - Modern Rome-Campo Vaccino - Google Art Project.jpg|left|left|thumb|''[[Modern Rome&amp;nbsp;– Campo Vaccino]]'', 1839]]
Turner entered the [[Royal Academy]] of Art in 1789, aged 14,&lt;ref name="finberg"&gt;{{cite book| last=Finberg| first=A. J.| title=The Life of J.M.W. Turner, R.A| publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]| year=1961| page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was accepted into the academy a year later by [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]]. Turner showed an early interest in architecture, but was advised by Thomas Hardwick to focus on painting. His first watercolour, ''A View of the Archbishop's Palace, Lambeth'' was accepted for the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]] of 1790 when Turner was 15.

As an academy probationer, Turner was taught drawing from plaster casts of antique sculptures. From July 1790 to October 1793, his name appears in the registry of the academy over a hundred times.&lt;ref name="hamilton1"&gt;{{cite book| last=Hamilton| first=James| title=Turner| year=2007| publisher=Random House| location=New York| isbn=978-0-8129-6791-3| at=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1792, he was admitted to the life class to learn to draw the human body from nude models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wilton| first=Andrew| title=Turner in his time| year=2006| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson| location=London| isbn=978-0-500-23830-1| page=17| edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner exhibited watercolours each year at the academy while painting in the winter and travelling in the summer widely throughout Britain, particularly to [[Wales]], where he produced a wide range of sketches for working up into studies and watercolours. These particularly focused on architectural work, which used his skills as a draughtsman.&lt;ref name="hamilton1" /&gt; In 1793, he showed the watercolour titled ''The Rising Squall&amp;nbsp;– Hot Wells from St Vincent's Rock Bristol'' (now lost), which foreshadowed his later climatic effects.&lt;ref name="wilton20"&gt;{{cite book| last=Wilton| first=Andrew| title=Turner in his time| year=2006| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson| location=London| isbn=978-0-500-23830-1| page=20| edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham in his obituary of Turner wrote that it was: "recognised by the wiser few as a noble attempt at lifting landscape art out of the tame insipidities...[and] evinced for the first time that mastery of effect for which he is now justly celebrated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Cunningham| first=Peter| title=Obituary of Turner| newspaper=[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]| date=27 December 1851| pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner - Fishermen at Sea - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Fishermen at Sea]]'', exhibited in 1796 was the first oil painting exhibited by Turner at the Royal Academy.]]
In 1796, Turner exhibited ''[[Fishermen at Sea]]'', his first oil painting for the academy, of a nocturnal moonlit scene of [[the Needles]] off the [[Isle of Wight]], an image of boats in peril.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Butlin| first=Martin| title=The paintings of J.M.W.

This particular painting cannot be said to show any influence of [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]], as not a single nocturnal scene is known by that painter. Some later work, however, was created to rival or complement the manner of the Dutch artist. The image was praised by contemporary critics and founded Turner's reputation, as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wilton| first=Andrew| title=Turner in his time| year=2006| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson| location=London| isbn=978-0-500-23830-1| page=28| edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early career ===
[[File:Portrait of J. M. W. Turner, R.A. making his sketch for the celebrated picture of Mercury &amp; Argus (4674619).jpg|thumb|Turner making his sketch for the celebrated picture of Mercury &amp; Argus, exhibited in 1836]]
Turner travelled widely in Europe, starting with France and Switzerland in 1802 and studying in [[the Louvre]] in Paris in the same year. He made many visits to Venice. Important support for his work came from [[Walter Fawkes|Walter Ramsden Fawkes]] of [[Farnley Hall (North Yorkshire)|Farnley Hall]], near Otley in Yorkshire, who became a close friend of the artist. Turner first visited Otley in 1797, aged&amp;nbsp;22, when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area. He was so attracted to Otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career. The stormy backdrop of ''[[Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps|Hannibal Crossing The Alps]]'' is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over [[the Chevin]] in Otley while he was staying at Farnley Hall.

Turner was a frequent guest of [[George O'Brien Wyndham, 3rd&amp;nbsp;Earl of Egremont]], at [[Petworth House]] in West Sussex and painted scenes that Egremont funded taken from the grounds of the house and of the Sussex countryside, including a view of the Chichester Canal. Petworth House still displays a number of paintings.

=== Personal life ===
As Turner grew older, he became more eccentric. He had few close friends except for his father, who lived with him for 30 years and worked as his studio assistant. His father's death in 1829 had a profound effect on him, and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression. He never married but had a relationship with an older widow, Sarah Danby. He is believed to have been the father of her two daughters born in 1801 and 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Roberts| first=Miquette| title=The Unknown Turner| url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/jmw-turner/joseph-mallord-william-turner-1775-1851-r1141041| publisher=[[Tate]]|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner formed a relationship with Sophia Caroline Booth after her second husband died, and he lived for about 18 years as "Mr Booth" in her house in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turnersociety.org.uk/Turner_biography.pdf|title=Turner Biography &amp; Chronology&amp;nbsp;– The Turner Society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner was a habitual user of [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]]; in 1838, [[Louis Philippe I]], [[List of French monarchs|King of the French]] presented a gold [[snuff box]] to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=74762&amp;partid=1&amp;output=People%2F!!%2FOR%2F!!%2F116764%2F!%2F116764-3-18%2F!%2FPrevious+owner%2Fex-collection+Louis+Philippe%2C+King+of+the+French%2F!%2F%2F!!%2F%2F!!!%2F&amp;orig=%2Fresearch%2Fsearch_the_collection_database%2Fadvanced_search.aspx&amp;currentPage=1&amp;numpages=200 |title=Collection Online: Snuff Box/box| publisher=[[British Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of two other snuffboxes, an [[agate]] and silver example bears Turner's name,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.finch-and-co.co.uk/archive/antiquities/d/georgian-silver-and-agate-pocket-snuff-box-inscribed-â%C2%80%C2%98joseph-mallord-william-tur/117264 |title=Georgian Silver and Agate Pocket Snuff Box Inscribed 'Joseph Mallord William Turner' and the date '1785'| publisher=Finch &amp; Co| accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another, made of wood, was collected along with his spectacles, magnifying glass and card case by an associate housekeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.philipmould.com/gallery/all-works/107| title=Spectacles, glass, snuffbox and cardcase of Turner 1775–1851| publisher=Philip Mould &amp; Company| accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
Turner died of [[cholera]] at the home of Sophia Caroline Booth, in [[Cheyne Walk]] in Chelsea, on 19 December 1851. He is buried in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], where he lies near to Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]].&lt;ref&gt;David Blayney Brown, ‘Joseph Mallord William Turner 1775–1851’, artist biography, December 2012, in David Blayney Brown (ed.), J.M.W.

Turner's friend, the architect [[Philip Hardwick]] (1792–1870), son of his tutor, [[Thomas Hardwick]], was in charge of making the funeral arrangements and wrote to those who knew Turner to tell them at the time of his death that, "I must inform you, we have lost him."{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Other executors were his cousin and chief mourner at the funeral, Henry Harpur&amp;nbsp;IV (benefactor of [[Westminster Hospital|Westminster&amp;nbsp;– now Chelsea &amp; Westminster&amp;nbsp;– Hospital]]), Revd.

Turner's talent was recognised early in his life. Financial independence allowed Turner to innovate freely; his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint. According to David Piper's ''The Illustrated History of Art'', his later pictures were called "fantastic puzzles". Turner was recognised as an artistic genius: the influential English art critic [[John Ruskin]] described him as the artist who could most "stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of Nature".&lt;ref&gt;(Piper 321)&lt;/ref&gt; Turner's work drew criticism from contemporaries, in particular from [[Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet|Sir George Beaumont]], a landscape painter and fellow member of the Royal Academy, who described his paintings as 'blots'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilkinson | first = Gerald | title = The Sketches of Turner, R.A. | publisher = Barrie &amp; Jenkins | location = London | date = 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner's imagination was sparked by shipwrecks, fires (including the [[burning of Parliament]] in 1834, an event which Turner witnessed first-hand, and transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches), and natural phenomena such as sunlight, storm, rain, and fog. He was fascinated by the violent power of the sea, as seen in ''Dawn after the Wreck'' (1840) and ''[[The Slave Ship]]'' (1840).

Turner's major venture into printmaking was the ''[[Liber Studiorum]]'' (Book of Studies), seventy prints that he worked on from 1806 to 1819. The ''Liber Studiorum'' was an expression of his intentions for landscape art. The idea was loosely based on [[Claude Lorrain]]'s ''[[Liber Veritatis]]'' (Book of Truth), where Lorrain had recorded his completed paintings; a series of print copies of these drawings, by then at [[Devonshire House]], had been a huge publishing success.  Turner's plates were meant to be widely disseminated, and categorised the genre into six types: Marine, Mountainous, Pastoral, Historical, Architectural, and Elevated or Epic Pastoral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=J.M.W.

Turner's early works, such as ''[[:File:Turner Tintern1.jpg|Tintern Abbey]]'' (1795), stayed true to the traditions of English landscape. However, in ''[[Snow Storm: Hannibal and His Army Crossing the Alps|Hannibal Crossing the Alps]]'' (1812), an emphasis on the destructive power of nature had already come into play. His distinctive style of painting, in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints, created lightness, fluency, and ephemeral atmospheric effects.&lt;ref&gt;Piper 321&lt;/ref&gt;

In Turner's later years he used oils ever more transparently and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour. A prime example of his mature style can be seen in ''[[Rain, Steam and Speed – The Great Western Railway]]'', where the objects are barely recognisable. The intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed Turner's work in the vanguard of English painting but exerted an influence on art in France; the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], particularly [[Claude Monet]], carefully studied his techniques.

High levels of volcanic ash (from the eruption of [[Mt. Tambora]]) in the atmosphere during 1816, the "[[Year Without a Summer]]", led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period, and were an inspiration for some of Turner's work.

[[John Ruskin]] said that an early patron, [[Thomas Monro]], Principal Physician of [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]], and a collector and amateur artist, was a significant influence on Turner's style:
&lt;blockquote&gt;His true master was Dr Monro; to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study, in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by his friend [[Thomas Girtin|Girtin]], the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed; the greatness of the power itself, it is impossible to over-estimate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Together with a number of young artists, Turner was able, in the London house of Dr. Monro, to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing. But the curious atmospherical effects and illusions of the watercolours of [[John Robert Cozens]], some of which were present in Monro's house, went far further than the neat renderings of topography. The solemn grandeur of his Alpine views were an early revelation to the young artist and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium, conveying mood instead of information.

As a result, many of his colours have now faded. John Ruskin complained at how quickly his work decayed; Turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w486V_or5P8C&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=turner+|title=Color: A Natural History of the Palette|last=Finlay|first=Victoria|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|year=2004|isbn=0-8129-7142-6|pages=134–135|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1930, there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were fading.&lt;ref name="perth"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article83121606|title=Colors That Fade: Turner's Masterpieces: Can his works be saved?|date=9 January 1930|work=[[The Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News]]|page=2|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Turner left a small fortune which he hoped would be used to support what he called "decayed artists". He planned an almshouse at [[Twickenham]] with a gallery for some of his works. His will was contested and in 1856, after a court battle, his first cousins, including [[Thomas Price Turner]], received part of his fortune.&lt;ref name=Monkhouse&gt;{{cite book| title=The Great Artists: J.M.W. Turner R.A.| first=William Cosmo| last=Monkhouse| year=1879| page=121| publisher=Scribner and Welford| location=New York| url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40878/40878-h/40878-h.htm#page_121| accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another portion went to the Royal Academy of Arts, which occasionally awards students the Turner Medal. His finished paintings were bequeathed to the British nation, and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them. This did not happen due to disagreement over the final site. Twenty-two years after his death, the British Parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside London, and so began the process of scattering the pictures which Turner had wanted to be kept together.

In 1910, the main part of the Turner Bequest, which includes unfinished paintings and drawings, was rehoused in the Duveen Turner Wing at the [[Tate Britain|National Gallery of British Art]] (now Tate Britain). In 1987, a new wing at the Tate, the [[Clore Gallery]], was opened to house the Turner bequest, though some of the most important paintings remain in the National Gallery in contravention of Turner's condition that they be kept and shown together. Increasingly paintings are lent abroad, ignoring Turner's provision that they remain constantly and permanently in Turner's Gallery.

[[St.&amp;nbsp;Mary's Church, Battersea]] added a commemorative stained glass window for Turner, between 1976 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.clara.net/pkennington/VirtualTour/windows_modern.htm#Turner| title=St. Mary's Church Parish website| quote=St Mary's Modern Stained Glass}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Paul's Cathedral, Royal Academy of Arts and Victoria &amp; Albert Museum all hold statues representing him. A portrait by Cornelius Varley with his patent graphic telescope (Sheffield Museums &amp; Galleries) was compared with his death mask (National Portrait Gallery, London) by Kelly Freeman at Dundee University 2009–10 to ascertain whether it really depicts Turner. The city of Westminster unveiled a memorial plaque at the site of his birthplace at 21 Maiden Lane, [[Covent Garden]] 2 June 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=City of Westminster| url=http://transact.westminster.gov.uk/greenplaques/displaybyname.cfm| title=Joseph Mallord William Turner| accessdate=3 September 2014| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015135/http://transact.westminster.gov.uk/greenplaques/displaybyname.cfm| archivedate=3 December 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selby Whittingham founded The Turner Society at London and Manchester in 1975. After the society endorsed the Tate Gallery's Clore Gallery wing (on the lines of the Duveen wing of 1910), as the solution to the controversy of what should be done with the Turner Bequest, Selby Whittingham resigned and founded the Independent Turner Society. The Tate created the prestigious annual [[Turner Prize]] art award in 1984, named in Turner's honour, and 20 years later the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours]] founded the Winsor &amp; Newton Turner Watercolour Award. A major exhibition, "Turner's Britain", with material (including ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'') on loan from around the globe, was held at [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] from 7 November 2003 to 8 February 2004. In 2005, Turner's ''The Fighting Temeraire'' was voted Britain's "greatest painting" in a public poll organised by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name=greatest&gt;{{cite news| title=Turner wins 'great painting' vote| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4214824.stm| date=5 September 2005| work=[[BBC News]]| accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 ''[[The Painter (play)|The Painter]]'', a biographical play on his life by [[Rebecca Lenkiewicz]], premiered at the [[Arcola Theatre]] in London.

British filmmaker [[Mike Leigh]] wrote and directed ''[[Mr. Turner]]'', a biopic of Turner's later years, released in 2014. The film starred [[Timothy Spall]] as Turner, Dorothy Atkinson, Marion Bailey and Paul Jesson, and premiered in competition for the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' at the 2014 [[Cannes Film Festival]], with Spall taking the award for Best Actor.&lt;ref name=child&gt;{{cite news| title=Timothy Spall to play JMW Turner in Mike Leigh biopic| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/23/timothy-spall-jmw-turner-mike-leigh| last=Child| first=Ben| work=[[The Guardian]]| date=23 October 2012| accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ch4&gt;{{cite web| title=Mr. Turner| url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/2014/mr-turner| publisher=[[Film 4]]| accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} Although Turner was known by his middle name, William, he is now generally referred to by his initials, in order to avoid confusion with another artist named [[William Turner (artist)|William Turner]].

'''b.''' {{Note label|B|b|none}} Turner claimed to have been born on 23 April 1775, which is both [[Saint George's Day]] and the supposed birthday of [[William Shakespeare]], but this claim has never been verified.&lt;ref name="shanes2008" /&gt; The first verifiable date is that Turner was baptised on 14 May, and some authors doubt the 23 April date, on the grounds that high infant mortality rates would have meant that parents would usually baptise their children shortly after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=James|title=Turner|year=2007|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8129-6791-3|edition=Random House Trade Paperback|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''c.'''{{Note label|C|c|none}}  Mary Marshall died in 1804, after having been committed in 1799 to St Luke's Hospital and then to the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]], a [[mental asylum]]. Her illness possibly due in part to the early death of Turner's younger sister. Hamilton suggests that this "fit of illness" may have been an early sign of her madness.

==Overview of Children's Speech Corpora==

In the table below, the age range may be described in terms of school grades. "K" denotes "kindergarten" while "G" denotes "grade". For example, an age range of "K - G10" refers to speakers ranging from kindergarten age to grade 10.

This table is based on a paper from the Interspeech conference, 2016.&lt;ref name="chen2016"&gt;Nancy F. Chen, Rong Tong, Darren Wee, Peixuan Lee, Bin Ma and Haizhou Li. ''SingaKids-Mandarin: Speech Corpus of Singaporean Children Speaking Mandarin Chinese'', in Proc. of Interspeech, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This online article is intended to provide an interactive table for readers and a place where information about children speech corpora that can be updated continuously by the speech research community.

''Летапісы беларуска-літоўскія'' // ''Вялікае княства Літоўскае: Энцыклапедыя'' (шin Belarusian). У 3 т. / рэд. Г. П. Пашкоў і інш.

All redactions were written in the [[Ruthenian language]] and served the needs of Lithuanian patriotism.&lt;ref name=tar/&gt; The first edition, compiled in the 1420s, glorified [[Vytautas the Great]] and supported his side in power struggles. The second redaction, prepared in the first half of the 16th century, started the myth of Lithuanian Roman origin: it gave a fanciful [[genealogy]] of [[Palemon]], a noble from the [[Roman Empire]] who founded the Grand Duchy. This noble origin of Lithuanians was important in cultural rivalry with the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]]. The third redaction, known as the [[Bychowiec Chronicle]], elaborated even further on the legend, but also provided some useful information about the second half of the 15th century. The three redactions, the first known historical accounts produced within the Grand Duchy, gave rise to the [[historiography]] of [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref name=zi/&gt; All medieval historians used these accounts, that survived in over 30 known manuscripts,&lt;ref name=garsk/&gt; as basis for their publications and some of the myths created in the chronicles persisted even to the beginning of the 20th century.

==First or short redaction==
{{Wikisourcelang|la|Origo regis Jagyelo et Wytholdi ducum Lithuanie}}
The first or the short redaction (also known as ''Chronicle of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania'' or ''Letopisec Litovskii'') was compiled sometime in the 1420s in [[Smolensk]], when [[Vytautas the Great]] hoped to be crowned as [[King of Lithuania]].&lt;ref name=zi/&gt; This redaction included the earliest known historical account produced in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: ''Dis ist Witoldes sache wedir Jagalan und Skargalan'', a complaint and memorial written by Vytautas in 1390 during the [[Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392)]].&lt;ref name=el/&gt; It detailed his power struggles against cousins [[Jogaila]] and [[Skirgaila]] in 1379–1390 and supported his claims to his patrimony in [[Trakai]] and title of Grand Duke of Lithuania. Two translations of this document survive: Latin ''Origo regis Jagyelo et Witholdi ducum Lithuanie'' from the 15th century and Russian ''Litovskomu rodu pochinok'' from the 14th century.&lt;ref name=tar/&gt; Later this document was expanded to include events up to 1396.&lt;ref name=tar2/&gt; It formed the backbone of the first chronicle.

The first redaction survived only from later manuscripts and compilations. The earliest known compilation was prepared in Smolensk around 1446 by bishop Gerasim and his clerk Timofei.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; The compilation also included a praise to Vytautas, written by Gerasim, a story about [[Podolia]], written in 1431–1435 to support the Lithuanian claims against Poland in the [[Lithuanian Civil War (1431–1435)|Lithuanian Civil War]],&lt;ref name=tar2/&gt; a description of power struggles between [[Švitrigaila]] and [[Sigismund Kęstutaitis]], a short summary of Moscow's chronicles (854–1428),&lt;ref name=tar/&gt; and latest events in Smolensk (1431–1445).&lt;ref name=el/&gt; The compilation also did not survive in its original state. It is known from several manuscripts:&lt;ref name=el/&gt;&lt;ref name=jucas/&gt;
* Supraśl Manuscript, written in the middle of the 15th century and preserved in a 1519 copy found in the [[Supraśl Orthodox Monastery]]
* Avraamka or [[Vilnius]] Manuscript, written by a Smolensk monk named Avraamka in 1495 and found in a Vilnius library
* [[Aleksey Uvarov|Uvarov]] or [[Slutsk]] Manuscript, written at the court of [[Olelkovich]], prince of Slutsk and descendant of [[Gediminas]], in the 15th century
* Academic Manuscript, written in the first half of the 16th century, found in [[Vologda]], and published in 1903, is incomplete
* Nikiforov Manuscript, belonged to the [[Holy Spirit Cathedral (Minsk)|Holy Spirit Cathedral]] in Minsk and was published by {{illm|Sergey Belokurov|ru|Белокуров, Сергей Алексеевич}} in 1898, is incomplete

==Second redaction==
The second, more extensive, redaction (also known as ''Chronicle of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Samogitia'') was compiled in the second half of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th century&lt;ref name=tar/&gt; (the final version probably came into existence around the 1520s at the court of [[Albertas Goštautas]]).&lt;ref name='Gudmantas'/&gt; The redaction traced back the foundations of the Lithuanian state to the 1st century, when legendary [[Palemon]] escaped from [[Roman Empire]] and settled at the mouth of [[Dubysa]]. He founded the [[Palemonids]] dynasty and became the first ruler of Lithuania.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; This legendary part was then followed by the revised first redaction, detailing the lineage of the [[Gediminids]]. [[Mindaugas]], the [[Kingdom of Lithuania|first King]] of Lithuania crowned in 1253, and other earlier historically attested dukes were skipped entirely.&lt;ref name=zi/&gt; The elaborate story that Lithuanians were of noble Roman origins had no historical basis and was discarded by modern historians as nothing more than a myth.&lt;ref name=rowell/&gt;

While many modern historians discount the text as useless, it can still provide useful bits and pieces of Lithuanian history as it incorporates many garbled fragments of earlier, now lost, documents and chronicles.&lt;ref name=rowell/&gt; Also, the mythical Palemon is a good evidence of political tensions and cultural ideology of the [[Lithuanian nobles]] in the 16th century. This myth served Lithuanian interests in conflicts with Poland and Russia. Poland, then in [[Polish–Lithuanian union|personal union with Lithuania]], claimed that it brought civilization to this barbaric pagan land. By creating fanciful genealogies, linking Lithuanians with noble Romans, the Lithuanian nobility could counter these claims and demand political independence.&lt;ref name=el/&gt;

This redaction rarely included dates and contained several independent stories that were cherished by 19th century nationalists: legends how [[Gediminas]] founded [[Vilnius]] because of his dreams of [[Iron Wolf (character)|Iron Wolf]], how [[Kęstutis]] took pagan priestess [[Birutė]] for his wife, how [[Vytautas]] lavishly treated his guests at the [[Conference of Lutsk]] in 1429, etc.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; Among them were some factual stories, including [[Algirdas]]' [[Lithuanian–Muscovite War (1368–72)|three sieges of Moscow]].&lt;ref name=tar2/&gt; This format differed significantly from other [[slavs|Slavic]] chronicles that tended to list inter-related events year-by-year.&lt;ref name=tar/&gt; The second redaction also considerably trimmed and fragmented parts about [[Ruthenia]] and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]; thus the text became primarily about Lithuania. The chronicle was popular and often copied.&lt;ref name=zi/&gt; It shaped the political mentality of the Lithuanian nobility, formed the basis for the Lithuanian [[historiography]] until the dawn of the 20th century, and inspired many literary works.

Several manuscripts are known:&lt;ref name=jucas/&gt;
*Krasiński Manuscript, written in the early 16th century, found in a collection of the [[Krasiński family]] in Warsaw
*Archaeological Society Manuscript, written in the early 16th century
*Alševa Manuscript, written in 1550 by a likely native Lithuanian speaker, found in a Chomiński library in {{illm|Alševa|pl|Olszew (Białoruś)}}
*Raczyński or Poznań Manuscript, written around 1580, gifted by [[Edward Raczyński (1786–1845)|Edward Raczyński]] to [[Raczyński Library|Poznań Library]]
*Evreinov Manuscript, written in mid-16th century
*Rumyantsev Manuscript, written in the 17th-century, first published by the [[Rumyantsev Museum]] in 1902

==Third or broad redaction==
{{main|Bychowiec Chronicle}}

The third and most extensive redaction is known as the [[Bychowiec Chronicle]]. It is based on the second redaction. It is believed that this redaction was prepared around the same time as the second redaction with support from [[Albertas Goštautas]].&lt;ref name=bychovo/&gt; The only known version was discovered in a manor owned by [[Aleksander Bychowiec]] and was published in full by [[Teodor Narbutt]] in 1846. This chronicle was updated to include events up to 1574.&lt;ref name=rowell/&gt; Initially there were doubts if the chronicle is authentic and some suggested that Narbutt falsified it. The doubts were inspired by its sudden discovery and its peculiar similarity with the chronicles of [[Maciej Stryjkowski]]; also Narbutt is known to have falsified several other documents.&lt;ref name=zi/&gt; However, new evidence came to light that portions of the chronicle were published in 1830. Historians now suggest that similarity with Stryjkowski's works resulted from using the same document, maybe even the original third redaction, as the source.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; Further, in 2011, Lithuanian historians discovered a fragment (about one-fifth of the original) of the third redaction at the {{illm|National Archives in Kraków|pl|Archiwum Narodowe w Krakowie}} and published it in 2018.&lt;ref name=gudma/&gt;

The patriotic themes were even more prevalent than in the second redaction. It continued to elaborate on the Palemon legend: to improve chronology Palemon was moved to the 5th century Rome, devastated by [[Attila the Hun]], and Mindaugas and other historical dukes were incorporated into the legend.&lt;ref name=zi/&gt; It also concentrated more on the [[Catholic Church]] than earlier revisions, which paid closer attention to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref name=rowell/&gt; It is an important source for the late 15th century events, especially years of [[Alexander Jagiellon]].&lt;ref name=tar/&gt;

==Publication==
The popularity of the ''Chronicle of Poland, Lithuania, Samogitia and all of Ruthenia'', published by [[Maciej Stryjkowski]] in 1582, pushed the old handwritten Lithuanian chronicles into obscurity.&lt;ref name=garsk/&gt; They were rediscovered with the advent of professional [[historiography]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when historians began to critically analyze [[primary sources]] to verify various claims. That necessitated the publication of primary sources. The first Lithuanian Chronicle, the Supraśl Manuscript, was published in 1823 by {{illm|Ignacy Daniłowicz|pl}}.&lt;ref name=jucas/&gt; In 1846, [[Teodor Narbutt]] published the [[Bychowiec Chronicle]]. Other historians published other manuscripts that they had found. In 1860s, the [[Archaeographic Commission]] became interested in collecting and publishing all known manuscripts of the Lithuanian Chronicles. Twelve manuscripts were published in 1907 as volume 17 of the ''[[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles]]'' as West Russian Chronicles ({{lang-ru|Западнорусские летописи}}), which became the standard reference. The collection, newly compiled and edited by [[Mikałaj Ułaščyk]], was published as volumes 32 (1975) and 35 (1980) of the ''Complete Collection''.&lt;ref name=jucas/&gt; However, despite the discovery of several other manuscripts since 1907, the new volumes did not include them.&lt;ref name=tumel/&gt;

Most Serbian words are of native [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] lexical stock, tracing back to the [[Proto-Slavic language]]. There are many [[loanword]]s from different languages, reflecting cultural interaction throughout history. Notable loanwords were borrowed from Greek, Latin, Italian, Turkish, Hungarian, Russian, and German.

==Overview==
It is estimated that there are 900–1,200 Greek,{{sfn|Vlajić-Popović|2009|p=387}} 88–188 German,{{sfn|Alanović|2014|p=118}} and an uncertain high number of Turkish loanwords{{sfn|Nomachi|2015|p=48}} in modern Serbian.

==History==

===Proto-Slavic===
{{see also|Proto-Slavic borrowings}}
Ancient Greek words in Proto-Slavic are identified through phonetic features, some related to Greek phonetic history, others possibly Scythian-Sarmatian or Gothic mediations.{{sfn|Vlajić-Popović|2015|p=156}} Ancient Greek, non-mediated words are ''korablja'' (ark), ''koliba'' (cottage, hut), and supposedly ''trem'' (porch); [[Scythian languages|Scythian]] mediations are ''luk'' (onion), ''haluga'' (fence), ''koš'' (basket), ''talog'' (dregs), ''kurva'' (whore); supposedly [[Gothic language|Gothic]] mediations are ''crkva'' (church) and ''daska'' (plank).{{sfn|Vlajić-Popović|2015|p=157}} There exists loanwords in Proto-Slavic from non-Indo-European languages. Among Turanian ([[Ural-Altaic]]) lexemes, estimated to have been adopted between the 3rd and 7th century, surviving into modern Serbian are ''čaša'' (cup), ''knjiga'' (book), ''kovčeg'' (chest), ''krčag'' (pitcher), ''sablja'' (sabre).{{sfn|Radić|2015|p=134}} Adoptions from [[Proto-Avar|Avaric]] in the 6th–7th centuries are the titles ''[[ban (title)|ban]]'' and ''[[župan]]'', and ''[[klobuk]]'' (a type of hat).{{sfn|Radić|2015|pp=134–135}} South Slavic was also influenced by [[Bulgar language|Bulgar]] since their arrival in the eastern Balkans in the 7th century, e.g. ''beleg'' (landmark), ''beočug'' (shackle), ''bubreg'' (kidney), ''pašenog'' (co-brother-in-law), ''tojaga'' (bludgeon).{{sfn|Radić|2015|p=135}}

===Old Serbian===
The South Slavic languages were greatly influenced by Greek beginning in the [[Early Middle Ages]], through translation of [[Byzantine literature|Byzantine works]], leaving religious, philosophical and psychological terms.{{sfn|Ivić|1995}} Late medieval speech had very few loanwords, rather replacing Greek words with calques for linguistical purity.{{sfn|Ivić|1995}} German linguist [[Max Vasmer|Vasmer]] (1944) recorded 1,000 Greek words in Serbian, most of which were addressed in the Old Serbian form.{{sfn|Vlajić-Popović|2009|p=379}} Today, it is estimated that 900–1,200 Grecisms (''grecizmi'') exist in Serbian, more than 400 being in the church-religious section.{{sfn|Vlajić-Popović|2009|p=387}} In the economical section, apart from Greek, many words in Old Serbian were [[Romance languages|Romance]].{{sfn|Ivić|1995}} In mining, the majority of words were [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], arriving with [[Saxons in medieval Serbia|Saxons]].{{sfn|Ivić|1995}}

===Modern history===
The Ottoman conquest began a linguistical contact between Turkish and South Slavic; Turkish influence grew stronger after the 15th century.{{sfn|Nomachi|2015|p=48}} Besides Turkish loanwords, also many Arabic (such as ''alat'', "tool", ''sat'', "time, clock") and Persian (''čarape'', "socks", ''šećer'', "sugar") words entered via Turkish, called "Orientalisms" (''orijentalizmi'').{{sfn|Nomachi|2015|p=48}} Also, many Greek words entered via Turkish.{{sfn|Nomachi|2015|p=48}} Words for hitherto unknown sciences, businesses, industries, technologies and professions were brought by the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Nomachi|2015|p=48}} Christian villagers brought urban vocabulary from their travels to Islamic culture cities.{{sfn|Nomachi|2015|pp=48–49}} Many Turkish loanwords are no longer considered loanwords.{{sfn|Nomachi|2015|p=49}}

===Contemporary history===
English influence is seen in recent times, with the common suffixes ''-er'' and ''-ing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Štasni|Štrbac|2015}}, {{harvnb|Štrbac|Štasni|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are ''kasting'', ''ketering'', ''konsalting'', ''listing'', ''džoging'', ''šoping'', etc.{{sfn|Štrbac|Štasni|2014|p=102}} Foreign loanwords are becoming more frequent in sports terminology.{{sfn|Milić|Sokić|1998}}

==Comparison with other Serbo-Croatian variants==
The differences between Serbian and Croatian is mainly reflected in loanwords.{{sfn|Mønnesland|1973|p=197}} Bosnian has the most Turkish loanwords of all Serbo-Croatian variants.{{sfn|Nomachi|2015|p=48}}

===Purism===
 {{see also|Linguistic purism}}
Serbo-Croatian vocabulary is of mixed origin, with words borrowed from Greek, Latin, Italian, Turkish, Hungarian, and more recently Russian, Czech and German. Most loanwords have entered Serbian without resistance, while on the other hand in Croatian, [[linguistic purism]] was adopted as a policy during [[Austria-Hungary]] (against presumed [[Germanization]]) and later in Yugoslavia (against presumed Serbian domination). In Croatia, the term "Serbisms" is used for characteristically Serbian words,{{sfn|Lečić|2014}} unwanted during [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]] and the [[Yugoslav wars]], many of which have been replaced by neologisms.{{sfn|Klajn|2008}}

'''Martin Beck''' is a fictional [[Swedish police]] [[detective]] who is the main character in a series of ten novels by [[Maj Sjöwall]] and [[Per Wahlöö]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/22/crime-thriller-maj-sjowall-sweden | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=The queen of crime | first=Louise | last=France | date=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; collectively titled ''The Story of a Crime''. The stories are frequently referred to as the Martin Beck stories. All of the novels have been adapted to films between 1967 and 1994, six of which featured [[Gösta Ekman]] as Martin Beck. Between 1997 and 2018 there have also been 38 films (some only broadcast on television) based on the characters, with [[Peter Haber]] as Martin Beck.

==Series==
[[File:Maj Sjöwall 01.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Maj Sjöwall]], joint author of the series.]]
Sjöwall and Wahlöö, during the 1960s and 1970s, conceived and wrote a series of ten novels ([[police procedural]]s) about the exploits of [[detective]]s from the special homicide commission of the Swedish national police in which the character of Martin Beck was the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/252700230|title=Whodunit? : a who's who in crime &amp; mystery writing|last=Rosemary.|first=Herbert,|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=0195157613|location=|pages=17|oclc=252700230|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both authors also wrote novels separately. For the Martin Beck series, they plotted and researched each book together and then wrote alternate chapters.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The books cover ten years and are renowned for extensive character and setting development throughout the series. This is in part due to careful planning by Sjöwall and Wahlöö.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Scene of the Crime: The Importance of Place in Crime and Mystery Fiction|last = Geherin|first = David|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==

=== Primary characters ===
[[File:Gösta Ekman in August 2014.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gösta Ekman]], who played Martin Beck in the [[Martin Beck#Films with Gösta Ekman|1993/1994 film series]] of 6 books.]]
;Martin Beck: The protagonist of the series, throughout the novels, Martin Beck goes from being an unhappily married man and father of two young teenagers, to a divorced man in a happy unmarried relationship with Rhea Nielsen, a kind and emphatic landlady whom Beck meets while investigating the death of a man who was Nielsen's tenant. Beck is prone to colds and often suffers from ailments and physical discomforts. Beck also gets several promotions, from Detective to Inspector, and Chief of the National Murder Squad by the end of the series, seemingly much to the chagrin of everyone involved, including himself as he hates the vision of being confined to desk work, though in ''Cop Killer'', he is thankfully spared a promotion to a Commissioner. In ''The Terrorists,'' he is however forced to become Chief of Operations in an important job protecting an American senator, meaning that he is for once, in theory, higher in position than his superior, Malm. He is allowed to assemble his perfect team, consisting of himself, Larsson, Rönn, Skacke and Melander. He does extremely well coordinating the desk work and keeping in communication (through allowing Melander to handle all telephone communications, and diverting all telephone calls, or even switching off the telephone altogether whenever he needs time to think), impressing the Commissioner. In ''The Abominable Man'' he is shot and severely wounded, and quits smoking after the incident as his favourite manufacturer discontinues his preferred type of cigarette.

;Lennart Kollberg: Beck's most trusted colleague: a sarcastic glutton with a [[Socialist]] [[worldview]]; served as a [[paratrooper]] and now refuses to carry a gun&amp;mdash;after having shot and killed a person while in the line of duty. He is newly married in the second book and fathers two children over the course of the series. In ''The Fire Engine That Disappeared'', he refers to Gunvald Larsson as "the stupidest detective in the history of criminal investigation", and in ''The Abominable Man'', Larsson informs him, "I've always thought you were a fucking idiot", though they later end up, through working with each other on numerous investigations, understanding each other. He resigns from the force at the end of the penultimate book, ''Cop Killer'', after realising he was ashamed of what the police force had become, but still has the last word in the final installment.
[[File:Mikael Persbrandt på premiär.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Mikael Persbrandt]] who played Larsson in the 1997-2015 film series.]]
;Gunvald Larsson: A former member of the [[merchant marine]] and the black sheep of a rich family; he has a liking for expensive clothes and [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] including the work of [[Sax Rohmer]]. He is also one of very few people outside [[East Germany]] who owns and drives a [[sports car]] manufactured by [[Eisenacher Motorenwerk]]. He is somewhat lacking in interpersonal skills and is disliked by most of his colleagues. He and Kollberg share a mutual antipathy, but are capable of working together efficiently when the occasion demands it. However, despite the fact that he often treats Einar Rönn with the same boorishness and insensitive tactlessness that he does everybody else, Rönn is his only friend and the two are close, often spending time together outside of the job. His rich, cultured family taught him how to behave correctly in all circumstances, something which the Commissioner notes that he tries to conceal. His upbringing has also meant that Larsson has a penchant for expensive clothes, not least tailored suits, which have a tendency to in various ways, get ruined during his investigations. He is tall and has china blue eyes, and is in extremely good shape, being noted as the best in the team at breaking down doors.

;Einar Rönn: Larsson's friend from the rural north of Sweden; permanently red-nosed, incapable of writing a coherent report and totally unimaginative, but a hard-working and efficient policeman. He is very calm and peaceful, only losing his temper once (on Larsson's behalf) in all the books. By the end of the series, Beck notes that he had defied all expectations to become a valuable asset to the team, and someone whom he could trust.

;Benny Skacke: A young ambitious, overzealous and sometimes hapless detective. He is introduced in the fifth book as a new member of the homicide commission, but later transfers to Malmö for personal reasons. Skacke is still somewhat naïve, seeking to become police commissioner, but he is noted by Beck in the last book as having matured significantly.

;Fredrik Melander: Noted for his flawless memory and for always being in the lavatory when anyone wants him. Melander is described as a first-class policeman in ''The Fire Engine That Disappeared,'' but also as very boring. Some of his other peculiar characteristics include his insistence on getting ten hours of sleep every night and his unreadable handwriting. He is also noted for having no temper and being immune to flattery. He later transfers to the Burglary and Theft division in an effort to avoid overtime. Therefore, he features only briefly in the later books in the series (except ''The Terrorists''). In ''the Terrorists'', his skill for being able to have a conversation with someone where despite a long conversation, nothing actually gets done, means that Beck puts him in charge of telephone communications.

;Evald Hammar: Beck's boss until he retires in the end of ''The Fire Engine That Disappeared''. He is mild-mannered, trusts his men's judgment and dislikes the political infighting which increasingly accompanies his job.

;Stig Malm: Beck's boss from ''Murder at the Savoy'' onwards. A politician with little understanding of police work who is willing to do anything to get up the career ladder, for whom Beck eventually feels sorry by the end of the book; he is often ordered around by the Commissioner. He has an overly high opinion of himself, not hampered by his one case as Chief of Operations ending in disaster.

===Other major characters===
;Kurt Kvant and Karl Kristiansson: Lazy and inept partner patrolmen from [[Skåne]] who have a tendency to get shouted at by Larsson, at one point trampling all over a crime scene (and randomly shooting a hole in the roof of the crime scene) causing an investigation to take months as no footprints or fingerprints could be taken. After Kvant is killed in ''The Abominable Man'', Kristiansson has a new partner, '''Kenneth Kvastmo''', who is equally inept but far more zealous.

;Per Månsson: A leisurely but very competent [[Malmö]] detective who becomes involved in several of Beck's cases. He is particularly known for his searching skills.

;Åke Stenström: A young detective noted for his [[Surveillance|shadowing]] skills, who is killed in ''The Laughing Policeman''.

;Åsa Torell: Widow of Åke Stenström who later decides to become a cop. She appears prominently in ''Murder at the Savoy'' and ''The Terrorists''.

===Minor recurring characters===
;Backlund: An unimaginative and rigid detective in Malmö.

;Inga Beck: Martin Beck's wife, whom he later divorces.

;Ingrid Beck: Martin Beck's daughter, often described as mature and independent and has a good relationship with her father, often going out for dinner together. She urges Beck to leave Inga.

;Rolf Beck: Martin Beck's lazy son, with whom he has a poor relationship. Beck finally admits to himself in a later book that he dislikes the boy.

;Rune Ek: One of the detectives. The character is usually minor, but appears more prominently in ''The Laughing Policeman''.

;Elofsson and Borglund: Two partner patrolmen in [[Malmö]]. They appear in ''The Fire Engine that Disappeared'' and ''Cop Killer''. In the later book, Borglund is killed.

;Norman Hansson: A uniformed police sergeant in some of the books.

;Oskar Hjelm: A highly skilled but vain and temperamental forensic scientist, who is highly susceptible to flattery, something utilised on a daily basis by Beck.

;Gun Kollberg: Kollberg's young wife and mother of his two children.

;Rhea Nielsen: Martin Beck's new girlfriend after he divorces his wife. She is an open socialist, and enjoys cooking. The series ends with Kollberg and his wife Gun, and Beck and Nielson having a happy New Years' party, in a perfect atmosphere with Nielsen's delicious cooking. She is a landlady, having inherited a block of apartments, which, unlike many other landlords, she takes good care of, building a community around her apartments, which are deliberately cheaper than average, and well refurbished. She meets Beck in ''The Locked Room'', as the ex-landlady of the deceased man. She is intelligent and straight-talking and is a social worker.

;Herrgott Nöjd (Herrgott Allwright in English translations): A down-to-earth police from the rural district of Anderslöv, who gets on well with just about anybody. Appears in the books ''Cop Killer'' and ''The Terrorists''.

;Sten Robert "Bulldozer" Olsson: A very busy, energetic and enthusiastic public prosecutor in charge of investigating and prosecuting bank robbers; has a big part in ''The Locked Room''. He is known for being so busy with often 10 cases at once that he never appeals a case after losing, which he rarely does.

;Strömgren: A Stockholm detective with a minor role in some of the books. Little is known about him, but he is disliked by both Beck and Larsson. In ''The Terrorists'' he apparently is a spy for Bulldozer Olsson.

;Richard Ullholm: A pedantic and nit-picking detective in some of the books, who is constantly making official complaints of his colleagues over usually minor details.

;Bo Zachrisson: A very mediocre policeman, who bungles the initial investigation in ''The Locked Room'' and later lets the Prime Minister get assassinated in ''The Terrorists'', after Eric Möller, the chief of Security Police, mistakes Larsson's "CS" (meaning [[Idiot|Clod]] Squad) list of policemen who should not be used for any important duties, as the "Commando Section".

All ten novels have been adapted to film, although some have appeared with different titles and four have been filmed outside Sweden. The first actor to play Martin Beck was [[Keve Hjelm]] in 1967. [[Carl-Gustaf Lindstedt]] portrayed Beck in 1976. In 1993 and 1994, [[Gösta Ekman]] played the character in six films. To the American audiences, the most notable actor to play Martin Beck is [[Walter Matthau]] from the 1973 film called ''[[The Laughing Policeman (film)|The Laughing Policeman]]'', although his character was called "Jake Martin." Martin Beck has also been played by [[Jan Decleir]], [[Derek Jacobi]] and [[Romualds Ancāns]]. Two of the novels have been adapted for films twice, ''Roseanna'' and ''Murder at the Savoy''. In the later films which are only based on the characters, Martin Beck is played by [[Peter Haber]].

== Impact ==
[[Sjöwall and Wahlöö]]'s technique of mixing traditional [[crime fiction]] with a focus on the social issues in the Swedish welfare state received a great deal of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Public Eye: Ideology and the Police Procedural|last = Winston|first = Robert|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been updated in the 1990s with [[Henning Mankell]]'s detective character [[Kurt Wallander]] and in the 2000s with [[Stieg Larsson]]'s [[Millennium series|''Millennium'']] trilogy featuring [[Lisbeth Salander]]. The basic concept has, by extension, given rise to the entire [[Scandinavian noir]] scene. The Mystery Writers of America, in 1995, rated [[The Laughing Policeman (novel)|The Laughing Policeman]] as the 2nd best police procedural, after [[Tony Hillerman|Tony Hillerman's]] [[Dance Hall of the Dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Terrorists|last = Sjowall|first = Maj|publisher = Harper Collins|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = (rear of book) 17|last2 = Wahloo|first2 = Per}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of that date a CPI(M) procession passing through the village  had attacked the four [[Naxalite]] farm labourers who were in their fields. The mob beat them with sticks and hacked them to death. The dead were identified as Sheikh Jiauddin, Sheikh Mannan, Sudhir Ghosh and Nirmal Ghosh, supporters of the [[Kanu Sanyal]] faction of the CPI(ML).&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=Statesman/&gt;

The district judge of Birbhum, Dipak Saha Ray, awarded life terms to 46 CPI(M) cadres for their involvement in the Muluk murder case on 31 March 2009. The convicted CPI(M) cadres included Akhtar Sheikh, the then CPI(M} upapradhan of Muluk gram panchayat, Roushan Ali, the then CPI(M) panchayat samiti member, Mistri Murmu, the then CPI(M} gram panchayat member and Safiul Rahaman, the then CPI(M) branch committee secretary. Besides them, two primary school teachers, an employee of state electricity board and a NVF staff were also among those convicted. Of the 56 chargsheeted in the case, 10 had died.  The convicts had been found guilty under Sections 302, 307 and 149 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). They were also to pay a fine of Rs 5,000 each.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=Statesman/&gt;

The '''National Archives and Records Administration''' ('''NARA''') is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency of the United States government]] charged with preserving and documenting government and historical records and with increasing public access to those documents, which comprise the National Archives.&lt;ref name="what"&gt;{{cite web|  url=https://www.archives.gov/about/info/whats-an-archives.html |title=What's an Archives |publisher=archives.gov| date=|  accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NARA is officially responsible for maintaining and publishing the legally authentic and authoritative copies of [[acts of Congress]], [[presidential directives]], and federal regulations. The NARA also transmits votes of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] to Congress.

==Organization==
{{Main|Organization of the National Archives and Records Administration}}
The [[Archivist of the United States]] is the chief official overseeing the operation of the National Archives and Records Administration. The Archivist not only maintains the official documentation of the passage of [[Constitutional_amendment#United_States|amendments]] to the [[U.S. Constitution]] by state legislatures, but has the authority to declare when the constitutional threshold for passage has been reached, and therefore when an act has become an amendment.

The [[Office of the Federal Register]] publishes the ''[[Federal Register]]'', ''[[Code of Federal Regulations]]'', and ''[[United States Statutes at Large]]'', among others. It also administers the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]].

The National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC)—the agency's grant-making arm—awards funds to state and local governments, public and private archives, colleges and universities, and other nonprofit organizations to preserve and publish historical records.  Since 1964, the NHPRC has awarded some 4,500 grants.

The Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) is a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) resource for the public and the government. Congress has charged NARA with reviewing FOIA policies, procedures and compliance of Federal agencies and to recommend changes to FOIA. NARA's mission also includes resolving FOIA disputes between Federal agencies and requesters.

==History==
[[File:ArchivesRotunda.jpg|thumb|left|Rotunda of the National Archives Building]]
Originally, each branch and agency of the U.S. government was responsible for maintaining its own documents, which often resulted in the loss and destruction of records. [[United States Congress|Congress]] established the [[National Archives Establishment]] in 1934 to centralize federal record keeping, with the [[Archivist of the United States]] as chief administrator.&lt;ref&gt;[https://research.archives.gov/id/299840 Act of June 19, 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-432, 48 Stat. 1122] (establishing the National Archives).&lt;/ref&gt; The National Archives was incorporated with [[General Services Administration|GSA]] in 1949; in 1985 it became an independent agency as NARA (National Archives and Records Administration).

The first Archivist, [[R.D.W. Connor]], began serving in 1934, when the National Archives was established by [[United States Congress|Congress]]. As a result of a first [[Hoover Commission]] recommendation, in 1949 the National Archives was placed within the newly formed [[General Services Administration]] (GSA).  The Archivist served as a subordinate official to the GSA Administrator until the National Archives and Records Administration became an independent agency on April 1, 1985.

In March 2006, it was revealed by the Archivist of the United States in a public hearing that a memorandum of understanding between NARA and various government agencies existed to "reclassify", i.e., withdraw from public access, certain documents in the name of national security, and to do so in a manner such that researchers would not be likely to discover the process (the [[U.S. reclassification program]]).&lt;ref name="secret"&gt;{{cite web| title=Secret Agreement Reveals Covert Program to Hide Reclassification from Public| date=April 11, 2006| url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/news/20060411/index.htm| publisher=National Security Archive| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An audit indicated that more than one third withdrawn since 1999 did not contain sensitive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/27/washington/27archives.html?ref=nationalarchivesandrecordsadministration| title=National Archives Says Records Were Wrongly Classified | author= Scott Shane| date= April 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program was originally scheduled to end in 2007.

In 2010, [[Executive Order 13526]] created the National Declassification Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/declassification/ |title=National Archives and Declassification |publisher=Archives.gov |date=October 19, 2011 |accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to coordinate [[declassification]] practices across agencies, provide secure document services to other agencies, and review records in NARA custody for declassification.

In 2011, a retired employee pleaded guilty to stealing original sound recordings from the archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-10-04/news/bs-md-government-property-thefts-20111004_1_national-archives-employee-jason-savedoff-plea-agreement| title=National Archives employee pleads guilty to stealing recordings| date=October 4, 2011|author=Tricia Bishop| work= The Baltimore Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Banks |first=Kathy |url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Guilty-Plea-in-National-Archives-Thefts-131063748.html |title=Guilty Plea in National Archives Audio Thefts |publisher=NBC Washington |date= |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/09/141192267/ex-employee-caught-putting-national-archives-on-ebay |title=Ex-Employee Put National Archives On eBay |publisher=NPR |date=October 9, 2011 |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Archival Recovery Team]]s investigate the theft of records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/08/nation/la-na-treasure-hunters-nu-20100809| title=Guardians of the nation's attic| date=August 8, 2010| author=Faye Fiore| work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records==
NARA's holdings are classed into "record groups" reflecting the governmental department or agency from which they originated. Records include paper documents, microfilm, still pictures, motion pictures, and electronic media.

Archival descriptions of the permanent holdings of the federal government in the custody of NARA are stored in the National Archives Catalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=NARA|title=The National Archives Catalog|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archival descriptions include information on traditional paper holdings, electronic records, and artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=NARA|title=Open Government at the National Archives|url=https://www.archives.gov/open/dataset-arc.html|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of December 2012, the catalog consisted of about 10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] logical data records describing 527,000 artifacts and encompassing 81% of NARA's records.&lt;ref name=ARC/&gt; There are also 922,000 digital copies of already digitized materials.&lt;ref name=ARC&gt;{{cite web|last=NARA|title=About Archival Research Catalog (ARC)|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/arc/about-arc.html|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most records at NARA are in the [[public domain]], as works of the federal government are excluded from [[copyright]] protection. However, records from other sources may still be protected by copyright or donor agreements.&lt;ref name="copyright"&gt;{{cite web| title=Copyright, Permissions and Restrictions Notice| url=https://www.archives.gov/global-pages/privacy.html| date=| publisher=archives.gov| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Executive Order 13526]] directs originating agencies to declassify documents if possible before shipment to NARA for long-term storage,&lt;ref&gt;Section 3.2 (d)&lt;/ref&gt; but NARA also stores some [[classified document]]s until they can be [[declassified]].  Its [[Information Security Oversight Office]] monitors and sets policy for the U.S. government's security classification system.

Many of NARA's most requested records are frequently used for [[genealogy]] research. This includes [[census]] records from 1790 to 1940, ships' passenger lists, and [[naturalization]] records.

==Facilities and exhibition spaces==
{{main|National Archives facilities}}
[[File:National Archives DC 2007s.jpg|thumb|The [[National Archives Building]] from [[Constitution Avenue]]]]
The most well known facility of the National Archives and Records Administration is the [[National Archives Building]] (informally known as "Archives I"), located north of the [[National Mall]] on [[Constitution Avenue]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].  A sister facility, known as the [[National Archives at College Park]] (or "Archives II") was opened 1994 near the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]].  The [[Washington National Records Center]] (WNRC), also located in the Washington, D.C., metro area, is a large warehouse type facility which stores federal records that are still under the control of the creating agency.  Federal government agencies pay a yearly fee for storage at the facility.  In accordance with federal records schedules, documents at WNRC are transferred to the legal custody of the National Archives after a certain point (this usually involves a relocation of the records to College Park).  Temporary records at WNRC are either retained for a fee or destroyed after retention times has elapsed.  WNRC also offers research services and maintains a small research room.

Across the United States, the National Archives maintains both research facilities and additional federal records centers.  In many cases, the research rooms of regional archives are located at the same site of the federal records center (FRCs) which are not accessible to the public.  

===Public–private partnerships===
In an effort to make its holdings more widely available and more easily accessible, the National Archives began entering into public–private partnerships in 2006. A joint venture with [[Google]] will digitize and offer NARA video online. When announcing the agreement, Archivist Allen Weinstein said that this pilot program is
&lt;blockquote&gt;… an important step for the National Archives to achieve its goal of becoming an archive without walls. Our new strategic plan emphasizes the importance of providing access to records anytime, anywhere. This is one of many initiatives that we are launching to make our goal a reality. For the first time, the public will be able to view this collection of rare and unusual films on the Internet."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite press release |title=National Archives and Google Launch Pilot Project to Digitize and Offer Historic Films Online |date=24 February 2006 |publisher=archives.gov |accessdate=March 31, 2011 |url=https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2006/nr06-64.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On January 10, 2007, the National Archives and Fold3.com (formerly Footnote)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footnote.com |title=footnote.com |publisher=footnote.com |date= |accessdate=November 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched a pilot project to digitize historic documents from the National Archives holdings. Allen Weinstein explained that this partnership would "allow much greater access to approximately 4.5 million pages of important documents that are currently available only in their original format or on microfilm" and "would also enhance NARA's efforts to preserve its original records."&lt;ref name="footnote"&gt;{{cite press release |title=National Archives and Footnote Launch Project to Digitize Historic Documents |url=http://archives.gov/press/press-releases/2007/nr07-41.html |publisher=archives.gov |date=January 10, 2007 |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, the National Archives announced it would make copies of its collection of [[Universal Newsreel]]s from 1929 to 1967 available for purchase through [[CreateSpace]], an [[Amazon.com]] subsidiary. During the announcement, Weinstein noted that the agreement would "... reap major benefits for the public-at-large and for the National Archives." Adding, "While the public can come to our College Park, MD research room to view films and even copy them at no charge, this new program will make our holdings much more accessible to millions of people who cannot travel to the Washington, DC area." The agreement also calls for CreateSpace partnership to provide the National Archives with digital reference and preservation copies of the films as part of NARA's preservation program.&lt;ref name="create"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Thousands of National Archives Films to Be Made Available Through CustomFlix Labs |date=July 27, 2007 |url=https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2007/nr07-122.html |accessdate=March 31, 2011 |publisher=archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, the National Archives announced a five-year agreement to digitize selected records including the complete U.S. Federal Census Collection, 1790–1930, passenger lists from 1820–1960 and World War I and World War II draft registration cards.&lt;ref name="ancestry"&gt;{{cite press release |title=National Archives Announces Digitizing Agreement with The Generations Network |url=https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2008/nr08-105.html |publisher=archives.gov |date=May 20, 2008 |accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership agreement allows for exclusive use of the digitized records by [[Ancestry.com]] for a 5-year embargo period at which point the digital records will be turned over to the National Archives.&lt;ref name="ancestryagr"&gt;{{cite web|title=NARA The Generations Network Digitization Agreement |url=https://www.archives.gov/digitization/pdf/tgn-agreement.pdf |publisher=archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social media===

The National Archives currently utilizes [[social media]] and [[Web 2.0]] technologies in an attempt to communicate better with the public.&lt;ref name="social"&gt;{{cite web| title=Social Media and Web 2.0 at the National Archives| url=https://www.archives.gov/social-media/| date=| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 2009, the National Archives announced the launching of a YouTube channel "to showcase popular archived films, inform the public about upcoming events around the country, and bring National Archives exhibits to the people."&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite press release| title=National Archives Launches YouTube Channel| url=https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2009/nr09-95.html| date=June 18, 2009| accessdate=March 31, 2011| publisher=archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2009, the National Archives launched a Flickr photostream to share portions of its photographic holdings with the general public.&lt;ref name="flickr"&gt;{{cite web| title=National Archives Photos on Flickr: FAQs| url=https://www.archives.gov/social-media/flickr-faqs.html| date=| accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A new teaching with documents website premiered in 2010 and was developed by the education team.  The website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docsteach.org|title=DocsTeach|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; features 3,000 documents, images, and recordings from the holdings of the Archives. The site also features lesson plans and tools for creating new classroom activities and lessons.

In 2011, the National Archives initiated a WikiProject on the English Wikipedia to expand collaboration in making its holdings widely available through Wikimedia.

The '''Natural History Museum at Tring''' was the [[private museum]] of [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Lionel Walter, 2nd Baron Rothschild]]; today it is under the control of the [[Natural History Museum, London]]. It houses one of the finest collections of [[Taxidermy|stuffed]] mammals, birds, reptiles and insects in the United Kingdom. It was first known as the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum; however, in April 2007 the NHM changed its name.&lt;ref name= tringmuseum/&gt; The museum is located on [[Akeman Street]], in [[Tring]], [[Hertfordshire]].

==History==
[[File:WalterRothschildWithZebras.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Walter Rothschild and zebra-drawn carriage]]
The Natural History Museum at Tring was once the private museum of [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Lionel Walter, 2nd Baron Rothschild]], and is located in the grounds of the former [[Mayer Amschel Rothschild family|Rothschild]] family home of [[Tring Park]]. The building was constructed in 1889 to house his collection of mounted specimens and first opened to the public in 1892. The Rothschild family gave the Museum and its contents to the nation in 1937.&lt;ref name= tringmuseum/&gt; Lionel Walter bred hybrids between zebras and horses ([[zebroid]]s) and a hybrid foal is on display. He was frequently seen riding a zebra-drawn carriage. The museum's Zebra Cafe alludes to Lord Rothschild's love of zebras and has photographs of his trained zebras harnessed to open carriages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/tring/history-collections/index.html Zebra-drawn carriage driven by Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild], Accessed 12-11-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The extensive collection, housed in several rooms, includes extinct animals and birds such as the [[quagga]], [[thylacine]], [[great auk]] and reconstructions of the [[moa]] and [[dodo]]. Oddities include hybrids and examples of abnormal coloration. The dogs display was relocated to the Rothschild Zoological Museum from the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], South Kensington, London after World War II. This shows how domestic dogs have changed shape due to selective breeding and includes the tiny Russian and Mexican [[lapdog]]s as well as famous racing [[greyhound]]s. The Museum has six galleries, each one of which houses a different set of animals. The first gallery contains [[bird]]s, [[carnivora|large carnivorans]] and [[primate]]s, the second is used to show temporary exhibits, the third [[crocodilia]]ns, [[crustacean]]s, [[fish]]es, [[insect]]s, large mammals and [[marine invertebrates]], the fourth accommodates [[kangaroos]] and [[odd-toed ungulate]]s, the fifth holds [[bovid]]s, [[hippopotamus]]es, [[pig]]s and [[marine mammals]], and finally the sixth gallery contains [[amphibia]]ns, [[bat]]s, various British mammals, [[dog|domestic dogs]], [[ratite]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, [[turtle]]s and small mammals. The Museum also contains a Discovery Room, designed for young children and the Rothschild Room which is a room set out to recreate the surroundings that the Rothschild family would have worked in. It became part of the Natural History Museum in 1937. In April 2007 its name was changed to the Natural History Museum at Tring.&lt;ref name= tringmuseum/&gt; 

The site is also home to the ornithological research collections (Bird Group, Department of Zoology) and the ornithological library (Department of Library and Information Services) of The Natural History Museum, but these are not open to the public. There are small special themed exhibitions throughout the year showcasing specimens not normally on display, as well as activities for youngsters.&lt;ref name= tringmuseum&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/tring/about-the-natural-history-museum-at-tring.html About the Natural History Museum at Tring], Accessed 16-08-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thefts from museum==

===Bird skins===
On 24 June 2009 a theft occurred from the museum involving removal of 299 brightly coloured stuffed birds, mostly male [[trogon]]s and [[quetzal]]s from [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], as well as [[birds of paradise]] from the island of [[New Guinea]] some of which had been collected by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;Pimm, Stuart (17 April, 2018). [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04556-9 When feathers flew at a natural-history archive] [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]&lt;/ref&gt;. The police announced on 12 November 2010 that a 22-year-old US citizen had been arrested, in the Tring area, in connection with the theft and the majority of bird skins had been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-11748586 Arrest over theft of 299 rare bird skins in Tring "BBC News online"], Accessed 12-11-2010&lt;/ref&gt; Edwin Rist, a student at The Royal Academy of Music, pleaded guilty to the theft on 24 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-11845699 Flute player admits theft of 299 rare bird skins BBC News online], Accessed 25-11-2011&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 Rist was given a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, and a supervision order. He was also required to repay £125,150, the estimated proceeds from selling the skins through such outlets as [[eBay]]. The police also advised that 191 intact bird skins had so far been recovered, of which only 101 had labels recording the birds' key scientific data.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-14352867 Natural History Museum thief ordered to pay thousands "BBC online"], Accessed 30-07-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhinoceros horns===
In the early hours of 27 August 2011  a thief broke in through the museum's front doors and removed the horns from two rhinoceros exhibits, one [[Indian rhinoceros|Indian rhino]] the other a [[white rhinoceros|white rhino]], using, it was believed a large hammer. However, in the light of recent thefts from other museums, three months before the break-in, curators had replaced the real rhino horns, valued at £240,000, with replica ones made from resin which had no commercial value.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-14693144 Rhino horn raiders steal replicas from Tring museum "bbc news online"], Accessed, 27-08-2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hhkkbNqt5-jP7XBsHnneiIE43gnQ?docId=CNG.b8c6206079ef2416b87f96a4bc571f48.b1 "AFP"], Accessed, 27-08-2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January 2012 Darren Bennett from [[Leicester]] was charged with the theft of two replica rhinoceros horns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-16590484 Tring museum replica rhino horn theft: Man charged '''BBC News online'''], Accessed 19 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ProgrammableWeb''' is an information and news source about the Web as a programmable platform. It is a subsidiary of [[MuleSoft]] and has offices in San Francisco, CA. The website publishes a repository of web APIs, mashups, and applications, and has documented over 12,000 open web [[Application programming interface|APIs]] and thousands of applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory|title=API Directory|work=ProgrammableWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been called the "journal of the API economy" by TechCrunch.&lt;ref name = "editor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/07/veteran-news-editor-david-berlind-joins-programmable-web-the-journal-of-the-api-economy/|title=Veteran News Editor David Berlind Joins Programmable Web, The Journal Of The API Economy|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
ProgrammableWeb was founded in 2005 by John Musser and had documented 1,000 APIs by November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/11/03/let-a-thousand-web-apis-blossom/|title=Let A Thousand Web APIs Blossom|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In June 2010, Alcatel-Lucent acquired ProgrammableWeb as part of a move by the company to align themselves closer to the developer community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alcatel-lucent-acquires-leading-web-20-api-repository-programmableweb-97374309.html|title=Alcatel-Lucent Acquires Leading Web 2.0 API Repository ProgrammableWeb|author=Alcatel-Lucent|date=29 June 2010|work=prnewswire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcatel-Lucent was looking to integrate ProgrammableWeb’s API monitoring services and other API related technologies with its own Open API Service and Developer Platform to strengthen its relationship with developers. During ProgrammableWeb’s time with Alcatel-Lucent, they documented over 8,000 APIs.
 
Three years later on April 13, 2013, MuleSoft announced the acquisition of ProgrammableWeb to "become the go-to destination for APIs and Integration”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mulesoft.com/mulesoft-acquires-programmableweb|title=MuleSoft Acquires ProgrammableWeb|work=MuleSoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''Public records''' are documents or pieces of information that are not considered [[confidential]] and generally pertain to the conduct of government.

For example, in [[California]], when a couple fills out a [[marriage license]] application, they have the option of checking the box as to whether the [[marriage]] is "confidential" (Record will be closed, and not opened to public once recorded) or "public" (record will become public record once recorded). Essentially, if the marriage record is public, a copy of the record can be ordered from the [[county]] in which the marriage occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090107012514/http://www.publicrecords101.com/ "Article from Public Records 101"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the earliest organised [[Society|societies]], with [[tax]]ation, disputes, and so on, records of some sort have been needed. In ancient [[Babylon]] records were kept in [[cuneiform writing]] on clay tablets. In the [[Inca]] empire of [[South America]], which did not have writing, records were kept via an elaborate form of knots in cords, [[quipu]], whose meaning has been lost.

In [[Western Europe]] in the [[Late Middle Ages]] public records included [[census]] records as well as records of birth, death, and marriage; an example is the 1086 ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of [[William the Conqueror]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/normans/doomsday_01.shtml "The Domesday Book", BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; The details of [[Royal intermarriage|royal marriage]] agreements, which were effectively [[International treaty|international treaties]], were also recorded. The United Kingdom Public Record Office Act, which formalised record-keeping by setting up the [[Public Record Office]], was passed in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/legislation/history-of-pra.htm "History of the Public Records Acts", The National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public records==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
Although public records are records of public business, they are not necessarily available without restriction, although [[Freedom of Information legislation]] (FOI) that has been gradually introduced in many jurisdictions since the 1960s has made access easier. Each government has policies and regulations that govern the availability of information contained in public records. A common restriction is that data about a person is not normally available to others; for example, the [[California Public Records Act]] (PRA) states that "except for certain explicit exceptions, personal information maintained about an individual may not be disclosed without the person's consent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=06001-07000&amp;file=6250-6270 California Public Records Act] CA Codes (gov:6250-6270) - Official California Legislative Information&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] papers were subject to the [[thirty-year rule]]: until the introduction of FOI legislation, Cabinet papers were not available for thirty years; some information could be withheld for longer. {{As of|2011}} the rule still applies to some information, such as [[minutes]] of Cabinet meetings.

Some companies provide access, for a fee, to many public records available on the Internet. Many of them specialize in particular types of information, while some offer access to different types of record, typically to professionals in various fields. Some companies sell software with a promise of unlimited access to public records, but may provide nothing more than basic information on how to access already available and generally free public websites.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011|reason=for whole paragraph}}

Each year news media, civic groups, libraries, nonprofits, schools and others interested groups sponsor "Sunshine Week." Sunshine Week occurs in mid-March, coinciding with [[James Madison]]'s birthday and National Freedom of Information Day on the 16th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunshine Week|url=http://sunshineweek.rcfp.org/|website=Sunshine Week|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the week is to highlight the idea that "government functions best when it operates in the open."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dukes|first1=Tyler|title=Sunshine Week to celebrate government transparency|url=http://www.wral.com/sunshine-week-to-celebrate-government-transparency/15520676/|accessdate=13 March 2016|publisher=WRAL|date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many states, [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] are often exempt from public-records laws that apply to state executive officials and local officials. In 2016, the Associated Press made a request for the emails and daily schedules of state legislative leaders (speakers of state Houses and presidents of state Senates) in all 50 states; a majority denied the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lieb|first1=David A.|title=Many state legislatures exempt themselves from record laws|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/politics-government/article65959872.html|agency=Associated Press|date=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court records===
Of particular significance was the evolution of the common-law right "to access court records to inspect and to copy".  The expectation inherent in the common law right to access court records is that any person may come to the office of the clerk of the court during business hours and request to inspect court records, with almost instantaneous access. Such right is a central safeguard of the integrity of the courts.  Any decision to conceal court records requires a sealing order. The right to access court records is also central to liberty: There is no conceivable way to exercise the Habeas Corpus right, deemed by the late Justice Brennan&lt;ref&gt;[[William J. Brennan, Jr.]]&lt;/ref&gt; as "the cornerstone" of the United States Constitution, absent access to court records as public records.

In the United States the [[common law]] right to "access court records to inspect and to copy" was reaffirmed by the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Supreme Court in ''Nixon v Warner Communications, Inc'' (1978), where the court found various parts of the right to access court records as inherent to the First, Fourth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. In the United States access to court records is governed by Civil Rights in the Amendments to the United States Constitution, not by the Freedom of Information Act.

As court records become increasingly more accessible online, concerns about the undermining of private information has become a significant issue. In the past, obtaining court records required people to physically go to a courthouse and request documents, making privacy concerns essentially obsolete. However, with the relative ease at which people can now access these records, highly sensitive information (i.e. victim names, social security numbers, etc.) are at risk of being publicly exploited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ardia|first=David S.|date=2017|title="Privacy and Court Records: Online Access and the Loss of Practical Obscurity."|url=|journal=University of Illinois Law Review 2017|volume=4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United States===
Access to U.S.&amp;nbsp;national public records is guided by the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA). Requests for access to records pursuant to FOIA may be refused by federal agencies if information requested is subject to exemption, or some information may be redacted (deleted).

In addition to the national FOIA, all [[Freedom of information in the United States|states have some form of FOI legislation]]. For example, [[Colorado]] has the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA);&lt;ref&gt;[http://198.187.128.12/colorado/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=fs-main.htm&amp;2.0 Colorado Open Records Act] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803205616/http://198.187.128.12/colorado/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=fs-main.htm&amp;2.0 |date=August 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New Jersey]] the law is known as the Open Public Records Act (OPRA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.gov/grc/act.html Open Public Records Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many degrees of accessibility to public records between states, with some making it fairly easy to request and receive documents, and others with many exemptions and restricted categories of documents. One state that is fairly responsive to [[public records requests]] is [[New York (state)|New York]], which utilizes the Committee on Open Government to assist citizens with their requests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dos.ny.gov/coog/ Committee on Open Government]&lt;/ref&gt; A state that was fairly restrictive in how they respond to public records requests is [[Pennsylvania]], where the law formerly presumed that all documents are exempt from disclosure, unless they can be proven otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/vassilaros/s_519212.html Pa.'s open secret] By Dimitri Vassilaros(July 27, 2007)- ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review''&lt;/ref&gt; This was changed by a 2008 bill that went into effect in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.openrecords.pa.gov/Documents/RTKL/pa_righttoknowlaw.pdf |publisher=Pennsylvania Office of Open Records |title=Pennsylvania’s New Right to Know Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The California Public Records Act (''California Government Code'' §§6250-6276.48) covers the [[arrest]] and booking records of inmates in the State of California [[Types of incarceration facilities|jails and prison]]s, which are not covered by [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment rights]] ([[freedom of speech]] and of the [[Freedom of the press|press]]). Public access to arrest and booking records is seen as a critical safeguard of liberty.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Uses of public records====
With the advent of the Internet and the information age, access to public records in the United States to anyone who wishes to view them has dramatically increased. Third parties such as the [[information broker]] industry make regular use of public records to compile readily accessible profiles on millions of people, and may make a profit from the service of recompiling and mining the data.

Public record data is used for multiple purposes, such as ensuring that child support payments are made as determined by the courts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/pubs/2008/annual_report/ Office of Child Support Enforcement] FY 2005 Annual Report to Congress May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; assisting [[credit bureau]]s in keeping accurate data&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/testimony/040615idtheftssntest.pdf FTC.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; and helping to pay [[pension]] benefits to retirees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waysandmeans.house.gov/legacy.asp?file=legacy/socsec/107cong/5-22-01/5-22lero.htm Waysandmeans.house.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061228081839/http://waysandmeans.house.gov/legacy.asp?file=legacy%2Fsocsec%2F107cong%2F5-22-01%2F5-22lero.htm |date=2006-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Access to criminal records in the United States====
Individual criminal histories are generally considered to be public records in the United States and are often accessed via criminal history [[background check]]s, but "access and use of [[FBI]]-maintained criminal history record information has been traditionally limited and controlled in large measure to protect the privacy of the individuals to whom the records pertain."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ag_bgchecks_report.pdf THE ATTORNEY GENERAL’S REPORT ON CRIMINAL HISTORY BACKGROUND CHECKS], U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General, June 2006, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The federal [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] imposes "fair information-practice requirements by consumer reporting agencies that report public record information, such as criminal history records, for employment purposes," and some state consumer-protection laws impose more restrictive regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ag_bgchecks_report.pdf THE ATTORNEY GENERAL’S REPORT ON CRIMINAL HISTORY BACKGROUND CHECKS], U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General, June 2006, pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press]], in the United States, arrest records "are generally open to the public unless they concern an active or ongoing investigation. A few states restrict the information that can be obtained from an arrest record, especially when it concerns individuals who were never charged, were acquitted or had their records expunged. Again, the determination will often result in a balancing test comparing the public's interest in disclosure against the individual privacy interest."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rcfp.org/private-eyes/arrest-records Media Law Resources: Arrest Records], Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, protective custody and [[juvenile delinquency]] records are exempted from most state open-records laws, such that access is "limited to the juvenile, his or her parents or guardians, or other parties directly involved in a legal matter."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rcfp.org/private-eyes/juvenile-records Juvenile Records], Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Destruction of public records====
In early 2018, the National Archives put up a webpage, [https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/resources/unauthorizeddispositionoffederalrecords "Unauthorized Disposition of Federal Records,"] to publish all instances of investigations into possible unauthorized destruction of records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Howard|first1=Alex|title=National Archives publishes online dashboard of its investigations into lost, altered or destroyed public records|url=https://sunlightfoundation.com/2018/04/24/national-archives-publishes-online-dashboard-of-its-investigations-into-lost-altered-or-destroyed-public-records/|accessdate=25 May 2018|publisher=Sunlight Foundation|date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R v Shein'''''&lt;ref&gt;1925 AD 6.&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in South African law, heard in the Appellate Division, Bloemfontein, on 15 September 1924, with judgment handed down on 3 October. Innes CJ, Solomon JA, De Villiers JA, Kotz JA and Wessels JA presided. The court found that the [[evidence]] on which a [[jury]] is entitled to [[convict]] upon a [[criminal]] charge is evidence on which [[reasonable person|reasonable men]] could properly convict. If the evidence produced cannot be so described, the court will set aside the verdict not as deciding the facts itself, but because the jury has not, in its opinion, duly discharged the judicial duty cast upon it. If, on the other hand, the evidence does answer to that description, the court will refuse to interfere, not because it would have come to the same conclusion itself, but because no ground exists for interference with the discharge of a duty entrusted by law to the jury alone.

== Facts ==
A jury had convicted the accused on a charge of arson.

== Judgment ==
The court found that there was evidence before the jury on which reasonable men could properly have convicted, and therefore refused to interfere with the verdict. A person who sets fire to the house of another must be taken to have contemplated and intended injury to the owner of the house, whether such owner is insured or not. The court followed the judgment in ''[[R v Kewelram]]''.&lt;ref&gt;1922 AD 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Time for Kids Almanac''''' is a yearly [[almanac]] published in the [[United States]] by [[Meredith Corporation]] as an adjunct to their ''[[Time for Kids]]'' magazine.

The reference book begins with the "Year in Review," which tells of events that have taken place in the prior year, and ends with "What's Next?" which describes interesting or significant events expected in the coming year.

The series has won many honors, including the Teacher's Choice Award, Best Children's Reference Book Award, and the "A-List" pick from ''[[FamilyFun]]'' magazine.
