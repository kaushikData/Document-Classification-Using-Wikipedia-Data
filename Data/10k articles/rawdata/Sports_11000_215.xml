* [[Tom Cribb]] retains his English championship but no fights involving him are recorded in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/cribb.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Tom Cribb] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5gVUt4ZMo?url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/cribb.htm |date=2009-05-04 }}.

* Leading English player [[George Osbaldeston]] strikes his name from the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] members list in anger. He later repents and tries to restore himself but his application is blocked by his enemy, [[Lord Frederick Beauclerk]]. Osbaldeston can no longer play at [[Lord's]] and that effectively ends his first-class career.
'''England'''
* Most runs&lt;ref name="cards"&gt;Note that scorecards created in the first quarter of the 19th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the '''known''' totals and the missing data prevents effective computation of averages&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Billy Beldham]] 103 (HS 49)

The '''1871 Victorian football season''' was an [[Australian rules football]] competition played during the winter of 1871. The season consisted of matches between football clubs in the colony of Victoria. The [[Carlton Football Club]] was the premier club for the season.

==1871 season==
Four clubs participated in senior football during the 1870 season: [[Albert Park Football Club (VFA)|Albert-park]], {{AFL Car}}, {{AFL Mel}} and South Yarra.

The formal practice of senior clubs playing matches ''at odds'' against junior clubs was established during the season. In matches played at odds, the senior team fielded fifteen players and the junior team fielded twenty players. Matches played at odds were quite competitive: the premier club Carlton was unbeaten at even strength against senior clubs, but lost two of five matches played at odds. Three metropolitan junior clubs – Collingwood, Richmond&lt;!-- NOTE: both are different clubs to the modern professional clubs bearing the same names --&gt; and Carlton United – played against the senior clubs during the year. Senior clubs also played matches against provincial clubs Ballarat (at odds) and {{AFL Gee}} (even strength) during the year.&lt;ref name="review1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="review2" /&gt;

During the 1871 season, the senior clubs competed in specific matches for the Challenge Cup; and, separately, a premier team was selected based on all matches during the season, including Challenge Cup matches.

===Challenge Cup===
The Challenge Cup which South Yarra had put up for contest at the start of the 1870 season was returned by Albert-park to South Yarra at the end of the year, following the [[1870 Victorian football season#Challenge Cup|dispute]] over whether or not Albert-park had formally won it.

South Yarra opted to put the trophy up for contest again in 1871. Albert-park declined to contest it, although it continued to play senior games against the other clubs. The remaining clubs – Carlton, Melbourne and South Yarra – decided that each club would play the others three times during the season, and the top two would play a single playoff match for the Cup. 

This meant that the Cup was being contested in a league-type competition, and by traditional definitions was no longer a Challenge Cup with a perpetual holder. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=684|author=|date=3 June 1871|volume=X|issue=270|title=The Challenge Cup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the three Carlton-Melbourne matches were postponed by four weeks due to rain, while the two unplayed Carlton-South Yarra matches were scratched as they would have had no effect on the outcome.

With this victory in the Grand Final (the first of its kind in history), Carlton claimed undisputed and permanent ownership of the South Yarra Challenge Cup. &lt;ref name="review1"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|date=21 October 1871|title=Retrospect of the season|author=Fair Play|page=524|issue=290|volume=XI|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premiership===
In addition to winning the Challenge Cup, Carlton was adjudged premiers for the season, and Melbourne were runners-up. 

The two clubs were the dominant senior clubs in the colony, and the premiership was mostly determined based on the win-loss record in matches between the two: their four matches, including the Challenge Cup Grand Final, yielded one win for Carlton, two draws, and one disputed match (claimed as a win by Melbourne and as a draw by Carlton).&lt;ref name="review1" /&gt; 

Albert-park was third, having failed to defeat Carlton or Melbourne, but having beaten South Yarra (winless since 1868 in senior matches) during the year.&lt;ref name="review2"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|date=28 October 1871|title=Retrospect of the season|author=Fair Play|page=557|issue=291|volume=XI|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlton's and Melbourne's overall records as reported at each club's annual meeting in 1872 (reporting different results for the disputed match between the teams) are given below. The Senior results include the Challenge Cup final.

The '''2nd [[Asian Beach Games]]''' were held in [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Oman]] from 8 December 2010 to 16 December 2010. The opening ceremony was held in the [[Al-Musannah Sports City, Muscat|Al-Musannah Sports City]], [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]].

==Emblem==
The relation between the Omani people and the sea is legendary. Throughout history, they were pioneers in crossing the seas and oceans, and played a significant role in the maritime and shipbuilding history. The 18th century witnessed the arrival of the vessel "Sohar" to the City of [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]] (China), establishing once more the Omani maritime supremacy.

The logo design is derived from such splendid historical inputs, by embodying the simplest forms of the elements. The logo reflects the relation between the people of Oman and the rest of the worlds, especially with the people of Asia, by hosting the shining sun of Asia in Muscat, projecting a better future for the Asian sports, aided by the ship that will carry it to its international and continental sports destinations.

The strong and high waves under the sail provide the logo with solidity, vitality and sustainability and challenges, as represented by the flood of competitors in the various games, hosted in the high seas, and at the same time, touching the attractive Omani beaches, giving the local dimension of the nature of the beach games' tournament.

The expressions under the beach are colored by the bright colors of the Omani flag, expressing the devotion of the Omani people to their deep-rooted customs and traditions, expressed in the complete harmony of the elements.

==Development==
[[File:2nd asian beach games mascot.jpg|thumb|right|15opx|Al-Jebel ([[tahr]]), Al-Reeh ([[houbara bustard|houbara]]) and Al-Med ([[green turtle]]), the official mascot]]

After each team played each other twice (once at home and once away), the top four teams qualified for the semi-finals, with the winners of those matches meeting in the Grand Final.&lt;ref name=SCORE112&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.netballscoop.com/old/forums/topic/znsl-squads-2014/index.html|work=Netball Scoop Archive|date=13 January 2014|title=2014 Zeo Netball Superleague}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SCORE2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scoreboard.com/en/netball/united-kingdom/superleague-2014/|title=Netball: Superleague 2014 Results|work=scoreboard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''BBC African Footballer of the Year''' (previously known as the '''BBC African Sports Star of the Year''' and the '''BBC African Sports Personality of the Year''') is an annual award given to the best [[Africa]]n footballer of the year as voted by the [[BBC]] radio listeners. Voting is done via [[SMS]] and [[online]].

==History==
Initially a sports award, the inaugural winner was [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]'s [[Abedi Pele]] in 1992. The only non-footballers to win the award was track and field athlete [[Frankie Fredericks]] in 1993, and long-distance track and road running athlete [[Haile Gebrselassie]] in 1998. The [[Zambia national football team]] were posthumous winners of the award in 1994, following the [[1993 Zambia national football team plane crash|plane crash in the Atlantic Ocean]] a year previous. The award became centred around football from 2001 onwards, [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]]'s [[Patrick M'Boma]] was the last person to win it as a sports award.

[[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]'s [[Nwankwo Kanu]] and [[Jay-Jay Okocha]], as well as the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]]'s [[Yaya Touré]], are the only players to win the award more than once, with two wins.

Locals have nicknamed ''Magic Carpet Ride'' as '''''The Cardiff Kook''''', a pejorative name popularized by the local surfing community.&lt;ref name=Dougherty2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=AP1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rodgers2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sifuentes2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hood2010 /&gt; 

== History ==
The sculpture was commissioned by the Cardiff Botanical Society at a cost of approximately [[United States dollar|$]]120,000.&lt;ref name="Showley2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lau2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2007" /&gt; It was installed in 2007 at the entrances to the [[San Elijo State Beach]] campground on [[Coast Highway 101]].&lt;ref name="Dougherty2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2007" /&gt;  The $92,000 construction cost was raised by the Botanical Society, with the $30,000 installation funded by the city of Encinitas.&lt;ref name="Perry2007" /&gt; The sculpture's base also included plaques listing names of the project's major donors.  [http://www.publicartinpublicplaces.info/magic-carpet-ride-or-the-cardiff-kook-2007-by-matthew-antichevich ''Magic Carpet Ride''/''The Cardiff Kook''] is registered and archived by [[Public Art in Public Places]].

The sculpture was intended to depict a surfer performing a "(backside) floater", but the Botanical Society's budget could not cover the cost of an additional water/wave component.&lt;ref name="UPI1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horn2010" /&gt; Antichevich was chosen from more than 50 bidders on the commission.&lt;ref name="Horn2010" /&gt; His original design was for a female surfer on a breaking wave, which also exceeded the budget, and the Botanical Society chose an image of a male surfer on a granite plinth that halved the amount of required bronze.&lt;ref name="Kaye2007" /&gt; Other proposed designs were discussed with the Botanical Society, including the figure of professional surfer [[Rob Machado]] and a surfer on a longboard.&lt;ref name="Kaye2007" /&gt; According to Antichevich and to Michael Ames Clark (then-chairman of the Botanical Society's selection committee), the sculpture represented the joy and awkwardness of a young boy learning how to surf, in acknowledgement of the area's attraction to novice surfers.&lt;ref name="Dougherty2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horn2010" /&gt;

== Public response ==
The San Diego Architectural Foundation, in its annual "Orchids &amp;amp; Onions" awards for the best and worst architecture of the year, awarded the ''Magic Carpet Ride'' an Onion rating in 2007.&lt;ref name=Showley2007 /&gt; The nickname of ''The Cardiff Kook'' comes from derogatory surfer slang for a "wannabe" surfer, and reflects the low opinion that local surfers had of the sculpture.&lt;ref name=Dougherty2010 /&gt; The sculpture was criticized by surfers for its unrealistic depiction of a surfer. Other critics maintained that the feet were positioned incorrectly, the hands were odd in appearance, the figure was too thin and effeminate, and that as a whole it resembled the figure of a novice surfer about to fall off his board (as the artist intended) rather than that of a more experienced surfer.&lt;ref name=Hood2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaye2007 /&gt;

The early criticism surprised both the Botanical Society and artist Matthew Antichevich,&lt;ref name=Perry2007 /&gt; who stated that he did not expect the piece to be as widely misunderstood as it was upon its unveiling.&lt;ref name=Kaye2007 /&gt; The original models for the sculpture included a wave component, and Antichevich stated that if the wave had been included, the figure's surfing stance would have been better understood.&lt;ref name=Kaye2007 /&gt; Antichevich also noted that it was impossible, while creating the sculpture, to look at its hands from the necessary angles, since he "wasn't working 16 feet in the air".&lt;ref name=Horn2010 /&gt; At the sculpture's installation, Deputy Mayor Jerome Stocks defended the piece and answered critics with "Well, you go raise your own 90,000 dollars and put up a statue that you like.".&lt;ref name=Fitzsimmons2007 /&gt; After its early criticisms, the sculpture has evolved into a humorous landmark attracting frequent "costuming" efforts. The popularity of ''The Cardiff Kook'' has led to its own [https://goo.gl/maps/eGJveMHdbD32 Google Maps feature listing], and themed community events, such as "The Cardiff Kook Costume 5K &amp; 10K Run."

== Alterations to ''Magic Carpet Ride / The Cardiff Kook'' ==
[[Image:Cardiff Kook - FInd a Cure.jpg|thumb|right|The statue dressed in honor of [[National Breast Cancer Awareness Month]]]]
The sculpture began to attract pranksters who dressed the surfer in various attire, costumes, even with extended backdrops, which at times approached vandalism.&lt;ref name=Dougherty2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hood2010 /&gt;  The list of such pranks is extensive, often coordinated with current events: a pink pleated skirt, bikini top and [[lucha libre]] wrestling mask;&lt;ref name=Davis2007 /&gt; a [[Zorro]] costume;&lt;ref name="10News1" /&gt; a pumpkin head (at [[Halloween]]);&lt;ref name="10News1" /&gt; a [[Santa Claus]] hat (at [[Christmas]]);&lt;ref name="10News1" /&gt; a full [[Uncle Sam]] costume for [[United States Independence Day]];&lt;ref name="10News1" /&gt; the [[hooding|hood]] of the prisoner on a box [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|photograph from Abu Ghraib prison]];&lt;ref name=Perry2007 /&gt; a clown costume;&lt;ref name="10News2" /&gt; a [[loincloth]] and surrounded by a [[prehistoric]] setting while being snatched up by a sculpted [[pterodactyl]] in flight;&lt;ref name="Horn2011" /&gt; and a [[papier mâché]] statue of a [[shark]] about to swallow up the surfer from beneath.&lt;ref name=Rodgers2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hood2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name="10News1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="10News2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="10News3" /&gt;

The shark costume was one of two prank additions to the sculpture performed by local artist Eric Hardtke, himself a sculptor who works in bronze and stone, and accomplices.&lt;ref name=Dougherty2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Horn2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name="10News4" /&gt; The first was a 2009 addition next to the statue of a wave crashing down over the ''Kook'', carrying a wire mesh outline of another surfer about to knock the ''Kook'' off his board.&lt;ref name=Horn2010 /&gt; This wave still exists, since it was removed undamaged by city employees, and is stored at the ranch of Paul Ecke, a local grower of [[poinsettia]]s.&lt;ref name=Dougherty2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Horn2010 /&gt; It is constructed of wood, paper, and [[chicken wire]], and Hardtke stated that "It was to make the point that you could make a better sculpture for less money.".&lt;ref name=Dougherty2010 /&gt;

The second alteration to the ''Kook'' by Hardtke was the shark.&lt;ref name=Horn2010 /&gt; This 15 foot work was made of papier mâché over a wooden frame, and estimated by Hardtke to have consumed $450 and two weeks.&lt;ref name=Dougherty2010 /&gt; It was constructed in two halves, which were then sealed together around the ''Kook'' using foam sealant that was moulded to resemble ocean spray coming down off the flanks of the shark.&lt;ref name=Rodgers2010 /&gt; It was installed in the early morning, around 04:00, of 2010-07-24&lt;ref name=Dougherty2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=AP1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rodgers2010 /&gt; by Hardtke and some two dozen friends, and had been presaged over the preceding few days by the appearance of similarly constructed shark fins, positioned across the street from the statue and gradually moved closer to the ''Kook'' over a period of days, to imply a shark drawing close underwater to the ''Kook''.&lt;ref name=Dougherty2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rodgers2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sifuentes2010 /&gt; $400 in diverted employee time was used to clean up the shark.&lt;ref name=Horn2010 /&gt; Unlike the wave, the shark was damaged when it was removed by four city public works employees,&lt;ref name=Sifuentes2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Horn2010 /&gt; who took 10 minutes to split it apart using hand saws in the morning of 2010-07-26&lt;ref name="10News4" /&gt; and two hours overall to remove it.&lt;ref name=Sifuentes2010 /&gt;

Hardtke himself was not critical of the ''Kook'', and considers it a fair representation of average surfers, saying that "I'm sure I look like that. That's why everybody is so down on it. They like to think they don't look like that, but they do.".&lt;ref name=Dougherty2010 /&gt;

===City officials' reaction===
While such pranks are officially discouraged by Encinitas mayor Dan Dalager and city authorities, it is unofficially acknowledged that the sculpture's repeated costuming or vandalism is a boost to Cardiff's tourist trade.&lt;ref name=Dougherty2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Horn2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name="10News2" /&gt; Antichevich regards the vandalism as an insult to his work.&lt;ref name="10News1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="10News4" /&gt; No legal action has been taken against such vandals,&lt;ref name=Hood2010 /&gt; because no damage has been done to the sculpture itself.&lt;ref name=Dougherty2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hood2010 /&gt; It does not cost the city extra to clean up the various defacements, but it does divert time from tasks that city employees could otherwise be doing.&lt;ref name=Horn2010 /&gt; Mayor Dalager has stated that, while he personally likes the attention that this gives to the sculpture, he does not want the city to be having to divert city time and money away from the city's real problems.&lt;ref name=Sifuentes2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hood2010 /&gt; Deputy [[city manager]] Richard Phillips concurred, comparing the vandalism of the ''Kook'' to school pranksters dressing up a school's mascot, stating that "it gets old" and that city time and money could be better spent fixing potholes than cleaning up pranks.&lt;ref name=Hood2010 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2334">'''Corde lisse''' is an aerial [[circus (performing art)|circus]] skill or act that involves [[acrobatics]] on a vertically hanging rope. The name is [[French (language)|French]] for "smooth rope".

== Description ==

''Corde lisse'' moves are normally a combination of held postures and drops using a rope that hangs from the ceiling. These ropes are normally made from soft cotton about 30-35mm thick. The technique is closely related to both [[aerial silks|silks]], (another aerial circus skill performed on one or two long strips of strong fabric, often in bright colours), and [[Spanish web]]. It requires great skill and strength. Performers do not have any kind of safety net or safety line, relying on their own strength and ability to prevent a fall.

It is possible for two (or more) people to perform on the same rope, although more than two is rare. The performers can hang off each other or be at different heights on the rope.

The most famous use of aerial [[circus skills]] such as these has been for the [[BBC]]'s test-card. 
[[Cirque du Soleil]] also uses corde lisse, aerial silks and [[trapeze]] in some of their shows.
There are many schools and circus centers that teach rope throughout the world. 

== Corde lisse skills ==

There is no single naming convention for the skills on a corde lisse. Below is a list of names of moves, some of which are similar to the gymnastic equivalent, or which are a partial description of the move (e.g. double foot tie). This is by no means a complete list, as people are discovering and inventing new moves all the time. 

===Some solo moves===

* Arabesque
* Basic upside-down hang
* Basqules
* Big knot 
* Hip wrap knot
* Front flip
* Horizontal flip
* Crochet
* Crucifixion
* Dive
* Double foot tie
* Fan
* Hang
* Hip key
* Knee lock
* Knee lock slide
* Lean out
* Leg wraps (same and opposite side, left and right leg)
* Loop
* One arm hang
* Piston
* Rope climb (up and down)
* Salto
* Skip drop
* Spider
* Tempo swing
* Beats
* Windmills
* Flag

== Overview ==
By 1995, there have been three professional football clubs based in Seoul: [[Seongnam FC|Ilhwa Chunma]], [[FC Seoul|LG Cheetahs]] and [[Jeju United FC|Yukong Elephants]]. [[K League|Korea Professional Football League]] wanted to spread football popularity nationally and secure football-specific stadiums for bidding of [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. In order to achieve this goal, Korea Professional Football League and [[Blue House]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ikfhs.tistory.com/entry/서울연고공동화정책|title=일화 유공 LG, 내년에 서울연고 없어 |language=Korean |publisher=[[Best Eleven|Monthly Football]] |date=December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=서울 한지붕 세가족 일화 LG 유공 "내년엔 모두 서울 떠난다"|last=Lee|first=Young-kyu|date=1995-11-06|work=Sports Seoul|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=6|trans-title=Seoul Family Ilhwa, LG, Yukong "All Leaving Seoul Next Year"}}&lt;/ref&gt; forced all three clubs in Seoul to move to other cities. The intention was to compensate for the decreased number of home cities under the new system.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=9gYjBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=complete+region+base+k+league+1995&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-kxcuKGPe6&amp;sig=bQCPNSUZWmKPI7hY6ntg1DgW3SU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBioCYtbDSAhULxWMKHRv6CmgQ6AEIMTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=complete%20region%20base%20k%20league%201995&amp;f=false|title=The Sports Business in The Pacific Rim: Economics and Policy|last=Lee|first=Young Hoon|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=9783319100371|location=|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not proceeded smoothly with the affected clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newslibrary.naver.com/viewer/index.nhn?articleId=1995121300289119009&amp;editNo=5&amp;printCount=1&amp;publishDate=1995-12-13&amp;officeId=00028&amp;pageNo=19&amp;printNo=2423&amp;publishType=00010|title=Naver News Library - 일화·LG·유공"서울 포기못해"|last=|first=|date=1995-12-13|work=The Hankyoreh|access-date=2017-02-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|trans-title=Ilhwa, LG, Yukong,"Can't give up Seoul"}}&lt;/ref&gt; K League offered them a condition that they can move back to Seoul. If a club among them build a [[football-specific stadium]] in Seoul, the club will get the priority to return to Seoul. Then all three clubs agreed to move.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Relocation details ==
This policy brought resistances from each clubs. In October 1995, Yukong threatened K League that they will dissolve the club if they have to move out of Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fntoday.co.kr/bbs/list.html?table=bbs_219&amp;idxno=89195&amp;page=2&amp;total=578&amp;sc_area=N&amp;sc_word=||title=줏대없는 프로연맹 이사회 |language=Korean  |publisher=Sport Seoul|date=October 22, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1995, K League announced that if the clubs don't accept the decision, they will be excluded from the K League.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://newslibrary.naver.com/viewer/index.nhn?articleId=1995110900289118017&amp;editNo=5&amp;printCount=1&amp;publishDate=1995-11-09&amp;officeId=00028&amp;pageNo=18&amp;printNo=2392&amp;publishType=00010 |title= 프로축구 지역연고 먼길인가 |language=Korean  |publisher=[[The Hankyoreh]]|date=November 9, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the plan was announced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=9gYjBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=Decentralization+policy+in+K+League&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-kxcsNMN84&amp;sig=goZvvBmgcO0RZUuXDI3JIm1QmCk&amp;hl=ko&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwioo4yi0avSAhVBkpQKHUdxBzoQ6AEIMzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Decentralization%20policy%20in%20K%20League&amp;f=false|title=The Sports Business in The Pacific Rim: Economics and Policy|language= |publisher= |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; many [[List of cities in South Korea|city governments]] hoped to attract these clubs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=K League 30th Anniversary|first=|publisher=K League|year=2013|isbn=978-89-963178-4-5|location=Seoul, South Korea|page=178|pages=|quote=|via=|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yukong Elephants ===

The club decided to use [[Mokdong Stadium|Seoul Mokdong Stadium]] as their temporary home ground until the construction of Bucheon Stadium to be completed. The club changed its name to '''Bucheon Yukong''' as a part of the policy on January 4, 1996.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
From 1996, K League started ''Complete Home and Away system (Single City)'' as a result.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

After the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Korea Football Association needed to pay [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] 25 billion [[Korean won|KRW]] as their share of the construction of Seoul World Cup Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=111&amp;oid=011&amp;aid=0000003351|title=서울 프로축구팀 창단의 조건|access-date=2017-03-02|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; KFA wanted to find a new club in Seoul and let the club to pay the whole share, but it didn't happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=028&amp;aid=0000019077|title=[프로축구]서울FC가 보고 싶다|access-date=2017-03-03|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seoul Metropolitan Government understood that potential investment on a new Seoul club had not made due to the amount of the share, they agreed to cut 10 billion [[Korean won|KRW]] in the way of sponsoring the new team with the same amount of money.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sports.news.naver.com/general/news/read.nhn?oid=001&amp;aid=0000446058|title=&lt;프로축구 서울연고팀 창단 '급물살'&gt;|access-date=2017-03-03|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, KFA agreed to pay 10 billion KRW of their share to reduce the burden to a new Seoul club, leaving only 5 billion KRW to pay.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the meantime, Anyang LG Cheetahs declared their interest in moving to Seoul and Seoul Metropolitan Government welcomed it, though KFA prioritized the foundation of a new club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sports.news.naver.com/general/news/read.nhn?oid=020&amp;aid=0000219469|title=[프로축구]해법 못찾는 서울축구팀|access-date=2017-03-03|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But many candidate companies (including [[KT Corporation]] and [[Kumho Asiana Group]]), which received proposal from KFA and K League, refused to found a new Seoul-based club.{{Citation needed|reason=Lack of Citation|date=March 2017}}

On 6 February 2004, K League committee officially allowed the existing K League club's move to Seoul and sent relocation proposal to all K League clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=001&amp;oid=032&amp;aid=0000052125|title=프로축구 지방구단 서울입성 길열렸다|access-date=2017-03-03|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korea Football Association declared that if an existing club wants to move to Seoul, they need to pay 15 billion won, due to the KFA's 10 billion KRW offer was only under the condition of foundation of a new club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sports.news.naver.com/general/news/read.nhn?oid=028&amp;aid=0000044218|title=축구협, 안양 엘지 서울입성 ‘태클’|access-date=2017-03-03|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

11 February 2004, [[Busan I'Cons]] declared their interest in being a new Seoul club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sports.news.naver.com/general/news/read.nhn?oid=028&amp;aid=0000044924|title=부산 아이콘스도 서울로 연고 이전 신청|access-date=2017-03-03|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days later, KFA cut the share to pay to a half, 7.5 billion KRW, with a prospect of a new Seoul club in future to pay the other half.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sports.news.naver.com/general/news/read.nhn?oid=020&amp;aid=0000225887|title=프로축구연맹 "서울입성 75억만 내라"|access-date=2017-03-03|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2004, Busan I'Cons officially retreated their interest and Anyang LG Cheetahs declared to be the new Seoul football club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sports.news.naver.com/general/news/read.nhn?oid=001&amp;aid=0000587503|title=프로축구 부산, 연고지 잔류..LG 서울 입성|access-date=2017-03-03|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glanford Park''' is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Scunthorpe]], [[Lincolnshire]], England, and is the current home of [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]].

Opened in 1988 at a construction cost of £2.5&amp;nbsp;million, Glanford Park was the first new purpose-built [[Football League]] stadium to be built in England for 33 years, since [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] moved to [[Roots Hall]] in 1955.

The stadium is Scunthorpe’s second ground, with the Iron having previously played at the [[Old Showground]] from 1899 to 1988. The ground’s record attendance was set at 9,077 for a [[EFL Cup|Carling Cup]] Third Round tie against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 22 September 2010.

==History==
Scunthorpe United originally played at the Old Showground, which was located towards the centre of the town at the junction of Doncaster Road and Henderson Avenue. In the wake of the [[Bradford City stadium fire|Bradford City disaster]] of 1985, it was determined that substantial improvements would have to be made to the Old Showground in order for it to meet new regulations, improvements which the club could not afford. Ultimately it was decided that the best course of action was to relocate to a new out of town site, with the sale of the land occupied by the Old Showground being used to raise much needed revenue for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scunthorpe United F.C. – A Pictorial History ~ 1899–2006|last=Staff|first=John|publisher=Yore Publications|year=2006|isbn=0 9552949 2 4|location=|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the club relocated, the Old Showground was demolished and replaced by a [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] supermarket, which was subsequently sold to [[Sainsbury's]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scunthorpe-united.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10442~875636,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703202730/http://www.scunthorpe-united.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10442~875636,00.html |dead-url=yes |archivedate=3 July 2008 |title=OLD SHOW GROUND |publisher=[[Scunthorpe United F.C.]] |date=12 June 2007 |accessdate=23 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began during 1987 on a site located on the outskirts of Scunthorpe, close to the start of the [[M181 motorway]] and approximately 1.5 miles West of the Old Showground. The ground was fully completed prior to the commencement of the [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]] season and was officially opened at the start of the season by [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]]. Upon its completion, it was the first new [[The Football League|Football League]] stadium in England for 33 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/doncaster/5230958.stm|title=Grounds for Concern|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|date=31 December 2006|accessdate=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glanford Park originally opened with a capacity of 11,190, both of the goal-ends being standing terraces, however this capacity was later reduced to its current value of 9,088 in 1991.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iron-bru.co.uk/glanford-park/|title=Glanford Park|last=|first=|date=|website=Iron-Bru.net|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Glanford Park was derived from its funding by the then [[Glanford|Glanford Borough Council]], before North Lincolnshire became a [[unitary authority]].

For all but one of its first 17 seasons ([[1999–2000 Scunthorpe United F.C. season|1999–2000]]), the stadium staged fourth tier football prior to Scunthorpe’s promotion to [[Football League|League One]] in 2005, since when they have appeared in either League One or the [[Football League Championship]] for all but one season ([[2013–14 Scunthorpe United F.C. season|2013–14]]).

Premier League side [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] visited Glanford Park on 24 January 2010, in the [[2009–10 FA Cup#Fourth Round Proper|FA Cup Fourth Round]]. City won the match 4–2, which saw [[Robinho]] score his final goal in English football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article7000927.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first1=Oliver | last1=Kay | first2=Glanford | last2=Park | title=Robinho leaves a lasting impression at Manchester City | date=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record attendance is 9,077 for a 5–2 loss against Manchester United in the League Cup on 22 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scunthorpe-united.co.uk/page/News/0,,10442~2162325,00.html |title=IRON BREAK ATTENDANCE RECORD |publisher=Scunthorpe United F.C. |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=22 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322053422/http://www.scunthorpe-united.co.uk/page/News/0,,10442~2162325,00.html |archivedate=22 March 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record attendance for a Football League game stands at 8,921 for a 2–1 win over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the Championship, coming on 20 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/newcastle-united/6389229/Scunthorpe-United-2-Newcastle-United-1-match-report.html|title=Scunthorpe United 2 Newcastle United 1: match report|last=Stewart|first=Rob|date=20 October 2009|website=The Telegraph|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and facilities==
[[File:Football and fast food - geograph.org.uk - 847925.jpg|thumb|
The gated archway at the entrance to Glanford Park on Jack Brownsword Way.
]]
Glanford Park is a relatively simple affair, consisting of four single-tier stands of equal height, three of which are all seated. Although there is no seating in any of the four corners between stands the ground is still fully enclosed, with the rear wall and roof of each stand simply being extended to meet in the corners. Since February 2011, the south-west corner of the ground has been completely filled-in with the construction of the ‘Legends Lounge’, with the other three simply containing refreshment kiosks.

===SPB Stand===
[[File:Glanford Park 4 - geograph-2152845.jpg|thumb|View towards the Clugston Stand (named 'Grove Wharf Stand' at time of photograph).]]
The SPB stand (formerly the Scunthorpe Telegraph Stand) is the West side stand, and is the ground's main stand. It runs along the entire length of the pitch and is fully seated.

The two southernmost blocks of seating are marketed as the club's family area. To the rear of the stand are the club’s various executive suites. These include a restaurant which is open throughout the week, a set of executive boxes, the [[Ian Botham|Sir Ian Botham]] Executive Lounge and the Legends Lounge, which occupies the south-west corner. Members of the media are allocated a small area of seating at the rear of the stand, and a television gantry is also positioned within the roof space.

The players’ tunnel is located centrally within this stand, with the team dugouts being located on either side of the opening. The dressing rooms are naturally all located within this stand.

Other facilities located within this stand include the club’s main offices, ticket office, club shop and sports injury clinic.

===Britcon Stand===
[[File:Glanford Park 2016.jpg|thumb|View from the Britcon Stand.]]
The name of this stand is the most frequently changing. It is much more commonly known as the "Doncaster Road End" among supporters, or even simpler, the "Donny Road End" or “DRE”. This stand is the only terraced stand at Glanford Park, and typically houses the more vocal supporters.

The club’s popular bar, ‘The Iron Bar’ is located below this stand and is open on match days prior to kick-off and during half-time.

The Britcon Stand was due to be fitted with seating after the [[2010–11 Scunthorpe United F.C. season|2010–11]] season due to Football League regulations that all standing areas must be made seating following three seasons in the Championship, however Scunthorpe United were subsequently relegated, reprieving the terrace for the time being.

===Clugston Stand===
The Clugston Stand (formerly the Grove Wharf Stand prior to the start of the 2012-13 season) is the East stand of the ground, and houses seated home supporters. Disabled seating is available at the front of  the stand in four allocated bays. The Clugston Stand now also features a can bar and a food outlet in the void beneath the seating, which along with additional toilet facilities was installed at a cost of £100,000 in 2006.

The stadium’s match day control room is located at the rear of this stand.

===AMS Stand===
[[File:Caparomerchantbar.jpg|thumb|Away supporters in the AMS Stand.]]The AMS Stand (also known as the South Stand or “Railway End”) houses away supporters, with a maximum capacity of 1,678. Extra away seating can be made available for away fans if required by sectioning off the corner of the Clugston Stand closest to the AMS Stand, however this is only usually done for games such as local derbies. A bar for visiting fans is positioned below this stand.

The AMS Stand was originally a terrace much the same as the Britcon Stand when the stadium was first built, however it was later decided that in the interests of safety that this end should be converted to seating only. This conversion was made during 1991, with the original blue seats being sourced from [[Aston Villa F.C.]] as a part of a deal involving the sale of defender Neil Cox to the West Midlands club.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These seats were replaced with newer claret-coloured seats prior to the [[2007–08 Scunthorpe United F.C. season|2007–08]] season.
== International matches ==
Glanford Park has hosted several international matches during its lifetime. The first international match to be played at the stadium came on 10 September 1991, with [[England national under-21 football team|England U21]] emerging as 2–1 victors against [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany U21]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.11v11.com/matches/england-v-germany-10-september-1991-258387/|title=England v Germany, 10 September 1991|last=|first=|date=|website=11v11.com|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that date Glanford Park has played host to several [[England national under-19 football team|England U19]], [[England national under-17 football team|England U17]] and [[England national under-16 football team|England U16]] games, as well as a match between [[Portugal national under-17 football team|Portugal U17]] and [[Australia national under-17 soccer team|Australia U17]] on 25 August 2010, in which Portugal ran out as 4–3 winners.

==Future development==
In the ''[[Scunthorpe Telegraph]]'' on 14 December 2006 it was announced that the club were looking to expand the Doncaster Road End of the stadium. Potential improvements mentioned included a second tier and expansion of the club's restaurant. In announcing the plan for expansion, the club's [[chairman]] Steven Wharton acknowledged that they were not currently filling the stadium to capacity on a regular basis, but added that he was preparing for a future situation where a larger capacity could be required. This would have been the first major redevelopment of any stand at Glanford Park since its opening, however these plans were later shelved.

Under government regulations the club would have been required to convert the Doncaster Road End to seating if relegation from the Championship had been avoided in 2010–11. In an effort to overturn this ruling, supporters launched a Keep Scunthorpe Standing campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Iron fans making a stand against Ipswich | url = http://www.scunthorpeunited-mad.co.uk/news/tmnw/iron_fans_making_a_stand_against_ipswich_561595/index.shtml | publisher = Iron-Bru.net | date =23 September 2010 | accessdate =23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club revealed revised expansion details in September 2010, with plans to add a three-level building behind the current terrace to include a larger supporters' bar, club shop and ticket office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Cantilevered DRE is being considered | url = http://www.scunthorpeunited-mad.co.uk/news/tmnw/cantilevered_dre_is_being_considered_564304/index.shtml | publisher = Iron-Bru.net | date =29 September 2010 | accessdate =29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capacity of the ground would not have increased; this is due to the change from a terrace to a seating area. As it so happened, the Iron were relegated from the Championship at the end of the 2010–11 season and so these plans never came to fruition.

In January 2014, it was revealed that Scunthorpe United proposed a move to a brand new stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stadiumdb.com/news/2014/01/new_design_scunthorpe_united_stadium|title=New design: Scunthorpe United Stadium – StadiumDB.com|website=stadiumdb.com|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projected cost of the project was £18&amp;nbsp;million and the new stadium was intended to have a capacity of 12,000. The new stadium was intended to integrate the stadium with 24/7 businesses, including a hotel, an office, training and catering facilities in order to maximize revenue for the club. It was further announced in July 2014 that the site of the new stadium was intended to form the focal point of the new 'Lincolnshire Lakes' development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/calendar/2014-07-30/iron-release-plans-for-new-stadium/|title=Iron release plans for new stadium|work=ITV News|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was planned for commencement during 2015-2016. Due to issues regarding procurement of the land for the new stadium and issues with one of the developers, the intended site of the new stadium was moved approximately {{convert|500|m|yd|order=flip}} to the south, and the construction start date was pushed back to some point in late 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk/new-site-identified-for-scunthorpe-united-stadium/story-30340785-detail/story.html|title=New site identified for Scunthorpe United stadium|last=Crute|first=Paul|date=18 May 2017|website=Scunthorpe Telegraph|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, Scunthorpe United confirmed that the proposal to relocate to the new stadium had been dropped, stating a new aim to instead redevelop and extend Glanford Park, thus securing the immediate future of the stadium for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/no-new-stadium-scunthorpe-united-687357|title=Scunthorpe United chairman Peter Swann says club will redevelop Glanford Park|date=26 October 2017|work=Scunthorpe Telegraph|accessdate=27 January 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women's artistic individual all-around''' competition at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] was held on August 15. at the [[Beijing National Indoor Stadium]].

For each competitor in the women's qualification, the scores&lt;ref&gt;Scoring in artistic gymnastics is based on two separate scores that are then combined in order to come to the final score.  The A score measures the difficulty of each element (and combinations of elements) within the routine, while the B score evaluates the performance, ie, the "execution, composition and artistry" of the routine. For further information, please see the [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; for all four apparatus were summed to give an all-around qualification score. The top 24 competitors moved on to the individual all-around final, though nations were limited to two competitors each even if more qualified. In the individual all-around final, each gymnast competed on each apparatus again. Only scores from the final were used to determine final rankings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">'''The Harrison Hoist''' is a [[netball]] manoeuvre in which one defender lifts another during a jump, in order to get more elevation, in an attempt to deflect a shot or as a form of [[goaltending]]. It was named after [[Northern Mystics]] defender [[Anna Harrison (netball player)|Anna Harrison]], who pulled off the move for the first time on 20 May 2012, during the Mystics' round 8 [[ANZ Championship]] match against the [[Melbourne Vixens]] in Melbourne. She was lifted first by [[Kayla Cullen]], then by young defender [[Jessica Moulds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dana |last= Johannsen |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10807188 |title=Dana Johannsen: Revolutionary hoist could change the game |publisher=The New Zealand Herald |date= 21 May 2012 |accessdate= 21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The move was first seen in the 1970s with Chris Stanton the first recognised performer, and more recently at the [[2011 Netball World Championships]], when it was used by the Singapore defenders in an attempt to intercept the ball, albeit unsuccessfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anz-championship.com/news/news.asp?nid=861 |title=The Jump That Changed The Game |publisher=ANZ Championship |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The move was very controversial and made the news in New Zealand and Australia, with many people questioning the legality and/or ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tensport.com.au/netball-the-chairlift-dan-ryan.htm |title=Netball Blogs |publisher=Tensport.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IFNA]] has said the move is legal, and umpires will not rule against it, although current rules forbid the touching of the net or rim while performing the hoist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10807391 |title=Netball: Harrison's hoist has been coming |publisher= The New Zealand Herald |date=21 May 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its unveiling, it was used several times throughout the season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nz.sports.yahoo.com/news/article/-/14932549/silver-ferns-air-harrison-hoist/ |title=Silver Ferns air Harrison hoist |publisher= Yahoo! New Zealand Sport |date=2012-09-23 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it wasn't as effective. It was attempted by several other teams and players, although it has only been successful once without Harrison, when her Mystics team mate [[Rachel Rasmussen]] lifted Kayla Cullen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anz-championship.com/news/a/mystics-regain-winning-ways/911 |title=Mystics regain winning ways |publisher=ANZ Championship |date=24 June 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been attempted several times throughout the international season, including by the Australian defenders, most notably in the [[2012 Fast5 Netball World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/netball-news/silver-ferns-beat-england-in-thrilling-fast5-final-5209435 |title=Silver Ferns beat England in thrilling Fast5 final |publisher=Television New Zealand |date=11 November 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6154">In [[biomechanics]], '''Hill's muscle model''' refers to either Hill's equations for [[Tetanic contraction|tetanized]] [[muscle contraction]] or to the 3-element model. They were derived by the famous [[physiologist]] [[Archibald Vivian Hill]].

==Equation to tetanized muscle==
This is a popular [[state equation]] applicable to [[skeletal muscle]] that has been stimulated to show [[Tetanic contraction]]. It relates [[stress (mechanics)|tension]] to velocity with regard to the internal [[thermodynamics]]. The equation is

:&lt;math&gt;\left(v+b\right)(F+a) = b(F_0+a)&lt;/math&gt;

where 
* &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the tension (or load) in the muscle
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of contraction
* &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum isometric tension (or load) generated in the muscle
* &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; coefficient of shortening heat
* &lt;math&gt;b=a\cdot v_0/F_0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum velocity, when &lt;math&gt;F=0&lt;/math&gt;

Although Hill's equation looks very much like the [[van der Waals equation]], the former has units of energy [[dissipation]], while the latter has units of [[energy]]. Hill's equation demonstrates that the relationship between F and v is [[Hyperbolic growth|hyperbolic]]. Therefore, the higher the load applied to the muscle, the lower the contraction velocity. Similarly, the higher the contraction velocity, the lower the tension in the muscle. This hyperbolic form has been found to fit the empirical constant only during [[Isotonic (exercise physiology)|isotonic contractions]] near resting length.&lt;ref name="Hill_1938"&gt;{{cite journal 
|author=Hill, A.V. 
|title=The heat of shortening and dynamics constants of muscles

The muscle tension decreases as the shortening velocity increases. This feature has been attributed to two main causes. The major appears to be the loss in tension as the cross bridges in the [[Sarcomere|contractile element]] and then reform in a shortened condition. The second cause appears to be the fluid viscosity in both the contractile element and the connective tissue. Whichever the cause of loss of tension, it is a [[viscous friction]] and can therefore be modeled as a fluid [[dashpot|damper]]

==Three-element model==
[[Image:Lengthtension.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Muscle length vs Force. In Hill's muscle model the active and passive forces are respectively &lt;math&gt;F_{CE}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{PE}&lt;/math&gt;.]]
[[Image:Hill muscle model.svg|150px|right|thumb|Hill's elastic muscle model. F: Force; CE: Contractile Element; SE: Series Element; PE: Parallel Element.]]

The '''three-element Hill muscle model''' is a representation of the muscle mechanical response. The model is constituted by a contractile element ('''CE''') and two [[non-linear]] [[Spring (device)|spring elements]], one in [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] ('''SE''') and another in parallel ('''PE'''). The active [[force]] of the contractile element comes from the force generated by the [[actin]] and [[myosin]] cross-bridges at the [[sarcomere]] level. It is fully extensible when inactive but capable of shortening when activated. The [[connective tissue]]s ([[fascia]], [[epimysium]], [[perimysium]] and [[endomysium]]) that surround the contractile element influences the muscle's force-length curve. The parallel element represents the passive force of these connective tissues and has a [[soft tissue]] mechanical behavior. The parallel element is responsible for the muscle passive behavior when it is [[stretched]], even when the contractile element is not activated. The series element represents the [[tendon]] and the intrinsic elasticity of the myofilaments. It also has a soft tissue response and provides energy storing mechanism.&lt;ref name="Fung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;{{cite journal

The net force-length characteristics of a muscle is a combination of the force-length characteristics of both active and passive elements. The forces in the contractile element, in the series element and in the parallel element, &lt;math&gt;F_{CE}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F_{SE}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{PE}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;F = F_{PE}+F_{SE} \quad \mathrm{and} \quad F_{CE}=F_{SE} \;.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, the muscle length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and the lengths &lt;math&gt;L_{CE}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_{SE}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_{PE}&lt;/math&gt; of those elements satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;L = L_{PE} \quad \mathrm{and} \quad L = L_{CE}+L_{SE} \;.&lt;/math&gt;

During [[Isometric exercise|isometric contractions]] the series elastic component is under tension and therefore is stretched a finite amount. Because the overall length of the muscle is kept constant, the stretching of the series element can only occur if there is an equal shortening of the contractile element itself.&lt;ref name="Fung"/&gt;

===Viscoelasticity===
Muscles present viscoelasticity, therefore a viscous damper may be included in the model, when the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of the [[Order (differential equation)|second-order]] [[critically damped]] twitch is regarded. One common model for muscular viscosity is an [[Exponentiation|exponential]] form damper, where
:&lt;math&gt;F_{D} = k(\dot{L}_{D})^a&lt;/math&gt;
is added to the model's global equation, whose &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; are constants.&lt;ref name="Fung"/&gt;

'''Homewood Field''' is the athletics stadium of the [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. It was built in 1906 and has an official capacity of 8,500 people. The name is taken, as is that of the entire campus, from the name of the estate of [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]]. Homewood Field is located on the northern border of the campus, and it is adjacent to the [[U.S. Lacrosse Hall of Fame]]. It serves as the home field for the university's [[college football|football]], [[soccer]], [[field hockey]] and [[field lacrosse|lacrosse]] teams.

It was also the home field for the professional lacrosse team, the [[Baltimore Bayhawks]], for the 2001 and 2003 [[Major League Lacrosse]] seasons. It hosted the Division I [[NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship]] in 1975, and will be the site for the 2016 Big Ten men's lacrosse tournament. The south grandstand is named for Conrad Gebelein (1884–1981), longtime music director at the university.

The '''International Blind Sports Federation''' ('''IBSA''') is a nonprofit organization founded 1981 in [[Paris]], [[France]]. IBSA's mission is to promote the full integration of [[Blindness|blind]] and partially sighted people in society through sport and to encourage people with a [[visual impairment]] to take up and practice sports. IBSA is a full and founding member of the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC).

IBSA is the international federation for several sports for people with a visual impairment, including three [[Paralympic]] sports ([[Paralympic association football|Paralympic association football]], [[Goalball]] and [[Judo]]), [[Powerlifting]], [[Ten-pin bowling]], [[Nine-pin bowling]], [[Torball]], [[Athletics (sport)Blind Football|Athletics]], [[Alpine skiing]], [[Biathlon]], [[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]], [[Shooting]], [[Archery]], [[Showdown (sport)|Showdown]], [[Nordic skiing]], and [[Cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibsasport.org/sports/|title=Sports|work=ibsasport.org|date=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBSA's showcase event is the [[IBSA World Championships and Games]], held every four years. The first games took place in 1998 in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] followed by the event in 2003 at [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]], Canada. the 3rd edition of the games was held in [[Sao Paulo]], [[Brazil]], in 2007 and the 2011 games took place in [[Antalya]], [[Turkey]].

In 2015, between May 8 and May 18, the 5th IBSA World Championships and Games was held in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] and included competitions in Powerlifting, Judo, Goalball, Football, Chess, Tenpin Bowling, Tandem Cycling, Swimming, Showdown and Athletics.

IBSA also organizes world and regional championships in many of its sports. Regional or continental championships are generally held in odd years, while world championships take place every four years in even years when there are no Paralympic Games.

'''KCB Rugby Club''' is a [[rugby union]] team based in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. It was formed in 1989 after the disbanding of Kenya Breweries RFC when their main sponsor, [[Kenya Breweries]], pulled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=History |url=http://kcbrfc.webatu.com/1_2_History.html |title=History » The Lions' Den - KCB Rugby Football Club |publisher=Kcbrfc.webatu.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year they joined the [[Kenya Cup]]. Their first match was against [[Impala RFC]] whom they beat 96-6. In 1994 the team was relegated to the [[Eric Shirley Shield]], however by 1996 they had regained their position in Kenya's top rugby league. The club now has a 2nd XV team which has performed well, winning the Mwamba Cup, and Eric Shirley Shield several times.

==History==

===The beginning===
The history of Kenya Commercial Bank Rugby Football Club cannot be told without that of [[Kenya Breweries]] Rugby Football Club, its forerunner. Kenya Breweries RFC was formed in 1983 when a few employees of the parent company Kenya Breweries Limited (KBL) who had played rugby for other clubs felt the need to start their own institutional side. Among the pioneer players were [[flanker (rugby union)|flanker]] Justus Mugaa M’mpwii who had featured for [[Mean Machine RFC]] and [[Mwamba RFC]] and the first captain D. Maina who had featured for [[Impala RFC]] at fly half.

The first training sessions took place in August 1983 at the [[Jamhuri High School]] in [[Nairobi]]. Many KBL employees who had never touched a rugby ball in their lives enthusiastically signed up to play for the team. Kenya Breweries RFC played their first ever match, a friendly against Barclays Bank RFC at the RFUEA grounds in October of the same year and made their first competitive appearance at the Jamhuri Sevens in December.

1984 saw the team join the [[Eric Shirley Shield]], the Kenyan second division rugby union league, earning promotion to the first division [[Kenya Cup]] in 1987. They would be relegated back to the Eric Shirley Shield in 1988 but returned to the Kenya Cup in 1989. The team received a jolt in February 1989 when the sponsor, KBL announced plans to disband a majority of its sports teams with the exception of its soccer and netball teams.

===The aftermath===
KBL’s decision threw the team into confusion. There were crucial decisions to be made with players wondering whether they would disperse and go their separate ways. A few players ended up at Barclays Bank RFC. Some joined to Mwamba RFC, only to end up at [[Nondescripts RFC]] after a short stay. Some players held the view that the KBL players should approach Mwamba RFC where they would be accommodated amicably, while other team members felt that they had built a strong bond that could see them approach institutions for sponsorship as a rugby entity.

Talks were held with many organizations but it was a meeting between hooker Hezekiah Jerome Ougo and Patrick Odanga, a former Mwamba and Kenya player who was an employee of Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) that bore fruit. Further talks followed leading to the formation of Kenya Commercial Bank RFC who were belatedly admitted in the 1989 Kenya Cup to take the place of the now defunct Kenya Breweries RFC.

The Club constitutionally changed its name from Kenya Commercial Bank Rugby Football Club (KCB RFC) to Kenya Commercial Bank Rugby Club (KCB RC) at the beginning of the 2010-2011 rugby season. The club dropped the word "Football" from its name after [[Kenya Rugby Football Union]], whom they are affiliated with, dropped theirs in the KRU [[constitution]] amended on 15 January 2010 and adopted on 26 February 2010.

===Current squad===

== Playing Kit ==
[[Image:KCB Rugby Club current KIT-2012.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Illustration showing the current playing kit of KCB Rugby Club.]]
KCB Rugby club playing kit has green as its main color. It is an adaptation from their sponsor, [[Kenya Commercial Bank]], who have light green as one of their corporate colors.

In the early days of the rugby club, the jersey had green, red and white stripes to portray the bank’s corporate colors. This was revised and when the bank’s corporate identity changed in both logo and color the adaptation was green as the dominant color followed by dark blue and then white.

The second tier side usually wears kit that is blue dominant in color. They also wear either blue or black shorts unlike the white shorts of the 1st tier side. Currently there is no real distinction in kits between the 1st and 2nd tier sides but, as per club tradition, the new kit of the season is donned by the 1st tier side.

Warm up jerseys are usually [[polo neck]] or round-neck [[t-shirts]] provided by Kenya Commercial Bank. The colors vary depending on the product being promoted by the bank's marketing department.

==Performance==
In 2004 and 2007, they won the [[Enterprise Cup]], they have also won the [[Kenya Cup]] 4 times, 3 of them between 2005-2007 and one in the 2014-15 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Honors |url=http://kcbrfc.webatu.com/1_8_Honors.html |title=Honors » The Lions' Den - KCB Rugby Football Club |publisher=Kcbrfc.webatu.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/sports/rugby/KCB%20Quins%20clash%20in%20rugby%20final%20/-/1106/900794/-/wghdxwz/-/index.html |title=Quins clash in rugby final |work=Daily Nation |location=Kenya |date=2010-04-16 |first=Ayumba |last=Ayodi |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''League Park''' was a [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] [[baseball]] park located in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], United States. It was the home of the [[Cincinnati Reds]] from 1884 through 1901.  The ballpark was on an asymmetrical block bounded by Findlay Street (south), Western Avenue (northeast, angling), York Street (north) and McLean Avenue (west).

The '''"Findlay and Western"''' intersection was the home field of the Reds from 1884 through June 24, 1970, when the team moved to [[Cinergy Field|Riverfront Stadium]].  The location of the [[infield|diamond]] and consequently the main [[grandstand]] seating area was shifted several times during the 86½ seasons the Reds played on the site.  League Park was actually the first of three parks to stand on the site:

:1884–1901: '''League Park'''
:1902–1911: '''[[Palace of the Fans]]'''
:1912–1970: '''Redland Field''', renamed '''[[Crosley Field]]''' in 1934

==History==
During the Cincinnati Reds' first two seasons, the club played at the [[Bank Street Grounds]]. Following the 1883 season, the Reds were forced to abandon the park, because the lease had been bought out from under them by the new Cincinnati entry in the one-year wonder called the [[Union Association]].

The Reds had to find a new location, and they found one less than a mile away from their old park, a few blocks to the southeast on Western Avenue, at the northwest corner of where Findlay Street intersected Western. Thus the Reds remained in the West End, and fans had only to traverse Western Avenue to see the team of their choice.

The new facility was variously called '''Cincinnati Base Ball Grounds''' (or '''Park'''), '''Western Avenue Grounds''', '''American Park''' (while in the AA), and then its most enduring pre-1912 name, '''League Park''' (beginning 1890). The small grandstand for the new park was built in the southeast corner of the block, tucked into the acute angle made by the intersection. Although the diamond would be moved back and forth between the southeast and the southwest corners several times, the little 1884 structure would be retained for 28 seasons, and would come in handy. However, it got off to a bad start. It was constructed hastily, and during the opening day game a portion of the stand collapsed, killing one spectator and injuring several others.

The park was also very short to right field, with balls hit over the right field fence counting only as a double, until additional land was acquired a few weeks into the season. This increased the distance to right by 50 feet and made the field regulation-sized.

[[Image:CincyDiagram.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Seating chart of the ballpark in 1884]]
The first game to be played at American Park was on April 9, 1884. It was an exhibition game against the then National League [[Cleveland Blues (NL)|Cleveland Blues]]. The Reds first official home opening day at American Park was on May 1, 1884 against their American Association rival the [[Columbus Buckeyes (minor league)|Columbus Buckeyes]]. Cincinnati lost that game 10-9 in heartbreaking fashion.

The season itself saw a good deal of competition between the Reds and the Unions. Although many called the Union the "Onion League" due to its lopsided distribution of talent, the Cincinnati Unions were a fairly strong team and drew fans away from the Reds. Once the Union folded, the Reds opted to remain at Findlay and Western, and would continue to do so for the better part of nine decades. Thus the Reds had the city to themselves in 1885.

Although the Reds were not participants in the 1885 [[World Series]], their ballpark was. The  contest, between the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870–89)|Chicago White Stockings]] of the NL and the [[St. Louis Browns (NL)|St. Louis Browns]] of the AA, staged some of its games at neutral sites. The Reds' ballpark was the site for the final two games of the Series, a disputed match that officially ended in a draw.

When the Reds returned to the [[National League]] in 1890, the name of the park would come to be known as League Park, in reference to the team's original and now current circuit. In those days, the National League was typically referred to in media as "the League", since there was only one "League" and (for ten years) one "Association".

[[Image:Cincy1894new.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Rebuilt ballpark in 1894]]
In 1894 the ballpark went through some major changes. The owner of the Reds, [[John Brush]], would build a brand new grandstand and add an [[amphitheater]]. In order to build a new grandstand he had the diamond shifted from the southeast corner (Findlay and Western) to the southwest corner (Findlay and McLean). Brush chose to retain the old seating as a right field pavilion. This would prove to be a wise decision.

The name of the ballpark was not changed. Because of the relocated diamond, some historians refer to it as League Park II. The center field area was painted black in 1895 to form a [[batter's eye]] screen. Some sources (such as Benson) claim this was the first such screen in baseball.

On May 28 1900, the ballpark caught on fire, burning the 1894 grandstand. The Reds considered moving to [[East End Park (Cincinnati)|East End Park]] where the short-lived "[[Cincinnati Kelly's Killers|Kelly's Killers]]" Association club had played in 1891. Instead, they opted to shift the diamond back to its original location in the southeast corner, reusing the original grandstand, which was not significantly harmed in the fire due to a gap between the two seating areas. They played a month's worth of games on the road, returning to their reconfigured home on June 28.

After a season and a half of playing in the charred ballpark, the Reds built what they expected to be a more permanent new grandstand, again in the southwest corner, retaining the original seating, and again with a gap between the seating areas that would prove fortuitous. The original seating had changed somewhat over time, as the middle section no longer sat higher than the rest, and the entire structure was roofed.

The look of the new grandstand was striking, and the owners named it [[Palace of the Fans]]. While the park was still referred to as League Park until 1911, the grandstand nickname is what the park has become known as today.

'''Liga III''' (also spelled '''Liga 3''') is the third level of the [[Romanian football league system]]. Its name was changed from '''Divizia C''' to '''Liga III''' before the start of the 2006-07 season.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cotidianul]], [http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=5279&amp;art=12730&amp;cHash=39408f2e10 ''Divizia A a fost mitraliată'' (The "A Division" was gunned down)], accessed on 3 February 2007  {{webarchive

==Current format==
Liga III has five parallel regional divisions, each with 16 teams.

==Promotion==
The winner of each series promotes directly to the [[Liga II]], in total 5 teams.

==Relegation==
The bottom two or three teams from each division are relegated at the end of the season to the [[Liga IV]]. From the 12th placed teams, another three are relegated. To determine these teams, separate standings are computed, using only the games played against clubs ranked 1st through 11th.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13053">'''Mallakhamba/Mallakhamb''' ([[Kannada language|Kannada]]: ಮಲ್ಲ ಕಂಬ'' malla-kamb'', [[Marathi language|Marathi]]: मल्लखांब ''malla-khamb'', [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: மல்லர் கம்பம் ''mallar-kambam'') is a traditional sport, originating from the [[Indian subcontinent]], in which a [[gymnast]] performs aerial [[yoga]] postures and [[wrestling]] grips in concert with a vertical stationary or hanging wooden pole, cane, or hanging rope. The word Mallakhamb also refers to the pole used in the sport.&lt;ref name=book1&gt;[https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=-3OBAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=mallkhamb&amp;dq=mallkhamb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiurPugi7nUAhUMr48KHaTqBSQ4FBDoAQgjMAE Games, Sports and Cultures, Noel Dyck, Bloomsbury Academic, 1 Jul 2000, pp.96]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=book5/&gt; The pole is usually made from [[Rosewood|Seesham (Indian Rosewood)]] polished with [[castor oil]].&lt;ref name=book6&gt;[https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=yWVYAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=mallakhamb&amp;dq=mallakhamb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwismdT0j7nUAhVHo48KHbRBC6E4ChDoAQgiMAE Sport in the USSR. - Issues 1-12; Issues 286-297, pp.9]&lt;/ref&gt; Three popular versions of Mallakhamba are practiced using a sheesham pole, cane, or rope.&lt;ref name=book7&gt;[https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=GaHdu9qd-e8C&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=mallakhamb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwismdT0j7nUAhVHo48KHbRBC6E4ChDoAQgwMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mallakhamb&amp;f=false Sport Across Asia: Politics, Cultures, and Identities, Katrin Bromber, Birgit Krawietz, Joseph Maguire. 2013, pp137]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Mallakhamba derives from the terms ''malla'' meaning wrestler, and ''khamb'' which means a pole. Literally meaning "wrestling pole", the term refers to a traditional training implement used by wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mallakhamb - History, Indian Gymnastic Pole, Information In English|url=https://www.evergalax.com/content/mallakhamb|date=12 September 2018|location=Mumbai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 2013, the Indian state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] declared Mallakhamba the state sport. More than 20 other states in India have followed suit.&lt;ref name=book5&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/photos/india-news/photos-mallakamb-the-art-of-aerial-yoga/photo-P5Ml0CXIN6UMPP5846OexJ.html Photos Mallakamb the art of aerial yoga, Hindustan Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest mention of Mallakhamb can be traced to the 12th Century, where it is referred to in the 1135 AD Sanskrit classic [[Manasollasa]] ([[Kannada language|Kannada]]: ''ಮನಸೋಲ್ಲಾಸ'') written by [[Someshvara III|Someshvara Chalukya]]. For about seven centuries after that, the art form remained dormant until it was given a new lease on life by Balambhatta Dada Deodhar, the renowned teacher of [[Peshwa]] (prime minister) [[Baji Rao II]]. During the first half of the 19th century, [[Rani of Jhansi|Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi]] learned Mallakhamb with her childhood friends [[Nana Sahib]] and [[Tatya Tope]].&lt;ref name=Book1&gt;[https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=h747vxHZd9wC&amp;pg=PT10&amp;dq=mallkhamb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_huqKh7nUAhXMLY8KHbBXD404ChDoAQglMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=mallkhamb&amp;f=false Rani Lakshmibai, by Deepa Agarwal, Puffin Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of Mallakhamb as competitive sport ==
Competitive Mallakhamb at the national level first made its appearance at the National Gymnastics Championships held at the Pahadganj Stadium, [[Dehli]], [[India]], in the year 1958. It was here that the Gymnastics Federation of India proposed to recognize the game and include it in subsequent National Gymnastic Championships.The first National Mallakhamb Championships was held at [[Gwalior]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], India in the year 1962, as part of the National Gymnastics Championships. They were organised annually by the G.F.I until 1976, when they were disassociated from the G.F.I. from 1977 to 1980, during which time no recognized National Mallakhamb Championships were held. However, in the year 1968-69, the game was introduced in  the All India Inter University Gymnastics Championships.

Rakesh &amp; Rajesh Shrivastava, Dr. Bamshankar Joshi, and some other Mallakhamb enthusiasts at [[Ujjain]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]] founded an All India Level Association on 21 November, 1980, which was later called the " Mallakhamb Federation of India". The first All India Invitational National Mallakhamb Championships were organised by the New Sports Association from 27-29 January, 1981 at [[Ujjain]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]].The event brought in representatives from all over India, who participated in these championships and together they officially formed the " Mallakhamb Federation of India" on 29 January, 1981. Since then, the National Mallakhamb Championships are being organised by different state associations affiliated to the Federation.

== As a competitive sport ==
Currently all mallakhamb competitions are organised under the rules made by the Mallakhamb Federation of India. 29 states are affiliated to the Federation. mallakhamb competitions cover three varieties: 1. Pole Mallakhamb, 2. Hanging Mallakhamb 3. Rope Mallakhamb.

* '''POLE MALLAKHAMB''' 

In this style, a vertical wooden pole of teakwood or sheesam is fixed to the ground. The pole is smeared with castor oil, which helps to minimize excessive friction as the body comes in contact with the pole. The specifications of Pole Mallakhamb are as follows:

* '''HANGING MALLAKHAMB'''

The specifications of Hanging Mallakhamb are as follows:

* '''ROPE MALLAKHAMB'''

== Types ==
Between 25 and 31 types of Mallakhamb apparatus have been tried and tested over the years. 16 various types are recognized presently, but for sport, only six types are used. Mallakhamb is present in the [[Hind Kesari]], Indian Wrestling championship.&lt;ref name="Sunday"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundayindian.com/article_print.php?article_id=2115|title=Mallakhamb vies for pole position... bottoms up|date=15 July 2007|newspaper=The Sunday Indian|accessdate=|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitively, there are three main variations of Mallakhamba. All types are practiced by both men and women, though pole Mallakhamb is more popularly practiced by men and boys and rope Mallakamb by women and girls.&lt;ref name=book9&gt;[https://books.google.com.sg/books?isbn=0230290434 Pole Dancing, Empowerment and Embodiment, S. Holland. 2010. pp.62]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pole ===
In this variation, a vertical wooden pole is fixed in the ground and the participant performs various [[acrobatic]] feats and poses while hanging on the pole. Wrestlers mount, dismount, and utilize this pole for various complex calisthenics designed to develop their grip, stamina, and strength in the arms, legs, and upper body.

There are a number of pillars, although the most common is a free-standing upright pole, some eight to ten inches in diameter, planted into the ground. The pole used in competitions is a straight pole made of [[teak]] or [[sheesham]] wood, standing {{convert|2.6|m|ft}} in height with a circumference of {{convert|55|cm|in}} at the base. It gradually tapers to a circumference of {{convert|35|cm|in}} at the top.

=== Hanging ===
The hanging Mallakhamb is a wooden pole that is shorter in length than the standard pole and is hung from chain and hooks, leaving a gap between the ground and the bottom of the Mallakhamb.

=== Rope ===
In this variation, the participant performs exercises while hanging on a rope suspended from a support at the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mallakhamb: Ancient Indian sport|url=http://news.in.msn.com/gallery/mallakhamb-ancient-indian-sport|accessdate=|newspaper=MSN News|date=5 December 2012|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the rope is 5.5 m long, and approximately 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. The rope is caught by the performer in the gap between the big toe and the second toe, along with one or both hands. The performer then ties the rope around himself or herself through a sequence of steps, after climbing upwards on the rope. The performer then reaches various positions called ''Udi'' (''to fly''), some of which are imitations of standard Yoga [[Asana]].

== History of classification ==
In 1983, classification for cerebral palsy competitors in this sport was done by the [[Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association]] (CP-ISRA).&lt;ref name="cpirsa-1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Classification and sport rules manual|publisher = CP-ISRA|year = 1983|edition = Third|location = Wolfheze, the Netherlands|page = 1|oclc = 220878468|author = Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They defined cerebral palsy as a non-progressive brain legion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non-progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them.   The organisation also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments.  For their classification system, people with [[spina bifida]] were not eligible unless they had medical evidence of loco-motor dysfunction. People with cerebral palsy and [[epilepsy]] were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete. People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance.  Competitors with [[multiple sclerosis]], [[muscular dystrophy]] and [[arthrogryposis]] were not eligible for classification by CP-ISRA, but were eligible for classification by [[International Sports Organisation for the Disabled]] for the [[Games of Les Autres]].&lt;ref name="cpirsa-78"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Classification and sport rules manual|publisher = CP-ISRA|year = 1983|edition = Third|location = Wolfheze, the Netherlands|pages = 7–8|oclc = 220878468|author = Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CP-ISRA used the classification system designed for field athletics events.&lt;ref name="cpirsa-46"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Classification and sport rules manual|publisher = CP-ISRA|year = 1983|edition = Third|location = Wolfheze, the Netherlands|pages = 4–6|oclc = 220878468|author = Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, there were five cerebral palsy classifications. Class 1 competitors could compete in the Division 1, Class 1 and Class 2 events, while riding with a leader and 2 siderwalkers and/or a backwalker.&lt;ref name="cpirsa-13-15"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Classification and sport rules manual|publisher = CP-ISRA|year = 1983|edition = Third|location = Wolfheze, the Netherlands|pages = 13–38|oclc = 220878468|author = Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the [[Equestrian Australia]] did not have specific classifications for competitors with disabilities.  Acknowledging membership needs though, some rules had organically developed that looked like classifications based on rule modification for different disability types.  These included acknowledging one-armed riders were not required to hold the reins in both arms, riders with hearing loss were given visual signals instead of audio signals at the start of and during an event, and blind riders, when they reached a marker, were given an auditory signal.&lt;ref name="conferencebook"&gt;{{cite book|title = The development of a policy : Integration Conference 1990 Adelaide, December 3-5, 1990.|publisher = Australian Confederation of Sports for the Disabled|year = 1990|location = Willoughby, N.S.W.|oclc = 221061502|author1 = Australian Sports Commission|author2 = Australian Confederation of Sports for the Disabled}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the sport was undergoing growth in 1995, a classification system was established in order to provide a level playing field for competitors.  The system developed at the time was called "Functional Profile System for Grading" and was largely created by [[Christine Meaden]], who had IPEC classifier status.  By 1999, there were four classifications for competitors and 120 accredited equestrian classifiers around the world.&lt;ref name="newhorizongs-equestrians"&gt;{{cite book|title = New horizons in sport for athletes with a disability|last2 = Kröner|first2 = Michael|last3 = Sonnenschein|first3 = Werner|publisher = Meyer &amp; Meyer Sport|year = 2001|isbn = 1841260371|volume = 2|location = Oxford (UK)|pages = 733–741|chapter = Development and Growth of Paralympic Equestrian Sport 1995 to 1999|oclc = 492107955|first1 = Gudrun|last1 = Doll-Tepper|author4 = International Paralympic Committee, Sport Science Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the New York hosted [[Empire State Games for the Physically Challenged]], para-equestrian competition was broken into hearing and vision impaired classifications, amputee classifications,  Les Autres, cerebral palsy and spinal cord disabilities.&lt;ref name="BirrerGriesemer2002"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=F2RgiYyPXmsC&amp;pg=PA229|title = Pediatric Sports Medicine for Primary Care|date = 20 August 2002|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn = 978-0-7817-3159-1|pages = 229|author1 = Richard B. Birrer|author2 = Bernard Griesemer|author3 = Mary B. Cataletto|accessdate = 21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1996 Summer Paralympics, classification was done at the venue because classification assessment required watching a competitor play the sport.&lt;ref name="newhorizongs-shooting"&gt;{{cite book|title = New Horizons in sport for athletes with a disability : proceedings of the International VISTA '99 Conference, Cologne, Germany, 28 August-1 September 1999|last2 = Kröner|first2 = Michael|last3 = Sonnenschein|first3 = Werner|publisher = Meyer &amp; Meyer Sport|year = 2001|isbn = 1841260363|volume = 1|location = Oxford (UK)|pages = 379–392|chapter = Organisation and Administration of the Classification Process for the Paralympics|oclc = 48404898|first1 = Gudrun|last1 = Doll-Tepper|author4 = International Paralympic Committee, Sport Science Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]], 6 assessments were conducted at the Games.  This resulted in 1 class change.&lt;ref name="Games-2000-152"&gt;{{cite book|title = Benchmark games : the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games|last2 = Darcy|first2 = Simon|publisher = Walla Walla Press in conjunction with the Australian Centre for Olympic Studies University of Technology, Sydney|year = 2008|location = Petersham, N.S.W.|page = 152|first1 = Richard I|last1 = Cashman|author3 = University of Technology, Sydney. Australian Centre for Olympic Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003.  This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level. It required that classification be sport specific, and served two roles.  The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class.  The IPC left it up to International Federations, in this case [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]], to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9ARIDAAAQBAJ|title = Training and Coaching the Paralympic Athlete|last = Vanlandewijck|first = Yves C.|last2 = Thompson|first2 = Walter R.|date = 2016-06-01|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn = 9781119045120|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth edition of FEI's classification system guide was published in  January 2015.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fei.org/sites/default/files/FEI%20Para%20Equestrian%20Classification%20Manual_January%202015.pdf|title = PARA-EQUESTRIAN CLASSIFICATION MANUAL, Fourth Edition|last =|first =|date = January 2015|website = FEI|publisher = FEI|access-date = July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Going forward, disability sport's major classification body, the [[International Paralympic Committee]], is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less.&lt;ref name="ipc-history"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.paralympic.org/Classification/History|title = Classification History|publisher = International Paralympic Committee|location = Bonn, Germany|accessdate = 30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification process ==
The purpose of classification to identify the level of functional disability of a rider, completely independent of their skill level.  This is because demonstration of skill is the purpose of competition.  Steps are taken before and during the classification process to avoid this.  Part of the process involves observing the competitor riding and doing a bench press.  For this reason, classifiers do not observe a rider on their horse prior to the bench press to avoid assessing skill at functionality.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

During classification, classifiers look at several things including a rider's  mobility, strength and coordination.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   This is done during a bench press, during training and in competition.&lt;ref name="qualifyingapc" /&gt; After riders are classified, they are giving both a classification and a profile.  This profile a number 1 to 39 for para-dressage and 1 to 32 for para-driving.  This profile impacts what adaptive equipment riders can use.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Each rider's classification has a status.  The available statuses for classification include New, Review, Reviewed Fixe Date - Paralympic Games, and Confirmed. The status of a rider's classification affects their ability to protest their classification.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Classification governance ==
Internationally, classification is handled by [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fei.org/fei/disc/dressage/about-para-equestrian|title = About Para-Equestrian Dressage|date = 2012-07-31|access-date = 2016-07-22|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140322035046/http://www.fei.org/fei/disc/dressage/about-para-equestrian|archivedate = 2014-03-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Classification at the national level is handled by different organizations.

== Criticism ==
The classification system in para-equestrian has been criticized by some riders as not fully taking into account disabilities that have fluctuations in a person's regular functional abilities.  This criticism specifically related to multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WOAxBwAAQBAJ|title = A Geography of Horse-Riding: The Spacing of Affect, Emotion and (Dis)ability Identity through Horse-Human Encounters|last = Nosworthy|first = Cheryl|date = 2014-08-11|publisher = Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn = 9781443865524|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nordic combined ==
{{main|Nordic combined at the 1928 Winter Olympics}}

Events:
* 18&amp;nbsp;km cross-country skiing
* normal hill ski jumping

The cross-country skiing part of this event was combined with the [[Cross-country skiing at the 1928 Winter Olympics|main medal event]] of cross-country skiing. Those results can be found above in this article in the cross-country skiing section. Some athletes (but not all) entered in both the cross-country skiing and Nordic combined event, their time on the 18&amp;nbsp;km was used for both events. One would expect that athletes competing at the Nordic combined event, would participate in the cross-country skiing event as well, as they would have the opportunity to win more than one medal. This was not always the case due to the maximum number of athletes that could represent a country per event.

The ski jumping (normal hill) event was held separate from the main medal event of ski jumping, results can be found in the table below.

{{International opposition to Apartheid}}
[[South Africa]] under [[apartheid]] was subjected to a variety of international [[boycott]]s, including on sporting contacts. There was some debate about whether the aim of the boycott was to end segregation in sport, or to end apartheid together.&lt;ref name="Booth2003"&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Booth |first=Douglas | authorlink=Doug Booth |year=2003 |title=Hitting Apartheid for Six? The Politics of the South African Sports Boycott |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |volume= 38 |issue= 3 |pages=477–493 |doi=10.1177/0022009403038003008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations==
In 1980, the United Nations began compiling a "Register of Sports Contacts with South Africa".&lt;ref name="nytreg"&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE2D61530F936A25757C0A96E948260  |title=U.N. Reports Contacts With South Africa |last=Rogers|first=Thomas|date=15 April 1988 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=23 November 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This was a list of sportspeople and officials who had participated in events within South Africa.&lt;ref name="nytreg"/&gt; It was compiled mainly from reports in South African newspapers.&lt;ref name="nytreg"/&gt; Being listed did not itself result in any punishment, but was regarded as a moral pressure on athletes.&lt;ref name="nytreg"/&gt; Some sports bodies would discipline athletes based on the register.&lt;ref name="nytreg"/&gt; Athletes could have their names deleted from the register by giving a written undertaking not to return to apartheid South Africa to compete.&lt;ref name="nytreg"/&gt; The register is regarded as having been an effective instrument.&lt;ref name="Booth2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reddy"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] adopted the '''International Convention against Apartheid in Sports''' on 10 December 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/12.htm |title=International Convention Against Apartheid in Sports |date=10 December 1985 |publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] |accessdate=23 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327030038/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/12.htm |archivedate=27 March 2008 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Olympic Games==
{{main article|Apartheid-era South Africa and the Olympics}}
The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) withdrew its invitation to South Africa to the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] when interior minister [[Jan de Klerk]] insisted the team would not be racially integrated.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Booth |first=Douglas |title=The Race Game: Sport and Politics in South Africa |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=1998 |page=88 |isbn=0-7146-4799-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], the IOC was prepared to readmit South Africa after assurances that its team would be multi-racial; but a threatened boycott by African nations and others forestalled this.&lt;ref name="time68"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900012,00.html|title=Boycotting South Africa|date=8 March 1968|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South African Games]] of 1969 and 1973 were intended to allow Olympic-level competition for South Africans against foreign athletes. South Africa was formally expelled from the IOC in 1970.&lt;ref name="mgheyde"&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2007-01-16-apartheid-the-political-influence-of-sport |title=Apartheid: The political influence of sport |last=auf der Heyde |first=Peter |date=16 January 2007 |work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]|accessdate=23 November 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], African nations demanded that [[New Zealand]] be suspended by the IOC for continued contacts with South Africa, including a tour by the [[New Zealand national rugby union team]]. When the IOC refused, the African teams withdrew from the games.&lt;ref name="AfricaXXIOlympics"&gt;{{cite web| title=On This Day 17 July 1976 |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=17 January 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/17/newsid_3555000/3555450.stm | date=17 July 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contributed to the [[Gleneagles Agreement]] being adopted by the [[Commonwealth]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="Gleneagles"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/1981-springbok-tour/gleneagles-agreement |title=From Montreal to Gleneagles  |accessdate=14 June 2008 |publisher=nzhistory.net.nz |last=Watters |first=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC adopted a declaration against "apartheid in sport" on 21 June 1988, for the total isolation of apartheid sport.&lt;ref name="reddy"/&gt;

==Commonwealth Games==
The [[1934 British Empire Games]], originally awarded in 1930 to [[Johannesburg]], was moved to London after the (pre-apartheid) South Africa government refused to allow nonwhite participants.&lt;ref name="Gorman2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gorman|first=Daniel|title=The Emergence of International Society in the 1920s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b5DlxTDEIaYC&amp;pg=PA170|accessdate=27 May 2013|date=31 July 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107021136|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Africa at the Commonwealth Games|South Africa continued to participate]] in every Games until [[South African Constitution of 1961|it left the Commonwealth in 1961]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecgf.com/countries/tally.asp?countryid=56|title=South Africa - Medals Tally by Games|work=Commonwealth Countries - Results by Games|publisher=Commonwealth Games Federation|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecgf.com/countries/intro.asp?countryid=56&amp;resultsid=&amp;gamesid=|title=South Africa|work=Commonwealth Countries - Introduction|publisher=Commonwealth Games Federation|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]]'s refusal to enforce the Gleneagles Agreement in the UK led Nigeria to initiate a boycott of the [[1986 Commonwealth Games]] in Edinburgh, from which 32 of 59 eligible teams withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downes|first=Aviston D.|year=2002|title=Sport and International Diplomacy: The Case of the Commonwealth Caribbean and the Anti-Apartheid Campaign, 1959–1992|journal=The Sports Historian|volume=22|issue=2|pages=23–45|issn=1351-5462|doi=10.1080/17460260209443382}}; {{cite journal|last=Seidel|first=Gill|year=1988|title=‘We condemn apartheid, BUT …’: a discursive analysis of the European Parliamentary debate on sanctions (July 1986)1|journal=The Sociological Review|volume=36|issue=S1|pages=222–249|issn=0038-0261|doi=10.1111/j.1467-954X.1988.tb03333.x}}; {{cite journal|last=Booth|first=Douglas|year=1995|title=Sports Policy in Australia: Right, Just and Rational?|journal=The Australian Quarterly|volume=67|issue=1|pages=1–10: 3 |issn=0005-0091|doi=10.2307/20635800|jstor=20635800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NCAA==
The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]], which governs many North American university sports, permitted South Africans to receive [[athletic scholarship]]s and compete in its events.&lt;ref name="Bale1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bale|first=John|title=The Brawn Drain: Foreign Student-athletes in American Universities|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAT-cFlq0gQC&amp;pg=PA195|accessdate=18 April 2016|date=1991|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252017322|pages=195–6|chapter=Interpreting the Brawn Drain; The South African connection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most such [[student athlete]]s were white; one exception was runner [[Sydney Maree]], who later became a U.S. citizen.&lt;ref name="Bale1991" /&gt;

==By sport==
The extent of boycotting varied between different sports, in the degree of contact permitted and the severity of punishment of "rebels" who defied the sanctions. This reflected the different political and social composition of each sport's governing [[international federation]] (IF).

===Athletics===
In [[track and field athletics]], a motion to suspend South Africa from the [[IAAF]] was defeated in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;Booth (1998), p.87&lt;/ref&gt; but had been passed by 1970.&lt;ref name="booth99"/&gt; [[Zola Budd]]'s time for the [[5000 metres|women's 5,000m]] in January 1984 was not ratified as a [[world records in athletics|world record]] because it was outside the auspices of the IAAF.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Chess in South Africa|Chess]]===
In the [[19th Chess Olympiad|1970 Chess Olympiad]], a number of players and teams protested against South Africa's inclusion, some withdrawing themselves, and the Albanian team forfeited its match against the South African team. South Africa were expelled from [[FIDE]] while participating in the [[21st Chess Olympiad|1974 Chess Olympiad]], finally returning to international competition in the [[30th Chess Olympiad|1992 Chess Olympiad]].

===Cricket===
Cricket had been organised on racial lines in South Africa from its earliest days with the coloured cricketer [[Krom Hendricks]] excluded from provincial and national teams from the 1890s. However, the cricketing boycott was prompted by the reaction of the South African authorities to the selection of [[Basil D'Oliveira]], a "[[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]]" South African, for the [[England national cricket team]] in 1968;&lt;ref&gt;Booth (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; see the [[D'Oliveira affair]]. The 1970 South African tour of England was called off and replaced by a [[Rest of the World cricket team in England in 1970|"Rest of the World" tour]] featuring several South African players. The [[International Cricket Conference]] (ICC) imposed a moratorium on tours in 1970.&lt;ref name="booth99"&gt;Booth (1998), p.99&lt;/ref&gt; There were [[International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981|several private tours in the 1970s]] and [[South African rebel tours|"rebel" tours in the 1980s]]. Participants in the latter were banned by their national federations upon returning. [[World Series Cricket]], run outside the auspices of the ICC in 1977–79, included South African players in its [[World Series Cricket World XI|"Rest of the World" team]].

===Golf===
In the [[World Cup of Golf|World Cup]], the Greek government banned South Africa from the 1979 competition in [[Athens]]. South Africa competed in the 1980 edition in [[Bogota]]. The prospect of their appearing in the 1981 edition, due to be staged at [[Waterville, County Kerry|Waterville]] in Ireland, caused it to be cancelled. South Africa did not reappear until the post-apartheid era in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

South African golfers continued to play around the world, including [[PGA Tour]], [[European Tour]], and [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]] events. Outside golfers competed freely in [[South African Tour]] events. The [[Sun City Million Dollar Challenge|Million Dollar Challenge]] at the [[Sun City, North West|Sun City resort]] regularly attracted some of the world's top golfers. The [[Official World Golf Ranking]] included South African Tour events in its calculations from its instigation in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dps.twiihosting.net/wgr/doc/content/archive/1986/owgr01f1986.pdf |title=First issue of Sony rankings |last=Greer |first=Tony |date=6 April 1986 |publisher=[[The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews|Royal and Ancient Golf Club]] |accessdate=23 November 2008 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motorsport===
South African [[Jody Scheckter]] was the [[1979 Formula One season|1979 Formula One]] champion. The [[South African Grand Prix|South African Formula One Grand Prix]] and the [[South African motorcycle Grand Prix]] were held in 1985 for the final time until the end of apartheid. Various teams boycotted the [[1985 South African Grand Prix|1985 Formula One race]], some teams in this international motorsport boycotting as part of pressure from their own governments, as part of the mounting pressure against apartheid.

===Rugby union===
{{main article|Rugby union and apartheid}}
South Africa remained a member of the [[International Rugby Board]] (IRB) throughout the apartheid era. [[Halt All Racist Tours]] was established in New Zealand in 1969 to oppose continued tours to and from South Africa. Apartheid South Africa's last foreign tour was [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|to New Zealand in 1981]]. This tour was highly controversial due to the difference of opinions. Though contacts were restricted after the Gleneagles Agreement in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|by the British Lions]] and [[1980 France rugby union tour of South Africa|by France]], in 1981 [[1981 Ireland rugby union tour of South Africa|by Ireland]], and in 1984 [[1984 England rugby union tour of South Africa|by England]]. In 1986, though a Lions tour was cancelled, South Africans played in all-star matches [[Rest of the World XV|in Cardiff]] and [[Overseas Unions rugby union team|in London]] marking the IRB centenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Starmer-Smith|first=Nigel|authorlink=Nigel Starmer-Smith|title=Rugby - A Way of Life, An Illustrated History of Rugby|date=1986 |publisher=Lennard Books|isbn=0-7126-2662-X|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;  South Africa was excluded from the first two [[Rugby World Cup]]s, in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] and [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]].

===Football===
South Africa was suspended from [[FIFA]] in 1963. [[Stanley Rous]], FIFA's President, went to negotiate its reinstatement. The South African FA proposed entering an all-white team in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] and an all-black team in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]]. This proposal was rejected.&lt;ref name="mgheyde"/&gt;

===Table tennis===
The South African Table Tennis Board (SATTB), a body founded in contravention to the white South African table tennis board, was substituted for the latter by the [[International Table Tennis Federation]]. While the SATTB team was able to participate in the world championships held in [[Stockholm]] in 1957, team members were immediately refused passports by the government. It ruled that no black could compete internationally except through the white sports body.

===Tennis===
The [[South Africa Davis Cup team]] was ejected from the [[1970 Davis Cup]], in part thanks to campaigning by [[Arthur Ashe]]. It was reinstated [[1970 Davis Cup|in 1973]] but placed in the [[1973 Davis Cup Americas Zone|Americas Zone]] instead of the [[1973 Davis Cup Europe Zone|Europe Zone]] where other African countries played. It won the [[1974 Davis Cup]] after [[India Davis Cup team|India]] refused to travel to South Africa for the final. There were protests at its matches in the United States in [[1977 Davis Cup Americas Zone|1977]] and [[1978 Davis Cup Americas Zone|1978]].&lt;ref name="nytimesdeepsouthsslewhester"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amdur|first1=Neil|title=Deep South's Slew Hester: A Canny Tennis Maverick|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/03/20/archives/deep-souths-slew-hester-a-canny-tennis-maverick.html|accessdate=10 July 2017|work=The New York Times|date=20 March 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpostustanochoiceondavis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimesusdaviscupteambeats"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amdur|first1=Neil|title=U.S. Davis Cup Team Beats South Africa |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/20/archives/us-davis-cup-team-beats-south-africa-us-davis-cup-team-beats-south.html|accessdate=10 July 2017|work=The New York Times|date=20 March 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 several countries threatened to withdraw, and in 1978 several did withdraw in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. withdraws from Davis Cup |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=edk0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Kn4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6973,226181&amp;dq=us+withdraws+from+davis+cup&amp;hl=en |work=The Deseret News |date=1 July 1976 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 South Africa was banned again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=South Africa Expelled from Cup Play |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19780417&amp;id=FQ9PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bgIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4837,4807800 |work=Toledo Blade |date=17 April 1978 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South Africa Fed Cup team|South Africa women's team]] participated in the [[Fed Cup|Federation Cup]] (now Fed Cup) through to [[1977 Federation Cup (tennis)|1977]]. It hosted and won [[1972 Federation Cup (tennis)|the 1972 edition]] in [[Johannesburg]].

[[William Hester]], the president of the [[United States Tennis Association]], decided to let a tournament between the United States and South Africa take place in [[Newport Beach, California]] in April 1977 in spite of backlash from African nations and protesters due to the apartheid regime.&lt;ref name="nytimesdeepsouthsslewhester"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washpostustanochoiceondavis"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lorge|first1=Barry|title=USTA: No Choice On Davis Clash With S.

But we have entered the draw and, unfortunately, we have to play South Africa - and in the United States."&lt;ref name="washpostustanochoiceondavis"/&gt; Meanwhile, [[Joseph E. Carrico]], the USTA's first vice president at the time and later president, blamed the low attendance on negative stories published by ''[[The Tennessean]]'', even after a reporter was escorted out of the gym by the police.&lt;ref name="nytimesusdaviscupteambeats"/&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', the event included "more police (150) than protesters (40) outside the gym."&lt;ref name="nytimesusdaviscupteambeats"/&gt;

South African players continued to compete on the pro tours; [[Johan Kriek]] and [[Kevin Curren]] reached [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] finals, though both later became naturalised [[Citizenship in the United States|US citizens]].

==Foreign eligibility==
Some elite South African sportspeople competed internationally for another country, after becoming eligible through [[naturalization]], length of [[Residency (domicile)|residency]], or other criteria applicable by the relevant IF. Examples include runner [[Zola Budd]], whose UK nationality application was fast-tracked in time for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]];&lt;ref name="ReidAustin2012"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Reid|editor-first1=Heather Lynne|editor-last2=Austin|editor-first2=Michael W.|last1=Hardman |first1=Alan R.|last2=Iorwerth|first2=Hywel |title=The Olympics and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tbIc_qX4vd0C&amp;pg=PA256|accessdate=16 April 2016|year=2012|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=9780813136486|pages=256–272: 256|chapter=Sport, patriotism, and the Olympic Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cricketer [[Kepler Wessels]], who acquired Australian eligibility in the 1980s through residency, before returning to South Africa, for whom he played after the end of apartheid.&lt;ref name="Farred2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farred|first=Grant|title=Midfielder's Moment: Coloured Literature and Culture in Contemporary South Africa|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780813335148|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1994 film ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]'' recounts a fictional 1980s Australian's sham marriage to a South African swimmer seeking Olympic eligibility.&lt;ref name="Farred2000" /&gt;

==End of apartheid==
With the end of apartheid, sports rapidly ended their boycotts and South Africa was readmitted in the [[International sports federations]]. The [[European Community]] announced its member governments' ending of the boycott in June 1991.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0DA1F3EF933A05755C0A967958260 |author=[[Associated Press]] |title=Europeans Lift South Africa Sports Boycott |date=30 June 1991 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=23 November 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]], which vehemently opposed South Africa's apartheid policy and was at the forefront of isolating the country internationally at all levels, ended its boycott in 1991 by inviting the [[South Africa national cricket team|South African cricket team]] to the country for [[South African cricket team in India in 1991–92|an ODI series]] and subsequently allowed the [[India national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] to [[Indian cricket team in South Africa in 1992–93|tour South Africa]] for a [[Test cricket|Test]] and [[one day international|ODI]] series in late 1992. The country's hosting and winning of the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] was a powerful boost to post-apartheid South Africa's return to the international sporting scene.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Srednja Bloudkova''' ({{lang-en|Bloudek's normal hill}}) was a [[ski jumping]] K90 hill located in [[Planica]], Slovenia, that existed between 1949 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osc-planica.si/uploads/file/0EngPlanica10.pdf |title=All comeptitititons and winners in Planica since 1934 |publisher=osc-planica |accessdate=14 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305122001/http://www.osc-planica.si/uploads/file/0EngPlanica10.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2018}}

==History==
The hill was opened in 1949 and constructed by Slovenian [[engineer]] [[Stanko Bloudek]]. The hill has a perfect location and the first original inrun was made of thin steel stick construction. His main assistant at the construction of this hill was Stano Pelan, Slovenian pilot, constructor, bank officer, working supervisor, credited as Planica expert, FIS judge of ski jumping and technical judge delegate. This hill is also known under his name.

Winner of first international opening competition on this hill on 27 March 1949 was [[Janez Polda]]. Winner of the last international competition on March 28, 1971 was East German [[Hans-Georg Aschenbach]].

Winner of the first World Cup competition on 21 March 1980 was Austrian [[Hans Millonig]].

Constructors of present hill are brothers [[Vlado Gorišek|Vlado]] and [[Janez Gorišek]]. They reconstructed hill in 1989. In hill axis there was a wooden sculpture of a ski jumper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mss.gov.si/fileadmin/mss.gov.si/pageuploads/razpisi/sport/JR_Planica_vode_1_4_10_P2.pdf|title=Complete environment report for Planica Nordic Centre|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last World Cup event was on 11 December 1994 with Austrian winner [[Andreas Goldberger]]. In total there was 11 individual World Cup competitions. Last official ski jumping event on this hill was held on 2007 FIS Nordic Junior World Ski Championships replacing [[Tarvisio]], a venue dealing with a lack of snow. Those were also the last ski jumps ever at this hill.

As a part of [[Planica Nordic Centre]] renovation, the hill was completely demolished in late 2012. It stands just a few meters away from Stano Pelan Hill and right next to the [[Bloudkova velikanka]]. After they demolished Stano Pelan Hill, they built two completely new medium ski jumping hills at the same place, which are used for training. They are HS 62 and HS 80 size. Those two smaller hills opened in December 2013.

'''Stade Armand-Cesari''', also known as the '''Stade de Furiani''', is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Furiani]], [[France]].  It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches of [[SC Bastia]]. The stadium is able to hold 16,000 people and opened in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldstadiums.com/europe/countries/france/corse.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the venue for the first leg of the [[1978 UEFA Cup Final]], which saw a 0-0 tie between [[SC Bastia]] and the [[Netherlands|Dutch-side]] [[PSV Eindhoven]]. Eventually, PSV won the Final with a 3-0 victory on their home ground [[Philips Stadion]].

The record attendance at the stadium was set on 1 September 2012, when 15,505 people saw Bastia lose against by [[AS Saint-Etienne|St. Etienne]] (0-3) in league matches.&lt;ref name="stade armand cesari"&gt;[http://www.sc-bastia.net/v4/?page_id=4865 U Stade Armand Cesari], SC Bastia, Retrieved 30 July 2012 (in French).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sc-bastia.net/v4/?p=16750 Les échos autour de Bastia-Saint-Etienne], [[SC Bastia]], 2 September 2012 (in French).&lt;/ref&gt; This broke the record set on 26 April 1978, when 15,000 people saw Bastia draw 0-0 against [[PSV Eindhoven]] in the first leg of the [[1978 UEFA Cup Final]].&lt;ref name="stade armand cesari"/&gt;

==Furiani disaster==
[[File:Furiani-stade.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Stade de Furiani in 2009.]]
{{main|Armand Césari Stadium disaster}}
The stadium is mostly known outside Corsica for the '''Furiani disaster''', which took place on 5 May 1992 when one of the four terraces fell, causing the death of 18 people and injuring more than 2,300 others.

===Background===
When they reached the semi-final of the [[Coupe de France 1991-92]], the draw gave Bastia a tie against [[Olympique de Marseille]], the [[Ligue 1|Division 1]] leader at the time. In order to accommodate more fans, the club board decided to create a temporary terrace instead of the old ''Tribune Claude Papi'' which could only take 750 fans. The new capacity of the terrace was 10,000.

===Matchday===
An hour before the start of the match, problems were already noticeable, such as the instability of the structure. At 8:20&amp;nbsp;p.m., the whole structure collapsed, with supporters and journalists in the wreckage. Every medical option on the island was exhausted. The victims were eventually evacuated to the mainland, including Marseille. [[Bastia - Poretta Airport|Poretta Airport]] was quoted as resembling more of a hospital than an airport that night.

===Aftermath===
On 8 May, an official investigation began in order to find who was responsible. After the disaster, the [[French Football Federation|FFF]] decided - after some hesitation - to cancel the remaining matches in the Cup. On the 12th, the investigators came to the conclusion that there had been a number of rules broken concerning the terrace. All these findings led to the investigation's conclusion "Le soir du 5 mai, il n'y a pas eu de fatalité . (There has been no fate the night of the 5th May)". Ultimately, at the trial a year later, the main protagonists were proved guilty but were only given prison sentences of less than two years.

==Recent history==
Since the disaster, the stadium waited a long time to be rebuilt. The ''Tribune Nord'' was rebuilt in 1997, before Bastia could play again in the [[1997–98 UEFA Cup]].

For the 100th anniversary of the club, in 2005, the four terraces were renamed:
* North terrace: ''Tribune Claude Papi''
* East terrace: ''Tribune Jojo Petrignani''
* South terrace: ''Tribune Victor Lorenzi''
* West terrace: ''Tribune Pierre Cahuzac''

The '''Stade Pierre-Mauroy''' is a multi-use (Arena), [[retractable roof]] [[stadium]] (50,186 seats) in [[Villeneuve-d'Ascq]], [[Lille]] ([[Métropole Européenne de Lille|European Metropolis of Lille]]), [[Hauts-de-France]]; that opened in August 2012. It is located in the Hôtel de Ville quarter of Villeneuve d'Ascq and is the home stadium of [[Lille OSC]]. Initially named '''Grand Stade Lille Métropole''', the stadium was renamed on 21 June 2013, just after the death of the former Mayor of Lille and former [[Prime Minister of France]] [[Pierre Mauroy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Ce-sera-le-stade-pierre-mauroy/380279|script-title=Ce sera le stade Pierre Mauroy|title=It will be Stade Pierre Mauroy|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Before the Grand Stade===
In 1975, [[Lille OSC]] began playing at the [[Stade Grimonprez-Jooris]], a 21,128-seat facility. When the club began to play European Competitions, the venue did not match [[UEFA]] standards, prompting the club to play its [[UEFA Champions League]] games at the [[Stade Bollaert-Delelis|Stade Félix-Bollaert]], home of rival [[RC Lens]], in 2001. Plans were soon made to build a new stadium which would match UEFA demands, but the project was postponed and finally cancelled due to struggle with [[preservationist]]s who stated that the location chosen for the new stadium was too close to the 17th Century [[Citadel of Lille|Citadel]].

The club, left without a place to play, moved to the [[Stadium Nord Lille Métropole|Stadium Nord]] which was smaller than Grimonprez-Jooris (18,154 seats) and did not fulfill UEFA demands. This situation forced the team, who had qualified for [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League]], to play at the [[Stade de France]] for its European matches. This solution was abandoned after two young LOSC fans lost their lives when they got hit by an incoming train after a game against [[Olympique Lyonnais]].

===New administration, new project===
While LOSC was struggling with its stadium problems, the administrative landscape of the Lille area changed. The city was now included in a vast association with its enclosed neighbours, forming the [[Urban Community of Lille Métropole]]. The new administration, now in charge of the whole area, decided to launch a new stadium project. On 5 December 2006, an industrial bid for a 50,000-seat multi-purpose stadium, able to receive sport competitions, cultural shows and hold seminars, was launched.&lt;br /&gt;  The following January, three worldwide construction companies answered the call, each one with ambitious projects:

* Eiffage: a 50,000-seat capacity multi-purpose stadium, Meeting HQE standards with a [[retractable roof]]. The stadium has also a particularity: it can become a fully functional arena of 30,000 seats in only one hour: the ''Boite à spectacle''.
* Bouygues: The project proposed by the company was highly effective in energy saving. The structure was geothermic and most of its power was produced by [[Renewable energy]]. The stadium would have a 50,127-seat capacity.
* Vinci: The project proposed by Vinci was the largest of the competition with a 50,921-seat capacity and a retractable roof. It would have been powered by 8000 m² of [[Solar panel]]s

On February 2008, Eiffage was selected during a general meeting to build the stadium. The contract was officially signed between the two parties on October of the same year. Eiffage was given 45 months to complete the project

===Stadium construction===
On 10 July 2009, Eiffage received the building permit and authorisation to start preparatory works for the construction at the ''Borne de l'Espoir'' location in [[Villeneuve-d'Ascq]]. In December 2009, the final two cities of the Lille Métropole who had yet to sign the building permit joined the project and gave their authorisation. In February 2010, France officially became a candidate to organize the [[UEFA Euro 2016]]. The Grand Stade become the symbol of the candidature, boosting its public support.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lagazettedescommunes.com/4747/nord-pas-de-calais-le-grand-stade-de-lille-locomotive-de-la-candidature-a-leuro-2016/&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, construction of access infrastructure (Subway, Highway, parking lots) began followed one week after by the beginning of the construction of the arena itself. On 28 May 2010, France was officially chosen to organize the Euro 2016. [[Martine Aubry]], who succeeded [[Pierre Mauroy]] at the head of LCMU and a big supporter of LOSC and the Grand Stade, expressed her wish to see the Grand Stade given a prominent amount of competition for the upcoming competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leparisien.fr/lille-59000/euro-2016-martine-aubry-veut-huit-matches-au-grand-stade-27-09-2010-1085064.php&lt;/ref&gt; Construction accelerated, with the first brick laid by the Eiffage CEO in September 2010. In 2011, the structure supporting the roof was put in place and constructions of the northern stand was completed by the end of that year. In 2012, the retractable roof, constructed in one piece, was successfully put in place in one day. Despite some legal delays, the stadium was delivered on schedule during the summer of 2012, in time for the 2012–13 LOSC season.

==The stadium==

===Cost and financing===
The total cost of the Eiffage project was €618 million, including €282 million for the stadium, €42 million for additional development such as parking, hotels, and restaurants, and €96 million to ensure seismic standards were met.  This latter requirement was introduced in 2011, following a new law passed in the wake of the massive [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Japan earthquake and tsunami]].  The cost was spread between the city of Lille (€24.7 million annually for 31 years), the LOSC (€7.5 million annually) and the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] regional council (€45 million).

The cost of the project spurred considerable controversy. On one hand, [[Martine Aubry]] and her First Deputy [[Pierre de Saintignon]], in charge of the project, highlighted the Grand Stade as "a splendid ambassador of the technologies of our region, and a great tool of attractivity".  On the other hand, opponents pointed to a lack of long term viability, since part of the public investments were bound to sporting events, whose results are of random nature. This could lead to some new kind of toxic loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| journal= L'Express|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/sport/football/le-vrai-cout-du-grand-stade-de-lille_1177507.html|script-title=Le vrai coût du grand stade de Lille|title=The true price of the Grand Stade of Lille|author=Jacques Trentesaux|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple floor features===

[[File:Mauroy Stadium Eurobasket 2015.JPG|thumb|right|Stade Pierre-Mauroy during the [[FIBA EuroBasket 2015]]]]
Stade Pierre-Mauroy has two floors or main levels. The full stadium level or ''Grand Stade'' reaches a height of 31 m (101 feet) and has a total capacity of 50,186 seats including 4,965 business seats, 1,842 luxury-box seats, 448 protocol seats and 326 reserved for the press.

The stadium has also a peculiarity: half of the ''Grand Stade'' field is situated on hydraulics lift and massive tracks that raise and slide it above the other half of the field in three hours. This creates a second lower level floor plan and surrounding seats called ''Boîte à Spectacles'', where basketball, tennis or music shows can take place. The ''Boîte à Spectacles'' can be configured to have a variable capacity, from 6,900 to 30,000 seats. In November 2014, it hosted the [[2014 Davis Cup]] finals between France and Switzerland, where an attendance record was broken for the highest-ever officially sanctioned competition tennis match. In [[2017 Davis Cup|2017]] it hosted the Davis Cup final again.

[[File:Pierre Mauroy Stadium Tennis.jpg|thumb|right|Stade Pierre-Mauroy during the 2017 Davis Cup final]]
In addition, Stade Pierre-Mauroy has a retractable roof which opens and shuts in 15 minutes. The stadium is also recognised as a [[Haute Qualité Environnementale|HQE]] Building with solar panels and two windmills to provide as electrical supply. The stadium is fully accessible by metro stations and road and includes 7,000 parking spaces.

===Tenants===
The Grand Stade received a five-star UEFA ranking. It is expected to significantly increase the revenue streams of [[Lille OSC]], its tenant club.

The stadium hosted its first rugby union Test match on 17 November 2012 during the [[2012 end-of-year rugby union tests|2012 Autumn Internationals]], when [[France national rugby union team|France]] defeated [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] 39–22.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espnscrum.com/argentina-tour-2012/rugby/match/154936.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Blind Side''''' is a 2009 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Sports film|sports]] [[drama film]] written and directed by [[John Lee Hancock]], based on the 2006 book ''[[The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game]]'' by [[Michael Lewis]].&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118001814.html |author=Dave McNary|title=Kathy Bates to star in 'Blind Side'|work=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date=March 27, 2009|accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0878804/ | title = The Blind Side (2009) | publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] | date = April 22, 2009 | accessdate = May 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline features [[Michael Oher]], an [[offensive lineman]] who was drafted by the [[Baltimore Ravens]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The film follows Oher from his impoverished upbringing, through his years at Wingate Christian School (a fictional representation of [[Briarcrest Christian School]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2009/nov/24/briarcrest-opted-out-of-blind-side-feature-role/ Briarcrest opted out of feature role in 'The Blind Side'] from CommercialAppeal.com&lt;/ref&gt; his adoption by [[Sean Tuohy|Sean]] and [[Leigh Anne Tuohy]], to his position as one of the most highly coveted prospects in [[college football]], then finally becoming a first-round pick of the Ravens.

[[Quinton Aaron]] stars as Michael Oher, alongside [[Sandra Bullock]] as Leigh Anne Tuohy, [[Tim McGraw]] as Sean Tuohy, and [[Kathy Bates]] as Miss Sue, Oher's tutor.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; The film also features appearances by several current and former [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] coaches, including [[Houston Nutt]], [[Ed Orgeron]], [[Nick Saban]], [[Lou Holtz]], [[Tommy Tuberville]], and [[Phillip Fulmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&amp;id=4277330 | title = Prominent coaches turn actors for film | author = Schlabach, Mark | publisher = [[ESPN]] | date = June 29, 2009 | accessdate = July 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Blind Side'' grossed over $300 million. Bullock went on to win the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], as well as the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role]]. The film also received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], which was considered a surprise for the producers and led the Academy to change their requirements for Best Picture nominations.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400 to 700 words. --&gt;
The film opens with seventeen-year-old Michael ("Big Mike") Oher talking to an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] investigator. Then a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] ensues.

Michael has been in foster care with different families in Memphis, Tennessee, due to his mother's drug addiction. Every time he is placed in a new home, he runs away. His friend's father, on whose couch Mike had been sleeping, asks Burt Cotton, the coach of Wingate Christian School, to help enroll his son and Mike. Impressed by Mike's size and athleticism, Cotton gets him admitted despite his poor academic record. Later, Michael is befriended by a younger student named Sean Jr. ("SJ"). SJ's mother, Leigh Anne Tuohy, is a strong-minded interior designer and the wife of wealthy businessman Sean Tuohy. 

The school staff tell Michael that his father has died, apparently due to an accident. Later, Leigh Anne and Sean watch their daughter Collins playing volleyball. After the game, Sean notices Michael picking up leftover food on the bleachers.

One night, Leigh Anne notices Michael walking alone on the moist road, shivering in the cold without adequate clothing. When she learns that he plans to spend the night huddled outside the closed school gym, Leigh Anne offers to let him sleep on the couch in the Tuohy home.
 
The next morning, Leigh Anne notices that Michael has left. Seeing him walking away, she asks him to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with her family. Slowly, Michael becomes a member of the family. Later, Leigh Anne drives Michael to his mother's house. He sees an eviction notice posted on the door, and his mother is gone.
 
Leigh Anne's friends wonder what she is doing; they suggest that Collins might not be safe around Michael, but Leigh Anne rebukes them. She later asks Collins how she feels about it. Collins replies that they cannot just throw Michael out. When Leigh Anne seeks to become Michael's legal guardian, she learns he was taken from his drug-addict mother when he was seven and that no one knows her whereabouts. She is also told that, although he scored poorly in a career aptitude test, he was ranked in the 98th percentile in "protective instincts". When Michael appears to be hesitant to use his strength and size while learning to play football, Leigh Anne tells him, as an offensive lineman, he must protect his quarterback. From that moment, Michael improves drastically, well enough to play at the college level. However, to do that, he must meet the minimum [[Grading (education)|grade point average]] to get in so the Tuohys hire a private tutor for him, the outspoken and kind Miss Sue.

Leigh Anne has a face-to-face conversation with Michael's mother about adopting him. Although she seems unresponsive in the beginning, the mother finally wishes Michael the best.

Michael is heavily recruited by many prestigious schools. SJ talks to coaches and negotiates on Michael's behalf – and his own. When Michael gets his grades high enough, he decides to attend Ole Miss, where Sean had played and Leigh Anne had been a cheerleader. That causes NCAA investigator Granger to look into the matter to determine if the Tuohys took him in and unduly influenced him just so he would play for their [[alma mater]].

Michael runs away before the interview is over and confronts Leigh Anne about her motives for taking him in. He then proceeds to find his biological mother in Hurt Village. A gang leader welcomes him back, offers him a beer, and makes sexually offensive insinuations about Leigh Anne and Collins. When the gang leader threatens to go after them, Michael battles with him and other thugs. After thinking things over and questioning Leigh Anne, Michael tells Granger he chose Ole Miss because "it's where my family goes to school". Michael is accepted into college and says his farewells to the Tuohy family. 

The film ends with information about and photos of the real Tuohy family and Michael Oher, who went on to play in the [[National Football League]]. He was drafted by the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in the first round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]].

''The Blind Side'' was produced by [[Alcon Entertainment]] and released by [[Warner Bros.]] The film's production budget was $29 million.&lt;ref name="www.boxofficemojo.com" /&gt; Filming for the school scenes took place at [[Atlanta International School]] and [[The Westminster Schools]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and it features many of their students as extras.

{{Expand section|date=September 2017}}&lt;!-- comments from individual critics needed, not just an overview --&gt;

====Race controversy====

''The Blind Side'' has been criticized as presenting a [[White savior narrative in film|white savior narrative]] in which Oher, an African-American male, is unable to overcome poverty and personal failure without the guidance of adoptive, white mother Tuohy. For example, Jeffrey Montez de Oca of the [[University of Colorado]] writes that in ''The Blind Side''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s portrayal of [[adoption]], "charity operates as a signifying act of whiteness that obscures the social relations of domination that not only make charity possible but also creates an urban underclass in need of charity."&lt;ref&gt;Montez de Oca, J. (2012). White Domestic Goddess on a Postmodern Plantation: Charity and Commodity Racism in The Blind Side. Sociology Of Sport Journal, 29(2), 131–150.&lt;/ref&gt; Melissa Anderson of the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' argues that the "mute, docile" portrayal of Oher effectively endorses the [[Uncle Tom]] stereotype of African-American submission to white authority.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Anderson, [http://www.dallasobserver.com/2009-11-19/film/the-blind-side-what-would-black-people-do-without-nice-white-folks/ ''The Blind Side'': What Would Black People Do Without Nice White Folks?], 19 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oher was later quoted as saying that "It's a great story. It seems like they helped me to get to this point. They're my family and without them I wouldn't be here," and "They taught me a lot of things, showed me a lot of different things. It shows that if you help somebody and give somebody a chance and don't judge people, look where they can get to."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/us-sports/super-bowl-50-the-blind-side-michael-oher-feels-wanted-at-carolina-panthers-ahead-of-showpiece-20160128-gmgmep.html|title=Super Bowl 50: 'The Blind Side' Michael Oher feels wanted at Carolina Panthers|last=Person|first=Joseph|date=2016-01-29|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
