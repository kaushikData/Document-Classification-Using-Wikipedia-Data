'''Agriplace''' is an [[industrial park]] located in the [[North Industrial SDA, Saskatoon|North Industrial SDA]] Suburban Development Area of [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]. Industrial parks are usually located close to [[transport]] facilities, especially where [[intermodal freight transport|more than one transport modalities]] coincide.   [[Saskatchewan Highway 16|Sk Hwy 16, the Yellowhead]], [[Saskatchewan Highway 11|Sk Hwy 11]], and Sk Hwy 11 are all accessed directly from Agriplace. The [[Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport]] is southwest of the Sk Hwy 16, the Yellowhead highway.

==Geography==
The land was annexed from the [[rural municipality]] of [[Corman Park No. 344, Saskatchewan|Corman Park]] between 1980 and 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agriplace subdivision is nestled between three major trucking routes. Sk Hwy 16, the Yellowhead departs Saskatoon to North Battleford to the north west. Sk Hwy 11 to [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] via [[Warman, Saskatchewan|Warman]], and  [[Saskatchewan Highway 12|Sk Hwy 12]] to [[Blaine Lake]] via [[Martensville, Saskatchewan|Martensville]] mark the eastern boundary. 71st Street is the northern perimeter of the industrial park.

==History==
First laid out in the early 1980s, Agriplace became well known to Saskatonians through the decision to replace the original downtown [[Saskatoon Arena]] with a new indoor arena facility. Three major locations were considered: on the site of a decommissioned power plant just west of the original Arena location (lands now part of [[River Landing]]), a site in the [[North Industrial, Saskatoon|North Industrial]] district east of Idylwyld Drive, and a site in the south portion of the yet-to-be-developed Agriplace. Ultimately, Agriplace was chosen for the location of Saskatchewan Place (later renamed [[Credit Union Centre]]), an initially controversial decision due to Agriplace's remote location relative to the rest of the city and the fact accessing the area requires driving on freeways (it was not until the extension of Marquis Drive in the early 2010s that motorists from Saskatoon were given a non-freeway/non-service road option for accessing the area).

At one point the City of Saskatoon also pursued plans to relocate the city's exhibition grounds onto lands adjacent to the new arena and north of 60th Street West, but public opposition and lack of space led to this plan being dropped by the late 1980s.

Agriplace also received some additional notoriety when it first appeared on City maps. One of the area's major streets carries the name "Thatcher Avenue"; it appeared on maps the same year former MLA [[Colin Thatcher]] was on trial for murder, a sensational case that attracted international attention. In this case, however, the street wasn't named for Thatcher nor his father, former Saskatchewan Premier [[Ross Thatcher]], but rather for a species of wheat, in keeping with the general naming conventions in the area.

In 2003, Saunders Avenue, one of the access roads into Credit Union Centre, was renamed [[Bill Hunter (ice hockey)|Bill Hunter]] Avenue in honor of the hockey manager and promoter who attempted to get the [[St. Louis Blues]] [[National Hockey League]] team transferred to Saskatoon in the 1980s. The renaming was noted with irony as Hunter opposed the Agriplace location of the arena.

==Economy==
The agriplace industrial park is a mix of commercial and industrial concerns. [[Costco]], a members only bulk grocery and department store, is a major employer in the agriplace district.  [[Sasktel Centre]] formerly named Credit Union Centre, and Saskatchewan Place is a 12000-seat arena hosting sporting, concert and large events to Saskatoon. Canlan Ice Sports Agriplace Centre is located on Apex Street. The Husky truck stop has relocated from Circle Drive to Agriplace. Motel 6 an Tim Hortons have opened near the Husky.

In the Agriplace subdivision are located 48 sectors giving employment to 780 full-time employees and 221 part-time employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Brazilian Penal Code]] defines an official or civil servant as follows: "Article 327 - ... those who, although temporarily or without pay, hold a position, employment or public usefulness. § 1 - Equivalent to a public official who holds a position, job or function in parastatal entity, and who works for the company providing the service or the private contractor for the execution of activity typical of public administration. "

==Legal Regime of Civil Servants==
Originally, the [[Constitution of Brazil]] had established a single legal regime that would apply to Federal entities for all hires. Subsequently, Constitutional Amendment number 19 relaxed this requirement by establishing the possibility of adopting the statutory regime or Hired Under Employment Laws, but was reinstated after the foregoing assessment of ADIn 2135.
The regulation of the legal regime of civil servants federal government, local and federal public foundations is carried out in Brazil under Federal Law no. 8.112/1990. Are not included in the legal regime established by this Act that federal employees are governed by the dictates of the [[Consolidation of Labor Laws]] and Federal Law no. 9.962/2000.
It should be understood that under the Federal Constitution of 1988, both regimes must respect constitutionally established rules, for example, all accepted by the public employer shall be subject to a tender or selection process.

Thus, in Brazil so-called statutory servants (connected to the system of Federal Law no. 8112) and servants called ''celetistas'', which obey the Consolidation of Labor Laws.
However, in order to grant interim with ''[[ex nunc]]'' effect on the date of August 2, 2007 ADIn in 2135, which suspended the effectiveness of EC 19 in that it modifies the chapeau of Article 39 for violation of the CF/1988 Article 60, II, of CF/1988 (vice-initiative), the Legal One has been restored.

==Tenure==
The term ''civil servant'' and ''tenured servant'' appear in the [[Constitution of Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil |quote=Constitutional text of October 5, 1988, with the alterations introduced by Constitutional Amendments No. 1/1992 through 64/2010 and by Revision Constitutional Amendments No. 1/1994 through 6/1994; translation: year 2010, 3rd edition. |publisher=[[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]], Documentation and Information Center, Publishing Coordination |year=1988 |url=http://english.tse.jus.br/arquivos/federal-constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 41 of the Federal Constitution states that "Servants who, by virtue of public entrance examinations, are appointed to effective posts, acquire tenure after three years of actual service."

Civil servants are listed as a category of public servants: they are permanent staff, professionals in the service of public administration. The [[Penal Code of Brazil|Brazilian Penal Code]], however, refers to a public official, which has a broader scope than the public servant. A board member, for example, who exercises a public function (help in the electoral process), is a civilian employee (in respect of acts performed as a board member), despite a transient and unpaid public role.

==Entrance==
Filling is the administrative act of filling public office in Brazil regulated by Law No. 8112 of November 11, 1990 [1].
Under the legislation, the provision may be given by appointment, promotion, rehabilitation, recovery, recovery, reintegration and renewal.Each of these forms of provision has a special significance in public administration and specify the legal form of access to public office in Brazil.

==Compensation==
The fee payment for services rendered to the state civil servant is given as follows:
*I Maturity: the cash consideration for the exercise of public office, with the rate fixed by law;
*II Remuneration: Salary is the effective position, plus the permanent pecuniary advantages determined by law;
*III Grant: is the exclusive and fixed fee payment in a lump sum, sealed the addition of any bonus, extra, bonus, award, grant or other type of representation remuneration. This type of pay is not the general rule and applies to cases that the law specify;
Earning. 
*IV: the return of money paid to exercente of public office when going from activity to inactivity, or when he retires;
*V board: cash is retribution paid to the persons to whom the law attributes the condition of receiving the public servant who died.
CF/88 Article 39 § 4: The State of Power, the holder of an elective office, Ministers of State and Municipal and State Secretaries shall be paid exclusively by fixed allowance in a lump sum, sealed the addition of any bonus, additional allowance, award, grant or other type of representation remuneration, obeyed in any case the provisions of art. 37, X and X
Any salary within the public service may exceed the value of allowances paid to Justices of the Supreme Court (STF) and the salaries of the offices of the Legislative and the Judiciary can not be higher than those paid by the executive. Despite these rules exist, many people are wondering if they are indeed obeyed.

BI technologies can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help identify, develop and otherwise create new strategic [[business opportunities]]. They aim to allow for the easy interpretation of these [[big data]]. Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy based on [[insight]]s can provide [[business]]es with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book |title= Business Intelligence Success Factors: Tools for Aligning Your Business in the Global Economy |last= Rud|first= Olivia |year= 2009|publisher= Wiley &amp; Sons|location= Hoboken, N.J|isbn= 978-0-470-39240-9 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Business intelligence can be used by enterprises to support a wide range of business decisions ranging from operational to strategic. Basic operating decisions include product positioning or pricing.  [[Business strategy|Strategic business]] decisions involve priorities, [[goal]]s and directions at the broadest level. In all cases, BI is most effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a [[company]] operates (external data) with data from company sources internal to the business such as financial and operations data (internal data). When combined, external and internal data can provide a complete picture which, in effect, creates an "intelligence" that cannot be derived from any singular set of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Coker| first1= Frank | title= Pulse: Understanding the Vital Signs of Your Business | publisher= Ambient Light Publishing

==History==
The earliest known use of the term ''business intelligence'' is in Richard Millar Devens' ''Cyclopædia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes'' (1865). Devens used the term to describe how the banker [[Sir Henry Furnese, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Furnese]] gained profit by receiving and acting upon information about his environment, prior to his competitors:
{{quote|Throughout Holland, Flanders, France, and Germany, he maintained a complete and perfect train of business intelligence. The news of the many battles fought was thus received first by him, and the [[Siege of Namur (1695)|fall of Namur]] added to his profits, owing to his early receipt of the news.|author=Devens |source=p.&amp;nbsp;210}}

The ability to collect and react accordingly based on the information retrieved, Devens says, is central to business intelligence.&lt;ref name="Miller Devens"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller Devens|first=Richard|title=Cyclopaedia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes; Comprising Interesting Reminiscences and Facts, Remarkable Traits and Humors of Merchants, Traders, Bankers Etc. in All Ages and Countries|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=9MspAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=%22business+intelligence%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a5EPTdaRIsOWnAeVyYHQDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22business%20intelligence%22&amp;f=false|publisher=D. Appleton and company|accessdate=15 February 2014|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Hans Peter Luhn]], a researcher at [[IBM]], used the term ''business intelligence'' in an article published in 1958, he employed the ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' definition of intelligence: "the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way as to guide action towards a desired goal."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url= http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/024/ibmrd0204H.pdf|doi=10.1147/rd.24.0314|title= A Business Intelligence System|author=H P Luhn |authorlink= Hans Peter Luhn |year= 1958 |journal= IBM Journal|volume= 2|issue= 4|pages= 314|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913121526/http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/024/ibmrd0204H.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-13}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Business intelligence as it is understood today is said to have evolved from the [[decision support system]]s (DSS) that began in the 1960s and developed throughout the mid-1980s.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} DSS originated in the computer-aided models created to assist with [[decision making]] and planning.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1989, Howard Dresner (later a [[Gartner]] analyst) proposed ''business intelligence'' as an [[umbrella term]] to describe "concepts and methods to improve business decision making by using fact-based support systems."&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dssresources.com/history/dsshistory.html |title= A Brief History of Decision Support Systems, version 4.0 |accessdate=10 July 2008 |author= D. J. Power |date= 10 March 2007|publisher= DSSResources.COM }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1990s that this usage was widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dssresources.com/history/dsshistory.html |title=A Brief History of Decision Support Systems |last=Power |first=D. J. |accessdate=1 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics{{who|date=August 2018}} see BI merely as an evolution of [[business reporting]] together with the advent of increasingly powerful and easy-to-use [[data analysis]] tools. In this respect it has also been criticized{{by whom|date=August 2018}} as a marketing buzzword in the context of the "[[big data]]" surge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decoding big data buzzwords|year=2015|quote=BI refers to the approaches, tools, mechanisms that organizations can use to keep a finger on the pulse of their businesses. Also referred by unsexy versions -- “dashboarding”, “MIS” or “reporting.”|publisher=cio.com|url=http://www.cio.com/article/2919082/big-data/what-are-they-talking-about-decoding-big-data-buzzwords.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to [[Forrester Research]], business intelligence is "a set of methodologies, processes, architectures, and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information used to enable more effective strategic, tactical, and operational insights and decision-making."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forrester.com/report/Topic+Overview+Business+Intelligence/-/E-RES39218 |title=Topic Overview: Business Intelligence |last=Evelson |first=Boris |date=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, business intelligence encompasses [[information management]] ([[data integration]], [[data quality]], data warehousing, master-data management, text- and content-analytics, et al.). Therefore, Forrester refers to ''data preparation'' and ''data usage'' as two separate but closely linked segments of the business-intelligence architectural stack.

Some elements of business intelligence are:{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

* Multidimensional [[Aggregate (data warehouse)|aggregation]] and allocation
* [[Denormalization]], tagging, and standardization
* Realtime reporting with analytical alert
* A method of interfacing with [[unstructured data]] sources
* Group consolidation, budgeting and [[rolling forecast]]s
* [[Statistical inference]] and probabilistic simulation
* [[Key performance indicator]]s optimization
* Version control and process management
* Open item management

Forrester distinguishes this from the ''business-intelligence market'', which is "just the top layers of the BI architectural stack, such as [[Data reporting|reporting]], [[analytics]], and [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboards]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://blogs.forrester.com/boris_evelson/10-04-29-want_know_what_forresters_lead_data_analysts_are_thinking_about_bi_and_data_domain
|title=Want to know what Forrester's lead data analysts are thinking about BI and the data domain? |last=Evelson |first=Boris |date=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compared with competitive intelligence===
Though the term business intelligence is sometimes a synonym for [[competitive intelligence]] (because they both support [[decision making]]), BI uses technologies, processes, and applications to analyze mostly internal, structured data and business processes while competitive intelligence gathers, analyzes and disseminates information with a topical focus on company competitors. If understood broadly, business intelligence can include the subset of competitive intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.forrester.com/james_kobielus/10-04-30-what%E2%80%99s_not_bi_oh_don%E2%80%99t_get_me_startedoops_too_latehere_goes |title=What’s Not BI? Oh, Don’t Get Me Started....Oops Too Late...Here Goes.... |last=Kobielus |first=James |date=30 April 2010 |quote=“Business” intelligence is a non-domain-specific catchall for all the types of analytic data that can be delivered to users in reports, dashboards, and the like. When you specify the subject domain for this intelligence, then you can refer to “competitive intelligence,” “market intelligence,” “social intelligence,” “financial intelligence,” “HR intelligence,” “supply chain intelligence,” and the like.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compared with business analytics===
Business intelligence and [[business analytics]] are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are alternate definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timoelliott.com/blog/2011/03/business-analytics-vs-business-intelligence.html |title=Business Analytics vs Business Intelligence? |publisher=timoelliott.com |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas H. Davenport|Thomas Davenport]], professor of information technology and management at [[Babson College]] argues that business intelligence should be divided into [[Information retrieval|querying]], [[Business reporting|reporting]], [[Online analytical processing]] (OLAP), an "alerts" tool, and business analytics. In this definition, business analytics is the subset of BI focusing on statistics, prediction, and optimization, rather than the reporting functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/bi/222200096 |title=Analytics at Work: Q&amp;A with Tom Davenport |last=Henschen |first=Doug |date=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components of the BI landscape==
The Business Intelligence landscape reflects the complex system which data goes through in order to get processed into information. One of the first steps of starting a BI program, is to understand all components of this landscape. The particularities of this system tend to differ based on the industry and organization, but at a macro level, all BI landscapes have the same format. It’s usually composed of five pillars and five foundation blocks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lightsondata.com/business-intelligence-landscape-components/|title=10 components of the Business Intelligence landscape - LightsOnData|date=2018-07-04|work=LightsOnData|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

The five pillars:

# Data source(s)
# Data integration
# Data management
# Reports 
# Information dissemination

The five foundation blocks:

# Information security
# Data quality
# Metadata management
# Data governance
# People &amp; culture

==Data==
Business operations can generate a very large amount of information in the form of e-mails, memos, notes from call-centers, news, user groups, chats, reports, web-pages, presentations, image-files, video-files, and marketing material. According to [[Merrill Lynch]], more than 85% of all business information exists in these forms; a company might only use such a document a single time.&lt;ref name = rao&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/MITP.2003.1254966 |url=http://www.ramanarao.com/papers/rao-itpro-2003-11.pdf|title=From unstructured data to actionable intelligence|year=2003|last1=Rao|first1=R.|journal=IT Professional|volume=5|issue=6|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the way it is produced and stored, this information is either [[Unstructured data|unstructured]] or [[semi-structured data|semi-structured]].

The management of semi-structured data is an unsolved problem in the information technology industry.&lt;ref name=blumberg&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://soquelgroup.com/Articles/dmreview_0203_problem.pdf|author1=Blumberg, R.|author2=S. Atre|lastauthoramp=yes|title=The Problem with Unstructured Data|journal=DM Review|year=2003|pages=42–46|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125033210/http://soquelgroup.com/Articles/dmreview_0203_problem.pdf|archivedate=25 January 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to projections from Gartner (2003), white collar workers spend 30–40% of their time searching, finding, and assessing unstructured data. BI uses both structured and unstructured data. The former is easy to search, and the latter contains a large quantity of the information needed for analysis and decision making.&lt;ref name = blumberg /&gt;&lt;ref name = negash&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://site.xavier.edu/sena/info600/businessintelligence.pdf|author=Negash, S |title=Business Intelligence|journal= Communications of the Association of Information Systems|volume=13|year= 2004|pages=177–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the difficulty of properly searching, finding and assessing unstructured or semi-structured data, organizations may not draw upon these vast reservoirs of information, which could influence a particular decision, task or project. This can ultimately lead to poorly informed decision making.&lt;ref name = rao /&gt;

Therefore, when designing a business intelligence/DW-solution, the specific problems associated with semi-structured and unstructured data must be accommodated for as well as those for the structured data.&lt;ref name = negash /&gt;

===Unstructured data vs. semi-structured data===
Unstructured and semi-structured data have different meanings depending on their context. In the context of relational database systems, unstructured data cannot be stored in predictably ordered [[columns]] and [[Row (database)|rows]]. One type of unstructured data is typically stored in a [[BLOB]] (binary large object), a catch-all data type available in most [[relational database]] management systems. Unstructured data may also refer to irregularly or randomly repeated (nonrepetitive) column patterns that vary from row to row within each file or document.&lt;ref name="InmonUntang14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/untangling-definition-unstructured-data |title=Untangling the Definition of Unstructured Data |author=Inmon, W.H. |work=Big Data &amp; Analytics Hub |publisher=IBM |date=25 July 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these data types, however, like e-mails, word processing text files, PPTs, image-files, and video-files conform to a standard that offers the possibility of metadata. Metadata can include information such as author and time of creation, and this can be stored in a relational database.
Therefore, it may be more accurate to talk about this as semi-structured documents or data,&lt;ref name = blumberg /&gt; but no specific consensus seems to have been reached.

Unstructured data can also simply be the knowledge that business users have about future business trends. Business forecasting naturally aligns with the BI system because business users think of their business in aggregate terms. Capturing the business knowledge that may only exist in the minds of business users provides some of the most important data points for a complete BI solution.

===Limitations of semi-structured and unstructured data===
There are several challenges to developing BI with semi-structured data. According to Inmon &amp; Nesavich,&lt;ref name = inmon&gt;Inmon, B. &amp; A. Nesavich, "Unstructured Textual Data in the Organization" from "Managing Unstructured data in the organization", Prentice Hall 2008, pp. 1–13&lt;/ref&gt; some of those are:

* Physically accessing unstructured textual data&amp;nbsp;– unstructured data is stored in a huge variety of formats.
* [[Terminology]]&amp;nbsp;– Among researchers and analysts, there is a need to develop a standardized terminology.
* Volume of data&amp;nbsp;– As stated earlier, up to 85% of all data exists as semi-structured data. Couple that with the need for word-to-word and semantic analysis.
* Searchability of unstructured textual data&amp;nbsp;– A simple search on some data, e.g. apple, results in links where there is a reference to that precise search term. (Inmon &amp; Nesavich, 2008)&lt;ref name = inmon /&gt; gives an example: “a search is made on the term felony. In a simple search, the term felony is used, and everywhere there is a reference to felony, a hit to an unstructured document is made. But a simple search is crude. It does not find references to crime, arson, murder, embezzlement, vehicular homicide, and such, even though these crimes are types of felonies.”

===Metadata===
To solve problems with searchability and assessment of data, it is necessary to know something about the content. This can be done by adding context through the use of [[metadata]].&lt;ref name = rao /&gt; Many systems already capture some metadata (e.g. filename, author, size, etc.), but more useful would be metadata about the actual content&amp;nbsp;– e.g. summaries, topics, people or companies mentioned. Two technologies designed for generating metadata about content are automatic categorization and [[information extraction]].

==Applications==
Business intelligence can be applied to the following business purposes:&lt;ref name="FeldmanDeveloping13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDXfeopC-kMC&amp;pg=PA140 |title=Developing Business Intelligence Apps for SharePoint |author=Feldman, D.; Himmelstein, J. |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc |pages=140–1 |year=2013 |isbn=9781449324681 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Performance metrics]] and [[benchmarking]] inform business leaders of progress towards business goals ([[business process management]]).
* [[Analytics]] quantify processes for a business to arrive at optimal decisions, and to perform business knowledge discovery. Analytics may variously involve [[data mining]], [[process mining]], [[statistical analysis]], [[predictive analytics]], [[predictive modeling]], [[business process modeling]], [[data lineage]], [[complex event processing]] and [[prescriptive analytics]].
* [[Business reporting]] can use BI data to inform strategy. Business reporting may involve [[data visualization]], [[executive information system]], and/or [[OLAP]]
* BI can facilitate [[collaboration]] both inside and outside the business by enabling [[data sharing]] and [[electronic data interchange]]
* [[Knowledge management]] is concerned with the creation, distribution, use, and management of business intelligence, and of business knowledge in general. Knowledge management leads to [[learning management]] and [[regulatory compliance]].

==Marketplace==
In a 2013 report, Gartner categorized business intelligence vendors as either an independent "pure-play" vendor or a consolidated "megavendor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/gartner-releases-2013-bi-magic-quadrant-7000011264/ |title=Gartner releases 2013 BI Magic Quadrant |publisher=ZDNet |author=Andrew Brust| date= 2013-02-14|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bi-verdict.com/fileadmin/FreeAnalyses/consolidations.htm |title=Consolidations in the BI industry |date=7 March 2008 |last=Pendse |first=Nigel |work=The OLAP Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 business intelligence services received $13.1 billion in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gartner Says Worldwide Business Intelligence, CPM and Analytic Applications/Performance Management Software Market Grew Seven Percent in 2012 |url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2507915 |website=Gartner.com |accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical predictions===
A 2009 paper predicted&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=856714 Gartner Reveals Five Business Intelligence Predictions for 2009 and Beyond]. gartner.com. 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; these developments in the business intelligence market:

* Because of lack of information, processes, and tools, through 2012, more than 35 percent of the top 5,000 global companies regularly fail to make insightful decisions about significant changes in their business and markets.
* By 2012, business units will control at least 40 percent of the total budget for business intelligence.
* By 2012, one-third of analytic applications applied to business processes will be delivered through [[Granularity|coarse-grained]] application [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]].

A 2009 ''Information Management'' special report predicted the top BI trends: "[[green computing]], [[social networking service]]s, [[data visualization]], [[Mobile business intelligence|mobile BI]], [[predictive analytics]], [[composite application]]s, [[cloud computing]] and [[Multi-touch|multitouch]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.information-management.com/specialreports/2009_148/business_intelligence_data_vizualization_social_networking_analytics-10015628-1.html |title=10 Red Hot BI Trends |last=Campbell |first=Don |date=23 June 2009 |work=Information Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research undertaken in 2014 indicated that employees are more likely to have access to, and more likely to engage with, cloud-based BI tools than traditional tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aberdeen.com/Aberdeen-Library/8906/RR-analytics-cloud-saas-bi.aspx |title=Cloud Analytics in 2014: Infusing the Workforce with Insight |last=Lock|first=Michael|date=27 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other business intelligence trends include the following:
* Third party SOA-BI products increasingly address [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] issues of volume and throughput.
* Companies embrace in-memory processing, 64-bit processing, and pre-packaged analytic BI applications.
* Operational applications have callable BI components, with improvements in response time, scaling, and concurrency.
* Near or real time BI analytics is a baseline expectation.
* Open source BI software replaces vendor offerings.

Other lines of research include the combined study of business intelligence and uncertain data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Instead, data is considered uncertain and therefore this uncertainty is propagated to the results produced by BI.

According to a study by the Aberdeen Group, there has been increasing interest in [[Software-as-a-Service]] (SaaS) business intelligence over the past years, with twice as many organizations using this deployment approach as one year ago&amp;nbsp;– 15% in 2009 compared to 7% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Julian|first1=Taylor|title=Business intelligence implementation according to customer's needs|url=http://apro-software.com/services/software-development/business-intelligence|publisher=APRO Software|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article by InfoWorld's Chris Kanaracus points out similar growth data from research firm IDC, which predicts the SaaS BI market will grow 22 percent each year through 2013 thanks to increased product sophistication, strained IT budgets, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/saas-bi-growth-will-soar-in-2010-511 SaaS BI growth will soar in 2010 | Cloud Computing].

The '''[[Canadian National Railway]] (C.N.) Yards Management Area''' located on Chappell Drive, [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]] consists of the VIA [[Saskatoon railway station]] and the train switching yards.  These yards are a part of the [[Confederation SDA, Saskatoon|Confederation Suburban Development Area (SDA)]].  It lies (generally) north of the outskirts of the City and the [[Rural Municipality]] of [[Corman Park No. 344, Saskatchewan|Corman Park No. 344]], west of [[Montgomery Place, Saskatoon|Montgomery Place]], south of 11th Street and east of [[Saskatchewan Highway 7|Highway 7]].  [[Saskatchewan Highway 7|Highway 7]] has built an overpass over C.N. tracks where they intersect.  This neighbourhood is not to be confused with the [[C.N. Industrial, Saskatoon|C.N. Industrial]] in the [[Nutana SDA, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Nutana SDA]] on the east side of Saskatoon.  These two sides of Saskatoon are connected with the [[Grand Trunk Bridge (Saskatoon)|Grand Trunk Bridge]] or CN railway bridge over the [[South Saskatchewan River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.saskatoon.sk.ca/org/city_planning/resources/publications/Future_Growth_and_Development_of_Saskatoon.pdf Selling an Idea or a Product] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104633/http://www.city.saskatoon.sk.ca/org/city_planning/resources/publications/Future_Growth_and_Development_of_Saskatoon.pdf |date=2007-09-29 }} URL accessed January 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

At the intersection of the CNR line and [[Saskatchewan Highway 60|Highway 60]] is the location of the [[Saskatchewan Railway Museum]].

Currently there are CPR switching yards in the [[Central Industrial, Saskatoon|Central Industrial]] neighbourhood.  The City of Saskatoon, [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and the CNR are under negotiations currently to remove these switching yards.  This would mean the CPR could use CNR rail lines through the city and be able to use the CN Chappell Yards for switching.  Likeise the CNR could run trains along the CPR track through the city and use the [[Sutherland Industrial, Saskatoon|Sutherland]] CPR switching yards.  This would involve construction of a connecting switching yard between CP and CN rail lines near 11th Street and Dundonald which could be done as part of the new [[Circle Drive#South bridge|Circle Drive South Bridge]] extension project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Image:Newfoundlandcodfishing.jpg|thumb|right|Cod fishing on the Newfoundland Banks]]
'''Cod fishing in Newfoundland''' was carried out at a [[subsistence]] level for centuries, but large scale fishing began shortly after the [[European colonization of the Americas|European discovery of the North American continent]] in 1492, with the waters being found to be [[preternaturally]] plentiful, and ended after intense [[overfishing]] with the collapse of the fisheries in 1992.

==Native Canadian fishing==
The [[Beothuk]] (called [[Skraelings]] by the [[Vikings]]) were the native people of Newfoundland, and survived on a diet of caribou, marine mammals and fish. With the arrival of British and French coastal settlements, the Beothuk were forced inland, and the lack of their normal food source contributed to a decrease in the Beothuk population. Beothuk numbers began to dwindle rapidly due to a combination of factors directly relating to European, Inuit and Mi'kmaq migration, and by the 19th Century, the tribe no longer existed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/aboriginal/beothuk-disappearance.php Disappearance of the Beothuk] ''Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage''. Accessed 19 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigorrin.org/beothuk_kids.htm|title=Facts for kids:Beothuk Indians|publisher=Native Languages of the Americas|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==15th and 16th centuries==
After his voyage in 1497, [[John Cabot]]'s crew reported that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;the sea there is full of fish that can be taken not only with nets but with fishing-baskets.&lt;ref name="ccc"&gt;{{cite web|

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and around 1600 English fishing captains still reported cod shoals 

&lt;blockquote&gt;so thick by the shore that we hardly have been able to row a boat through them.&lt;ref name="emagazine"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early sixteenth century, fishermen from England, France, Spain and Portugal discovered the best places to fish for [[Atlantic cod|cod]] in the waters off [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], and how best to [[Fish preservation|preserve]] the fish for the journey home.&lt;ref name="Ryan1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdli.ca/cod/history5.htm |title=History of Newfoundland Cod Fishery |publisher= |accessdate=2008-06-20 |last=Ryan |first=Shannon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218165112/http://www.cdli.ca/cod/history5.htm |archivedate=December 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French, Spanish and Portuguese fishermen tended to fish on the [[Grand Banks]] and other banks out to sea, where fish were always available. They [[Salting (food)|salted]] their fish on board ship and it was not [[Drying (food)|dried]] until brought to Europe. The English fishermen, however, concentrated on fishing inshore where the fish were only to be found at certain times of the year, during their [[Fish migration|migration]]s. These fishermen used small boats and returned to shore every day. They developed a system of light salting, washing and drying onshore which became very popular because the fish could remain edible for years.&lt;ref name="ccc"/&gt; Many of their coastal sites gradually developed into settlements, notably [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]],&lt;ref name="Ryan1"/&gt; now the provincial capital.

In the late sixteenth century the Spanish and Portuguese [[Fishery|fisheries]] were terminated, mainly as a result of the failure of the [[Spanish Armada]],&lt;ref name="ccc"/&gt; and thereafter the English and French shared the fishery every summer until 1904 when the French agreed to relinquish it to the Newfoundland residents.&lt;ref name="Ryan1"/&gt;
&lt;!-- What happened thereafter? More research needed. --&gt;

==20th century fishing methods and the fishery collapse==

In 1951 [[factory ship|factory fishing]] began with new super-trawlers such as the 'Fairtry'; 280 feet long and 2,600 gross tons.&lt;ref name="emagazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emagazine.com/archive/507|title=A Run on the Banks How "Factory Fishing" Decimated Newfoundland Cod|date=March 2001|publisher=E/The Environmental Magazine!|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cod catch peaked in 1968 at 810,000 tons, approximately three times more than the maximum yearly catch achieved before the super-trawlers. Approximately 8 million tons of cod were caught between 1647 and 1750, a period encompassing 25 to 40 cod generations. The factory trawlers took the same amount in 15 years.&lt;ref name=myers&gt;{{cite journal|author1=RA Myers |author2=JA Hutchings |author3=NJ Barrowman |year=1997 |title=WHY DO FISH STOCKS COLLAPSE?

The industry collapsed entirely in the early 1990s owing to overfishing and debatably, greed, lack of foresight and poor local administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/cbio/cancod.html|title=CANADIAN ATLANTIC FISHERIES COLLAPSE|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=2009-01-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125141918/http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/cbio/cancod.html|archivedate=2009-01-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1993 six cod populations had collapsed, forcing a belated moratorium on fishing.&lt;ref name=myers/&gt; Spawning biomass had decreased by at least 75% in all stocks, by 90% in three of the six stocks, and by 99% in the case of 'northern' cod, previously the largest cod fishery in the world.&lt;ref name=myers/&gt;

After a 10-year moratorium on fishing begun in 1992, the cod had still not returned.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;  It was thought that the local ecosystem might have changed, one possibility being that greater numbers of [[capelin]], which used to provide food for the cod, might be eating the juvenile cod.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The waters appeared to be dominated by crab and shrimp rather than fish.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2580733.stm|title=Cod's warning from Newfoundland|last=Hirsch|first=Tim|date=2002-12-16|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2011 it became apparent that the fisheries were returning to their original abundance, just more slowly than had been anticipated.&lt;ref name=New_Scientist&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20735-canadian-cod-make-a-comeback.html#.Uq7QzOXQRvE|title=Cod make a comeback|last=Coghlan|first=Andy|date=2011-07-28|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = KT | last2 = Petrie | first2 = B | last3 = Fisher | first3 = JA | last4 = Leggett | first4 = WC | year = 2011 | title = Transient dynamics of an altered large marine ecosystem | url = http://www.environmentportal.in/files/file/marine%20ecosystem.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 477 | issue = 7362| pages = 86–89 | doi = 10.1038/nature10285 | pmid=21796120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement==

The ''Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement'' (CETA) between Canada and the European Union is a [[Free Trade Agreement]] which is still under negotiation as of May 2015.&lt;ref name=gm15&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/newfoundland-and-labrador-says-talks-at-stalemate-with-ottawa-over-fish-fund/article24616519/ G+M: "Newfoundland and Labrador says talks at stalemate with Ottawa over fish fund"], 26 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The provincial government has argued that the Federal government of Canada in Ottawa reneged on a deal to pay $280 million in exchange for its relinquishment of minimum processing requirements as part of CETA.  Those rules helped protect jobs in fish plants, especially in rural areas hit hard by the [[Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|cod moratorium since 1992]].&lt;ref name=gm15/&gt;

In 2016, Dimash became the first [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] member of [[Mensa International]], after scoring in the upper 99th percentile ([[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford-Binet intelligence scales]]) on an official supervised IQ test, recording an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of over 150. This lead to widespread news coverage of the topic in Kazakhstan and a subsequent increase in Dimash's online following.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other big increases in his following are attributed to various TV appearances, magazine photoshoots, media coverage, and organic follower growth.

Dimash's social media influence led to him cooperating with such brands as [[Audemars Piguet]] and [[Lamborghini]], among others. As a fashion [[Influencer marketing|influencer]], and a model, he often travels to [[Fashion week|Fashion Week]] events around the world, as well as other high-profile events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/style/99643/spotted-the-best-dressed-boys-at-lfw/|title=Spotted: The best dressed boys at London Fashion Week|date=2018-02-19|work=Gay Times|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5270829/Rich-Kids-Instagram-beat-Blue-Monday.html|title=Rich Kids of Instagram show how they beat Blue Monday|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal Life ==

He is currently not married. Because of Dimash's young age, fame, and wealth, the media often refer to him as "Kazakhstan's Most [[Eligible bachelor|Eligible Bachelor]]" and "The Real-Life [[Christian Grey]]".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nur.kz/1093967-shikarnaya-zhizn-samogo-zhelannogo-zheni.html|title=Шикарная жизнь самого желанного жениха Казахстана|last=|first=|date=|work=NUR.KZ|access-date=2018-11-26|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zakon.kz/4844275-samyjj-zavidnyjj-zhenikh-kazakhstana.html#|title=Самый завидный жених Казахстана раскритиковал День Святого Валентина|website=Zakon.kz|language=ru|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been cited by many sources to be [[Physical attractiveness|physically attractive]], and is said to receive a lot of female attention on his social media profiles.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  When asked how important it is for a man to be good-looking, during an interview for the [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan Magazine]], Dimash stated: "Looks are subjective and looks are by far not what's most important for a man. A man should be intelligent, educated, honest, confident, dependable, and generous. Looks only come after all of these."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Dimash is cited to consider family and healthy relationships to be central to a man's happiness. He also strongly dislikes the idea of [[infidelity]]. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Douglas Henderson''' (16 July 1935 – 15 September 2006) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[politician]]. He was [[Scottish National Party|Depute Leader of the Scottish National Party]] (SNP) from 1971 to 1973 and from 1979 to 1981. He served as a [[Scottish National Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[East Aberdeenshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Aberdeenshire]] from 1974 to 1979, and held virtually every national office in the SNP, short of party leader.  His political style has been described as "no-nonsense"&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5353864.stm | title=Former deputy leader of SNP dies |work=[[BBC News]] |date=17 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "very blunt and forthright".&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/douglas-henderson-416599.html |title=Obituaries: Douglas Henderson. SNP MP and deputy leader |first=Tam |last=Dalyell |authorlink=Tam Dalyell |work=[[The Independent]] |date=19 September 2006 |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known for his forceful public speaking, which former SNP leader [[Alex Salmond]] described as "messianic".&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12422437.Douglas_Henderson/ |title=Douglas Henderson |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |date=18 September 2006 |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Henderson was born in [[Edinburgh]], the son of a [[Porter (railroad)|railway porter]].&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2085416.ece |title=Douglas Henderson |work=[[The Times]] |date=19 September 2006 |accessdate=18 June 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won a [[scholarship]] to attend the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh|Royal High School]] and was then awarded a [[bursary]] which allowed him to attend the [[University of Edinburgh]] from 1952 to 1957. He graduated from Edinburgh with an [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]] and an [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]].&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;

He worked as a [[management consultant]] in the UK and overseas.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; He married Maureen Ferguson in [[Johannesburg]] in 1960 and had four children, but they were later divorced.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; In later life, his home and business partner was English fashion designer Betty Davies; together, they founded [[Scottish Fashion International]].&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;

In later years, he regularly attended [[St Giles Cathedral]], where his funeral was held on 7 October 2006.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;

==Political career==

=== Early career (1970–1983)===
Henderson became a supporter of [[Scottish independence]] at an early age, and joined the SNP aged 14.&lt;ref name="scotsman obituary"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/douglas-henderson-1-1141217 |title=Douglas Henderson |work=The Scotsman |date=19 September 2006 |accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was President of the Edinburgh University Nationalist Club.&lt;ref name="Herald 18Sep2006"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12421981.SNP_pays_tribute_as_veteran_nationalist_Douglas_Henderson_dies_at_71/ |title=SNP pays tribute as veteran nationalist Douglas Henderson dies at 71 |work=The Herald |date=18 September 2006 |accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson became heavily involved with the SNP after he returned to Scotland from South Africa in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/sep/26/guardianobituaries.obituaries1 |title=Obituary:Douglas Henderson. SNP chief whip happy to bring down Labour at any price |first=Brian |last=Wilson |authorlink=Brian Wilson (Labour politician) |work=[[The Guardian]] |date= 26 September 2006 |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the director of programmes for [[Radio Free Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland |title =Douglas Henderson | url =http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst3201.html  | accessdate = 24 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1963 to 1965, and was Senior vice-chairman (depute leader) of the SNP from 1970 to 1972,.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; He was selected as the SNP candidate for [[East Aberdeenshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Aberdeenshire]] in 1972, and moved to live in the constituency, developing links with local fishermen, farmers and businessmen.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; He was elected at the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]], and re-elected in the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October general election]] later that year.  The SNP were in the ascendent, campaigning on the basis of "[[North sea oil|It's Scotland's oil]]".&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

Henderson served as the [[whip (politics)|whip]] and was a leading member of the group of 11 SNP MPs in the House of Commons.  In 1975, he negotiated a position for the SNP's [[Winnie Ewing]] in the British delegation to the [[European Parliament]],&lt;ref name="times"/&gt; where she became known as "Madame Ecosse".  He was later the SNP spokesman on employment and industry.  He was instrumental in the SNP's decision to lay down a censure motion in the House of Commons, criticising the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[James Callaghan]] after 1 March 1979 referendum vote on [[Scottish devolution]] failed to be approved by the required 40% of the electorate.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; At the time, the Labour government were reliant upon support from the SNP.  The motion was carried by one vote on 28 March and Callaghan immediately called the general election which brought the Conservative Party led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] to power.  Callaghan described the actions of the SNP as "[[turkeys voting for Christmas]]".&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Henderson lost his seat to Conservative [[Albert McQuarrie]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]] by less than 600 votes, and only two MPs from the SNP remained in the new Parliament.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

He returned to his business career, but with less success than the 1960s.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; At the SNP Conference in 1979, he was elected the party's Senior vice-chairman (now described as deputy leader) (to leader [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]]), defeating [[Margo MacDonald]] for the post.  He remained in this position until 1981, when he stood down on health grounds.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

He fought the new seat of [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]], which had largely replaced Aberdeenshire East in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], again losing to Albert McQuarrie by less than 1,000 votes. Future SNP leader [[Alex Salmond]] would represent this constituency from 1987, and it has since become a somewhat safe SNP seat with four-figure majorities over the [[Conservative and Unionist Party]].  He also suffered in his private life, being divorced in the early 1980s.

===Later revival (1998–2006)===
He was out of active politics for a long period as a result of misdiagnosed illness.  He had a major operation in 1998 for cancer, and then several months of [[chemotherapy]], before he was able to resume his political duties for the SNP.&lt;ref name="scotsman obituary"/&gt;

He contested the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (United Kingdom)|2004 European Parliament election]] for the SNP but was not elected as he was placed fourth on the party's list and they gained only two seats. He also contested the [[Dumfries and Galloway (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumfries and Galloway]] seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], finishing third behind [[Russell Brown (Scottish politician)|Russell Brown]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate and [[Peter Duncan (British politician)|Peter Duncan]] the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/html/684.stm |title=Election 2005. Result: Dumfries and Galloway |work=[[BBC News]] |date=6 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, following the retirement of [[Winnie Ewing]], he stood for the post of SNP President, polling 129 votes (30.00%) {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} compared to 235 votes (54.65%) for [[Ian Hudghton]], [[Member of the European Parliament]], and 66 votes (15.35%) for onetime president [[William Wolfe]]. He was however successful in being elected as one of six ordinary members of the SNP's National Executive Committee.

He was selected to fight the [[Falkirk East (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Falkirk East]] constituency for the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007]], and was ranked fourth on the SNP's [[Central Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Central Scotland]] regional list. He died after a short illness in 2006, before the election could take place.&lt;ref name="snp"&gt;[http://www.snp.org/news/snp_press_release.2006-09-16.6195726594 SNP pay tribute to Douglas Henderson]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, SNP press release, 16 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones is the half-brother of Alexandria "Lexi" Jones (born 2000), the daughter of his father and his father's second wife, Iman. He is also the half-brother of Stacia Larranna Celeste Lipka (born 1980) from his mother's relationship with musician Andrew Lipka, better known as Drew Blood. He has a stepsister, Zulekha Haywood (born 1978), who is the daughter of Iman and former [[NBA]] basketball player [[Spencer Haywood]], Iman's second husband. By 1995, Jones graduated with a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the [[College of Wooster]]. He then pursued a Ph.D degree at [[Vanderbilt University]] in Tennessee, but left before completion to attend [[London Film School]], where he then graduated as a director in 2001.&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/19/observer-profile-duncan-jones-moon "Duncan Jones: Creating his own space odyssey".].

==Career==
[[File:Duncan Jones and David Bowie at the premiere of Moon.jpg|thumb|Jones with his father [[David Bowie]] at the premiere of ''[[Moon (film)|Moon]]'' in 2009]]
Jones was one of many cameramen at his father's widely televised 50th birthday party directed by Englishman [[Tim Pope]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1997 and also at two BowieNet concerts at [[Roseland Ballroom]] in New York City in June 2000. He was also the in-game cinematics director for the political simulator ''[[Republic: The Revolution]]'', as well as scripting elements of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams |first=Sam |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/duncan-jones,54252/ |title=Duncan Jones &amp;#124; Interview |publisher=[[The A.V.

Jones directed the 2006 campaign for the [[French Connection (clothing)|French Connection]] fashion label. The concept of 'Fashion vs Style' was to re-invigorate the brand and move it away from the former incarnation of FCUK, which style pundits believed had become tired and overused.&lt;ref name=fcukoff&gt;{{cite news | last = Akbar | first = Arifa | title = FCUK, off: fashion label decides to rest 'tired' logo | work = The Independent, UK | date = 16 August 2004 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/fcuk-off--fashion-label-decides-to-rest-tired-logo-556767.html| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=byebeattie&gt;{{cite news | last = Sweney | first = Mark | title = French Connection and Beattie part company | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 6 July 2006 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/06/advertising| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advert debuted in the week ending 20 February 2006 and featured two women (representing fashion and style) fighting and briefly kissing each other. The advertisement generated 127 complaints to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]].&lt;ref name=byebeattie /&gt;

Jones's first feature film, ''[[Moon (film)|Moon]]'', was nominated for seven [[British Independent Film Awards 2009|British Independent Film Awards]] in 2009, and won two, Best British Independent Film, and the Douglas Hickox Award for Best British Director on their debut feature.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt; It was also nominated for two [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] at the 2010 ceremony, winning Jones the [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer]]. The film has received 19 other nominations from film festivals and societies, including the BAFTA [[Carl Foreman]] Award.

He directed the [[Summit Entertainment]] project ''[[Source Code]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34456/will-jake-gyllenhaal-crack-duncan-jones-source-code|title=Will Jake Gyllenhaal Crack Duncan Jones' ''Source Code''?|publisher=[[DreadCentral]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a science-fiction thriller from Vendome Pictures, which was produced by [[Mark Gordon]]. ''Source Code'' was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 26{{nbsp}}July 2011 in the United States.

Jones directed and co-wrote [[Warcraft (film)|''Warcraft'']], based on the [[Warcraft|video game series of the same name]], which was released in the summer of 2016.&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite web|author=Borys Kit |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/warcraft-movie-lands-source-code-416956 |title='Warcraft' Movie Lands 'Source Code' Director (Exclusive) |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2016-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones next film would return to the science fiction genre and be called ''[[Mute (2017 film)|Mute]]'', starring [[Alexander Skarsgård]] and [[Paul Rudd]].

'''Ernest Gaston Joseph Solvay''' ({{IPA-fr|sɔlvɛ|lang}}; 16 April 1838 &amp;ndash; 26 May 1922) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[chemist]], [[industrialist]] and [[philanthropist]].

Born at [[Rebecq]], he was prevented by acute [[pleurisy]] from going to university. He worked in his uncle's chemical factory from the age of 21.

In 1861, he developed the [[ammonia-soda process]] for the manufacturing of [[soda ash]] (anhydrous [[sodium carbonate]]) from brine (as a source of [[sodium chloride]]) and [[limestone]] (as a source of [[calcium carbonate]]). The process was an improvement over the earlier [[Leblanc process]].

He founded the company [[Solvay (company)|Solvay &amp; Cie]] and established his first factory at [[Charleroi|Couillet]] (now merged into [[Charleroi]], [[Belgium]]) in 1863 and further perfected the process until 1872, when he patented it. Soon, [[Solvay process]] plants were established in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and Austria. Today, about 70 Solvay process plants are still operational worldwide.

The exploitation of his [[patent]]s brought Solvay considerable wealth, which he used for [[philanthropic]] purposes, including the establishment in 1894 of the "Institut des Sciences Sociales" (ISS) or Institute for Sociology at the [[Free University of Brussels]] (now split into the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]), as well as [[Solvay Conference|International Institutes for Physics and Chemistry]]. In 1903, he founded the [[Solvay Business School]] which is also part of the [[Free University of Brussels]]. In 1911, he began a series of important conferences in physics, known as the [[Solvay Conference]]s, whose participants included luminaries such as [[Max Planck]], [[Ernest Rutherford]], [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie]], [[Henri Poincaré]], and (then only 32 years old) [[Albert Einstein]]. A later conference would include [[Niels Bohr]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Max Born]], and [[Erwin Schrödinger]].

He was twice elected to the [[Belgian Senate]] for the [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party]] and granted honorary title of [[Minister of State (Belgium)|Minister of State]] at the end of his life. [[Solvay, New York]] and [[Rosignano Solvay]], the locations of the first Solvay process plants in the United States and in Italy, are also named after him.

Solvay died at [[Ixelles]] at the age of 84 and is interred there in the [[Ixelles Cemetery]].

{{More footnotes|date=August 2009}} 
The '''essential facilities doctrine''' (sometimes also referred to as the '''essential facility doctrine''') is a [[legal doctrine]] which describes a particular type of claim of [[monopolization]] made under [[competition law]]s.  In general, it refers to a type of [[anti-competitive behavior]] in which a firm with [[market power]] uses a "[[Bottleneck (logistics)|bottleneck]]" in a market to deny competitors entry into the market.  It is closely related to a claim for [[refusal to deal]].

The doctrine has its origins in [[United States law]], but it has been adopted (often with some modification) into the legal systems of [[Law of the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], [[Law of Australia|Australia]], [[Law of South Africa|South Africa]], and the [[Law of the European Union|European Union]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Overview==
Under the essential facilities doctrine, a [[monopoly|monopolist]] found to own "a facility essential to other competitors" is required to provide reasonable use of that facility, unless some aspect of it precludes shared access.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott B. Lipsky, Jr. &amp; J. Gregory Sidak, [https://www.criterioneconomics.com/docs/essential_facilities1.pdf ''Essential Facilities''], 51 {{smallcaps|Stan. L. Rev.}} 1187, 1190–91 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The basic elements of a [[Claim (legal)|legal claim]] under this doctrine under [[United States antitrust law]], which a [[plaintiff]] is required to show to establish liability, are:

#control of the essential facility by a monopolist
#a competitor’s inability to practically or reasonably duplicate the essential facility
#the denial of the use of the facility to a competitor; and
#the feasibility of providing the facility to competitors

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Verizon Communications v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP|Verizon v. Trinko]]'', 540 U.S. 398 (2004), in effect added a fifth element:  absence of regulatory oversight from an agency (the [[Federal Communications Commission]], in that case) with power to compel access.

These elements are difficult for potential plaintiffs to establish for several reasons.  It is quite difficult for a plaintiff to demonstrate that a particular facility is "essential" to entry into and/or competition within the [[relevant market]].  The plaintiff must demonstrate that the "facility" must be something so indispensable to entry or competition that it would be impossible for smaller firms to compete with the market leader.  Likewise, the plaintiff must show that compelling the [[Dominance (economics)|dominant firm]] to permit others to use the facility would not interfere with the ability of the dominant firm to serve its own customers.

==Development==
The first notable case to address the anti-competitive implications of an essential facility was the Supreme Court's judgment in ''[[United States v. Terminal Railroad Association]]'', 224 U.S. 383 (1912).&lt;ref&gt;Abbott B. Lipsky, Jr. &amp; J. Gregory Sidak, [https://www.criterioneconomics.com/docs/essential_facilities1.pdf ''Essential Facilities''], 51 Stan. L. Rev.]] 1187, 1189–91 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  A group of railroads controlling all railway bridges and switching yards into and out of [[St. Louis]] prevented competing railway companies from offering transportation to and through that destination. The court held it to be an illegal restraint of trade.&lt;ref&gt;224 U.S. 383 (1912), at 409-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar decisions include,
* ''[[Associated Press v. United States]]'', 326 U.S. 1 (1945), in which the Supreme Court found that the [[Associated Press]] bylaws which limited membership and therefore access to copyrighted news services violated the Sherman Act.
* In ''[[Lorain Journal Co. v. United States]]'', 342 U.S. 143, 146-49 (1951), ''[[The Lorain Journal]]'' was the only local business doing news and advertisements in town. The case was that refusing to place an ad for the customers of a small radio station was a Sherman Act violation. In the end, the court accepted an offer to simply accept the advertisements.
* ''[[Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States]]'', 410 U.S. 366, 377-79 (1973), in which the Supreme Court found that [[Otter Tail Corporation|Otter Tail]], an electrical utility which sold electricity at both directly to consumers and to municipalities who resold to consumers, violated the Sherman Act by refusing to supply electricity at wholesale, instead serving customers directly itself.
* ''[[Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp.]]'', 427 U.S. 585 (1985), upholding the  ''Lorain Journal'' decision in holding that Aspen Skiing violated § 2 of the [[Sherman Act]] by refusing to honor vouchers and [[ski lift]] tickets after it had previously done so.
* ''[[Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States#Hecht case|Hecht v. Pro Football]]'' where potential American Football League franchise did not show they needed Washington's [[RFK Stadium]], the essential facilities doctrine was not met.

==Application of the doctrine==
There is controversy about what exactly constitutes an "essential facility".  While the doctrine has most frequently been applied to [[Natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] such as [[Public utility|utilities]] and owners of transportation facilities, it has also been applied{{Specify|date=May 2012}} in situations involving [[intellectual property]].  For example, it is possible for a court to apply the doctrine in a case where one competitor refuses to sell materials protected by [[copyright]] or [[patent]] to potential competitors.

==Career==
Krishna, who had previously apprenticed under [[Rajiv Menon]] as an assistant director, was signed on by [[Susi Ganesan]] to appear in a leading role in ''[[Five Star (film)|Five Star]]'', produced by [[Mani Ratnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chennaionline.com/location/5star.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021119014118/http://www.chennaionline.com/location/5star.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 November 2002|title=Five Star|publisher=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chennaionline.com/interviews/krishnakumar.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030225112924/http://www.chennaionline.com/interviews/krishnakumar.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 February 2003|title=5 Star-Krishna Kumar|publisher=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portraying a runaway husband, he won rave reviews with The Hindu's critic noting "there are scenes where he could have underplayed his emotions a little&amp;nbsp;— but surely the young man has talent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2002/10/11/stories/2002101101170200.htm|title=The Hindu : Five Star|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning good reviews for his performance in ''Five Star'', Krishna followed it up playing supporting roles in films including [[Cheran (director)|Cheran]]'s ''[[Autograph (2004 film)|Autograph]]'' and as a student leader in [[Mani Ratnam]]'s ''[[Aaytha Ezhuthu]]'', while also appearing as Dhanush's brother in the romantic comedy, ''[[Thiruda Thirudi]]''. He has since then notably appeared in projects directed by [[Vishnuvardhan (director)|Vishnuvardhan]], featuring in four consecutive ventures. He has balanced appearances in films alongside his advertisement agency.

In 2008, it was reported that he was set to direct a gangster film titled ''Madras'' starring Vishnuvardhan's brother [[Kreshna]] in the lead role, though the project did not materialise after a spat with the producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/just-arrived/article471135.ece|title=Just arrived|author=sudhish kamath|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-04-04/news-interviews/28042245_1_alibaba-krishna-comedy|title=Krishna's acting hues|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/42959.html|title=Krishna to direct Krishna|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krishna has directed a commercial advertisement featuring [[Kamal Haasan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/kamal-to-act-in-a-commercial-advertisement-to-raise-funds-for-treatment-of-aids-patients-tamil-news-142702.html|title=Kamal to do it for the first time to help AIDS patients|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''free license''' or '''open license'''&lt;ref name="opendefinition"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensource.org/docs/osd ''The Open Source Definition'']&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[license agreement]] which contains conditions permitted to the user from the holder on a specific list of uses for his work, which gives him [[Four Freedoms (Free software)|four major freedoms]].

Without a special license, these uses are normally prohibited by the laws of [[copyright]].

Most free licenses are worldwide, [[royalty-free]], [[Non-exclusive license|non-exclusive]], and perpetual (see [[List of copyright durations|copyright durations]]).

Free licenses are often the basis of [[crowdsourcing]] and [[crowdfunding]] projects.

The invention of the term "free license" and the focus on the [[rights of users]] were connected to the sharing traditions of the [[hacker culture]] of the 1970s public domain software ecosystem, the social and political [[free software movement]] (since 1980) and the [[Open source movement]] (since the 1990s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twobits.net/pub/Kelty-TwoBits.pdf |title=The Cultural Significance of free Software - Two Bits |first=Christpher M. |last=Kelty |publisher=[[Duke University]] press - durham and london |year=2008 |pages=99 |quote=''Prior to 1998, Free Software referred either to the Free Software Foundation (and the watchful, micromanaging eye of Stallman) or to one of thousands of different commercial, avocational, or university-research projects, processes, licenses, and ideologies that had a variety of names: sourceware, freeware, shareware, open software, public domain software, and so on. The term Open Source, by contrast, sought to encompass them all in one movement.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights were codified by different groups and organizations for different domains in [[Free Software Definition]], [[Open Source Definition]], [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]], [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]] and the [[The Open Definition|Open definition]].&lt;ref name="opendefinition"&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/ Open Definition 2.1] on opendefinition.org ''"This essential meaning matches that of “open” with respect to software as in the Open Source Definition and is synonymous with “free” or “libre” as in the Free Software Definition and Definition of Free Cultural Works."''&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions were then transformed into licenses, using the [[copyright]] as legal mechanism. Since then, ideas of free/open licenses spread into different spheres of society.

[[Open source movement|Open source]], [[free culture movement|free culture]] (unified as [[Free and open-source software|Free and open-source movement]]), [[anticopyright]], [[Wikimedia Foundation]] projects, [[Public Domain]] advocacy groups and [[pirate parties]] are connected with free and open licenses.

[[File:Sir George Gough Arbuthnot.jpg|right|thumb|Sir George Arbuthnot]]
'''Sir George Gough Arbuthnot''' (28 August 1848 &amp;ndash; 3 May 1929) was a businessman and civic leader in [[British India]].

Arbuthnot, the son of Archibald Francis Arbuthnot (son of [[Sir William Arbuthnot, 1st Baronet]]) and Gertrude Sophia Gough was six times a member of the [[Madras Legislative Council]]. He was seven times made chairman of the Madras [[Chamber of Commerce]], several times President of the board of directors of the [[Bank of Madras]], and in 1900 became chairman of the Famine Relief Fund. Grandson of a [[Baronet]], he was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] on 10 December 1901 for services to the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marlborough House, December 10, 1901.|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/27389/pages/8979|accessdate=14 May 2011|newspaper=The London Gazette|date=20 December 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stock|first=Elliot|title=The Genealogical magazine|year=1904|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIJPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=December+10+1901+%22George+Gough+Arbuthnot%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bHyvbXE-bf&amp;sig=6E_FJeRVGDGqO8VuSOy1dVhRyHM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_HLOTa_5CtSz0QH4g7D1DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=December%2010%201901%20%22George%20Gough%20Arbuthnot%22&amp;f=false|volume=7|accessdate=14 May 2011|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became partner of [[Arbuthnot &amp; Co]] of Madras 1871 and was senior [[partnership|partner]] in the firm at the time of its spectacular crash in 1906, as a result of which he was sentenced to 18 months rigorous imprisonment. The charges against him were (1)  Cheating in respect  of  a  fixed  deposit  in  the  name  of  the Rajah  Krishna  Badahur;  (2)  breach  of  trust  respecting  the  Madras  Equitable  Assurance  Society;  and  (3)  breach  of  trust  in  misappropriating  the  funds  of  Arbuthnot's  Industrials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5095478]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 1873, Arbuthnot married Isabella Albinia Boyle, daughter of Richard Cavendish Boyle, the son of the [[Edmund Boyle, 8th Earl of Cork|8th Earl of Cork]]. They had two daughters.

'''Kurt Ove ''Håkan'' Buskhe''' (born 8 November 1963 in [[Örnsköldsvik]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] businessman, better known as the president and CEO of the Swedish aerospace and defence company [[Saab Group]], a role he has been in since September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4 krav avgjorde Saabs val av vd |url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/4-krav-avgjorde-saabs-val-av-vd_4621635.svd|website=SvD.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Han blir ny Saabchef|url=http://www.privataaffarer.se/borsguiden/han-blir-ny-saabchef-1-104481|website=PivataAffärer.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Håkan Buskhe|url=http://www.di.se/amnen/buskhe-hakan/|website=di.se|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923214253/http://www.di.se/amnen/buskhe-hakan/|archivedate=2015-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this role, he is also the chairman of the board of directors of Sweden’s [[state-owned]]  logistics and transport company [[Green Cargo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hollander, Mats|title=Håkan Buskhe ny ordförande i Green Cargos styrelse |url=http://www.greencargo.com/sv/Pressrum/Nyheter/Nyhetsarkiv/Hakan-Buskhe-ny-ordforande-i-Green-Cargos-styrelse/ |website=Green Cargo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Buskhe was born in 1963 in the north-east of Sweden, in Örnsköldsvik. He attended [[Chalmers University of Technology]], where he earned a [[Master of Science]] degree in science and engineering, as well as a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in engineering, and a [[diploma]] in corporate management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Håkan Buskhe |url= http://www.europeanceo.com/profiles/hakan-buskhe-saab/ |website=EuropeanCEO.com|date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He began his career in the military, carrying out military service during the 1980s, where he worked as a weapons technician. This gave him a basic initiation into the world of arms and defence, the only such experience he would later take into his role at Saab. His first real career move was at a logistics company called Scansped where he joined in 1988 as assistant to the [[managing director]].

'''Jalan Jenderal Sudirman''' or ''' Jalan Sudirman''' ('''Sudirman Road''') is a major thoroughfare in [[Jakarta]] in [[Indonesia]]. The road runs from [[Patung Pemuda Membangun]] at the south end to the bridge of the [[Jakarta Flood Canal|West Flood Canal]] at the north. The road had been built between 1949 and 1953 to connect Central Jakarta with [[Kebayoran Baru]].{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=37}} The historically-prominent road is located in one of Jakarta's central business district area, marking the western side of [[Golden Triangle of Jakarta|Jakarta Golden Triangle]] and the eastern side of [[Jakarta Platinum Triangle]].

==Description==
Sudirman is one of Jakarta's most prominent main roads because of its location in the city's central business district. Sudirman Road was constructed in the late 1940s and was the foundation of the modern image of Jakarta. The road was named after a [[National Hero of Indonesia|National Hero]] [[Sudirman]], whose statue was erected near the north end of the road in September 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ariesaksono.wordpress.com/2008/05/28/patung-jenderal-sudirman-jakarta/ |title=Patung Jenderal Sudirman-Jakarta |author=Arue Saksono |date=May 28, 2008 |website=Arie Saksono - Saya Orang Indonesia |publisher=Wordpress |access-date=November 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109112030/https://ariesaksono.wordpress.com/2008/05/28/patung-jenderal-sudirman-jakarta/ |archive-date=November  9, 2016 |dead-url=no |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire length of Sudirman Road marks the boundary of [[Central Jakarta]] (north of the road) and [[South Jakarta]] (south of the road).

Sudirman Road suffers from Jakarta's heavy traffic congestion. In June 2016, an [[Road space rationing|odd-even traffic scheme]] was implemented on Sudirman, replacing the [[High-occupancy vehicle lane|"Three-in-One"]] scheme which was introduced on December 23, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merdeka.com/jakarta/sejarah-pemberlakuan-3-in-1-di-jakarta.html |title=Sejarah Pemberlakuan 3-in-1 di Jakarta |author= |date=March 29, 2016 |website=Merdeka.com |publisher=KLN Kapanlagi Network |access-date=November 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109112934/https://www.merdeka.com/jakarta/sejarah-pemberlakuan-3-in-1-di-jakarta.html |archive-date=November  9, 2016 |dead-url=no |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement was deemed necessary in order to eliminate the informal profession of [[car jockey]]s, which caused more problems than solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/04/end-of-the-road-jakartas-passengers-for-hire-targeted-by-carpooling-crackdown |title=End of the road: Jakarta's 'passengers for hire' targeted by carpooling crackdown |author= |date=November 9, 2016 |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=November 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109113400/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/04/end-of-the-road-jakartas-passengers-for-hire-targeted-by-carpooling-crackdown |archive-date=November  9, 2016 |dead-url=no |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The odd-even license plate scheme is ti serve as a transitional regulation before an [[electronic road pricing]] system is implemented in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/07/25/ahok-expects-20-percent-fall-in-traffic-from-odd-even-policy.html |title=Ahok expects 20 percent fall in traffic from odd-even policy |author=Callistasia Anggun Wijaya |date=July 25, 2016 |website=The Jakarta Post |publisher=PT.

==History==

===Before Sudirman Road===
Sudirman Road and [[Jalan M.H. Thamrin|Thamrin Road]] were built between 1949 and 1953 with the purpose to connect the suburb [[Kebayoran Baru|Kebayoran]] with [[Central Jakarta]].{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=37}} The plan of Sudirman Road has been laid out at least since the colonial period in the 1930s as part of Batavia's street network expansion plan to the south of the [[Jakarta Flood Canal|west Flood Canal]]. The street planning that would become Sudirman Road is probably the only street planning south of the canal from the colonial period that was actually implemented after Indonesia's independence. The area where Sudirman Road would be laid were mainly kampung settlements, with rice plantation along the west bank of [[Krukut River]] and patches of coconut and fruit tree plantations.{{sfn|Herdruk Topografische Dienst Nederland|Koninklijk Instituut voor de Tropen|1930s}}

===1950s-1960s rural Sudirman Road===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het aanleggen van de hoofdverkeersweg van Djakarta naar Kebajoran TMnr 60054772.jpg|thumb|left|Construction of the Sudirman road in 1950, then known simply as "road connection between Jakarta and Kebayoran".]]
With the development of the [[Kebayoran Baru|Kebayoran]] suburb to the south of Jakarta, there was a need to construct a road connecting the new suburb with the city center. Construction of the road started immediately in 1949 and was largely completed in 1953. This nameless road was dubbed ''Kebayoran Road'' or simply ''weg naar Kebayoran Baru'' (Dutch "the road to Kebayoran Baru"){{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=90}} The new road is rural in quality, lacking planned development on both side of the road. With the nationalization of road names in late 1950s, the road received a name Djalan Raja Djendral Sudirman (General Sudirman Main Road) after a [[Sudirman|National Hero]]. Some high-profile events were held in Sudirman Road e.g. the ''Pekan Raya'' or international trade and entertainment fairs, held between 1953-1955 on the site where [[Atma Jaya University]] now stands. The ''Pekan Raya'' event was the precursor of the [[Jakarta Fair]]s that was held at Medan Merdeka Selatan from 1968 to 1991, before it was relocated to an area of the converted [[Kemayoran Airport]] in 1992, where they are still held today.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=39}}

Developments along Sudirman Road was relatively slow compared with the fast development of [[Jalan M.H. Thamrin|Thamrin Road]]. In the 1960s, the only apparent development along Sudirman Road were the residential neighborhood of Benhil and Setiabudi, which was mostly planned for government workers. These residential neighborhoods was designed with access to Sudirman Road. Other than these residential neighborhoods, Sudirman Road was devoid of any commercial developments.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=27}} In 1963, the sports event [[GANEFO]] was held using the Sudirman Road as the main access to the new [[Gelora Bung Karno|stadium]].

===1970s-1980s construction boom===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het centrum van Jakarta in de avonduren met kantoren en hotels TMnr 20018501.jpg|thumb|right|Sudirman Road in 1992.]]
Only during the 1970s that the Sudirman Road began to experience signs of development along the road, which first appeared north of [[Semanggi cloverleaf interchange|Semanggi]]. Among the first office buildings to be built at Sudirman Road were Wisma Arthaloka (1976), Toyota Astra, Wisma Harapan, Wisma Benhil, [[Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia|Atma Jaya University]], Wisma Metropolitan I, Hotel Sahid Jaya, [[Balai Sarbini|Balai Sarbini, and Gedung Veteran]] (Graha Purna Yudha, 1973). There was also a GKBI ''batik'' cooperatives building on the northwest corner of Semanggi; which would be replaced by Wisma GKBI office tower.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=27}}

The late 1970s saw the construction of Gedung Panin, S. Widjoyo Center, and [[Ratu Plaza]] shopping complex.&lt;ref name="secuil2"/&gt;

The 1980s saw construction boom in Sudirman Road, among them were Prince Centre (Gedung Pangeran), Chase Plaza, Wisma Indocement, Wisma BCA, Summitmas Tower, Mid Plaza, Sentral Plaza, and Wisma Bumiputera.&lt;ref name="secuil2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://truelia.wordpress.com/2011/02/18/secuil-sejarah-pembangunan-jakarta-2/ |title=Secuil Sejarah Pembangunan Jakarta 2 |author=Amalia S. |date=February 18, 2011 |website=truelia.wordpress.com |publisher=Wordpress |dead-url=no |access-date=August 29, 2016 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829113759/https://truelia.wordpress.com/2011/02/18/secuil-sejarah-pembangunan-jakarta-2/ |archive-date=August 29, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present===
[[File:Sudirman Road 01.jpg|thumb|Sudirman Road in 2017]]
On December 23, 2003, a "3-in-1" scheme was introduced for Sudirman Road by Governor [[Sutiyoso]] to deal with the worsening traffic. In February 2004, the Corridor 1 of [[TransJakarta]] Bus Rapid Transit was commercially opened. The new line transformed one lane of the Sudirman Road into a dedicated bus lane unaffected by traffic.

[[Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit]] project which commenced in the end of 2013 would transform Sudirman Road following a transit-oriented scheme. MRT entrances will be constructed at the widened sidewalk, which was done by transforming the slow lane into wider sidewalk. To reduce the congestion, an [[electronic road pricing]] system will be introduced in 2017 to Sudirman Road.

'''Capt. John Ames''' (April 7, 1738 – June 17, 1805) was a [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriot]], Captain in the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[gunsmith]], shovel maker, and ancestor of the [[Ames family]] of Easton, Massachusetts.

== Biography ==
Capt. John Ames was born April 7, 1738, second son of Thomas and Keziah Howard.&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt; He married Susanna Howard in 1759&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt; or 1757.&lt;ref name="RMOF" /&gt; Their children were: David, Keziah and Susanna, Huldah, Abigail, Cynthia, John, and [[Oliver Ames Sr.|Oliver Ames, Sr.]]&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

=== Blacksmith ===
Ames was a blacksmith in Bridgewater, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="RMOF" /&gt; After the "nail and splitting mills" were outlawed by the government in Great Britain to give iron manufacturers in Britain a monopoly in 1773, Ames switched to making shovels.&lt;ref name="RMOF" /&gt; Despite having only a crude factory, he was able to make shovels of notable quality.&lt;ref name="RMOF" /&gt; In fact, he was said to have developed a shovel "so perfect that further improvement seems impossible."&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;
The remains of his trip hammer stone and man-made weirs and dams can be seen at [[War Memorial Park (West Bridgewater, Massachusetts)]].

=== Revolutionary War ===
John Ames made guns for the Massachusetts army during the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RMOF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DAR2" /&gt;

During the war, Ames served in the Massachusetts Militia. In December 1776, the Militia was sent to [[Newport, RI]] to try and prevent British troops from securing a stronghold. John served 15 days alongside two of Washington's generals (one being [[Benedict Arnold]]). In June 1778, they returned to Newport to assist a French fleet in attacks against the British but were sent home after 24 days when the Continental Army under [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]] did not arrive. The last documented service was in July, 1780, when Admiral de Ternay ([[Charles-Henri-Louis d'Arsac de Ternay]]) landed 6,000 French troops in Rhode Island and the Militia was sent to protect them from the British.&lt;ref name="Ames" /&gt; He served as captain in Colonel Edward Mitchell's Regiment in 1776; as captain in Colonel Wade's Regiment, 1778; captain in Major Eliphalet Carey's Regiment, 1780; and Second Major of the 3d Regiment, 1780.  Despite being promoted to major, he was known as "captain" for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="DAR" /&gt;

Captain John Ames died July 17, 1803 in [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

==Ames family and legacy==
The Ames family eventually became a very influential and wealthy family in Massachusetts, establishing two factories as well as having influence in the American railroad expansion and government.

Capt. John's son David Ames (born 1760)&lt;ref name="RMOF" /&gt; was appointed by [[George Washington]] to be the first head of the [[Springfield Armory]].&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt;

Two factories were started by descendants of Capt. John Ames, in different regions of Massachusetts. Ames' son [[Oliver Ames, Sr.]] went on to found the [[Ames Shovel Shop]] in [[Easton, Massachusetts]]. Ames' descendants (grandchildren?), brothers James Tyler Ames and Nathan Peabody Ames, went on to found the [[Ames Manufacturing Company]] in [[Chicopee, Massachusetts]] in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stearns-Ames collection, [ca. 1838-1894]|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/stearnsames-collection-9691|website=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=26 February 2016|quote=The Ames Manufacturing Company, Chicopee, Massachusetts, was founded in 1835 by James Tyler Ames and his brother, Nathan Peabody Ames}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His great-grandson [[Oliver Ames (governor)|Oliver Ames]] became governor of Massachusetts, 1887–1890.

'''John Michael Kohler II''' (November 3, 1844 – November 5, 1900) was member of the [[Kohler family of Wisconsin]] and was a prosperous industrialist and mayor of [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]]. Kohler founded what later became known as the [[Kohler Company]], a large producer of bathroom and kitchen products.

==Early life==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
Kohler was born on November 3, 1844 in the Alpine village of [[Schnepfau]], [[Austria]], the fourth child of dairy farmer John Michael Kohler Sr. (1805–74) and his wife, the former Maria Anna Moosbrugger (1816–53). After his wife's death, the elder Kohler remarried, and he and his large family emigrated to the United States.  With help from a relative, the Kohlers built up a promising dairy business.

After a limited formal education, John Michael Kohler found work in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. In 1865 he moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]] and became a traveling salesman. In [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]], 56 miles north of [[Milwaukee]] on Lake Michigan, he met Lillie Vollrath (1848–1883), the daughter of local steel and iron industrialist [[Jacob Vollrath]] (1824–1898). The couple was married in 1871.

==Business career==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
Shortly after his marriage, Kohler worked at the steel and iron factory his father-in-law partly owned. He took over the company two years later during the [[Panic of 1873]]. By the early 1880s, the firm was producing a variety of iron and enamelware products. In 1883, Kohler put ornamental feet on a cast-iron water trough and sold it as a bathtub. Four years later, more than two-thirds of the company's business was in plumbing products and enamelware. In 1888, Kohler and two partners had the firm incorporated.

In 1899, Kohler purchased 21 acres of farmland four miles west of Sheboygan, intending to move his entire company to the location. Shortly after the new factory was constructed, in 1900, Kohler died at 56, likely of heart failure.

Five years later, 30-year-old Walter J. Kohler assumed his father's corporate presidency and began to guide the firm. In 1912, it was officially designated the Kohler Company, and the property surrounding the plant became the Village of [[Kohler, Wisconsin|Kohler]].

==Civic leadership==
From 1880 until his death Kohler served in several governmental offices. In 1892 he became Mayor.  Citizens also admired Kohler for his generous contributions and leadership in the areas of art and culture, symbols of Sheboygan's desire to be more than a factory town.&lt;ref name="Reeves"&gt;Thomas C. Reeves, Distinguished Service: The Life of Wisconsin Governor Walter J. Kohler, Jr. (Marquette University Press, 2006), pp. 19-29&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[John Michael Kohler Arts Center]], which occupies a square block in downtown Sheboygan (containing Kohler's [[John Michael Kohler House|restored Gilded Age home]] along with modern buildings), is named for Kohler,&lt;ref name="Blodgett"&gt;Richard E. Blodgett, A Sense of Higher Design: The Kohlers of Kohler (Greenwich Publishing Group, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohler Experience"&gt;http://www.akohlerexperience.com/village/tours/art_center&lt;/ref&gt; as is John Michael Kohler State Park, established on land donated in 1966 by the Kohler family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/kohlerandrae/history.html#Kohler |title=John Michael Kohler State Park |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
The Kohlers had six children, including [[Walter Jodok Kohler, Sr.]] (1875-40), who would later be Governor of Wisconsin. In 1887, four years after his wife Lillie's death, John  married Lillie's sister, Wilhelmina (Minnie) Vollrath (1852–1929), and they had one child, [[Herbert Vollrath Kohler Sr]] (1891–1968). This Kohler was to become the dominant force in the Kohler company for many years, presiding over the longest strike in American history.

The large and fashionable Kohler family home in Sheboygan was filled with music, books, and constant lessons in ethics and public service. The entire Sheboygan area mourned Kohler's 1900 death.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} John's three daughters remained in the Kohler house, unmarried, for the rest of their lives, frequently wearing black.

==Biography==
Murphy was born at Loughmark, near [[Cahersiveen]], [[County Kerry]]. He left school at 15 but found work hard to come by. He travelled to London and started up as a subcontractor in the building trade. The [[Second World War]] offered him a golden opportunity. New airfields were urgently needed and later on runway repairs were needed also.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit"&gt;{{cite news|title=John Murphy|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/finance-obituaries/5507923/John-Murphy.html|work=The Telegraph|date=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was successful in providing this service and at end of the war was well placed to help with large-scale reconstruction. Other ventures included [[electrification]], cable installation, water facilities and road-building.

At his death in 2009, his worth was estimated at about £190 million.&lt;ref name="GuardianObit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harrison|first1=Gerry|title=John Murphy &amp;#124; Obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/23/obituary-john-murphy|work=The Guardian|date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He valued his privacy and was known to spend little on luxuries, instead preferring to spend time with his own workmen and other Irish friends.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

==J Murphy &amp; Sons==
In the 1970s a specialist division of the company worked on the development of [[natural gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murphy Group celebrates 60 great years in business|url=http://irishpost.co.uk/murphy-group-celebrates-60-great-years-in-business/|work=Irish Post|date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later projects included the [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted Airport]] Rail Link, work in the [[City of London]], the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]] and [[London Olympic Park|London’s Olympic Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.murphygroup.co.uk/about-us/our-history/|website=Murphy Group|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 J Murphy and Sons generated nearly £500 million of revenue and made pre-tax profits of £60 million. It was appointed lead contractor in the £125 million [[Liverpool]]-[[Manchester]] water pipeline project, which is to carry up to 100 million litres of water per day.&lt;ref name="TelegraphObit" /&gt;

After Murphy's death in May 2009, leadership of the company passed initially to his daughter Caroline, who had been appointed deputy chairperson of the group in 2007.&lt;ref name="Clifford"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clifford|first1=Michael|title=Caroline Murphy and the Murphy Group - one woman's construction empire|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/caroline-murphy-and-the-murphy-group--one-womans-construction-empire-264319.html|accessdate=9 February 2018|work=Irish Examiner|date=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later planned to turn the business into a worker’s Co-op owned by its 3,500 employees, but other board members — notably her mother, brother and half-brother — resisted, and she resigned in 2014.&lt;ref name="Clifford" /&gt;

The company was then led by Steve Hollingshead until the appointment in 2017 of John Murphy's grandson, John B Murphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Founder’s grandson to lead J Murphy &amp; Sons|url=http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2017/10/03/founders-grandson-to-lead-j-murphy-son/|work=Construction Enquirer|date=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year to 31 December 2017 the company made a pre-tax profit of £12.43m from a turnover of £711m, and had 3,878 employees. In 2018, it experienced a slow down in growth, and cancelled its Christmas Party as part of a cost-cutting drive affecting jobs across the business.&lt;ref name="Prior-12Oct2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Prior |first1=Grant |title=Murphy cancels Christmas party as job cuts loom |url=http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2018/10/12/murphy-cancels-christmas-party-as-job-cuts-loom/ |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=Construction Enquirer |date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Property law}}

A '''lien''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|n}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|ən}}){{refn|The pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|n}} is more common in both UK and US English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/lien|title=lien - definition of lien in English - Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=lien|title=The American Heritage Dictionary entry: lien|first=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing|last=Company|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} is a form of [[security interest]] granted over an item of [[property]] to secure the payment of a [[debt]] or performance of some other obligation. The owner of the property, who grants the lien, is referred to as the ''lienee''&lt;ref&gt;"Lienee...One whose property is subject to a lien". Black's Law Dictionary, p. 832 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and the person who has the benefit of the lien is referred to as the ''lienor''&lt;ref&gt;"Lienor... The person having or owning a lien; one who has a right of lien upon property of another". Black's Law Dictionary, p. 832 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; or ''lien holder''.

The [[etymological]] root is Anglo-French ''lien'', ''loyen'' "bond", "restraint", from Latin ''ligamen'', from ''ligare'' "to bind".

In the [[United States]], the term lien generally refers to a wide range of [[encumbrance]]s and would include other forms of [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] or charge.  In the US, a lien characteristically refers to ''[[Nonpossessory interest in land|nonpossessory]]'' security interests (see generally: [[Security interest#Security|Security interest—categories]]).

In other [[common-law]] countries, the term lien refers to a very specific type of security interest, being a passive right to retain (but not sell) property until the debt or other obligation is discharged.  In contrast to the usage of the term in the US, in other countries it refers to a purely ''possessory'' form of security interest; indeed, when possession of the property is lost, the lien is released.&lt;ref&gt;''Hatton v Car Maintenance' [1915] 1 Ch 621&lt;/ref&gt;  However, common-law countries also recognize a slightly anomalous form of security interest called an "equitable lien" which arises in certain rare instances.

Despite their differences in terminology and application, there are a number of similarities between liens in the US and elsewhere in the common-law world.

==United States==
Liens can be consensual or non-consensual (also termed voluntary or involuntary in different states). Consensual liens are imposed by a contract between the [[creditor]] and the debtor:

*[[mortgage law|mortgage]]
*[[chattel mortgage]]

Nonconsensual liens typically arise by [[statute]] or by the [[operation of law|operation]] of the [[common law]]. Those laws give a creditor the right to impose a lien on an item of [[real property]] or a [[Personal property|chattel]] by the existence of the relationship of creditor and debtor.  Those liens include

*[[Tax lien]]s, imposed to secure payment of a [[tax]];
*"Weed liens" and "Demolition liens", assessed by the government to rectify a property from being a nuisance and public hazard;
*[[Homeowner Association]] (HOA) liens for unpaid assessments, fines, late charges, interest, costs, and attorney fees;
*[[Lawyer|Attorney]]'s liens, against funds and documents to secure payment of fees;
*[[Mechanic's lien]]s, which secure payment for work done on property or [[real property|land]];
*[[Judgment (law)|Judgment]] liens, imposed to secure payment of a judgment; and
*[[Sea|Maritime]] liens, imposed on [[ship]]s by [[admiralty law]].

Liens are also "perfected" or "unperfected" (see [[perfection (law)|perfection]]). Perfected liens are those liens for which a creditor has established a priority right in the encumbered property with respect to third party creditors. Perfection is generally accomplished by taking steps required by law to give third party creditors notice of the lien. The fact that an item of property is in the hands of the creditor usually constitutes perfection. Where the property remains in the hands of the debtor, some further step must be taken, like recording a notice of the security interest with the appropriate office.

Perfecting a lien is an important part of the task of protecting the secured creditor's interest in the property.  A perfected lien is valid against bona fide purchasers of property, and even against a [[trustee]] in [[bankruptcy]]; an unperfected lien may not be.

===Equitable lien (U.S.)===
In the United States, references to an "equitable lien" is a right, enforceable only in [[Equity (law)|equity]], to have a demand satisfied out of a particular fund or specific property without having possession of the fund or property. An equitable lien is actually a [[legal remedy]], rather than a security interest created in contemplation of or in support of a transaction. In U.S. law, such liens characteristically arise in four circumstances:&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'' (8th ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;
# when an occupant of land, believing in good faith to be the owner of the land, makes improvements, repairs or other expenditure that permanently increases the land's value;
# when one of two or more joint owners makes expenditures of the kind described above;
# when a [[Life estate|tenant for life]] completes permanent and beneficial improvements to the estate begun earlier by the [[testator]]; and
# when land or other property is transferred subject to the payment of debts, legacies, portions or [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuities]] to third persons.

===Mover's lien===
[[moving company|Movers]] are typically entitled to a '''mover's lien''' under [[Uniform Commercial Code|UCC]] § 7-307/308, to withhold a customer's [[Personal property|goods]] to secure payment.  This is a '''possessory lien''', and is the non-consensual type of lien (because it exists automatically under a statute instead of being affirmatively agreed upon).  However, the concept of a mover's lien is often abused in a [[moving scam]] known as a '''hostage load''', whereby the moving company will [[fraud]]ulently [[extortion|extort]] money not owed by the customer by refusing to deliver the goods unless the customer pays money inflated beyond the [[contract]]ual [[sales quote|estimate]].  Because the customer has an interest in obtaining their own goods, they are under duress to pay the ransom.  Hostage loads in at least the interstate context are illegal under [[Title 49 of the United States Code|49 U.S.C.]] 13905.  The [[Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration|FMCSA]] regulates the moving industry and sometimes takes enforcement action by fining and/or delicensure of offending moving companies.  Moving companies that deliberately engage in hostage-loading may also be considered to be engaging in [[racketeering]] in violation of the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]].

Disputes between legitimate lienholding of chattels vs. hostage-loading can sometimes be averted by the customer including an advanced (before-the-fact) consensual waiver of the mover's right to a lien in the written contract, obligating the moving company to deliver the goods with '''reasonable dispatch''' regardless of disputes over payment, and failure to do so would constitute [[conversion (law)|conversion]] or [[trespass to chattels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/157884/Transport%20Law%20Regulations/Holding%20Freight%20Hostage%20The%20Legal%20Wild%20West%20of%20the%20Transportation%20Industry|title=Holding Freight Hostage: The Legal Wild West Of The Transportation Industry - Transport - United States|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/rulemaking/2012-25678|title=Regulations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/7/part_3|title=PART 3.

==Other common-law countries==
Outside of the US, a common-law lien may be defined in general terms as a passive right to retain a chattel (and, in certain cases, documentary intangibles and papers) conferred by law.  Modern law has generally left the legal lien to cases where it has been historically established without any real effort being made to make it applicable to modern conditions.  In ''Tappenden v Artus'' [1964] 2 QB 185 Diplock LJ referred to a lien as a "self help" remedy, like "other primitive remedies such as abatement of nuisance, self-defence or ejection of trespassers to land".  Equitable liens are an unusual species of property right, usually considered ''[[sui generis]]''.

===Common-law lien===
Common-law liens are divided into ''special liens'' and ''general liens''.  A special lien, the more common kind, requires a close connection between the property and the service rendered.  A special lien can only be exercised in respect of fees relating to the instant transaction; the lienor cannot use the property held as security for past debts as well.  A general lien affects all of the property of the lienee in the possession of the lienor, and stands as security for all of the debts of the lienee to the lienor.  A special lien can be extended to a general lien by contract, and this is commonly done in the case of carriers.&lt;ref&gt;''George Baker Ltd v Eynon'' [1974] 1 WLR 462&lt;/ref&gt;  A common-law lien only gives a passive right to retain; there is no power of sale which arises at common law,&lt;ref&gt;''Thames Iron Works v Patent Derrick'' (1860) 1 J&amp;H 93&lt;/ref&gt; although some statutes have also conferred an additional power of sale,&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see for example, Innkeepers Act 1878&lt;/ref&gt; and it is possible to confer a separate power of sale by contract.

The common-law liens are closely aligned to the so-called "common callings", but are not co-extensive with them.

A common-law lien is a very limited type of security interest.  Apart from the fact that it only amounts to a passive right to retain, a lien cannot be transferred;&lt;ref&gt;''Legg v Evans'' (1840) 6 M&amp;W 36&lt;/ref&gt; it cannot be asserted by a third party to whom possession of the goods is given to perform the same services that the original party should have performed;&lt;ref&gt;''Pennington v Reliance Motors Ltd'' [1923] 1 KB 127&lt;/ref&gt; and if the chattel is surrendered to the lienor, the lien entitlement is lost forever&lt;ref&gt;''Hatton v Car Maintenance'' [1915] 1 Ch 621&lt;/ref&gt; (except for where the parties agree that the lien shall survive a temporary re-possession by the lienor).  A lienee who sells the chattel unlawfully may be liable in conversion as well as surrendering the lien.&lt;ref&gt;''Mulliner v Florence (1878) 3 QBD 484&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equitable lien===
In common-law countries, equitable liens give rise to unique and difficult issues.  An equitable lien is a nonpossessory security right conferred by operation of law, which is similar in effect to an [[equitable charge]].  It differs from a charge in that it is non-consensual.  It is conferred only in very limited circumstances, the most common (and least ambiguous) of which is in relation to the sale of land; an unpaid vendor has an equitable lien over the land for the purchase price, notwithstanding that the purchaser has gone into occupation of the property.  It is seen as a counterweight to the equitable rule which confers a beneficial interest in the land on the purchaser once contracts are exchanged for purchase.

It is a matter of conjecture how far equitable liens extend outside of the unpaid vendor's lien.  Equitable liens have been held to exist in a number of cases involving [[chose in action|choses in action]], but not yet in relation to chattels.&lt;ref&gt;''Transport and General Credit v Morgan'' [1939] 2 All ER 17&lt;/ref&gt;  The Australian courts have been the most receptive towards equitable liens in relation to personal property (see ''Hewett v Court'' (1983) 57 ALJR 211, but a review of the cases still leaves a lack of clarity in relation to the principles upon which an equitable lien will be imposed.
* In ''Re Stucley'' [1906] 1 Ch 67 a vendor of a reversionary interest in a trust fund, who sold the interest to the trustee, was held to have an equitable lien in the subject matter, although it was clearly personalty and not realty.
* In ''Barker v Cox'' (1876) 4 Ch D 464 the purchaser of property which was included in a matrimonial settlement paid the price in advance to one of the trustees, and the purchaser was held to have an equitable lien in investments which the trustees subsequently acquired with the purchase price.
* In ''Langen and Wing v Bell'' [1972] Ch 685 a [[board of directors|director's]] service agreement required him to assign his shares in the [[company (law)|company]] if he was terminated, and he was to receive a price calculated at a later date when the annual accounts were available; he was held to have an equitable lien over the transferred shares to secure the payment of the eventual purchase price.
* In ''Lord Napier &amp; Etterick v Hunter'' [1993] 2 WLR 42 it was held that an indemnity insurer's [[subrogation]] rights in relation to funds improperly paid directly to the insured were subject to an equitable lien.
But overall, there is still perceived to be a lack of central nexus.&lt;ref&gt;See Phillips J, "Equitable Liens—A search for a unifying principle" in Palmer &amp; McKendrick, ''Interests in Goods'' (2nd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statutory liens and contractual liens===
Although arguably not liens as such, two other forms of encumbrance are sometimes referred to as liens.

====Statutory liens====
Certain statutes provide for a passive right to retain property against its owner as security for obligations.  For example, section 88 of the [[Civil Aviation Act 1982]] of the United Kingdom permits an airport to detain aircraft for unpaid airport charges and aviation fuel.  Although this right has been treated as a lien under UK insolvency law,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Bristol Airport v Powdrill'' [1990] Ch 744&lt;/ref&gt; it has been argued that such statutory rights are not in fact liens, but rights analogous to liens,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Michael Bridge, ''Personal Property Law'' (2nd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; although some might say that this is a distinction without a difference{{who|date=April 2014}}.

====Contractual liens====
It has also been argued that an agreement by contract that one party may retain the goods of another party until paid is not a lien,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; as under the common law, liens could only be non-consensual.  However, it appears that under insolvency law, such rights will be treated as liens even if they are not expressed to be liens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Maritime liens==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Admiralty law]] --&gt;
{{main|Maritime lien}}
A '''maritime lien''' is a lien on a vessel, given to secure the claim of a creditor who provided maritime services to the vessel or who suffered an injury from the vessel's use.  Maritime liens are sometimes referred to as ''tacit hypothecation''.  Maritime liens have little in common with other liens under the laws of most jurisdictions.

The maritime lien has been described as "one of the most striking peculiarities of [[Admiralty law]]".&lt;ref name="Griffith Price 1940"&gt;Griffith Price, ''The Law of Maritime Liens'' (1940)&lt;/ref&gt;  A maritime lien constitutes a security interest upon ships of a nature otherwise unknown to the common law or equity.  It arises purely by [[operation of law]] and exists as a claim upon the property concerned, both secret and invisible, often given priority by statute over other forms of registered security interest.&lt;ref&gt;''Bankers Trust v Todd Shipyards, The Halcyon Isle'' [1981] AC 221&lt;/ref&gt;  Although characteristics vary under the laws of different countries, it can be described as:
# a privileged claim,
# upon maritime property,
# for service to it or damage done by it,
# accruing from the moment that the claim attaches,
# travelling with the property unconditionally,
# enforced by an action ''[[in rem]]''.&lt;ref name="Griffith Price 1940"/&gt;

'''Market Driven Quality''' (MDQ) is a term currently espoused by Donna Prestwood and Paul Schumann, but which has been around since the early 1980s.  IBM used MDQ as their slogan for the [[IBM PCjr]] and [[OS/2]].  MDQ is defined as letting the market, meaning the price, determine the quality standards a business applies to its products.  The term has gone out of favor somewhat, due to Wal-Mart's approach to MDQ.  Wal-Mart doesn't use the term "MDQ" but applies the principle rigidly to its vendors.

Certainly MDQ has its place.  We would not have commodity pricing on PCs if not for MDQ.  And, on the other hand, if a business is seeking an upscale market then MDQ provides justification for high prices for high quality.  Certainly [[Alienware]] thrives whereas the PC Jr died.

'''Mishaal bin Abdulaziz al Saud''' ({{Lang-ar|مشعل بن عبد العزيز آل سعود}} ''Misha`al bin `Abd al-`Azīz as-Saʻūd''; 5 September 1926 &amp;ndash; 3 May 2017) was chairman of the [[Allegiance Council]] and a senior member of the [[House of Saud]]. He held different cabinet posts in the 1950s.

==Early life==
Prince Misha'al was born on 5 September 1926.&lt;ref name="arabnews"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/1094266/saudi-arabia |title=Prince Mishal bin Abdulaziz passes away at 90 |last=Al-Sulami |first=Mohammad |access-date=4 May 2017 |work=Arab News |publication-date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saudi Arabian royal succession"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Allegiance+Council.-a0272373988 |title=Saudi Arabian royal succession |date=14 November 2011 |publisher=APS Diplomat News Service |language=English |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411223309/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Allegiance+Council.-a0272373988 |archive-date=11 April 2013 |dead-url=no |access-date=16 March 2013 |quote=Prince Mish'al, born in 1926 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the thirteenth son of [[Ibn Saud]].&lt;ref name=nabilm&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mouline|first=Nabil|title=Power and generational transition in Saudi Arabia|journal=Critique Internationale|date=April–June 2012|volume=46|pages=1–22|url=http://www.ceri-sciencespo.com/publica/critique/46/ci46_nm.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Prince Mishaal served as the Minister of Defense from 12 May 1951 to 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Forces History|url=http://rslf.gov.sa/English/aboutus/pages/overview.aspx|work=Royal Saudi Land Forces (RSLF)|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tkap6812&gt;{{cite web|last=Kapoor|first=Talal|title=Nayif's Departure: Spring Cleaning in The Royal Court?|url=http://www.datarabia.com/royals/home.do;jsessionid=70AD079602B157A59264B8CD3893B7C0|work=Datarabia|accessdate=10 June 2012|date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He replaced his full brother Prince Mansour as minister of defense when he died of alcohol poisoning after a party hosted by then-Riyadh governor [[Nasser bin Abdulaziz]] in 1951.&lt;ref name=wikileaks2006&gt;{{cite web|title=The new successıon law preserves the monarchy|url=https://wikileaks.org/cable/2006/11/06RIYADH8921.html#|work=Wikileaks|accessdate=21 April 2012|date=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until that date, Prince Mishaal served as deputy minister of defense. When he became minister, his younger full brother [[Mutaib bin Abdul-Aziz|Prince Mutaib]] was appointed his deputy.&lt;ref name=ssarabia/&gt;&lt;ref name="hertog"/&gt; As minister of defense, he became one of the most affluent princes in the [[Al Saud]] family. He bought state land for very cheap prices and yielded extraordinary profits.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} But because of his lack of education and experience, Prince Mishaal let the ministry remain completely unorganized. He leaned heavily on advice and recommendation from foreign counsel.&lt;ref name="hertog"/&gt; He wielded significant influence in Ibn Saud's government.&lt;ref name="hertog"/&gt; Because of Mishaal's considerable power, Ibn Saud countered his influence by appointing [[Abdallah al Faisal|Abdullah bin Faisal]] as minister of health and interior.&lt;ref name="hertog"/&gt;

At the same time, [[Ibn Saud]] established the ministry of air force under Prince Mishaal to prevent flight-related matters from going under [[Talal bin Abdul Aziz|Prince Talal]], the then minister of communication.&lt;ref name="hertog"/&gt; Since Mishaal and Talal could not agree, Saudi Arabia was to have two airline fleets.&lt;ref name="hertog"/&gt; But in April 1955, Prince Talal resigned and the ministry of communication was merged with ministry of finance.&lt;ref name="hertog"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Hertog|title=Princes Brokers and Bureaucrats|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YNM4vMi7FtcC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=15 January 2013|date=23 February 2011|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-5753-1|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1955, [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Saud]] created a renewed modern [[Saudi National Guard|National Guard]]. This was led by Saud's son Prince Khalid who replaced a commoner.&lt;ref name="hertog"/&gt; This move weakened Prince Mishaal because he had often used the old National Guard's resources.&lt;ref name="hertog"/&gt;

==Other positions==
Mishaal and his full-brother Mutaib were ousted from the office under [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Saud]] but they returned to favour in 1963 under regent and later [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]] who entrusted them a key governorship and deputy governorship, respectively. Specifically, Mishaal served as Governor of [[Makkah Province]]&lt;ref name=nabilm/&gt; from 1963 to 1971. Both Mishaal and Mutaib resigned from their posts in 1971 for reasons that are not entirely clear.&lt;ref name=ssarabia/&gt; Prince Mishaal was appointed chairman of [[Allegiance Council|the Allegiance Council]] on 10 December 2007.&lt;ref name=aarabiya07&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Mishaal to head Allegiance Commission: Saudi launches royal succession committee|url=http://www.26sep.net/nprint.php?lng=english&amp;sid=35735|accessdate=10 November 2012|work=Al Arabiya|date=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Succession to the throne===
Mishaal bin Abdulaziz protested more than once that he should have been crown prince since he served as both a governor and a minister and was older than some of his brothers. Mishaal's firm, Mishaal International, along with its German and Chinese partners, is the leading contender to build much of the Kingdom's new multibillion-dollar railway system.&lt;ref name=wikileaks2006/&gt; On the other hand, it is argued that he was immediately excluded from the competition for the title of crown prince by the [[Sudairi Seven|Sudairi brothers]].&lt;ref name=nabilm/&gt;

===Influence===
Mishaal bin Abdulaziz was impartial in family politics, although he was known to incline towards [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdallah]] or be one of King Abdullah's close allies.&lt;ref name=nabilm/&gt; His neutral stance made him the perfect choice to be the chairman of the Allegiance Council. This role was considered to be a significant position, giving him influence in the decision-making process in regard to succession.&lt;ref name=kapoor10&gt;{{cite web|author=Talal Kapoor|title=Briefing: Prince Mish'al's Health Condition|url=http://www.datarabia.com/royals/viewCommentary.do?id=14513|work=Datarabia|accessdate=11 May 2012|date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business activities==
Mishaal bin Abdulaziz was a leading businessman, with substantial investments in real estate, insurance, electrical utilities, oil trading and cement manufacture.&lt;ref name="gulfbusiness" /&gt;

He was founder of [[Al Shoula Group]], which is a major investor in real estate developments throughout the Middle East partnering with such investors as Dubai's [[Emaar]] Group, Kuwait's Bayt Al Mal Investment Company, and the [[Al Rajhi Bank|Al Rajhi family's]] Tameer Group. Al Shoula's wholly owned subsidiary, Dhahran Global, is active in broad areas of the petroleum and petrochemical industry including pipeline development, oil and gas production, oilfield services and international product trading.&lt;ref name=dhahrangc&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Shoula Group|url=http://dhahran-global.com/v1/main/press/shoulagroup.html|work=Dhahran Global Company|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CEO of Al Shoula Group was his son Prince Abdulaziz.&lt;ref name=dhahrangc/&gt;

Prince Mishaal was also chairman of the board of Yanbu Cement company, established in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.yanbucement.com/history.html|work=Yanbu Cement Company|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life ==
Mishaal bin Abdulaziz was a supporter of the traditional [[camel racing]] and horse racing, and had valuable racing camels and horses. Each year, he patronized camel races in the kingdom. He also dealt with traditional falconry.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Mischal ibn Abd al-Aziz|Mischal ibn Abd al-Aziz]]{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abdul Aziz bin Fahd]] married Al Anoud bint Faisal Al Saud in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Crown Prince of Dubai to attend the wedding of Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd Al Saud|url=http://fazza.ae/en/2010/12/22/the-crown-prince-of-dubai-to-attend-the-wedding-of-prince-abdulaziz-bin-fahd-al-saud/|publisher=Fazza|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the granddaughter of Prince Mishaal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=الأمير عبد العزيز بن فهد يحتفل بزواجه من كريمة الأمير فيصل بن مشعل|url=http://www.alriyadh.com/2010/12/23/article588103.html|accessdate=6 June 2012|newspaper=Al Riyadh|date=23 December  2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, Mishaal bin Abdulaziz was rushed to hospital in [[Geneva]], apparently having suffered a stroke.&lt;ref name=kapoor10/&gt; Then, he returned to Saudi Arabia from unspecified medical treatment in [[Beirut]] in December 2009.&lt;ref name=ssarabia/&gt; Mishaal died on 3 May 2017 at the age of 90 according to the official Saudi Press Agency.&lt;ref name="arabnews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gulfbusiness"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://gulfbusiness.com/saudi-king-salmans-brother-prince-mishaal-dies/ |title=Saudi King Salman’s brother Prince Mishaal dies |access-date=4 May 2017  |work=Gulf Business  |publication-date=4 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://al-marsd.com/126085.html وفاة الأمير مشعل بن عبدالعزيز رحمه الله]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gulfnews"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/king-salman-s-brother-prince-mishaal-dies-aged-93-1.2021736 |title=King Salman's brother Prince Mishaal dies aged 93 |access-date=4 May 2017 |work=GulfNews.com |publication-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nikollë Bojaxhiu''' ({{circa|1874}} – {{circa|1919}}) was an [[Albanian people|Albanian]] businessman, benefactor, politician and the father of the Roman Catholic nun and missionary [[Mother Teresa]]. His company constructed the first theater of [[Skopje|Üsküb]] (now Skopje) and participated in the development of the railway line that connected [[Kosovo]] with Skopje – a project which he personally financed.

An active Albanian rights activist, he was also the only [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] to be elected to the city council of Skopje. Bojaxhiu died in 1919 in obscure circumstances, which led to reports that attributed his death to poisoning by Serbian agents. His children included Lazar, and Agnes Bojaxhiu ([[Mother Teresa]]).

== Life ==
 
Nikollë was born in 1874 in [[Prizren]] to Lazër and Çilja Bojaxhiu. Bojaxhiu moved to Skopje in the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] (present-day [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]) after 1900, where he first worked as a pharmacist and later became a partner in a construction company.&lt;ref name="MaasburgMiller2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maasburg|first1=Leo|last2=Miller|first2=Michael J.|title=Mother Teresa of Calcutta: A Personal Portrait|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4UxVZNER5EC&amp;pg=PA71|accessdate=19 October 2012|date=2011-10-01|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=9781586175559|pages=71–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a polyglot; as well as Albanian he also spoke [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croat]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. In the early 1900s, he married Dranafile Bernai with whom he had three children: Aga (b. 1905), Lazar (b. 1908) and Agnes (b. 1910), with the latter becoming later better known as [[Mother Teresa]]. Nikollë Bojaxhiu's company constructed the city's first theater and part of the railway line that connected Skopje with the region of Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Alpion2006"/&gt; He was also the owner of a wholesale food company and the only Roman Catholic member of the city council of Skopje.&lt;ref name="Alpion2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alpion|first=Gëzim|title=Mother Teresa: Saint or Celebrity?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u_FE30FTbg0C|accessdate=19 October 2012|date=2006-12-26|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415392464|pages=148–51, 157–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence]] (November 28, 1912) he hosted a meeting that was attended by [[Bajram Curri]] and [[Hasan Prishtina]] among others.&lt;ref name="Alpion2006"/&gt; After the region's incorporation into Serbia, Bojaxhiu joined various Albanian rights political organizations. He died in 1919, a few hours after he returned from a political meeting in [[Belgrade]]. Several biographers have attributed his death to poisoning by Serbian agents.&lt;ref name="Alpion2006"/&gt; The location, purpose and participants of the meeting remain unknown. His son Lazar considered the theory of poisoning to be a certainty, while his daughter Agnes described it as unconfirmed.&lt;ref name="Alpion2006"/&gt; 

His funeral process was attended by large numbers of people and representative of all the religious communities. As a sign of respect, that day all school children were given dedicatory handkerchiefs and jewellers' shops remained closed.&lt;ref name="Alpion2006"/&gt; After his death, his partner appropriated the entirety of their companies' assets and left nothing to his widow and offspring.&lt;ref name="MaasburgMiller2011"/&gt;

Nikollë Bojaxhiu was born into a [[Kosovar Albanian]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poplin|first=Mary|title=The Marriage Devotional: 365 Simple Ways to Celebrate Your Love|date=28 January 2011|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0830834723|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vzx3U2_cpogC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=%22Mother+Teresa+Albanian%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mother%20Teresa%20Albanian%22&amp;f=false|quote=Mother Teresa, Albanian Catholic Nun Founder of the missionaries of charity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Group|first=Salisbury|title=The Salisbury Review, Volumes 19–20|date=28 January 2011|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0830834723|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lf6BAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Mother+Teresa+Albanian%22&amp;dq=%22Mother+Teresa+Albanian%22|quote=Mother Teresa, Albanian by birth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kosovo to Honor Mother Teresa|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/kosovo-to-honor-mother-teresa|accessdate=15 November 2014|publisher=Zenit|date=6 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother Teresa Beyond the Image|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/sebba-teresa.html|accessdate=15 November 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alpion|first1=Gëzim|date=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|title=Mother Teresa: Saint or Celebrity? |isbn=0203087518|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rq6S6qCWCbUC&amp;pg=PT266&amp;lpg=PT266&amp;dq=mother+teresa+kosovo+prizren#v=onepage&amp;q=mother%20teresa%20kosovo%20prizren&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 November 2014|quote="the nun's mother was born in Prizren in Kosova, her family came originally from the Gjakova region, also in Kosova"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Albanian scholar [[Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_creation/Aurel_Plasari|Aurel Plasari]] claimed that Nikollë Bojaxhiu could have been of [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] origin, mainly based on a document, found by Macedonian author Stojan Trencevski, which asserted that Mr. Bojaxhiu was, at some point, the representative of the Aromanian community of Skopje.&lt;ref name="Plasari"&gt;{{cite web|last=Plasari|first=Aurel|url=http://www.trepca.net/2003/1003/031013-ap-bojagjite.e.nene.terezes.htm|title=Bojaxhite e Nene Terezes|publisher=Shekulli|date=29 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this hypothesis has been rejected by scholar Albert Ramaj, who, based on the testimony of a contemporary, Lalush Lalevski, argues that the representative of the Aromanian community at the time, whose last name was Boiadjijev, was another person, and entirely unrelated to Nikollë Bojaxhiu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trepca.net/2003/1103/031115-a.ramaj-reagim.ndaj.shk.a.plasarit-bojaxhite.e.nene.terezes.htm Ramaj, Albert in "Stublla 15 November 2003, p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt; Ramaj's position was later endorsed by scholars Ukshini and Xhufi.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | title = , ethnicity and patriotism—the Balkans ‘unholy war’ for the appropriation of Mother Teresa | journal = Journal of Southern Europe and the Balkans | date = December 2004 | first = Gëzim | last = Alpion | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | url = http://www.socscistaff.bham.ac.uk/gezim_alpion/downloads/Media_ethnicity_and_patriotism.pdf | accessdate = 2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mother Teresa had said: “By blood, I am Albanian.

'''PaperWorks''' was a [[computer program]] introduced by [[Xerox Corporation]] in 1992, which allowed a business traveler to [[communicate]] with his or her [[personal computer]] while away from the [[office]].

PaperWorks could be used to send and retrieve documents between the fixed computer system and the business traveler, by using [[fax]] machines.  

The software created special [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]] [[Form (document)|forms]], similar to the type of forms used to score [[standardized tests]].  (Related topic: [[Optical mark recognition|OMR]])

The [[user (computing)|user]] would then [[fax]] the form back to the central computer, commanding one of several tasks to be performed.  For example:
* the user could attach a document to the form which would be stored at the home office (for possible later processing), or 
* the user could request that a particular [[document]], stored on the computer's [[hard drive]], be sent to the user.
* the user could request that a particular [[document]] be distributed to other users, also by fax.

The underlying technology for PaperWorks, called "[[DataGlyphs]]"[http://www.dataglyphs.com], was developed at [[Xerox PARC]].

'''ParAccel, Inc.''' was a [[California]]-based software company. 
It provided a [[database management system]] designed for advanced [[analytics]] for [[business intelligence]]. ParAccel was acquired by [[Actian]] in April 2013.&lt;ref name="Actian"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Actian Picks Up ParAccel to Boost Analytics Portfolio |work= Silicon Angle |date= April 29, 2013 |author= Maria Duetscher |url= http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/04/29/actian-picks-up-paraccel-to-boost-analytics-portfolio/ |accessdate= November 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ParAccel was a venture-backed company focused on developing software for data analysis.
It acquired some [[intellectual property]] from the company XPrime, which ended operations in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Warehouse appliances: boom or bust? |work= The Register |date= December 13, 2005 |author= Philip Howard |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/13/warehouse_appliances/ |accessdate= January 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= ParACCEL up and running: The new boy on the data warehouse appliance block  |work= The Register |date= March 30, 2006 |author= Philip Howard |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/03/30/paraccel_enters_datawarehouse_market/ |accessdate= January 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was officially incorporated in February 2006, founded by Barry Zane who became chief technology officer, and was first funded by [[angel investor]]s.
In August 2006 the first series of [[venture capital]] came from  [[Mohr Davidow Ventures]], Bay Partners and Tao Venture Partners.
In 2007 the company was based in [[San Diego, California]], with an office in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. David J. Ehrlich was chief executive, and Bruce Scott, vice president of engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Company: Accelerating Business Intelligence |work= Old ParAccel web page |url= http://www.paraccel.com/company.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070820103518/http://www.paraccel.com/company.html |archivedate= August 20, 2007 |accessdate= December 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2007, a second round of $20 million included previous investors and was led by Walden Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Notice of Sale of Securities [Regulation D and Section 4(6) of the Securities Act of 1933], item 06 |publisher= US Securities and Exchange Commission |date= November 28, 2007 |url= https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/07/9999999997-07-050041 |format= PDF |accessdate= November 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December the company opened an office in [[Cupertino, California]] (part of [[Silicon Valley]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= ParAccel Secures $20 Million in Venture Financing and Opens Cupertino Office |date= December 10, 2007 |work= Press release |url= http://paraccel.com/pdf/ParAccel_Secures_Financing.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517045326/http://paraccel.com/pdf/ParAccel_Secures_Financing.pdf |archivedate= May 17, 2008 |accessdate= December 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third round of $22 million in June 2009 was led by [[Menlo Ventures]]. In January 2010 Mark Lockareff replaced Ehrlich as interim chief executive.&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{Cite news |title=ParAccel Appoints Charles W.

ParAccel was based in California with offices in [[Campbell, California|Campbell]] and [[San Diego]].
Competitors included [[Greenplum]] (from [[GoPivotal|Pivotal]]), [[EXASOL]], [[Vertica]] (from [[Hewlett-Packard]]), [[Netezza]] (from [[IBM]]), [[Oracle Corporation]], and [[Teradata]] (including its [[Aster Data Systems]] technology).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Comparing Vertica, ParAccel and Exasol |date= August 19, 2008 |work= Information Week |author= Curt Monash |url= http://www.informationweek.com/software/information-management/comparing-vertica-paraccel-and-exasol/d/d-id/1071118 |accessdate= November 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amazon" /&gt;

In contrast Maverick was designed as a stand-alone data store.&lt;ref name="part2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= ParAccel Corporate Brief |work= HP partner web site |date= March 4, 2009 |url= http://h21007.www2.hp.com/portal/download/partner/Corporate%20Brief%20on%20ParAccel%20Data%20Warehousing%20v6_1236198035276.pdf |accessdate= January 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
ParAccel discontinued Amigo in favor of the stand-alone offering which evolved into the ParAccel Analytic Database (PADB).{{When |date= January 2014}}

The ParAccel Analytic Database was a parallel relational database system using a [[shared-nothing architecture]] with a columnar orientation, [[adaptive compression]], memory-centric design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Partial join order optimization in the paraccel analytic database |work= Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of data |pages= 905–908 |authors= Yijou Chen,  Richard L.

ParAccel's DBMS engine is built for analytics, initially based on [[PostgreSQL]].  ParAccel began phasing in a new optimizer (Omne) in release 2.0 and made significant changes to Omne in subsequent releases (3.1 released in June 2011).
ParAccel implements compiled queries, and a proprietary interconnect protocol for inter-node communications. It integrated with [[storage area network]] technologies such as those from [[EMC Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= ParAccel Update |author= Thomas C.

'''PinpointBPS''' is a [[methodology]] for process improvement in laboratories.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miningweekly.com/article/rbcts-new-coal-sampling-lab-designed-to-accommodate-expansion-provides-quality-assurance-2016-07-15/rep_id:3650|title=RBCT’s new coal sampling lab designed to accommodate expansion, provides quality assurance|last=Breytenbach|first=Mia|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is underpinned by eight principles that form the basis for decision-making in a laboratory.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pinpointbps.com/principles|title=Principles|website=PinpointBPS® Movement {{!}} Optimizing laboratory performance using the 8 Principles of Certainty|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; While its application is mainly in healthcare — particularly [[Medical laboratory|medical laboratories]] — it has also been applied in other industries. The methodology has been heralded as "groundbreaking" in the field of laboratory performance improvement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Overview ==
Medical laboratories operate in highly regulated environments that demand consistent quality of patient outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parwani|first=Anil V.|last2=Hassell|first2=Lewis|last3=Glassy|first3=Eric|last4=Pantanowitz|first4=Liron|date=2014-10-21|title=Regulatory barriers surrounding the use of whole slide imaging in the United States of America|journal=Journal of Pathology Informatics|volume=5|doi=10.4103/2153-3539.143325|issn=2229-5089|pmc=4221881|pmid=25379344|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The external environment’s impact on the broader global healthcare industry is also dictating the need for ongoing improvements in quality and delivery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pathology|first=Association of Directors of Anatomic and Surgical|date=2006-09-01|title=Recommendations for Quality Assurance and Improvement in Surgical and Autopsy Pathology|url=http://ajcp.oxfordjournals.org/content/126/3/337|journal=American Journal of Clinical Pathology|language=en|volume=126|issue=3|pages=337–340|doi=10.1309/2TVBY2D8131FAMAX|issn=0002-9173|pmid=16880147}}&lt;/ref&gt; while using fewer resources that leads to cost savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34589128|title=Lord Carter's plans for saving the NHS £5bn a year - BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other regulations, the Carter Report in the [[United Kingdom]] dictates that GBP£200-million in cost savings must be achieved by 2020,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhsemployers.org/news/2016/02/carter-report|title=Carter Report - NHS Employers|website=www.nhsemployers.org|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] in the [[United States]], also known as Obamacare, imposed further taxation requirements on medical laboratories, reducing cost saving ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mlo-online.com/labs-speak-out-against-additional-affordable-care-act-cuts.php|title=Labs speak out against additional Affordable Care Act cuts {{!}} MLO|last=Allen|first=Julie Scott|website=www.mlo-online.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Jonathan Berg stated at [[Royal College of Pathologists|The Royal College of Pathologists]]' annual meeting in 2012 that "We need to be creative and innovative in the services we offer, and we need to get our finances under control",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bivda.co.uk/News/PressReleases/tabid/73/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/710/jobs.aspx|title=Experts meet to explore the Value of Pathology ahead of the National Pathology Year 2012  &gt; BIVDA - The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association &gt; Member Press Releases|website=www.bivda.co.uk|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating the critical need for innovation within pathology and a stronger focus on financial controls and performance. Within this context, PinpointBPS was founded as a methodology focusing on [[innovation]], [[risk management|risk reduction]] and financial impact&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pinpointbps.com/news/2016/3/11/continuous-improvement-in-pathology-laboratories|title=Uncertainty: Is resistance to change inhibiting innovation in laboratories?|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; relating to laboratory performance improvement.

== Methodology ==
The PinpointBPS methodology is centered on the following process of discovery that highlights current performance, expected future performance and the means to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pinpointbps.com/news/2016/3/10/pinpointbps-movement-continuous-improvement|title=Inside the PinpointBPS® Movement: Innovating Towards Certainty in Laboratories|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology has also been aligned with [[ISO 15189]] requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pinpointbps.com/news/2016/4/28/iso15189-guidelines|title=Taking care of ISO 15189 compliance with PinpointBPS®|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The PinpointBPS Methodology ===
The steps below provide a high-level overview of the methodology in practice.

==== 1. Focus on quantified value ====
While all effort within the laboratory is put into value creation, from [[turnaround time]] improvements to quality output and cost savings / profit increases, it is important that the performance of each of these can be quantified and their relationship with the financial performance of the laboratory understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darkdaily.com/creating-added-value-from-clinical-pathology-laboratory-testing-produced-improved-outcomes-at-university-of-mississippi-medical-center-and-broward-health622|title=Creating Added Value from Clinical Pathology Laboratory Testing Produced Improved Outcomes at University of Mississippi Medical Center and Broward Health {{!}} Dark Daily|website=www.darkdaily.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enables the laboratory to understand current performance needs while at the same time establishing the [[Performance indicator|key performance indicators]] that are important and should be measured.

==== 2. Determine current performance ====
Understanding the current performance of the laboratory provides the necessary context to highlight performance improvement requirements as well as areas of excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dana|first=Travnickova|date=2009|title=Processes assessment and monitoring in a clinical laboratory|url=http://qip-journal.eu/files/2009/2009-1/QIP_1-2009_Travnickova.pdf|journal=Quality Innovation Prosperity|volume=8|issue=1|access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should be conducted by looking at sample turnaround time and resource utilization, and should be considered on a holistic basis, creating a virtual model of the whole laboratory by mapping out all processes and activities in detail. This provides an end-to-end perspective on current performance and forms the basis for future performance improvement initiatives.

==== 3. Understand future performance ====
The expectation for future performance should be done through [[business process modeling]], with current performance as the foundation. Using LIS data as well as data from workforce scheduling, and combining this data with the process model of the laboratory, creates an environment where changes to the laboratory can be [[Simulation|simulated]] and the impact to performance understood in quantifiable terms. It is important to validate both the integrity of the [[data]] and the accuracy of the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ezzelle|first=J.|last2=Rodriguez-Chavez|first2=I. R.|last3=Darden|first3=J. M.|last4=Stirewalt|first4=M.|last5=Kunwar|first5=N.|last6=Hitchcock|first6=R.|last7=Walter|first7=T.|last8=D’Souza|first8=M. P.|date=2008-01-07|title=Guidelines on Good Clinical Laboratory Practice|journal=Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis|volume=46|issue=1|pages=18–29|doi=10.1016/j.jpba.2007.10.010|issn=0731-7085|pmc=2213906|pmid=18037599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a desirable outcome for future performance has been found, the difference (or delta) in performance is evaluated to understand future performance requirements.

==== 4. Establish performance delta and requirements ====
The difference in performance between current ([[Baseline (budgeting)|baseline]]) and future (expected) performance highlights the necessary process changes and related initiatives that are required to achieve the future performance. This impact should be measured according to finance ([[cost]] or [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]), quality and turnaround time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkins|first=Robert C|date=2007-11-01|title=Laboratory Turnaround Time|journal=The Clinical Biochemist Reviews|volume=28|issue=4|pages=179–194|issn=0159-8090|pmc=2282400|pmid=18392122}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these changes to take effect, each change initiative is prioritized based on a quantified understanding of its impact to the laboratory 'bottom line', while also improving turnaround time, quality or both.

=== Comparison with Lean ===
While the PinpointBPS methodology can support [[Lean manufacturing|Lean]] (and other [[Continual improvement process|continuous improvement]] methodologies like [[Six Sigma]]) in that it ultimately aims to provide patients and other stakeholders with quality outputs, its approach differs from other methodologies like the [[Lean laboratory|Lean Laboratory]] in various ways:
* While lean focuses on waste and the elimination thereof,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://businesscasestudies.co.uk/nestle/achieving-sustainability-through-lean-production/eliminating-waste.html|title=Eliminating waste - Achieving sustainability through lean production - Nestlé {{!}} Nestlé case studies, videos, social media and information {{!}} Business Case Studies|website=businesscasestudies.co.uk|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; PinpointBPS focuses on understanding process and the impact of changes to processes on value while reducing risk.
* The definition of success differs in its layers of ambiguity. The focus of lean is to achieve "the happy situation of perfect value provided with zero waste",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Improving Health Management through Clinical Decision Support Systems|last=Moon|first=Jane D.|publisher=IGI Global|year=2016|isbn=9781466694323|location=Australia|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; while PinpointBPS aims to establish a quantified definition of future value — "facts and figures, no fluff".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Lean has evolved from the manufacturing approach first designed by [[Toyota]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/History.cfm|title=A Brief History of Lean|website=www.lean.org|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; while PinpointBPS has been specifically developed for use in [[pathology]] performance improvement.
* Lean allows for the focus and treatment of individual or isolated performance issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCulloch|first=Peter|last2=Kreckler|first2=Simon|last3=New|first3=Steve|last4=Sheena|first4=Yezen|last5=Handa|first5=Ashok|last6=Catchpole|first6=Ken|date=2010-01-01|title=Effect of a "Lean" intervention to improve safety processes and outcomes on a surgical emergency unit|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|volume=341|pages=c5469|issn=1756-1833|pmid=21045024|doi=10.1136/bmj.c5469}}&lt;/ref&gt; while PinpointBPS motivates for a system-wide approach first by creating visibility and testing.
* Prioritization in Lean is done according customer priority or on a [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|FIFO]] (first in, first out) basis, while PinpointBPS encourages prioritization according to expected, quantified output linked to cost reduction or profit generation.

== PinpointBPS in Practice ==
PinpointPBS has been based on eight practical principles that allow laboratories to take ownership of the methodology and performance improvement initiatives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The 8 Principles ===

==== 1. Boost the bottom-line, or bust ====
As with any organization, value creation is the ultimate goal, however purely focusing on quality output may neglect cognizance of financial value. Understanding the ultimate financial impact of any value creating activity is critical for ongoing [[sustainability]].

==== 2. Led by a common language ====
Ensuring that everyone in the [[organization]] (and [[value chain]]) has the same understanding of value creation and how it links to financial performance

Continuous innovation requires us to draw from the same knowledge and speak the same language. We establish a [[Universal Truths and Cycles|universal truth]] that enables us to work together seamlessly.

==== 3. Trust the transparency ====
We value a clear line of sight into our strengths, our weaknesses and the connections between every process, person, and piece of technology.

==== 4. Facts and figures, no fluff ====
We believe in making decisions based on evidence. In our quest for bottom-line impact, every business action must be supported by real, tangible proof.

==== 5. Driven by decisiveness ====
We are empowered through understanding our performance and what shapes it. This allows everyone in our organization to make decisions swiftly, with understanding and certainty.

==== 6. Inaccuracy is inexcusable ====
Close is not close enough. Every decision we take is based on fact, and our execution must be accomplished with the same precision

==== 7. Big impact beats small ====
We believe in following the big opportunities that significantly impact the bottom line, rather than wasting time and resources on those that do not.

==== 8. Knowledge knows no bounds ====
We are only as good as the collective we represent. We fundamentally believe in continually imparting [[knowledge]] and learning from each other to move the industry forward.

== Tools ==
Various tools have been developed to enable the methodology in laboratories, including performance overviews, standardized process mapping using [[Business Process Model and Notation|BPMN]] (business process model and notation), as well as simulation and [[Scenario planning|scenario modeling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pinpointbps.com/solutions|title=Solutions|website=PinpointBPS® Movement {{!}} Optimizing laboratory performance using the 8 Principles of Certainty|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional certification ==
PinpointBPS professional [[certification]] can be granted to both laboratories that practice the methodology, as well as people who have successfully completed further study of the methodology. Two levels of PinpointBPS professional certifications exist. These certifications have been [[Accreditation|accredited]] by [http://www.ascls.org/p-a-c-e PACE], [https://cpduk.co.uk/ CPD], and the [https://www.rcpath.org/ Royal College of Pathologists].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ltsconsulting.com/learning|title=LTS Learning - Training courses for diagnostics laboratories|website=LTS Holdings|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Champion ===
A PinpointBPS Champion is a professional who is able to interpret laboratory performance improvement metrics, map out all processes within a laboratory and make improvement recommendations.

=== Master ===
A PinpointBPS Master builds on the PinpointBPS Champion certification and is a professional who is able to simulate changes to a laboratory and interpret performance outputs, to make performance improvement recommendations and manage initiatives from start to end.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13630">'''Preferred metric sizes''' are a set of [[international standard]]s and [[de facto standard]]s that are designed to make using the metric system easier and simpler, especially in engineering and construction practices. One of the methods used to arrive at these preferred sizes is the use of [[Preferred number|preferred numbers]] and [[Convenient number|convenient numbers]] such as the [[Renard series]], the [[1-2-5 series]] to limit the number of different sizes of components needed.

One of the largest benefits of such limits is an ensuing multiplicative or exponential reduction in the number of parts, tools and other items needed to support the installation and maintenance of the items built using these techniques. This occurs because eliminating one diameter fastener will typically allow the elimination of a large number of variations on that diameter (multiple thread pitches, multiple lengths, multiple tip types, multiple head types, multiple drive types, and the tools needed for installing each, including multiple drill bits (one for each different thread pitch, material, and fit combination).

=== Liquor Bottle Sizes ===
International agreements, including 75/106/EEC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.welmec.org/fileadmin/user_files/publications/6-1.pdf|title=Application of Directives 75/106/EEC and 76/211/EEC concerning the marking and quantity control of e-marked prepackages|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; specify 0.1, 0.25 ({{frac|1|4}}), 0.375 ({{frac|3|8}}), 0.5 ({{frac|1|2}}), 0.75 ({{frac|3|4}}), 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 5 litres as the capacities of liquor bottles allowed in international commerce.

In the United States, the alcohol industry switched to metric bottle sizes on October 1, 1976, abandoning the existing 38 sizes of bottles and instead adopting the following sizes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/11/archives/liquor-industry-converts-to-metric-system-liquor-industry-is.html|title=Liquor Industry Converts to Metric System|last=Cherry|first=Rona|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* 50 ml (miniature)
* 200 ml (replaced the half-pint)
* 500 ml (replaced the pint)
* 750 ml (replaced the fifth)
* 1000 ml (replaced the quart)
* 1750 ml (replaced the half-gallon)

== Building Construction ==

* [[#ISO 6708 Nominal Diameter|ISO 6708 Nominal Diameter]] (for garden hose sizes)

=== System 32 Furniture ===
[[System 32 (furniture)|System 32]] is a standard for the design and manufacture of furniture, most commonly used in the design of cabinets, wherein the major parts (sides, doors, etc.) are available in increments of 32&amp;nbsp;mm, and shelf supports consist of columns of 5&amp;nbsp;mm holes on 32&amp;nbsp;mm centers.

=== ISO 2848 Basic Module ===
The [[ISO 2848]] basic module is a unit of 100&amp;nbsp;mm, often represented by a single capital "M", along with 300&amp;nbsp;mm and 600&amp;nbsp;mm groupings, that is widely used for the widths of furniture in Europe.
* A standard metric (concrete) block is 190 mm wide, 390 mm long, and 190 mm high, which allows for 10 mm mortar joints in between bricks, giving a standard unit size of 200 mm square by 400 mm long.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://themetricmaven.com/?p=8268|title=Another Brick in the Wall|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A standard metric brick is 90 by 57 by 190 mm; with 10 mm of mortar, that produces a standard unit of 100 mm x 200 mm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Office Equipment &amp; Supplies ==
=== ISO 216 Paper Sizes ===
[[ISO 216]] standard specifies the A sizes of paper, including the very common A4, wherein the base size of A0 is one square meter, and the ratio between the height and width is {{radic|2}}, which results in all sizes of paper having the same aspect ratio.

Also related is the set of pen thicknesses for technical drawings (0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.50, 0.70, 1.00, 1.40, and 2.00&amp;nbsp;mm).

== Manufacturing ==
=== ISO 261 and 262 Fastener Diameters ===
ISO 261 defines a set of preferred metric machine screw/bolt sizes, and [[ISO 262]] defines a subset of those; both are based roughly on [[Renard series]] as defined in [[ISO 3]], [[ISO 17]], and [[ISO 497]]. Given that even ISO 262 specifies a fairly large set of diameters, a much simplified set of preferred diameters was developed by one of the lead designers of [[ASME Z17.1]] and ANSI B4.2, Knut O. Kverneland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metric Standards for Worldwide Manufacturing|last=Kverneland|first=Knut O.|publisher=Amer Society of Mechanical Engineers|year=1996|isbn=978-0791800416|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce the list to 6 preferred sizes, and another 6 intermediate supplementary sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gometricusa.org/table2.html|title=TABLE 2 - FASTENER SIZES|last=Kverneland|first=Kurt|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each size bolt or screw and type of head, there is a corresponding size driver prescribed by various ISO standards, including:
* Internal hex drive: ISO 2936:2001 "Assembly tools for screws and nuts—Hexagon socket screw keys"
* External hex drive: ISO  4014, 4015, 4015, 4017, and 4018.

=== ISO 1307 Plastic Hose Sizes ===
ISO 1307:2006, Rubber and plastics hoses—Hose sizes, minimum and maximum inside diameters, and tolerances on cut-to-length hoses specifies nominal diameters for four different types of plastic hoses, including "Type C", which includes the typical [[garden hose]]. Each nominal diameter specifies different ID minimum and maximum values. Notice that the nominal size is a Renard Series.

=== ISO 6708 Nominal Diameter ===
{{Anchor|ISO 6708}}
Nominal diameter, abbreviated DN, is the designation system specified by ISO 6708 for specifying the diameter of trade sizes of metric pipework components, and is the metric equivalent to [[Nominal Pipe Size]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/21274.html|title=ISO 6708:1995: Pipework components -- Definition and selection of DN (nominal size)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is among several ISO specifications that formalize [[preferred number]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and is referred to by numerous other international standards, including ISO 7598 and EN 10255. The complete set of DN values allowed by the standard are:

|}
The number following the DN is a [[Real versus nominal value|nominal value]] that is roughly the number of millimeters of a circular feature on the connection point of the pipe, fitting, coupling, etc., but often differing by a noticeable amount. If the DN value is related to the internal bore diameter of the feature, the size should be represented by DN/ID (for Inside Diameter), and if the DN value is related to the outside diameter, the size should be represented by DN/OD (for Outside Diameter).

The relationship between DN and [[Nominal Pipe Size|NPS]] pipe sizes are as follows. Note that the actual internal diameter varies depending on the pipe wall thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wes.ir/files/797832605piptub.pdf|title=Tube Sizes - ISO|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reed &amp; Reed Inc.''' is a private general contractor based in [[Woolwich, Maine]].

==Company history==
Founded in 1928 by Captain [[Josiah W. Reed]] and son [[Carlton Day Reed]], the initial capital was roughly $2,000. By 1930, Reed &amp; Reed was already beginning its first bridge construction projects. These would come to define the company's image for nearly five decades.

Although founded in 1928, Reed &amp; Reed, Inc. was first incorporated in 1982. Since then, operations have continued to grow and expand. In 1992, RR Caribbean Inc. was established in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] to handle the company's Caribbean ambitions. Only two years later, in 1994, the company purchased Callahan Brothers, Inc., a leading competitor in contracting and design.

Perhaps the company's most high-profile project began in 2003 as a joint venture with rival Cianboro Inc. The [[Penobscot Narrows Bridge and Observatory]], which has become a [[Maine]] landmark, began construction following a competitive bid among many contractors. Other high-profile undertakings included one of New England's largest wind farms, located in [[Mars Hill, Maine]], and the new Ocean Gateway pier for cruise ships in [[Portland, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2011/09/15/pier-without-peer-in-maine_2011-09-15/|title=Pier without peer in Maine|date=2011-09-15|work=Press Herald|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
While many of Reed &amp; Reed's projects are located in Maine, job sites are scattered all over [[New England]] and the [[Caribbean]]. Although the bridge contracts continue to provide millions in revenue for the company every year, it has recently begun pursuing wind energy as a major initiative. As part of this, the corporate logo, as seen on their website, has added wind mills.

The three main goals of Reed &amp; Reed are clearly outlined: safety, quality, and performance. Often used by the State of Maine's [[Department of Transportation]] for large- and small-scale projects, Reed &amp; Reed has built a reputation for quality throughout New England.

In 2017 Reed &amp; Reed purchased PLC Construction, an electrical transmission contractor, based out of New Hampshire.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2017/04/17/maine-construction-firm-reed-reed-buys-new-hampshire-subcontractor/|title=Maine construction firm Reed &amp; Reed buys New Hampshire subcontractor|date=2017-04-17|work=Press Herald|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; PLC Construction was often a subcontractor of Reed &amp; Reed and employed approximately 40 workers at the time of purchase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Samir "Sam"  Hammam''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: سمير همام) is a Lebanese businessman, well known for his high-profile involvement in British [[association football|football]] clubs, and presently holding a life presidency at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-23439428.stm "Sam Hammam urges Cardiff FC fans to back Vincent Tan"][[BBC]]Retrieved on 17 August 2013,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wimbledon==
Originally moving to the area due to being a keen [[tennis]] fan, Hammam became involved in football by buying £40,000 worth of shares at [[Non-League football|non-league]] [[Wimbledon F.C.]] in two years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://football.guardian.co.uk/FA_Cup/Story/0,,629335,00.html "The Guardian: Still crazy"]&lt;/ref&gt; eventually taking full control of the club in 1977.&lt;ref name=inside&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/656552.stm|title=Hammam sells Wimbledon stake|date=25 February 2000|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Hammam, Wimbledon achieved four promotions in nine years, becoming a [[Football League First Division]] club in 1986 and winning the [[FA Cup]] in [[1987–88 FA Cup|1988]].

In 1990, before Wimbledon had moved out of their [[Plough Lane]] ground to groundshare at [[Selhurst Park]] with local rivals [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], Hammam bought out a covenant held on the ground by the [[London Borough of Merton|Council]] that required it to be retained for sporting use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisa.org.uk/cgi/l/articles/index.cgi?action=show&amp;id=523 "WISA article on lifting of Plough Lane covenant"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426070543/http://www.wisa.org.uk/cgi/l/articles/index.cgi?action=show&amp;id=523 |date=26 April 2012 }} Retrieved on 23 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, Hammam failed in an attempt to relocate the club to [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/championship/3010879/Inside-Sport-Hammam-cast-in-villains-role-as-Dons-seek-happy-ending.html|title=Inside Sport: Hammam cast in villain's role as Dons seek happy ending|date=16 August 2001|accessdate=5 January 2015|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Hammam sold 80% of his shares in Wimbledon to [[Bjørn Rune Gjelsten]] and [[Kjell Inge Røkke]]. He sold the remaining 20% to Gjelsten and Røkke in February 2000, three months before the club's relegation from the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; In 2004, Wimbledon F.C. was relocated to [[Milton Keynes]] and rebranded as the [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|MK Dons]], with the newly formed [[AFC Wimbledon]] often considered the successor club to the original Wimbledon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/fa_cup/9223993.stm|title=AFC Wimbledon chase FA Cup history against Stevenage |date=25 November 2010|accessdate=5 January 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cardiff City==
Hammam purchased control of Cardiff City F.C. at the end of 2000, where he picked up where he left off with Wimbledon. After taking over at Cardiff, Hammam controversially pledged to get the entire Welsh nation to support Cardiff by renaming the club ''"The Cardiff Celts"'' and changing the club colours to green, red and white.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/wales/846497.stm BBC Wales: Hammam: 'I will die for Cardiff Celts']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/wales/863572.stm BBC Wales: Fans are Hammam's big worry]&lt;/ref&gt;

At Cardiff he became a [[cult following|cult]]-hero with fans for taking part in their head-patting '[[The Ayatollah (football celebration)|do the Ayatollah]]' chant. One such game saw him performing the celebration during an infamous 2–1 home win in the [[FA Cup]] against then-[[Premier League]] side [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 2002. This, along with other aspects of his behaviour during the match, was blamed for contributing to the subsequent violence between Leeds and Cardiff fans at the end of the match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport/Cardiff-supremo-rejects-mayhem-claims.2292427.jp "Cardiff supremo rejects mayham claims"], ''[[The Scotsman]]'' Retrieved on 6 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing to get the new stadium plans agreed by [[Cardiff Council]] due to concerns over financial security in 2006, Hammam agreed to a takeover by a consortium led by new chairman [[Peter Ridsdale]] and including local businessman Paul Guy. In March 2008, Cardiff City began a court case against financial backers Langston over the repayment of a loan believed to be worth around £31 million. During the hearing the barrister representing the club named Sam Hammam as the man they believe to be behind the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7290681.stm "Hammam named in Cardiff loan case"] [[BBC]] Retrieved on 14 March 2008,&lt;/ref&gt; No settlement was reached in the case.

In July 2013, following Cardiff City's promotion to the Premier League, it emerged that Malaysian businessman [[Vincent Tan]], who had taken effective control of the club in 2010, was in advanced talks with Hammam – confirmed as Langston's spokesman – about repayment of the loan, then thought to be around £24 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-23362625.stm "Vincent Tan: Cardiff City could be debt-free in 'days'"] [[BBC]] Retrieved on 17 August 2013,&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, on 18 July 2013, Tan announced that an "amicable resolution" had been reached between Cardiff City and Langston over the debt issue, with Sam Hammam becoming a life president of the club.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23413324.stm "Cardiff City: Tan &amp; Langston reach "amicable resolution""]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[BBC]] Retrieved on 17 August 2013,&lt;/ref&gt; Hammam confirmed this in an interview with the [[BBC]] on 24 July, requesting that fans of the club back the Malaysian owner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-23439428.stm "Sam Hammam urges Cardiff FC fans to back Vincent Tan"][[BBC]] Retrieved on 17 August 2013,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Hammam has achieved a level of notoriety in English football for his unusual antics at matches, frequently walking around the pitchside during games, and his eccentric methods of publicising himself and his players. On at least one occasion he made a player eat sheep's testicles prior to signing with Cardiff City.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/1411563.stm BBC Sport:Prior moves to Cardiff 28 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''superbill''' is an itemized form used by [[healthcare provider]]s for reflecting rendered services. Superbill is the main data source for creation of healthcare claim, which will be submitted to payers (insurances, funds, programs) for reimbursement. Although the superbill form is not unified, and it is created/modified depending on [[healthcare provider]] specialty, type of rendered services, additional requirements, as well as ease of handling, there is a set of obligatory attributes, relevant to all superbill types.

Superbill form consists of four main parts, containing mandatory fields to be completed for accurate claim creation:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2656">{{Nihongo|'''Tokumei kumiai'''|匿名組合}}, literally "anonymous partnerships," are a [[Japan]]ese [[bilateral contract]] governed by the Commercial Code of Japan, Article 535 ''et seq''.&lt;ref name="art535"&gt;[http://ja.wikibooks.org/wiki/%E5%95%86%E6%B3%95%E7%AC%AC535%E6%9D%A1 Japanese Commercial Code, article 535]&lt;/ref&gt; In English, they are often called '''TK''' or '''silent partnerships'''. In many respects they are similar to [[common law]] [[limited partnership]]s.

In a tokumei kumiai arrangement, {{Nihongo|"anonymous (or silent) partners"|匿名組合員|tokumei kumiai'in}} invest in a venture operated by a {{Nihongo|manager|営業者|eigyōsha}}.&lt;ref name="art535" /&gt;

By law, the partnership itself has no [[Juristic person|legal personality]]. Any assets of the partnership are the property of the manager; however, the anonymous partners have a right to a share of any profits from the venture, as provided in the partnership agreement. Anonymous partners have [[limited liability]] for the partnership's debts, on the condition that they are anonymous. If an anonymous partner allows their name to be used in the name of the manager or in the name of the partnership, the anonymous partner loses their limited liability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ja.wikibooks.org/wiki/%E5%95%86%E6%B3%95%E7%AC%AC536%E6%9D%A1 Japanese Commercial Code, article 536]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tokumei kumiai are often used for investment funds. A structure known as the "Dutch TK" was once popular among foreign investors in Japan, as it was possible to recognize income from Japan through a Dutch anonymous partner in a tokumei kumiai without paying Japanese income or withholding taxes under the tax treaty of 1970. This loophole was closed by a new tax treaty in August 2010, which imposes a 20% withholding tax on distributions through such structures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taxand.com/news/newsletters/New_Dutch_Japanese_Tax_Treaty_Signed_Benefits_Investors&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has become popular to use a tokumei kumiai together with a [[godo kaisha]] to hold a [[Land trust|trust]] [[beneficial interest]] in real estate using what is known as a "TK/GK scheme."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amendment To The Japanese Real Estate Joint Enterprise Act: Will It Benefit Overseas Investors?|url=http://mondaq.com/x/254384/real+estate/Amendment+to+the+Japanese+Real+Estate+Joint+Enterprise+Act+Will+It+Benefit+Overseas+Investors|publisher=[[Jones Day]]|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William A. Schmidt''' (May 21, 1902 &amp;ndash; June 19, 1992) was an [[United States|American]] [[welder]] and [[shop foreman]] who served two terms as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[Wisconsin State Senate]] from the [[Wisconsin Senate, District 6|Sixth District]] (the 2nd, 7th, 10th, 20th &amp; 25th [[wards of the United States|Wards]] of the City of [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]).

== Background ==
Schmidt was born in [[Princeton, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/schlacter-schmies.html#964.94.20|title=William A. Schmidt|publisher=Political Graveyard|accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Roman Catholic]]. He received his early education at [[parochial school]] in
[[Montello, Wisconsin]] and the [[Montello High School]]. He attended [[Marquette University]] for one year. He was a [[welder]] who became a maintenance
foreman for [[A. O. Smith]]. Schmidt was active in his [[labor union]], serving as chairman of the [[collective bargaining|bargaining]] and coordinating committees of his [[local union|local]]. He was a member of the [[Knights of Columbus]], [[Fraternal Order of Eagles]], [[Holy Name Society]] of St. Michael's Church, Badger Fisherman's League, and Montello Rod and Gun Club.

==Career==
In the 1948 Democratic [[primary election]] for the Sixth Senate District, Schmidt (a former [[Wisconsin Progressive Party|Wisconsin Progressive]]&lt;ref&gt;"Frank Graass Loses in Bid for Assembly", ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'', September 22, 1948; p. 2, col. 2&lt;/ref&gt;) won the nomination by 22 votes from incumbent [[Edward Reuther]], and went on to win the general election in a four-way race against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Wisconsin State Assembly|Assemblyman]] [[Paul Jaeger]], as well as a [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] and a [[Henry A. Wallace|Wallace]] [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|"People's Progressive"]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1950 Ohm, Howard F.; Kuehn, Hazel L., eds. ''The Wisconsin Blue Book, 1950'' Madison: State of Wisconsin, 1950; p. 28, 655, 673, 757]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1951 session, he served as assistant [[floor leader]] for the Democrats. He was re-elected in 1952; unopposed in his primary, he again defeated Republican Jaeger, whom he had faced in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1954 Toepel, M. G.; Kuehn, Hazel L., eds. ''The Wisconsin Blue Book, 1954'' Madison: State of Wisconsin, 1954; pp. 24, 660, 775]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmidt would remain a member of the Senate through 1956, but did not run for re-election, but instead ran for [[Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin]]; Schmidt and [[List of Governors of Wisconsin|gubernatorial]] [[running mate]] [[William Proxmire]] lost in the general election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1958 Toepel, M. G.; Kuehn, Hazel L., eds. ''The Wisconsin Blue Book, 1958'' Madison: State of Wisconsin, 1958; pp. 663, 778]&lt;/ref&gt; (The man who beat Schmidt for Lieutenant Governor, [[Warren P. Knowles]], would eventually become governor himself). Schmidt was succeeded in the Senate by fellow Democrat [[William R. Moser]].

Part of the [[Thomson Reuters]] Risk Management Solutions suite, the '''World-Check''' [[database]] of [[Politically exposed person|Politically Exposed Persons]] (PEPs) and heightened risk individuals and organisations is used around the world to help to identify and manage financial, regulatory and reputational risk.

The creation of the database was in response to legislation aimed at reducing the incidence of [[financial crimes]]. To begin with, World-Check's intelligence was used by banks and financial institutions as a comprehensive solution for assessing, managing and remediating risk. However, as legislation has become increasingly complex and its reach has become increasingly global, the demand for such intelligence has grown beyond the financial sector to include organisations from all sectors.

== Research coverage ==
World-Check's research team monitors emerging risks in more than 60 languages, covering over 240 countries and territories worldwide. All information used is in the public domain and research analysts profile individuals and entities using open-source research methodology ([[OSINT]]) while adhering to strict protocol such as that laid down by the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] (UK).

In 2011, World-Check received independent assurance under the International Standard on Assurance Engagements ([[ISAE 3000]]) for the internal processes and controls that govern its global sanctions platform and dataset.

A dedicated team of research analysts correlates sanction and embargo lists from around the world, including lists such as OFAC, UK HMT, EU, OSFI, FATF and the Australian DFAT. Regulatory and enforcement lists are monitored as well as lists of debarred and banned parties.

Specific areas of interest, such as terrorism, organised crime and the [[Middle East]], are covered by specialist research teams.

==About World-Check==

Registered in [[London]], World-Check was founded in 2000 by David Leppan to address the risk mitigation requirements of the Swiss banking community. During 2008, World-Check launched Country-Check, an index that ranks over 240 countries and territories worldwide in terms of risk. A statistical algorithm is used to aggregate various information sources across political, financial and criminal factors and this quantifies risk attached to customers and transactions according to their country of origin. Based on statistics and not perception, Country-Check provides practical intelligence for informed decision-making, useful for mergers and acquisitions, security of supply chain, cross border expansion and exploration, and production.

In 2009 World-Check increased its offering by acquiring IntegraScreen, a provider of enhanced due diligence reporting services. IntegraScreen reports are used when a detailed background check on any entity or individual is required, and research can be carried out no matter where the location.

== Leak of Database and Security Compromises ==
In a reddit post, a user declared that he had acquired a copy of the World-Check database with information up to 2014. This leak online apparently was possible due to an incomplete assessment of the security, and was downloaded through the website Shodan, a search engine that lets the user find specific types of computers connected to the internet using a variety of filters, raising questions about the allegedly privacy and security of the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/4q840n/terrorism_blacklist_i_have_a_copy_should_it_be/:|title=Terrorism Blacklist: I have a copy. Should it be shared? • r/privacy|website=reddit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==False claims==
===PSC===
In 2017, World-Check admitted that the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) should never have been placed on their database at all and, specifically, should not have been associated with "terrorism", stressing that there were no grounds to suggest that PSC were either associated with terrorism related activity or that the organisation presented any kind of financial risk. The PSC and World-Check have reached an agreement to address the harm done to the reputation of the PSC and its chair, Mr. Hugh Lanning, and to resolve the matters between them arising from that profile.&lt;ref&gt;http://imemc.org/article/palestine-solidarity-campaign-removed-from-world-check-terrorist-listing/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finsbury Park Mosque===
