==History==

=== Founding ===
[[File:ACkonverents.jpg|thumb|left|200px|AIESEC in [[Estonia]]]]
The idea behind AIESEC started in 1948, when representatives from schools across Europe exchanged information about various programs and schools that specialized in business and economics. Students were carrying out internships in other countries. Mostly on their own initiative but it came to a standstill with the onslaught of World War II.&lt;ref name=aiese&gt;{{cite web| url= http://media.www.universitychronicle.com/media/storage/paper231/news/2003/10/02/Diversions/Aiesec.Helps.Interns.Make.Adjustments-512353.shtml| title= AIESEC Helps Interns Make Adjustments| accessdate= 2008-02-11| last= Kern| first= Beth| date= 2003-10-02| work= University Chronicle| publisher= | deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090130050156/http://media.www.universitychronicle.com/media/storage/paper231/news/2003/10/02/Diversions/Aiesec.Helps.Interns.Make.Adjustments-512353.shtml| archivedate= 2009-01-30| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the neutral Scandinavian countries were still exchanging students. In [[Stockholm]], Bertil Hedberg, an official at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]], and students Jaroslav Zich (of [[Czechoslovakia]]), Jean Choplin (of [[France]]) and Stanislas Callens (of [[Belgium]]) founded ''AIESEC''.  This was the predecessor of AIESEC,&lt;ref name=aiese/&gt; which was officially founded in 1948.  At the time, the organization's stated mission was “to expand the understanding of a nation by expanding the understanding of the individuals, changing the world one person at a time.”&lt;ref name=aiese/&gt;

At the time of AIESEC's founding at the conclusion of the 1940s, Europe was in the midst of recovery from the war that dealt grave losses to its population. Factories and enterprises were in desperate need of executives, managers and leaders. The continent needed more than just business development, however; the war had severely damaged relations between European nations, and many members of the community felt steps needed to be taken to address this problem.&lt;ref name="60 Years"&gt;{{cite web|title=AIESEC 60 Years|url=http://www.slideshare.net/afvh/aiesec-60th-23376006|access-date=2014-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217004417/http://www.slideshare.net/afvh/aiesec-60th-23376006|archive-date=2014-12-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIESEC was formed to address both of these concerns. Students from seven nations: [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] came together in March 1949 for the first International Congress of AIESEC in Stockholm.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=AIESEC History|url=https://www.aiesec.org/#/about/history|website=www.aiesec.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders composed a constitution for the new organization and defined a purpose:
"AIESEC is an independent, non-political, and international organization which has as its purpose to establish and promote the friendly relations between the members."&lt;ref name="60 Years" /&gt;

In the first year of AIESEC's existence, 89 students were exchanged among the member nations.

=== Global expansion ===

The organization grew exponentially in the following years, with more than 1,000 exchanges took place in 1955 alone. In the following few years, AIESEC quickly became global by establishing its first North American member, the [[United States]], in 1957, and its first South American and African members, [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], and [[South Africa]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=expansions&gt;{{cite web|title=AIESEC Expansions since 1948|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjx5wYjY5s|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first years of its existence, AIESEC had no central governing body, but was instead managed jointly by a Presiding Country Committee composed of the National Committee Presidents of each member nation. As the organization grew, a central governing body was created and led by democratically elected Secretary General. Morris Wolff, from the United States, was chosen as the first Secretary General in 1960, and established the first permanent international office for AIESEC in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="60 Years" /&gt; Over the following decade, AIESEC expanded to eastern Asia, [[Australia]], and deeper within Europe, Africa, North America, and South America, having a presence in 43 countries by 1969.&lt;ref name=expansions /&gt;

=== Today ===
As of 2015, AIESEC has since expanded to 127 countries and territories across the globe.&lt;ref name=numbers /&gt;&lt;ref name=expansions /&gt; AIESEC annually offers over 27,500 leadership positions and delivers over 500 leadership conferences to its membership of over 100,000 student. It is present in over 2,400 universities in its 127 member countries and territories across the globe and its international exchange program that enables over 27,500 students and recent graduates the opportunity to work or volunteer in another country. AIESEC is supported by over 8,000 partner organizations.&lt;ref name=numbers /&gt;

==Programmes==

===Campus Involvement===
AIESEC provides a platform for young people in different universities and colleges, by going on an international internship and/or by joining various local chapters. These young individuals can develop their leadership potential by working and leading international teams.  Associate membership opportunities allow young people to work with various NGO partners of AIESEC, and represent their country as a part of campus ambassador program. The organizations products are Global Talent, Global Entrepreneur, and Global Volunteer.

Each year members have an opportunity to live and work in a foreign country.  Participants can choose to work in areas of management, technology, education, or development; helping to build one's corporate skills.&lt;ref name=programmes&gt;{{cite web|title=AIESEC Programmes|url=https://www.aiesec.org/#/learnmore/students}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conferences ===
[[File:Roll call at AIESEC France's Spark 2013.jpg|thumb|Participants cheer during a local committee presentation at AIESEC France's "Spark 2013" national conference]]
AIESEC hosts over 500 conferences every year that range in length and demographic scope. The purpose of conferences are to bring the international community of AIESEC members together to enhance their professional skills, provide networking opportunities, and work on organizational strategy. Topics of interest the organization focuses on include: [[Leadership]], [[Sustainable development]], [[Entrepreneurship]], [[Innovation]], [[Corporate Social Responsibility]], and [[Generation Y|youth impact on modern society]].

=== Global Volunteer  ===
The Global Volunteer portfolio in AIESEC is an international volunteer program which allows youth aged 18-29 to contribute to the United Nations' sustainable development goals of 2030. The Global Volunteering programs are short-term in nature and provide youth with opportunities to travel abroad and work for Non-profit organizations with a special focus of second and third world countries. Projects include teaching, promoting HIV/AIDS awareness, working in human rights, environmental sustainability, leadership development and more. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.studentvolunteer.ie/view-all/become-a-global-volunteer-aiesec}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since AIESEC is a non-profit organization, the exchange participants are to bear all expenses associated with travel including airfare, medical insurance, and transportation. AIESEC will provide food and accommodation. AIESEC's partnership with the United Nations seeks to tap the undiscovered potential of the youth globally and allow them to create a long-lasting impact to boost the international community. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=23547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global Entrepreneur  ===
Global Entrepreneur is a global internship opportunity at a startup for young people who seek to develop themselves and their career. They are usually short term in nature and involve working in startup projects. Global youth unemployment has become one of the top challenges faced by the youth today. AIESEC contributes to this issue through its Global Entrepreneur program, where a young person works abroad with entrepreneurs in a startup, accelerator or incubator to advance their goals and grow; thus developing an entrepreneurial stint through a global opportunity allowing yourself to expand your network and develop on a personal and professional level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14637">'''Adaptive learning''', also known as '''adaptive teaching''', is an educational method which uses computer algorithms to orchestrate the interaction with the learner and deliver customized resources and learning activities to address the unique needs of each learner. In professional learning contexts, individuals may "test out" of some training to ensure they engage with novel instruction. Computers adapt the presentation of educational material according to students' learning needs, as indicated by their responses to questions, tasks and experiences. The technology encompasses aspects derived from various fields of study including computer science, AI, [[psychometrics]], education, psychology, and brain science.

Adaptive learning has been partially driven by a realization that tailored learning cannot be achieved on a large-scale using traditional, non-adaptive approaches. Adaptive learning systems endeavor to transform the learner from passive receptor of information to collaborator in the educational process. Adaptive learning systems' primary application is in education, but another popular application is business training.  They have been designed as desktop computer applications, web applications, and are now being introduced into overall curricula.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==

Adaptive learning or intelligent tutoring has its origins in the artificial-intelligence movement and began gaining popularity in the 1970s.  At that time, it was commonly accepted that computers would eventually achieve the human ability of adaptivity.  In adaptive learning, the basic premise is that the tool or system will be able to adjust to the student/user's learning method, which results in a better and more effective learning experience for the user.  Back in the 70's the main barrier was the cost and size of the computers, rendering the widespread application impractical.  Another hurdle in the adoption of early intelligent systems was that the user interfaces were not conducive to the learning process. The start of the work on adaptive and intelligent learning systems is usually traced back to the SCHOLAR system that offered adaptive learning for the topic of geography of South America.&lt;ref&gt;

A good account of the early work on adaptive learning and intelligent tutoring systems can be found in the classic book "Intelligent Tutoring Systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor = [[Derek H. Sleeman]]|editor2=[[John Seely Brown]] | title = Intelligent tutoring systems| date = 1982| publisher = Academic Press| URL = https://books.google.com/books?id=gfBEAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology and methodology==

Adaptive learning systems have traditionally been divided into separate components or 'models'.  While different model groups have been presented, most systems include some or all of the following models (occasionally with different names):&lt;ref&gt;Charles P. Bloom, R. Bowen Loftin ''Facilitating the Development and Use of Interactive Learning Environments'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Proposed Student Model Algorithm for Student Modeling and its Evaluation | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel3/4037/11583/00526704.pdf?isnumber=11583&amp;prod=CNF&amp;arnumber=526704&amp;arSt=1327&amp;ared=1333&amp;arAuthor=Nour%2C+M.%3B+Abed%2C+E.%3B+Hegazi%2C+N. | accessdate=August 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Expert model – The model with the information which is to be taught
* Student model – The model which tracks and learns about the student
* Instructional model – The model which actually conveys the information
* Instructional environment – The user interface for interacting with the system

===Expert model===

The expert model stores information about the material which is being taught.  This can be as simple as the solutions for the question set but it can also include lessons and tutorials and, in more sophisticated systems, even expert methodologies to illustrate approaches to the questions.

Adaptive learning systems which do not include an expert model will typically incorporate these functions in the instructional model.

===Student model===

The simplest means of determining a student's skill level is the method employed in CAT ([[computerized adaptive testing]]).  In CAT, the subject is presented with questions that are selected based on their level of difficulty in relation to the presumed skill level of the subject.  As the test proceeds, the computer adjusts the subject's score based on their answers, continuously fine-tuning the score by selecting questions from a narrower range of difficulty.

An algorithm for a CAT-style assessment is simple to implement.  A large pool of questions is amassed and rated according to difficulty, through expert analysis, experimentation, or a combination of the two.  The computer then performs what is essentially a binary search, always giving the subject a question which is halfway between what the computer has already determined to be the subject's maximum and minimum possible skill levels.  These levels are then adjusted to the level of the difficulty of the question, reassigning the minimum if the subject answered correctly, and the maximum if the subject answered incorrectly.  Obviously, a certain margin for error has to be built in to allow for scenarios where the subject's answer is not indicative of their true skill level but simply coincidental.  Asking multiple questions from one level of difficulty greatly reduces the probability of a misleading answer, and allowing the range to grow beyond the assumed skill level can compensate for possible misevaluations.

A further extension of identifying weaknesses in terms of concepts is to program the student model to analyze incorrect answers.  This is especially applicable for multiple choice questions.  Consider the following example:

:Q.  Simplify:  &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + x^3&lt;/math&gt;

:a)  Can't be simplified
:b)  &lt;math&gt;3x^5&lt;/math&gt;
:c)  ...
:d)  ...

Clearly, a student who answers (b) is adding the exponents and failing to grasp the concept of like terms.  In this case, the incorrect answer provides additional insight beyond the simple fact that it is incorrect.

===Instructional model===

The instructional model generally looks to incorporate the best educational tools that technology has to offer (such as multimedia presentations) with expert teacher advice for presentation methods.  The level of sophistication of the instructional model depends greatly on the level of sophistication of the student model.  In a CAT-style student model, the instructional model will simply rank lessons in correspondence with the ranks for the question pool.  When the student's level has been satisfactorily determined, the instructional model provides the appropriate lesson.  The more advanced student models which assess based on concepts need an instructional model which organizes its lessons by concept as well.  The instructional model can be designed to analyze the collection of weaknesses and tailor a lesson plan accordingly.

When the incorrect answers are being evaluated by the student model, some systems look to provide feedback to the actual questions in the form of 'hints'.  As the student makes mistakes, useful suggestions pop up such as "look carefully at the sign of the number".  This too can fall in the domain of the instructional model, with generic concept-based hints being offered based on concept weaknesses, or the hints can be question-specific in which case the student, instructional, and expert models all overlap.

==Implementations==

===Distance learning===
Adaptive learning systems can be implemented on the Internet for use in [[distance learning]] and group collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gladsolutions.co.uk/personalised-elearning | title=Personalised Elearning – Tailored Pathways | accessdate=January 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of distance learning is now incorporating aspects of adaptive learning. Initial systems without adaptive learning were able to provide automated feedback to students who are presented questions from a preselected question bank. That approach however lacks the guidance which teachers in the classroom can provide. Current trends in distance learning call for the use of adaptive learning to implement intelligent dynamic behavior in the learning environment.

During the time a student spends learning a new concept they are tested on their abilities and databases track their progress using one of the models. The latest generation of distance learning systems take into account the students' answers and adapt themselves to the student's cognitive abilities using a concept called 'cognitive scaffolding'. [[Instructional scaffolding|Cognitive scaffolding]] is the ability of an automated learning system to create a cognitive path of assessment from lowest to highest based on the demonstrated cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15568725 | title=Cognitive scaffolding for a web-based adaptive learning environment |  accessdate=August 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A current successful implementation of adaptive learning in web-based distance learning is the Maple engine of WebLearn by RMIT university.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/auckland02/proceedings/papers/216.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918130455/http://ascilite.org.au/conferences/auckland02/proceedings/papers/216.pdf |archivedate=September 18, 2010 | title=Addressing Different Cognitive Levels for On-line Learning | accessdate=August 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; WebLearn is advanced enough that it can provide assessment of questions posed to students even if those questions have no unique answer like those in the Mathematics field.

Adaptive learning can be incorporated to facilitate group collaboration within distance learning environments like forums or resource sharing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ia.uned.es/~elena/papers/gb-aied03preprint.pdf |title=Towards web-based adaptive learning communities |accessdate=August 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060604031047/http://www.ia.uned.es/~elena/papers/gb-aied03preprint.pdf |archivedate=June 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of how adaptive learning can help with collaboration include automated grouping of users with the same interests, and personalization of links to information sources based on the user's stated interests or the user's surfing habits.

===Game design===
In 2014, an educational researcher concluded a multi-year study of adaptive learning for educational game design. The research developed and validated the ALGAE (Adaptive Learning GAme dEsign) model, a comprehensive adaptive learning model based on game design theories and practices, instructional strategies, and adaptive models. The research extended previous researching in game design, instructional strategies, and adaptive learning, combining those three components into a single complex model.

The study resulted in the development of an adaptive educational game design model to serve as a guide for game designers, instructional designers, and educators with the goal of increasing learning outcomes. Survey participants validated the value of the ALGAE model and provided specific insights on the model's construction, use, benefits, and challenges. The current ALGAE model is based on these insights. The model now serves as a guideline for the design and development of educational computer games.

The model's applicability is assessed as being cross-industry including government and military agencies/units, game industry, and academia. The model's actual value and the appropriate implementation approach (focused or unfocused) will be fully realized as the ALGAE model's adoption becomes more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lavieri|first1=Edward|title=A Study of Adaptive Learning for Educational Game Design|date=2014|publisher=ProQuest UMI|isbn=9781321049602|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1562778630|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development tools==
While adaptive learning features are often mentioned in the marketing materials of tools, the range of adaptivity can be dramatically different.  Entry-level tools tend to focus on determining the learner's pathway based on simplistic criteria such as the learner's answer to a multiple choice question.  A correct answer may take the learner to Path A, whereas an incorrect answer may take them to Path B.  While these tools provide an adequate method for basic branching, they are often based on an underlying linear model whereby the learner is simply being redirected to a point somewhere along a predefined line.  Due to this, their capabilities fall short of true adaptivity.  At the other end of the spectrum, there are advanced tools which enable the creation of very complex adaptions based on any number of complex conditions.  These conditions may relate to what the learner is currently doing, prior decisions, behavioral tracking, interactive and external activities to name a few.  These higher end tools generally have no underlying navigation as they tend to utilize AI methods such as an inference engine.  Due to the fundamental design difference advanced tools are able to provide rich assessment capabilities.  Rather than taking a simple multiple choice question, the learner may be presented with a complex simulation where a number of factors are considered to determine how the learner should adapt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6758">'''Alberto Pérez-Gómez''' (born 24 December 1949) is an eminent [[architectural history|architectural historian]]. He is also well known as an theorist with an orientation rooted in a [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenological]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; approach to architecture.

==Biography==
Born December 24, 1949, in [[Mexico City]] he graduated as an engineer and architect from the [[National Polytechnic Institute|National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico]]. Afterwards he did postgraduate work at Cornell University. He then pursued graduate studies in the History and Theory of Architecture at the [[University of Essex]] where he received his [[Master of Arts]] in 1975 and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1979.  In 1987 he became a Canadian Citizen and a Quebec resident. In 1984, he won the [[Alice Davis Hitchcock Award]] for his book ''Architecture and the Crisis of Modern Science''.&lt;ref&gt;Giamarelos, S. (2015) Interdisciplinary Deflections: Histories of the Scientific Revolution in Alberto Pérez-Gómez's Architecture and the Crisis of Modern Science. ''Journal of Architectural Education'' Vol. 69, Iss. 1, http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10464883.2015.987069&lt;/ref&gt; He has taught and lectured at various schools of architecture around the world and was director of the [[Carleton University]] School of Architecture from 1983 to 1986. Currently, he runs the History and Theory of Architecture program at the [[McGill University]] [[McGill University School of Architecture|School of Architecture]], where he is the [[Saidye Rosner Bronfman]] Professor in History and Theory of Architecture.

Dr. Pérez-Gómez is the author of numerous volumes of architectural scholarship.''Polyphilo or The Dark Forest Revisited'' (MIT Press, 1992), an erotic narrative/theory of architecture that retells the love story of the famous fifteenth century novel/treatise ''Hypnerotomachia Poliphili'' in late twentieth-century terms, a text that has become the source of numerous projects and exhibitions (http://www.polyphilo.com). A Spanish version translated by the author was published as ''El Sueño de Polyfilo. El Origen Erótico del Significado Arquitectónico'' (Universidad Iberoamericana, 2012). He was co-editor of the well-known book series ''CHORA: Intervals in the Philosophy of Architecture'' vol. 1-7 (McGill-Queen's University Press) together with Stephen Parcell, which collects essays exploring fundamental questions concerning the practice of architecture through its history and theories. He co-authored a major book with Louise Pelletier, ''Architectural Representation and the Perspective Hinge'' (MIT Press, 1997), tracing the history and theory of modern European architectural representation, with special reference to the role of projection in architectural design. In ''Built Upon Love: Architectural Longing after Ethics and Aesthetics'' (MIT Press, 2006), Pérez-Gómez examines points of convergence between ethics and poetics in architectural history and philosophy, and draws important conclusions for contemporary practice. His most recent title, ''Attunement, Architectural Meaning after the Crisis of Modern Science'' (MIT Press, 2016) calls for an architecture that can enhance our human values and capacities, an architecture that is connected—attuned—to its location and its inhabitants. Architecture, Pérez-Gómez explains, operates as a communicative setting for societies; its beauty and its meaning lie in its connection to human health and self-understanding.

==Early life==

He was born in [[Milan]], [[Italy]].  After early education by the [[Somaschi Fathers|Somascan Religious Order]] and then at [[:it:Collegio arcivescovile Alessandro Volta|Alessandro Volta College]] in [[Lecco]], in 1949 he went to the school of architecture at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]].  His thesis advisor was [[:it:Piero Portaluppi|Piero Portaluppi]] and he  graduated in 1959.

In 1955 he had started writing for, and from 1959 was one of the editors of, the architectural magazine [[Casabella|Casabella-Continuità]], with editor in chief [[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]]. Rossi left in 1964, when the chief editorship went to Gian Antonio Bernasconi. Rossi went on to work for [[:it:Società (rivista)|Società magazine]] and Il_contemporaneo, making him one of the most active participants in the fervent cultural debate of the time.

His early articles cover architects such as [[Alessandro Antonelli]],  [[:it:Mario Ridolfi|Mario Ridolfi]], [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Emil Kaufmann]] and much of this material became part of his second book, ''Scritti scelti sull'architettura e la città 1956-1972'' (''Selected writings on architecture and the city from 1956 to 1972''). He married the Swiss actress Sonia Gessner, who introduced him to the world of film and theater. Culture and his family became central to his life. His son Fausto was active in movie-making both in front of and behind the camera and his daughter Vera was involved with theatre.

==Career==

He began his professional career at the studio of [[Ignazio Gardella]] in 1956, moving on to the studio of [[Marco Zanuso]]. In 1963 also he began teaching, firstly as an assistant to [[:it:Ludovico Quaroni|Ludovico Quaroni]] (1963) at the school of urban planning in [[Arezzo]], then to [[Carlo Aymonino]] at the [[Università Iuav di Venezia|Institute of Architecture in Venice]]. In 1965 he was appointed lecturer at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]] and the following year he published ''The architecture of the city'' which soon became a classic of architectural literature.

His professional career, initially dedicated to architectural theory and small building work took a huge leap forward when [[Carlo Aymonino|Aymonino]] allowed Rossi to design part of the [[Monte Amiata Housing|Monte Amiata complex]] in the [[Gallaratese|Gallaratese quarter]] of Milan. In 1971 he won the design competition for the extension of the San Cataldo Cemetery in [[Modena]], which made him internationally famous.

After suspension from teaching in Italy in those politically troubled times, he moved to [[ETH Zurich]], occupying the chair in architectural design from 1971 to 1975.

In 1973 he was director of the International Architecture Section at the [[:it:XV Triennale di Milano|XV Milan Triennial Exhibition of Decorative Arts and Modern Architecture]], where he presented, among others, his student [[Arduino Cantafora]].  Rossi's design ideas for the exhibition are explained in the International Architecture Catalogue and in a 16mm documentary ''Ornament and crime'' directed by Luigi Durissi and produced along with Gianni Braghieri and Franco Raggi.  In 1975, Rossi returned to the teaching profession in Italy, teaching architectural composition in Venice.

In 1979 he was made a member of the prestigious [[Accademia di San Luca|Academy of Saint Luke]]. Meanwhile, there was international interest in his skills.  He taught at several universities in the United States, including [[Cooper Union]] in New York City and [[Cornell University]] in Ithaca (New York State).  At Cornell he participated in the ''Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies'' joint venture with New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], travelling to China and Hong Kong and attending conferences in South America.

In 1981 he published his autobiography, ''A scientific autobiography''. In this work the author, "in discrete disorder", brings back memories, objects, places, forms, literature notes, quotes, and insights and tries to "... go over things or impressions, describe, or look for ways to describe."  In the same year he won first prize at the international competition for the design of an apartment block on the corner of Kochstraße and Wilhelmstraße in central [[Berlin]].

In 1984 together with [[Ignazio Gardella]] and [[Fabio Reinhart]], he won the competition for the renovation of the [[Teatro Carlo Felice]] in [[Genoa]], which was not fully completed until 1991. In 1985 and 1986 Rossi was director of the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture|3rd (respectively 4th) International Architecture Exhibition]] at the [[Venice Biennale]] including further away display spaces such as Villa Farsetti in [[Santa Maria di Sala]].

In 1987 he won two international competitions: one for a site at the [[Parc de la Villette]] in Paris, the other for the [[Deutsches Historisches Museum]] in Berlin, which was never brought to fruition. In 1989 he continued product design work for Unifor (now part of [[:it:Molteni&amp;C|Molteni Furniture]]) and [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]]. His espresso maker ''La Cupola'', designed for Alessi came out in 1988.

In 1990 he was awarded the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name=Goldberger1990&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberger|first1=Paul|title=Aldo Rossi: Sentiment For The Unsentimental|work=New York Times|date=22 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of [[Fukuoka]] in Japan honoured him for his work on the hotel complex ''The Palace'' and he won the 1991 Thomas Jefferson Medal in Public Architecture from the [[American Institute of Architects]]. These prestigious awards were followed by exhibitions at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris, the [[Beurs van Berlage]] in Amsterdam, the [[Berlinische Galerie]] in Berlin and the [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Ghent, Belgium.

In 1996 he became an honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and the following year he received their special cultural award in architecture and design.  He died in Milan on 4 September 1997, following a car accident. Posthumously he received the ''[[Torre Guinigi]]'' prize for his contribution to urban studies and the ''Seaside Prize'' of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150509102932/http://seasideinstitute.org/what-we-do/ Seaside Institute], Florida, where he had built a detached family home in 1995.

On appeal his proposals won the 1999 competition for the restoration of the [[Teatro La Fenice]], Venice and it reopened in 2004.  In 1999 the Faculty of Architecture of the [[University of Bologna]], based in [[Cesena]], was named after him.

==Work==

[[File:Aldo Rossi La Cupola Alessi Coffee Maker Austin Calhoon Photograph.jpg|thumb|200px|Aldo Rossi La Cupola Espresso Maker 1988, produced by Alessi]]
His earliest works of the 1960s were mostly theoretical and displayed a simultaneous influence of 1920s [[Italian modernism]] (''see [[Giuseppe Terragni]]''), classicist influences of Viennese architect [[Adolf Loos]], and the reflections of the painter [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. A trip to the [[Soviet Union]] to study [[Stalinist architecture]] also left a marked impression.

In his writings Rossi criticized the lack of understanding of the city in current architectural practice. He argued that a city must be studied and valued as something constructed over time; of particular interest are urban artifacts that withstand the passage of time. Rossi held that the city remembers its past (our "collective memory"), and that we use that memory through monuments; that is, monuments give structure to the city. Inspired by the persistence of Europe's ancient cities, Rossi strove to create similar structures immune to obsolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279–298|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Aldo Rossi, Modena Cemetery, Model, c.1983.jpg.png|thumb|right|200px|Model of San Cataldo Cemetery, [[Modena]], Italy, 1971-]]  --&gt;
He became extremely influential in the late 1970s and 1980s as his body of built work expanded and for his theories promoted in his books ''[[The Architecture of the City]]'' (''L'architettura della città'', 1966) and ''A Scientific Autobiography'' (''Autobiografia scientifica'', 1981).The largest of Rossi's projects in terms of scale was the San Cataldo Cemetery, in [[Modena]], Italy, which began in 1971 but is yet to be completed. Rossi referred to it as a "city of the dead".

The distinctive independence of his buildings is reflected in the micro-architectures of the products designed by Rossi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buerdek |first=Bernhard E. |year=2005 |title=Design: History, theory and practice of product design |url= |location=Basel, Switzerland |publisher=Birkhauser-Publishers for Architecture |isbn=978-3-764-37029-9 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s Rossi designed stainless steel [[French press|cafetières]] and other products for [[Alessi (company)|Alessi]], [[Pirelli]], and others.

[[File:Bonnefanten2013-04.jpg|thumb|200px|Central staircase [[Bonnefanten Museum]], [[Maastricht]]]]

==Exhibits==

For the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1979 Rossi designed a floating ''Teatro del Mondo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archidose.blogspot.com/1999/02/teatro-del-mondo.html |title=Teatro del Mondo |date=8 February 1999 |access-date=29 October 2018 |work=A Daily Dose of Architecture |first=John |last=Hill |publisher=[[Blogspot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that seated 250 people. For the Venice Biennale in 1984, he designed a triumphal arch at the entrance to the exhibition site. In 2006 two [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] based on an original 1989 design by Aldo Rossi were erected in front of the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht by the Delft architectural firm Ufo Architecten.

'''Business game''' (also called '''business simulation game''') refers to [[simulation game]]s that are used as an [[education]]al tool for teaching business. Business games may be carried out for various business training such as: general management, finance, organizational behaviour, human resources, etc. Often, the term "[[business simulation]]" is used with the same meaning.

A business game has been defined as "a game with a business environment that can lead to one or both of the following results: the training of players in business skills (hard and/or soft) or the evaluation of players' performances (quantitatively and/or qualitatively)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greco|first=Marco|author2=Baldissin, Nicola |author3=Nonino, Fabio |title=An Exploratory Taxonomy of Business Games|journal=Simulation &amp; Gaming|date=2013|volume=44|issue=5|pages=645–682|url=http://sag.sagepub.com/content/44/5/645.full.pdf+html|accessdate=4 May 2015|doi=10.1177/1046878113501464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business games are used as a [[teaching method]] in [[universities]], and more particularly in [[business schools]], but also for [[executive education]].

Simulation are considered to be an innovative learning method {{Harv|Aldrich|2004}}, and are often computer-based.

== History ==
Computer-supported business simulation originated from military war games and came into existence during the late 1950s {{Harv|Wells|1990}}. [[Business simulation game]]s, including non-computer-based board games and experiential activities, have since been used as a learning tool for teaching management {{Harv|Jackson|1959}} {{Harv|Andlinger|1958}}. It is regularly in use at Universities, and in particularly by major business schools. As an example, the [[University of Washington]] has been using business simulation game in classes since 1957 {{Harv|Saunders|1996|p=49}}.

The INTOP tool was developed at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1963, and was employed for teaching in 160 institutions worldwide over the period 1963–1995.  Its successor [[Intopia|INTOPIA]] was first released in 1995, and it has been used by universities in over 55 countries around the world, including 18 in the U.S.

Business games are also used within companies for management training and development {{Harv|Faria|1990}}.

'''Carmelite Brewer Christie''' was a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] missionary in Turkey from 1877 to 1920 and served as the acting president of the [[Tarsus American College|St. Paul's College]], during World War I. She was the College's sole American caretaker, though her husband [[Thomas Davidson Christie]] was the named president. She wrote letters and kept diaries which are part of the [[Minnesota Historical Society]] Christie Collection and provide a first-hand account of the [[Hamidian massacres|Armenian massacre of 1895]], [[Defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkish politics]] in the pre- and post-[[World War I]] era, the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915 and its aftermath. During the [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909|1909 Riots and unrest]], she refused to abandon the school, students and refugees who had fled there, guarding up to 5,000 people under her protection and hoisting the American flag.

==Early life==
Sarah Carmelite Brewer, known as Carmelite, was born in [[Lee Center, Illinois]] on 25 April 1852 to Elizabeth (née Pratt) and Rev. James Brewer.{{sfn|Leonard|1914|p=177}}{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}} On her father's side of the family, she was descended from Captain John Brewer, veteran of the [[French and Indian War]] and a relative of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice|Justice]], [[David Josiah Brewer]].{{sfn|Leonard|1914|p=177}} Carmelite was a cousin{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} of Rev. [[Josiah Brewer]], father of Justice Brewer, who was an early missionary and school founder sent by the American Board to Greece and Turkey.{{sfn|Sekulow|2007|p=134}}{{sfn|Sterling Memorial Library|1965}} He was one reason Thomas and Carmelite ended up in Turkey.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Her father was a preacher who graduated from [[Williams College]] some 30 years after the [[Haystack Prayer Meeting]] which resulted in the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]]. After graduation he taught in schools in the South. He joined his brother Ira after riding from [[Montgomery, Alabama]] to Lee County in 1847. James was a farmer and a principal of the new academy in Lee Center in 1850. He was ordained in 1859. 

She graduated in 1871 from the [[Rockford University|Rockford Seminary for Women]], a progressive academy. Rockford was the sister college of [[Beloit College]] in Wisconsin. She taught school in Lee Center until she married a graduate of Beloit, [[Thomas Davidson Christie]] on 14 March 1872.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}}

== Missionary period==
Carmelite joined her new husband in Wisconsin, where he taught at Beloit College and the [[University of Wisconsin]], while working on his master's degree, and she began their family with the births of their first two daughters, Elizabeth Norton. Thomas and his young family went to [[Andover Theological Seminary]] for his further studies. Their daughter Anna Carmelite was born in there in 1875. Daughter Elizabeth died of scarlet fever in 1876. Thomas graduated and was ordained as a minister the next year.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}} Carmelite was appointed as a missionary by the [[American Board of Missions]] in [[Ottoman Empire|Asiatic Turkey]] in 1877.{{sfn|Leonard|1914|p=177}} Thomas, Carmelite and their young daughter Anna moved to [[Marash]], Turkey that same year, where he taught at the Central Turkey Theological Seminary.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}}{{sfn|''Missionary Review of the World''|1922|p=790}} In addition to preparing young men for college in the period between 1877 and 1893, she expanded their family to include: Emerson Brewer, Mary Phelps, Paul Theodore, Agnes Emily, and Jean Ogilvy.{{sfn|Leonard|1914|p=177}}

Carmelite and the children returned to the Beloit for the period from 1888 to 1890 for the children's education and then returned to Turkey.
In 1893 the family moved to [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] to take up a post at St. Paul's College. Carmelite by character and situation assumed non-traditional roles overseas. As part of his duties, Thomas left Turkey to raise money or went to surrounding mission stations to support them. In addition to her family responsibilities, she was involved in the activities of St. Paul's College and the education of women{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}} and a supporter of [[women's suffrage|suffrage]] for unmarried women.{{sfn|Leonard|1914|p=177}} After the 1895 [[Hamidian massacres|massacre at Marash]], Carmelite wrote letters describing the events which were published in American newspapers. She reported on deaths, woundings, damage to the schools in Marash and threats to the missionary workers. Her reports were personal, having spent fifteen years among those who were living through the crisis and in one letter, she reported that she and her husband had been warned regarding violence which might spread to Tarsus.{{sfn|''The Inter Ocean''|1896|p=7}} By August, the rioting had reached them, though the Christies were not at the school when it was looted.{{sfn|''The Chicago Daily Tribune''|1895|p=2}}{{sfn|''The Democrat and Chronicle''|1895|p=3}} In the face of the ongoing violence, the family fled to [[Mersina]], and eventually Carmelite returned with the children to the United States between 1897 and 1898 for their safety and schooling.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}}{{sfn|''The Evening Star''|1895|p=1}}

===1909 riots===
Carmelite's son-in-law Rev. Miner Rogers, Reverend [[Herbert Adams Gibbons]] and her husband went to the annual conference of Armenian ministers and expatriate missionaries in [[Adana]], Turkey on 13 April 1909. While they were there Rogers and another missionary Henry Maurer, were killed by gunfire during the [[Adana massacre]]. The men were carrying water to put out a fire in order to protect a missionary run dispensary. Thomas Christie could not immediately return to Tarsus. During the week he was away, some of the rioters went to Tarsus. Locals joined them in setting the Tarsus Armenian quarter on fire. Through Carmelite's efforts, the school survived despite protecting around 5,000 refugees on the grounds of the College.{{sfn|''Missionary Review of the World''|1922|p=794}}{{sfn|Gibbons|1917|pp=100, 111-127}} When regular soldiers began to join in with the violence and the mob turned toward the campus, Carmelite raised an American flag and refused the evacuation request of the consular saying, "I prefer to die with my students and the Armenian people than to hand them over to Turks and save myself." The campus was surrounded by the mob, which replaced the water in the fire extinguishing system with kerosene to torch the school and refugees, when word to cease the hostilities was received from the [[Young Turks]] in [[Constantinople]].{{sfn|Jernazian|1990|p=24}}

Thomas and Gibbons returned to tell of Rogers' death to their own wives, and break the news to his daughter Mary and her infant child.{{sfn|Gibbons|1917|pp=136-138}} Carmelite nursed and comforted the injured and dying, provided food for them and she and Helen Gibbons sewed clothes for infants.{{sfn|''Missionary Review of the World''|1922|p=794}}{{sfn|Gibbons|1917|pp=137-148}} For two weeks after the violence, Carmelite was called upon to give constant care to the sick, the children of the refugees{{sfn|Jernazian|1990|p=25}} and orphans.{{sfn|Leonard|1914|p=177}} However, within months of the events, the school was back in operation. Carmelite gave a glowing report of their progress under her leadership as acting president while her husband was back in the states.{{sfn|''The Courier-Journal''|1909|p=25}}

===Results of the Tehcir Law of 1915 and World War I===
The Christies were at St. Paul's when the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers at the start of WWI. The [[Tehcir Law|Tehcir (forced displacement) Law]] and another law which allowed expropriation and confiscation of Armenian property was passed by the Ottoman Parliament in May 1915. Teachers and students at St. Paul's were ordered to leave Tarsus for Syria.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Thomas traveled in June 1915 to [[Constantinople]] to request that the government not deport teachers or students. He was not allowed to return to Tarsus for the duration of the conflict.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}} A short time later, Carmelite arranged for her family and future son-in-law to leave for America but she stayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christie|first1=Sarah C. B.|author2=Amerikan Bord Heyeti (American Board), Istanbul|title=Memorial records for Sarah C.B. Christie|website=Digital Library for International Research|publisher=American Research Institute in Turkey, Istanbul Center Library, online in Digital Library for International Research Archive|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170118180611/http://www.dlir.org/archive/items/show/16785|archivedate=18 January 2017|accessdate=18 January 2017|url=http://www.dlir.org/archive/items/show/16785|pages=2|format=jpg|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the War, she kept the College open, distributed relief supplies and chronicled events in a summary she sent to the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions after the war ended. In her summary, Carmelite chronicles how the Turkish Army requested use of their halls for regimental soldiers and officers, for use a hospital during the [[cholera]] and [[typhus]] epidemic in 1915, and as a quarters to house English prisoners of war. Carmelite negotiated with the authorities, making small concessions during the war which allowed them to keep operating the college.{{sfn|Christie|1919|pp=1-3}}{{sfn|Özdemir|2005|p=65}} In addition, she provided aid to refugees, writing, "...100,000 exiles were said to have passed Tarsus en route for regions beyond. Of these, we helped as many as we could with money, food and clothing where it was possible by protecting them. Some of these we hid, for others we found work that counted as Government service, and so saved them from being deported further."{{sfn|Christie|1919|p=4}}

Carmelite made regular visits to families, local officials and the military (including several audiences with [[Enver Pasha]]). Her diary chronicled the stream of Armenians from all over Turkey that passed through Tarsus. Most were on foot and were being directed to Syria. She also noted the wounded coming back from the front and the conditions which ethnic Turks and Armenians suffered during the war. Thomas returned to briefly to Tarsus in 1919, not a well man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christie|first1=Thomas Davidson|author2=Amerikan Bord Heyeti (American Board), Istanbul|title=Memorial records for Thomas D. Christie|website=Digital Library for International Research|publisher=American Research Institute in Turkey, Istanbul Center Library, online in Digital Library for International Research Archive|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170118181038/http://www.dlir.org/archive/items/show/16786|archivedate=18 January 2017|accessdate=18 January 2017|url=http://www.dlir.org/archive/items/show/16786|pages=2|format=jpg|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diary==
Carmelite made entries in a diary from 1868 to 1931. About 20 of these volumes, along with correspondence, address books and memorandums are in the Minnesota Historical Society's archives.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}} They have been used by historians and researchers. Her entries during her time at Tarsus are controversial in the context of interpretation events surround Turkish, Armenian, Kurdish, Greek, various political and religious groups. 

Rev. Richard Walker Rockwell supplied Arnold Toynbee with what was reported to be a transcribed copy of Mrs. Christie's diary, with many peoples names omitted or noted with initials. Toynbee edited the "Blue Book" in 1916 and included some entries of Mrs. Christie. At the time, Turkish critics said the Blue Book was an exaggeration, events fabricated by missionaries and was clearly a piece of WWI British propaganda. They pointed out that Toynbee pressured Rev. Rockwell for names, so as editor he could assure the reader these people existed. Toynbee did not get the names but included Mrs. Christie's entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=James|first1=Bryce|last2=Toynbee|first2=Arnold|title=The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915-1916: |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0953519155|year=2000|publisher=[[Gomidas Institute]]|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780953519156|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, her diaries document her activities and her opinions about events around her, including her family.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

== Later life ==
In 1919, Carmelite and Thomas returned to the United States, where briefly Thomas became pastor at the Union Church in [[Palm Springs, California]].{{sfn|Nichols|1921|p=461}} After the couple's daughter Agnes, who had been suffering from ill health, committed suicide in December 1919, the couple's youngest daughter, Jean, went to Tarsus to help her mother prepare to return to the United States.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}} They made their home in [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock California]] among a [[History of the Armenian Americans in Los Angeles|large community of Armenians]]. Thomas died in 1921. In the last years of her life, Carmelite lived in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] with her daughter Jean, who taught at [[Occidental College]].{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}}

==Death and legacy ==
Carmelite died on October 17, 1931, in Pasadena.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}} She and Thomas are buried in Newton Cemetery (Massachusetts) in the American Missionary Board plot.&lt;ref&gt; Sarah Carmelite Brewer Christie gavestone https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/88265706 &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Minnesota Historical Society]] was given a trunk full of Christie family letters in 1965. The Christie family was asked to give or make copies of other letters and diaries for a permanent Christie collection. In 2016, the collection occupies over 20 cubic feet for Thomas &amp; his family and about the same for his father and siblings. This collection includes Carmelite's continuous diary she kept from 1865 to 1931, giving important historical, first person accounts of the turbulent times of Turkey's history at the turn of the twentieth century through the First World War.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}}

== Children ==
Five of Carmelite's six surviving children were born in Turkey. The more notable have a common thread that echoed Carmelite's own life of social service and education.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}}

Anna Carmelite Christie (1875-1910) was born in Wisconsin and traveled to Turkey with her parents when they moved there. She had poor health and though schooled in both Europe and the United States, she spent much of her life living in the U.S. quietly pursuing musical interests and performing charitable works.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}}

Emerson Brewer Christie (1878-1967) was a noted linguist and ethnologist. He graduated from Yale, taught at St. Paul's College and then in the Philippines. He also taught at [[University of Michigan]] and [[Temple University]]. He was Chief of the US State Department's Bureau of Translation from 1928-1944.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}}

Mary Phelps Christie (1881-1975) was born in and spent a great deal of her life in Turkey. She attended [[Bryn Mawr College]] and studied at the [[Hartford Female Seminary]], graduating in 1908. Mary married Daniel Miner Rogers (1882-1909) and they joined her parents in Tarsus. After the death of Rogers, she returned with their child to the United States. In 1911 she returned to Tarsus to teach. She met her second husband William Nute and they married in Tarsus. Mary and her child returned to the States so William could complete his medical training. They returned to Turkey where Mary taught and William ran rural medical clinics, until their retirement, when she returned to California.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}}

Paul Theodore Christie (1883-1959) was born and raised in Turkey. As his siblings, he was sent away as a teenager for further education. Paul attended schools in Greece, Switzerland and Germany. He graduated from [[Hotchkiss School]] in 1903 and [[Harvard University]] in 1907. He was a French teacher and athletic coach at [[St. George's School, Newport|St. Georges School]] until World War II. He retired and during the war worked at a Grumman airplane factory as a riveter in California. He continued to teach swimming until he died.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}}

Agnes Emily Christie (1887-1919) attended schools in Europe and the United States, though her education was interrupted because of poor health at various times. Trained as a [[dental hygienist]], she worked in that field until she became depressed and committed suicide.{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}}

Jean Ogilvie Christie (1891-1984) graduated from [[Wellesley College]] in 1915. She returned to Turkey and taught in Constantinople. Jean was forced to stop teaching there in 1917 and worked with the YMCA in France. Jean helped her mother return to the United States and settle in California in 1920. She was a teacher at [[Occidental College]]{{sfn|Minnesota Historical Society|1965}} and at the University of California, Berkeley. She was married to Eugene V. Lien.

A '''compendium''' (plural: '''compendia''') is a concise compilation of a [[Body of knowledge|body]] of [[knowledge]]. A compendium may summarize a larger work. In most cases the body of knowledge will concern a specific field of human interest or endeavour (for example: [[hydrogeology]], [[logology]], [[ichthyology]], [[phytosociology]] or [[myrmecology]]), while a general [[encyclopedia]] can be referred to as a ''compendium of all human knowledge''.

The word compendium arrives from the Latin word "compenso", meaning "to weigh together or balance". The 21st century has seen the rise of democratized, online compendia in various fields.{{verification needed|date=May 2017}}

An example would be the ''Compendium of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', a concise 598-question-and-answer book which summarises the teachings of the Catholic Faith and Morals.&lt;ref&gt;''Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church'' (USCCB 2005), 200 pages, English hardcover {{ISBN|978-1-57455-720-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bible]] is another example of a compendium—a group of many writings of the prophets and apostles over a period of time, whose books are put together to form the Old Testament and the New Testament.

Some well known literary figures have written their own compendium. An example would be [[Alexandre Dumas]], author of [[The Three Musketeers]], and an enthusiastic gourmand. His compendium on food titled ''From Absinthe to Zest'' serves as an alphabet for food lovers.

The [[bestiary]], popular in the Middle Ages, is another example of a compendium. Bestiaries cataloged animals and facts about natural history and were particularly popular in England and France around the 12th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4808">'''Curriculum 2000''' was a reform of [[Advanced Level (UK)|A Level]] examinations in the [[United Kingdom]].  It was introduced in September 2000 (with the first AS-Level examinations held in Summer 2001 and A2 examinations the following year). An A Level under this reform consists of four or six units studied over two years. Normally, two or three units are assessed at the end of the first year, and make up a stand-alone Advanced Subsidiary (AS Level) qualification. Another two or three modules are assessed at the end of the second year, which make up the A2 Level.  A2 units do not form a qualification in their own right; the satisfactory completion of the AS and A2 units in the same subject is required to constitute a complete A Level qualification.

Due to the modular structure, units could be taken in January and June of the year, though January exams were abolished after the January 2013 exam session. To begin with each unit could only be retaken once, but this limit was later removed. Some schools choose to conduct all AS and A2 examinations at the end of the first or second years. In the former case, this means students complete the A-level in one year, which is possible for more academically able students. In the latter case, students do not have the opportunity to resit any units and have a more stressful workload at the end of their second year, although by reducing the amount of time taken for exam leave and conducting examinations, more time is available to study the subject in more depth.

Units are assessed by exam papers marked by national organisations and internally assessed [[coursework]]. Four organisations set and mark exam papers in England and Wales: [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance]] (AQA), [[Edexcel]], [[Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations]] (OCR) and the [[Welsh Joint Education Committee]] (WJEC). The [[Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment]] (CCEA) sets them in Northern Ireland. International exams managed by [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIE) also have A-levels in a variety of subjects.

== Response ==
The reaction to the new style and structure of qualifications was mixed; whilst many schools and colleges welcomed the increased flexibility and the nature of the modules, the [[Key Skills]] courses were increasingly targeted as a failure. Many students were exempt from taking these courses as they had the relevant GCSEs, leaving some classes empty. General apathy towards the courses from UCAS and most universities meant that Key Skills was dropped from some LEAs requirements by the end of 2003.

Some have criticised the modular system for nurturing a 'resit culture' due to the 'generous' resit system, and causing perceived 'grade inflation' where the proportion of candidates achieving higher grades increases, thus eroding the value of those grades. Additionally, while the most academically able candidates benefited from completing some of the subject content early, some felt ill-prepared to take half of their A level exams only a year after taking GCSE exams, not having a second year to improve their grades. Michael Gove, who implemented the A level changes which succeeded Curriculum 2000 has described the modular system as an exam 'treadmill' due to the frequency of examinations.

== Succession ==
For first teaching from 2015 through 2018 it was succeeded by a new curriculum (first assessment 2017), which reversed most changes brought in by Curriculum 2000 (reverting to linear qualifications where all exams are taken at the end of each course), though kept AS Levels as standalone qualifications which still encompass the first year of the full A level content. Most traditional subjects were reformed in 2015, followed by more in successive years. The changes will be complete by 2018.

The blog MySexProfessor.com was run by Dr. Herbenick from 2007 to 2014. She is also the founder of the Bloomington Sex Salon, an event series in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], and the Make Sex Normal project, which she launched with a highly viewed TEDx talk in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Making sex normal {{!}} Debby Herbenick {{!}} TEDxBloomington|date=2013-05-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE3tL9MMk3U|accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DrawBot''' is an [[Free and open source software|open source]] application for [[OS X]] that allows users to write simple [[Python (programming language)|Python]] scripts to generate two-dimensional graphics. The builtin graphics primitives support rectangles, ovals, (bezier) paths, polygons, text objects and transparency.

DrawBot primarily serves an educational purpose, used as a tool to teach the basics of programming. Students get graphical feedback for [[positive reinforcement]] via coding.  They learn programming structures such as  variables, conditional statements, functions.  DrawBot is used by the [[Royal Academy of Art (The Hague)|Royal Academy]].

DrawBot is written in Python, with a fully self-sufficient binary.

A '''drill instructor''' is a [[non-commissioned officer]] in the [[armed forces]] or [[police forces]] with specific duties that vary by country.  For example, in the [[Military of the United States|United States armed forces]], they are assigned the duty of [[Recruit training|training new recruits]] entering the military.

Drill instructors within the U.S. armed forces have different titles in each branch of service. In the [[United States Air Force]], they are known as "Military Training Instructors", or MTIs.&lt;ref name="Title of U.S.A.F.

The instruction and indoctrination given by the drill instructors of the various U.S. military branches includes instruction in customs and practices of military life, physical fitness, instruction in the proper execution of [[Foot drill|military drill]], instilling discipline and willingness to immediately obey all [[Superior orders|lawful orders]] given by superiors, and oftentimes, basic armed and unarmed combat training.

==Australia==

===Australian Army===
In the [[Australian Army]], the staff responsible for training recruits are known as Recruit Instructors. They teach recruits discipline, fieldcraft, marksmanship, service knowledge and drill.

Each recruit platoon is commanded by Recruit Instructors usually consisting of a [[Lieutenant]], a [[Sergeant]] and up to four instructors of the [[Corporal]] or [[Bombardier (rank)|Bombardier]] rank. A Recruit Instructor can be identified by a [[Army Recruit Training Centre|1st Recruit Training Battalion]] colour patch on his or her [[slouch hat]] and a small Recruit Instructor badge worn on the right breast pocket, if the position has been held long enough.

Members from all [[List of Australian Army Corps|Corps in the Army]] are eligible to become Recruit Instructors, including females. Experience as a Recruit Instructor is often a prerequisite to senior non-commissioned appointments in the military.

===Royal Australian Navy===
In the [[Royal Australian Navy]], there are Instructors at [[HMAS Cerberus (naval base)|HMAS Cerberus]], where the Recruit School course is held, and [[HMAS Creswell]], where the NEOC (New Entry Officer Course) is held, as well as at [[ADFA]].

Each division is made up of one of the following:
* Divisional Officer (a [[Lieutenant]])
* Divisional [[Chief Petty Officer]]
* Divisional [[Petty Officer]]
* Divisional Junior Sailor (a [[Leading Seaman]], who is the class instructor)
* Divisional [[Able Seaman]] (some large divisions may have a few Able Seaman serving as Assistant Instructors)

===Australian Federal Police===
In the [[Australian Federal Police]], Drill Instructors are trained and accredited by the Recognition and Ceremonial team.  Each accredited Drill Instructor wears an AFP pin with the wording "DI" positioned 5mm above their name plate or citations.  Drill Instructors are also issued with a black coloured Hellweg brand leather basket weave [[Sam Browne belt]] and strap.  The AFP is the only police agency to formally train and accredit police drill instructors in Australia, with a number of [[New South Wales Police Force]] members attached to the NSW Police College holding that qualification.

The Australian Federal Police College at Barton has a non-commissioned officer of sergeant rank holding the position of College Sergeant.  The College Sergeant carries a black [[pace stick]] as a badge of office at ceremonial functions and a swagger stick during normal duties.

===New South Wales Police Force===
The [[New South Wales Police Force]] has a Drill Sergeant and a Drill Constable attached to the NSW Police College at Goulburn.   Drill staff are responsible for training recruits in drill.  These personnel wear a blue [[Aiguillette|cord]] to signify being a protocol officer.  The Senior Protocol Officer (formally known as Protocol and Discipline Officer) which carries the rank of Senior Sergeant is responsible for the coordination of the final week of drill, known as Attestation Week and holds the position of Parade Sergeant at all Attestation Parades.  The Senior Protocol officer is responsible for dress, bearing and discipline and also is the guardian of NSWPF history, customs, traditions and symbols at the NSW Police College.  The Senior Protocol Officer carries a black pace stick with silver fittings and wears a black coloured Hellweg Brand Sam Browne belt with strap as a badge of office.

===Western Australia Police===
The Western Australian Police Force has a Drill Sergeant of the rank of sergeant who trains recruits in drill, discipline and other matters. He is also the recruit training manager responsible for overseeing the recruits training, ceremonial graduations, police funerals and other events. He meets regularly with academy executive and is responsible for removing recruits who fail parts of the course.  The sergeant carries a pace stick as a badge of office during parades.

==United Kingdom==

===British Army===
[[File:Drill Sergeant Shouting Orders MOD 45155579.jpg|thumb|right|A Drill Sergeant of the [[Scots Guards]] shouting orders to his troops]]
In the [[British Army]], the appointment of Drill Sergeant (DSgt) is limited to the five [[Foot Guards]] regiments, the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] (HAC), [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre]] [[Catterick Garrison|Catterick]], [[London District]], and the All-Arms Drill Wing (part of the Army School of Ceremonial, Catterick). Drill Sergeants hold the rank of [[Warrant Officer]] Class 2. However, any senior NCO conducting drill can be colloquially referred to as a "drill sergeant".

There are two Drill Sergeants per [[battalion]] (one in the HAC) and they have specific responsibilities for all duties, public or battalion (royal duties, barrack duties etc.). They support the [[Garrison Sergeant Major]] (GSM) or [[Regimental Sergeant Major]] (RSM) in the formation, practice and execution of these duties, typically running the duties roster, supervising rehearsals, and undertaking the guard mounts, both royal and barrack. They also deputise for the RSM in disciplinary matters.

The London District Drill Sergeant supports the GSM in the supervision of [[Trooping the Colour]], the [[State Opening of Parliament]], [[Beating the Retreat]] and any state visits. He also has responsibility under the GSM for the definition of British Army foot and arms drill.

They can be distinguished from other WO2s by their dress. They have the right to wear [[Sam Browne (belt)|Sam Browne belts]] when in No.2 dress and carry swords (never drawn) on ceremonial duties.

They are the third most senior Warrant Officers within a regimental structure, after the RSM and the [[Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant]] (RQMS). The HAC Drill Sergeant is thus the second most senior [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] soldier in the regiment.

==U.S. Armed Forces==
Drill instructors are held responsible for the welfare, behavior, and military education of the recruits assigned to them on a 24-hour basis throughout the period of initial training, of which the most well known is Basic Training or [[recruit training|boot camp]]. Their responsibilities include areas such as [[military discipline]], [[physical fitness]], and weapons training.  The title of Drill Instructor is a billet independent of rank, to be held by Non-Commissioned Officers who successfully complete the intense training program to earn that title.

The rank held by drill instructors varies by branch:
*''Drill Sergeants'' in the [[United States Army]] are Sergeants (E-5), [[Staff Sergeant]] (E-6), [[Sergeant First Class]] (E-7), and rarely First/Master Sergeants (E-8) .
*''Drill Instructors'' in the [[United States Marine Corps]] normally hold the rank of [[Sergeant]] (E-5) through [[Gunnery Sergeant]] (E-7).  A Corporal (E-4) is no longer authorized to attend Drill Instructor School therefore not authorized to hold the billet of a Drill Instructor. Successful completion of Drill Instructor School grants the Marine an additional MOS (Military Occupational Specialty) designation of 0911, Drill Instructor.
*''Recruit Division Commanders'' (formerly ''Company Commanders'') in the [[United States Navy]] are [[Petty Officer Second Class]] (E-5) through [[Master Chief Petty Officer]] (E-9).
*''Military Training Instructors'' in the [[United States Air Force]] are generally Staff Sergeants with 2 years time in grade(E-5) through [[Master Sergeant]]s (E-7).  
*''Company Commanders'' in the [[United States Coast Guard]] are [[Petty Officer Second Class]] (E-5) through [[Master Chief Petty Officer]] (E-9).

The arduous nature of drill instructor duty means that such assignments are among the most prestigious carried out by [[enlisted]] personnel. Those who become drill instructors are eligible for a variety of [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military awards]], such as the Marine [[Drill Instructor Ribbon]], and the Army's [[Drill Sergeant Identification Badge]].

===U.S. Marine Corps===
[[File:Senior drill instructor.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Marine Senior Drill Instructor supervises the inspection of his platoon]]
{{See also|United States Marine Corps Recruit Training}}

It may be taken offensively by U.S. Marine Corps Drill Instructors to be referred to as 'Drill Sergeants', which is strictly an Army term in the American military, just as Marines may take offense to being called "soldiers". This is considered to be a grievous insult if done intentionally. The only acceptable address of a drill instructor by a recruit is "sir", "ma'am" or "(senior) drill instructor (Rank) (last name)". At [[Officer Candidates School (U.S. Marine Corps)|Officer Candidates School]] (OCS), candidates are instructed by Drill Instructors who have already served a tour at one of the Recruit Depots. Officer candidates address their instructors as "Sergeant Instructor" (and rank and last name), or "Platoon Sergeant" (and rank and last name). The OCS Platoon sergeant is comparable to the Senior Drill Instructor in an enlisted recruit platoon. In the initial phase of training, officer candidates are trained in almost the same manner, and by the same people, as enlisted Marines, with slight differences reflecting the difference between the responsibilities the candidates will have as second lieutenants and those the recruits will have as junior Marines.

In addition, Drill Instructors at either E-6 or E-7 also train naval officer candidates at the Navy's Officer Candidate School at Officer Training Command Newport, Rhode Island, a holdover from the days when they trained prospective naval aviators at the former Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS) at Naval Aviation Schools Command, Pensacola, FL. Class Drill Instructors train officer candidates alongside Class Chief Petty Officers who have experience training Navy recruits as Recruit Division Commanders (RDCs). Unlike Marine Corps recruits, Navy officer candidates must address Drill Instructors by their rank, "Staff Sergeant" or "Gunnery Sergeant".

In the U.S. Marine Corps, candidates for Drill Instructor school are both volunteers and designates.  The Headquarters Marine Corps Special Duty Assignment Team creates a list known as the HSST List. This list has the names of Marines that have been slotted for the different B-Billets and Special Duty Assignments. Once a Marine's name comes up on this list, they must either serve the duty or prove that they are unfit for the assignment. The tour of duty is three years and demands the highest moral character and strength.  It is the job of the Drill Instructor to pass these characteristics on to the future of the Corps. This duty is referred to as "Making Marines", and is one of the most important duties of a Marine's career. A drill instructor is directly involved in shaping the future of the United States Marine Corps. Marines report to either Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island in South Carolina or to Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego in California, where they are assigned to Drill Instructor School. Upon graduation, they are assigned to one of the Recruit Training Battalions. Female Marines may now serve on both depots as Drill Instructors. Since spring 2016, Female Drill Instructors have begun serving in limited capacity on board Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego. This change took place in the Spring of 2016. Service as a Drill Instructor is considered a Special Duty Assignment in the Marine Corps (or "B" billet), which is factored into consideration of a Marine's eligibility for promotion. A Marine assigned to DI School must have at least a rank of Sergeant (E-5), or have been selected for promotion to Sergeant.

The school requires DI School students to complete every task recruits are required to do. The typical training day begins around 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. (0400 [[military time]]) and ends around 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. (1930), many times with specific training evaluations and end-of-day cleanups that require even longer days. At the end of each day, DI School students have to practice effective [[time management]] in studying for exams, practicing drill, rehearsing the teaching of drill movements verbatim and preparing uniforms all while still making time for intense physical training. The school lasts approximately three months with four classes running throughout the year.

Physical training or "PT" as a unit is conducted at least three times a week, with each session lasting approximately two hours. In addition to warming up, stretching, and calisthenics, students complete the "DI Playground" a [[Circuit training|circuit course]] that focuses on enhancing upper body strength. Physical training also prepares the future Drill Instructors for the Marine Corps Physical Fitness Test which consists of pull-ups, abdominal crunches, and a 3-mile timed run. Since a drill instructor is often required to spend 20 hours a day or more on his or her feet and to move fast at all times, various running sessions are conducted to enhance speed and endurance. Students are led by their squad instructors in ability group runs based on speed, gradually increasing distance and speed throughout the course. Track workouts, [[formation (military)|formation]] runs, and [[fartlek]] runs are also a staple of the training. Drill and discipline are crucial parts of the Drill Instructor School curriculum.

Every student is continuously evaluated, corrected, and mentored, with special attention paid to the smallest of details, such as the placement of a finger within 1/4 inch of its required location along a trouser seam, angle of the weapon, and positioning of the student in relation to the unit. Required knowledge is constantly taught and evaluated in the form of written exams, practical applications, and inspections. [[Military uniform|Uniforms]] are inspected continually, with surprise inspections conducted randomly in addition to the scheduled inspections. The drill instructor is expected to convey the best possible Marine Corps image to recruits and to America and to conduct his/herself to the highest Marine Corps leadership and integrity standards as well as to impart these standards to every recruit they train. Drill Instructors take a pledge which consists of the following words: "These recruits are entrusted to my care. I will train them to the best of my ability. I will develop them into smartly disciplined, physically fit, basically trained Marines, thoroughly indoctrinated in love of Corps and country. I will demand of them, and demonstrate by my own example, the highest standards of personal conduct, morality and professional skill."

[[File:Drill sergeant screams.jpg|thumb|upright|A USMC Drill Instructor]]
Upon completion of Drill Instructor School, Drill Instructors are assigned to Recruit Training Battalions as junior members ("fourth hats", "third hats", "kill hats", "bobby", or "bulldogs") of drill instructor teams. His or her job consists of constant corrections, dispensing punitive "Incentive Training" (IT), and keeping unremitting pressure on recruits to pay attention to details. He or she also teaches and reinforces academic knowledge to recruits. It is his or her duty to command the recruit platoon for initial drill evaluation, in which, in addition to the platoon receiving a score, the Drill Instructor is evaluated as well. These new drill instructors bear the burden of responsibility for breaking down a recruit's sense of self and selfishness, so that the more experienced drill instructors can focus the recruits on selflessness, obedience, and fraternity.

After completing a few 13-week cycles, the drill instructor is moved up to the position of ''Experienced Drill Instructor'' (EDI), also called the "heavy", "drill hat" or "J Hat".

The next step in a drill instructor career is becoming a ''Senior Drill Instructor''. Senior Drill Instructors hold a respected position which is distinguished by the wearing of a black sword belt (or Sam Browne Belt, but without the shoulder strap) instead of a green duty belt. A Senior Drill Instructor is ultimately accountable for the training of the [[platoon]] and for the efficiency of his or her assistant Drill Instructors. Although Senior Drill Instructors are NCOs (Sergeants) or Staff NCOs, their position in the recruit training platoon is similar to that of a [[commissioned officer]] Platoon Commander in a line platoon. As such, they are further set apart from "junior" Drill Instructors.

After completing a number of cycles, drill instructors are often assigned to Support Battalion duties outside of recruit-training platoons. Such assignments are referred to as quotas, and include jobs as academic instructors, administrative duties at Recruit Processing (Receiving Barracks, also known as Receiving Company at MCRD San Diego), [[martial arts]] instructors, Medical Rehabilitation Platoon (MRP), Physical Conditioning Platoon (PCP), Combat Water Survival Instructors, Field Training Instructors (a.k.a. Black Shirts) [MCRD Parris Island only], and Instructional Training Company Instructors (ITC DI) [MCRD San Diego only].

Some drill instructors choose to do a second tour of duty on the drill field. These volunteers still report to Drill Instructor School, but are referred to as course challengers, and are only required to complete a short refresher course. Multiple tour drill instructors, based on rank and experience, are usually assigned as Senior Drill Instructors, Series Chief Drill Instructors (MCRD San Diego) or Series Gunnery Sergeants (MCRD Parris Island), DI school instructors, Company First Sergeants, or Battalion Sergeants Major.

While in Drill Instructor status, both male and female DIs wear a [[World War I]] [[campaign hat]] with their service and utility uniforms.

For their successful service, Marine Drill Instructors are awarded the [[Drill Instructor Ribbon]]. This award is also given to other enlisted Marines and officers assigned to the recruit training environment, although these billets are recognized as being less directly involved in actually training recruits such as Series and Company Commander/ XO, Battalion Executive Officer, S-3, and Commander, and various levels of Sergeants Major at each Depot. At OCS, the ribbon is also given to Officer Candidate Company First Sergeants, Company Gunnery Sergeants, and Platoon Commanders.

===United States Army===
[[File:Drillsergeant.jpg|frame|upright=1.5|A Drill Sergeant drills recruits in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].]]
Historically, the task of the Drill Sergeant has been intrinsic to good order and discipline and commands respect throughout the Army.  Currently, soldiers of appropriate rank (usually [[Staff Sergeant]]s and [[Sergeant First Class|Sergeants First Class]] ) may volunteer or be centrally selected by U.S. Army Human Resources Command to attend Drill Sergeant School.  Those centrally selected are known as "DA Selected" meaning [[Department of the Army]] selected.  Drill Sergeant School is ten weeks long and consists of exactly the same activities as basic training; drill and ceremony, basic rifle marksmanship, obstacle/confidence courses, and field training exercises, training management, and leadership. Certain aspects of the [[Basic Leader Course]] are included.  Drill Sergeant candidates are held to the highest standards while going through the school as preparation for their tours of duty. The Drill Sergeant candidates are treated with a great deal of professionalism and not like recruits.  Upon graduation, male Drill Sergeants wear the [[World War I]] [[campaign hat]] (nicknamed the "Brown Round") and female Drill Sergeants wear the olive drab Australian bush cap.&lt;ref&gt;Army Regulation 670-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Army Drill Sergeant's normal tour of duty (called being "on the trail") is two years with a possible one-year extension.  Drill Sergeants may be assigned to units that conduct [[Basic Combat Training]] (BCT), reception, or [[OSUT|One-Station Unit Training]] (OSUT).  BCT Drill Sergeants train approximately 11 cycles during their two-year tours.  OSUT Drill Sergeants train recruits for an equivalent of BCT plus an additional number of weeks depending on the [[Military Occupational Specialty]], so their average number of cycles is less than that of a BCT Drill Sergeant. The breaks between cycles are extremely short, creating an incredibly demanding environment for Drill Sergeants.  It is not unusual for a cycle to graduate on a Thursday or Friday with new recruits arriving the following Monday or Tuesday.  Following several years of regular [[noncomissioned officer]]s filling platoon sergeant billets in [[Advanced Individual Training]], the Army announced in early April 2018, that Drill Sergeants will return to AIT training.

Senior Drill Sergeants are the most senior NCO in a given training platoon, and are ultimately responsible for Soldiers within or under their authority. The only NCO more senior to these individuals at the company level is the company's [[First Sergeant]], the senior enlisted leader and advisor to the company commander.

Successful completion of Drill Sergeant duty greatly enhances opportunities for promotion.  Many of the U.S. Army's most senior [[noncommissioned officer]]s are former Drill Sergeants.

The Army has had a difficult time recruiting Drill Sergeant volunteers due to recent changes in doctrine and policy, with a recent study by the Department of Defense noting that fewer than 30% of Drill Sergeant candidates are volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dod.mil/pubs/git/report.html |title=The Report of the Federal Advisory Committee on Gender-Integrated Training and Related Issues |publisher=Dod.mil |date= |accessdate=2016-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205129/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/git/report.html |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Past Drill Sergeants enjoyed much autonomy and latitude with which to train recruits and were reputed hands-on disciplinarians.  Currently, the Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) has sought to shift this authority away and has moved closer to what is known as "Schofield's Definition of Discipline."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130705211818/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/armys-new-drill-sergeants-teach-rather-yell ]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now a punishable offense to use demeaning or derogatory terms to refer to recruits or trainees, and terms such as "warrior" or "Soldier" are more preferable.  Additionally, it is a serious offense to punish recruits or trainees with "excessive" physical exercise, now known as [[hazing]].  Due to this, and also in part to the second and third order effects of this policy on the operational force, many NCOs feel disenchanted with the prospect of life on the trail and feel that their leadership abilities are better suited elsewhere.

The United States Drill Sergeant Academy is located in Fort Jackson, South Carolina. This is where all Drill Sergeants go to complete their drill sergeant training. The Academy is led by the Commandant and Deputy Commandant of the Drill Sergeant Academy. The instructors, known as Drill Sergeant Leaders (DSL's) are previously trained, and experienced Drill Sergeants. DSL's are selected very carefully by a panel of current senior Drill Sergeant Leaders, along with the leadership from the Academy. DSL's are held to the same high Army standards that new incoming Drill Sergeants are assessed on and must remain at those standards while instructing at the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Drill Sergeant Academy builds better prepared leaders {{!}} Article {{!}} The United States Army|url = http://www.army.mil/article/142601/|website = www.army.mil|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Navy===
[[File:Instructional Training exercises at RTC Great Lakes.jpg|250px|thumb|A Recruit Division Commander conducts "Instructional Training" to correct substandard performance during boot camp]]
In the [[United States Navy]], recruit training is conducted by Recruit Division Commanders (RDCs, formerly Company Commanders or CCs) at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes, located at Naval Station Great Lakes, in North Chicago, IL. RDCs are usually E-6 ([[Petty Officer First Class]]), but may be up to a Master Chief (E-9) and have at least six years time in service and above, who are volunteers that serve a three-year tour at RTC Great Lakes.

After submitting an approved package containing an endorsement from a commanding officer, prospective RDCs attend RDC "C" School located at RTC Great Lakes and are identified by the blue aiguillettes (ropes) they wear on the left shoulder of either their service, dress, or working uniforms. RDC School students typically spend thirteen weeks learning about the duties they will perform as RDCs, including drill and ceremony, classroom instruction, and uniform and compartment maintenance. They undergo routine uniform inspections, where RDC school staff (experienced RDCs) meticulously check for any deficiencies in a student's uniform. In addition, RDC School students spend three days a week undergoing physical training. Because of the intense workout periods, some RDC students find themselves unprepared; however, they must be ready to keep up with the recruits, some of them who are much younger or more athletic than they are. According to RDC "C" School staff, PT is the number one reason why some students drop out of the course.

Towards the end of RDC "C" School, RDC students shadow actual RDCs currently commanding a division. At the end of thirteen weeks, they receive their red ropes and badges which set them apart as RDCs. Following graduation and entering their first divisions, senior RDCs mentor these new junior RDCs, who then go on to gain experience with every new division (commonly referred to as a "push").

In the second year of their three-year tour, RDCs take a break from training divisions and perform other duties on base, including drill evaluations, practical training instruction, teaching classes at RDC "C" School, or Battle Stations 21.

RDC duty is considered a highly prestigious one as it is associated with higher levels of accession into the higher petty officer rates, including Chief Petty Officer. RDC duty also allows Sailors an opportunity to earn the Master Training Specialist designator. At the end of the three-year tour, eligible RDCs receive the Recruit Training Service Ribbon, along with a choice of coast for their next duty stations.

In addition to training recruits at RTC Great Lakes, RDCs at E-7 (Chief Petty Officer) or above who have experience leading recruit divisions train students at Officer Training Command in Newport, Rhode Island, either training prospective naval officers at Officer Candidate School (OCS) as Class Chief Petty Officers, alongside Marine Corps Drill Instructors, or newly commissioned junior officers in the Navy's Staff Corps (i.e. JAG, Medical Corps, Nurse Corps, etc.) at the Officer Development School (ODS).

===U.S. Air Force===
[[File:USAF female Drill Instructor.jpg|thumb|A Military Training Instructor at graduation parade at USAF basic training]]
{{See also|United States Air Force Basic Military Training}}
Air Force MTIs are non-commissioned officers ranging from Staff Sergeant (E-5) through Master Sergeant (E-7). They are trained at the Military Training Instructor School at Lackland AFB in San Antonio, Texas. Course length has changed several times during the last decade, but generally includes a period of assignment to a senior instructor to observe training (called "bird-dogging"). MTIs initially conduct basic training at Lackland Air Force Base as part of the 737th Training Group, but a select few conduct military training at the Officer Training School at Maxwell AFB and at the Air Force Academy during basic cadet training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PAK/is_5_57/ai_n15894847]&lt;/ref&gt;

MTIs are commonly identified by the AF blue campaign hat. Their usual duty uniform is the [[Airman Battle Uniform]] (ABU), with Blues uniforms worn during certain drill practices, and the graduation ceremony. In the case of ABUs, sage green boots are worn per Dress and Appearance regulations.  After completion of their MTI schooling, they are awarded the time-honored campaign hat. Upon receiving their certification as an instructor, they receive the Air Education and Training Command Instructor badge for wear on the right side of the blues uniform. The badge is not authorized for wear on the ABU. The MTI ribbon was awarded for completion of Instructor training until 4 September 2014. After this time, graduates will be awarded the Air Force Special Duty Ribbon, newly created and authorized on 1 Oct 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/afmedals/blafmti.htm |title=Air Force Decorations - Air Force Basic Military Training Instructor Ribbon |publisher=Usmilitary.about.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTIs usually begin their tours as "team members" - junior partners of a two-person team. Experienced MTIs becomes "team chiefs" and often work a basic training flight alone when manning shortages occur (especially during summer). MTIs refer to direct recruit training as being "on the street". At the conclusion of a tour, some MTIs are offered the chance to work in essential support training roles in the basic training course. This includes the combat training portions of the course, classroom academic instruction, and the "confidence" obstacle course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usafmtia.org/ |title=Home |publisher=Usafmtia.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTIs who are rated in the top 10% of their ranks are awarded with a blue "rope" replacing the black leather hat strap on the campaign or bush hat. These master military training instructors often evaluate the trainees and MTI ranks during parades and retreat ceremonies. Special trainers of MTIs used to wear a black "rope" and MTIs certified and assigned to train officer candidates wear a bright silver "rope".{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Unlike the Army, the Air Force uses a different specialist to continue military training during advanced individual or technical training. [[Military Training Leader|Military training leaders]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/afjobs/bl8b100.htm |title=Air Force Job Descriptions - AFSC 8B100 - MILITARY TRAINING LEADER |publisher=Usmilitary.about.com |date=2014-03-14 |accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (MTLs) wear a blue [[aiguillette]] on the left shoulder and act in the same capacity as Army drill sergeants during technical training. The aiguillette in various colors is worn by students to indicate leadership roles - green for student flight leaders, yellow for student squadron leaders, and red for squadron student commanders. A white aiguillette is worn by chapel guides, a white and blue rope denotes they are in the Drum and Bugle Corps, and a teal rope is worn by student counselors. At some technical training centers a black aiguillette is worn by members of student honor guards or drill teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/airforcejoin/a/techschoolrest.htm |title=Air Force Technical School Training Restrictions |publisher=Usmilitary.about.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Coast Guard===
[[File:249226.jpg|thumb|A Coast Guard Company Commander instructs recruits.]]
In the U.S. Coast Guard, Company Commanders are usually E-5 to E-8 and are special duty volunteers. Candidates attend Company Commander School in [[Cape May]], [[New Jersey]], which is collocated with recruit basic training. Upon completion, candidates then go in front of a board for final approval. Upon becoming a Company Commander (CC), the Coast Guardsman earns the right to wear the Company Commander Badge.

Coast Guard recruit companies average two or three CCs per, with the newer CCs serving as Assistants to the more experienced Lead CC.

During recent years, Coast Guard Company Commanders have gone to the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT to train outgoing third class cadets during a week-long evolution called "100th Week", in which they are once again treated as incoming fourth class cadets by the CCs. The rationale behind this is to remind these cadets of their experiences coming into the Academy, and to reinforce the mantra that they must do the things they will eventually demand of incoming plebes. Later in the week, CCs begin teaching the cadets lessons on leadership. The experience provides third class cadets with invaluable experience they will need in training the new incoming fourth class cadets during Plebe Summer.

===Drill Instructor's Creed===
In many military services, a Drill Instructors' creed has been created to succinctly state the beliefs that a Drill Instructor should follow.

====United States Army====
The Drill Sergeant Creed of the United States Army is:

:"I am a Drill Sergeant.
:I will assist each individual in their efforts to become a highly motivated, well disciplined, physically and mentally fit soldier, capable of defeating any enemy on today’s modern battlefield.
:I will instill pride in all I train. Pride in self, in the Army, and in Country.
:I will insist that each Soldier meets and maintains the Army standards of military bearing and courtesy, consistent with the highest traditions of the U.S. Army.
:I will lead by example, never requiring a Soldier to attempt any task I would not do myself.
:But first, last, and always, I am an American Soldier – Sworn to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, both foreign and domestic.
:I am a Drill Sergeant"&lt;ref&gt;United States Army. From [http://www.jackson.army.mil/DSS/creed.htm Fort Jackson Drill Instructor's School] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624200115/http://www.jackson.army.mil/DSS/creed.htm |date=June 24, 2007 }}, retrieved 19 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States Marine Corps====
The Drill Instructor Creed of the United States Marine Corps is:

:"These recruits are entrusted to my care.
:I will train them to the best of my ability.
:I will develop them into smartly disciplined, physically fit, basically trained Marines - thoroughly indoctrinated in love of the Corps and country.
:I will demand of them – while demonstrating by my own example – the highest standards of personal conduct, morality, and professional skill."&lt;ref&gt;United States Marine Corps.  From [http://www.marines.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/lookupstoryref/2005719345 DI School students take pledge to make Marines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930205628/http://www.marines.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/lookupstoryref/2005719345 |date=September 30, 2007 }}, July 1, 2005.  Retrieved 19 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States Air Force====
The Military Training Instructor Pledge:

:"The Military Training Instructor Hat that I wear
:Is a symbol of Honor, Professionalism, Integrity, Service, and Excellence in All I Do
:My job is one of the most important to the Air Force
:And I will spare no effort to properly prepare men and women for military service
:I am dedicated to the principles of fairness, firmness, and honesty
:I strive for perfection and reject mediocrity
:Both in my own personal behavior and in the performance of those I lead
:I am an Air Force Military Training Instructor
:And, above all I am an American Airman."

'''Earth’s Birthday Project''' is a U.S.-based 501(c)(3,&lt;ref&gt;Foundation Center. [http://dynamodata.fdncenter.org/990s/990search/esearch.php  “Foundation Center-990 Finder”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515091603/http://dynamodata.fdncenter.org/990s/990search/esearch.php |date=2009-05-15 }}, U.S.A. 1995-2010. Retrieved on 2010-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt; educational non-profit organization.

== History ==
Since Earth’s Birthday Project’s founding in 1989, it is estimated that more than 15 million school children have participated in butterfly and sunflower activities, as well as rainforest and river conservation.

In the late 1980s, as the twentieth anniversary of [[Earth Day]] approached, Cliff Ross was teaching middle school in [[New York City]]. Ross, his wife Lisa Werenko and his brother Tom Ross had just published their first environmental children’s book, ''It Zwibble, the Star-touched Dinosaur'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher = Scholastic|isbn = 978-0-590-40300-9|title = It Zwibble, the Star-Touched Dinosaur|url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7886691M/It_Zwibble_the_Star-Touched_Dinosaur|edition = original|publication-date = May 1988|id = 0590403001}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Scholastic. It seemed to them that Earth Day might be more effective if it could be a celebration; if it could become a day not only for activists but also for children. They thought, “Why not give the Earth a birthday party?”

They then invited children from across NYC to celebrate the first Earth’s Birthday on the Great Lawn of Central Park.&lt;ref&gt;Handschuh, David. "A social butterfly", ''[[New York Daily News]]'', New York, 18 April 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of teachers, donors and the Parks Commission, the children celebrated the 20th anniversary of Earth Day on April 20, 1990 and were joined by NYC Mayor Dinkins.&lt;ref&gt;Boez, Santiago. "The Earth Moves", ''[[New York Post]]'', New York, 21 April 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first year’s events “launched” the Earth’s Birthday Project as a nonprofit organization. Several components of the first celebration have become hallmarks of Earth’s Birthday Project’s educational activities through the years:
* '''Butterflies''' – With a donation from Carolina Biological Supply, cups of painted lady butterfly caterpillars were given to 4,000 Head Start classrooms. After observing the metamorphosis of caterpillars into butterflies,&lt;ref&gt;Science Netlinks. [http://www.sciencenetlinks.com/lessons.php?BenchmarkID=11&amp;DocID=6 ''Butterfly 1: Observing the Life Cycle of a Butterfly''], U.S.A. Retrieved on 2010-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt; the preschoolers released the butterflies on Earth Day.
* '''Sunflower seeds''' – children planted seeds in their classrooms and took the seedlings home to enjoy in pots or gardens until they bloomed.
* '''Rainforest conservation''' – Inspired by the Children's Rainforest&lt;ref&gt;Monteverde Info. [http://www.monteverdeinfo.com/monteverde-conservation-league/ ''Children's Eternal Rainforest''], Costa Rica 1998-2010. Retrieved on 2010-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt; in Costa Rica, initiated by students at Fagervick School in Sweden, Ross’s eighth-grade class at Packer Collegiate Institute enrolled children across NYC to collect pennies and purchase threatened rainforest land in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Rentas, David. "Small Change for Big Cause", ''[[New York Post]]'', New York, 6 April 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The children donated the funds to The Nature Conservancy, an international conservation organization.
 
Earth Birthday Project still puts butterflies into the hands of children, through programs in schools and individually to families.&lt;ref&gt;"Butterfly Release", ''[[Newsweek]]'', New York, 29 March 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piscotty, Marc. "Birthing butterflies", ''[[The Albuquerque Tribune]]'', Albuquerque, New Mexico, 2 July 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also promotes the teaching of environmental issues as part of school science curriculum.

== Butterflies and Sunflowers ==
Earth’s Birthday Project provides teachers with live butterflies, ladybugs and sunflower seeds to capture children’s imaginations and to engage them in close observation of living things. Through corporate sponsorship, like International Paper&lt;ref&gt;International Paper.

Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;Toyota USA Foundation. [http://www.toyota.com/about/philanthropy/education/toyota_usa/ ''Toyota USA Foundation'']. Retrieved on 2010-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Earth's Birthday Project provides hands-on materials to classrooms for free. In northern New Mexico, the NM Public Education Department has sponsored elementary science initiatives with Earth's Birthday Project.&lt;ref&gt;New Mexico Public Education Dept.

== Rainforest Conservation ==
Between 1989 and 2009, students participating in coin drives, bottle collections and other simple fundraising activities have raised $6.25 million to purchase and protect more than 400,000 acres of rainforest&lt;ref&gt;Earth's Birthday Project. [http://earthsbirthday.org/gifts/big-gift-history/ ''History of Big Gift Conservation''], U.S.A. 1998-2010. Retrieved on 2010-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and other endangered habitat in partnership with conservation organizations like The Nature Conservancy, Conservation International and Nature &amp; Culture International.

== Criticism ==
There is concern about the environmental impact of butterfly releases,&lt;ref&gt;Federman, Adam. [http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/all_aflutter/ ''All Aflutter: The Flap Over the Mail Order Butterfly Industry''], Earth Island Journal,  Autumn 2008: Vol. 23, no. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular the release of monarch butterflies at weddings. Underlying the arguments against butterfly releases is the idea that companies should not raise butterflies for any commercial purposes, including science education, butterfly pavilions, weddings and celebrations; butterflies should only be experienced in nature. Arguments include the potential spread of disease into wild populations, influence on the gene pool, introduction of species outside of their native range and cruelty to captive insects. Whether these concerns are overstated or if they need serious study is unclear. Concerning Earth’s Birthday Project specifically, the organization supplies painted lady butterfly caterpillars, which are native throughout North America, for educational purposes only. Observing the metamorphosis of a butterfly in approx. 21 days teaches children about insect life cycles which is included in the required curricula of many states. Butterfly releases by a classroom are small, 3-5 butterflies; if several classrooms participate, there may be 20-30 butterflies. In addition teachers and parents report that raising butterflies introduces children to caring for the natural world and leads easily to improving wildlife habitat at school and in the local community.

==Partners==
Partners of the organization include [[World Land Trust]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], and [[African Wildlife Foundation]].

{{Nihongo|'''Freeter'''|フリーター|furītā}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] expression for people who lack full-time employment or are unemployed, excluding [[Housewife| housewives]] and students. The term originally included young people who deliberately chose not to become [[Salaryman |salary-men]], even though jobs were available at the time.

Freeters may also be described as ''[[underemployment |underemployed]]''. These people do not start a career after high school or university, but instead earn money from low-skilled and low-paid jobs.

The word ''freeter'' or ''freeta'' was first used around 1987 or 1988 and is thought to be a  [[portmanteau]] of the [[English language| English]] word ''free'' (or perhaps ''freelance'') and the [[German language|German]] word ''Arbeiter'' ("labourer"). ''Arubaito'' is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[gairaigo| loanword]] from ''Arbeiter'', and perhaps from ''Arbeit'' ("work"). As German (along with English) was used in Japanese universities before [[World War II]], especially for science and medicine, ''arubaito'' became common among students to describe part-time work for university students.

==History==
About 10% of high school and university graduates could not find steady employment in the spring of 2000, and a full 50% of those who could find a job left within three years after employment. The employment situation is worse for the youngest freeters.

From 2000–2009, the number of freeters increased rapidly. In 1982 there were an estimated 0.5 million freeters in Japan, 0.8 million in 1987, 1.01 million in 1992 and 1.5 million in 1997. The number for 2001 is 4.17 million freeters according to one estimate, and 2 million in 2002 according to another estimate. According to some estimates, there will be 10 million freeters in Japan by 2014.  

Many Japanese people worry about the future impact of freeters on society. If they work at all, freeters often work at convenience stores, supermarkets, fast food outlets, restaurants, and other low paying, low skill jobs. According to a survey by the Japan Institute of Labor in 2000, the average freeter works 4.9 days per week and earns [[yen|¥]]139,000 per month (ca. $1,300 U.S.). Two thirds of freeters have never had a regular, full-time job.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The rise of internet business has allowed some freeters to work from home and be self-employed. Some experts predict that [[Aging of Japan|Japan's aging population]] will create a labor shortage that will increase career options for freeters.

==Causes==
The Japan Institute of Labor classifies freeters into three groups: the "''moratorium'' type" that wants to wait before starting a career, the "''dream pursuing'' type", and the "''no alternative'' type". 
*The ''moratorium'' type of freeter wants to enjoy life, and deliberately chooses not to join the [[rat race]] of the [[Japanese work environment]].
*The ''dream pursuing'' type has specific dreams incompatible with a standard Japanese career.
*The ''no alternative'' type could not find a decent job before high school or university graduation in the system called {{nihongo|"[[simultaneous recruiting of new graduates]]" |新卒一括採用|Shinsotsu-Ikkatsu-Saiyō}}, which is unique to Japanese society.  Those left behind by ''Shinsotsu-Ikkatsu-Saiyō'' are forced to take low paying irregular jobs. This usually has to do with their [[Dropping out|dropout]] status from previous educational institutes. Those who dropped out of high school have the worst prospects.

==Effects==

===Difficulties starting their own household===
Many freeters live for free with their parents as [[parasite singles]]. Parents in Japan usually do not force their offspring out of the house. Once the parents die, the children will have to pay for their housing themselves. Even if they inherit the house or apartment, they still have to bear the costs of ownership.

[[Housing in Japan|Japanese housing]] is compact, and is too small for two families. If freeters want to marry they have to find their own housing, usually at their own expense. 

===Difficulties starting a career===
Starting a career becomes more difficult the longer somebody is a freeter, as Japanese companies prefer to hire new workers fresh out of high school or university. While the employment situation is changing, large traditional companies still see a new employee as a lifetime investment.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} They much prefer to hire a young person who offers a longer period of service, and who will be easier to mold.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Often the only option left for freeters is to continue working at low income part-time jobs, making it difficult to establish their own household. Some join the many [[Homelessness|homeless]] in Japan.

===Health and pension insurance===
Part-time jobs usually do not include any health or retirement benefits. Freeters' low income makes payment of [[medical expenses]] onerous.

The biggest problem for freeters is that the Japanese pension system is based on the number of years a person has paid into the system. The freeter usually has little or no pension insurance or savings, which may force him or her to work beyond the usual retirement age. 

Japan faces the problem of an aging population. The pension system will be under increasing strain as the ratio of pensioners to workers increases.

===Freedom of choice===
The advantage of being a freeter is that one has more freedom of choice, and more time for hobbies, volunteering, and community service. If they are living with their parents, they can spend their entire income on themselves.

===Effect on Japanese society===
Freeters lack the benefits of union membership, which would give them some legal protection against firing.

While they are young, freeters commonly live with their parents and have [[disposable income]] that would otherwise go towards rent. Their spending helps the manufacturing sector of the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]].

By living in the same house as their parents and often not owning a car, freeters have a much lower impact on the natural environment than "high consumption" members of society owning cars.

Large numbers of workers trying to start careers in their thirties may have a significant impact on the current corporate culture of Japan. It may change hiring and employment practices, particularly since demographers predict a future labor shortage due to the nation's aging population.

Many male freeters have difficulties marrying because of their low income. They may thus have children later in life, or not at all. This will further inflame the low birth rate in Japan and compound social and economic problems related to the aging population, such as underfunding of the [[National Pension (Japan)|Japanese pension system]]. As of today, freeters pay little or no money into the pension system. The situation could become even worse in the future as more people become freeters, the ratio of workers to pensioners decreases, and the current pension policies around the world stay the same.

The Japanese government has established a number of offices called ''Young Support Plaza'' to help young people find jobs. These offices offer basic training for job hunting: teaching young people how to write a [[résumé]], and how to conduct themselves during interviews. The demand for their services has been fairly low so far.

'''Friends of Mongolia''' ('''FOM''') is a US-registered, [[501(c)(3)]] [[tax-exempt]] [[non-profit organization]] registered in Mongolia and the United States. Friends of Mongolia is organized and operated exclusively for charitable, educational, and developmental purposes. Friends of Mongolia exists to develop partnerships with the people of Mongolia in furtherance of cultural exchange and human development.  It is affiliated with the [[National Peace Corps Association]], but membership is open to anyone with an interest in Mongolia.

==History==
Friends of Mongolia was established in 1999 by returned [[Peace Corps]] volunteers who had served in Mongolia.

==Governance==
Friends of Mongolia's operations are overseen by a board of directors who are elected for three year terms and managed by officers (two Co-coordinators, Treasurer, Communications Coordinator, and Membership Coordinator) who are elected annually. A Mongolia Country Representative and Deputy Country Representative are appointed by the board to oversee activities in Mongolia.

==Programs==
===FOM Scholarship Program===
The FOM Scholarship was established in 2006, with the aim of assisting young male students from rural communities with high academic potential and financial need to attend post-secondary institutions across Mongolia. The program specifically stipulated that all applicants be male and living outside of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital city. The reason for this unique requirement was what is referred to as "Mongolia's reverse gender gap." Often rural males are left behind in education because of social and economic demands in the countryside. In fact, according to the National Statistics on Gender in Mongolia, in 2005 only 39% of students enrolled in institutions of higher education were male.&lt;ref&gt;National Statistics on Gender in Mongolia,2005&lt;/ref&gt; Successful applicants were awarded one-year full tuition scholarships.

===Matthew Girvin Scholarship Fund===
In 2006 FOM began working with Inland Northwest Community Foundation, [[UNICEF]] and the Mongolian Youth Development Foundation (MYDF) to help facilitate the distribution of the Matthew Girvin Scholarship Fund. This fund 'was created in memory of Matthew Girvin, a UNICEF program officer stationed in Mongolia who was killed in a helicopter crash in January 2001, to support highly qualified secondary school graduates from low-income families in the rural areas of Mongolia to study at some of the best state institutions of higher learning within Mongolia.

===FOM Grant Program===
The Friends of Mongolia Community Development Grant program is inspired by the Small Project Assistance (SPA) grant familiar to all PCVs, and provides financing for small community-based projects in Mongolia and the United States that further education, cultural exchange, and community development between both countries. Community projects generally do not attract the kind of funding on offer from large multi-lateral or bi-lateral donors, and modest community-based programs struggle to find appropriate funding to support their program goals. The FOM Community Development Grant program is intended to address these issues. FOM Community Development Grants can be as little as a few hundred dollars and do not generally exceed $2,500. 

FOM Community Development Grants are community initiated and implemented. Each proposal should demonstrate community-based support for a project through a minimum 25% local in-kind contribution of labor and materials in the overall budget of the project.  

Proposals are accepted on a rolling basis, and each proposal is reviewed by a committee made up of FOM Members using a standard scoring method. Final funding approval for proposals is made based on review committee recommendations and the availability of funds.

==Logo==
The Friends of Mongolia logo depicts a Mongolian ''ger'' or [[yurt]] accompanied by traditional Mongolian script which spells 'Friend'.

[[File:Logo idheap.gif|thumb|Former logo of the IDHEAP.]]

The '''Swiss Graduate School of Public Administration''' (French: ''Institut des hautes études en administration publique'', '''IDHEAP''') is a [[Swiss]] [[graduate school]] of [[public administration]]. In 2014, the independent foundation was integrated into the [[University of Lausanne]].&lt;ref name="unil.ch"&gt;[http://www.unil.ch/webdav/site/central/shared/docs/rapport_12.pdf Rapport annuel 2012 de l'Université de Lausanne], www.unil.ch (page visited on 30 May 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The school teaches graduate and post-graduate courses for [[public sector]] executives and (more recently) students wishing to take up public service. It also provides [[professional training]] for members of administrative bodies. It receives support from the [[Swiss Confederation]] under the Swiss Federal Law on University Funding. IDHEAP is located on the campus of the [[University of Lausanne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} http://www.unil.ch/acces/page36671_fr.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} http://www.idheap.ch/idheap.nsf/vwBaseDocuments/IdActQ03?OpenDocument&amp;lng=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond its teaching activities, IDHEAP also carries out research and counselling missions regarding the public sector. IDHEAP has been designated as the leading institution of the Swiss Public Administration Network,&lt;ref name="pnap.ch"&gt;http://www.pnap.ch/index.php?id=4  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225073006/http://www.pnap.ch/index.php?id=4 |date=February 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to foster cooperation between the universities of [[University of Bern|Bern]], [[University of Lausanne|Lausanne]] and [[University of Lugano|Lugano]], to boost research works and doctoral studies in [[public administration]].

== History ==
IDHEAP was created (under the form of a “Foundation for a graduate school in public administration”) by Enrico Bignami, former delegate of the Board of Directors of [[Nestlé]] and creator of IMEDE (now the [[International Institute for Management Development]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imd.ch/index.cfm?bhcp=1 IMD business school, Switzerland]&lt;/ref&gt; who wished to establish a Swiss [[MBA]] for the public sector. The other founders were the canton of [[Vaud]], the [[University of Lausanne]], the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] and the Association of Friends of IDHEAP.

=== Master of Public Administration (MPA) programme ===
The [[Master of Public Administration|MPA]] program&lt;ref name="idheapmpa"/&gt; is a 90 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] executive, flexible length and multidisciplinary program ([[Master of Advanced Studies]]), designed for public sector managers or would-be managers. It is also open to anyone wishing to pursue a career in an organization whose activities involve working with the public sector.

The curriculum includes a foundation course (6 core modules of 6 days –one day a week during the academic year), 3 course options of 12 days, chosen among a list of 18 elective courses and an approximately 100 pages thesis covering an original and in-depth research project carried out from an interdisciplinary perspective and supervised by a professor at IDHEAP and an external expert.

Teaching includes group works (both presential and online), simulations, [[case studies]] (which may require students to work on real mandates and counselling missions carried out by the Institute) and research works.

The IDHEAP courses are delivered in French (although an international Executive MPA will soon be offered in English). The two other working languages are [[German language|German]] and English. Both a student's trimester’s work and the dissertation can be written in French, German, English or [[Italian language|Italian]].

The average age of a graduate is 37, with a 66/34 split of men/women. 80 percent of graduates already have a university degree, most of them in political sciences, arts, economics, and law.

== Research ==
The IDHEAP teaching and research units participate in research projects financed by the [[Swiss National Science Foundation]] and [[R&amp;D]] financed by the Commission for Technology and Innovation or the [[European Union]] four-year Information Society Technologies framework programs. Some research receives support from programs such as the Swiss Virtual Campus, the [[Interreg]] fund (European Cross-border Cooperation) or [[COST – European Cooperation in the Field of Scientific and Technical Research]]. Part of the research work carried out at IDHEAP is financed by consulting or experts’ fees.

33 research projects are currently under way at the school. Recent examples include:
* BADAC (http://www.badac.ch/), a Database of the Swiss States and Cities, funded by the Conference of Cantonal Chancellors
* Conditions for a joint representation of the scope for public action on a local level, funded by the [[Swiss National Science Foundation]]
* eGOV (integrated platform for an online, one-stop government), 5th IST (Information Society Technologies) framework program, for the European Union
* Modelling transport in Switzerland, for the [[Swiss Federal Statistical Office]]
* MOTOWN – Workey (a [[workflow]] designer and builder), for the Commission for Technology and Innovation
* Income and public spending and its impact on budgetary balance and econometric modelling, funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation
* Institutional regimes for urban resources, IRIS project (integration, regulation and social innovations) for the Lake Geneva triangle
* Sports Organisation Management Interactive Teaching (or [http://www.somit.ch/ SOMIT]), funded by Swiss virtual campus
* Actors’ strategies regarding ongoing training, funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (National Research Project 43)
* The Swiss Decision Making System in the Era of [[Globalization]], for the Swiss National Science Foundation (Priority Program “Switzerland Tomorrow”).

IDHEAP publishes a full list of research projects on its website, at http://www.idheap.ch/idheap.nsf/vwBaseDocuments/IdREx01?OpenDocument&amp;lng=en.

Five new research projects were awarded to IDHEAP in 2007 by the Swiss National Fund for Research. In 2007, three doctorates of Public Administration were awarded by the University of Lausanne on the recommendation of IDHEAP.

Also in 2007, the university's Prof. Giuliano Bonoli was awarded the Latsis prize&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.snf.ch/F/NewsPool/Pages/mm_07oct09.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707003609/http://www.snf.ch/F/NewsPool/Pages/mm_07oct09.aspx |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Swiss National Research Fund for his [[comparative research]] works on [[Social policy|social policies]].

'''''{{lang|de|Kleine Schriften}}''''' is a [[German language|German]] phrase ("short writings" or "minor works"; {{lang-la|Opuscula}}) often used as a title for a collection of [[Article (publishing)|articles]] and [[essay]]s written by a single [[scholarly method|scholar]] over the course of a career. "Collected Papers" is an English equivalent. These shorter works were usually published previously in various [[Periodical publication|periodicals]] or in collections of papers (such as a ''{{lang|de|[[Festschrift]]}}'') written by multiple scholars. A scholar's ''Kleine Schriften'' may be contained in a single [[volume (bibliography)|volume]], or several volumes published at once or (more commonly) in [[Book series|series]] within a period of a few years. Multi-volume collections may contain a scholar's minor or lesser-known book-length works as well.

The title is usually reserved for the collected works of a scholar who wrote primarily in German or whose first language was German. The collection of a scholar who worked or taught internationally will often contain essays in more than one language; the multi-volume ''{{lang|de|Kleine Schriften}}'' of [[Walter Burkert]], for instance, includes work in German, [[English language|English]], and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Kleine Schriften'' (Göttingen 2001, multi-volume series in continuing publication).&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[expatriate]]s, articles in the host language may outnumber those in German. This is particularly true of German [[philology|philologists]] who [[Emigration|emigrated]] in the 1930s, many of whom published much of their research in English or French; [[Friedrich Solmsen]]'s three-volume ''Kleine Schriften'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Solmsen]], ''Kleine Schriften'', 3 vols. (Hildesheim 1968–1982).&lt;/ref&gt; in which English articles outnumber German, is an example.

''{{lang|de|Kleine Schriften}}'' may also appear as an explanatory subtitle; for example, ''{{lang|de|Gotica: kleine Schriften zur gotischen Philologie}}'',  a collection of papers on the extinct [[Gothic language]] by Ernst A. Ebbinghaus.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst A. Ebbinghaus, ''Gotica: kleine Schriften zur gotischen Philologie'', edited by Piergiuseppe Scardigli and [[Wolfgang Meid]] (Innsbrück: Institut für Sprachen und Literaturen der Universität Innsbrück, 2003). {{ISBN|3851246896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''State achievement tests in the United States''' are [[standardized test]]s required in American [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] in order for the schools to receive federal funding, according to the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]] of 1965, in [[List of United States federal legislation|US Public Law]] 107-110, and the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001.

== Tests by state ==
The following [[standardized test]]s are designed and/or administered by [[State education agency|state education agencies]] and/or local [[school district]]s in order to measure [[academic achievement]] across multiple grade levels in [[elementary school|elementary]], [[middle school|middle]] and [[senior high school]], as well as for [[high school graduation examination]]s to measure proficiency for [[high school]] graduation. [[Nebraska]] is the only state that does not have a standardized test.

==Additional tests==
In addition to the following list some states administer other required examinations. They include Nevada, which administers several tests as part of the [[Nevada Proficiency Examination Program]]. They include the [[High School Proficiency Examination]] for Reading and Mathematics; the [[Iowa Test of Basic Skills]]; [[Iowa Tests of Educational Development]]; [[Criterion-referenced test]]s in Reading, Mathematics, and Science; [[Language Proficiency Assessment]]; [[Nevada Alternate Scales of Academic Achievement]]; and [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]]. The [[Prairie State Achievement Exam]] is used in [[Illinois]], along with the &lt;ref name="ISAT"/&gt; Illinois State Achievement Test. Alabama requires the [[Stanford Achievement Test Series]]; and in Texas, the [[Texas Higher Education Assessment]]. That state has discontinued its usage of the [[Texas Assessment of Academic Skills]]. Since the 2007–08 school year, Kentucky has required that all students at public high schools take the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] in their junior year.

== History ==
{{Historical populations|2008|254|||||||||2013|1,430||||||title=Enrollment by year}}
Lúrio University was established by decree No. 50/2006 of the [[Council of Ministers (Mozambique)|Council of Ministers]] on 26 December 2006, published in the ''[[Boletim da República]]'', and officially inaugurated on 29 June 2007 by [[President of Mozambique|President]] [[Armando Guebuza]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://clubofmozambique.com/business-directory/lurio-university/|title=Lúrio University|work=Mozambique|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minister of Education (Mozambique)|Education Minister]] [[Aires Ali]], among others, attended the inauguration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2007, the university rectory was organized in [[Nampula]], at first occupying facilities provided by the [[Museum of Ethnology of Mozambique]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This made it the first public university in the country headquartered outside of the capital, [[Maputo]]. On 21 August 2007 the university council held its first session, defining its vision, mission, structure, and a suitable acronym. The Latin ''Scientia, Cretum, Fides'' ("Science, Development, Commitment") was chosen as the motto, and UniLúrio was selected as an acronym. The university logo was also chosen, selected from various designs put forward through a contest promoted by [[Eduardo Mondlane University]]'s Faculty of Architecture and Physical Planning.

The university opened the Faculty of Health Sciences to students in 2007.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The university started out with 20 instructors, 254 students,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sarua.org/?q=uni_Universidade%20L%C3%BArio|title=Universidade Lúrio {{!}} SARUA|website=www.sarua.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three courses, medicine, dental medicine, and pharmacy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From the start, the university planned to eventually expand to three campuses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These goals came to fruition in 2008 and 2009, when satellite campuses were opened in [[Pemba, Mozambique|Pemba]], [[Cabo Delgado Province]] and [[Sanga, Mozambique|Sanga]], [[Niassa Province]], respectively.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unilurio.ac.mz/unilurio/index.php/sobre-a-unilurio/historial-missao-e-visao|title=Historial, Missão e Visão|last=WebMaster|website=www.unilurio.ac.mz|language=pt-PT|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pemba campus opened in temporary quarters in August 2008, and later moved onto a 12-hectare permanent campus.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At the Pemba campus' opening, the Minister of Education said that Lúrio University "has positively surprised us, because without much uproar it is producing results."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

By 2013, the university had 192 professors and 1,430 students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That year, the university reported it was planning to construct a 70-bed [[teaching hospital]], and potentially an eye-hospital with [[India|Indian]] assistance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At that point, the university was using the [[Central Hospital of Nampula]] as its training hospital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the rectorship of [[Jorge Ferrão]], the university acquired significant debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.verdade.co.mz/opiniao/editorial/60235-verdade-editorial-o-pecado-do-ferrao-|title=Editorial truth: The sin of the Ferrão|last=|first=|date=2016-11-25|work=@Verdade|access-date=2017-12-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Malaysian Qualifications Agency''' (Agensi Kelayakan Malaysia) or the '''MQA''' is a statutory body in [[Malaysia]] set up under the Malaysian Qualifications Act 2007 to accredit academic programs provided by educational institutions providing post secondary or [[higher education]] and facilitate the accreditation and articulation of qualifications.

==Role==
The main role of the MQA is to implement the [[Malaysian Qualifications Framework]] (MQF) as a basis for quality assurance of higher education and as the reference point for the criteria and standards for national qualifications. Specifically, the functions of the MQA are:&lt;ref&gt;Malaysian Qualifications Agency: [http://www.lan.gov.my/eng/introduction.cfm MQA In Brief]&lt;/ref&gt;
* To implement MQF as a reference point for Malaysian qualifications
* To develop standards and credits and all other relevant instruments as national references for the conferment of awards with the co-operation of stakeholders
* To quality assure higher education institutions and programmes
* To accredit courses that fulfil the set criteria and standards
* To facilitate the recognition and articulation of qualifications
* To maintain the Malaysian Qualifications Register (MQR)

The MQA also evaluates foreign qualifications and assesses it for equivalency with Malaysian secondary school and university preparatory qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;Malaysian Qualifications Agency: [http://www.lan.gov.my/senarainilaitaraf.cfm Nilai Taraf Kelayakan Akademik Luar Negara yang Setara dengan SPM/STPM] (in Malay)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exemptions==
The Education Act 1996 specifically excludes from its definition of educational institutions, schools or any other institutions where the teaching is confined exclusively to the teaching of any religion or any place declared by the Minister by notification in the Gazette not to be an educational institution.&lt;ref&gt;Education Act 1996: [http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%2011/Act%20550.pdf Article 2 of the Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029023543/http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%2011/Act%20550.pdf |date=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for schools that provide religious instruction exclusively (like [[seminaries]]) to be exempt from the jurisdiction of the MQA.

==History==
Under Malaysian law, all institutions of higher education established by the federal government are deemed to be self-accrediting whereas no formal accreditation system for courses of study provided by privately owned (including those owned by state governments) existed until the passing of the series of education-related legislation in 1996.

===The situation before 1996===
The first university in Malaysia, the [[University of Malaya]] (UM), was a result of the union between the older King Edward VII College of Medicine (established in 1905) and Raffles College (established in 1928) with the passage of the University of Malaya Ordinance 1949. The ordinance empowered UM to confer diplomas and degrees in its own name, making it [[de jure]] self-accrediting institution. With the 1961 separation of the [[Kuala Lumpur]] campus and [[Singapore]] campus of UM into the University of Malaya and the [[University of Singapore]] respectively, the University of Malaya Act 1961 and the Degrees and Diplomas Acts 1962 re-affirmed the authority granted to under previous legislations to the newly re-organised UM.

With the passage of the Universities and University Colleges Act 1971 (UUCA), all universities and university colleges established by the federal government of Malaysia were granted the power to confer diplomas and degrees in their own name. [[Universiti Teknologi Mara]] was established by the Universiti Teknologi Mara Act 1976 granting it the same powers as other institutions established under the UUCA but allowing it to restrict its enrolment of non-[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and non-[[Bumiputra]] students by virtue of [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;Universiti Teknologi Mara Act 1976: [http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%204/Act%20173.pdf Article 1A and 3A of the Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Registration of Schools Ordinance 1950 provided for the registration of privately owned educational institutions providing post secondary or higher education. Subsequent legislation such as the Education Ordinance 1957, the Education Act 1961, the Essential (Higher Educational Institutions) Regulations 1969, the Education (Amendment) Act 1963, and the Education Act 1996, continued to provide the legal basis for the registration of private institutions of higher education but continued to grant the power to approve courses of study by the Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Education Act 1996 [http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%2011/Act%20550.pdf Refer to Article 77 of the Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029023543/http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%2011/Act%20550.pdf |date=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, the passage of the National Council of Higher Education Act 1996 gave indications that an overhaul of the regulations governing private institutions of higher education was being planned. The subsequent passages of the Private Higher Educational Institutes Act 1996 and the Lembaga Akreditasi Negara Act 1996 later the same year saw the revamping of the registration and approval regime of private institutions of higher education.

===Reform and consolidation===
A statutory body known as Lembaga Akreditasi Negara ({{lang-en|National Accreditation Board}}) or LAN was established under the Lembaga Akreditasi Negara Act 1996 to accredit certificate, diploma and degree programs provided by private institutions of higher education. In April 2002, a Quality Assurance Division (QAD) was established by the [[Ministry of Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Education]] (MOE) to manage and co-ordinate the quality assurance system in public institutions of higher learning.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Higher Education: [http://apps.emoe.gov.my/qad/about.html Quality Assurance Division - About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607033909/http://apps.emoe.gov.my/qad/about.html |date=7 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A national consultation seminar was convened in 2003 to streamline and provide for a unified system of qualifications offered by all institutions of higher education in Malaysia;&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Higher Education: [http://apps.emoe.gov.my/qad/nqf/PP.doc Quality Assurance Division - Position Paper for a National Qualifications Framework] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220033812/http://apps.emoe.gov.my/qad/nqf/PP.doc |date=20 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this eventually saw the adoption of the [[Malaysian Qualifications Framework]] (MQF) in 2007.

===Establishment of the MQF===
On 1 November 2007, the QAD and LAN were dissolved and their functions taken over by the MQA which was established under the Malaysian Qualifications Agency Act 2007.

'''Marian Garfinkel''' (born April 2, 1932) is an early researcher in the field of complementary medicine, showing that yoga could be used to treat and possibly cure a variety of hand injuries resulting from repetitive use. She studied with [[B. K. S. Iyengar]] for over 40 years, making annual trips to yoga centers in India, France, California and Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;The Power of Yoga, Richard Corliss, Time, April 15, 2001. http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,106356-3,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of her contact with Iyengar, she and her former husband [[Marvin Garfinkel]] is credited with inspiring the sculptor [[Robert Engman]] to create the sculpture [[After B. K. S. Iyengar (Engman)|After Iyengar]], currently on display at the [[Morris Arboretum]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref&gt;After B. K. S. Iyengar, http://www.morrisarboretum.org/sculptures_afterbks.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC. 

==Life==
Garfinkel grew up in Altoona, Pennsylvania, the youngest of four children.&lt;ref&gt;What Price Success: One man's 34 year search for his GI father, Norman Spencer, Mereo Books, Gloucestershire, UK. p. 258. https://books.google.com/books?id=JLJqCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA258&amp;ots=eKwYp1UZNK&amp;dq=%22marian%20garfinkel%22%20altoona%20pennsylvania&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage&amp;q=%22marian%20garfinkel%22%20altoona%20pennsylvania&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; She married [[Marvin Garfinkel]] in 1962, and settled at [[Cobble Court]] in 1974.

Following the award of her degree, Dr. Garfinkel assumed teaching positions at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Temple University]].
In 2016, Garfinkel's extensive archives regarding B. K. S. Iyengar were donated to the Iyengar Yoga National Association of the United States (IYANUS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iynaus.org/ |title=Home &amp;#124; Iyengar Yoga: National Association of the United States |publisher=Iynaus.org |date= |accessdate=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garfinkel is a senior certified Iyengar teacher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bys-yoga.com/instructors/|title=» Instructors|website=www.bys-yoga.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yoga-taller/yoga-helps-older-women-balance-and-stand-taller-idUSHAR06825420080410|title=Yoga helps older women balance and stand taller|first=Anne|last=Harding|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was a student of [[B. K. S. Iyengar]] between 1976, when she first met him in Ann Arbor, MI, and his death in 2014.

==Research==
In 1994 Garfinkel was the lead author of a study that showed that yoga could be used for treatment of osteoarthritis of the hands,&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel MS, Schumacher HR, Husain A, Levy M, Reshetar RA. Evaluation of a yoga based regimen for treatment of osteoarthritis of the hands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5372">'''Mary Jarred''' (9 October 1899{{spaced ndash}}12 December 1993) was an [[English people|English]] [[opera singer]] of the mid-twentieth century.  She is sometimes classed as a [[mezzo-soprano]] and sometimes as a [[Alto|contralto]].

==Biography==
Jarred was born in [[Brotton]], [[Yorkshire]], (now in [[Redcar and Cleveland]]), and studied at the [[Royal College of Music]].
 
===Opera===
Jarred began her career singing minor roles at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] beginning in 1929. On the recommendation of [[Lauritz Melchior]], she was invited to the [[Hamburg State Opera]] and remained there as a guest artist for the following three years. Her roles included the Nurse in [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' and several in contemporary works by [[Hans Pfitzner]] and [[Alban Berg]].&lt;ref name=timesobit&gt;''The Times'' (obituary), 16 December 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1933, she sang Orpheus in [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'s ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orpheus and Eurydice]]'' for [[Sadler's Wells Opera]].&lt;ref name=indie&gt;''The Independent'' (obituary), 14 January 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

At Covent Garden she sang every year from 1933 until 1939, when the theatre closed at the outbreak of war. She sang Erda in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' and ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]'', and Fricka in ''[[Die Walküre]]''.&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; In 1934, she sang Margret in the first British broadcast performance of [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Wozzeck]]'' for the [[BBC]], conducted by [[Adrian Boult]].&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt;  During and immediately after the Second World War, Jarred performed in recitals and concerts. She returned to opera in 1953, as the brothel keeper in the British stage première of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rake's Progress]]''.&lt;ref name=indie/&gt;

===Concerts and later years===
In concert, she was famed as [[contralto]] soloist in [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s ''[[St Matthew Passion]],'' [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s ''[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]'' and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Choral Symphony]]. She was also a well-known Angel in [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s ''[[The Dream of Gerontius]]''. ''The Times'' commented: "In all these parts her commitment, sincerity and warmth of personality were abundantly evident."&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; On 5 October 1938, she was one of the original 16 singers in [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]]'s ''[[Serenade to Music]]''.&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt;

After her retirement, she was a professor at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] from 1965 to 1973.&lt;ref name=indie/&gt; Along with [[Eva Turner]] and [[Roy Henderson (baritone)|Roy Henderson]], Mary Jarred took part in a BBC Radio broadcast written and presented by [[J. B. Steane|John Steane]] in 1989 celebrating the 50th anniversary of the ''Serenade to Music.''&lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 4, 5 January 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Midwest Program on Airborne Television Instruction''' (MPATI) was a special broadcasting initiative designed to broadcast [[educational television]] programming to schools, especially in areas where local educational television stations are either hard to receive or unavailable.
From 1961 through 1968, MPATI's programming broadcast from two [[Douglas DC-6|DC-6AB]] aircraft based at the [[Purdue University Airport]] in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]], using a broadcasting technique known as [[Stratovision]].

==History==
The undertaking began as a three-year experiment in 1960, with MPATI organizing, producing, and broadcasting instructional television with [[seed money]] from the [[Ford Foundation]]. This was a nonprofit organization of educators and television producers that pioneered instructional television for enriching education in public schools throughout the midwest. This was in times prior to the advent of satellite television transmission. By 1963, MPATI moved into its second phase where it relied totally on membership fees but it was never financially stable. MPATI found it difficult to get enough member schools to finance the organization. In its third reorganization, MPATI, unable to meet its expenses through membership fees, ceased producing and broadcasting courses in 1968 and became a tape library.

One of the two aircraft would go aloft for six to eight hours at a time; take up a twenty-minute figure-eight station centered over [[Montpelier, Indiana]] (35 miles north of [[Muncie, Indiana]]) at an altitude of 23,000 feet. From this position the range of transmission was approximately 200 miles in diameter; stations transmission included both Chicago and Detroit metropolitan areas. When on station the plane would reduce speed, and then lower a forty-foot antenna mast which was gyroscopically stabilized so that the antenna always aligned from the aircraft to the center of the earth. This stabilization feature helped to maintain polarization of the signals from these planes. Beam characteristics of the antenna were sharp and reception was optimized by placing the reception antenna as near as practical to the ground and pointing it toward the Montpelier location to minimize multipath canceling and interference.

Programming from the planes was always pre-recorded; program slates, taped classroom instruction and test patterns with canned music were all that was aired from the MPATI planes. Frequently snowy pictures were what students saw from the low power transmitters of KS2XGA or KS2XGD channels 72 and 76 UHF respectively.

The television equipment and transmitters were powered by a gas-turbine electrical power plant in the aft end of the DC-6 fuselage; equipment similar in design to auxiliary power units later jet transport aircraft use for engine starting.

[[Image:US pilots certificate back.jpg|thumb|280px|Back side of an airman certificate issued by the FAA.]]

'''Pilot certification in the United States''' is typically required for an individual to act as a [[aviator|pilot]]-in-command of an [[aircraft]]. It is regulated by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA), a branch of the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] (USDOT). A pilot is certified under the authority of Parts 61 or (if training was conducted by an FAA-approved school) 141 of Title 14 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], also known as the [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] (FARs).

An FAA-issued ''pilot certificate'' is evidence that an individual is duly authorized to exercise piloting privileges. The pilot certificate is one of several kinds of ''airman certificates'' issued by the FAA.

==General structure of certification==
A pilot is certificated to fly aircraft at one or more named ''privilege levels'' and, at each privilege level, rated to fly aircraft of specific ''categories''. Privilege levels of pilot certificates are, in order of increasing privilege:&lt;ref name=61.5&gt;{{cite web
  | title = 14 CFR Part 61 "Certification: Pilots, Flight Instructors, and Ground Instructors", Subpart A—General, Section 61.5 "Certificates and ratings issued under this part"
  | publisher = [[Code of Federal Regulations|US Code of Federal Regulations]], [[Federal Aviation Regulations]]
  | url = http://ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=40760189a03dfea0b501608f33820a45&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:2.0.1.1.2&amp;idno=14#14:2.0.1.1.2.1.1.4
  | accessdate = 2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Student Pilot''': an individual who is learning to fly under the tutelage of a [[flight instructor]] and who is permitted to fly alone under specific, limited circumstances
*'''Sport Pilot''': an individual who is authorized to fly only [[Light-sport Aircraft]]
*'''Remote Pilot:''' an individual who may fly small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for compensation or hire
*'''Recreational Pilot''': an individual who may fly aircraft of up to {{convert|180|hp}} and 4 seats in the daytime for pleasure only
*'''Private Pilot''': an individual who may fly for pleasure or personal business, generally without accepting compensation
*'''Commercial Pilot''': an individual who may, with some restrictions, fly for compensation or hire
*'''Airline Transport Pilot''' (often called '''ATP'''): an individual authorized to act as pilot for a scheduled airline.  (First Officers that fly under 14CFR 121 are required to hold an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate as of August 1, 2013.)

Pilots can be rated in these aircraft categories:&lt;ref name="61.5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ultralight aircraft (United States)|ultralight]] category of aircraft in the US requires no specific training and no certification.  Examples include [[powered parachute]], and weight-shift-control aircraft.  However, sporting groups give extensive training and certification for these aircraft.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Airplane]]
* [[Rotorcraft]]
* [[Glider aircraft|Glider]]
* [[Lighter than air]]
* [[Powered lift]]
* [[Powered parachute]]
* [[Weight-shift control]]

Most aircraft categories are further broken down into ''classes''.  If a category is so divided, a pilot must hold a [[class rating]] to operate an aircraft in that class:&lt;ref name=61.5/&gt;
* The Airplane category is divided into single-engine land (ASEL), multi-engine land (AMEL), single-engine sea (ASES), and multi-engine sea (AMES) classes
* The Rotorcraft category is divided into [[helicopter]] and [[gyroplane]] classes
* The Lighter-than-air category is divided into [[airship]] and [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] classes
* The Powered parachute category is divided into powered parachute land and powered parachute sea
* The Weight-shift-control category is divided into weight-shift-control land and weight-shift-control sea

A student pilot certificate does not list category or class ratings but is instead endorsed by a flight instructor to confer privileges in specific makes and models of aircraft.

A ''[[type rating]]'' is required in a specific make and model of aircraft if the aircraft weighs more than {{convert|12500|lb|abbr=on}} at takeoff or is powered by one or more [[turbojet engine]]s. The [[Boeing 747]], [[Beechcraft Super King Air|Beechcraft Super King Air 350]], and the [[Hawker Hunter]] are examples of aircraft that require type ratings.&lt;ref name=61.5/&gt;

To legally operate under instrument flight rules (IFR), a pilot can separately add an [[instrument rating]] to a private or commercial certificate. An airline transport pilot implicitly holds an instrument rating, so the instrument rating does not appear on an ATP certificate. The FAA issues instrument ratings separately for airplane and powered lift categories and the helicopter class (INSTA and INSTH).&lt;ref name=61.5 /&gt; Glider and airship pilots may also operate under [[Instrument Flight Rules]] under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=61.3&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; An individual may hold only one pilot certificate at one time; that certificate may authorize multiple privilege levels distinguished by aircraft category, class or type. For example, an Airline Transport Pilot certificate holder may be permitted to exercise ATP privileges when flying multi-engine land airplanes, but only Commercial Pilot privileges when flying [[single engine aircraft|single-engine]] land airplanes and gliders.  Similarly a Commercial Pilot holder with a glider rating may have only Private Pilot privileges for single-engine land airplanes.

The FAA may impose ''limitations'' on a pilot certificate if, during training or the practical test, the pilot does not demonstrate all skills necessary to exercise all privileges of a privilege level, category, class or type rating.  For example, a holder of a [[DC-3]] type rating who does not demonstrate instrument flying skills during the practical test would be assigned a limitation reading, "DC-3 (VFR Only)".

To obtain a certificate or add a rating, a pilot usually has to undergo a course of training with a Certificated Flight Instructor (CFI) under 14CFR61 or enroll at an approved course at a 14CFR141 approved flight school.  The applicant must accumulate and log specific aeronautical experience, and pass a three-part examination: a ''knowledge test'' (a computerized multiple-choice test, typically called the "written test"), an ''oral'' test, and a ''practical'' test carried out by either an FAA inspector or a [[Designated Pilot Examiner]].

Another form of authorization is a logbook ''endorsement'' from a flight instructor that establishes that the certificate holder has received training in specific skill areas that do not warrant a full test, such as the ability to fly a tailwheel-equipped, high-performance, complex, or pressurized airplane.

Pilot certificates do not expire, although they may be suspended or revoked by the FAA.&lt;ref&gt;Certain privileges conferred by a pilot certificate are restricted when the holder reaches age 60 and expire at age 65.  See {{cite web
  | title = 14 CFR Part 61 "Certification: Pilots, Flight Instructors, and Ground Instructors", Subpart A—General, Section 61.3 "Requirement for certificates,ratings and authorizations"

  | accessdate = 2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a pilot must maintain ''currency'' &amp;mdash; recent flight experience that is relevant to the flight being undertaken. To remain current, every pilot has to undergo a [[Biennial flight review|flight review]] with an instructor every 24 calendar months unless she or he gains a new pilot certificate or rating in that time or satisfies the flight review requirement using an alternate approved means. For most types of certificate, she or he must also undergo a [[physical examination|medical examination]] at intervals ranging from six months to five years, depending on the pilot's age and desired flight privileges. Other currency requirements apply to the carriage of passengers or to flight under [[instrument flight rules]] (IFR).

A medical certificate is not necessary to fly a glider, balloon, or light-sport Aircraft. An [[ultralight aviation|ultralight]] aircraft may be piloted without a pilot certificate or a medical certificate.

In addition to pilot certificates, the FAA issues separate airman certificates for Flight Engineers, Flight Instructors, Ground Instructors, Aircraft Dispatchers, Mechanics, Repairmen, Parachute Riggers, Control Tower Operators, Flight Navigators, and Flight Attendants.&lt;ref name="faa-airmen-cert"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pilot training ==
Most pilots in the U.S. undergo [[flight training]] as private individuals with a flight instructor, who may be employed by a flight school. Those who have decided on aviation as a career often begin with an undergraduate aviation-based education. Some pilots are trained in the military and are issued with civilian certificates based on their military record. Others are trained directly by airlines. The pilot may choose to be trained under Part 61 or Part 141 of the FARs. Part 141 requires that a certificated flight school provide an approved, structured course of training, which includes a specified number of hours of ground training (for example, 35 hours for Private Pilot in an airplane). Part 61 sets out a list of knowledge and experience requirements, and is more suitable for students who cannot commit to a structured plan, or for training from freelance instructors. Under Part 61 pilot training, individuals can become a private pilot in about three months and a commercial pilot in as quick as seven months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Become a Pilot – Steps, Cost, &amp; Eligibility / ATP Flight School|url=https://atpflightschool.com/faqs/how-to-become-a-pilot.html|website=atpflightschool.com|publisher=ATP Flight School|accessdate=7 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Knowledge tests ===
Most pilot certificates and ratings require the applicant to pass a knowledge test, also called the written test. The knowledge test results are valid for a period of 2 years, and are usually a prerequisite for practical tests. Resources available to prepare for the knowledge test may be obtained from pilot supply stores or vendors. The exceptions where a knowledge exam is not required for a practical test are for some add-on ratings after the initial license, such as a powered aircraft pilot adding another category rating at the same license level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = 14 CFR Part 61 "Certification: Pilots, Flight Instructors, and Ground Instructors", Subpart B—Aircraft Ratings and Pilot Authorizations, Section 61.63 "Additional aircraft ratings (other than on an airline transport pilot certificate)"

  | url = http://ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=40760189a03dfea0b501608f33820a45&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:2.0.1.1.2&amp;idno=14#14:2.0.1.1.2.2.1.2
  | accessdate = 2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To take knowledge tests for all pilot certificates and ratings, the applicant must have a sign-off from a ground or flight instructor. These are usually given by an instructor who has taught a ground school course, provided ground instruction or reviewed the applicant's self-study preparations. Certain circumstances don't require sign-offs for some flight instructor or airline transport pilot knowledge tests.

=== Practical tests ===
All pilots certificates and ratings require a practical test, usually called a ''check ride''. For each practical test, the FAA publishes a Practical Test Standards document that they expect the applicant to study, the flight instructor to teach and evaluate against, and the examiner to use to conduct the exam. A practical test is administered by an FAA Inspector or an FAA [[Designated Pilot Examiner]]. The check-ride is divided into two parts: the oral exam followed by a flight test in the aircraft. Upon successful completion of the practical test, the examiner issues a temporary airman certificate with the new license or rating. To take practical tests for all pilot certificates and ratings (except airline transport pilot), the applicant must have proper logbook endorsements from their flight instructor.

=== Becoming a professional pilot ===
In aviation, a pilot's level of income and experience are closely related. There are multiple ways to gain the experience required for hire by a scheduled air carrier. Air carriers generally require that the pilots they hire have hours of experience far in excess of the legal minimum. Effective August 1, 2013, all airline pilots must have an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate (ATP) or an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate with restricted Privileges (ATP-r). An ATP allows a pilot to act as the Captain or First Officer of an airline flight and requires 1,500 hours of total flight time as well as other requirements (i.e. 25 hours of night, 23 years old), see [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=43480f59479f9a1019f8298ad787a84e&amp;node=14:2.0.1.1.2.7.1.7&amp;rgn=div8 14CFR61.159].  An ATP-r certificate allows a pilot to act as a First Officer in a two pilot crew if they do not meet certain requirements. For example, the total flight time requirement is reduced to as little as 750 hours and the age requirement is reduced to 21.  [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=43480f59479f9a1019f8298ad787a84e&amp;node=14:2.0.1.1.2.7.1.8&amp;rgn=div8 see 14CFR61.160].

Experience is often gained using these methods:
* Military training (because of increased retention efforts by the military services and reduced numbers of active pilots, this is no longer a major source of pilots entering civilian careers),
* Independent training followed by becoming a part- or full-time instructor.
* A college-level aviation program, in which a bachelor's degree (commonly in Aviation Science or a related field) is conferred upon the completion of both flight and classroom coursework. Frequently, upperclassmen are employed as flight instructors for other students.
* Banner towing, traffic reporting, skydiver pilot, fire patrol, pipeline patrol, aerial photography, glider towing, or other "odd jobs" in aviation are fairly low-paying and require only the legal minimum experience.  Reaching the regulatory 1,200 hour flight time minimum to act as pilot-in-command under Part 135 on-demand operations is a common means of gaining experience in line operations, weather flying, etc., leading to passenger airline jobs.

== Pilot certificates ==
The FAA offers a progression of pilot certificates or licenses. Each license has varying experience and knowledge requirements and has varying privileges and limitations.

=== Student pilot ===
A student pilot certificate is obtained through the FAA's Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IACRA Certification Application List|url=https://iacra.faa.gov/IACRA/PathList.aspx|website=Federal Aviation Administration|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student pilot certificate is only required when exercising solo flight privileges. Student pilots must also possess a medical certificate when conducting flights requiring medical certification.  As of April 1, 2016 student pilot certificates do not expire.  Once a student has accrued sufficient training and experience, a CFI can ''endorse'' the student's logbook to authorize limited solo flight in a specific type (make and model) of aircraft. Additional endorsements must be logged for specific airports where a student operates solo.

There is no minimum aeronautical knowledge or experience requirement for the issuance of a student pilot certificate. There are, however, minimum aeronautical knowledge and experience requirements for student pilots to solo, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = 14 CFR Part 61 "Certification: Pilots, Flight Instructors, and Ground Instructors", Subpart C "Student Pilots"
  | publisher = [[Code of Federal Regulations|US Code of Federal Regulations]], [[Federal Aviation Regulations]]
  | url = http://ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=40760189a03dfea0b501608f33820a45&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:2.0.1.1.2&amp;idno=14#14:2.0.1.1.2.3
  | accessdate = 2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solo requirements:
* Be at least 16 years of age (14 for glider or balloon)
* Read, speak, write, and understand the English language.
* Demonstrate satisfactory aeronautical knowledge on a knowledge test, including knowledge of the following areas:
** Airspace rules and procedures for the airport where the solo flight is performed
** Flight characteristics and operational limitations for the make and model of aircraft to be flown
* Receive and log flight training for the maneuvers and procedures appropriate to the make and model of aircraft to be flown, including:
** Preflight preparation
** Taxiing or surface operations, including run-ups
** Takeoffs and landings, including normal and cross-wind
** Straight and level flight, and turns in both directions
** Climbs and climbing turns
** Airport traffic patterns, including entry and departure procedures
** Collision avoidance, wind shear avoidance, and wake turbulence avoidance
** Descents, with and without turns, using high and low drag configurations
** Flight at various airspeeds from cruise to slow flight
** Stall entries from various flight attitudes and power combinations with recovery initiated at the first indication of a stall, and recovery from a full stall
** Emergency procedures and equipment malfunctions
** Ground reference maneuvers
** Approaches to a landing area with simulated engine malfunctions
** Slips to a landing
** Go-arounds
Limitations while flying solo:
* May not carry passengers.
* May not fly for hire or in furtherance of a business.
* May not fly in other than [[Visual meteorological conditions|VMC]] or above clouds when visual reference cannot be made to the surface.
* May not fly contrary to limitations placed in logbook by instructor.

=== Sport pilot ===
The sport pilot certificate was created in September 2004 .The intent of the new rule was to lower the barriers of entry into aviation and make flying more affordable and accessible.

The new rule also created the [[Light Sport Aircraft]] (LSA) category of aircraft, which are smaller, lower-powered aircraft.  The sport pilot certificate offers limited privileges mainly for recreational use. It is the only powered aircraft certificate that does not require a medical certificate; a valid vehicle driver's license can be used as proof of medical competence ''provided'' the prospective pilot was not rejected for their last Airman Medical Certificate.

Before a trainee can start the solo phase of flight training, a Student Sport Pilot Certificate must be issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). These may be obtained from an FAA Flight Standards District Office or FAA Designated Pilot Examiner.

To qualify for the sport pilot certificate, an applicant must:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = 14 CFR Part 61 "Certification: Pilots, Flight Instructors, and Ground Instructors", Subpart J "Sport Pilots"
  | publisher = [[Code of Federal Regulations|US Code of Federal Regulations]], [[Federal Aviation Regulations]]
  | url = http://ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=40760189a03dfea0b501608f33820a45&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:2.0.1.1.2&amp;idno=14#14:2.0.1.1.2.10
  | accessdate = 2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Be at least 16 years of age (14 for glider or balloon)
* Be able to read, speak, write, and understand English
* Log at least 20 hours of flight time, of which at least
** 15 hours must be dual instruction with a qualified flight instructor
*** 2 hours must be cross-country dual instruction
** 5 hours must be solo flight
* Fly one solo cross-country flight over a total distance of 75 or more nautical miles to two different destinations to a full-stop landing.  At least one leg of this cross-country must be over a total distance of at least {{convert|25|nmi|km}}.
* Have received 2 hours of dual instruction in the preceding 60 days, in preparation for the Practical Test
* Pass a Knowledge (written) test
* Pass a Practical (oral and flight) test
* Have a valid US State drivers license or a current 3rd class or higher Airman Medical Certificate
The above requirements are for heavier-than-air powered aircraft (airplanes).  The requirements for gliders, balloons, gyroplanes, and dirigibles vary slightly.

Sport pilots are only eligible to fly aircraft that are either certificated specifically as light-sport aircraft (LSA) or were certificated prior to the LSA regulations and are within the maximum weight and performance limitations of [[light-sport aircraft]].

The restrictions placed on a Pilot exercising the privileges of a Sport pilot certificate are:
* No more than one passenger
* Daytime flight only ([[twilight|civil twilight]] is used to define day/night)
* [[Maximum Takeoff Weight]] of 1320&amp;nbsp;lbs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aopa.org/training-and-safety|title=Training &amp; Safety: Your tools to being a safer pilot|author=|date=29 March 2016|website=aopa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to {{convert|12500|lb|abbr=on}} of the [[Private Pilot License|Private Pilot Certificate]] or the [[Pilot certification in the United States#Recreational pilot|Recreational Pilot Certificate]].
* No flight above {{convert|10000|ft|m}} [[Sea level#Aviation|MSL]] or {{convert|2000|ft|m}} [[Above ground level|AGL]], whichever is higher (this automatically excludes flight in [[Airspace class (United States)#Class A|Class A airspace]])
* No flight in any of the airspace classes that require radio communication ([[Airspace class (United States)#Class B|B]], [[Airspace class (United States)#Class B|C]], or [[Airspace class (United States)#Class D|D]]) without first obtaining additional instruction and instructor endorsement

The Sport pilot certificate is also ineligible for additional ratings (such as an [[Instrument rating]]), although time in light-sport aircraft can be used towards the experience requirement of other ratings on higher certificate types.

=== Recreational pilot ===
The recreational pilot certificate requires less training and offers fewer privileges than the private pilot certificate. It was originally created for flying small single-engine planes for personal enjoyment; the newer Sport Pilot certificate overlaps this need and is easier to get, but the recreational certificate allows access to larger single-engine aircraft, and instructor endorsements are available to recreational pilots that are not applicable to sport pilots, such as flying at night or cross-country.
 
Eligibility requirements:
* Be at least 17 years old
* Be able to read, speak, write and understand the English language
* Pass a required knowledge test
* Pass a required oral and practical flight test administered by a FAA designated examiner
* Hold either a student or sport pilot certificate.&lt;ref&gt;FAR 61.96&lt;/ref&gt;
* Meet the following experience requirements:
** 30 hours of flight time (15 hours of flight training, 3 hours of solo time, 2 hours of cross country &gt; 25NM)&lt;ref&gt;FAR 61.99&lt;/ref&gt;
Limitations and restrictions (without additional endorsement):
* May not carry more than one passenger.
* May not fly to an airport further than 50&amp;nbsp;nmi from the departure point.
* May not fly in Class B, C, D airspace or to any controlled airport.
* May not fly an aircraft that has more than four seats, a tailwheel, more than one engine, or more than 180&amp;nbsp;hp.
* May not fly aircraft falling under the definition of a [[complex airplane]], with retractable gear, adjustable flaps and variable-pitch propeller.
* May not fly between sunset and sunrise.
* May not fly above 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft MSL or 2,000&amp;nbsp;ft AGL (whichever is higher)&lt;ref&gt;FAR 61.101&lt;/ref&gt;
* If pilot has logged less than 400 hours and has not acted as pilot in command within 180 days, a flight review is required prior to any flight without an instructor.

Most of the above limitations, except the one-passenger, four-seat and single-engine restrictions, can be relaxed or lifted individually through instructor endorsement. These endorsements are obtained by participating in a prescribed course of ground and/or flight instruction given by an FAA-certificated instructor, including a minimum number of instructor-led flight in a plane or situation normally requiring the endorsement. Common types of endorsement for recreational pilots can allow:

* Taking off from and landing at controlled airports and flying within their Class B/C/D airspace.
* Command of "[[complex airplane]]s" with mechanisms or flight systems including retractable gear, flaps, and variable-pitch propellers.
* Command of "high-performance" aircraft with engine ratings in excess of 180&amp;nbsp;hp.
* Command of pressurized aircraft at altitudes exceeding 10,000 MSL (but not above FL180).
* Command of tailwheel aircraft (many such designs are WWII-era fighters which usually also require "complex" and "high-performance" endorsements).
* Command of a specific make and model of aircraft, regardless of its capabilities.
** The aircraft endorsed must still be single-engined and have four or fewer seats; a recreational pilot may be endorsed for a [[Mooney Bravo]] or even a [[P-51]] without having general endorsements for high-performance, complex or tailwheel aircraft, but cannot be endorsed to fly a six-seat [[Cessna 206]] or twin-engine [[Piper Aztec]].
* Flights beyond 50NM from the departure point, including cross-country VFR flying.
* Night flying by VFR (an [[instrument rating]] is still required for night SVFR/IFR, and practically requires a private pilot certification)

A recreational pilot will typically only get a few of these, to allow operation of an aircraft in a few exceptional situations applicable to their locale (the Class B/C/D endorsement, for instance, is practically required for pilots living in major cities). Pilots requiring a large subset of these endorsements are typically better served by obtaining their private pilot certification.

=== Private pilot ===
The [[Private Pilot License|private pilot certificate]] is the certificate held by the majority of active pilots. It allows command of any aircraft (subject to appropriate ratings) for any non-commercial purpose, and gives almost unlimited authority to fly under [[visual flight rules]] (VFR). Passengers may be carried and flight in furtherance of a business is permitted; however, a private pilot may not be compensated in any way for services as a pilot, although passengers can pay a ''[[pro rata]]'' share of flight expenses, such as fuel or rental costs. Private pilots may also operate charity flights, subject to certain restrictions, and may participate in similar activities, such as [[Angel Flight]], [[Civil Air Patrol]] and many others.

The requirements to obtain a private pilot certificate for "airplane, single-engine, land", or [[Asel|ASEL]], (which is the most common certificate) are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Be able to read, speak, write and understand the English language
* Obtain at least a third class medical certificate from an Aviation Medical Examiner (except for glider or balloon)
* Pass a computerized aeronautical knowledge test
* Accumulate and log a specified amount of training and experience, including the following:
** If training under Part 61, Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) section 61.109, requires at least 40 hours of flight time, including 20 hours of flight with an instructor and 10 hours of solo flight (i.e., by yourself), and other requirements including cross-country flight, which include
*** Solo requirements:
***# 5 hours of solo cross-country time
***# One solo cross-country flight of at least {{convert|150|nmi|km|abbr=on}} total distance, with full-stop landings at a minimum of three points and with one segment of the flight consisting of a straight-line distance of at least {{convert|50|nmi|km|abbr=on}} between the takeoff and landing locations
***# Three solo takeoffs and landings to a full stop at an airport with an operating control tower.
*** Night requirements:
***# 3 hours of night flight training
***# 10 takeoffs and 10 landings to a full stop (with each landing involving a flight in the traffic pattern) at an airport
***# 1 cross country flight of 100 nm total distance at night
*** 3 hours of flight training on the control and maneuvering solely by reference to instruments
*** 3 hours of flight training for cross country flights
*** 3 hours of flight training with an authorized instructor in preparation for the practical test, which must have been performed within the preceding 2 calendar months from the month of the test
** If training under Part 141, at least 35 hours of piloting time including 20 hours with an instructor and 5 hours of solo flight, and other requirements including cross-country and night flights
* Pass an oral test and flight test administered by an FAA inspector, FAA-designated examiner, or authorized check instructor

=== Commercial pilot ===
A certificated [[commercial pilot]] may act as [[pilot-in-command]] of an aircraft for compensation or hire, as well as carry persons or property for compensation or hire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commercial Pilot Certificate |url=https://atpflightschool.com/faqs/commercial-pilot-license.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training for the certificate focuses on a better understanding of aircraft systems and a higher standard of [[airmanship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The commercial certificate itself does not allow a pilot to fly in [[instrument meteorological conditions]].  For aircraft categories where an instrument rating is available, commercial pilots without an [[instrument rating]] are restricted to daytime flight within {{convert|50|nmi|km}} when carrying passengers for hire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2013-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commercial airplane pilot must be able to operate a [[complex airplane]], as a specific number of hours of complex (or turbine-powered) aircraft time are among the prerequisites. 

The requirements are:
* Be at least 18 years of age
* Hold a private pilot certificate
* Be able to read, speak, write, and understand the English language
* Accumulate and log a specified amount of training and experience; the following are part of the airplane single-engine land class rating requirements:
** If training under Part 61, at least 250 hours of piloting time including 20 hours of training with an instructor and 10 hours of solo flight, and other requirements including several "cross-country" flights, i.e., more than 50 nautical miles (93&amp;nbsp;km)(25 NM for helicopter rate)  from the departure airport (which include Day VFR and Night VFR {{convert|100|nmi|km|abbr=on}} between beginning point and destination, with a time of at least two hours; also one cross country of at least {{convert|250|nmi|km|abbr=on}} to the destination, a {{convert|300|nmi|km|abbr=on}} total distance, with landings at three airports) and both solo and instructor-accompanied night flights
** If training under Part 141, at least 150 hours of training time including 55 hours with an instructor and 10 hours of solo flight, and other requirements including several cross-country, solo, and night flights
* Pass a 100-question aeronautical knowledge written test
* Pass an oral test and flight test administered by an FAA inspector, FAA-designated examiner, or authorized check instructor

By itself, this certificate does not permit the pilot to set up an operation that carries members of the public for hire; such operations are governed by other regulations. Otherwise, a commercial pilot can be paid for certain types of operation, such as banner towing, agricultural applications, and photography, and can be paid for instructing if she or he holds a flight instructor certificate (In the case of lighter-than-air, only a commercial pilot certificate is required to teach for that category). To fly for hire, the pilot must hold a second class medical certificate, which is valid for 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=14 CFR §61.23 |url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=59b84b086d2d94dba92408b5eface58f&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se14.2.61_123&amp;rgn=div8 |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the commercial certificate reduces the pilot’s insurance premiums, as it is evidence of training to a higher safety standard.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

=== Airline transport pilot ===
An airline transport pilot (commonly called an "[[Airline Transport Pilot License|ATP]]") is tested to the highest level of piloting ability. The certificate is a prerequisite for acting as a flight crew-member in scheduled airline operations.

The minimum pilot experience is 1,500 hours of flight time (1200 for Helicopters), 500 hours of cross-country flight time, 100 hours of night flight time, and 75 hours instrument operations time (simulated or actual). Other requirements include being 23 years of age, an instrument rating, being able to read, write, speak, and understand the English language, a rigorous written examination, and being of good moral character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An Airline Transport Pilot - restricted (ATP-r) is also available for pilots that do not meet the more rigorous requirements of an ATP.  The only hour requirement for the ATP-r is 1,500 total and 200 cross country.  The "total time" requirement is reduced to 750 hours for former military pilots, 1,000 hours for graduates of university bachelor's degree programs, or 1,250 for graduates of university associate degree programs.  The holder of an ATP-r is limited to only serving as the First Officer in a two pilot operation.  Upon obtaining the requisite age and aeronautical experience, the pilot is issued an unrestricted ATP without further examination.  [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=43480f59479f9a1019f8298ad787a84e&amp;node=14:2.0.1.1.2.7.1.8&amp;rgn=div8 see 14CFR61.160 (requirements)] and [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=43480f59479f9a1019f8298ad787a84e&amp;node=14:2.0.1.1.2.7.1.12&amp;rgn=div8 14CFR61.167(privileges and limitations)]

It is possible to mix the license levels on one certificate.  For example, a private pilot with both glider and airplane ratings could earn a commercial license for gliders.  The new license would then list the airplane ratings as having only "private privileges."

== Number of active pilots ==
As of the end of 2017, in the US, there were an estimated 609,306 active certificated pilots.&lt;ref name="totalairmen"&gt;[https://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation_data_statistics/civil_airmen_statistics/], Table 1, retrieved 20 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  This number has been declining gradually over the past several decades, down from a high of over 827,000 pilots in 1980.  There were 702,659 in 1990 and 625,581 in 2000.  The numbers include:

* 120,546 student pilots (128,663 in 1990 and 93,064 in 2000)
* 220 recreational pilots (87 in 1990 and 340 in 2000)
* 5,157 sport pilots (did not exist until 2005)
* 174,883 private pilots (299,111 in 1990 and 251,561 in 2000)
* 104,322 commercial pilots (149,666 in 1990 and 121,858 in 2000)
* 152,933 airline transport pilots (107,732 in 1990 and 141,596 in 2000)
* 19,927 glider-only pilots (9,567 in 1990 and 7,775 in 2000)
* 15,511 rotorcraft-(helicopter)-only pilots (7,833 in 1990 and 9,387 in 2000)
* 554,177 male pilots end of 2014
* 39,322 female pilots end of 2014

These numbers are based on the highest certifications held by individual pilots.

The numbers also include: 
* 100,993 certificated flight instructors (CFIs) (63,775 in 1990 and 80,931 in 2000)
* 306,066 pilots overall who held instrument ratings (297,073 in 1990 and 311,944 in 2000)

An active pilot is defined as one who holds both a pilot certificate and a valid medical certificate, for certifications that require a medical certificate.

== Other certificates and ratings ==
* A '''[[flight instructor]] certificate''' authorizes the holder to give training and endorsement for a certificate, and perform a flight review.
* A Ground Instructor Certificate authorizes the holder to give ground instruction, give knowledge exam endorsements, and provide the ground training portion of a flight review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asaviationservices.com/groundinstructor.html|title=asaviationservices.com|author=|date=|website=www.asaviationservices.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An '''[[Instrument Rating in the United States|instrument rating]]''' is required to fly under [[instrument flight rules]]. Instrument ratings are issued for a specific category of aircraft; a pilot certificated to fly an airplane under IFR has an ''Instrument Airplane'' rating.
* An '''instrument instructor rating''' authorizes a certificated flight instructor to give training and endorsement for an instrument rating pilot.
* A '''multi-engine rating''' is required to fly an airplane with more than one engine. It is the most common example of a [[class rating]].
* A '''multi-engine instructor rating''' authorizes a certificated flight instructor to give training and endorsement for a multi-engine rating.

[[United States military]] pilots are issued an [[United States Aviator Badge|Aviator Badge]] upon completion of flight training and issuance of a pilot's certificate.  Badges for crew or ground positions are also issued to qualified applicants.

Unmanned Aircraft System (Drone) pilots are required to obtain a remote pilot airman certificate with a small UAS rating when operating commercially.

== Medical certification and requirements ==
All certificated pilots, with the exception of those with a sport or Recreational pilot certificate&lt;ref&gt;Code of Federal Regulations: Title 14: Aeronautics and Space 
PART 61—CERTIFICATION: PILOTS, FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS, AND GROUND INSTRUCTORS 
Subpart D  § 61.96   Applicability and eligibility requirements: General.—Recreational Pilots 
&lt;/ref&gt; (or when in command of balloons or gliders, including power assisted gliders), are required to maintain a medical certification commensurate with the privileges they intend to exercise as pilot-in-command of an aircraft.

For sport pilot certificate applicants or holders, regulations state that a medical is required if the applicant/pilot does not hold a valid United States drivers license.

To obtain a medical certification, pilots are required to undergo a medical examination from an [[Aviation Medical Examiner]], or AME. The Aviation Medical Examiner performs an examination based upon the class of certification desired.

Medical certifications are divided into three classes:

===Third class===
Third class certifications require the least involved examinations of all medical certifications. They are required for those intending to be pilot-in-command of an aircraft under the Private or Recreational pilot certificates or while exercising solo privileges as a student pilot.
To qualify for a third class medical certificate, pilots must meet the following requirements:
*Distant vision: 20/40 or better in each eye separately,&lt;ref&gt;An individual with one eye, or effective visual acuity equivalent to monocular, may be considered for medical certification, any class, through the special issuance section of part 67 (14 CFR 67.401). (http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/exam_tech/et/31-34/mv/)&lt;/ref&gt; with or without correction
*Near vision: 20/40 or better in each eye separately, with or without correction, as measured at a distance of {{convert|16|in|mm}}
*Color vision: Demonstrate the ability to perceive the colors necessary for the safe performance of airman duties
*Hearing: Demonstrate the ability to hear an average conversational voice in a quiet room, using both ears, at a distance of six feet, with their back turned to the examiner, or pass an approved audiometric test
*Ear, Nose, and Throat: Exhibit no ear disease or condition manifested by, or that may reasonably be expected to be manifested by, vertigo or a disturbance of speech or equilibrium
*Blood Pressure: Under 155/95
*Mental Status: No diagnosis of [[psychosis]], bipolar disorder, or severe [[personality disorder]]s
*Substance Dependence: No dependence on alcohol or any pharmacological substance in the previous two years

For pilots under 40 years of age, third class medical certificates expire on the last day of the month they were issued, five years from the date of issue. The FAA changed this rule from three to five years on July 24, 2008.&lt;ref name="edocket.access.gpo.gov"&gt;(http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2008/pdf/E8-16911.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aopa.org"&gt;(http://www.aopa.org/flightplanning/articles/2008/080723medical.html)&lt;/ref&gt; For all others, they expire on the last day of the month they were issued, two years from the date of issue.

In December 2015, the U.S. Senate passed a bill sponsored by Montana Senator Steve Daines, S. 571- Pilot’s Bill of Rights 2 (PBOR 2). If signed into law, the bill would expand the third class medical exemption for recreational pilots by reforming the FAA’s medical certification process to include more qualified, trained pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Bill Information (Except Text) for S.571 - Pilot's Bill of Rights 2|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/571/all-info#all-actions|website=Congress.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate Commerce Committee passes Daines’ pilot protection bill|url=http://riponadvance.com/stories/senate-commerce-committee-passes-daines-pilot-protection-bill/|accessdate=29 December 2015|work=The Ripon Advance|date=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second class ===
A second class medical is required for those intending to exercise the privileges of the commercial pilot certificate.  It is possible to obtain a commercial pilot certificate while holding a third class medical, but with the exception of flight instruction, the licensee cannot exercise privileges beyond that of a private pilot.

To qualify for a second class medical certificate, pilots must meet the requirements for the third class certificate plus:
* Distant vision: 20/20 or better in each eye separately, with or without correction
* Intermediate vision: 20/40 or better in each eye separately, with or without correction, at age 50 and over, as measured at 32&amp;nbsp;inches

Second class certificates are valid until the last day of the month, twelve months after they were issued. The certificate holder may then only exercise the privileges of a third class medical certificate.

=== First class ===
First class certificates are required for those intending to be pilot-in-command in an air carrier operation requiring an Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate. Other operations, including those under Part 91, may require a first class medical for insurance purposes, although it is not a federal requirement in such cases.

To qualify for the first class medical certificate, pilots must meet the requirements for the third and second class certificates plus:
* Heart Function: Electrocardiogram must show normal heart function once at age 35 and annually for those age 40 and over

For pilots under 40 years of age, first class medical certificates expire on the last day of the month they were issued, one year from the date of issue. The FAA introduced this rule on July 24, 2008.&lt;ref name="edocket.access.gpo.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aopa.org"/&gt;
For all others, they are valid until the last day of the month, six months after they were issued. The certificate holder may then only exercise the privileges of a second class medical certificate until the last day of the month, twelve months after the certificate was issued, thereafter the privileges of a third class medical until the last day of the month, twenty four months after the medical was issued ( FAA $61.23 (d-1-iii) ).

=== Special issuance ===
Pilots who do not meet the above requirements may be issued a medical certificate under a "special issuance." A special issuance is essentially a waiver for a disqualifying condition and are evaluated case-by-case depending on the class of certificate requested. Minor problems can be overcome by a special issuance from an Aviation Medical Examiner, while others require a special issuance from the FAA directly.

=== Restrictions ===
Restrictions may be placed upon a medical certificate to mitigate any concern for safety. A common restriction for pilots who require glasses or contacts to meet the required visual acuity standards is that they "MUST WEAR CORRECTIVE LENSES."  Color-blind pilots are typically issued a restriction reading, "NOT VALID FOR NIGHT FLIGHT OR BY COLOR SIGNAL CONTROL."  This mitigates the concern that color-blind pilots may not be able to identify those colors required for the performance of safe airman duties by preventing situations that are considered potentially unsafe.

For color vision deficient pilots, in many cases these restrictions can be removed through use of an FAA approved alternative office based color vision test, which if passed, the applicant must continue to retake that same test (or any other passable tests) at every renewal.  If the pilot applicant is unable to pass any of the office based tests, a real world operational test is available.  This test consists of a ground-based chart reading and control tower signal light test for Third Class medical certification (This is called the Operational Color Vision Test or OCVT), and in addition to that, a specialized "Medical Flight Test" (MFT) is required for Second and First Class medical certification.  The applicant performs an actual flight test with an FAA Aviation Safety Inspector (ASI) for the purpose of further demonstrating "the ability to perceive those colors necessary for the safe performance of airman duties", which is the color vision requirement as written in the FARs.  Note that "Normal Color Vision" is not required, as a certain amount of color vision deficiency is considered safe and permitted.  If the tests are passed, a "Letter of Evidence" (LOE) from the FAA is issued, which serves as evidence that the pilot meets the standards for Color Vision and the AME is permitted to issue the class of Medical Certificate indicated on the LOE (All classes if both the OCVT and MFT are passed) with no related restriction if all other medical requirements are met.  This allows the pilot to receive a medical certificate with no restrictions related to color vision without the requirement of passing an office based color vision test at every subsequent renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/ame/guide/app_process/exam_tech/item52/amd/|title=Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners|author=|date=|website=www.faa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-pilot certifications ==
In addition to pilot licenses the FAA also issues other airmen certificates.

*  [[Flight Instructor]] certification is separate from pilot certification.  For every rating on a flight instructor certificate, there must already be a corresponding rating on the individual's commercial pilot certificate.  The applicant must also pass written and flight skills tests.
* [[Flight Engineer]] Certifications are applicable to large transportation aircraft (more than 80,000&amp;nbsp;lb). Flight Engineer Certificates are further Rated by type of engine they are trained and tested on: [[Turbofan|Turbojet]] Powered, [[Turbopropeller]] Powered, [[radial engine|Reciprocating Engine]] Powered. Flight Engineers are becoming less common as modern jets move towards two person flight crews.
* Flight Navigators certificates are still available, but modern technology and the high speed of jets has made the rating obsolete.
* [[Aviation Medical Examiner]], [[Ground Instructor]], [[Parachute rigger]], [[Aircraft Maintenance Technician]], [[Repairman]] and [[Air Traffic Controller]] are also federally certificated aviation-related positions.  Most of these also have their rating systems.  For example, an [[Airframe and Powerplant|A&amp;P]] is a certificated mechanic with both [[airframe]] and [[powerplant]] ratings, and a [[Ground Instructor]] may be rated to give Basic, Advanced, and/or [[Flight instruments|Instrument]] training.  Aircraft Inspection authorization (IA) is an additional privilege conferred on certificated mechanics who meet specific experience and training requirements.
* An [[Flight dispatcher|Aircraft Dispatcher]] Certificate is required for people involved in operational control/dispatch under 14 CFR Part 121 commercial operations. Qualification requirements can be found in [http://ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=f35b162c10fe55f8312195acd7a0019b&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:2.0.1.1.4&amp;idno=14#14:2.0.1.1.4.3.1.2. FAR 65.53]

Pilots do not need [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] licenses to use the radio within the United States (pilot certificates double as FCC radio licenses); however, other countries may require that a pilot have an FCC Restricted Radiotelephone Operator Permit (RR), and the aircraft radio station be licensed.

* [[Flight attendant]]s are trained to the level required to earn an FAA ''Certificate of Demonstrated Proficiency''.  This is not considered to be an airman certification.
* [[Avionics]] Techs. [[General radiotelephone operator license]] or (GROL) are certificated by the FCC.

== Costs and Ways to Save Money ==
Each certification varies in cost and depends on aircraft rental and instructor rates at a given flight school. On average, these are the costs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://work.chron.com/much-cost-pilot-license-11624.html|title=How Much Does it Cost to Get a Pilot License?|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for each pilot certification from least to greatest:

* Sport – $4,400
* Recreational – $7,700
* Private – $9,900
* Commercial (includes Complex/High Performance Training) – $4,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tandgflying.com/licensing-cost.html|title=Cost|website=T&amp;G Flying Club|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; to $8,500&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.touch-n-goes.com/commercial/commercialpilotpricing.html|title=Become A Commercial Pilot {{!}} Pricing {{!}} How much does it cost? {{!}} Flight Training {{!}} Flight Instruction {{!}} Flight School {{!}} Portland OR {{!}} Troutdale, and Hillsboro Oregon {{!}}  Vancouver, Washington {{!}} Airport {{!}} Pearson Airfield {{!}} Twin Oaks Airpark {{!}}|website=www.touch-n-goes.com|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming a pilot is expensive but there are many ways to save money:

* Seek internships or small jobs at flight schools or airports
* Prepare and study hard for tests and check-rides to complete stages faster (saving money)
* Buddy-up or share flights with other pilots while training or building hours. Join pilot clubs to meet other pilots or use smart phone apps such as BuddyFlight for connecting with other pilots&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://buddyflightapp.com|title=BuddyFlight iOS App {{!}} Pilot to Pilot Connections for Shared Flights|website=buddyflightapp.com|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use a simulator whenever possible
* Apply for scholarships
* Choose a flight school with a good reputation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://delsolaviation.com/22-money-saving-ways-to-keep-flight-training-costs-down/|title=22 Money-Saving Ways To Keep Flight Training Costs Down - Del Sol Aviation|date=2017-09-29|work=Del Sol Aviation|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Join the Civil Air Patrol (CAP)
* Build good credit (to get good rates on loans)
* Get your CFI certificate and instruct other pilots while gaining hours at no cost

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2920">'''Reception''', '''Year 0''', '''Nursery''', or '''FS2''' ('''foundation second year''') is the first year of [[primary school]] in the [[United Kingdom]] (except [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland]]). It comes after [[nursery school|nursery]] and before [[Year One (School)|Year One]] in [[England]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/overview|title=The national curriculum - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wales]] or [[Primary education#Northern Ireland|Primary 2]] in [[Northern Ireland]].

Pupils in Reception are usually aged between four and five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foundationyears.org.uk/school-reception-class/|title=School reception class - From pregnancy to children aged 5|website=www.foundationyears.org.uk|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children start school either in the term or in the year in which they reach four,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kent.gov.uk/education-and-children/schools/school-age|title=School age|website=www.kent.gov.uk|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the policy of the [[Local Education Authority]]. Reception is the final part of the [[Foundation Stage|Early Years Foundation Stage]] of education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Most areas admit entire year groups in September, regardless of which month they were born, meaning that some pupils will be starting primary school in the month of their four birthday, while others will be almost a year ahead of this milestone.

Other areas admit Reception pupils in the term of their fourth birthday, while some admit pupils in September if they were born between September and February, and in January if they were born between March and August.

There is no reception year in [[Scotland]] as children progress directly from Nursery to Primary 1 (equivalent to English Year 1) in the August nearest their fifth birthday. Generally this means that a complete intake into P1 ranges from four and a half to five and a half years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/parentzone/mychild/transitions/startingschool/index.asp|title=Starting school - Transitions -|website=www.educationscotland.gov.uk|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible for parents of children born in January and February to defer admission by one year, so that they start at five and a half rather than four and a half.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13386">The '''Reith Lectures''' is a series of annual [[radio]] [[lecture]]s given by leading figures of the day, commissioned by the [[BBC]] and broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] and the [[BBC World Service]]. The lectures were inaugurated in 1948 by the [[BBC]] to mark the historic contribution made to public service broadcasting by [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Lord Reith]], the corporation's first director-general.

Reith maintained that broadcasting should be a public service which enriches the intellectual and cultural life of the nation. It is in this spirit that the BBC each year invites a leading figure to deliver a series of lectures on radio. The aim is to advance public understanding and debate about significant issues of contemporary interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/the-reith-lectures/about/ |title=Radio 4 - The Reith Lectures - About Reith |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Reith lecturer was the philosopher and [[Nobel laureate]], [[Bertrand Russell]]. The first female lecturer was [[Margery Perham|Dame Margery Perham]] in 1961, who spoke on the impact of colonialism in her series of talks entitled ''The Colonial Reckoning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9lb4|title=Margery Perham: The Colonial Reckoning: 1961, The Reith Lectures - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest Reith Lecturer was [[Colin Blakemore]], who was 32 years old in 1976 when he broadcast six lectures on the brain and consciousness, titled ''Mechanics of the Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gmw6w|title=Colin Blakemore: Mechanics of the Mind: 1976, The Reith Lectures - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011 [[BBC Radio 4]] published its Reith Lectures archive.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13891740 | work=BBC News | title=BBC Radio 4 unveils 60 years of Reith Lectures archive | date=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included two podcasts featuring over 240 lectures from 1948 to the present day as well as streamed online audio, and the complete written transcripts of the entire Reith Lectures archive:

[[Image:Fachhochschule Köln - Ingenieurwissenschaftliches Zentrum (IWZ)-3628.jpg|thumb|The ''Ingenieurwissenschaftliche Zentrum (IWZ)'' in Koeln-Deutz]]
'''Rescue Engineering''' (RE) is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's-]] and [[master's degree]] at the [[Technical University of Cologne]] since 2002 and at the [[Hamburg]] University of Applied Sciences ([[Bachelor's degree|bachelor]] only) since 2006, this [[academic degree]] prepares for working at [[fire brigade]]s, [[emergency medical service]]es or other [[aid organisation]]s.

==University==
Rescue Engineering has existed since 2002, the [[precondition]]s being the ''allgemeinen Fachhochschulreife'' a [[work experience]] of four month. 
Rescue Engineering is a full-time study with [[lecture]]s and [[intern]]s. Support and many assistant professors come from the ''Institut für Notfallmedizin'' and the [[professional fire brigade]]s.

==Curriculum==
The [[curriculum]] is similar to [[industrial engineering]], fielded in parts of engineering, economics and social science.

The basics cover the subjects of [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[mechanics]], [[materials science]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[measurement engineering]].

The economics part consists of [[business and administration]], [[accounting]], [[tax]]es, [[logistics]], [[quality management]] and [[project management]]

In the field of the [[socioscientific]]s subjects like [[law]] and [[mediation]] but also [[public health]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[epidemiology]] should create comprehension for special task in the work of rescue.

==Career==
The alumnus can be employed at [[professional fire brigade]]s, GO or in the management of emergency medical servicees. Tasks in [[fire prevention]] in [[industry]] or [[commerce]] can also be a career destination.

The '''Rosetta Project''' is a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers working to develop a contemporary version of the historic [[Rosetta Stone]] to last from 2000 to [[Timeline of the far future#Technology and culture|12,000]] AD; it is run by the [[Long Now Foundation]]. Its goal is a meaningful survey and near permanent archive of 1,500 [[language]]s. Some of these languages have fewer than one thousand speakers left. Others are considered to be dying out because government centralization and [[globalization]] are increasing the prevalence of [[English language|English]] and other major languages. The intention is to create a unique platform for [[comparative linguistics|comparative linguistic]] research and education, as well as a functional linguistic tool that might help in the recovery or revitalisation of lost languages in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/linguafranca/2012-03-24/3903626 The Rosetta Project], Presented by Maria Zijlstra on Lingua Franca, 24 March 2012, ABC Radio National (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.longnow.org/02011/03/07/dr-laura-welcher-the-rosetta-project-the-language-commons/ Dr. Laura Welcher – The Rosetta Project &amp; The Language Commons], March 7th, 2011, by Austin Brown, Blog of the Long Now&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is creating this broad language archive through an open contribution, open review process similar to the strategy that created the original ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.  The resulting archive will be publicly available in three different media: a [[HD-Rosetta]] micro-etched [[nickel]] [[alloy]] disc three inches (7.62 cm) across with a 2,000 year life expectancy; a single volume monumental reference book; and a growing online archive. &lt;!-- I thought the metal was going to be [[Monel]]; did they change it, or did whoever write this not know the name/that we have an article on it? --&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:World population spoken languages.svg|thumb|200px|Fifty to ninety percent of the world's languages (in red) are predicted to disappear in the next century]]

Fifty to ninety percent of the world's languages are predicted to disappear in the next century, many with little or no significant documentation. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Much linguistic description, especially the description of languages with few speakers, remains hidden in personal research files or poorly preserved in under-funded archives.

As part of the effort to secure this critical legacy of linguistic diversity, the Long Now Foundation plans a broad online survey and near-permanent physical archive of 1,500 of the approximately 7,000 human languages.

The project has three overlapping goals:

# to create an unprecedented platform for comparative linguistic research and education
# to develop and widely distribute a functional linguistic tool that might help with the recovery of lost or compromised languages in unknown futures
# to offer an aesthetic object that suggests the immense diversity of human languages as well as the very real threats to the continued survival of this diversity

The 1,500-language [[corpus linguistics | corpus]] expands on the parallel-text structure of the original Rosetta Stone through archiving ten descriptive components for each of the 1,500 selected languages.

The goal is an [[Open-source software|open source]] "[[Linux]] of [[Linguistics]]"—an effort of collaborative online scholarship drawing on the expertise and contributions of thousands of academic specialists and native speakers around the world. The project is also organising formal archive research groups at [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], the American [[Library of Congress]], and the American [[SIL International|Summer Institute of Linguistics]] (and its offices in [[Dallas]]).

The resulting Rosetta archives are publicly available in three different media:

# a free and continually growing online archive, also available as a DVD;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interactive Disk |url=https://rosettaproject.org/disk/interactive/ |website=Rosettaproject.org |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# a single-volume monumental reference book;{{cn|date=June 2018}}
# an extreme-longevity micro-etched disc.

A "Version 1.0" of the [[HD-Rosetta]] disc was completed on November 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.longnow.org/2008/11/03/macro-to-micro-etching/ Macro to micro etching], November 3rd, 2008, by Alexander Rose, The Long Now Foundation's Blog&lt;/ref&gt; The disc contains over 13,000 pages of information using over 1,500 languages,&lt;ref name="weardisk"/&gt; which can be read after magnifying by 650 times with a microscope.

In early 2017, the Rosetta Wearable Disk was released.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blakemore |first1=Erin |title=This Necklace Contains All of the World’s Languages |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/necklace-contains-all-worlds-languages-180961876/ |website=Smithsonian.com (Smart News) |publisher=Smithsonian |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed using a similar manufacturing process as the first edition of the Rosetta Disk, the main difference being that the final archive is about 2 cm in diameter, thus enabling wearing as an ornament on the human body. One side has instructions in eight different languages and scripts (Bahasa Indonesia, English, Hindi, Mandarin, Modern Standard Arabic, Spanish, Swahili, and Russian), and the other an archive of over 1000 human languages assembled in 2016. By November 2017, the initial run of 100 disks had all been sold, but new releases are planned.&lt;ref name="weardisk"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rosetta Wearable Disk |url=https://rosettaproject.org/disk/wearable/ |website=The Rosetta Project: A Long Now Foundation Library of Human Language |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ScholarMatch''' is a [[San Francisco]]-based nonprofit organization that aims to make college possible for underserved youth by matching students with donors, resources, colleges, and professional networks.&lt;ref name="forum"&gt;{{cite news |title= ScholarMatch |work= Forum with Michael Krasny |author1= [[Michael Krasny (talk show host)|Michael Krasny]] |author2= Dave Eggers |author3=Miel Alegre |date= July 28, 2010  |publisher= [[KQED-FM]] |url=http://www.kqed.org/a/forum/R201007280931 |accessdate= June 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 2010 by best-selling author and philanthropist [[Dave Eggers]], ScholarMatch began as a scholarship crowdfunding platform and a project of 826 National. ScholarMatch became an independent 501(c)3 in 2012 and evolved into a full-service college access organization. ScholarMatch serves low-income, college-bound students, most of whom will be the first in their family to go to college, by providing college counseling, free online tools, scholarships, and support services all the way to college graduation. ScholarMatch has expanded rapidly from serving just 39 students in 2010 to working in-person with over 600 students per year, serving many more virtually, and awarding nearly one million in scholarship dollars.

== Overview ==
ScholarMatch's model champions low-income and first-generation students in the three critical areas: navigating the college admissions process, paying for school, and creating a support system in college. ScholarMatch is the only major nonprofit that combines a crowdfunded scholarship platform with game-changing college access and career support for low-income youth. ScholarMatch's typical student comes from a family earning less than $25,000 per year and attends a high school with just one counselor per 500-800 students. ScholarMatch's unique approach is fueled by community engagement and focused on what their students need most: hands-on help applying to college, financial assistance with tuition, and a support system throughout college.

== Programs ==
ScholarMatch programs include:
* '''Destination College:''' Providing transformative support to low-income students who have little to no guidance applying to college. Staff and trained volunteers work hands-on with high school students at ScholarMatch's drop-in center in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]], through partnerships with high schools, and online with virtual resources. Free services are open to any low-income student and include: 1-on-1 college coaching, weekly college access group workshops, individual financial aid counseling and FAFSA support, free ACT and SAT test preparation, college visits, parent meetings and more.
* '''Crowdfunded Scholarships:''' ScholarMatch's crowdfunded scholarship program matches donors with students who need their financial support. Nominated by local partners, ScholarMatch scholars maximize their financial aid and draw modest student loans, but still face a gap between their resources and the full cost of attendance. ScholarMatch's ‘last-dollar’ scholarships close this gap, averaging just $2,700 per student. In their sixth year of operation, ScholarMatch will have awarded over one million in scholarship dollars.
* '''College to Career:''' Providing support from freshman year all the way to college graduation and beyond. College to Career provides comprehensive transition and academic support, case management, and community building opportunities. On average, ScholarMatch students complete their freshman year of college with a 3.0 GPA. 90% of ScholarMatch college students persist, compared to the national average of 67% for students from similar backgrounds.

== ScholarMatcher ==
The [http://scholarmatcher.scholarmatch.org/ ScholarMatcher] is a free online tool created by ScholarMatch and launched in 2015 that revolutionizes the college search process for low-income students. This user-friendly tool is powered by analysis of thousands of college data points, yet instantly provides students with a curated list of excellent institutions. With just a few clicks, students can create a college application list full of schools that they are academically suited for and where they are most likely to thrive, even though many of these schools were previously unknown to them. The ScholarMatcher is easy to use and includes supplemental materials to help with the application process, perfect for students navigating this road on their own. The ScholarMatcher is used by students, high schools, and other community organizations across the country.

Using College Scorecard data and a formula created by ScholarMatch staff, over 1,400 colleges and universities across the country were scored on four areas to give them a "GPA" oh how well they do supporting low income students. Criteria looked at included financial aid, academic strength, student support services, and post-graduate success. Only schools that scored above a specific threshold are included in the ScholarMatcher tool, a list of schools referred to as the "College Honor Roll".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarmatch.org/college-honor-roll-is-here/|title=College Honor Roll is here!  {{!}}  ScholarMatch|website=scholarmatch.org|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, only 298 schools were included in the Honor Roll and ScholarMatcher.

A new version of the ScholarMatcher including a revised selection of colleges and universities and additional search and filter features will launch in the fall of 2016.

==Population Served==
ScholarMatch works with low-income and first-generation high school and college students. Each year, ScholarMatch serves over 600 students and gives out over $300,000 in scholarship dollars.

'''''Slaughter High''''' is a 1986 American-British [[slasher film]] directed and written by George Dugdale, [[Mark Ezra]] and [[Peter Litten]]. It stars [[Caroline Munro]], Simon Scudamore, Carmine Iannaconne, Donna Yeager, and Sally Cross. The story tells about a group of adults, formerly students who were responsible for a prank gone wrong on [[April Fool's Day]], invited to a reunion at their now defunct high school, where a killer in a jester mask awaits inside and begins to murder them one by one.

==Plot==
The day begins with popular student Carol Manning ([[Caroline Munro]]) jokingly asking school nerd Marty Rantzen (Simon Scuddamore) to have sex with her in the women's locker room. After he removes his clothes, Marty is surprisingly exposed to a group of students who tease him in several ways, including jabbing at his crotch with a javelin, giving him an electric shock, and dunking his head into a toilet bowl. This prank ends when the students's coach comes in to find out what is happening.

The students are forced to perform a vigorous workout in the gymnasium. Still, two students give Marty a marijuana joint laced with poison, which he smokes in the science lab where he is working on a chemistry project. The joint makes him so sick he runs to the men's room to vomit. While he is gone, one of the popular kids named Skip rigs the experiment to explode in Marty's face. Upon Marty's return, the set up works, causing Marty to panic and a great fire to erupt in the lab after he knocks over a Bunsen burner. In the struggle, Marty accidentally bumps into a shelf where a precariously placed jug of acid sits and causing the jug to fall and break, splashing acid on Marty's face and leaving him horribly disfigured. The sound attracts the attention of the students, who stand by the door in shock.

Years later, those behind the prank are mysteriously invited back to the school for a reunion. Upon arriving, they discover that the campus was closed years ago and the building is in disrepair and awaiting demolition. They begin to think that one of the former students was behind the invitations, but everyone denies it. They decide to break into the school to hang out and drink alcohol, then come across a room containing their old school lockers which, to their surprise, are filled with their old belongings. They notice Marty's old locker, and the alumni begin questioning what happened to him after the prank gone awry. Skip tells them that Marty has supposedly been kept in a mental institution.

Soon, the caretaker is killed onto a coat peg by a [[jester]] masked assailant. Soon thereafter, the friends begin dying in gruesome ways - Ted's stomach is melted from acid, Carl is impaled in the back inside a car, Shirley melts away in an acid bath, Susan arrives late and is attacked, Stella and Frank are electrocuted on a bed while having sex, and Joe is slaughtered by tractor blades. After all the deaths, Carol, Nancy and Skip, soon find that the bodies have disappeared. Skip is later hanged in a noose by the killer. Carol and Nancy investigate and find a room playing a video of Marty being bullied by them. Nancy runs off by herself and is chased by the Jester, where she falls into a cesspit and drowns. Carol is left alone and discovers Susan's body before being chased by the Jester inside the old school. In the process, Carol mistakenly kills a survived Skip with a hatchet. After a long run, Carol is ultimately impaled on a javelin pole, and the Jester is revealed to be Marty himself. After this, Marty sees the victims coming back as revenants and they attack him. He then awakes screaming, inside a mental hospital while restrained to a bed and wearing bandages on his face. While being checked on, Marty proceeds to strangle a nurse and dresses in her uniform before killing a doctor with a syringe in the eye. Vowing to actually get revenge, Marty turns to look into the camera and begins to tear off half of his face, before the screen fades to black.

===Critical response===
[[Kevin Thomas (film critic)|Kevin Thomas]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reviewed the film favorably, noting: "In its primitive way, ''Slaughter High'', is one of the better teen revenge horror pictures," adding that the film "benefits greatly from its authentic setting, a big, old derelict Tudor-style school building in a remote area, gets actually quite scary, yet the special effects are of the darkly comic, [[grand guignol|Grand Guignol]] variety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Thomas, Kevin|author-link=Kevin Thomas (film critic)|title='Slaughter High' Schock, Schlock in Good Form|date=May 12, 1987|p=8|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22968010/the_los_angeles_times/|via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry Lawson of the ''[[Dayton Daily News]]'' was critical of the performances, particularly the English actors' attempts at portraying an American accent, adding that the film "invites comment as much for its oddness as for its awfulness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Dayton Daily News]]|location=Dayton, Ohio|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22968241/dayton_daily_news/|date=February 14, 1987|p=20|via=Newspapers.com|author=Lawson, Terry|title='Slaughter High' flunks English I, wot?}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spiru Haret University''' is a private university in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], founded in 1991&lt;ref name=listaprofesorilor/&gt; by the president of Tomorrow's Romania Foundation, Aurelian Gh. Bondrea, as part of the teaching activities of this foundation.&lt;ref name=prezentare/&gt; The university claims this has been done according to the model used by [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=prezentare/&gt; The university bears the name of a scientist and reformer of the Romanian education, [[Spiru Haret]],&lt;ref name=prezentare/&gt; who lived before the [[World War I|Great War]].

On February 14, 2000, the university was accredited by the [[National Council of Academic Evaluation and Accreditation of Higher Education Institutions]]. The establishment of the university was confirmed by Law no. 443 of July 5, 2002&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdep.ro/pls/legis/legis_pck.htp_act_text?idt=36636 Legea nr. 443/2002] (see also Decree no. 611/July 4, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and this law has not been abolished.

According to the data published by the university in July 2010, it has 30 faculties with 49 specializations and 64 master's degree curricula,&lt;ref name=prezentare&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiruharet.ro/prezentare|title=Prezentarea Universitatii|author=Universitatea Spiru Haret|publisher=Universitatea Spiru Haret|accessdate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; being according to the newspaper ''Financiarul'' the largest university in Romania.&lt;ref name="financiarul"/&gt; In 2009 enrollment was reported as 311,928 students.&lt;ref name=listaprofesorilor/&gt; Referring to the number of its students, the newspaper mistakenly called it the [[World's largest universities|largest university in the world]].&lt;ref name="financiarul"/&gt; It is the second-largest private university in the world, after [[Islamic Azad University]] (with 1.3 million students).

[[Pope John Paul II]] and a former Romanian president, [[Ion Iliescu]], have received honorary doctorates from the university.&lt;ref name=prezentare/&gt;

In 2011, the Spiru Haret University was officially evaluated as an "education-centered university", which is the third and lowest educational quality category of the Romanian universities.&lt;ref name=florea&gt;Raul Florea, [http://www.gandul.info/news/clasificarea-universitatilor-vezi-aici-ce-universitati-vor-fi-axate-pe-licenta-masterat-si-doctorat-8704540 Clasificarea universităţilor.

Many of the Spiru Haret University graduates became successful in the fields of [[law]], [[education]], [[architecture]], [[banking]] and [[business]]. Most of the Romanian teachers, teaching in both private and public schools and one third of the registered lawyers in [[Romania]] are graduates of Spiru Haret University.

University culture in [[South Korea]] is different from that in other countries, consisting of events such as Student Orientation (OT) and Membership Training (MT), as well as [[festival]]s and student clubs.

[[File:Soongsil University Festival (Daedongje) 2010-10-06 12h25m.jpg|thumb|Soongsil University Festival (Daedongje) 2010-10-06 12h25m]]

== University culture in South Korea ==
In the early 1950s, development of South Korean University [[wikipedia:Culture|culture]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;was inhibited by the [[Korean War]]. At the time, the existence of universities and the lives of students had received many threats. Until the 1960s, the concept of university culture had not been used. After the war was over, universities regained stability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Around university towns, a unique and special culture unique to Korea has developed. South Korean university students usually enjoy doing activities in groups. For example, they would join a club such as dance, do volunteer work, study or travel, and spend a lot of time with other group members. The important aspect is that the student system is well developed and there are a lot of independent student organizations. The organizations host and manage many programs and events so that all students can enjoy university life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=The university culture in south korea|url=https://www.snu.ac.kr/about/snu60/pdfs/5_1.pdf|journal=journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the various university cultures, the typical examples are OT (Student Orientation), MT (Membership Training), School Festivals, and Clubs. Events and programs represent university culture in South Korea.

== Events ==
===  [[Student orientation|OT (Student Orientation)]]   ===
OT is the abbreviation for [[Student orientation|orientation]]. It is meant as an introduction for people so that they can understand the system and adapt to the new surroundings.

Nowadays it is generally known as a welcoming event for freshman.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Normally, the new lectures in the university start in March, but the university life of freshmen starts in February. There are a lot of events for freshmen held that month. For example, the welcoming event, classmate meeting, junior and senior meeting and so on. Among those things, the most important one is Orientation (a welcoming event). In this event, the freshman can not only make new friends and get to know the seniors, but also get some information about their classes and the university system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jobnjoy.com/portal/joylife/campus_life_view.jsp?nidx=198036&amp;depth1=2&amp;depth2=1&amp;depth3=3|title=[대학생 기자] 새내기들 어서와, 대학 생활은 처음이지?|website=캠퍼스 잡앤조이 - 즐겁게 놀고 성공 취업하자|language=en|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orientation runs for 2 or 3 days. The student organization rents a large resort and all the students spend time together. The schedule varies at each university. Usually, the orientation introduces the university system and classes, includes some fun games that all students can partake in, or drinking games for the nighttime. The university recommends that freshmen bring some less formal clothes, writing utensils, and washing tools.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

For 2 to 3 days, freshmen can meet thousands of new people including their classmates, seniors, and other different major students. This time is a chance to make a lot of friends very easily and enjoy university life. Otherwise, there aren't many other chances to meet and become friends with upperclassmen. Freshmen don't need to be shy and just need go and make friends! &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://punmedia.tistory.com/1649|title=신입생, 새터(OT) 준비하는 5가지 방법  "어서와~새터는 처음이지?"|date=2013-02-18|work=media|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Membership Training in Korea|MT (Membership Training)]] ===
[[File:Membership training in 2014.jpg|thumb|Membership training]]
MT is the abbreviation for [[Membership Training in Korea|Membership Training]]. It means all same major students from freshman to seniors spending time at same place promoting friendship and harmony.

April is the unofficial season of MT, one month after the beginning of the semester. April is very warm and a good month to do MT. It is one of the unique things about Korea's university culture that can't be seen in other university cultures. This is one of the aspects many exchange students from abroad appreciate about the Korean student life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.mt.co.kr/mtview.php?no=2016031018567457065&amp;outlink=1&amp;ref=https://search.naver.com|title=대학생 MT시즌, 대부도펜션시티로 떠나볼까 - 머니투데이 뉴스|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually MT runs for 3 days. Same as in the orientation event before, they get organized to rent a big space for all students of the same major.

The students spend the time cooking and eating food, sleeping and playing some games together. The schedule and program are managed by the student organization. They plan some events and games so that all students can join in and enjoy themselves. There are a lot of games like dodge ball, a speed quiz where the team that can answer the questions the fastest is winner and so on. At night, all the students get together and drink some beer, eat delicious food and play some drinking games.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

After 3 days, all the students may become close with each other. They also share some good tips for university life or on how to get good grades on the tests. If some text books that student need for class are too expensive, this time is a chance for freshmen to get the books from seniors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

While it may sound at first like an event that students go to just in order to play games and drink alcohol, it provides many good opportunities for students to meet their classmates, make new friends and develop a firmer sense of value about their major.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.snujn.com/news/1759|title=서울대저널 - 대학 엠티, 어디까지 왔나|date=2009-12-22|access-date=2017-06-09|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Festivals ==
=== Main festivals ===
[[File:Main festival in 2015.jpg|thumb|Main big festival]]
When it comes to 'Campus Romance', we can come up with festival. Festivals are named differently, depending on the university's character. Mostly it means all the students get together and have fun. The festival consists of many performances, exhibitions or flea markets.

The university festival's history dates back to 600 years ago. There were festivals in '[[Sungkyunkwan]]' which was the only national university in the [[Joseon Dynasty]] period. At that time, Sungkyunkwan's dormitory was opened and they permitted outsiders to come inside. Not only the students but also their parents, friends, and even relatives could participate in the festival and enjoy the many games and events.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the 1970s 'Mask dance', which is part of Korean traditional culture, was popular. Mask dance, Korean wrestling, and tug-of-war were the main events at university festivals. Also, traditional Korean performances or singing performances for political action had a role in the festival to criticize and satirize politics.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the 1980s, communal and cultural events like traditional performances, mask dance and tug-of-war were held at the festival called Daedongje which means 'become all-together'. Many academic seminars, mock trials and debates were also held. However, these festivals were sometimes delayed because of frequent demonstrations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the 1990s, many traditional and political things had disappeared from the festival. The events at the festivals had started consisting of celebrity invitation performances, bars, flea markets and so on. The culture started putting more importance on personality and diversity than on the value of community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the 2000s, most university festivals consist of many celebrity performances like Psy, Dynamic Duo, and IU. There are also a lot of bars set up by the students themselves. Not only the school's students but all university students in Korea can participate in and enjoy the festival. At night, some universities invite a club DJ and hold a DJ party.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theme.archives.go.kr/next/koreaOfRecord/uvFestival.do|title=The history of university festival|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, the university festivals are held in May for 3 days with many fantastic and enjoyable events.

=== Sub-festivals ===
There are sub-festivals organized by each department of a university. The festivals usually take place in the spring. The festivals include a range of events such as one-day pubs, quiz games and photo exhibitions.
Student dormitories also host student festivals. Gwanaksa, the Seoul National University dormitory, hosts the Hanul Festival at the beginning of each fall semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.useoul.edu/snunews?bm=v&amp;bbsidx=122285|title=The Gwanaksa Hanul Festival – A Valuable Opportunity For Cultural Exchange|last=|first=|date=October 5, 2015|website=SNU Media|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residential dormitory students can enjoy a night at the festival.
Student clubs usually take part in the main university festival, but rarely host their own festivals.

== Student Clubs ==
Many Korean students join one or more student clubs. Various kinds of student clubs are available to university students. There are volunteer associations, debate clubs, religious clubs, bands and many others. Club activities are an important part of student life in South Korea. Many universities run student clubs for foreign students as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng/university-clubs#none|title=University Clubs - Hanyang University|website=www.hanyang.ac.kr|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amateur orchestra clubs or student bands sometimes hold concerts for the students.

Most universities have a student association that engages with the university administration. Four members of the Student Association at [[Sungshin Women's University]] were suspended after raising concerns about monetary dealings made by the university's [[Shim Hwa-jin|president]], but their suspension was ruled as unfounded in student disciplinary action.&lt;ref name=kim2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2016/10/29/0200000000AKR20161029054000004.HTML?input=1195m|title='총장 비리의혹 제기' 성신여대 학생들, 징계 무효소송 승소|trans-title=Sungshin Women's students who raised 'suspicion of misconduct by the president' win disciplinary action|language=Korean|date=30 October 2016|access-date=27 April 2018|website=Yeonhap News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Many accidents occur during student orientation.

In 2014, nine people were reported dead after a collapsed roof trapped dozens of people at a South Korean university orientation. More than 70 students were injured following the roof collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/students-reported-dead-after-at-korean-university-roof-collapses-2014-2|title=Nine People Reported Dead After Collapsed Roof Traps Dozens At South Korean University Orientation|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a first-year female university student fell unconscious after drinking alcohol during a school-organised orientation event for newly enrolled students. She was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, but she remained unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/02/116_174294.html|title=Freshman unconscious after drinking at orientation session|date=2015-02-27|work=koreatimes|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bus driver died and 44 students were injured following a bus collapse in 2017. The bus was heading to [[Wonju]] for a school orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp?arcid=0011285417&amp;code=61121211&amp;sid1=soc|title="대학생 OT 하지 마라" 금오공대 관광버스 추락사고 ‘시끌’|website=news.kmib.co.kr|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cite book |last1=Council of Europe |year=2011 |title=''Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment''|publisher=Council of Europe|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/Cadre1_en.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; It examines four skills: speaking, listening, reading and writing. Examinations are currently available at five levels from Beginners 1 (A1) to Advanced 1 (C1) and are run internationally. In 2016 exams were held in Sydney, New York, Ottawa, and nationally in Ireland. There is the option for candidates at all levels to undertake the full examination (Lánchreidiúint) or just the oral examination (partial credit).
 
TEG is the first certification system for adult learners of Irish connected with the ALTE examination system / Council of Europe. It has previously developed such a system for the majority of other European languages. This system helps learners to plan their studies and gain recognition for the progress they have made. Another advantage of the system is that it gives educational institutions and employers on language ability of candidates for courses, jobs or promotions. Of particular importance to this since the provisions of the Official Languages Act (2003) in Ireland. The Language Centre in Maynooth is a member of ALTE ([[Association of Language Testers in Europe]]), monitors the content and quality of TEG.

[[Image:425tdd.JPG|thumb|300px|Miniprint 425 TDD. The [[acoustic coupler]] on the top is for use with telephone handsets. The printer records the conversation. The specific GA and SK keys allow for speedier use of common [[Telecommunications devices for the deaf#Etiquette|abbreviations]].]]

A '''telecommunications device for the deaf''' ('''TDD''') is a [[teleprinter]], an electronic device for text communication over a [[telephone]] line, that is designed for use by persons with [[hearing impairment|hearing]] or [[Speech disorder|speech difficulties]].  Other names for the device include '''[[teletypewriter]]''' ('''TTY'''), '''textphone''' (common in [[Europe]]), and '''minicom''' ([[United Kingdom]]).

The typical TDD is a device about the size of a typewriter or laptop computer with a [[QWERTY]] [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and small screen that uses an [[light-emitting diode|LED]], [[LCD]], or [[vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] screen to display typed text electronically. In addition, TDDs commonly have a small spool of paper on which text is also printed{{snd}}old versions of the device had only a printer and no screen. The text is transmitted live, via a telephone line, to a compatible device, i.e. one that uses a similar communication protocol.

Special telephone services have been developed to carry the TDD functionality even further.  In certain countries there are systems in place so that a deaf person can communicate with a hearing person on an ordinary voice phone using a human relay operator.  There are also "carry-over" services, enabling people who can hear but cannot speak ("hearing carry-over," a.k.a. "HCO"), or people who cannot hear but are able to speak ("voice carry-over," a.k.a. "VCO") to use the telephone.

The term TDD is sometimes discouraged because people who are deaf are increasingly using mainstream devices and technologies to carry out most of their communication.  The devices described here were developed for use on the partially-analog [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] (PSTN). They do not work well on the new [[Voice over IP|internet protocol (IP)]] networks.  Thus as society increasingly moves toward IP based telecommunication, the telecommunication devices used by people who are deaf will not be TDDs. In the US for example, the use of the term TDD is discouraged to avoid confusion with these partly-analog devices being referred to as TTYs.

[[Teletype]] Corporation, of Skokie, Illinois, made page printers for text, notably for news wire services and telegrams, but these used standards different from those for deaf communication, and although in quite widespread use, were technically incompatible. Furthermore, these were sometimes referred to by the "TTY" initialism, short for "Teletype". When computers had keyboard input mechanisms and page printer output, before CRT terminals came into use, Teletypes were the most widely used devices. They were called "console typewriters". (Telex used similar equipment, but was a separate international communication network.)

== History ==

=== APCOM acoustic coupler or MODEM device ===
The TDD concept was developed by [[James C. Marsters]] (1924–2009), a dentist and private airplane pilot who became deaf as an infant because of [[scarlet fever]], and [[Robert Weitbrecht]], a deaf physicist. In 1964, Marsters, Weitbrecht and Andrew Saks, an electrical engineer and grandson of the founder of the [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] department store chain, founded APCOM (Applied Communications Corp.), located in the San Francisco Bay area, to develop the [[acoustic coupler]], or [[modem]]; their first product was named the PhoneType.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;His Ingenuity Helped the Deaf Tap the Power of Telephones, Remembrances, Wall Street Journal, August 21, 2009, p. A9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/excerpts/POOOone6.html Gallaudet University, book excerpt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612122938/http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/excerpts/POOOone6.html |date=2010-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/us/23marsters.html?hpw|title=James Marsters, Deaf Inventor, Dies at 85|work=[[New York Times]]|date=2009-08-22|accessdate=2009-08-24 | first=Dennis | last=Hevesi}} 
]&lt;/ref&gt; APCOM collected old [[Teleprinter|teleprinter machines]] (TTYs) from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and junkyards. [[Acoustic coupler]]s were cabled to TTYs enabling the [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] standard [[Model 500 telephone]] to couple, or fit, into the rubber cups on the coupler, thus allowing the device to transmit and receive a unique sequence of tones generated by the different corresponding TTY keys.  The entire configuration of teleprinter machine, acoustic coupler, and telephone set became known as the TTY. Weitbrecht invented the acoustic coupler modem in 1964. The actual mechanism for TTY communications was accomplished electro-mechanically through [[frequency shift keying]] (FSK) allowing only [[half-duplex]] communication, where only one person at a time can transmit.

=== Paul Taylor TTY device ===
During the late 1960s, [[Paul Taylor (engineer)|Paul Taylor]] combined Western Union [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] machines with modems to create teletypewriters, known as TTYs. He distributed these early, non-portable devices to the homes of many in the deaf community in St. Louis, Missouri.  He worked with others to establish a local telephone [[Wake-up call (service)|wake-up service]].  In the early 1970s, these small successes in St. Louis evolved into the nation's first local telephone relay system for the deaf.&lt;ref name="cid_background"&gt;Readmond, Kim. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080704062727/http://cid.edu/home/NEWS%20ROOM/news%20releases/taylors.htm  "Paul and Sally Taylor Background Sheet,"] [[Central Institute for the Deaf]]; Lang, Harry G. (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=4bgvh1lTQwcC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Paul+Taylor++TTY&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TdA0WDfJ_0&amp;sig=w3vwWOY6Ddk1UqAP8w-H6URYcPU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wrngSsjMB4iylAe4rYzICw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Paul%20Taylor%20%20TTY&amp;f=false  ''A Phone of Our Own: the Deaf Insurrection Against Ma Bell,'' p. 67.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Micon Industries MCM device ===
In 1973, the Manual Communications Module (MCM), which was the world's first electronic portable TTY allowing two-way telecommunications, premiered at the California Association of the Deaf convention in Sacramento, California.  The battery-powered MCM was invented and designed by a deaf news anchor &lt;!-- -NEWSIGN 4 1971–1973,  (????) --&gt; and interpreter, Kit Patrick Corson, in conjunction with Michael Cannon and physicist Art Ogawa. It was manufactured by Michael Cannon's company, Micon Industries, and initially marketed by Kit Corson's company, Silent Communications. In order to be compatible with the existing TTY network, the MCM was designed around the five-bit [[Baudot code]] established by the older TTY machines instead of the ASCII code used by computers. The MCM was an instant success with the deaf community despite the drawback of a $599 cost. Within six months there were more MCMs in use by the deaf and hard of hearing than TTY machines. After a year Micon took over the marketing of the MCM and subsequently concluded a deal with [[Pacific Bell]] (who coined the term "TDD") to purchase MCMs and rent them to deaf telephone subscribers for $30 per month.

After Micon formed an alliance with APCOM, Michael Cannon (Micon), Paul Conover (Micon), and Andrea Saks (APCOM) successfully petitioned the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), resulting in a tariff that paid for TTY devices to be distributed free of cost to deaf persons. Micon produced over 1,000 MCMs per month, resulting in approximately 50,000 MCMs being disseminated into the deaf community.

Before he left Micon in 1980, Michael Cannon developed several computer compatible variations of the MCM and a portable, battery operated printing TTY, but they were never as popular as the original MCM. Newer model TTYs could communicate with selectable codes that allow communications at a higher bit rate on those models similarly equipped. However, the lack of true computer interface functionality spelled the demise of the original TTY and its clones. During the mid-1970s, other so-called portable telephone devices were being cloned by other companies, and this was the time period when the term "TDD" began being used largely by those outside the deaf community.

=== Marsters Award ===
In 2009, AT&amp;T received the James C. Marsters Promotion Award from TDI (formerly [[Telecommunications for the Deaf, Inc.]]) for its efforts to increase accessibility to communication for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.news.finance.yahoo.com/s/31072009/31/link-f-prnewswire-t-receive-james-c-marsters-promotion-award-helping.html Yahoo Canada Finance News, July 31, 2009, retrieved August 22, 2009]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The award holds some irony; it was AT&amp;T that, in the 1960s, resisted efforts to implement TTY technology, claiming it would damage its communication equipment.  In 1968, The [[Federal Communications Commission]] struck down AT&amp;T's policy and forced it to offer TTY access to its network.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

== Protocols ==
There are many different standards for TDDs and textphones.

=== Original 5-bit Baudot code ===
The original standard used by TTYs is a variant of the [[Baudot code]]. The maximum speed of this protocol is 10 characters per second.  This is a [[half-duplex]] protocol, which means that only one person at a time may transmit characters.  If both try to transmit at the same time, the characters will be garbled on the other end.

This protocol is commonly used in the [[United States]].

This is a variant of the Baudot code, implemented as 5-bits per character transmitted asynchronously using frequency shift key-modulation at either 45.5 or 50 baud, 1 start bit, 5 data bits, and 1.5 stop bits. Details of the protocol implementation are available in TIA-825-A&lt;ref name="TIA-825-A" /&gt; and also in T-REC V.18 Annex A "5-bit operational mode".&lt;ref name="T-REC-V.18_annexA" /&gt;

=== Turbo Code ===
The UltraTec company implements another protocol known as Enhanced TTY, which it calls "Turbo Code," in its products.  Turbo Code has some advantages over Baudot protocols, such as a higher data rate, full [[ASCII]] compliance, and [[full-duplex]] capability.  However, Turbo Code is [[Proprietary protocol|proprietary]], and UltraTec gives its specifications only to parties who are willing to license it, although some information concerning it is disclosed in {{US patent|5432837|US patent 5,432,837}}.

=== Other legacy protocols ===
Other protocols used for text telephony are European Deaf Telephone (EDT) and [[dual-tone multi-frequency signaling]] (DTMF).

The ITU V series recommendations are a collection of early modem standards approved by the [[ITU]] in 1988.

* [[ITU V.21]] [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-V.21/recommendation.asp?lang=en&amp;parent=T-REC-V.21-198811-I] specifies 300 bits per second duplex mode.
* [[ITU V.23]] [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-V/recommendation.asp?lang=en&amp;parent=T-REC-V.23] specifies [[audio frequency-shift keying]] modulation to encode and transfer data at 600/1200 bits per second.

=== V.18 ===
In 1994, the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] approved the V.18 standard, which comprises two major parts, a dual standard.&lt;ref name="T-REC-V.18"&gt;{{cite web|title=T-REC V.18|url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-V.18-200011-I/en|publisher=ITU-T|accessdate=1 March 2017|format=pdf|date=1 Nov 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is both an umbrella protocol that allows recognition and interoperability of some of the most commonly used textphone protocols, as well as offering a native V.18 mode, which is an [[ASCII]] full- or half-duplex modulation method.

Computers can, with appropriate software and modem, emulate a V.18 TTY.  Some voice modems, coupled with appropriate software, can now be converted to TTY modems by using a software-based decoder for TTY tones. Same can be done with such software using a computer's sound card, when coupled to the telephone line.

In the UK, a virtual V.18 network, called TextDirect, exists as part of the [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] (PSTN), thereby offering interoperability between textphones using different protocols. The platform also offers additional functionality like call progress and status information in text and automatic invocation of a relay service for speech-to-text calls.

=== Cell phones ===
Many digital cell phones are compatible with TTY devices.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ultratec.com/support/ttycell2.php "TTY Compatibility with Digital Cell Phones"].
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Jon Brodkin.
[https://arstechnica.com/business/2015/10/att-says-t-mobile-and-sprint-wi-fi-calling-violates-disability-rules/ "AT&amp;T says T-Mobile and Sprint Wi-Fi calling violates disability rules"].
2015.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people want to replace TTY with [[Text over IP|real-time text over IP]] (RTT), which can be used on a digital cell phone or tablet without a separate TTY device.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=60001323608 "Reply comments of consumer groups on petitions of AT&amp;T regarding the substitution of real-time text for text telephone technology"].
2015.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New technologies ===
As TDDs are increasingly considered [[Legacy system|legacy]] devices, with the emergence of modern technologies such as [[email]], [[texting]] and [[instant messaging]], text from TDD are increasingly being sent over [[Text over IP]] gateways, or other [[real-time text]] protocols.  However, these newer methods require IP connections and will not work with regular analog phone lines, unless a data connection is used (i.e. [[dial-up Internet]], or the [[modem]] method of multiplexing text and voice that is done on a [[Captioned Telephone]] hardware handset).  Because some people have no access to any kind of data connection, and it is not even available in some parts within many countries, TTYs are still the only method for analog landline text phone calls, although TTYs include any device with a suitable modem and software.

== Other devices for the deaf or hard of hearing ==
[[Image:Jrb 20080809 att tdd 2700.jpg|thumb|150px|AT&amp;T TDD 2700]]

In addition to TDD, there are a number of pieces of equipment that can be coupled to telephones to improve their utility. For those with hearing difficulties the telephone ring and conversation sound level can be amplified or pitch adjusted, ambient noise can also be filtered. The amplifier can be a simple addition or through an inductive coupler to interact with suitable hearing aids. The ring can also be supplemented with extension bells or a visual call indicator.

== Etiquette ==
There are some etiquette rules that users of TTYs must be aware of. Because of the inability to detect when a person has finished speaking, (and the fact that two people typing will scramble the text on both ends) the term "Go Ahead" (GA) is used to denote the end of a turn, and an indication for the other person to begin typing.

''Note: TTYs use only [[capital letter]]s except when there are computer screens.'' &lt;br&gt;
''Note: In the UK, Text relay service used to be called typetalk (RNID) but have since merged with the phone line using the dialling prefix 18001 (TTY) or the 18002 (voice relay). The emergency line is 18000 (TTY).

== TRS relay ==
One of the most common uses for a TTY is to place calls to a [[Telecommunications Relay Service]] (TRS), which makes it possible for the deaf to successfully make phone calls to users of regular phone systems.

The voice recognition systems are in limited use, due to problems with the technology.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}  A new development called the [[captioned telephone]] now uses voice recognition to assist the human operators.  Newer text-based communication methods, such as [[short message service]] (SMS), [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), and [[instant messaging]] have also been adopted by the deaf as an alternative or adjunct to TTY.

'''''The Forbidden Education''''' ({{lang-es|La Educación Prohibida}}) is an independent documentary released in 2012. The film documents diverse [[alternative education]] practices and unconventional schools in Latin America and Spain and includes educational approaches such as [[popular education]], [[Montessori education|Montessori]], [[progressive education]], [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]], [[homeschooling]].

It became the first released movie in Spanish to be funded under a [[Crowd funding|crowdfunding]] methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publico.es/culturas/440901/la-educacion-prohibida-se-libera-en-todo-el-mundo |title='La educación prohibida' se libera en todo el mundo &amp;#124; Diario Público |publisher=Publico.es |date=2012-08-12 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also highlighted by its distributed screening proposal that enabled a synchronized release in 130 cities in 13 countries with a total number of 18,000 viewers in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cba24n.com.ar/content/hoy-se-estrena-la-pel-cula-la-educaci-n-prohibida |title=Hoy se estrena la película "La Educación prohibida" |publisher=cba24n |date= |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.co/blogs/la-educacion-prohibida |title=La Educación Prohibida |publisher=El Universal |date=2012-08-14 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week after its release, the movie was viewed almost 2 millions times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.mdphoy.com/presentaron-el-documental-la-educacion-prohibida-64506/ |title=Presentaron el documental "La educación Prohibida" |publisher=mdphoy.com |date=2014-05-16 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educacionprohibida.com/a-una-semana-del-estreno-mundial/ |title=A una semana del estreno mundial &amp;#124; La Educación Prohibida |publisher=Educacionprohibida.com |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Thomas Weihs''' (born 30 April 1914 [[Vienna]] (then the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]), died 19 June 1983 [[Aberdeen]], Scotland) was a doctor, farmer and special needs educator, one of the founders and leading co-workers of the [[Camphill Movement]] and a pioneer of Anthroposophical curative education.&lt;ref&gt;‘’The Builders of Camphill: Lives and Destinies of the Founders’’ Edited by Friedwart Bock, Article by Christine Polyblank, Floris Books, 2004 {{ISBN|9780863154423}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=759 ‘’Thomas Weihs’’ – Biographischer Eintrag in der Online-Dokumentation der anthroposophischen ''Forschungsstelle Kulturimpuls'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Thomas Johannes Weihs was the second child of Gertrude and Richard Weiss (spelling later changed), who had settled in Vienna from [[Brody]] in the [[Ukraine]]. During his studies in Medicine at the [[University of Vienna]], he met Dr [[Karl König]] and became part of a youth group whose members formed the core of what was to become [[Camphill Movement|Camphill]] in Scotland.

Being of Jewish origin, he fled Austria together with his first wife, Helene Stoll, completed his doctor's degree in [[Basel]], after which, at the outbreak of [[World War II]] he joined Dr König and the others in Scotland. Near Aberdeen, on Camphill estate, they founded the work in curative education for those they called "children in need of special care," which was to occupy him for the rest of his life. He had a number of children with Helene, one of whom, Christine Polyblank, founded the [[Ringwood Waldorf School]].

As Camphill grew, so his responsibilities increased, ranging from farming and general handyman to doctor, educator, lecturer and writer. In 1957 he was appointed Superintendent of the Camphill work by Dr König. He had, by this time, also established a thriving practice as a doctor, including working at Dr. König's own London practice. At the same time he travelled widely, lecturing at Camphill centres throughout the world as well as to the general public. It was in this manner that he met [[BBC]] film director [[Jonathan Stedall]], then 28 and taking a year off to study at [[Emerson College UK|Emerson College]]. Their collaboration led to the numerous films for British television that Stedall made on Camphill such as "Candle on the Hill".

Weihs’ best-known work, the book ''Children in Need of Special Care'', was published in 1971 and has since been reprinted on several occasions and translated into 14 languages.

His final work,  "Embryogenesis in Myth and Science", was completed on his deathbed and published posthumously.

Besides this, his work as sculptor led to a considerable number of pieces set up all over the various farms and public buildings of Camphill.

'''University charter''' is a [[charter]] given by [[Province|provincial]], [[State (administrative division)|state]], [[regional]], and sometimes [[nation]]al governments to legitimize the university's existence.

==Canada==
In most [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]]s university charters are in the form of '''Acts''' (e.g. York University Act). "The Royal Military College of Canada Degrees Act" of 1959 enables the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]] to offer degrees in [[Arts]], [[Science]], and [[Engineering]] at the [[undergraduate]] and [[graduate student|graduate]] levels.
*Algoma University Act, 2008, S.O. 2008, c. 13

*University of Ontario Institute of Technology Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 8, Sched. O 2   &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.search.e-laws.gov.on.ca/en/search/#LegalAdvice ServiceOntario E-laws]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

===Federal===

In the United States, [[American University]], [[Gallaudet University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Howard University]], and [[George Washington University]] are the only Congressionally chartered universities, due to their location within the [[District of Columbia|US's federal district]].

The [[United States service academies|United States service (military) academies]] are not chartered as they are agencies of the federal government itself.

===State===
Other universities are chartered by the colonial governments or by state legislatures.

'''Vernor Steffen Vinge''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Vernor Vinge.ogg|ˈ|v|ɜr|n|ər|_|ˈ|v|ɪ|n|dʒ|iː}}; born October 2, 1944) is an American [[science fiction author]] and retired professor. He taught mathematics and [[computer science]] at [[San Diego State University]]. He is the originator of the [[technological singularity]] concept and perhaps the first to present a fictional "[[cyberspace]]".{{Fact|date=November 2018}} He has won the [[Hugo Award]] for his novels and novellas ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]'' (1992), ''[[A Deepness in the Sky|A&amp;nbsp;Deepness in the Sky]]'' (1999), ''[[Rainbows End]]'' (2006), ''[[Fast Times at Fairmont High]]'' (2002), and ''[[The Cookie Monster (novella)|The Cookie Monster]]'' (2004).

==Life and work==
Vinge published his first short story, "[[Bookworm, Run!]]", in the March 1966 issue of ''[[Analog Science Fiction]]'', then edited by [[John W. Campbell]]. The story explores the theme of artificially augmented intelligence by connecting the brain directly to computerised data sources. He became a moderately prolific contributor to SF magazines in the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1969, he expanded the story "Grimm's Story" (''[[Orbit (anthology series)|Orbit 4]]'', 1968) into his first novel, ''[[Grimm's World]]''. His second novel, ''[[The Witling]]'', was published in 1975.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Vinge came to prominence in 1981 with his novella ''[[True Names]]'', perhaps the first story to present a fully fleshed-out concept of [[cyberspace]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Saffo|first=Paul|editor-last=Denning|editor-first=Peter J.|contribution=Consensual Realities in Cyberspace|doi=10.1145/102616.102644|isbn=0-201-53067-8|location=New York, NY|pages=416–20|publisher=ACM|title=Computers Under Attack: Intruders, Worms, and Viruses|year=1990}}. Revised and expansed from "Viewpoint", [[Communications of the ACM]] 32 (6): 664–65, 1989,{{doi|10.1145/63526.315953}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which would later be central to [[cyberpunk]] stories by [[William Gibson]], [[Neal Stephenson]] and others. His next two novels, ''[[The Peace War]]'' (1984) and ''[[Marooned in Realtime]]'' (1986), explore the spread of a future [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] society, and deal with the impact of a technology which can create impenetrable [[Force field (science fiction)|force fields]] called '[[Stasis (fiction)|bobbles]]'. These books built Vinge's reputation as an author who would explore ideas to their logical conclusions in particularly inventive ways. Both books were nominated for the [[Hugo Award]], but lost to novels by [[William Gibson]] and [[Orson Scott Card]].&lt;ref name=WWE-1985/&gt;&lt;ref name=WWE-1987/&gt;

Vinge won the Hugo Award (tying for Best Novel with ''[[Doomsday Book (novel)|Doomsday Book]]'' by [[Connie Willis]]) with his 1992 novel, ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]''.&lt;ref name=WWE-1993/&gt; ''[[A Deepness in the Sky]]'' (1999) was a [[prequel]] to ''Fire'', following competing groups of humans in The Slow Zone as they struggle over who has the rights to exploit a technologically emerging alien culture. ''Deepness'' won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2000.&lt;ref name=WWE-2000/&gt;

His novellas ''[[Fast Times at Fairmont High]]'' and ''[[The Cookie Monster (novella)|The Cookie Monster]]'' also won Hugo Awards in 2002 and 2004, respectively.&lt;ref name=WWE-2002&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=2002|title=2002 Award Winners &amp; Nominees|work=Worlds Without End|accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WWE-2004&gt;

Vinge's 2006 novel ''[[Rainbows End]]'', set in the same universe and featuring some of the same characters as ''Fast Times at Fairmont High'', won the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Novel.&lt;ref name=WWE-2007/&gt; In 2011, he released ''[[Children of the Sky|The Children of the Sky]]'', a sequel to ''A Fire Upon the Deep'' set approximately 10&amp;nbsp;years following the end of ''A Fire Upon the Deep''.&lt;ref name=Norwescon33&gt;

'''''You Suck At Photoshop''''' is a series of online [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] tutorials with adult-themed humor designed by Matt Bledsoe and Troy Hitch of the Big Fat Institute for Advanced Interactive Design; hosted at [[My Damn Channel]].&lt;ref name=time/&gt; The show started as a one-off parody of instructional videos and became popular almost overnight; since its debut in December 2007, the first episode alone has received over 4.7 million views on [[YouTube]], over 600,000 on My Damn Channel, and garnered national attention in [[Time Magazine]].&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

==Show format and subject matter==

Episodes typically star fictional Photoshop user Donnie Hoyle, who demonstrates tools and techniques in Photoshop, usually on a [[Macintosh|Macintosh computer]]. Donnie is a person with severe and chronic personal problems relating to his job, his relationships and disintegrating marriage; various legal problems, career and emotional problems; which tend to weave themselves into the narrative to dark comedic effect. Each episode's title card is further distinguished by a different misspelling which can be interpreted as part of the joke of each episode or is spelled so as to suggest an [[Off-color humor|off-color reference]]. Further clues to Donnie's state of mind can probably be inferred from the ever-changing desktop wallpaper seen during the demonstration.

Despite Donnie's rather intractable life problems, he does manage to demonstrate Photoshop CS3 tools and techniques, such as selecting via Color Range, Curves, and Vanishing Point.

Originally intended as a one-off series, ''YSAP'' went into a second season due to fan demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/06/demented-photos.html |title=Wired Blog "Fan Demand Resuscitates You Suck at Photoshop" by Jenna Wortham |accessdate=2008-11-04 | date=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series went into its second season on My Damn Channel on 27 June 2008, and ended on 31 October 2008. The series has had two spinoffs, a five-episode My Damn Channel series known as ''Sn4tchbuckl3r's Second Chance'', and ''You Suck At Photoshop (TOP SECRET EDITION!)'', in which Donnie creates his Photoshop [[will (law)|will]].

The series restarted unofficially on 4 April 2012 with a spinoff called You Rock At Photoshop, starring Ronnie Cox. On 25 April 2012, the official start of You Suck At Photoshop started.

==Awards==
The series was awarded two [[Webby Award|Webby awards]]; for Best How-To and Best Comedy Series – People's Voice.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webbyawards.com/press/press-release.php?id=152 |title=Winners of 12th Annual Webby Awards Announced |accessdate=2008-09-03  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also won the [[Streamy Awards|Streamy award]] for Best Artistic Concept in a Web Series.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.streamys.org/go/winners/|title=Winners of the 2009 Streamy Awards|accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
* '''Donnie Hoyle''' (voiced by Troy Hitch) is the series' main character, tutor, and victim.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; Starting the series as an unhappily married man, desperately unhappy in his job as dumping manager of a waste-management company called Phebco, he relieves stress by making video tutorials of an application he is a master of – [[Adobe Photoshop CS3]]. He is so angry, though, that he cannot help but let his discontent over his strife-laden marriage, lack of accomplishment and contempt toward other people who don't know Photoshop as well show through. He suffers from self-hatred and bottled up emotions, which he tries to remedy by making tutorials. He's fighting a losing battle against his lifestyle and typically takes it out on the viewer through scornful comments and sarcasm. His friends betray him, and many plan to kill him, such as Sandy and Sn4tchbuckl3r. At the end of the second season finale, Donnie is apparently shot by an unknown assailant.

The creators of the character have this to say about him, from their ''Time'' magazine profile:&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1736726,00.html |title=TIME Magazine Profile "Fun With Photoshop" by Josh Quittner |accessdate=2008-09-03 | work=Time | date=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Hitch and Bledsoe had long nurtured an idea for a character they thought of as the Angry Photoshop Guy. Explains Bledsoe: "We had both been in the agency business so long that after a while we'd seen every kind of person in the advertising world." One of those stereotypes, he says, was the "insane designer, basically. He has horrible social skills and horrible things going on in his life, and the only thing he has going for him is he can out-Photoshop the guy in the cube next to him}}

* '''Sn4tchbuckl3r''' (voiced by Matt Bledsoe) is the series' major recurring supporting character, and appears to be Donnie's closest friend and a regular co-player of [[World of Warcraft]]. He speaks with what appears to be a Hispanic accent, and both taunts Donnie and seems to also function as his only friendly contact with the world at large. His speech is characterized by what would otherwise be expletives that are cleverly replaced by similarly sounding words (e.g. ''What the Schmidt!'')
* '''Sandy Mehglich''' (unvoiced) is Donnie's internet divorce-rebound love-interest, the next most important recurring character. She is a prominent plot feature in episodes 7, 8, and 9 from the first season, and 16 from the second. She was introduced to Donnie through a request to "hot-up" her Facebook picture to appeal to, as she put it, "college-boy beef loaf". Sandy is also encumbered by two adult children who were, through apparently some sort of prolonged physical abuse involving coffee and special restrictive unitards, stunted to about 65% of normal growth and attempt to make a living as semi-professional go-cart drivers, whom Sandy, out of necessity, manages. In contrast to the other characters who are known only by their voices, Sandy is only known by her (rather flawed) face, a Facebook message to Donnie and her Facebook chat session (where she was in an adjoining room) while Donnie was demonstrating brush settings in episode 16.

Additional uncredited characters include Donnie's wife (usually heard heckling him in the early episodes), and Donnie's co-workers at Phebco (heard when he had to do a couple of tutorials from his workplace after legal trouble during his divorce caused him to be locked out of his house).

Season One of ''You Suck at Photoshop'' was presented on [[My Damn Channel]] every other week from 21 December 2007 through 4 April 2008. It comprises 10 regular episodes and one season-ending tribute episode. Donnie's life and career trajectory during this series begin with his portrayal as a man who is both desperately unhappy in his job and his marriage, the progress of his life through is divorce and the loss of his job (whether by firing or quitting is not made clear), and his failed attempt to forge another relationship prior to his rather mysterious disappearance at the end of episode 10.

* ''Episode One – You Suck at Photoshop: Distort, Warp and Layer Effects'': Donnie uses distort and warp to paste a copy of his marriage license over the driver's side of the van in which his wife was conducting a certain infidelity.

The liquefy tool is demonstrated, showing how one might gradually distort an object to enlarge it. Not for the squeamish.

Released 4 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mydamnchannel.com/Big_Fat_Brain/You_Suck_at_Photoshop__Season_1/YouSuckAtPhotoshop10_615.aspx Episode Ten - You Suck At Photoshop: Vanishing Point]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the episode we see Sn4tchbuckl3r logging into a new site: Peopleburg. This episode referred to a sidebar on the My Damn Channel site which he ostensibly "hacked" to allow download of the train track landscape seen in Episode 10 as well as a way to upload graphics as part of a Donnie tribute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mydamnchannel.com/You_Suck_at_Photoshop/Season_1/YouSuckAtPhotoshopADonnieHoyleTributebysn4tchbuckl3r_1408.aspx Season-ending Tribute Episode - A Donnie Hoyle Tribute by Sn4tchbuckl3r]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season two===
Season Two debuted on My Damn Channel on 27 June 2008, with episode #11, and new episodes being released once every other week on Friday. As before, Donnie is at war with his lifestyle and the results of the life choices he's made. Despite his apparent sojourn to Peopleburg (as detailed in the short series ''[[Sn4tchbuckl3r's Second Chance]]'' and the placidity of his attitude in episode #10, he is just as stressed and anxious as he was before. The trajectory of this season starts with a losing paternity battle, the losing of which incites Donnie to do something incredibly stupid involving Thai thumb drives and a [[NERF]] [[lawn dart|jart]] that invoking Stephen Baldwin can't even save him from, and an apparent cross-country flight from Ricky (aka. the guy "drilling" his wife in the Vanagon in episode 1). Sna4tchbuckl3r and Sandy make returns to the storyline.

*''You Suck at Photoshock: Smart Objects'': in this episode, Donnie demonstrates the use of Smart Objects and how they can make changing multiple copies of a placed images quick and efficient. He does this in order to demonstrate that a certain child is not actually his. This marked the beginning of the "Don't Download Ronnie" campaign, in which viewers were negatively encouraged not to download a picture of a sperm cell, nicknamed Ronnie in the video lesson, and not to use it in a Photoshop mashup, which would then be posted to a fan gallery at My Damn Channel. Released 27 June 2008.
* ''Episode 12 – You Suck at Protoshop: Measurement Log'': In this episode, Donnie explores his daddy issues (and, notably, has the scene from [[Star Wars]] where Luke finally confronts Darth Vader as his father) with Measurement Log, a tool so obscure that Donnie claims not even the Photoshop developers know it's there. By comparing a photo of himself as a child and his father as an infant Donnie hopes to "measure up" favorably; Measurement Log allows one-click recording of measurements and exporting of those measurements. The result is less than Donnie had hoped for. Along with more pleas not to download Ronnie, this episode was released on 11 July 2008.
* ''Episode 13 - You Phuck at Sotoshop: Displacement'': Donnie's courtroom technique leads to tears ... but with Displacement, which can create a map of the texture of the surface, and can map letters realistically onto a wrinkled soccer jersey, Donnie can live the dream digitally. Released 25 July 2008.
* ''Episode 14 - You Suck at Photosho: Video Stuff Reall Fast'': Donnie Hoyle is in trouble. After being implicated in a crime (of passion) involving the theft of $70,000 worth of Thai thumb drives and a Nerf jart, Donnie doesn't have time to show you how to use the video features of Photoshop CS3, while he attempts to edit himself out of ten seconds of video camera footage. Released 8 August 2008.
* ''Episode 15 - You Suck at Phatoshop: Define Pattern'': Donnie has had to skip town fast, and is hiding out in a long-stay motel in an undisclosed location. Everything would be tolerable, however, if it wasn't for the human keg-tapping against the bed wall in the next room. Today, Donnie is going to solve his problems with Photoshop, and show you how to create an infinite soundproofing texture using the Define Pattern tool. This episode features the return of Sn4tchbuckl3r. Released 22 August 2008.
* ''Episode 16 - You Suck at Photoshop: Define Brush Preset'': Still on the run, Donnie has ended up hiding with Sandy and the littlekins, where a freak accident involving some dangerous growth hormones has changed her...a bit. Donnie hides out in the second room and tries to blow off some steam with Photoshop, showing you the best way to define interesting brush presets. Released 25 August 2008.
* ''Episode 17 - You Suck at Photoshart: Automate: Photomerge]'': The beginning of this episode reveals that Donnie has moved out of Sandy's house, and has apparently stolen some data that he's left on USB Flash Drives, which have been left in different locations around his home city (which is revealed in this episode to be [[Covington, Kentucky]]). Donnie uses the Photomerge feature of Photoshop to compile a map of the flash drive's locations, which he then sends on to Sn4tchbuckl3r to recover. Released 19 September 2008.
* ''You Suck At Photoshop Season 2 Sn4tchbuckl3r PSA'': Having not found the drives Donnie located on the map for him, Sn4tchbuckl3r produces an appeal to honesty – that of Donnie, who may not have been honest about where the drives were stashed, or any "Covington area bottom-feeders" who may have beaten him to the drives and taken them to put them up for auction on eBay. The video opens with test color bars and the caption '''''Sn4tchbuckl3r PSA/Peopleburg Liberation Front Communication Network''''', and displays a Peopleburg in flames, the sky filled with billowing red clouds. Even Sn4tch himself seems the worse for wear. An actual drive was put on auction on eBay with Sn4tchBuckl3r's name on the back which matched his description. The auction has since ended. Released 26 September 2008.
* ''Episode 18 - You Suck at Phodioshop: Annotations'': Donnie explains how to use the text and audio annotation tools by responding to a threat letter he found on his door. The letter informs him he has until the end of the month to leave the person's house. Released 10 October 2008.
* ''Episode 19 - You Sulk at Photoshop: Shadows and Light'': Donnie starts this video by opening a photo he has made entirely in photoshop that illustrates the mysery and light in his life. He talks about the "Ring of Infinite Sorrows" (which is coincidentally the name of the guild created in Peopleburg to take out the current authority and also the ring in episode 4 that Donnie removes) and how the ring has changed his life. Near the end of the video, Donnie calls Sn4tchbuckl3r for the first time to inform Sn4tch that has broken their trust by letting the thumb drives get in the hands of people who put the files on the internet. Donnie then shuts down Peopleburg through a script in Photoshop, and the last thing that can be heard from Sn4tchbuckl3r is, "I'm going to kill you Donnie Hoyle. I'm going to kill you." At the very end of the video, Donnie zoom in on the photo to see an old man staring at him through one of the castle windows (similar to the end of Episode 15). Released 17 October 2008.
* ''Episode 20 - You Sucjk at Photoshop: Distort, Warp, &amp; Layer Effects'': Donnie talks about how the past things he has done in Photoshop all were chain reactions that got started by the very first episode. He informs Ricky that he is sorry, and to "enjoy my wife." As he is putting the message on the car's driver side window, another voice tells Donnie that they are going to kill him. The mysterious voice is masked using a phaser and a pitch change. A picture of the actor who voices Donnie can be seen in the background. Many clues are revealed as to who the killer is, but they all lead to many different people. At the very end of the video, Donnie says, My name is Donnie...", a gunshot is heard, and then the camera cuts to [[Dane Cook]], wounded and saying in the voice of Donnie, "...and you suck at Photoshop." There is a small reference to Dane Cook in the second episode of the series. Released 31 October 2008.

=== Season Three===
As of 4 April 2012, My Damn Channel has started showing You Suck At Photoshop series, beginning with an offshoot series called You Rock At Photoshop, starting 4-year-old Ronnie Cox, the possible estranged child of Donnie Hoyle. The offshoot series tends to mimic the original in a happier tone voiced by little Ronnie. Following the first episode, two videos affidavits by Robert Davis-Brockweilder Munghj, the legal representative of the "late" Donnie Hoyle estate, notifying My Damn Channel that they were in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for the blatant copy.

The second episode of the You Rock At Photoshop started the same as the second episode of You Suck At Photoshop, but involving removing a robot instead of a cat. During the video, Ronnie Cox received a Skype message from Robert Davis-Brockweilder Munghj regarding how Robert was just attacked by a horde of 4-year-old children which he believed were sent to attack him by Ronnie. During the Skype call, you could hear a group of 4-year-olds breaking into the room where Robert was.

There was a third affidavit by Robery Davis-Brockweilder Munghj, where he appeared beaten, bounded and his head was covered. In this video he made mention that Donnie Hoyle was alive and he would return. Soon after, the sounds of 4-year-olds entering the room and attacking Robert occurred.

On 25 April 2012, the third season of You Suck At Photoshop started, with Donnie Hoyle creating an advertisement for Robert Davis-Brockweilder Munghj as payment for his services.
