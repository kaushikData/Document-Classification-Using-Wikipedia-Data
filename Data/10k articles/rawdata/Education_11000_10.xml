The '''Albert Academy (AA)''' is a [[High school|secondary school]] in [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]].

The school's motto is ''Esse Quam Vederi'' (Rather to be than to Seem). It is situated at Berry Street in Freetown. Among its alumni are Sierra Leone's first [[Prime Minister]], Sir [[Milton Margai]] and Sierra Leone's first president, [[Siaka Stevens]] and Chernor Bah.

The school is sometimes referred to as '''Mende Man College''' reflecting the fact that over the years students from the [[Mende tribe]] in Sierra Leone were overrepresented. AA students have also been referred to as '''Okamory Boys''' due to the area in which the school is located in Freetown. However, the school has students from everywhere in Sierra Leone and it is not restricted to any tribe.

Although the school has a Christian tradition, the [[United Methodist Church]], students from all religious background can attend. It has [[alumni association]]s in the UK, USA and Freetown. The alumni associations make contributions to the school including, for example, giving scholarships and grants to students.

== History ==
A girls' school had been established in the [[British Colonial Empire|British]] colony of [[Sierra Leone Colony|Sierra Leone]] in [[Moyamba]] in 1900,{{sfn|Caulker-Burnett|2010|p=75}} and it was decided to establish a similar boys' school.{{sfn|Caulker-Burnett|2010|p=76}} The UBC mission was responsible for finding land for the school, and originally proposed locating it in [[Shenge]], the home of missionary [[Ira Albert]].{{sfn|Caulker-Burnett|2010|p=77}} Eventually, however, the board decided that Shenge was too small, so they established the school in the colony's capital at [[Freetown]].{{sfn|Caulker-Burnett|2010|p=77}}

The Albert Academy was founded on 4 October 1904, and was named after Ira Albert, who had recently been killed in a boating accident.&lt;ref name="BriefHistory"&gt;{{cite web |author=Albert Academy |title=A brief history of the school by Philip Johnson |url=http://albertacademy.org.uk/?page_id=32 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the academy was founded, it had just one teacher, a Mr L Turner, and four pupils.&lt;ref name="BriefHistory"/&gt; The first principal was Reverend Raymond P. Dougherty, with Edwin Hursh as vice principal.{{sfn|Caulker-Burnett|2010|p=77}} The original location was in Freetown's East Street.&lt;ref name="BriefHistory"/&gt;

In 1907, the academy relocated to its present location on Berry Street.&lt;ref name="BriefHistory"/&gt;

==Notable alumni==
*[[Sir]] [[Milton Margai]], lead Sierra Leone to independence and became prime minister from 1961-1964
* Siaka Stevens, First Executive President

==Biography==
Reynolds Brown was born on October 16, 1952, in [[Sumter, South Carolina]]. Her parents are Sadie, a schoolteacher, and the late Whittimore Reynolds, who worked in construction. She is the oldest of seven children.

After graduating from the [[Philadelphia High School for Girls]] in 1970, Reynolds Brown earned a [[bachelor’s degree]] in Elementary Education in 1974 and a Master of Science in Education with a focus on counseling and guidance in 1975, both from [[Penn State University]]. That year she began teaching elementary school in the [[School District of Philadelphia]].

In 1976, Reynolds Brown began a career as a professional dancer, ultimately earning a place as a professional company member of the [[Philadelphia Dance Company]], also known as Philadanco.  Following her company membership, she would continue her affiliation with Philadanco, becoming a dance instructor and later a board member for 20 years.

From 2002–2005 Reynolds Brown served as a national [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] fellow in the area of Urban Health Initiatives providing an intensive learning experience in planning and implementing strategic and innovative policy system changes for children, youth and families.  She is also a graduate of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s Community Leadership Program and the Philadelphia Urban League Leadership Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blondellonline.com/bio.htm| title=Biography – Councilwoman Blondell Reynolds Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She currently resides with her family in Philadelphia’s [[Wynnefield]] section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex=203| title=Blondell Reynolds Brown Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
From 1982 to 1986, Reynolds Brown served as a committee person for the Third Division of Philadelphia’s 24th Ward, beginning her career in politics. In 1991, she was hired as [[legislative director]] for then Pennsylvania State Senator and current Congressman [[Chaka Fattah]].  She went on to serve as Community Affairs Director for State Senator [[Vincent Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex=203| title=Blondell Reynolds Brown Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics Board Settlement==
On September 21, 2011 the City of Philadelphia Ethics Board entered into an agreement with the campaign ''Friends of Blondell Reynolds Brown'', which was signed and agreed to by City Councilwoman Blondell Reynolds Brown.  Some contributions were not reported in a timely way on finance disclosure forms and numerous donations were over legal limits. In January 2013, Brown was again fined by the ethics board for campaign finance violations dating back to 2010,&lt;ref&gt;http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/01/28/city-councilwoman-blondell-reynolds-brown-fined-for-ethics-violations/&lt;/ref&gt; including her use of $4,500 of campaign funds for personal reasons. Brown's campaign manager was later accused of using $100,000 of political donations for personal uses and eventually found guilty of wire fraud.&lt;ref&gt;http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/02/07/councilwoman-reynolds-brown-says-ethics-scandal-wont-force-her-out/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Central Academy of Fine Arts''' or '''CAFA''' is an art academy managed by the [[Ministry of Education of China|Ministry of Education]] of China. The Manila Bulletin calls the school "China’s most prestigious and renowned art academy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://ap.itc.ntnu.edu.tw/istudent/oia/cooperation_sister_universities_introduction_content.jsp?sno1=2014081301&amp;sno2=2014081322&amp;country=CN&amp;schno=CN-004-CAFA]&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered one of the most selective schools in the country and turns away more than 90% of its applicants each year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/arts/design/30barb.html?pagewanted=all]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The history of '''National Art School in Beiping''' (国立北平艺术专科学校) dates back to the founding of '''National School of Fine Arts in Beijing''' in 1918, advocated by the educator [[Cai Yuanpei]]. It was the first national school of fine arts in China, and also the beginning of Chinese modern education of fine arts. The academy was founded in April 1950, as a result of merger between National Art School in Beiping and the department of fine arts at third campus of North China University. [[Mao Zedong]] wrote the school name. The former principals of CAFA include [[Xu Beihong]], [[Jiang Feng (artist)|Jiang Feng]], [[Wu Zuoren]], [[Gu Yuan (painter)|Gu Yuan]] and [[Jin Shangyi]]. Current president is the painter and historian of fine arts, Prof. [[Pan Gongkai]]. Current Vice President is renowned contemporary artist, [[Xu Bing]]. Current secretary of CPC's committee is Yang Li.  Current director of academic commission is the oil painter Jin Shangyi.

The academy comprises six specialty schools: School of Fine Art, School of Chinese Painting, School of Design, School of Architecture, School of Humanities, and School of Urban Design. A post-graduate education school and a high school of fine arts are also affiliated. There are 534 teachers and staffs for 3,800 undergraduate and graduate students, and over 100 international students at school. Its museum of fine arts boasts precious collections, including more than 2,000 Chinese scroll paintings since the [[Ming dynasty]]. CAFA edits, publishes and distributes two national first-class academic magazines, "Fine Arts Study" and "Fine Arts of the World". 

The design programme of CAFA was renewed in 1995 in the name of the Department of Art Design, after a break of some forty years, and became the School of Design in October, 2002. with the goal of preparing and training the students as future professionals in design with creative thinking and practical capabilities, the School of Design offers undergraduate, graduate and Ph.D. degrees in programs ranging from visual communication design, product design, fashion design, photography, digital media to design theory and history. The School of Design plays an important role in promoting design in China and is intensively involved in design activities, most noticeable of which are its designs for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

The new CAFA Art Museum, designed by Japanese architect [[Arata Isozaki]], is located at the northeast corner of CAFA campus at No.8, Huajiadi Nan Street, Wangjing, covering an area of 3546 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with total floor area of 14 777 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The Museum opened in October 2008, for the University's 90th anniversary. The new, six-floor museum has several notable collections, including over 2,000 historic Chinese scroll paintings dating to the Ming Dynasty. The museum hosts rotating exhibitions. Tickets are 10 RMB.

The school drew media attention during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], during which the students protested by creating a large statue, called the [[Goddess of Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tsao Tsing-yuan|title=Essay "The Birth of the Goddess of Democracy" from ''Popular Protest and Political Culture in Modern China''|editor=Jeffrey N. Wasserstrom and Elizabeth J. Perry|pages=140–7|location=Boulder, Col.|publisher=Westview Press|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the eight art academies signed [[Goddess of Democracy#Statement by its creators|a statement]] explaining the purpose of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cries For Democracy: Writings and Speeches from the 1989 Chinese Democracy Movement|author=Minzhu Han|year=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Oxford, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, asteroid [[118418 Yangmei]] was named in honor of the academy.

'''Change4Life''' is a [[public health]] programme in England which began in January 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/11/advertising-marketingandpr | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Mark | last=Sweney | title=Government unveils details of £275m Change4Life anti-obesity push | date=11 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; run by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]]. It is the country's first national [[social marketing]] campaign to tackle the causes of [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/supporter-resources/downloads/Change4Life_Marketing%20Strategy_April09.pdf|title=This will be England’s first ever national social marketing campaign to reduce obesity|date=April 2009|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Change4Life aims to help families and middle-aged adults make small, sustainable yet significant improvements to their diet, activity levels and alcohol consumption. It uses the slogan "eat well, move more, live longer".

Change4Life encourages people to adopt six healthy behaviours:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/changeforlife.aspx{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[5 A Day]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/five-a-day.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; – suggestions for ways to eat the recommended 5 portions of fruit and veg each day
*Watch the salt&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/avoid-salty-foods.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; – advice on reducing the amount of salt eaten each day, ideally keeping it to below 6g for adults
*Cut back fat&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/cut-back-on-fat.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; – information about the (mainly saturated) fat found in foods and ways to reduce this
*Sugar swaps&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/low-sugar-healthy-snacks.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; – information about sugar found in foods and suggestions for healthier alternatives
*Choose less [[alcohol (drug)|booze]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/drink-less-alcohol.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; – ways for adults cut down on alcohol consumption to within government lower-risk guidelines
*Get going every day&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/change4life/pages/get-going-every-day.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; – why it’s important to lead an active lifestyle and ways for adults and children to do this cheaply and easily

Change4Life also has six sub-brands that help intermediaries to promote a single issue with either a food or an activity focus (Bike4Life,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/bike4life-supporter-resources.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Breakfast4Life,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/breakfast4life-supporter-resources.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Let's Dance with Change4Life,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/lets-dance-supporter-resources.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Play4Life,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/play4life-supporter-resources.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Swim4Life&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/swim4life-supporter-resources.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and Walk4Life&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/walk4life-supporter-resources.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;). A range of resources is provided to enable them to disseminate these healthy living messages within their own context.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Change4Life/Pages/changeforlife.aspx{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing approach==
Change4Life adopts an integrated marketing approach and uses a variety of marketing channels including television and radio, digital, social media, PR and direct marketing. It uses animated television advertising by [[Aardman Animations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/02/wallace-gromit-obesity-ad-health | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sarah | last=Boseley | title=Matter of life and death: Wallace and Gromit makers get animated over UK obesity crisis | date=2 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a wider campaign. [[M&amp;C Saatchi]] lead on the creative aspects of the campaign with additional input from a range of other agencies providing PR, digital, planning and data services.

==Advertising==
On [[Channel 4]], Change4Life was a previous sponsor of [[The Simpsons]].

==Local supporters==
In addition to consumer marketing, Change4Life engages with intermediaries at a local level, including schools, NHS organisations, local authorities and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/change4life/pages/resource-casestudy.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; These local supporters are able to interact with the campaign audience in different ways and in different contexts to Change4Life’s central approach. Free resources including posters and leaflets are available to local supporters to enable them to do this effectively.

'''Colegio Nuestra Señora de Andacollo''' is a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] primary and secondary school administered by the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] since 1976 in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]]. It was founded by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Chile|Archdiocese of Santiago]] in 1904.  The school is dedicated to "[[Our Lady of Andacollo]]" ({{lang-es|Nuestra Señora de Andacollo}}), also known as the "Virgin of Andacollo" ({{lang-es|Virgen de Andacollo}}), a celebrated [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] image of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Virgin Mary]].

[[File:Primer día de clases 2011 Colegio Señora de Andacollo.jpg|300px|thumb|First day of classes, 2011.]]

== Founding ==
The history of Andacollo Parish School originates in the beginning of the 20th century in the midst many social questions.  In the midst of a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of then Santiago, full of tenements and house of ill-repute, was lifted the tower of a chapel that shared the same land as the Confraternity of Saint [[Vincent Ferrer]].  The Confraternity decided to destine the land for the construction of a sanctuary and a school for children that the priest of that era dedicated to Our Lady of Andacollo (Nuestra Señora de Andacollo).

In spite of always counting on the support of persons of good will, the economic highs and lows from the beginning of the school's history endangered the institution's future.  Hence, those around it have transformed a small school into something much larger.

The school opened in a simple for in 1904, teaching literacy to the young boys of the neighborhood.  Thus, the cornerstone was laid in 1906 of what would become the Sanctuary of Andacollo, under the direction of Rev. Ladislao Godoy, who would later be known as "el [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Cura]] de Andacollo" (the priest of Andacollo).

In the following year, some enthusiastic youth founded the first "Patronato de Andacollo."  As this building acquired increasing importance, the archbishop of Santiago erected it formally as a parish in June 1912., appointing Rev. Godoy as the first pastor.  In that same year, Miguel Covarrubias Valdés took the helm of the school, seeking those who wanted to help him with the work.

The plan for the Patronato was always clear from the start.  The idea was: "To take the child from the first years in school, provide a Christian education and a practical instruction, without disregard for the catechesis and sports on Sundays.  The young person will not be abandoned after graduation with the creation of an alumni organization and a worker's center.  The goal is to improve the neighborhood morally and materially and to promote hygiene and savings and to establish,as possible, organizations and unions."&lt;ref&gt;"Memoria del Patronato de Andacollo (1912-1918)," p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in rapid succession a variety of organizations were formed that accompanied not only the Christian formation of the child but also of the entire family.  To that end, in 1911, the "Protective Union of Andacollo" was formed as a mutual benefit society, the "St. Vincent DePaul Society was formed with organizations for both men and women in 1915, a Sunday school was launched in 1916, and a worker's center was formed in 1930.

The oldest attendance registry of the school dates covers the period from 1915 to 1919, with teacher Felix Berrios Bustamante, who was later named rector in 1919.

== Changes in the Colegio ==
The neighborhood around the parish and colegio was very porr.  In that period, streets were not paved and many houses of "ill repute" populated the neighborhood.  Hence, the patronato exercised a positive influence in the community, and the school was one of the best examples, since "the kids did not go about so dirty and all of them had shoes."&lt;ref&gt;"Memoria del Patronato de Andacollo (1912-1918), pp. 19-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school began to need analytic programs in conformity with the "modern" pedagogy of the day.  Thus, Aniceto Gallardo, director of the school "Escuela Olea," successfully implemented these reforms.

== Formation of a Saint ==
[[File:Stalberto.jpg|thumb|right|alt='''St. Alberto Hurtado"]]
In 1913, the parish school had 180 students.  That year, a night school was opened in addition to the day school, given that so many students worked during the day.  During this same period, a student from a prestigious Jesuit school, San Ignacio, volunteered at the parish and school.  That student worked in the office, as librarian, and as banker for the parish's students and its worker center.  This student later enrolled in law school, focus on labor law, before entering the seminary with the [[Jesuits]].  Today, he is known as St. [[Alberto Hurtado]].  St. Alberto Hurtado was a champion of youth and the poor.  His ministry with both began at Andacollo.&lt;ref&gt;Hurtado, S.J., Alberto, "Cartas E Informes del Padre Alberto Hurtado, S.J.," Santiago: Ediciones Universidad Catolica de Chile, 2005, pp. 13-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Corps Saxo-Thuringia München''' is a fraternity (''[[Studentenverbindung]]'') in [[Munich]], Germany, founded on March 15, 1882. It is one of 162 ''[[German Student Corps]]'' in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Latvia and Hungary today. The Corps is a member of the [[Weinheimer Senioren-Convent]] (WSC), the second oldest federation of classical European [[Corporation (university)|fraternal corporations]], with roots dating back to the 15th century and fraternities founded in several European countries.&lt;ref name="DieCorps"&gt;Die Corps. "Was sind die Corps? - Who are the Corps?" http://www.die-corps.de/interessenten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klimczuk"&gt;Klimczuk, Stephen &amp; [[Gerald Warner|Warner, Gerald]]. "[[Secret Places, Hidden Sanctuaries|Secret Places, Hidden Sanctuaries: Uncovering Mysterious Sites, Symbols, and Societies]]". Sterling Publishing, 2009, New York and London. {{ISBN|978-1-4027-6207-9}}. pp.&amp;nbsp;212–232 ("University Secret Societies and Dueling Corps").&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership in the fraternity is open to [[Honour|honorable]] men&lt;ref name="duel" /&gt; studying at one of Munich's [[University|universities]] and is based exclusively on personality, good moral standing, and strength of character.&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;Die Corps. "Prinzipien der Corps" An article explaining the principles of being a Corps Student: http://www.die-corps.de/prinzipien.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Corps Saxo-Thuringia value and engage in the tradition of academic fencing&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt; as a way to sharpen and prove their character under pressure. Continuing a practice dating back into the 1700s, Saxo-Thuringia's members wear the traditional [[couleur]], colored stripes, in lightblue-white-orange. The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members, stemming from diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Klimczuk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt;

== Fundamentals and principles ==
Like all ''German Student Corps'', Saxo-Thuringia expects tolerance from its members in [[German Student Corps#Politics|political]], [[German Student Corps#Sciences|scientific]] and [[List of members of German student corps|religious]] affairs.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt; Members are encouraged to have their own point of view about the world and be able to argue it, but Saxo-Thuringia as an entity always remains neutral. This ''[[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]]'' is a fundamental pillar of all Corps and differentiates them from fraternities who require a certain political or religious affinity.&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; The fraternity encourages freshly admitted (pledging "fox") members with diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds to prove themselves as valuable Corps brothers, purely on the basis of personal [[ethos|character]] and [[recognition (sociology)|merit]], before becoming eligible to be fully incorporated (''Rezeption'').&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt; The fraternity has about 200 members of all ages (including alumni) coming from or currently residing in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa. Every full member is a member for life.

[[File:Mühlberg - Säbelmensur.jpg|170px|thumb|left|[[Academic fencing|Academic "Mensur" fencing]] in 1900. Steel goggles provide added protection nowadays.]]
Members of the Corps Saxo-Thuringia value and practice the tradition of engagements in ''[[academic fencing]]'', or ''"Mensur"'' in German, with members of other old-school fraternities. Academic fencing, originating in the [[German school of fencing]], is understood as a way to exercise good judgement and prove character,&lt;ref name="duel" /&gt; allowing participants to show determination by standing their ground under pressure, while enhancing the bonds between the Corps brothers at the same time.&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fechten"&gt;Die Corps. "Hoch bitte – Los!" An article explaining the role of academic fencing at Corps: http://www.die-corps.de/fechten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] described one of these fencing duels/challenges in his day and age; his description is remarkably similar to current practices.&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2c" /&gt; Saxo-Thuringia's members identify themselves wearing the traditional ''couleur'', colored stripes, as well as caps and/or other specific garments at official occasions. This tradition, known as "wearing colors" (German: ''Farben tragen''), provides means to recognize members of other fraternities and, likewise, identification for the Corps brothers with each other and their traditions.&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;

''Activity'' and ''responsibility'' are two fundamental expectations for fraternity members. With the goal to achieve members who are prepared to become active leaders in society, every Corps brother is expected to hold a leadership position at least once for a term ("Semester") while a student. Members are further encouraged to organize internal and open fraternity events that draw attention from other fraternities and guests from industry, academia, politics and other active societies.&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; Allocating the necessary resources appropriately and living up to set expectations teaches responsibility.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt; All members must show active participation in the regular fraternity Convents, providing the foundation for the fraternity's members to meet and discuss past, present and future developments. Decisions are cast in a democratic manner, sometimes after intense debates. Participation at such Convents teaches a better understanding of proper argumentation, group dynamics and critical analysis of other members' views, plans and arguments, thereby preparing its participants to become active members of society.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt; Similarly, every member must finish his higher educational degree with good academic standing in order to advance to the status of ''Alter Herr'' (alumnus).

Long-term guidance is expected from and provided by said ''Alte Herren'', who often remain very engaged and well connected with the fraternity. Every year at the end of May, student and alumni members of all German Student Corps meet in one of two cities ([[Weinheim]] and [[Bad Kösen]]) for three days to refresh their bonds with their fraternity and friends from the entire Corps network (WSC/[[Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband|KSCV]]).&lt;ref name="DieCorps" /&gt; In addition to these international meetings once a year, alumni join the student members for multiple local meetings, lasting an evening or a weekend. These regular meetings result in strong bonds spanning the generations within the fraternity.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;

== History ==
{{Further information|German Student Corps|List of members of German student corps|Weinheimer Senioren-Convent}}

=== Landsmannschaft Nicaria from 1882 until 1910 ===
[[File:SchlägerOvBMuseumFriedrichsruh.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s student sword and helmet, comparable to those used by the fraternity's members then and now.]]
One half of the current fraternity was founded as [[Landsmannschaft]] Nicaria featuring the colors „Light blue - white - orange" and the [[Motto]] "Post Nubila Phoebus" (Sunshine follows rain) and the fencing motto "Amico pectus, hosti frontem" (Arm your friend, confront your enemgy) on March 15, 1882 near [[Stuttgart]].

=== Landsmannschaft Thuringia from 1898 until 1902 ===
The other half of the current fraternity was founded as [[Landsmannschaft]] Thuringia on November 2, 1898 with the colors "Black - Gold - Blue" in Munich. The motto was "Einigkeit macht stark“ (strength through unity) and fencing motto "Nunquam Retrorsum" (never retreat). After joining the umbrella organization Rudolstädter SC (RSC) in 1885, the fraternity chose to rename itself to Saxo-Thuringia in 1899. Later that year the fraternity grew by incorporating several members of the similar corporation Alemania. While a member of the RSC, the fraternity joined the ''[[Blaues Kartell]]'' in 1899/1900.

=== Fusion of Nicaria and Saxo-Thuringia in 1902 and transition to becoming a Corps ===
The fraternity members belonging to the RSC decided in 1902 to seize being a Landsmannschaft and transitioned the fraternity to a Corps ([[German Student Corps]]). Following the closure of the veterninary university in Stuttgart in 1910, Nicaria's members moved to Munich and fused with the Corps Saxo-Thuringia on October 29, 1910. Nicaria contributed a part of the new crest, the colors („Light blue - White - Orange"), the mottos and the official founding date of the new fraternity. Saxo-Thuringia contributed the name, the post-nominal ("[[Zirkel (Studentenverbindung)|Zirkel]]") and remaining parts of the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]].

== Relationships with other fraternities ==
Corps Saxo-Thuringia is a member of the "[[Blaues Kartell]]", a circle of four German Student Corps that understand the union as "one fraternity spanning four cities" (Berlin, Dresden, Hanover, and Munich).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;In chronological order. Links to the German Wikipedia are in process of being translated and currently indicated with ''"ge"''.&lt;/small&gt;
* Corps Hannoverania Hannover
* [[Corps Altsachsen Dresden]]
* [[Corps Berlin]]

The fraternity further has an official relationship with [[Corps Marko-Guestphalia Aachen]] since 2004 that has its origin in a fusion of Corps Albingia Aachen with the Corps Marko-Guestphalia in 1996. Corps Albingia had been reconstructed in Aachen after the second world war. Before the Nazis caused the [[German Student Corps]] to suspend activities in the 1930s, it flourished in Dresden where it had originally been founded on January 23, 1889. Corps Albingia Dresden was a former member of the Blaues Kartell.

'''''DinoPark Tycoon''''' is an [[educational game|educational]] [[business simulation game|business simulation]] [[computer game]] released by [[MECC]] in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] for [[MS-DOS]] and [[MacOS]]. Players run a [[theme park]] which features dinosaurs as its main attraction. The goal of the game is to care for the dinosaurs while keeping the park clean, organized, and well maintained.

== Background ==

''DinoPark Tycoon'' was developed by [[Manley &amp; Associates|Manley &amp; Associates Inc.]] and published by [[MECC]] (later [[SoftKey]]). Two versions were released: a retail version and a special school version, which was released to public elementary schools across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. In addition to the retail software, the school version includes background information and classroom activities for teachers.&lt;ref name="amag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue162/90_DinoPark_Tycoon.php |title=DinoPark Tycoon |publisher=Atarimagazines.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not required by the schools' curricula, but was intended to be a fun way for the students to learn basic finance and management skills.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Writer Larry Blasko of the [[Associated Press]] described the game as having realistic similarities to real-life business management, along with skills such as mathematical estimation and "what if?" analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kids can create their own 'Jurassic Park' |author=Blasko, Larry |date=1993-12-18 |page=6 |publisher=[[The Free Lance-Star]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z14zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mAcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3577%2C3837895 |accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==

The objective in ''DinoPark Tycoon'' is the successful administration of a dinosaur park. Players start off with a $5,000 loan in the retail version, or a $20,000 loan in the school version.&lt;ref name="amag" /&gt; The money is used to pay for the land, dinosaurs, fencing, food and employees necessary to run the park and pay back the loan; failure to meet loan payments results in the park's foreclosure.&lt;ref name="amag" /&gt; Once the loan is paid off, players may expand the park and earn profits. If players are confused, an animated dinosaur appears and guides the players through the game.&lt;ref name="amag" /&gt;

Players then visit supply stores to buy the necessary items for park maintenance. The food store provides meat for carnivores, plants for herbivores and seeds for planting. The general store provides fences for the dinosaur pens, with varying degrees of strength and price; concessions such as bathrooms, gift shops and parking lots; and advertising, which is bought per season. The employment office offers the personnel to run the park, and Dino City retails the dinosaurs for the exhibits.&lt;ref name="amag" /&gt;

As time passes, players face problems such as escaping dinosaurs, sick employees, and seasonal attendance declines. According to [[Atari]], "Keeping the staff paid and the dinos fed and healthy is an ongoing task that requires kids to analyze graphs and numbers and make decisions based on their assumptions. The trick is to scratch out enough profit to expand the park with capital improvements and bigger and better dinosaurs."&lt;ref name="amag" /&gt; After paying off the loan, players may choose to sell their park; if it has been successful, the player achieves an onscreen award and an entry on the top scores list.&lt;ref name="amag" /&gt;

== Ports ==

''DinoPark Tycoon'' was released for the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] home video game console in early 1994. It contains minor changes to gameplay and graphics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2572">A '''doctoral advisor''' (also '''dissertation director''' or '''dissertation advisor''') is a member of a [[university]] [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] whose role is to guide [[graduate student]]s who are candidates for a [[doctorate]], helping them select coursework, as well as shaping, refining and directing the students' choice of sub-[[academic discipline|discipline]] in which they will be examined or on which they will write a [[dissertation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The portable dissertation advisor|author=Miles Taft Bryant|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7619-4696-0|pages=9–11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Students generally choose advisors based on their areas of interest within their discipline, their desire to work closely with particular graduate faculty, and the willingness and availability of those faculty to work with them.

In some countries, the student's advisor serves as the chair of the doctoral examination or dissertation committees. In some cases, though, the person who serves those roles may be different from the faculty member who has most closely advised the student. For instance, in the [[Education in the Netherlands#Tertiary education|Dutch academic system]], only full professors (''hoogleraren'') may chair doctoral examinations, so students who have been advised by lower-ranked faculty members will have a full professor as their official advisor (or ''promotor'') and their actual advisor as ''co-promotor''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/blufguide/node42.html A Few Words about Dutch University Titles, Ranks etc.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616192631/http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/blufguide/node42.html |date=2011-06-16 }}, Astronomy Department, [[Leiden University]]. Retrieved 2010-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, such as Spain, the doctoral advisor has the role of a mentor, but is not allowed to form part of the examination committee. This is a body of 5 experts independently selected by the rectorate among 10 candidates proposed by the university's department.

An [[academic genealogy]] may be traced based on student's doctoral advisors, going up and down the lines of academic "descent" in a manner analogous to a traditional [[genealogy]].

More than 70 schools, nonprofit organizations, and corporations offer or plan to offer courses on the edX website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edx.org/schools-partners|title=Schools and Partners|work=edX}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 29 December 2017, edX has around 14 million students taking more than 1,800 courses online.&lt;ref name="edxYear2017InReview"&gt;{{cite web |title=EdX’s 2017: Year in Review |url=https://www.class-central.com/report/edx-2017-review/ |work=edX |date=4 January 2018 |access-date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==

EdX courses consist of weekly learning sequences. Each learning sequence is composed of short videos interspersed with interactive learning exercises, where students can immediately practice the concepts from the videos. The courses often include tutorial videos that are similar to small on-campus discussion groups, an online textbook, and an online discussion forum where students can post and review questions and comments to each other and teaching assistants. Where applicable, online laboratories are incorporated into the course. For example, in edX's first MOOC — a circuits and electronics course — students built virtual circuits in an online lab.&lt;ref&gt;Studying Learning in the Worldwide Classroom: Research Into edX's First MOOC, RPA Journal, June 14, 2013, By Lori Breslow, David E. Pritchard, Jennifer DeBoer, Glenda S. Stump, Andrew D. Ho, and Daniel T. Seaton.&lt;/ref&gt;

EdX offers certificates of successful completion and some courses are credit-eligible. Whether or not a college or university offers credit for an online course is within the sole discretion of the school.&lt;ref name="edXFAQ" /&gt;  EdX offers a variety of ways to take courses, including verified courses where students have the option to audit the course (no cost) or to work toward an edX Verified Certificate (fees vary by course). For courses announced before December 7, 2015, there was an option to take honor code courses to work toward an Honor Code Certificate (no cost).&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.edx.org/news-about-edx-certificates?track=blog&lt;/ref&gt; EdX also offers XSeries Certificates for completion of a bundled set of two to seven verified courses in a single subject (cost varies depending on the courses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edx.org/verified-certificate|title=Verified Certificate|work=edX}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edx.org/xseries|title=XSeries|work=edX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

In addition to educational offerings, edX is utilized for research into learning and distance education by collecting learners' clicks and analyzing the data, as well as collecting demographics from each registrant.&lt;ref name="edXFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=edX FAQs|url=https://www.edx.org/faq|publisher=edX|accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laura Pappano (Nov. 2, 2012), "The Year of the MOOC," ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHEAnnounce"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harvard and MIT Put $60-Million Into New Platform for Free Online Courses|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/harvard-and-mit-put-60-million-into-new-platform-for-free-online-courses/36284|accessdate=May 3, 2012|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=May 2, 2012|author=Nick DeSantis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTAnnounce"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harvard and M.I.T.

Pritchard, Jennifer DeBoer, Glenda S. Stump, Andrew D. Ho, and Daniel T. Seaton.&lt;/ref&gt;  EdX member schools and organizations also conduct their own research using data collected from their courses.&lt;ref name="edx.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edx.org|title=edX|work=edX}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research focuses on improving retention, course completion and learning outcomes in traditional campus courses and online.&lt;ref&gt;Faculty of Arts and Sciences/Harvard College Fun (Sept/Oct 2013), "On the Leading Edge of Teaching."&lt;/ref&gt;

EdX has engaged in a number of partnerships with educational institutions in the United States, China, Mongolia, Japan, and more to utilize edX courses in "blended classrooms."&lt;ref name="edx.org"/&gt; In blended learning models, traditional classes include an online interactive component. San Jose State University (SJSU) partnered with edX to offer 6.00xL ''Introduction to Computer Science and Programming'', as a blended course at SJSU and released an initial report on the project in February 2013. Initial results showed a decrease in failure rates from previous semesters. The percentage of students required to retake the course dropped from 41% under the traditional format to 9% for those taking the edX blended course.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Junn and Cathy Cheal of San Jose State University report on the universities' efforts to incorporate MIT's Electronics and Circuits course 6.002x ''Little Hoover Commission Public Hearing Testimony''&lt;/ref&gt;  In Spring 2013, Bunker Hill Community College and Massachusetts Bay Community College implemented a SPOC, or small private online course. The colleges incorporated an MIT-developed Python programming course on EdX into their campus-based courses, and reported positive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinelearningconsortium.org/conference/2013/blended/moocs-community-college-implications-innovation-classroom|title=MOOCs in the Community College: Implications for Innovation in the Classroom - Online Learning Consortium, Inc|work=onlinelearningconsortium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/09/spocs_small_private_online_classes_may_be_better_than_moocs.html|title=SPOCs: Small private online classes may be better than MOOCs.|work=Slate Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open edX==
Open edX is the [[open-source software|open-source]] platform software developed by EdX and made freely available to other institutions of higher learning that want to make similar offerings. On June 1, 2013, edX open sourced its entire platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/april/edx-collaborate-platform-030313.html|title=Stanford to collaborate with edX to develop a free, open source online learning platform|work=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source code can be found on [[GitHub]].&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/edx/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OpenEdX"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/edx/edx-platform|title=EdX-platform|work=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Open edX server-side software is almost entirely based on "[[Python (programming language)|Python]], with [[Django (web framework)|Django]] as the [[web application framework]]."&lt;ref name="SoftW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Open edX Architecture|url=https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-developer-guide/en/latest/architecture.html|publisher=edX Inc.|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
Several higher-education institutions use the Open edX to provide [[MOOC]] services, such as [[St. George's University]] Online,&lt;ref name="stgeorge"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://online.sgu.edu/about |title=About Online SGU |website=online.sgu.edu |language=en |access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MIT]]'s MITx platform,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://odl.mit.edu/campus/residential-mitx |title=Residential MITx  Office of Digital Learning |website=odl.mit.edu |language=en |access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of La Serena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://campus.userena.digital/terminosservicio |title=Terminos del servicio  Campus Digital |website=campus.userena.digital |language=es |access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some private companies also use Open edX to provide training to target populations. For example, [[MongoDB]] uses the "Mongo University", powered by Open edX, to provide training for their database product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://university.mongodb.com/about/how-mongodb-university-online-courses-are-produced |title=How MongoDB University Online Courses are Produced |website=university.mongodb.com |access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
In March 2014, edX appointed Wendy Cebula, former COO of [[Vistaprint]], as its President and Chief Operating Officer. CEO [[Anant Agarwal]] of MIT stated that Cebula would bring "an entrepreneurial aspect" and help the nonprofit to access "commercial opportunities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/3/25/edx-new-COO-president/ |title=With Eye Toward Financial Self-Sufficiency, edX Hires Businesswoman Cebula as President and COO |publisher=Harvard Crimson|date=2014-03-25 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alan M. Garber, Provost of Harvard University, assisted by [[Michael D. Smith (computer scientist)|Michael D. Smith]], a computer scientist who is Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, handles Harvard contributions. The design of a viable business model for sustainability of the enterprise is in progress.&lt;ref name=CHEAnnounce /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7066">'''Estonian Maritime Academy''' of TUT (Estonian: TTÜ Eesti Mereakadeemia) is a [[vocational university]] in [[Estonia]]. It is one of the schools of [[Tallinn University of Technology]] and it is the only educational institution in Estonia that offers professional higher education and Master’s level education in the maritime field. The university is located in the capital [[Tallinn]] but also has two centres in [[Saaremaa]]. In addition to higher education, the school contributes to research, provides training and offers services. The Academy also holds a one of a kind Simulator Centre and has a whole dedicated floor of hi-tech laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;https://ttu.ee/asutused/mereakadeemia/emera/ajalugu-43/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History&lt;ref&gt;https://ttu.ee/asutused/mereakadeemia/emera/ajalugu-43/&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The first marine school in Estonia was founded in 1715 in Tallinn, later the school was founded in [[Narva]] as well. In these so-called calculation-schools, the sailors and shipbuilders studied different subjects, including navigation.

'''In 1880,''' a school was founded in Tallinn for children of the port factory and workshop staff. The better graduates of the school received the right to work as deck officers on ships. In the second half of the 19th century, a number of Estonian maritime schools were founded. The first of these was the Heinaste Maritime School (1864-1916), where the teaching languages were Estonian, Russian and Latvian. Other maritime schools followed in other cities as well: in Narva (1873 – 1918), [[Paldiski]] (1876 – 1916), [[Käsmu]] (1884 – 1931), [[Kuressaare]] (1891 – 1915), (1919 – 1928), (1942 – 1944), and [[Pärnu]] (1919 – 1922), (1945 – 1989).

The Tallinn Maritime School, the predecessor of the Estonian Maritime Academy of TUT, '''was founded in 1919.''' At the same time, a class of engineer officers was opened at the Tallinn University of Applied Sciences (Estonian: Tallinna Tehnikum), which in 1920 became the Tallinn Ship Engineer School and, in 1935, was merged with the Tallinn Maritime School.

'''In 1945,''' the Tallinn Marine Fisheries Technicum was established, which was renamed the Tallinn Fisheries Technical School in 1956, the Tallinn Fish Industry Marine School in 1965, and the Tallinn Marine College in 1989.

During the period of [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation]] '''from 1945 to 1991''', the Estonian Maritime Schools belonged to the unified maritime education system of the [[USSR]], and therefore the maritime education of Estonia was predominantly in Russian. In the newly independent Estonia, Estonian is again the language of instruction.

'''At the beginning of the 1990s,''' three educational institutions in the maritime education field were provided in Tallinn:

* Tallinn Maritime School (Estonian: Tallinna Merekool)
* Tallinn Marine College (Estonian: Tallinna Merekolledž)
* Tallinn 1st Industrial School (Estonian: Tallinna 1. Kutsekeskkool)

'''In 1992,''' a united Estonian Maritime Education Center was formed, which merged Tallinn's Marine College and Tallinn 1st Industrial School. Before that, in 1991, the Pärnu Maritime School and the Oceanic Sea Marine School of Production were liquidated.

'''In 1999''' Estonian Marine Education Center was renamed to the Estonian Maritime Academy.

'''In the autumn of 2006,''' a master's degree in maritime academy was opened.&lt;ref&gt;http://epl.delfi.ee/news/eesti/mereakadeemia-kolib-ajaloolisse-laevaremonditehase-hoonesse?id=51041473&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In 2009,''' the Marine Academy's management moved from [[Lasnamäe]] to the top of the [[Kopli]] peninsula at the Kopli 101 building. Different faculties followed: The Maritime Faculty and the Training Center from Luise street building and in 2012, the Faculty of Shipping, the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and other support structures from the Mustakivi street building.
'''On August 1, 2014,''' the Estonian Maritime Academy joined the Technical University of Tallinn and became one of the colleges and since then has been renamed Estonian Maritime Academy of TUT. When joining TUT, the Estonian Maritime Academy was separated from the Industrial Education Department, which became an independent educational institution called the Estonian Maritime School, located in the Kopli 101 courtyard building. The Joining Agreement was signed on April 23 of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.err.ee/511792/mereakadeemia-ja-ttu-uhinemise-tulemusena-sunnib-lisaks-ka-kutsekool&lt;/ref&gt;

'''On January 1, 2017''', the Estonian Maritime Academy of TUT became one out of the five faculties of the TUT. When joining, the former TUT Kuressaare College was named the Kuressaare Center of the Estonian Maritime Academy of TUT. TTU Small Craft Competence Center (SCC) continued with its former name.&lt;ref&gt;https://ttu.ee/asutused/mereakadeemia/emera/ajalugu-43/kronoloogia/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Kuressaare Center&lt;ref&gt;https://ttu.ee/asutused/mereakadeemia/emera/ajalugu-43/kuressaare-ajalugu/&lt;/ref&gt; ==
[...] 
In '''2014''', the Small Craft Competence Center was opened, the college celebrated its 15th birthday at the new address Tallinn 19, the electronic systems and the small craft engineering curricula were merged into the Marine Engineering programme. 
In '''2017''', TUT Kuressaare College was joined to the Maritime Academy. When joining, the former TUT Kuressaare College was named the Kuressaare Center of the Estonian Maritime Academy of TUT. TTU Small Craft Competence Center (SCC) continued with its former name

'''Ewing Marion Kauffman''' (September 21, 1916{{spaced ndash}} August 1, 1993) was an American [[pharmaceutical]] entrepreneur, [[philanthropist]], and [[Major League Baseball]] owner.

==Early life and education==
Born on a farm near [[Garden City, Missouri]], the son of John S. Kauffman and the former Effie May Winders,&lt;ref name="nyt obit"/&gt; Kauffman grew up with his sister Irma Ruth Kauffman in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], Missouri.  He was bedridden for a year at age 11 with a heart ailment, during which he read as many as 40 books a month.

Kauffman graduated from Kansas City's [[Westport High School (Missouri)|Westport High School]] in 1934, and later attended [[Metropolitan Community College (Missouri)|Kansas City Junior College]],&lt;ref name="nyt obit"/&gt;

He was an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] and as an adult would be awarded the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]].&lt;ref name="desalistg"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/02-529.pdf | title = Distinguished Eagle Scouts | format = [[PDF]] format |publisher = Scouting.org|accessdate = November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After completing his Associate Degree, Kauffman enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] serving as a Sailor on a ship during World War II. After leaving the Navy, he worked as a pharmaceutical salesman until 1950, when he formed [[Marion Laboratories]] with a $5,000 investment, operating it initially out of the basement of his home.  He reportedly chose to use his middle name rather than his last name in order to not appear to be a one-man operation.

Marion Laboratories{{spaced ndash}} with Kauffman as chairman{{spaced ndash}} had revenues of $930 million the year before it merged, in 1989, with Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals to form [[Marion Merrell Dow]].&lt;ref name="nyt obit"/&gt; The company sale made more than 300 millionaires.  Following the merger, Kauffman became chairman emeritus of the merged company.&lt;ref name="nyt obit"/&gt;

===Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation===
Kauffman established the [[Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kauffman.org Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-1960s with the same sense of opportunity he brought to his business endeavors, and, with the same convictions. Kauffman wanted his foundation to be innovative{{spaced ndash}} to fundamentally change people's lives. He wanted to help young people, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, get a quality education that would enable them to reach their full potential. He saw building enterprise as one of the most effective ways to realize individual promise and spur the economy. Today, the mission of the Kauffman Foundation follows his vision by focusing its grant making and operations on two areas: advancing entrepreneurship and improving the education of children and youth.&lt;ref&gt;The Philanthropy Roundtable, [http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/almanac/hall_of_fame/ewing_kauffman Ewing Kauffman]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kansas City Royals===
[[File:Ewing Kauffman and Cedric Tallis.jpg|thumb|260px|Kauffman with Royals [[general manager]] [[Cedric Tallis]], 1968]]
Ewing Kauffman established the [[Kansas City Royals]], bringing major league baseball back to Kansas City. Shortly before Kauffman's death, he set up an unprecedented complex succession plan to keep the team in Kansas City.

On November 8, 2007, he was nominated to enter the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] as part of the 2008 class;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=November 8, 2007 |url=http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071108&amp;content_id=5386&amp;vkey=hof_pr |title=Executives, Managers, and Umpires to Be Considered for 2008 |publisher=[[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] |accessdate=October 2, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115150027/http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071108&amp;content_id=5386&amp;vkey=hof_pr |archivedate=November 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was not elected.  He was later nominated and elected to the [[Kansas Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/high-school/other-kansas-prep-sports/article213119239.html|publisher=[[Kansas City Star]]|accessdate=June 14, 2018|date=June 13, 2018|title=Royals' Kauffman, Paul Pierce, Larry Drew among Kansas Sports Hall of Fame inductees|first=Hayden|last=Barber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project Choice===
In 1988, Kauffman made a commitment to a group of high school students that if they would stay in school, stay off drugs, avoid [[Teenage pregnancy|teenage parenthood]], commit to being good citizens and graduate on time, he would fund their post-secondary education. To be eligible for the program, parents also had to agree to be involved in their child's education by attending meetings and participating in parent/teacher organizations and other activities. Project Choice was offered to students at Kauffman's alma mater, Westport High School, and to selected students at five high schools in Kansas City, Missouri and [[Kansas City, Kansas]].{{clarify|date=October 2013|reason=does project choice still exist?}}

===Kauffman Stadium===
At a time when other cities were building cookie-cutter, multipurpose sports facilities Kauffman went against the trend to build a home for the team, [[Royals Stadium]], that was decades ahead of its time. The stadium was the only baseball-only facility built in the major leagues between 1966 and 1991. Fans in one of the sport's smallest markets responded by filling the stadium, topping the two-million attendance mark a total of ten times and seven seasons in a row.

The stadium opened on April 10, 1973, as part of the [[Truman Sports Complex]] in Kansas City.

Designed by Kivett and Meyers architects in Kansas City, the stadium incorporated the best of the recently-built [[Dodger Stadium]] and [[Anaheim Stadium]], with 40,793 seats, all facing second base and arranged in three tiers.

A construction strike delayed the opening of the stadium so Kauffman added money to make sure it would open in time for the [[1973 in baseball|1973 baseball season]] and the [[1973 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].

The stadium's prominent features include water fountains beyond the outfield fence and a ten-story-high scoreboard shaped like the Royals crest, topped by a gold crown. The {{convert|322|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide|abbr=off}} [[water spectacular]] is the largest privately funded fountain in the world. The stadium featured an artificial-turf field, which was replaced in 1995 with grass.

Kauffman made his last public appearance at the stadium on May 23, 1993, when he was inducted into the [[Kansas City Royals Hall of Fame]]. One month before Kauffman died, the facility was officially renamed in his honor in a ceremony at the stadium on July 2, 1993; it is the only stadium in the [[American League]] named in honor of a person.

==Personal life==
In 1962, he married the former Muriel Irene McBrien.&lt;ref name="nyt obit"/&gt; He had two children from a previous marriage.

===Death===
Suffering from [[bone cancer]], he died, age 76,  at his home in [[Mission Hills, Kansas]], a suburb of Kansas City.&lt;ref name="nyt obit"&gt;Pace, Eric (August 12, 1993).  [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/02/obituaries/ewing-m-kauffman-76-owner-of-kansas-city-baseball-team.html "Ewing M. Kauffman, 76, Owner of Kansas City Baseball Team"].  ''[[The New York Times]]''.

He is Professor and Vice-Chair of [[Obstetrics]], [[Gynecology]] and Reproductive Sciences and Professor of [[Cell Biology]] and [[Physiology]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he is also Director of the Division of Developmental and Regenerative Medicine at the university's [[University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. Additionally, he is Deputy Director of the [http://institute.mwrif.org/ Magee-Womens &lt;!-- do not change "Womens" to "Women's". It IS called 'Magee-Womens Research Institute' --&gt;Research Institute] and Director of the [http://www.pdc.magee.edu/ Pittsburgh Development Center].&lt;ref name="pdc"&gt;[http://www.pdc.magee.edu/faculty/schatten.html Gerald P. Schatten, PhD],  [http://www.pdc.magee.edu/ Pittsburgh Development Center].{{Self-published inline|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Schatten was born in 1949 in [[New York City]] and was educated in the public school system, including at [[Stuyvesant High School]]. He graduated with an A.B. in Zoology from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1971, where he also obtained his Ph.D. in [[cell biology|Cell]] and [[Developmental Biology]].&lt;ref name="pdc" /&gt;

== Academic career ==
Schatten was awarded a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] Postdoctoral Fellowship for 1976-1977 to conduct mentored research under the direction of [[Daniel Mazia]] at UC Berkeley.&lt;ref name="pdc" /&gt; He was also awarded a postdoctoral fellowship at the [[German Cancer Research Center]].&lt;ref name="pdc" /&gt;

He successively occupied the following positions:

*1976-1985: Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Full Professor of [[Biological Sciences]] and [[Molecular Biophysics]] at [[Florida State University]]; while there, he received a [[National Institutes of Health]] Research Career Development Award.
*1985–1997: Professor of [[Zoology]], [[Molecular Biology]], [[Animal Science]] and [[Obstetrics]]-[[Gynecology]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. Here he was also director of the Integrated Microscopy Resource and Senior Scientist at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center and at the Waisman Center for Human Development.
*1997–2001: Professor and Vice-Chair of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]] and Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology. He was also Research Director of OHSU’s enter for Women’s Health, as well as Director of Assisted Reproductive Technologies and Scientist at the Oregon National Primate Research Center.
*2001 – present: Professor and Vice-Chair of  Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences and Professor of Cell Biology and [[Physiology]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he is also Director of the Division of Developmental and Regenerative Medicine at the School of Medicine. Additionally, he is Deputy Director of the Magee-Women's Research Institute &lt;!-- do not change "Womens" to "Women's". It IS called 'Magee-Womens Research Institute' --&gt;and Director of the Pittsburgh Development Center.&lt;ref name="pdc" /&gt;

Throughout his academic career, Schatten has also conducted research and taught at various other institutions. During 1985-1986, he was an Instructor in Molecular Embryology of the Mouse at the [[Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory]] and a Resident Instructor of Embryology at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]. From 1986-1987, he held a visiting professorship at the [[List of Stanford University Centers and Institutes|Hopkins Marine Station]] of [[Stanford University]].

== Research ==
Schatten's research focuses on [[molecular imaging|imaging]], cell biology, [[motility|cell motility]], cell architecture, human and other primates [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART), reproductive and [[senescence|cell aging]], [[cloning]], [[transgenesis]], and [[stem cell]]s.&lt;ref name="pdc" /&gt; His research has been funded through the National Institutes of Health&lt;ref name="pdc" /&gt; as well as the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and the [[NASA]].

Schatten’s work has been published extensively in many journals, such as ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'', ''[[Nature Medicine]]'', ''Nature Cell Biology'', ''Journal of Cell Biology'', ''Genetics'', ''Development'', ''Developmental Biology'', ''Biology of Reproduction'', ''Human Reproduction'', and the ''Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics''.&lt;ref name="pubmed"&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=search&amp;db=pubmed&amp;term=schatten%20g Schatten, G.] in [[PubMed]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fertilization and reproduction ===
Schatten’s work on fertilization examines the differential inheritance of cellular components contributed by the sperm and egg, respectively, as well as the program of [[oocyte]] activation and [[cell division]] during [[meiosis]] and [[mitosis]].  His group has demonstrated the importance of the sperm [[centrosome]]-[[centriole]] complex during mammalian fertilization (including humans), with the unexpected exception of rodents in which the centrosome is of maternal origin (see Selected Publications).

=== Imaging and microscopy ===
Schatten also made contributions to imaging and [[microscopy]]. In his first published paper, he demonstrated the utility of [[polylysine]] and other engineered [[peptide]]s that could adhere to cells, [[embryo]]s, and intracellular structures for various microscopic applications and purifications (see Selected Publications). This technology is now widely applied and has solved the problem of holding cells for imaging. His team also published findings on imaging [[calcium]] and other ion transients in egg, embryos and cells, as well as dynamic architectural alternations during fertilization and cell division (see Selected Publications).

=== Transgenesis and stem cells ===
His more recent research has focused on the use of human and [[primate]] stem cells to determine the potential of stem cell-based medical therapies and better understand cell and human development; the study of [[genetics|genetic]] versus [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] (environmental) causes for human disease; cloned transgenic disease modeling (using primates) (see Selected Publications).&lt;ref name="pdc" /&gt;

=== Bioethical considerations ===
Schatten has also published on the topic of scientific ethics, including a 1998 piece on bio-ethical aspects of ART, "Art before Science?", in the ''Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics'' as well as a 2002 article in ''Nature Cell Biology'' titled "Safeguarding ART". Soon after, Schatten helped expose cloning frauds both by the [[Raëlism|Raelians]] and by a Korean lab he had links to. More recently, in 2009, he commented on the utilities and limitations of human disease modeling in genetically modified monkeys in the journal ''Nature''. In 2005, Schatten came to widespread media attention when he broke off his 20-month collaboration with [[Hwang Woo-suk]], a [[Koreans|Korean]] stem cell researcher, after reporting, first ethical, and later scientific lapses.&lt;ref name="tche"&gt;Guterman, Lila. [http://chronicle.com/weekly/v52/i22/22a01501.htm “Silent Scientist Under Fire: the American Collaborator of a Disgraced South Korean Is Keeping Mum”], ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 and 2005, Hwang claimed that his lab at the [[Seoul National University]] had successfully extracted stem cells from cloned human embryos, a statement later proved false.&lt;ref name="tche" /&gt; ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' retracted both the 2004 article, in which Schatten had no involvement, and the 2005 article, which he participated in as a co-author.&lt;ref name="tche" /&gt; Schatten himself called for an investigation by his university, the University of Pittsburgh, in 2005.&lt;ref name="tche" /&gt; Finished in February 2006, the investigation committee concluded that Schatten was not guilty of [[scientific misconduct]], because he was not involved in the falsification of data.&lt;ref name="tche" /&gt;

== Research mentoring ==
Schatten has trained twenty doctoral and thirty postdoctoral fellows and he serves on the executive board of [[UNESCO]]’s International Cell Research Organization, a body devoted exclusively to research career training and mentorship.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/ngo/icro/executive.shtml Executive Committee], [[UNESCO]] International Cell Research Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; With Roger Pedersen (Cambridge, UK), Schatten established "Frontiers in Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research", an NIH-sponsored advanced training course for new and established investigators.&lt;ref name="pdc" /&gt; As with his [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]]-sponsored "Frontiers in Reproduction" course at the Woods Hole laboratory, this endeavor brings physician-scientists together with non-clinical counterparts for full-time, side-by-side, hands-on research training.&lt;ref name="pdc" /&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Schatten’s honors include: NIH Sadler Lectureship (1997); NIH MERIT award (1997);&lt;ref name="pdc" /&gt; the Purkinje Medal (2003) awarded by the Czech Academy of Sciences;&lt;ref name="pdc" /&gt; Daniel Mazia Award from Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station (2003); Elected Fellow (1997) and Delegate (2005) of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]; Patrick Steptoe Medal of the British Fertility Society (2005); the Stem Cell and Policy Award from the Genetics Policy Institute (2005); Pioneer in Embryonic Stem Cell Research (2006) awarded by FrhESC at Stanford University and Council Member of the [[National Institute of Aging]] (2006). Schatten has also lectured widely and testified for the [[United States Senate]],&lt;ref name="olpa"&gt;[http://olpa.od.nih.gov/hearings/107/session2/reports/stemcell.asp "September 25, 2002 Hearings. 107th Congress Hearings"], [[Office of Legislative Policy]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaas"&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/spp/cstc/briefs/stemcells/stemhearings.shtml "Congressional Hearings Held on Stem Cell Research"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810173316/http://www.aaas.org/spp/cstc/briefs/stemcells/stemhearings.shtml |date=2009-08-10 }}, [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[The President's Council on Bioethics]],&lt;ref name="pcbe"&gt;[http://www.bioethics.gov/transcripts/dec02/session6.html "Assisted Reproductive Technologies in the Genomics Era"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520053616/http://www.bioethics.gov/transcripts/dec02/session6.html |date=2009-05-20 }} [[The President's Council on Bioethics]].

'''High school clubs and organizations''', are student based school organizations, consisting of administration-approved organizations functioning with myriad tasks, varying on the specific purpose of each respective club. Clubs composed of students, with adults as advising figures to maintain the functionality of clubs. Clubs primarily focus on four aspects: [[fundraising]], [[community service]], [[Career|career interest]], and interpersonal dynamics (also known as [[group dynamics]]). In general, clubs are broken down into two main categories: State and/or Nationwide organizations, and local clubs. Within major, nationwide club organizations, each individual charter within each school is referred to as a "chapter". Clubs are started by either corporations, counterpart adult organizations, or campus students looking to satisfy a need or demand. 

==History of clubs==
The first high school student-based organization chartered in [[Sacramento High School]] in California, in May 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Arnold | first1 = Oren | title = The Widening Path | publisher = Kiwanis International | year = 1949 | pages = 70 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=trWQAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=The+widening+path | accessdate = 2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of instilling an organized, separate entity separate from the school itself came from Albert Olney, and Frank Vincent. They were school administrators and [[Kiwanis Club]] members who were looking to form a junior service club in the school. This organization later became known as [[Key Club]]. Key Club now stands today as the largest student-based organization in the world, though not the largest high school organization in the world.

Tracking down precise history of high school organizations is difficult as several thousand types of clubs exist. Prominent clubs include high school subdivisions of [[Red Cross]], [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]], [http://www.unicefusa.org/highschoolclubs UNICEF Clubs], [[National Honor Society]], [[National Beta Club]], [[Junior State of America]], [[Rotary International#Interact|Interact]], [[FBLA-PBL|Future Business Leaders of America-Phi Beta Lambda]],  among many other organizations. Each club has their own timeline, with hallmark internal achievements only known by members of each respective club. As well as single-school clubs, such as a Debate Club, Geocaching Club, and others of the like.

==Types of clubs==
There are four main club categories: fundraising, community service, career interest, and interpersonal dynamics. Many clubs offer a combination of each element.

===Fundraising===
Many people polarize toward fundraising for a major organization or movement. Fundraising appeals to people as high school students make a direct impact on [[international relations|international affairs]], such as funding [[cancer research]] or [[environmental preservation]].

===Community service===
Many schools require that students perform a certain community service quota. To obtain such a threshold, many people turn to community service organizations such as [http://www.nationalexchangeclub.org Exchange Clubs], [[Key Club]], [[Interact Club]], [[Lion's Club]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], [[FCCLA]],and local clubs. In doing so, many teenagers experience more camaraderie while performing community service. Other individuals just enjoy helping the local community around them.

===Career interest===
Many teenagers join clubs that revolve around their career interest. Many clubs, such as [[High Schools Society]] &lt;ref&gt;highschoolssociety.com&lt;/ref&gt; in Ghana, Junior State of America&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsa.org/ Junior State of America]&lt;/ref&gt; and Future Scientist and Engineers of America focus on specific career fields and help students understand them better. Many competitions, awards, and conventions are held to give club members advantages in these fields by exposing them to new opportunities. In addition, members of career interest clubs network with other students who will enter similar fields.

===Interpersonal dynamics===
Many teenagers join clubs that offer no academic, organizational, or community benefit. These clubs tend to focus around culture, social dynamics, and self-interest. These clubs look to satisfy the needs and demands of teenagers in each school, based on environment, tradition, and culture. Clubs such as an Anime Club can bring students to socialize.

The '''Institute for Responsible Citizenship''' is an intensive leadership development program for talented African-American men. Its mission is to prepare men to be exemplary citizens and leaders. 

==Core Beliefs==
The Institute was founded on five core beliefs:
* Men with the greatest potential should be challenged to pursue the highest achievement.
* Men who work hard to achieve academic success should be recognized and rewarded.
* Men who are destined for leadership should understand fundamental economic and constitutional principles.
* Men who strive to make a difference can have a greater impact by working together.
* Men of character should be encouraged to pursue success as a platform for service to their communities, our nation, and the world.

==History==
The Institute for Responsible Citizenship was founded in 2003 by William A. Keyes, IV.&lt;ref name="OSU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oma.osu.edu/current-students/bell-resource-center/programs/the-mac-a-stewart-distinguished-award-for-service.php |accessdate=September 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716201750/http://oma.osu.edu/current-students/bell-resource-center/programs/the-mac-a-stewart-distinguished-award-for-service.php |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recipient of the 2010 Mac A. Stewart Distinguished Award for Service presented by [[The Ohio State University]], Keyes has previously worked in the legislative and executive branches of the [[U.S. Federal Government]] and public affairs consulting.&lt;ref name="OSU"/&gt;

==Programs==
From hundreds of applications, the Institute selects some of the nation's best and brightest African American male college students to participate in an intensive two-summer program. It includes:
* High-level internships in their fields of interest
* The Lynde and Harry Bradley Seminar on Economic and Constitutional Principles
* Comprehensive leadership seminar with the Institute's founder
* Private briefings with some of the nation's most prominent public and private sector leaders
* Service as teachers and mentors in the Institute's Youth Scholar Academy.
The Institute supplements these activities with extensive support from the Institute's alumni, staff, and friends.  Most importantly, scholars become a part of a genuine network that will support them throughout their lives.

Each summer, the Institute also welcomes several groups of high school boys to Washington, DC to participate in the Youth Scholar Academy. YSA is a summer enrichment and college prep program that prepares high-potential young men to thrive in high school, college, and life.  Each group participates in a week-long session led by Institute scholars. The boys:
* Take classes in subjects such as a U.S. Government and Economics
* Participate in specialized sessions focused on personal growth and development
* Visit area colleges and learn about the admissions process
* Live in a residence hall at American University and eat in a campus dining hall
* Visit national landmarks and institutions
* Benefit from meaningful engagement with the Institute's scholars and alumni who provide positive images of academic success and exposure to life's possibilities.

==Alumni==
Since 2003, the Institute has grown to serve more than 150 scholars and alumni across the country. They have a wide variety of interests and represent small liberal arts colleges, large universities, Ivy League institutions, and historically Black college and universities.  Alumni have been accepted to all of the nation's top law schools and many of the nation's leading graduate programs.

Alumni of the program include a [[Rhodes Scholar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.americanrhodes.org/assets/attachments/TARS_2009_web.pdf |title=The American Rhodes Scholar: Volume XV, Number 1 |publisher=Association of American Rhodes Scholars |work=[http://www.americanrhodes.org americanrhodes.org] |date=April 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; numerous [[Truman Scholars]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smu.edu/News/2009/warren-seay-27march2009.aspx |title=Political Science Student Receives Prestigious Truman Scholarship |work=[[Southern Methodist University]] |date=March 27, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tougaloo.edu/content/newsevents/pressreleases/mcinnis%20march%2008%20press%20release.pdf |title=TOUGALOO COLLEGE STUDENT SELECTED AS A 2008 TRUMAN SCHOLAR |work=[[Tougaloo College]] |date=March 31, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other successful professionals working in the legal, business, education, non-profit and artistic sectors.

The '''International Communication Association''' ('''ICA''') is an academic association for scholars interested in the study, teaching and application of all aspects of human and mediated communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icahdq.org/about_ica/index.asp |title=About ICA |publisher=International Communication Association |work=www.icahdq.org |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began more than 60 years ago as a small organization of U.S. researchers and now is truly international with more than 4500 members in over 85 countries. The Association maintains an active membership of more than 4,500 individuals in 85 countries, approximately two-thirds of whom are academic scholars, professors, and graduate students. Other members are in government, the media, communication technology, business law, medicine and other professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~ica/ |title=International Communication Association Online |publisher=[[University of Southern California]] |work=www-bcf.usc.edu |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICA also has 59 institutional members (i.e. university departments or related institutions)and a growing number (16) of association members (i.e. communication associations around the world).

ICA is headquartered in Washington, D.C, United States. Since 2003, ICA has been officially associated with the United Nations as a non-governmental organization (NGO).

==History==
ICA was founded on January 1, 1950 in [[Austin, Texas]] as the National Society for the Study of Communication (NSSC), a subsidiary organization of the Speech Association of America (now the (United States) [[National Communication Association]]), when the SSA determined to exclude basic communication studies from its primary focus on rhetoric. The following year, NSSC published the first issue of its official journal, ''Journal of Communication''.

In 1967, the NSSC formally separated from the SSA and opened its membership to scholars outside of the U.S.  It changed its name two years later to the International Communication Association. The association restructured into divisions to allow members to find and interact with colleagues who shared similar research interests, among the widely diverse disciplines of communication study.

In the face of increasing internationalization, ICA relocated its offices from Austin, TX to the more cosmopolitan and globally accessible Washington, D.C. in 2001. The association purchased a permanent headquarters in Washington in 2006.

==Governance==
&lt;!--commenting out deleted image [[Image:ICA headquarters DC.JPG|thumb|right|200px|ICA's office building in Washington, D.C.]]--&gt;
ICA is governed by a Board of Directors, consisting of:

* the Executive Committee – President, Presidents-Elect and -Elect Select, the three immediate past Presidents – the least recent of whom serves as Finance Chair – and the Executive Director.
* Five Board Members-at-Large, representing five international regions as defined by [[UNESCO]]: the Americas; Europe; East Asia; West &amp; South Asia; and Africa-Oceania.
* Two graduate student representatives.
* The chairs of ICA's Divisions and Interest Groups (although Interest Group representatives do not have voting rights).

The officers (except for the [[Executive Director]]) are elected by the association's members. The balloting for President and regional Members-at-Large is association-wide; student representatives are elected by ICA's student members, while Division and Interest Group chairs are chosen by the Division/Interest Group members. Terms of office begin and end at the conclusion of each year's annual ICA conference.

The president of ICA serves a one-year term; however, the Executive Committee's makeup of incoming and past presidents means that election as ICA president brings with it a six-year commitment to serve on the Executive Committee. The current (2017–2018) president is Paula Gardner ([[McMaster University]]), and the current President-Elect is Patricia Moy ([[University of Washington]]). Past presidents include Peng Hwa Ang ([[Nanyang Technological University]]), Amy Jordan ([[University of Pennsylvania]]), and [[Peter Vorderer]] ([[University of Mannheim]]).

ICA maintains a series of standing and awards committees to conduct its business in relation to membership, internationalization, publications, liaison with other agencies, etc., annual awards, and ad hoc task forces. Committee members are appointed by the president.

The association is administered by the five-member staff at ICA's offices in Washington, D.C. The staff is led by the Executive Director, a position held since 2016 by Laura Sawyer.

==Divisions and Interest Groups==
ICA's members are drawn from several disciplines, focuses, and approaches to the communication discipline. Its membership is thus organized into Divisions and Interest Groups that gather scholars and students of common research interests into formal structures within the association.

New "Interest Groups" are formed when  a group of 30 or more active members of the association may petition the Executive Director to establish an Interest Group. An interest group appoints its own officers, is allocated conference sessions, and is represented in the Board of Directors, but does not have voting rights.

An interest group enrolling at least 1 percent of the members of ICA for at least two consecutive years may apply to become a "Division". A division also appoints its own offices, and is allocated conference sessions, but unlike Interest Groups, Divisions are granted voting status on the Board of Directors.

As of 2017 there are 23 Divisions and 9 Interest Groups within the association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icahdq.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference==
ICA sponsors a large annual conference for its members to present research representing the latest advances in the field of communication. The conference is held in a different city each year, with every fourth year's conference located outside of North America.

Each year's conference has a theme, around which the conference planners organize discussion panels designed to integrate and promote discovery, learning, and engagement as panelists and audience members from different regions of the world take up the conversation on particular topics. The conference also includes annual [[plenary session]]s featuring panels or keynote speakers. One of the plenaries is the Interactive Paper Session, in which participants display their work in the form of visual poster presentations and are awarded based on both the merit of their research and the visual quality of their presentations.

In addition, each of ICA's Divisions and Interest Groups organizes presentations and panels that explore the advancements within those Divisions' research focuses. These sessions often examine the conference theme from the aspects of the Divisions/Interest Groups.

ICA's President-Elect is head of the planning committee for the conference immediately following his/her election, and acts as the chair of that conference.

==Publications==
The International Communication Association's publishing partner is [[Oxford University Press]].

'''Job rotation''' is a technique used by some employers to rotate their employees' assigned jobs throughout their employment. Employers practice this technique for a number of reasons. It was designed to promote flexibility of employees and to keep employees interested into staying with the company/organization which employs them. There is also research that shows how job rotations help relieve the stress of employees who work in a job that requires manual labor.

==Objectives==

=== What are the objectives? ===
[[File:Job roto objective chart.jpg|thumb|This chart illustrates the Objectives for Job Rotation]]
#Employee Learning
##Rotation making employees more versatile
##Gives employees a broader understanding of the business allowing them to be better prepared to be promoted to management.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
#Employer Learning
##Using job rotation employers can learn their individual worker's strengths
##Employers receive a flexible and knowledgeable workforce that can be sourced throughout the company or agency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
#Employee Motivation 
##Rotation reduces boredom&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Eriksson, Tor, and Jaime Ortega. "The Adoption of Job Rotation: Testing the Theories". Industrial and Labor Relations Review 59.4 (2006): 653–666. Web...&lt;/ref&gt;
##More knowledge of the company as a whole may lead to more promotions.

=== Who Benefits? ===

Along with the company providing the opportunities and training for job rotation, the employees who participate in job rotation learn more than the one job specification deemed to them, benefiting them in the long run in case of an open position on moving up in the company or a position opening up in another firm. Along with employees benefiting, companies benefit as well. The business can hire fewer people since the majority of their staff will be able to be versatile in the job functions that the company may demand, saving the company more money and possibly giving the current employees a better salary.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Arya, Anil, and Brian Mittendorf. "Using Optional Job Rotation Programs to Gauge On-the-job Learning". Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) / Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft 162.3 (2006): 505–515. https://www.jstor.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Job rotation is beneficial to the company in terms of productivity and reducing the leave of absence workers take throughout the year. A study was conducted to see what motivates employees in their job performance. Job security was among the least motivators. Employees wanted a sense of responsibility and pride in their tasks performed. Job rotation was created for small crews to see if the company could produce a greater employee satisfaction, desire to become comfortable in their job functions, and decrease the desire to avoid their overtime duty.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, John H.. “Productivity Gains Through Job Reorganization and Rotation”. Journal (American Water Works Association) 73.12 (1981): 622–623. Web...&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==

=== Why is job rotation beneficial? ===

Some employees are paid more for they are presenting that they are worth a greater amount since they can perform more than one job function and thus makes a higher incentive for more employees to be able to perform better in the workplace. 
It is a common perception to see that employees who normally opt into the program of job rotation that these individuals tend to have  "higher perceived skills"&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; and are more likely to be promoted.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Sometimes job rotation is practiced for the individual worker's health benefit. This practice helps rotates the individual tasks and muscle movements. It reduces the stress of an average workday so that the workers do not feel the tension in their muscles as well as can keep up in their demanding workplace. There has been [[Electromyography|electromyographic]] studies on this technique from mining to assembly lines.&lt;ref&gt;Bengt Johnson, “Electromyographic Studies of Job Rotation,” Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health Vol 14 (May 1988):108-109.https://www.jstor.org/stable/40958847
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Job rotation in action ==

=== Semco Partners ===
Semco is a Brazilian firm known for implementing job rotation in order to discourage key people from keeping trade secrets which might get lost should they leave, and because it forces the company to develop more than one expert in any particular field.

=== [[Mazda Motor Corporation|Toyo Kogyo Company]] ===
Toyo Kogyo Company is the Japanese firm that now produces Mazda automobiles. Toyo Kogyo has been practicing job rotation for over 20 years as a direct result of the oil embargo of the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/12/business/how-job-rotation-works-for-japanese.html|title=HOW JOB ROTATION WORKS FOR JAPANESE|last=Times|first=Steve Lohr, Special To The New York|date=1982-07-12|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toyo looked to job rotation to fill gaps in experience due to the cutbacks needed during a downturn in the economy. This has resulted in company with a very efficient workforce that is more knowledgeable that their more specialized competitors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== [[Intel|Intel Corporation]] ===
Intel Corporation now uses job rotation as a means to fill temporary positions from within their own organization. In 11 months Intel filled about 1300 jobs lasting from weeks to years. These positions were available in various fields such as HR, Marketing, Finance and Product development.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204059804577229123891255472|title=Co-Workers Change Places|last=Weber|first=Lauren|date=2012-02-21|last2=Kwoh|first2=Leslie|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These assignments are meant to rein in restless workers as well as giving opportunities to employees to learn new technologies and strategies that they may not have been familiar with before. Many employees who experience this form of job rotation are given looks into fields that may be foreign letting them have a greater understanding of the company as a whole.

=== [[Virgin America]] ===
Virgin America has experimented with a one-year employee exchange program with [[Virgin Australia]]. The two companies traded flight attendants between each other to create excitement and energy among its employees.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; While trades are not as beneficial as job rotation among skill employees the short term benefits may help customer service and the general mood of the employees working for the airline.

== Workers ==

=== Benefits ===
Job rotation may also be used to alleviate the physical and mental stresses endured by employees when working at the same position, year after year. By allowing employees to rotate to other positions, the risk factors for some types of musculoskeletal disorders may be reduced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Job Rotation is also believed to have the ability to decrease the amount of boredom and monotony experienced by employees who work the same position for extended periods of time. Job rotation caters to the employee's preferences in a variety of tasks, letting them be more flexible in their positions while endowing workers with a wide range of skills. This also allows the worker job security by developing multiple skills instead of specializing in one aspect. In times of urgency or emergency employees in job rotation are prepared to deal with unusual operations other more specialized workers may not be able to.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Coşgel, Metin M., and Thomas J. Miceli. 1999. "Job Rotation: Cost, Benefits, and Stylized Facts". Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) / Zeitschrift Für Die Gesamte Staatswissenschaft 155 (2). Mohr Siebeck GmbH &amp; Co. KG: 301–20. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40752141.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drawbacks ===
There are some negative attributes associated with job rotation. Firstly, some positions within a company may not be eligible for rotation. There may be positions within a company that may be specialized due to technology or may require highly skilled workers.&lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt; These positions may not fit the profile for rotation opportunities because of the costs involved to train the workers. Another problem faced by companies is that some employ unionized workers that may be resistant to job rotation due to standard union practices.&lt;sup&gt;[10]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Private sector ==

=== Benefits ===
Employers are able to evaluate employees not only for their output but also for their personality traits and team work skills. "Output measures may easily be translated into attributes such as leadership abilities, technical competence, relations with others and judgement."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hatvany, Nina, and Vladimir Pucik. 1981. "An Integrated Management System: Lessons from the Japanese Experience". The Academy of Management Review 6 (3). Academy of Management: 469–80. https://www.jstor.org/stable/257382.&lt;/ref&gt; Job rotation benefits the private sector by allowing workers to become flexible in skills needed throughout the company not just in one section or division, this allows companies to benefit through lower costs of needing to train new employees to do the same job.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; There are different reasons a company may choose to use job rotation such as using job rotation as a learning mechanism. Research suggests that there are significant benefits that may out weigh the costs involved with training employees for diversified positions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This employment opportunity has an effect of boosting morale and self efficacy.&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt; The company may benefit from using job rotation by having the ability to staff key positions within a company that are needed at the moment instead of having to train a specialist to fill an urgent position. This practice may allow a company to run more efficiently, and as a result, become more productive and profitable.

=== Drawbacks ===

==== Cost of Job Rotation ====
The cost of job rotation can be directly linked to the productive gains made through specialization.

Theory determining the benefit to [[division of labour|specialization]]-

(1) Y=f(XuX2).&lt;blockquote&gt;"We will refer to the inputs as "jobs" that must be performed in order to produce the output. Suppose the firm employees two (initially) identical workers, each of whom is capable of performing both jobs. Thus in a two-period model, each worker could produce the same amount in the first period. By assuming the workers are identical in their intrinsic skills, we focus on the effect of the organization of work related skills. According to a well-known principle spelled out by Adam Smith, a specialized worker improves his or her skill over time by repetitively performing the same task. The gain from specializations thus arises in the second period if workers remain in the same job for both periods. In that case, we assume that the with the second period that his or her counterpart had produced in the first period.{{clarification needed|date=August 2017}} To capture this we let Y1 denote the total output in the first period, and Y2, and Y2, denote the output in the second period under rotation and specialization respectively. When workers rotate jobs in the second period, Y2,= Y1; when the specialize and remain in the same job, Y2&gt;Y1. Specialization thus yields greater output over the two periods by the amount Y2-Y2. This differential represents the cost of job rotation in terms of forgone output."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A problem faced by companies is the possibility of having to pay incentives to workers for cooperation with the job rotation implementation which can lead towards inequality.&lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt;The utilization of job rotation may have the effect of reducing a workforce due to the cross-training involved; a company may not be required to hire additional staff to cover positions and may cause a layoff of current employees no longer considered necessary.

== Public sector ==

=== Benefits ===
Job rotation in the public sector can be used to create communication networks between agencies. This is a benefit for agencies this in times of interagency involvement, or times of emergency.[[File:Job rotation flow.jpg|thumb|Successful Interagency Rotation Programs—A Win-Win for Participating Individuals and Organizations]]&lt;blockquote&gt;"Interagency assignments can promote networks among personnel from the host and home agencies. Job rotation programs can be designed with a formal component to encourage networking, or networks can be established informally through day-to-day interactions between the individual and his or her peers at the host agency."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Depending on the assignment, an individual can build specific skills needed for interagency collaboration, such as how to plan, lead, and execute interagency efforts. Several experts contend that the best way to teach people to lead in a collaborative environment is to provide them with an opportunity to do so."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;CRAIG, LAURA MILLER, and JESSICA NIERENBERG. 2014. "Interagency Rotation Programs: Professional Development for Future Enterprise Leaders". In Tackling Wicked Government Problems: A Practical Guide for Developing Enterprise Leaders, edited by JACKSON NICKERSON and RONALD SANDERS, 2nd ed., 141–52. Brookings Institution Press. https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7864/j.ctt7zsvkw.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drawbacks ===
Drawbacks from Job Rotation in the public sector are often affected the most by lack of cooperation between the agencies involved. Each agency must come into the project fully or the project is likely to fail; making these projects often hard to create or manage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Uneven exchanged in workforce talent can occur when one agency sends skilled personnel to another agency only to receive lower skilled personnel in return. This not only affects the consistency of work coming out of the first agency, but also has the effect of making managers more apprehensible to the aspect of future programs. Employees in these situations oftentimes feel that their careers are put on hold the moment they participate in rotation. Employees feel their contributions at other agencies will not be valued as much by their home agency. Employees feel they will be looked over and miss future opportunities due to lack of recognition and difference in location.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"These programs are not easy to design and manage effectively, and can impose significant costs on the individuals and organizations involved. Cultural differences that exist among different agencies, funding streams, and authorities that flow toward a single agency rather than toward enterprise-level goals are additional factors that complicate agencies’ abilities to work together to design a win-win program."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''John Hiram Lathrop''' (January 22, 1799 – August 2, 1866) was a well-known American educator during the early 19th century .  He served as the first President of both the [[University of Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/president/former.shtml |title=Former Presidents {{!}} Office of the President {{!}} University of Missouri&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}{{dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] as well as president of [[Indiana University]].

==Early life==
John Lathrop was born in [[Sherburne, New York]] in 1799.  He attended [[Yale University]], graduating in 1819 and teaching for three years at [[Farmington, Connecticut]].  He later became a tutor at his [[alma mater]] from 1822 until 1826 when he was admitted to the bar and practiced at [[Middletown, Connecticut]].  He also spent some time teaching in [[Norwich, Vermont]] and [[Gardiner, Maine]].  In 1829 he became professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]].

He was married to Frances E. Lothrop [sic]  student of [[Sarah Pierce]]'s [[Litchfield Female Academy]].  Her mother was a sister to Harvard University president [[John Thornton Kirkland]] and daughter of [[Samuel Kirkland]], founder of Hamilton College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=LAT&amp;GSpartial=1&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSst=26&amp;GScntry=4&amp;GSsr=681&amp;GRid=62172666&amp; |title=Frances E. Lathrop Lathrop |work=[[Find a Grave]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His son is Gardiner Lathrop who was founder of the Kansas City law firm [[Lathrop &amp; Gage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vintagekansascity.com/menwhomadekc/lathrop_gardiner.html |title=Gardiner Lathrop |work=Men Who Made Kansas City (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
===First term at the University of Missouri===
The University of Missouri was founded in 1839 as the first public or state university west of the [[Mississippi River]].  Professor Lathrop was chosen as its first president in 1840, a position he held until 1849.  He is credited with laying the foundations for the university's first century.

===University of Wisconsin===
In 1849, Lathrop was elected the first [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. During his tenure as chancellor, he established the academic setting at the university, and he recommended the university's seal and motto, "Numen Lumen." He was nominated for the position of first [[President of the University of Michigan]] in 1852 after [[Henry Barnard]] declined the job, but [[Henry Philip Tappan]] was elected instead. He resigned in 1858 due to problems with the regents and legislature, but remained the acting chancellor until Henry Barnard officially became the chancellor in 1859.

===Indiana University===
Upon the death of Indiana University's first president [[Andrew Wylie (college president)|Andrew Wylie]] in 1851, the Board of Trustees sought Lathrop as his replacement. Elsewhere occupied, he declined. Upon the abrupt departure of President [[William Mitchel Daily]] in 1859, the Indiana University Board of Trustees once again sought to fill the office with Lathrop. This time, he accepted, and took office on September 20, 1859. His inauguration took place July 11, 1860 and directly thereafter he submitted his resignation to the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Theophilus Adam Wylie |last=Wylie |first=Theophilus A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tL4oAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=theophilus%20Wylie%20indiana%20university&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions |title=Indiana University, Its History from 1820, when Founded, to 1890, with Biographical Sketches of Its Presidents, Professors and Graduates, and a List of Its Students from 1820 to 1887  |location=[[Indianapolis, Indiana]] |publisher=Wm. B. Burford |year=1890 |page=71 |via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second term at the University of Missouri===
After resigning the presidency of [[Indiana University]] in 1859 after only one year, he returned to the University of Missouri as a professor of English literature.  He was re-elected president in 1865, the only president ever to hold two separate terms, and held that office until his death in [[Columbia, Missouri]] in 1866.  He is buried in Columbia at the [[Columbia Cemetery (Columbia, Missouri)|Columbia Cemetery]]&lt;ref name="Spirits"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mautino |first=Nicole |title=Spirits of Mizzou |work=University Archives |publisher=University of Missouri | date=2008-04-15 |url=http://muarchives.missouri.edu/exh_mu_cemetery.html |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong''''' is a 1995 book by [[James W. Loewen]], a  sociologist. It critically examines twelve popular American [[high school]] history textbooks and concludes that the textbook authors propagate false, [[Eurocentric]] and [[mythology|mythologized]] views of [[History of the United States|American history]]. In addition to his critique of the dominant historical themes presented in high school textbooks, Loewen presents themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. A revised hardcover edition was released on April 1, 2008.

==Themes==
In ''Lies My Teacher Told Me'',  Loewen criticizes modern American high school history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people  and events such as [[Christopher Columbus]], the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their "bland" and simplistic style. He proposes that when [[History of the United States|American history]] textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of [[hero]]es, they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past. In other words, the history-as-myth method teaches students that America's greatest days have already passed. Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students, especially groups excluded from the positive histories.&lt;ref&gt;Loewen, James. [http://www.ushistory.org/us/historians/loewen.asp Interview by ushistory.org]. 12 May 2000. Web. 21 Aug 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5545">The system on [[Education in Austria#Higher education|higher education in Austria]] distinguishes between '''federal universities''' (Universitäten), '''private universities''' (Privatuniversitäten) and '''universities of applied science''' (Fachhochschulen). The three types are based on different laws. One of the main differences (but not the only) is funding. Two institutions in Lower Austria have a special legal status. Since 2012 the Agentur für Qualitätssicherung und Akkreditierung Austria (AQ Austria) is responsible for [[educational accreditation]] of universities, except paedagogic.

{{quote|His novels, plays and short story collections have been likened, by the mainstream press, to the work of Beckett, Joyce, Kafka, Proust, Dostoevski and Swift, as well as Barth, Pynchon, Barthelme and Burroughts. I would add [[Thomas Bernhard]] and [[Italo Svevo]], for reasons of style and the formidable, original talent their texts exhibit.|Judith Upjohn|"#$%!: review of ***",''American Book Review'', v16, no5, Dec-Feb 1994-5}}

{{quote|It should be obvious to serious readers ... that Brodsky ... is a sensitive, original, and insightful writer, one of the best produced by this country in the last 30 years.|[[Harvey Pekar]]|[[Village Voice]], "An American Revisionary", review of ''Detour'' re-issue, 8/19/2003}}

===Highly negative===

{{quote|His latest deconstructionist experiment fails miserably, consisting almost entirely of the pathetic projections, obsessions, rationalizations, and delusions of a character we are not given the slightest reason to care about. A few scholarly avant-gardists, confused compulsives, and bibliomasochists will love this book.|Jim Dwyer, [[California State University, Chico|Cal State Chico]]|''Library Journal'', review of ''[[Three Goat Songs]]'', 1991}}

{{quote|It would be nice if the hapless reader didn't have to reach for the nearest bottle of Excedrin or take a nap between pages or could actually connect with a character or two in any of these frustratingly opaque stories.|[[Charles Salzberg]]|''[[New York Times]]'', review of ''Southernmost and other stories'', 3/9/1997}}

'''Minsk Radioengineering College''' ({{lang-be|Мі́нскі Радыётэхні́чны Кале́дж, Mínski Radyjotechníčny Kaliédž}}, {{lang-ru|link=no|Минский Радиотехнический колледж, Minskiy Radiotekhnicheskiy kolledzh}}) is an educational Institution of the [[Republic of Belarus]]. Training with secondary special education on the basis of basic education.

== History ==
In July 2, 1960 on the basis of the [[BSSR]] Council of Ministers Resolution № 383 "''Minsk Radio Engineering College''" was established. Having started its activities in the period of formation and development of the electronic industry in the Republic of Belarus, Radio Technical College is gradually transformed into a top college.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://mrk-bsuir.by/ru/content/istoriya-mrk История МРК]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1 September 1960 200 students started their studies in the newly opened Minsk Radio Technical School, the establishment of which was determined by the development of industrial production, which identified the need of the republic in skilled technical personnel. The first set of students was carried out in the field:
*Electronic computers, instruments and devices
*Radioapparatostroenie
*Manufacture of electronic components and materials
*Programming for High-speed mathematical machines

22 teachers are trained professionals for full-time and correspondence courses. Among them were veterans of the Great Patriotic War, including – Hero of the Soviet Union Ivan Eliseevich Sambuc.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 1991, there was an order of the Ministry of Public Education of the Republic of Belarus №144 from 17.06.91. "On the transformation of an experiment in Minsk Radio Technical School in the school of a new type, the college".&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 1995, the college was again reorganized and gained new status and name "The Minsk State Higher Radio Technical College".&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In November 1, 2015 Minsk State Higher Radio Technical College transformed into UO BSUIR branch "Minsk Radioengineering College".&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15465">The '''National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI)''' is a non-profit organization based in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], that launched in 2007. Its mission is to improve student performance in the subjects of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) in the [[United States]]. It attempts to do this by scaling up local academic programs to a national level.

==History of the Initiative==
In 2005, the National Academies commissioned a report titled “Rising Above the Gathering Storm” which asserts that student achievement in the subjects of math and science has declined in the United States, while other countries have increased their student achievement scores in the same subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/testimony/gathering_storm_energizing_and_employing_america2.asp |title=Rising Above The Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report recommended the creation of a non-profit organization to help marshal private sector support to help improve math and science education in the United States. Several authors of the report partnered with Peter O’Donnell Jr. to meet this need, effectively establishing NMSI’s board of directors and committing to bring both the [[UTeach]] and NMSI’s College Readiness program (formerly known as NMSI’s Comprehensive AP Program and the Advanced Placement Training and Incentive Program (APTIP)) to scale nationally. ExxonMobil invested $125 million to launch the effort,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/community/math-and-science/national-math-and-science-initiative/overview?parentId=bad0c112-6677-4324-bd39-c28aa7ed3237 |title=National Math and Science Initiative (ExonnMobil)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which was later supplemented by an additional $125 million from corporations, foundations, individual donors and government agencies – creating an effective public-private partnership model that continues to sustain the organization today.

==NMSI's Programs==
NMSI has expanded three programs to a national scale: [http://www.nms.org/Programs/CollegeReadinessProgram.aspx NMSI’s College Readiness Program], [http://www.nms.org/Programs/LayingtheFoundationProgram.aspx NMSI’s Laying the Foundation Program], and [http://www.nms.org/Education/UTeach.aspx NMSI's UTeach Expansion Program].

===NMSI’s College Readiness Program===
NMSI’s College Readiness Program is a three-year program in which teachers go through rigorous professional development to better prepare themselves and their students for Advanced Placement Exams.  The prototype for NMSI’s program, Advanced Placement Strategies (APS) was launched as a public-private partnership in the Dallas area in 1995 by a group of local businessmen committed to education reform. The goal of the APS program was to improve college readiness and encourage STEM studies for underserved Texas public high school students by increasing participation and performance in AP math, science and English courses. Texas schools in their first year of the APS program increased their exam participation by 198 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-109shrg26426/html/CHRG-109shrg26426.htm |title=PROTECTING AMERICA'S COMPETITIVE EDGE ACT (S. 2198): HELPING K-12 STUDENTS LEARN MATH AND SCIENCE BETTER}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008-2009 school year, NMSI replicated the APS program as the Advanced Placement Training and Incentive Program (APTIP) and in its first year, the program increased enrollment in AP courses by nearly 70 percent, including a 122 percent increase among African American and Hispanic students. The number of passing AP math, science, and English exams also increased by 52 percent, which was nine times the national average; for African American and Hispanic students, the increase in passing AP scores was 71.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100830005772/en/National-Math-Science-Initiative%E2%80%99s-Year-Results-Boost#.Uv1YHvldV8E |title=National Math and Science Initiative’s Year Two Results Boost Student Achievement by 98 Percent, Opening Doors to College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2012, APS officially merged with NMSI to bring this program to scale throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/advanced-placement-strategies-joins-national-math-and-science-168435816.html |title=Advanced Placement Strategies Joins National Math and Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 50,000 students are now enrolled in the NMSI College Readiness Program, and it is currently being implemented in more than 550 schools in 22 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/students-in-national-math-and-science-initiative-program-outperform-peers-on-advanced-placement-exams-for-fifth-consecutive-year-221483841.html |title=Students in National Math and Science Initiative Program Outperform Peers on Advanced Placement Exams for Fifth Consecutive Year}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent results show a continuing trend of student improvement. Over the life cycle of the NMSI program, the number of average passing scores on AP math, science and English exams increased by 144 percent, compared to 23.2 percent nationally. The average three-year increase in the number of passing math, science and English scores among minorities enrolled in the NMSI program is 219 percent compared to the national average of 48.5 percent. The number of average passing scores for females enrolled in the NMSI program increased by 87 percent, compared to 8.7 percent nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nms.org/Blog/TabId/58/PostId/163/students-in-national-math-and-science-initiative-program-outperform-peers-on-advanced-placement-exams-for-fifth-consecutive-year.aspx |title=Students in National Math and Science Initiative Program Outperform Peers on Advanced Placement Exams for Fifth Consecutive Year}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the organization received funding from the Lockheed Martin Corporation to launch the AP program in schools serving military bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100521005152/en/Lockheed-Martin-Corporation-Partners-National-Math-Science |title=Lockheed Martin Corporation Partners with the National Math and Science Initiative in Support of Children in Military Families}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden announced the expansion of the program as part of their national Joining Forces initiative, which aims to provide support and resources to military personnel and their families in the areas of employment, housing, health care, education, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.massinsight.org/news/213/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419025055/http://www.massinsight.org/news/213/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-04-19 |title=WHITE HOUSE CELEBRATES ANNIVERSARY OF JOINING FORCES, COMMENDS NMSI’S INITIATIVE FOR MILITARY FAMILIES }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Obama and Dr. Biden made the announcement at a community event at Fountain-Fort Carson High School in Fountain, Colo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox21news.com/news/story.aspx?id=605544#.UnloP_nkvO4 |title=First Lady visits school near Fort Carson}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2014, NMSI’s College Readiness Program is being implemented in 71 schools serving military families in 18 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nms.org/Blog/TabId/58/PostId/220/aberdeen-high-school-awarded-the-national-math-and-science-initiative-school-of-the-year.aspx |title=Aberdeen High School Awarded National Math and Science Initiative "School of the Year"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NMSI's Laying the Foundation Program===
In January 2012, NMSI merged with Laying the Foundation, an organization which focused on professional development for math, science, and English teachers, grades 6-12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111216005087/en/Laying-Foundation-Joins-National-Math-Science-Initiative |title=Laying the Foundation Joins National Math and Science Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the merge, NMSI’s Laying the Foundation teacher training program was expanded to include training for elementary teachers, grades 3-5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nms.org/Blog/TabId/58/PostId/128/freddie-kendrick-talks-elementary-education.aspx |title=NMSI’s Freddie Kendrick Talks Elementary Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, NMSI was selected to work with the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) consortium to lead Common Core State Standards training in 22 states and create the Educator Leader Cadre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nmsi-awarded-43-million-contract-to-lead-parcc-educator-leader-cadres-159403165.html |title=NMSI Awarded $4.3 Million Contract to Lead PARCC Educator Leader Cadres}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
In August 2013, NMSI received a $248,760 grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a series of web-based training modules for teachers who have attended NMSI’s Laying the Foundation Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/online-learning-modules-will-play-a-big-role-in-common-core-implementation-across-the-us-219405611.html |title=Online Learning Modules Will Play a Big Role in Common Core Implementation Across the U.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NMSI's UTeach Expansion Program===
The [[UTeach]] Program originated at The University of Texas at Austin in 1997, enabling students who are majoring in math, science, or computer science to receive full teaching certification without adding time or cost to their degrees. The national replication process is directed by NMSI in conjunction with the [[UTeach Institute]].

The NMSI-supported replication of the UTeach program for preparing teachers was launched in 2008 in 13 universities in nine states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Texas).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uteach-institute.org/images/uploads/implementation_summary_c1yr2_natl.pdf |title=National Replication of the UTeach Secondary STEM Teacher Preparation Program Implementation Highlights, Cohort 1, Year 2 (2009-2010) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506015641/http://www.uteach-institute.org/images/uploads/implementation_summary_c1yr2_natl.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Jan. 6, 2010, President Barack Obama mentioned the UTeach program at a White House education event, saying, “To bring more educators into the classroom, the National Math and Science Initiative is working with Texas Instruments and the Dell Foundation to prepare almost 5,000 new math and science teachers in the next five years -- through a program that allows young people to earn teaching certificates and science degrees at the same time.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2010/01/07/uteach_expansion/ |title=UTeach Expansion Recognized as President Obama Spotlights Importance of Teachers in Improving U.S. Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the UTeach Institute projects that 9,000 UTeach program graduates will have impacted 4.8 million secondary STEM students nationwide by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Graduates of  UTeach STEM Teacher  Preparation Programs|url=http://www.uteach-institute.org/files/uploads/uteach_grad_report_november_2013.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519184840/http://www.uteach-institute.org/files/uploads/uteach_grad_report_november_2013.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On February 4, 2014, it was announced that NMSI is expanding the program to 5 additional universities thanks to a $22.5 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, bringing the total number of UTeach Replication sites to 40 across 19 states. Another 5 will be added in 2015 through the HHMI funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nms.org/Blog/TabId/58/PostId/224/national-math-and-science-initiative-uteach-institute-and-howard-hughes-medical-institute-announce-national-expansion-of-highly-successful-uteach-program.aspx |title=National Math and Science Initiative, UTeach Institute and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Announce National Expansion of Highly Successful UTeach Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oswald Mathias Ungers''' (12 July 1926 &amp;ndash; 30 September 2007) was a German [[architect]] and [[architectural theory|architectural theorist]], known for his [[rationalism (architecture)|rationalist]] designs and the use of cubic forms. Among his notable projects are museums in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Cologne.

==Biography==
Oswald Mathias Ungers was born in [[Kaisersesch]] in the [[Eifel]] region. From 1947 to 1950 he studied architecture at the [[Universität Karlsruhe (TH)|University of Karlsruhe]] under [[Egon Eiermann]]. He set up an architectural practice in [[Cologne]] in 1950, and opened offices in [[Berlin]] in 1964, [[Frankfurt]] in 1974 and [[Karlsruhe]] in 1983.

He was a professor at the [[Technical University of Berlin]] from 1963 to 1967 and served as the dean of the faculty of architecture from 1965 to 1967. In 1968 he moved to the United States, where he became the chair of the department of architecture at [[Cornell University]] from 1969 to 1975. In 1971 he became a member of the [[American Institute of Architects]]. He was also a visiting professor at [[Harvard University]] (1973 and 1978) and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (1974/75). He returned to Germany in 1976, becoming a visiting professor at the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]] (1979/80) and a full professor at the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf]] (1986).

Oswald Mathias Ungers died on 30 September 2007 from [[pneumonia]]. He was married to Liselotte Gabler (1926–2010) and had one son ([[Simon Ungers]]) and two daughters.

'''Pascal''' is an [[Imperative programming|imperative]] and [[Procedural programming|procedural]] [[programming language]], which [[Niklaus Wirth]] designed in 1968–69 and published in 1970, as a small, efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using [[structured programming]] and [[data structure|data structuring]]. It is named in honor of the French mathematician, philosopher and physicist [[Blaise Pascal]].

Pascal was developed on the pattern of the [[ALGOL 60]] language. Wirth had already developed several improvements to this language as part of the [[ALGOL X]] proposals, but these were not accepted and Pascal was developed separately and released in 1970. A derivative known as [[Object Pascal]] designed for [[object-oriented programming]] was developed in 1985; this was used by [[Apple Computer]] and [[Borland]] in the late 1980s and later developed into [[Delphi (programming language)|Delphi]] on the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform. Extensions to the Pascal concepts led to the Pascal-like languages [[Modula-2]] and [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]].

==History==
===Earlier efforts===
Much of the history of [[computer language]] design during the 1960s traces its history to the [[ALGOL 60]] language. ALGOL was developed during the 1950s with the explicit goal to be able to clearly describe algorithms. It included a number of features for [[structured programming]] that remain common in languages to this day.

Shortly after its introduction, in 1962 Wirth began working on his dissertation with Helmut Weber on the [[Euler (programming language)|Euler programming language]]. Euler was based on ALGOL's syntax and many concepts but was not a derivative. Its primary goal was to add dynamic lists and types, allowing it to be used in roles similar to [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]. The language was published in 1965.

By this time, a number of problems in ALGOL had been identified, notably the lack of a standardized [[String (computer science)|string]] system. The group tasked with maintaining the language had begun the [[ALGOL X]] process to identify improvements, calling for submissions. Wirth and [[Tony Hoare]] submitted a conservative set of modifications to add strings and clean up some of the syntax. These were considered too minor to be worth using as the new standard ALGOL, so Wirth wrote a compiler for the language, which became known as [[ALGOL W]].

The ALGOL X efforts would go on to choose a dramatically more complex language, [[ALGOL 68]]. The complexity of this language led to considerable difficulty producing high-performance compilers, and it was not widely used in the industry. This left an opening for newer languages.

===Pascal===
Pascal was influenced by the ALGOL W efforts, with the explicit goals of producing a language that would be efficient both in the compiler and at run-time, allow for the development of well-structured programs, and to be useful for teaching students [[structured programming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcocantu.com/epascal/English/ch01hist.htm Essential Pascal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418215216/http://www.marcocantu.com/epascal/English/ch01hist.htm |date=2017-04-18 }} by Marco Cantù&lt;/ref&gt; A generation of students used Pascal as an introductory language in undergraduate courses.

One of the early successes for language was the introduction of [[UCSD Pascal]], a version that ran on a custom [[operating system]] that could be ported to different platforms. A key platform was the [[Apple II]], where it saw widespread use. This led to the use of Pascal becoming the primary high-level language used for development in the [[Apple Lisa]], and later, the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]. Parts of the original [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh operating system]] were hand-translated into [[Motorola 68000]] [[assembly language]] from the Pascal sources.&lt;ref&gt;Hertzfeld, Andy. "[http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Hungarian.txt&amp;topic=Software%20Design&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;detail=medium Hungarian folklore.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118082558/http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Hungarian.txt&amp;topic=Software%20Design&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;detail=medium |date=2015-11-18 }}: Macintosh Stories. Retrieved 2012-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[typesetting]] system [[TeX]] by [[Donald E. Knuth]] was written in [[WEB]], the original [[literate programming]] system, based on [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-10]] Pascal, while applications like [[Total Commander]], [[Skype]] and Macromedia Captivate were written in Delphi ([[Object Pascal]]). [[Apollo Computer]] used Pascal as the systems programming language for its operating systems beginning in 1980.

Variants of Pascal have also frequently been used for everything from research projects to [[PC game]]s and [[embedded systems]]. Newer Pascal compilers exist which are widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/ tiobe.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315012717/http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci |date=2012-03-15 }}, Programming Community Index for January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object Pascal===
During work on the Lisa, [[Larry Tesler]] began corresponding with Wirth on the idea of adding [[object oriented]] extensions to the language. This led initially to [[Clascal]], introduced in 1983. As the Lisa program faded and was replaced by the Mac, a further version known as [[Object Pascal]] was created. This was introduced on the Macintosh in 1985 as part of the [[MacApp]] [[application framework]], and became Apple's primary development language into the early 1990s.

The Object Pascal extensions were added to [[Turbo Pascal]] with the release of version 5.5 in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antique Software: Turbo Pascal v5.5|url=http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, Object Pascal became the basis of the [[Delphi (programming language)|Delphi]] system for [[Microsoft Windows]], which is still used for developing Windows applications, and can cross-compile code to other systems. [[Free Pascal]] is an open source, cross-platform alternative.

==Brief description==
Wirth's intention was to create an efficient language (regarding both compilation speed and generated code) based on [[structured programming]], a recently popularized concept that he promoted in his book ''[[Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs]]''. Pascal has its roots in the [[ALGOL 60]] language, but also introduced concepts and mechanisms which (on top of ALGOL's scalars and arrays) enabled programmers to define their own complex (structured) datatypes, and also made it easier to build dynamic and recursive data structures such as ''lists'', ''trees'' and ''graphs''. Important features included for this were ''records'', ''enumerations'', ''subranges'', ''dynamically'' allocated variables with associated ''pointers'', and ''sets''. To make this possible and meaningful, Pascal has a [[strong typing]] on all objects, which means that one type of data cannot be converted or interpreted as another without ''explicit'' conversions. Similar mechanisms are standard in many programming languages today. Other languages that influenced Pascal's development were [[Simula]] 67 and Wirth's own [[ALGOL W]].

Pascal, like many programming languages of today (but unlike most languages in the C family), allows [[nested procedure]] definitions to any level of depth, and also allows most kinds of definitions and declarations inside [[subroutines]] (procedures and functions). This enables a very simple and coherent syntax where a complete ''program'' is syntactically nearly identical to a single ''procedure'' or ''function'' (except for the heading, which has one of these three keywords).

==Implementations==

===Early Pascal compilers===
The first Pascal [[compiler]] was designed in [[Zürich]] for the [[CDC 6000 series]] [[mainframe computer]] family. [[Niklaus Wirth]] reports that a first attempt to implement it in [[Fortran]] in 1969 was unsuccessful due to Fortran's inadequacy to express complex data structures. The second attempt was implemented in a C-like language (Scallop by Max Engeli) and then translated by hand (by R. Schild) to Pascal itself for boot-strapping.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/Miscellaneous/ComputersAndComputing.pdf Computers and Computing. A Personal Perspective.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510101203/https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/Miscellaneous/ComputersAndComputing.pdf |date=2017-05-10 }} by Niklaus Wirth&lt;/ref&gt; It was operational by mid-1970. Many Pascal compilers since have been similarly [[self-hosting]], that is, the compiler is itself written in Pascal, and the compiler is usually capable of recompiling itself when new features are added to the language, or when the compiler is to be [[porting|ported]] to a new environment.  The [[GNU Pascal]] compiler is one notable exception, being written in C.

The first successful port of the CDC Pascal compiler to another mainframe was completed by Welsh and Quinn at the [[Queen's University of Belfast]] (QUB) in 1972.  The target was the [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] [[ICT 1900 series|1900 series]]. This compiler, in turn, was the parent of the Pascal compiler for the Information Computer Systems (ICS) [[Multum]] minicomputer. The Multum port was developed&amp;nbsp;– with a view to using Pascal as a systems programming language&amp;nbsp;– by Findlay, Cupples, Cavouras and Davis, working at the Department of Computing Science in [[Glasgow University]]. It is thought that Multum Pascal, which was completed in the summer of 1973, may have been the first 16-bit implementation.

A completely new compiler was completed by Welsh et al. at QUB in 1977. It offered a source-language diagnostic feature (incorporating profiling, tracing and type-aware formatted postmortem dumps) that was implemented by Findlay and Watt at Glasgow University. This implementation was ported in 1980 to the [[ICL 2900]] series by a team based at [[Southampton University]] and Glasgow University. The Standard Pascal Model Implementation was also based on this compiler, having been adapted, by Welsh and Hay at [[Manchester University]] in 1984, to check rigorously for conformity to the BSI 6192/ISO 7185 Standard and to generate code for a portable abstract machine.

The first Pascal [[compiler]] written in North America was constructed at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]] under [[Donald B. Gillies#Later career|Donald B. Gillies]] for the [[PDP-11]] and generated native machine code.

==={{anchor|Pascal-P}}The Pascal-P system===
To propagate the language rapidly, a compiler "porting kit" was created in Zurich that included a compiler that generated code for a "virtual" stack machine, ''i.e.'', code that lends itself to reasonably efficient interpretation, along with an interpreter for that code&amp;nbsp;– the ''Pascal-P'' system. The P-system compilers were termed Pascal-P1, [[Pascal-P2]], Pascal-P3, and Pascal-P4. Pascal-P1 was the first version, and Pascal-P4 was the last to come from Zurich. The version termed Pascal-P1 was coined after the fact for the many different sources for Pascal-P that existed. The compiler was redesigned to enhance portability, and issued as Pascal-P2. This code was later enhanced to become Pascal-P3, with an intermediate code [[backward compatible]] with Pascal-P2, and Pascal-P4, which was not backward compatible.

The Pascal-P4 compiler/interpreter can still be run and compiled on systems compatible with original Pascal. However, it only accepts a subset of the Pascal language.

Pascal-P5, created outside the Zurich group, accepts the full Pascal language and includes ISO 7185 compatibility.

[[UCSD Pascal]] branched off Pascal-P2, where [[Kenneth Bowles]] utilized it to create the [[Interpreter (computing)|interpretive]] [[UCSD Pascal|UCSD p-System]]. The UCSD p-System was one of three operating systems available at the launch of the original [[IBM Personal Computer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbi.umn.edu/oh/pdf/oh392jb.pdf cbi.umn.edu], "An Interview with JOHN BRACKETT AND DOUG ROSS"{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p15, Charles Babbage Institute, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; UCSD Pascal used an intermediate code based on byte values, and thus was one of the earliest "byte code compilers". Pascal-P1 through Pascal-P4 was not, but rather based on the CDC 6600 60 bit word length.

A compiler based on the Pascal-P4 compiler, which created native binaries, was released for the [[IBM System/370]] [[mainframe computer]] by the [[Australian Atomic Energy Commission]]; it was called the "AAEC Pascal Compiler" after the abbreviation of the name of the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/10/477/10477561.pdf iaea.org], "AUSTRALIAN ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION RESEARCH ESTABLISHMENT, LUCAS HEIGHTS, NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY BRANCH REPORT 1977, DIVISIONAL RESEARCH", p.22, International Atomic Energy Agency (IEAE)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, [[Watcom]] Pascal was developed, also for the IBM [[System 370]].

Into the 1990s, Pascal was still running on [[VAX]] terminals at [[George Mason University]] to teach computer programming.

===Object Pascal and Turbo Pascal===
Apple Computer created its own Lisa Pascal for the Lisa Workshop in 1982, and ported the compiler to the Apple Macintosh and [[Macintosh Programmer's Workshop|MPW]] in 1985. In 1985 [[Larry Tesler]], in consultation with Niklaus Wirth, defined Object Pascal and these extensions were incorporated in both the Lisa Pascal and Mac Pascal compilers.

In the 1980s, [[Anders Hejlsberg]] wrote the Blue Label Pascal compiler for the [[Nascom]]-2. A reimplementation of this compiler for the [[IBM PC]] was marketed under the names Compas Pascal and PolyPascal before it was acquired by [[Borland]] and renamed ''Turbo Pascal''.

[[Turbo Pascal]] became hugely popular, thanks to an aggressive pricing strategy, having one of the first full-screen IDEs, and very fast turnaround time (just seconds to compile, link, and run). It was written and highly optimized entirely in [[assembly language]], making it [[Memory footprint|smaller]] and faster than much of the competition.

In 1986, Anders ported Turbo Pascal to the Macintosh and incorporated Apple's Object Pascal extensions into Turbo Pascal. These extensions were then added back into the PC version of Turbo Pascal for version 5.5. At the same time [[Microsoft]] also implemented the Object Pascal compiler.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Udell, Crash of the Object-Oriented Pascals, BYTE, July, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.I.Trofimov, The End of Pascal?, BYTE, March, 1990, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; Turbo Pascal 5.5 had a large influence on the Pascal community, which began concentrating mainly on the IBM PC in the late 1980s. Many PC hobbyists in search of a structured replacement for BASIC used this product. It also began to be adopted by professional developers. Around the same time a number of concepts were imported from [[C (programming language)|C]] to let Pascal programmers use the C-based [[Application programming interface|API]] of [[Microsoft Windows]] directly. These extensions included null-terminated [[string (computer science)|string]]s, [[pointer arithmetic]], [[function pointer]]s, an address-of operator and unsafe [[type conversion|typecasts]].

Turbo Pascal, and other derivatives with [[Unit (Software Development)|units]] or module concepts are [[modularity (programming)|modular languages]]. However, it does not provide a nested module concept or qualified import and export of specific symbols.

==={{anchor|Pascal-SC|Pascal-XSC}}Other variants===
[[Super Pascal]] is a variant that added non-numeric labels, a return statement and expressions as names of types.

Pascal-XSC has at various times been ported to Unix (Linux, [[SunOS]], [[HP-UX]], [[AIX]]) and Microsoft/IBM (DOS with [[EMX (programming environment)|EMX]], OS/2, [[Windows]]) operating systems. It operates by generating intermediate C source code which is then compiled to a native executable. Some of the Pascal-SC language extensions have been adopted by [[GNU Pascal]].

Pascal Sol was designed around 1983 by a French team to implement a Unix-like systems named Sol.  It was standard Pascal level-1 (with parametrized array bounds) but the definition allowed alternative keywords and predefined identifiers in French and the language included a few extensions to ease system programming (e.g. an equivalent to lseek).&lt;ref&gt;Michel Gien, "The SOL Operating System", in Usenix Summer '83 Conference, Toronto, ON, (July 1983), pp. 75-78&lt;/ref&gt; The Sol team later on moved to the [[ChorusOS]] project to design a distributed operating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~prabal/resources/osprelim/RAA+92.pdf cs.berkeley.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207194433/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~prabal/resources/osprelim/RAA+92.pdf |date=2015-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IP Pascal]] was an implementation of the Pascal programming language using [[Micropolis (company)|Micropolis]] DOS, but was moved rapidly to [[CP/M-80]] running on the Z80. It was moved to the [[80386]] machine types in 1994, and exists today as Windows/XP and Linux implementations. In 2008, the system was brought up to a new level and the resulting language termed "Pascaline" (after [[Pascal's calculator]]). It includes objects, namespace controls, [[dynamic array]]s, along with many other extensions, and generally features the same functionality and type protection as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]. It is the only such implementation that is also compatible with the original Pascal implementation, which is standardized as ISO 7185.

Pascal, in its original form, is a purely [[procedural language]] and includes the traditional array of [[ALGOL]]-like control structures with reserved words such as '''if''', '''then''', '''else''', '''while''', '''for''', and '''case''' ranging on a single statement or a '''begin'''-'''end''' statements block. Pascal also has data structuring constructs not included in the original [[ALGOL 60]] [[type system|types]], like [[Record (computer science)|record]]s, variants, [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s, [[enumerated type|enumeration]]s, and [[set (computer science)|set]]s and procedure/pointers. Such constructs were in part inherited or inspired from [[Simula]] 67, [[ALGOL 68]], [[Niklaus Wirth]]'s own [[ALGOL W]] and suggestions by [[C. A. R. Hoare]].

Pascal programs start with the '''program''' [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]] with a list of external [[file descriptor]]s as parameters&lt;ref name="iso/iec 7185:1990 6.10"&gt;[http://www.moorecad.com/standardpascal/iso7185.pdf Pascal ISO 7185:1990] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617105237/http://www.moorecad.com/standardpascal/iso7185.pdf |date=2012-06-17 }} 6.10&lt;/ref&gt; (not required in Turbo Pascal etc.); then follows the main [[block (programming)|block]] bracketed by the '''begin''' and '''end''' keywords. [[Semicolon]]s separate [[Statement (programming)|statements]], and the [[full stop]] (i.e., a period) ends the whole program (or ''unit''). [[Letter case]] is ignored in Pascal source.

Here is an example of the source code in use for a very simple [["Hello world" program]]:

&lt;source lang=pascal&gt;
program HelloWorld(output);
begin
  Write('Hello, world!')
  {no ";" is required after the last statement of a block -
   adding one adds a "null statement" to the program;}
end.
&lt;/source&gt;

===Data types===
A type in Pascal, and in several other popular programming languages,  defines a variable in such a way that it defines a range of values which the variable is capable of storing, and it also defines a set of operations that are permissible to be performed on variables of that type. The predefined types are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Data type
! Type of values which the variable is capable of storing
|-
| [[integer (computer science)|integer]]
| integer (whole) numbers
|-
| [[floating point|real]]
| floating-point numbers
|-
| [[boolean type|boolean]]
| the values True or False
|-
| [[character (computing)|char]]
| a single character from an ordered character set
|-
| [[string (computer science)|string]]
| a sequence or "string" of characters
|-
| [[set (computer science)|set]]
| equivalent to an array of [[boolean type|boolean]] values
|}

The range of values allowed for each (except boolean) is implementation defined. Functions are provided for some data conversions. For conversion of &lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt;, the following functions are available: &lt;code&gt;round&lt;/code&gt; (which rounds to integer using [[banker's rounding]]) and &lt;code&gt;trunc&lt;/code&gt; (rounds towards zero).

The programmer has the freedom to define other commonly used data types (e.g. byte, string, etc.) in terms of the predefined types using Pascal's type declaration facility, for example

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
type
  byte        = 0..255;
  signed_byte = -128..127;
  string      = packed array[1..255] of char;
&lt;/source&gt;

(Often-used types like byte and string are already defined in many implementations.)

===Subrange types===
Subranges of any [[ordinal data type]] (any simple type except real) can also be made:

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
var
  x : 1..10;
  y : 'a'..'z';
&lt;/source&gt;

===Set types===
In contrast with other programming languages from its time,{{cn|date=May 2018}} Pascal supports a set type:

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
var
  Set1 : set of 1..10;
  Set2 : set of 'a'..'z';
&lt;/source&gt;

A set is a fundamental concept for modern mathematics, and they may be used in many algorithms. Such a feature is useful and may be faster than an equivalent construct in a language that does not support sets. For example, for many Pascal compilers:

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
if i in [5..10] then ...
&lt;/source&gt;

executes faster than:

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
if (i &gt; 4) and (i &lt; 11) then ...
&lt;/source&gt;

Sets of non-contiguous values can be particularly useful, in terms of both performance and readability:

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
if i in [0..3, 7, 9, 12..15] then ...
&lt;/source&gt;

For these examples, which involve sets over small domains, the improved performance is usually achieved by the compiler representing set variables as bit vectors. The set [[Operator (programming)|operators]] can then be implemented efficiently as bitwise machine code operations.

===Type declarations===
Types can be defined from other types using type declarations:

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
type
  x = integer;
  y = x;
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Further, complex types can be constructed from simple types:

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
type
  a = array[1..10] of integer;
  b = record
        x : integer;
        y : char
      end;
  c = file of a;
&lt;/source&gt;

===File type===
As shown in the example above, Pascal [[Computer file|files]] are sequences of components. Every file has a buffer variable which is denoted by ''f^''. The procedures ''get'' (for reading) and ''put'' (for writing) move the buffer variable to the next element. Read is introduced such that ''read(f, x)'' is the same as ''x := f^;  get(f);''. Write is introduced such that ''write(f, x)'' is the same as ''f^ := x;  put(f);'' The type text is predefined as file of char. While the buffer variable could be used for inspecting the next character to be used (check for a digit before reading an integer), this leads to serious problems with interactive programs in early implementations, but was solved later with the "lazy I/O" concept.

In Jensen &amp; Wirth Pascal, strings are represented as packed arrays of chars; they therefore have fixed length and are usually space-padded.

===Pointer types===
Pascal supports the use of [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s:

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
type
  pNode = ^Node;
  Node  = record
          a : integer;
          b : char;
          c : pNode  {extra semicolon not strictly required}
          end;
var
  NodePtr : pNode;
  IntPtr  : ^integer;
&lt;/source&gt;

Here the variable ''NodePtr'' is a pointer to the data type ''Node'', a record. Pointers can be used before they are declared. This is a [[forward declaration]], an exception to the rule that things must be declared before they are used.

To create a new record and assign the value ''10'' and character ''A'' to the fields ''a'' and ''b'' in the record, and to initialise the pointer ''c'' to the [[null pointer]] ("NIL" in Pascal), the statements would be:

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
New(NodePtr);
...
NodePtr^.a := 10;
NodePtr^.b := 'A';
NodePtr^.c := NIL;
...
&lt;/source&gt;

This could also be done using the '''with''' statement, as follows:

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
New(NodePtr);
...
with NodePtr^ do
begin
  a := 10;
  b := 'A';
  c := NIL
end;
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Inside of the scope of the ''with'' statement, a and b refer to the subfields of the record pointer ''NodePtr'' and not to the record Node or the pointer type pNode.

[[Linked list]]s, [[Stack (abstract data type)|stacks]] and [[Queue (abstract data type)|queues]] can be created by including a pointer type field (c) in the record.

Unlike many languages that feature pointers, Pascal only allows pointers to reference dynamically created variables that are anonymous, and does not allow them to reference standard static or local variables. Pointers also must have an associated type, and a pointer to one type is not compatible with a pointer to another type (e.g. a pointer to a char is not compatible with a pointer to an integer). This helps eliminate the type security issues inherent with other pointer implementations, particularly those used for [[PL/I]] or [[C (Programming Language)|C]]. It also removes some risks caused by [[dangling pointers]], but the ability to dynamically deallocate referenced space by using the ''dispose'' function (which has the same effect as the ''free'' library function found in [[C (Programming Language)|C]]) means that the risk of dangling pointers has not been entirely eliminated&lt;ref name="Hoare.Sneeringer.Welsh.1977"&gt;J. Welsh, W. J. Sneeringer, and C. A. R. Hoare, "Ambiguities and Insecurities in Pascal", ''Software Practice and Experience 7'', pp. 685–696 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; as it has in languages such as Java and C#, which provide [[garbage collection (computer science)|automatic garbage collection]] (but which do not entirely eliminate the related problem of [[memory leak]]s).

Some of these restrictions can be lifted in newer dialects.

===Control structures===
Pascal is a [[structured programming]] language, meaning that the flow of control is structured into standard [[Statement (programming)|statements]], usually without '[[goto (command)|goto]]' commands.

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
while a &lt;&gt; b do  WriteLn('Waiting');

if a &gt; b then WriteLn('Condition met')   {no semicolon allowed!}
           else WriteLn('Condition not met');

for i := 1 to 10 do  {no semicolon for single statements allowed!}
  WriteLn('Iteration: ', i);

repeat
  a := a + 1
until a = 10;

case i of
  0 : Write('zero');
  1 : Write('one');
  2 : Write('two');
  3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10: Write('?')
end;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Procedures and functions===
Pascal structures programs into procedures and functions.

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
program Printing;

var i : integer;

procedure Print(j : integer);
begin
  ...
end;

begin { main program }
  ...
  Print(i);
end.
&lt;/source&gt;
Procedures and functions can nest to any depth, and the 'program' construct is the logical outermost block.

By default, parameters are passed by value.  If 'var' precedes a parameter's name, it is passed by reference.

Each procedure or function can have its own declarations of goto labels, constants, types, variables, and other procedures and functions, which must all be in that order.
This ordering requirement was originally intended to allow efficient [[single-pass compilation]]. However, in some dialects (such as [[Embarcadero Delphi]]) the strict ordering requirement of declaration sections has been relaxed.

===Semicolons as statement separators===
Pascal adopted many language syntax features from the [[ALGOL]] language, including the use of a semicolon as a statement separator.  This is in contrast to other languages, such as [[PL/I]], [[C (programming language)|C]] etc. which use the semicolon as a statement terminator.  As illustrated in the above examples, no semicolon is needed before the '''&lt;tt&gt;end&lt;/tt&gt;''' keyword of a record type declaration, a block, or a ''case'' statement; before the '''&lt;tt&gt;until&lt;/tt&gt;''' keyword of a repeat statement; and before the '''&lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt;''' keyword of an ''if'' statement.

The presence of an extra semicolon was not permitted in early versions of Pascal.  However, the addition of [[ALGOL]]-like empty statements in the 1973 ''Revised Report'' and later changes to the language in ISO 7185:1983 now allow for optional semicolons in most of these cases.  A semicolon is still not permitted immediately before the ''&lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt;'' keyword in an ''if'' statement, because the &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; follows a single statement, not a statement sequence. In the case of nested ifs, a semicolon cannot be used to avoid the [[dangling else]] problem (where the inner if does not have an else, but the outer if does) by putatively terminating the nested if with a semicolon – this instead terminates both if clauses. Instead, an explicit &lt;code&gt;begin...end&lt;/code&gt; block must be used.&lt;ref&gt;''Pascal,'' Nell Dale and Chip Weems, "Dangling Else", [https://books.google.com/books?id=5x2k4vWwn1wC&amp;pg=PA160 p. 160–161] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318223956/https://books.google.com/books?id=5x2k4vWwn1wC&amp;pg=PA160 |date=2017-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programmers usually include these extra semicolons out of habit and to avoid changing the last line of a statement sequence when new code is appended.

==Resources==

===Compilers and interpreters===
Several Pascal compilers and interpreters are available for general use:

* [[Embarcadero Delphi|Delphi]] is Embarcadero's (formerly Borland/CodeGear) flagship [[rapid application development]] (RAD) product. It uses the Object Pascal language (termed 'Delphi' by Borland), descended from Pascal, to create applications for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], [[iOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The .NET support that existed from D8 through D2005, D2006 and D2007 has been terminated, and replaced by a new language (Prism, which is rebranded Oxygene, see below) that is not fully backward compatible. In recent years [[Unicode]] support and generics were added (D2009, D2010, Delphi XE).
* [[Free Pascal]] is a multi-platform compiler written in [[Object Pascal]] (and is [[self-hosting]]).  It is aimed at providing a convenient and powerful compiler, both able to compile legacy applications and to be the means of developing new ones. It is distributed under the [[GNU GPL]], while packages and runtime library come under a modified [[GNU Lesser General Public License|GNU LGPL]]. Apart from compatibility modes for [[Turbo Pascal]], Delphi and Mac Pascal, it also has its own procedural and object-oriented syntax modes with support for extended features such as [[Operator (programming)|operator]] overloading.  It supports many platforms and operating systems.  Current versions also feature an ISO mode.
* [[ModernPascal|Modern Pascal]] is a multi-platform interpreter and p-code compiler written in [[Free Pascal]].  It is aimed at providing alternative solutions for PHP and node.js, using either an ISO standard pascal dialect or a hybrid supporting JavaScript/C operators. From the CLI it is useful as a Free Pascal interpreter.
* [[Turbo51]] is a free Pascal compiler for the [[Intel 8051|8051 family]] of microcontrollers, with [[Turbo Pascal]]&amp;nbsp;7 syntax.
* [[Oxygene (programming language)|Oxygene]] (formerly known as ''Chrome'') is an Object Pascal compiler for the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] and [[Mono (software)|Mono]] platforms.  It was created and is sold by [http://www.remobjects.com/ RemObjects Software], and sold for a while by Embarcadero as the backend compiler of [[Delphi Prism|Prism]].
* [[Kylix (software)|Kylix]] was a descendant of [[Object Pascal|Delphi]], with support for the [[Linux]] operating system and an improved object library.  It is no longer supported.  Compiler and IDE are available now for non-commercial use.
* [[GNU Pascal]] Compiler (GPC) is the Pascal compiler of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC).  The compiler itself is written in C, the runtime library mostly in Pascal.  Distributed under the [[GNU General Public License]], it runs on many platforms and operating systems.  It supports the ANSI/ISO standard languages and has partial Turbo Pascal dialect support.  One of the more painful omissions is the absence of a 100% Turbo Pascal-compatible (short)string type.  Support for Borland Delphi and other language variations is quite limited. There is some support for Mac-pascal however.
* [[Virtual Pascal]] was created by Vitaly Miryanov in 1995 as a native OS/2 compiler compatible with Borland Pascal syntax.  Then, it had been commercially developed by fPrint, adding Win32 support, and in 2000 it became freeware.  Today it can compile for Win32, OS/2 and Linux, and is mostly compatible with Borland Pascal and Delphi.  Development was canceled on April 4, 2005.
* [http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/pascal/ P4 compiler], the basis for many subsequent Pascal-implemented-in-Pascal compilers. It implements a subset of full Pascal.
* [http://www.standardpascal.com/p5.html P5 compiler], is an ISO 7185 (full Pascal) adaption of P4.
* [http://smartmobilestudio.com Smart Mobile Studio] is a Pascal to HTML5/Javascript compiler
* [[Turbo Pascal]] was the dominant Pascal compiler for PCs during the 1980s and early 1990s, popular both because of its powerful extensions and extremely short compilation times. Turbo Pascal was compactly written and could compile, run, and debug all from memory without accessing disk.  Slow floppy disk drives were common for programmers at the time, further magnifying Turbo Pascal's speed advantage.  Currently, older versions of Turbo Pascal (up to 5.5) are available for free download from Borland's site.
* [http://www.moorecad.com/ippas/ IP Pascal] Implements the language "Pascaline" (named after [[Pascal's calculator]]), which is a highly extended Pascal compatible with original Pascal according to ISO 7185. It features modules with namespace control, including parallel tasking modules with semaphores, objects, dynamic arrays of any dimensions that are allocated at runtime, overloads, overrides, and many other extensions. IP Pascal has a built-in portability library that is custom tailored to the Pascal language. For example, a standard text output application from 1970's original Pascal can be recompiled to work in a window and even have graphical constructs added.
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101027073206/http://ts.fujitsu.com/products/bs2000/software/compiler/pascalxt.html Pascal-XT] was created by [[Siemens]] for their [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] operating systems [[BS2000]] and [[SINIX]].
* [[PocketStudio]] is a Pascal subset compiler and RAD tool for [[Palm OS]] and MC68xxx processors with some own extensions to assist interfacing with the Palm OS API. It resembles Delphi and Lazarus with a visual form designer, an object inspector and a [[source code editor]].

A very extensive list can be found on [http://pascaland.org Pascaland]. The site is in French, but it is basically a list with URLs to compilers; there is little barrier for non-Francophones. The site, [http://pascal-central.com Pascal Central], a Mac centric Pascal info and advocacy site with a rich collection of article archives, plus links to many compilers and tutorials, may also be of interest.

===IDEs===

==Standards==

===ISO/IEC 7185:1990 Pascal===
In 1983, the language was standardized, in the international standard IEC/ISO 7185,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ISO/IEC 7185:1990 Pascal|url=http://www.pascal-central.com/docs/iso7185.pdf|accessdate=16 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127044422/http://pascal-central.com/docs/iso7185.pdf|archivedate=27 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several local country specific standards, including the American ANSI/IEEE770X3.97-1983, and ISO 7185:1983. These two standards differed only in that the ISO standard included a "level 1" extension for conformant arrays (an array where the boundaries of the array are not known until run time), where ANSI did not allow for this extension to the original (Wirth version) language. In 1989, ISO 7185 was revised (ISO 7185:1990) to correct various errors and ambiguities found in the original document.

The ISO 7185 was stated to be a clarification of Wirth's 1974 language as detailed by the User Manual and Report [Jensen and Wirth], but was also notable for adding "Conformant Array Parameters" as a level 1 to the standard, level 0 being Pascal without conformant arrays. This addition was made at the request of [[C. A. R. Hoare]], and with the approval of Niklaus Wirth. The precipitating cause was that Hoare wanted to create a Pascal version of the [[NAG Numerical Libraries|(NAG) Numerical Algorithms Library]], which had originally been written in FORTRAN, and found that it was not possible to do so without an extension that would allow array parameters of varying size. Similar considerations motivated the inclusion in ISO 7185 of the facility to specify the parameter types of procedural and functional parameters.

Niklaus Wirth himself referred to the 1974 language as "the Standard", for example, to differentiate it from the machine specific features of the [[CDC 6000]] compiler. This language was documented in ''The Pascal Report'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wirth|first1=Niklaus|title=The Programming Language Pascal (Revised Report)|date=July 1973|publisher=ETH Zürich|url=http://www.standardpascal.com/The_Programming_Language_Pascal_1973.pdf|accessdate=16 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315180106/http://www.standardpascal.com/The_Programming_Language_Pascal_1973.pdf|archivedate=15 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second part of the "Pascal users manual and report".

On the large machines (mainframes and minicomputers) Pascal originated on, the standards were generally followed. On the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], they were not. On IBM&amp;nbsp;PCs, the Borland standards Turbo Pascal and Delphi have the greatest number of users. Thus, it is typically important to understand whether a particular implementation corresponds to the original Pascal language, or a Borland dialect of it.

The IBM&amp;nbsp;PC versions of the language began to differ with the advent of UCSD Pascal, an interpreted implementation that featured several extensions to the language, along with several omissions and changes. Many UCSD language features survive today, including in Borland's dialect.

===ISO/IEC 10206:1990 Extended Pascal===
{{Expand section|date=February 2018}}
In 1990, an extended Pascal standard was created as ISO/IEC 10206,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Extended Pascal: ISO/IEC 10206:1990|url=http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~wpc/reports/compilers/compilerindex/iso10206.ps|accessdate=16 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327025949/http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/%7Ewpc/reports/compilers/compilerindex/iso10206.ps|archivedate=27 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is identical in technical content&lt;ref name="ISO/ANSI identical"&gt;{{cite web|title=Language standards: Pascal, Extended Pascal, Fortan|url=http://www.prosperosoftware.com/std.html|accessdate=16 September 2014|ref=identical|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714024231/http://www.prosperosoftware.com/std.html|archive-date=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to IEEE/ANSI 770X3.160-1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=770X3.160-1989 - IEEE/ANSI Standard for the Programming Language Extended Pascal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.1990.101061|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- WHAT FOLLOW APPEARS FACTUALLY WRONG AND IS COMMENTED OUT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE
In 1993, the ANSI standard was replaced by the ANSI organization with a "pointer" to the ISO 7185:1990 standard, effectively ending its status as a different standard.
--&gt;

===Variations===
Niklaus Wirth's Zurich version of Pascal was issued outside [[ETH Zurich|ETH]] in two basic forms, the CDC 6000 compiler source, and a porting kit called Pascal-P system. The Pascal-P compiler left out several features of the full language. For example, procedures and functions used as parameters, undiscriminated variant records, packing, dispose, interprocedural gotos and other features of the full compiler were omitted.

[[UCSD Pascal]], under Professor [[Kenneth Bowles]], was based on the Pascal-P2 kit, and consequently shared several of the Pascal-P language restrictions. UCSD Pascal was later adopted as Apple Pascal, and continued through several versions there. Although UCSD Pascal actually expanded the subset Pascal in the Pascal-P kit by adding back standard Pascal constructs, it was still not a complete standard installation of Pascal.

In the early 1990s, [[Alan Burns (professor)|Alan Burns]] and [[Geoff Davies (computer scientist)|Geoff Davies]] developed Pascal-FC, an extension to Pl/0 (from the Niklaus' book 'Algorithms+Data Structures=Programs'). Several constructs were added to use Pascal-FC as a teaching tool for Concurrent Programming (such as semaphores, monitors, channels, remote-invocation and resources). To be able to demonstrate concurrency, the compiler output (a kind of [[p-code machine|P-code]]) could then be executed on a virtual machine. This virtual machine not only simulated a normal – fair – environment, but could also simulate extreme conditions (unfair mode).

====Borland-like Pascal compilers====
[[Borland]]'s [[Turbo Pascal]], written by [[Anders Hejlsberg]], was written in assembly language independent of UCSD or the Zurich compilers. However, it adopted much of the same subset and extensions as the UCSD compiler. This is probably because the UCSD system was the most common Pascal system suitable for developing applications on the resource-limited microprocessor systems available at that time.

The [[shrink-wrapped]] Turbo Pascal version 3 and later incarnations, including Borland's [[Object Pascal]] and [[Delphi (programming language)|Delphi]] and non-Borland near-compatibles became popular with programmers including shareware authors, and so the SWAG library of Pascal code features a large amount of code written with such versions as Delphi in mind.

Software products ([[compiler]]s, and IDE/[[Rapid Application Development]] (RAD) in this category:
* [[Turbo Pascal]] - "TURBO.EXE" up to version 7, and Turbo Pascal for Windows ("TPW") and [[Turbo Pascal#Apple Macintosh|Turbo Pascal for Macintosh]].
* [[Turbo Pascal#Windows versions|Borland Pascal 7]] (essentially Turbo Pascal 7 for Windows).
* [[Object Pascal]] - an extension of the Pascal language that was developed at [[Apple Computer]] by a team led by [[Larry Tesler]] in consultation with [[Niklaus Wirth]], the inventor of Pascal; its features were added to Borland's [[Turbo Pascal#Apple Macintosh|Turbo Pascal for Macintosh]] and in 1989 for Turbo Pascal 5.5 for DOS.
* [[Delphi (programming language)|Delphi]] - Object Pascal is essentially its underlying language.
* [[Free Pascal]] compiler (FPC) - Free Pascal adopted the de facto standard dialect of Pascal programmers, Borland Pascal and, later, Delphi.
* [[PascalABC.NET]] - is a new generation Pascal programming language including compiler and IDE

==Reception==
Pascal generated a wide variety of responses in the computing community, both critical and complimentary.

===Early criticism===
While very popular in the 1980s and early 1990s, implementations of Pascal that closely followed Wirth's initial definition of the language were widely criticized for being unsuitable for use outside teaching. [[Brian Kernighan]], who popularized the [[C (programming language)|C language]], outlined his most notable criticisms of Pascal as early as 1981, in his paper ''Why Pascal Is Not My Favorite Programming Language''.&lt;ref&gt;Brian W. Kernighan (1981). [http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428163341/https://www.princeton.edu/~mike/unixhistory |date=2009-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most serious problem described in his article was that array sizes and string lengths were part of the type, so it was not possible to write a function that would accept variable length arrays or even strings as parameters. This made it unfeasible to write, for example, a sorting library. Kernighan also criticized the unpredictable order of evaluation of boolean expressions, poor library support, and lack of [[static variable]]s, and raised a number of smaller issues. Also, he stated that the language did not provide any simple constructs to "escape" (knowingly and forcibly ignore) restrictions and limitations.  More general complaints from other sources&lt;ref name="Hoare.Sneeringer.Welsh.1977"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Lecarme, P. Desjardins, "More Comments on the Programming Language Pascal," ''Acta Informatica 4'', pp. 231–243 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; noted that the scope of declarations was not clearly defined in the original language definition, which sometimes had serious consequences when using [[forward declaration]]s to define pointer types, or when record declarations led to [[Recursive data type|mutual recursion]], or when an identifier may or may not have been used in an enumeration list. Another difficulty was that, like [[ALGOL 60]], the language did not allow procedures or functions passed as parameters to predefine the expected type of their parameters.

Most of Kernighan's criticisms were directly addressed in the paper "The Pascal Programming Language",&lt;ref&gt;[http://pascal-central.com/ppl/index.html The Pascal Programming Language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228010208/http://www.pascal-central.com/ppl/index.html |date=2008-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically, under Myth 6: Pascal is Not For Serious Programmers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pascal-central.com/ppl/chapter4.html#Myths Pascal Myths] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917235816/http://pascal-central.com/ppl/chapter4.html |date=2015-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite initial criticisms, Pascal continued to evolve, and most of Kernighan's points do not apply to versions of the language which were enhanced to be suitable for commercial product development, such as Borland's [[Turbo Pascal]].  As Kernighan predicted in his article, most of the extensions to fix these issues were incompatible from compiler to compiler.  Since the early 1990s, however, most of the varieties seem condensed into two categories, ISO and Borland-like.

Extended Pascal addresses many of these early criticisms.  It supports variable-length strings, variable initialization, separate compilation, short-circuit boolean operators, and default (OTHERWISE) clauses for case statements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pascal-central.com/ppl/chapter3.html#Extended Extended Pascal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018023934/http://www.pascal-central.com/ppl/chapter3.html |date=2015-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''pedagogical relation''' refers to special kind of [[personal relationship]] between [[adult]] and [[child]] or adult or [[student]] that is different from other personal relationships. The pedagogical relation is described by Hermann Nohl, [[Klaus Mollenhauer]], and others in the Northern European [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Science_Pedagogy|human science pedagogical tradition]]. It has been discussed more recently in English by [[Max van Manen]], [[Norm Friesen]], Tone Saevi and Tatiana Shchyttsova.

The pedagogical relation is marked by a number of characteristics:
*In the pedagogical relation the adult is directed toward the child. The relation is asymmetrical, unlike many other personal relationships (e.g. [[friendship]]). The adult is "there" for the child in a way that the child is not "there" for the adult.
*In the pedagogical relation the adult wants or intends both what is good for the child in the present and in the future. This relationship is oriented to what the child may become (without trying to predetermine it), but without ignoring what is important for the child in the present. These two, present needs and the likely requirements of the future, exist in constant tension this the pedagogical relation.
*The pedagogical relation comes to an end. The child grows up and the asymmetry of the relation (if it is still maintained) dissolves. As Klaus Mollenhauer explains, "upbringing comes to an end when the child no longer needs to be "called" to self-activity, but instead has the wherewithal to educate himself."
*In the pedagogical relation the adult is ''tactful''. As Max van Manen and Jakob Muth explain, tact in this context often consists of holding back and waiting or maintaining a certain distance so that the child may act for him- or herself.

[[File:PhD Comics Open Access Week 2012.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=7:58|A PhD Comics special on the occasion of [[Open Access Week]] 2012.]]
'''''Piled Higher and Deeper''''' (also known as '''''PhD Comics'''''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/education/edlife/edl-24phd-t.html?_r=1|title=The Joke Is on the Ph.D.|last=CHOE|first=JAYWON|date=22 July 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a newspaper and [[webcomic]] strip written and drawn by [[Jorge Cham]] that follows the lives of several [[grad student]]s.  First published in the fall of 1997 when Cham was a grad student himself at [[Stanford University]], the strip deals with issues of life in [[graduate school]], including the difficulties of scientific research, the perils of [[procrastination]], the complex student–supervisor relationship and the perpetual search for free food. Cham continued the strip as an Instructor in [[mechanical engineering]] at [[Caltech]], and now draws and gives talks about the strip full-time. Originally, the strip was drawn in crude black-and-white, eventually became grayscale, and finally became color in June 2004.

==Characters==
''Piled Higher and Deeper'' introduced its main characters early in its run, and their personalities have remained fairly constant during the strip's several years of publication. In the strip's first few seasons, the characters were clearly [[Stanford University]] students, though the number of school-specific references and jokes has decreased since.

===Students===
&lt;!--Please arrange alphabetically by last name, or by first name if the last name is unknown.--&gt;

* '''The Nameless Grad Student (a.k.a., The Nameless Hero)''' – a graduate student in engineering, this bespectacled protagonist has procrastinated through the entire strip without receiving a name. He bears a striking resemblance to the comic strip author, [[Jorge Cham]] (at one point, his younger sister Dee remarks that her brother has dreams of quitting grad school and becoming a [[cartoonist]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Lil' sister|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=253|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=September 21, 2001|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about the hero's background, although early on Mike Slackenerny states that he knew the hero's older brother (who quit his PhD and went on to work for a "[[Silicon Valley]] Company").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Mike Slackenerny: A PhD student needs not such things|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=40|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=February 11, 1998|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he is seen playing with two children at home during his winter vacation,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Taking the laptop with me|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=802|date=December 20, 2006|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; {{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Scooped!: The Third ''Piled Higher &amp; Deeper'' Comic Strip Collection|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|publisher=Piled Higher &amp; Deeper, LLC|year=2008|isbn=978-0-9721695-3-0|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; he probably has younger siblings, nieces and/or nephews, or cousins. He has been increasingly seen with a set group of friends (one is named '''Mikkel''')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Dead Week|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=21|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 22, 1997|accessdate=April 23, 2009}})&lt;/ref&gt; and seems, at least marginally, to be the most favored graduate student of his advisor, Prof. Smith. At the conclusion of the film, the character states for the first time that his name is '''Winston''', named after Jorge's father; in the films, Winston is a Biochemistry grad student.
* '''Cecilia''' – An engineering student born around May 1, 1980&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia turned 25 in 2005: {{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Birthday 2005|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=583|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=May |accessdate=October 28, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier strips have her born in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia went to her 10 year high school reunion in 2001: {{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=High School Reunion|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=268|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 14, 2001|accessdate=October 28, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Cecilia spent years refusing to admit that she was truly a [[geek]] at heart. However, in one strip&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=25 |title=Geeks Anonymous |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; she finally with hesitation admitted she is indeed a geek. She is also a programmer as well. Addicted to chocolate and cookies, she has long since taken enough classes and conducted enough research to graduate, but a mysterious psychological force keeps her in school. She stated in an interview for a project by her friend Tajel that her father was a professor, a "great teacher",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=The grad student of academia|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=209|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 23, 2000|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; something that may or may not be a motivation for her to go above and beyond (also, her choice of words indicates that her father may have died). During class, she deliberately wears frumpy clothes to discourage male interest, since the vast majority of her classmates are men. This strategy is not always successful – "Excuse me, female, will you marry me?"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Dress to repress|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=591|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=June 6, 2005|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; She has had two boyfriends in the course of the strip: David and Scott. Although she broke up with David relatively quickly, she seriously dated '''Scott''', her crush in high school, for numerous strips;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Friday night|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=710|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=May 8, 2006|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; they had a [[long-distance relationship]] for a while after Scott was promoted and moved to London&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Long distance|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=714|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=May 18, 2006|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; but broke up amicably in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Is this it?|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=843|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=March 30, 2007|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Cecilia sometimes accompanies Tajel to political rallies and such events. She was asked in 2006 by a professor to interview for a faculty position at a different institution because "it's the only position you're not overqualified for"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Faculty position|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=679|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=January 31, 2006|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; and "we hired one of their grad students, so, diplomatically, they owe us."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Faculty position|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=680|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=February 5, 2006|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Michael Slackenerny''' – endlessly devious, remarkably clever and phenomenally lazy, Mike did his undergraduate at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Go Cardinal!|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=151|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 11, 1999|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet had been in graduate school for longer than anyone can remember (during one of his interviews it was strongly implied that he started grad school in the 1980s), surviving on ''[[ramen]]'' and free food from various events on campus. He views grad school not as a place but as "a state of mind [...] preferably sleeping".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Coming back to grad school|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=394|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=December 8, 2003|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1998, he drove to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] with a seemingly foolproof plan to beat the [[blackjack]] tables, thereby winning enough money to solve Stanford's housing crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Slackenerny – going to Vegas|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=72|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=May 22, 1998|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he returned with a wife, '''Jen''', who remained an [[unseen character]] for some time. Jen became pregnant with their daughter '''Sophy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Paternity leave|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=676|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=January 23, 2006|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; and stayed that way for several years, constantly urging Michael to finish his thesis and graduate. Michael finally completed his doctoral defense in 2005 – Jen went into labor just before his presentation began – but did not finish writing his thesis until 2007. After submitting his dissertation, Mike was seen walking home and asking himself, "Now what?"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Now what?|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=844|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=April 2, 2007|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of job-hunting, he was finally hired by Prof. Smith as a [[postdoc]].
* '''Tajel''' – an [[anthropologist]] and the lone social scientist in the main cast. She was Cecilia's roommate before she got married. She is a dedicated [[activism|activist]] who frequently attends or organizes rallies. Her frustration with U.S. politics is exacerbated by her not being a United States citizen. She is conversant in Spanish. Her mother is Indian and her father is Caucasian. She married Dr. Khumalo in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1118 |title=Drama! |publisher=PHD Comics }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1135 |title=Tajel got married |publisher=PHD Comics }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gerard''' – the strip's newest "official" character, he is a major in Medieval [[Scandinavia]]n Cultural Philosophy, who was personally introduced to readers by Tajel, supposedly in response to numerous letters from Humanities majors requesting their own character, and was meant to provide jokes on "obscure manuscripts, dead languages, and being the lowest paid grads on campus. Also, political correctness!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=907 |title=Humanities |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Gerard has only been shown twice after his initial introduction, apart from a cameo as a guest at Tajel's wedding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1134 |title=Tajel getting married, pt. 5 |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in a joke on the obscurity and uselessness of his field.  His first actual storyline within the comic occurs when he is informed that funding has been cut for humanities majors and to leave the strip or find a more useful major, subsequently forcing him to justify why the comic should retain a humanities character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1170 |title=Budget cuts |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dee''' – the hero's younger sister.  She is an [[undergraduate student]] who has been seen taking the [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]]. She also talks on her [[cellular telephone]], eats quite a bit, and naps during class when she isn't doing something even more inappropriate, such as chatting or eating a full meal during a test. Dee once phones her "sister dearest", so the main character may have more than one sibling. Dee has a good male friend who she often spends time with and at one point hints that he may have romantic feelings for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=371 |title=Choosing grad schools |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the main character, he has not yet been named.
* '''Mariko''' – a [[Japan]]ese student in the same research field as the hero, she visits Prof. Smith's lab in 1998. Smith assigns her to work with "whoever is lowest in the lab hierarchy", which turns out to be the hero. During her brief stay, she inspires in him a powerful [[unrequited love|unrequited affection]], which he maintains for at least three years. She eventually quits her [[Ph.D.]] and starts her own company, at which the hero works briefly. She is still occasionally seen talking with the main character as he works, so her current status is somewhat murky.  On a strip dated 28 April 2010, entitled "Lost no more..?", she was seen in an alternate timeline as possibly being the mother of the Nameless Hero's (supposed) baby, with the Nameless Hero asking "WHAT IF I HAD STAYED IN ACADEMIA?"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=PHD Comics: Lost no more...?|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1310|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Steve''' (''aka. Golden Boy'') – Remarkably clever, sincere and "good boy". Steve has been in graduate school for two years and has already completed his thesis. In the lab hierarchy he is given more consideration than any of the post docs or research associates by Prof. Smith. He is extremely good in getting positive results and is always consulted by Prof. Smith for his opinion. His "good boy" image in comparison to the nameless hero is a running joke in the series.
* '''Allison''' – The sole female PhD student in Professor Smith's lab, which Smith and the other PhDs often forget to Allison's frustration.  Unlike her labmates, she is not distracted by sporting events like the World Cup and proves to have some measure of athletic ability during the students vs. professors baseball match.

* '''Professor Jones''' – Cecilia's research advisor; a typical graduate school professor, although seemingly older and kinder than Prof. Smith. He is clueless in giving Cecilia advice on non-research related topics such as her lovelife and future career and will ask for her help with small tasks, such as changing the font size of footnotes, while claiming it is urgent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1104 |title=Tech support |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently the only reason he has time to see his wife is because he married his administrative assistant;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Bridge|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=880|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=June 29, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  before he received tenure, he had already been divorced three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=875 |title=Simpler |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a daughter in 1st grade named Shelley,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Cingradella|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=601|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=July 4, 2005|accessdate=April 23, 2009}}; Cham, ''Scooped!'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; who is intelligent enough to fix Mike's work for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=Kids!

* '''Dr. Patrick Khumalo''' –  An adjunct professor&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1811  The Dictionary Definition of Adjunct]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Anthropology Department's faculty, who Tajel eventually marries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1124 |title=Permission |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1135 |title=Tajel got married |publisher=PHD Comics }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tajel mistakes him for a first-year grad student when they first meet, possibly because she is older than he is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=460 |title=Social |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Professor Rivera''' – Tajel's advisor. He apparently takes a laid-back approach to being an advisor, being entirely clueless as to Tajel's research interests, progress, and sometimes even her name. Once he praised a draft of a paper that Tajel had written, three months after Tajel had already submitted the final paper on due date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=855 | work=Pile Higher and Deeper | last=Cham | first=Jorge | title=Terrific Job | date=27 April 2007 | accessdate=19 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, he is extremely elusive when needed, such as when Cecilia needed to find him for documents to allow Tajel to renew her visa, appearing only when Cecilia tried imagining he was the last person she wanted to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1045 |title=Only when you don't need them |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is married to Professor Stein, the chair of the anthropology department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1127 |title=A very serious matter |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite being aware that he lacks any apparent interest in Tajel's work, she is still stunned when he leaves for a position at another university&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1706  It's Official]&lt;/ref&gt; with only an offer of advising her remotely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1708  Remote Advisor]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Professor Galvez''' &amp;ndash; The head of the anthropology department,&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1847  Adoption]&lt;/ref&gt; who becomes Tajel's new advisor after discussion with the rest of the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1848 Close match]&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to Rivera, Galvez apparently has a surly personality&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1897  Gotta Catch Them All]&lt;/ref&gt; and finds Tajel's emails to be too lengthy to bother reading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1876  TL;DR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Smith regretted it for the rest of his life, consoling himself many years later by saying to himself, "who cares, I've got tenure".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=A Smithmas Carol|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=665|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 24, 2010|accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second PhD Movie elaborates on this further, showing Sangeeta's fate after young Brian stupidly missed the opportunity of a lifetime with her: decades later, Sangeeta is a professor herself and one of Prof. Smith's leading rivals in his field. But even then, it is clear that Prof. Smith never got over her. When she encounters him at a scientific conference, taunting his work, he has no wits to reply and can only stare longingly at her, until she finally snaps him out of his trance. It is unclear whether she still harbors a buried affection for him in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Jorge Cham|title=The PhD Movie 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2y_a7hL5M|publisher=Piled Higher and Deeper|date=November 24, 2010|accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Smith's current wife presumably hopes not. Prof. Smith was originally drawn so that his face was never seen, much like [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] in the early [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] movies, [[Doctor Claw]] in ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'', or any teacher/adult in ''[[Peanuts]]''.

==Parodies==
[[Image:Jorge Chum at UIUC by Ragib.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jorge Cham]] after his "Power of Procrastination" talk at [[UIUC]], March 8, 2007]]

The title of the comic comes from an old joke about becoming a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], which explains that if one knows what "[[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]]" stands for (in this context, "bullshit"), then "[[Master of Science|M.S.]]" stands for "More of the Same" (or "More Shit"), and "Ph.D." stands for "Piled Higher and Deeper".

One of Cham's recurring themes is to re-cast an item of [[popular culture]] in the grad-school milieu. Upon several occasions, the strip has included spoofs of popular movies, like ''The Thesis'' (''[[The Matrix]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=138 |title=What is... The Thesis? |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Raiders of the Lost Dissertation'' (''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=158 |title=Raiders of the lost dissertation |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''I, Grad Student'' (a mixture of the [[I, Robot|book]] and [[I, Robot (movie)|movie]] ''I, Robot''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=440 |title=I, Grad Student |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Summer days'' ([[Summer Nights (Grease song)|"Summer Nights"]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=887 |title=Summer Days |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In addition, Cham has parodied [[television]] programs like ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]],'' among others.

Jorge Cham has also parodied [[Newton's laws of motion]] as ''Newton's 3 Laws of Graduation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=221 |title=Newton`s Three Laws of Graduation |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the strip these laws of graduation were superseded by Einstein's ''Special Theory of Research Inactivity'', much as Newton's actual laws were superseded by Einstein's [[Special Theory of Relativity]].

Another series of strips takes up the modern debate about the proper use of the term "[[irony]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=200 |title=Irony? |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strip has also included several adaptations of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] as well as several [[propaganda]] posters. Captions for the latter include "This man does research for ''you!''", "When you procrastinate... Someone is watching!" and "Women in grad school... Support your local female geek."

Cham has also released two song parodies, purportedly sung by Tajel, in [[MP3]] format: "Closer to fine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=191 |title=Closer to Fine (Academic Version) |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. [[Indigo Girls#Singles|Indigo Girls]]) and "Who will grade your work"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=194 |title=Who will grade your work? |publisher=PHD Comics |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''[[Who Will Save Your Soul]]'').

==Books==

Five PhD comic books have been published so far. The first book, ''Piled Higher and Deeper: A Graduate Comic Strip Collection'' (2002), contains production sketches and an [[afterword]] by Prof. Smith in addition to the comic strips.

The second volume, ''Life is Tough and then You Graduate'', was published in April 2005. It contains six strips not published online that explain what happened in Mike's [[thesis defense]]. It also has a foreword by [[Karl Marx]], behind-the-scenes author notes and a [[graduate school]] [[board game]].

The third book, ''Scooped!'', which was released in May 2007, also contains "Tales from the Road", a series of comics that detail Cham's experiences whilst giving his Power of Procrastination tour.

The fourth book, ''Academic Stimulus Package'', was released March 2009. This volume is printed in full color.

The fifth book, ''Adventures in Thesisland'', was released April 2012. This volume is also printed in full color. The introduction is an excerpt from the screenplay of the PHD Movie.

==''Piled Higher and Deeper: the Movie''==
In March 2011, Jorge Cham started filming a movie based on the comic series.  The film production is a collaboration between Cham and a theater group at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. In fall 2011, the film was released on selected academic campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/A-Comic-Strip-That-Skewers/126921/ |title=A Comic Strip That Skewers Academe Will Become a Live-Action Movie |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date= |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trailer of the movie is available on the Piled Higher and Deeper website as of June 8, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1433&lt;/ref&gt; After about a year of various campus screenings around the world, the movie became available for purchase on DVD or streaming on April 15, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phdmovie.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The sequel to the movie was shot in the Caltech campus and was released later in 2015. For the first time in India, it was screened in [[IIT Madras]] on 8 April 2016 as part of their [[Research Scholars Day-2016]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rsdiitm.com/?page_id=821{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RHnet''' is the [[Iceland]]ic [[NREN|Educational and Research Network]]. Its objective is to link together Icelandic universities and research institutions by means of a high capacity computer network, and supply services in the field of computer communications, both domestically and internationally.

RHnet is a limited company, founded with the sole aim of enhancing the level of communication within the Icelandic university and research community, and serve as its gateway to international networks.

RHnet is based on the principle of exclusive service to the institutions linked to it. Thus RHnet is only open to acknowledged Icelandic institutions of research and higher learning. No distinction is made between basic and applied science provided that the institute in question enjoys official recognition.

== History ==
The Icelandic University Research Network (RHnet) was formally established on January 24, 2001.

The founders of RHnet are: [[The University of Iceland]], Iceland University of Education, [[University of Akureyri|The University of Akureyri]], [[Reykjavík University]], [[Iceland Academy of the Arts]], [[Agricultural University of Iceland]], [[Bifröst School of Business]], [[Hólar University College]], The State Horticultural School, The National University Hospital, The Nordic Volcanological Institute, The Icelandic Technological Institute, The Construction Research Institute, The Agricultural Research Institute, National Energy Authority, Marine Research Institute and The Icelandic Fisheries Laboratories.

'''Shareable Content Object Reference Model''' ('''SCORM''') is a collection of standards and specifications for web-based electronic [[educational technology]] (also called e-learning). It defines communications between client side content and a host system (called "the run-time environment"), which is commonly supported by a [[learning management system]]. SCORM also defines how content may be packaged into a transferable [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] file called "Package Interchange Format."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adlnet.gov/public/uploads/SCORM_2004_4ED_v1_1_Doc_Suite.zip|title=Technical Specification (4th Ed.)|publisher=SCORM |date= |accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCORM is a specification of the [[Advanced Distributed Learning]] (ADL) Initiative from the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense|Office of the United States Secretary of Defense]].

SCORM 2004 introduced a complex idea called sequencing, which is a set of rules that specifies the order in which a learner may experience content objects. In simple terms, they constrain a learner to a fixed set of paths through the training material, permit the learner to "bookmark" their progress when taking breaks, and assure the acceptability of test scores achieved by the learner.  The standard uses [[XML]], and it is based on the results of work done by [[Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee|AICC]], IMS Global, [[IEEE]], and [[Ariadne (software)|Ariadne]].

== Technology ==
SCORM was designed to be web-based and utilizes JavaScript to facilitate communication between the client side content and the run-time environment. Each SCORM version specifies the methods that the run-time environment should support and how those methods should behave. Content launched by the run time environment can then call those methods utilizing JavaScript.

== Versions ==
=== SCORM 1.1 ===
SCORM 1.1 is the first production version. It used a Course Structure Format XML file based on the [[Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee|AICC]] specifications to describe content structure, but lacked a robust packaging manifest and support for metadata. Quickly abandoned in favor of SCORM 1.2.

=== SCORM 1.2 ===
This was the first version that was widely used. It is still widely used and is supported by most Learning Management Systems.

=== SCORM 2004 ===
This is the current version. It is based on new standards for API and content object-to-runtime environment communication, with many ambiguities of previous versions resolved. Includes ability to specify adaptive sequencing of activities that use the content objects. Includes ability to share and use information about the success status for multiple learning objectives or competencies across content objects and across courses for the same learner within the same learning management system. A more robust test suite helps ensure good interoperability.

==== SCORM 2004 editions ====

*3rd Edition (October 2005) – clarification of various conformance requirements and of the interaction between content objects and the runtime environment for sequencing; some new conformance requirements to improve interoperability.
*4th Edition Released (March 31, 2009) – more stringent interoperability requirements, more flexible data persistence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCORM 2004 4th Edition Version 1.1 Overview|url=http://adlnet.gov/adl-research/scorm/scorm-2004-4th-edition/|website=SCORM 2004 4th Edition Version 1.1 Overview|accessdate=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== SCORM 2004 specification books ====

=== Experience API (Tin Can API) ===
The [[Experience API]] (also known as xAPI or Tin Can API) was finalized to version 1.0 in April 2013. The Experience API solves many of the problems inherent with older versions of SCORM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCORM – Project Tin Can: Phase 3 – Capabilities|url=http://scorm.com/tincancapabilities/|work=SCORM – Project Tin Can: Phase 3 – Capabilities|publisher=Rustici Software|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Just like SCORM, ADL is the steward of the Experience API. [[Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee|AICC]] with their cmi5 planned to use [[Experience API|xAPI]] as their transport standard, but AICC membership decided to dissolve the organization and transferred cmi5 to ADL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aicc.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111025107/http://aicc.org/ |archivedate=2007-11-11 |df= }} AICC dissolves, transfers cmi5 to ADL&lt;/ref&gt;

The Experience API (Tin Can API) is a  web service that allows software clients to read and write experiential data in the form of “statement” objects. In their simplest form, statements are in the form of “I did this”, or more generally “actor verb object”. More complex statement forms can be used. There is also a built-in query API to help filter recorded statements, and a state API that allows for a sort of “scratch space” for consuming applications. Experience API statements are stored in a [[data store]] called a [[Learning Record Store]], which can exist on its own or within a [[Learning Management System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tech Overview - Tin Can API|url=http://tincanapi.com/developers/tech-overview/|work=Tech Overview - Tin Can API|publisher=Rustici Software|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shelter Island Conference on Quantum Mechanics in Valence Theory''' was held in 1951. It was also sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences. 

The Nobel Laureate [[Robert S. Mulliken]] organized the meeting. The other participants were Theodore H. Berlin, [[Bryce L. Crawford]], [[Charles A. Coulson]], [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Henry Eyring]], [[Joseph Hirschfelder]], [[George E. Kimball]], Masao Kotani, [[Sir John Lennard-Jones]], Per-Olov Lowdin, D. A.

'''Special education''' (also known as '''special needs education''', '''aided education''', '''exceptional education''' or '''Special Ed''') is the practice of educating students in a way that addresses their [[individual differences]] and needs. Ideally, this process involves the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching procedures, adapted equipment and materials, and accessible settings. These interventions are designed to help individuals with special needs achieve a higher level of personal self-sufficiency and success in school and in their community which may not be available if the student were only given access to a typical classroom education.

Common special needs include [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] (such as [[dyslexia]]), [[communication disorder]]s, [[emotional and behavioral disorders]] (such as [[ADHD]]), [[physical disabilities]] (such as [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[muscular dystrophy]], [[spina bifida]], and [[Friedreich's ataxia]]), and [[developmental disabilities]] (such as [[autism spectrum disorders]] and [[intellectual disability]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minedu.govt.nz/educationSectors/SpecialEducation/AboutSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation.aspx What is special education?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512043236/http://www.minedu.govt.nz/educationSectors/SpecialEducation/AboutSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation.aspx |date=12 May 2009 }} from New Zealand's Ministry of Education&lt;/ref&gt; Students with these kinds of special needs are likely to benefit from additional educational services such as different approaches to teaching, the use of technology, a specifically adapted teaching area, or a [[resource room]].

[[Intellectual giftedness]] is a difference in learning and can also benefit from specialised teaching techniques or different educational programs, but the term "special education" is generally used to specifically indicate instruction of students with disabilities. [[Gifted education]] is handled separately.

Whereas special education is designed specifically for students with special needs, [[remedial education]] can be designed for any students, with or without special needs; the defining trait is simply that they have reached a point of unpreparedness, regardless of why. For example, even people of high [[intelligence]] can be under-prepared if their education was disrupted, for example, by [[internally displaced person|internal displacement]] during [[civil disorder]] or a [[war]].

In most developed countries, educators modify teaching methods and environments so that the maximum number of students are served in general education environments. Therefore, special education in developed countries is often regarded as a service rather than a place.&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Disability. (1994).

The opposite of special education is ''general education''. General education is the standard [[curriculum]] presented without special teaching methods or supports. Students receiving special education services can enroll in a General education setting to learn along with students without disabilities.

==Identifying students or learners with special needs==
[[File:Skolegutt.jpg|alt=A boy wearing a jacket and a backpack|thumb|A six-year-old boy with [[Down syndrome]] is ready for his first day of school.]]
Some children are easily identified as candidates for special needs due to their medical history. They may have been diagnosed with a genetic condition that is associated with [[intellectual disability]], may have various forms of [[brain damage]], may have a [[developmental disorder]], may have visual or hearing disabilities, or other disabilities.

For students with less obvious disabilities, such as those who have learning difficulties, two primary methods have been used for identifying them: the ''discrepancy model'' and the ''response to intervention model''. The discrepancy model depends on the teacher noticing that the students' achievements are noticeably below what is expected. At which the teacher may make the decision for the student to receive support from a special education specialist. Before doing so, the teacher must show documentation of low academic achievement. The [[response to intervention]] model advocates earlier intervention.

In the discrepancy model, a student receives special education services for a specific learning difficulty (SLD) if the student has at least normal intelligence and the student's academic achievement is below what is expected of a student with his or her [[IQ]]. Although the discrepancy model has dominated the school system for many years, there has been substantial criticism of this approach (e.g., Aaron, 1995, Flanagan and Mascolo, 2005) among researchers. One reason for criticism is that diagnosing SLDs on the basis of the discrepancy between achievement and IQ does not predict the effectiveness of treatment. Low academic achievers who also have low IQ appear to benefit from treatment just as much as low academic achievers who have normal or high intelligence.

The alternative approach, [[response to intervention]], identifies children who are having difficulties in school in their first or second year after starting school. They then receive additional assistance such as participating in a [[Reading for special needs|reading remediation]] program. The response of the children to this intervention then determines whether they are designated as having a learning disability. Those few who still have trouble may then receive designation and further assistance. Sternberg (1999) has argued that early remediation can greatly reduce the number of children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities. He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the provision of accommodations in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses and places undue emphasis on academics by insisting that students should be supported in this arena and not in music or sports.

==Individual needs==
A special education program should be customised to address each individual student's unique needs. Special educators provide a continuum of services, in which students with special needs receives varying degrees of support based on their individual needs. Special education programs need to be individualised so that they address the unique combination of needs in a given student.&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodman, Libby |title=Time and learning in the special education classroom |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y. |year=1990 |page= 122 |isbn=0-7914-0371-8 |oclc=20635959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Canada, and the UK, educational professionals use a student's [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP). Another name for a student's Individualized Education Plan is a student's [[Individual Learning Plan]] (ILP).

"The IEP is meant to address each child’s unique learning issues and include specific educational goals. It is a legally binding document. The school must provide everything it promises in the IEP."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/special-services/ieps/understanding-individualized-education-programs|title=Understanding Individualized Education Programs|website=Understood.org|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For children who are not yet 3, an [[Individual Family Service Plan]] (IFSP) contains information on the child's present level of development in all areas; outcomes for the child and family; and services the child and family will receive to help them achieve the outcomes.

In the United States, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) is a federal law that requires that every school system in the nation must provide a free and appropriate public education for every child, ages 3 to 22, regardless of how or how seriously that child may be disabled.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exceptional Learners|last=Hallahan |first=Daniel |publisher=Pearson Education|year=2012|isbn=978-0-13-703370-6|location=Boston|pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that this federal law is obeyed, the government requires every school system provide this type of education to each student in order to receive federal funding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Special Education Process.jpg|thumb|Procedure that a person must follow in order to receive special education accommodations]]
Students with special needs are assessed to determine their specific strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref name=Goodman /&gt; The earlier these students with special needs are assessed, the better it is for them to get the accommodations that they need in order for them to get the most out of their education. Placement, resources, and goals are determined on the basis of the student's needs. Accommodations and Modifications to the regular program may include changes in the curriculum, supplementary aides or equipment, and the provision of specialized physical adaptations that allow students to participate in the educational environment as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weac.org/Issues_Advocacy/Resource_Pages_On_Issues_one/Special_Education/special_education_inclusion.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107145830/http://www.weac.org/Issues_Advocacy/Resource_Pages_On_Issues_One/Special_Education/special_education_inclusion.aspx |archivedate=7 January 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students may need this help to access subject matter, physically gain access to the school, or meet their emotional needs. For example, if the assessment determines that the student cannot write by hand because of a physical disability, then the school might provide a computer for typing assignments, or allow the student to answer questions verbally instead. If the school determines that the student is severely distracted by the normal activities in a large, busy classroom, then the student might be placed in a smaller classroom such as a [[resource room]].

Parent of students with a learning disability must know what type of disability their child has, so they can get accommodations such as speech therapy, occupational therapy and adaptive physical education.For example, if a student takes an academic test and it indicates that the student struggles with reading comprehension, parents can request speech and language support or classroom accommodations, such as extra time to complete reading and writing tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Special Education Process Explained|url=http://www.specialeducationguide.com/pre-k-12/what-is-special-education/the-special-education-process-explained/|website=Special Education Guide|accessdate=22 March 2016|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of provision==
[[Image:PS 721 Spec Ed jeh.JPG|thumb|PS 721, a [[special school]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]] exclusively for the education of students with special needs]]

Schools use different approaches to providing special education services to students. These approaches can be broadly grouped into four categories, according to how much contact the student with special needs has with non-disabled students (using North American terminology):

* ''[[Inclusion (education)|Inclusion]]:'' In this approach, students with special needs spend all, or most of the school day with students who do not have special needs. Because inclusion can require substantial modification of the general curriculum, most schools use it only for selected students with mild to moderate special needs, which is accepted as a [[best practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith P |title=Have we made any progress?

Students may occasionally leave the regular classroom to attend smaller, more intensive instructional sessions in a [[resource room]], or to receive other related services that might require specialised equipment or might be disruptive to the rest of the class, such as [[speech and language therapy]], [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], [[rehabilitation counseling]]. They might also leave the regular classroom for services that require privacy, such as counseling sessions with a [[social worker]].&lt;ref name=Bowe&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowe, Frank |title=Making Inclusion Work |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-13-017603-6 |oclc=54374653}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Mainstreaming (education)|Mainstreaming]]'' refers to the practice of educating students with [[special needs]] in classes with non-disabled students during specific time periods based on their skills. Students with special needs are segregated in separate classes exclusively for students with special needs for the rest of the school day.&lt;ref name="Teachers, Schools, and Society"&gt;{{cite book

* ''Segregation'' in a separate classroom or special school for students with special needs: In this model, students with special needs do not attend classes with non-disabled students. Segregated students may attend the same school where regular classes are provided, but spend all instructional time exclusively in a separate classroom for students with special needs. If their special class is located in an ordinary school, they may be provided opportunities for social integration outside the classroom, such as by eating meals with non-disabled students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/warnock/warnock07.html Warnock Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111230317/http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/warnock/warnock07.html |date=11 January 2013 }} (1978).

In the past, most students with special needs have been excluded from school.&lt;ref&gt;Wolffe, Jerry. (20 December 2010) [https://archive.is/20130105014730/http://www.theoaklandpress.com/articles/2010/12/20/news/doc4d0fc3a6b0867472513928.txt?viewmode=fullstory What the law requires for disabled students] ''The Oakland Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; Such exclusion still affects about 23 million disabled children worldwide, particularly in poor, rural areas of developing countries.&lt;ref name=Hicks&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15183284|title=Disabled children excluded from education|last=Hicks|first=Bill|date=18 November 2011|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also occur when a student is in hospital, housebound, or detained by the criminal justice system. These students may receive one-on-one instruction or group instruction. Students who have been [[suspension (punishment)|suspended]] or [[expulsion (academia)|expelled]] are not considered excluded in this sense.
* ‘’[[Co-Teaching]]:’’ In this setting, students with disabilities are placed in a General education classroom to learn along with their disabled peers and non-disabled peers. A General Education teacher and a Special Education teacher work as partners in instruction.

===Effective Instruction for students with disabilities===

* ''Goal Directed'': Each child must have an individualised Education Program (IEP) that distinguishes his/her particular needs. The child must get the services that are designed for him/her. These services will allow him/her to reach his/her annual goals which will be assessed at the end of each term along with short-term goals that will be assessed every few months.
* ''Research-Based Methods''- There has been a lot of research done about students with disabilities and the best way to teach them. Testing, IQs, interviews, the discrepancy model, etc. should all be used to determine where to place the child. Once that is determined, the next step is the best way for the child to learn. There are plenty of different programs such as the Wilson Reading Program and Direct Instruction
* ''Guided by student performance''- While the IEP goals may be assessed every few months to a year, constant informal assessments must take place. These assessments will guide instruction for the teacher. The teacher will be able to determine if the material is too difficult or to easy.&lt;ref name="Bos, C. S. 2005"&gt;Bos, C. S. &amp; Vaughn, S. (2005). Strategies for teaching students with learning and behavior problems. (6th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special schools===
A ''special school'' is a school catering for students who have special educational needs due to [[learning disabilities|learning difficulties]], physical [[disabilities]] or behavioural problems. Special schools may be specifically designed, staffed and resourced to provide appropriate special education for children with additional needs. Students attending special schools generally do not attend any classes in mainstream schools.

Special schools provide individualised education, addressing specific needs. Student to teacher ratios are kept low, often 6:1 or lower depending upon the needs of the children. Special schools will also have other facilities for children with special needs, such as soft play areas, [[Sensory perception|sensory]] rooms, or [[swimming pool]]s, which are necessary for treating students with certain conditions.

In recent times, places available in special schools are declining as more children with special needs are educated in [[Inclusion (education)|mainstream schools]]. However, there will always be some children, whose learning needs cannot be appropriately met in a regular classroom setting and will require specialised education and resources to provide the level of support they require. An example of a disability that may require a student to attend a special school is intellectual disability. However, this practice is often frowned upon by school districts in the US in the light of Least Restrictive Environment as mandated in the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Ron (2002). "Exceptional Lives: Special Education in Today's Schools (3rd ed.)Merrill Prentice Hall. New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative is a '''special unit''' or '''special classroom''', also called a '''self-contained classroom''', which is a separate room or rooms dedicated solely to the education of students with special needs within a larger school that also provides general education. These classrooms are typically staffed by specially trained teachers, who provide specific, individualised instruction to individuals and small groups of students with special needs. Self-contained classrooms, because they are located in a general education school, may have students who remain in the self-contained classroom full-time, or students who are [[mainstreaming (education)|included]] in certain general education classes. In the United States a part-time alternative that is appropriate for some students is sometimes called a [[resource room]].

====History of special schools====
One of the first special schools in the world was the [[Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles]] in Paris, which was founded in 1784. It was the first school in the world to teach [[Blindness|blind]] students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inja.fr/inja/htmgen/SimHTMLGen.asp?FORM=0&amp;STYLE=2&amp;URL=/pages-infos/pages/informations_generales/presentation_de_l_inja/histoire-inja/histoirinja_sommaire.xhtml&amp;CSS=1 History of the INJA]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720233247/http://www.inja.fr/inja/htmgen/SimHTMLGen.asp?FORM=0&amp;STYLE=2&amp;URL=%2Fpages-infos%2Fpages%2Finformations_generales%2Fpresentation_de_l_inja%2Fhistoire-inja%2Fhistoirinja_sommaire.xhtml&amp;CSS=1 |date=20 July 2011 }} {{Fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first school in U.K, for the Deaf was established 1760 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/deafed/Session%202A.htm |title=Session 2A |publisher=Bris.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connerprairie.org/Learn-And-Do/Indiana-History/America-1800-1860/Education-Of-The-Deaf.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922095519/http://www.connerprairie.org/Learn-And-Do/Indiana-History/America-1800-1860/Education-Of-The-Deaf.aspx |archivedate=22 September 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Edinburgh by [[Thomas Braidwood]], with education for [[Blindness and education|visually impaired]] people beginning in the Edinburgh and Bristol in 1765.

In the 19th century, people with disabilities and the inhumane conditions where they were supposedly housed and educated were addressed in the literature of [[Charles Dickens]]. Dickens characterized people with severe disabilities as having the same, if not more, compassion and insight in [[Bleak House]] and [[Little Dorrit]].&lt;ref&gt;''The history of special education: From isolation to integration''. MA Winzer&lt;/ref&gt;

Such attention to the downtrodden conditions of people with disabilities brought resulted in reforms in Europe including the re-evaluation of special schools. In the United States reform came more slowly. Throughout the mid half of the 20th century, special schools, termed institutions, were not only accepted, but encouraged. Students with disabilities were housed with people with [[mental illness]]es, and they were not educated much, if at all.&lt;ref&gt;Inventing the feeble mind: A history of mental retardation in the United States. S McCuen – ''Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law'', 1997 – Duke Univ Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Deinstitutionalization proceeded in the US beginning in the 1970s following the exposes of the institutions, and it has taken sometime before the Education for All Handicapped Children's Act of 1974, to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and then Individuals with Disabilities Educational Improvement Act (IDEIA) have come into fruition.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, H. R., Beegle, R. &amp; Stowe, M.J. (2007). Public policy and developmental disabilities: A 35-year retrospective and a 5-year prospective on the core concepts in disability. In: S. Odom, R.H. Horner, M.E. Snell, &amp; J. Blacher, ''Handbook on Developmental Disabilities'', 15-34. London: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; School integration was supported as early as the 1970s, and teacher preparation programs in higher education have carefully taught and instructed graduates on inclusion at the classroom, individual, school, and district levels for decades resulting in dual certification of "regular teachers".

With the Amendments to the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1997]], school districts in the United States began to slowly integrate students with moderate and severe special needs into regular school systems. This changed the form and function of special education services in many school districts and special schools subsequently saw a steady decrease in enrollment as districts weighed the cost per student. It also posed general funding dilemmas to certain local schools and districts, changed how schools view assessments, and formally introduced the concept of [[Inclusion (education)|inclusion]] to many educators, students and parents.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, C.M. (1998). ''Restructuring high school for all students: Taking inclusion to the next level''. Baltimore: Paul H. Brooks Publishing co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instructional strategies==
{{Anchor|Modifications|Accommodations}}
&lt;!--  This section does not discuss *where* the student is taught.  Please discuss *how* the student is taught.  --&gt;

The student can be taught in either a classroom or outside environment. Both environments can be interactive for the student to engage better with the subject.&lt;ref&gt;http://rse.sagepub.com/content/9/6/29.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;

Different instructional techniques are used for some students with special educational needs. Instructional strategies are classified as being either ''accommodations'' or ''modifications''.

An ''accommodation'' is a reasonable adjustment to teaching practices so that the student learns the same material, but in a format that is more accessible to the student. Accommodations may be classified by whether they change the presentation, response, setting, or scheduling of lessons.&lt;ref name=Ofqual&gt;{{cite report

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the school may modify a reading assignment for a student with reading difficulties by substituting a shorter, easier book. A student may receive both accommodations and modifications.

;Examples of modifications:
* Skipping subjects: Students may be taught less information than typical students, skipping over material that the school deems inappropriate for the student's abilities or less important than other subjects. For example, students with poor fine motor skills may be taught to print [[block letters]], but not [[cursive]] handwriting.
* Simplified assignments: Students may read the same literature as their peers but have a simpler version, such as Shakespeare with both the original text and a modern paraphrase available.&lt;ref&gt;Thorson, Sue.  "Macbeth in the Resource Room: Students with Learning Disabilities Study Shakespeare."  ''Journal of Learning Disabilities'', v28 n9 p575-81 Nov 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shorter assignments: Students may do shorter homework assignments or take shorter, more concentrated tests.
* Extra aids: If students have deficiencies in working memory, a list of vocabulary words, called a ''word bank'', can be provided during tests, to reduce lack of recall and increase chances of comprehension. Students might use a calculator when other students do not.
* Extended time: Students with a slower processing speed may benefit from extended time for assignments and/or tests in order to have more time to comprehend questions, recall information, and synthesize knowledge.
* Students can be offered a flexible setting in which to take tests. These settings can be a new location to provide for minimal distractions.

;Examples of accommodations:
* Response accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual/&gt; Typing homework assignments rather than hand-writing them (considered a modification if the subject is [[penmanship|learning to write by hand]]). Having someone else write down answers given verbally.
* Presentation accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual/&gt; Examples include listening to [[audiobook]]s rather than reading printed books. These may be used as substitutes for the text, or as supplements intended to improve the students' reading fluency and phonetic skills. Similar options include designating a person to read to the student, or providing [[text to speech]] software. This is considered a modification if the purpose of the assignment is [[Learning to read|reading skills acquisition]]. Other presentation accommodations may include designating a person to take notes during lectures or using a talking [[calculator]] rather than one with only a visual display.
* Setting accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual/&gt; Taking a test in a quieter room. Moving the class to a room that is physically accessible, e.g., on the first floor of a building or near an [[elevator]]. Arranging seating assignments to benefit the student, e.g., by sitting at the front of the classroom.
* Scheduling accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Students may be given rest breaks or extended time on tests (may be considered a modification, if speed is a factor in the test). Use a timer to help with time management.

All developed countries permit or require some degree of accommodation for students with special needs, and special provisions are usually made in examinations which take place at the end of formal schooling.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

In addition to how the student is taught the academic curriculum, schools may provide non-academic services to the student. These are intended ultimately to increase the student's personal and academic abilities. Related services include developmental, corrective, and other supportive services as are required to assist a student with special needs and includes [[speech and language pathology]], [[audiology]], psychological services, [[physical therapy]], [[occupational therapy]], counseling services, including [[rehabilitation counseling]], orientation and mobility services, medical services as defined by regulations, parent counseling and training, school health services, school social work, assistive technology services, other appropriate developmental or corrective support services, appropriate access to recreation and other appropriate support services.&lt;ref name="Related Services"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, most related services are provided by the schools; in others, they are provided by the normal healthcare and social services systems.

As an example, students who have [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s, poor impulse control, or other behavioral challenges may learn self-management techniques, be kept closely on a comfortingly predictable schedule, or given extra cues to signal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Simpson, Richard L. |author2=Sonja R. de Boer |title=Successful inclusion for students with autism: creating a complete, effective ASD inclusion program |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=San Francisco |year=2009 |pages=38–42 |isbn=0-470-23080-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A university field, termed ''severe disabilities'', also is taught throughout the US university sector in schools of education. Advanced instruction is based upon community-referenced instruction, and alignment with transition to adulthood and progressive community practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Snell, M.E. |author2=Brown, F. |year=2011 |title=Instruction of Students with Severe Disabilities |edition=7th |publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rehabilitation counseling personnel are often association with [[supported employment]] services, and typically with "transition to adulthood" &lt;ref&gt;Rusch, F.R., DeStefano, L., Chadsey-Rusch, J., Phelps, L.A., &amp; Szymanski, E. (1992). ''Transition from School to Adult Life: Models, Linkages and Policies''. Sycamore, IL:Sycamore Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, D. &amp; Ferguson, P. (1987/2011). The promise of adulthood. In: M. Snell &amp; F. Brown, ''Instruction of Students with Severe Disabilities''. Madrid: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; in which multi-decade recommendations for better coordination between the school and the community service sectors have been made at the federal and university levels.

==Issues==
At-risk students (those with educational needs that are not associated with a disability) are often placed in classes with students who have disabilities. Critics assert that placing at-risk students in the same classes as students with disabilities may impede the educational progress of people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Greenwood CR |title=Longitudinal analysis of time, engagement, and achievement in at-risk versus non-risk students |journal=Except Child |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=521–35 |date=May 1991  |pmid=2070811 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some special education classes have been criticized for a watered-down curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldonline.org/article/Watering_Up_the_Curriculum_for_Adolescents_with_Learning_Disabilities,_Part_I:_Goals_of_the_Knowledge_Dimension |title=Watering Up the Curriculum for Adolescents with Learning Disabilities, Part I: Goals of the Knowledge Dimension |accessdate=2010-04-21 |last=Ellis |first=Edwin |year=2002 |publisher=WETA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of inclusion (in mainstream classrooms) has been criticized by advocates and some parents of children with special needs because some of these students require instructional methods that differ dramatically from typical classroom methods. Critics assert that it is not possible to deliver effectively two or more very different instructional methods in the same classroom. As a result, the educational progress of students who depend on different instructional methods to learn often fall even further behind their peers.&lt;ref name=Breckenridge&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://publicculture.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/citation/13/3/349 |title=The Critical Limits of Embodiment: Disability's Criticism |author=Carol A.

Parents of typically developing children sometimes fear that the special needs of a single "fully included" student will take critical levels of attention and energy away from the rest of the class and thereby impair the academic achievements of all students.&lt;ref name=Breckenridge/&gt;

Linked to this, there is debate about the extent to which students with special needs, whether in mainstream or special settings, should have a specific pedagogy, based on the scientific study of particular diagnostic categories, or whether general instructional techniques are relevant to all students including those with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lews|first1=Ann|last2=Norwich|first2=Brahm|title=Special Teaching for Special Children?|date=2005|publisher=Open University Press|location=Milton Keynes, UK|isbn=0335214053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mintz|first1=Joseph|title=Professional Uncertainty, Knowledge and Relationship in the Classroom: A Psycho-social Perspective|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415822961|url=http://routledge-ny.com/books/details/9780415822961/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parents, advocates, and students have concerns about the eligibility criteria and their application. In some cases, parents and students protest the students' placement into special education programs. For example, a student may be placed into the special education programs due to a mental health condition such as [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[panic attack]]s or [[ADHD]], while the student and his parents believe that the condition is adequately managed through medication and outside therapy. In other cases, students whose parents believe they require the additional support of special education services are denied participation in the program based on the eligibility criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5001996968|title=Development And Validation Of A Process For Screening Referrals To Special Education |author=Amanda M. Vanderheyden |author2=Joseph C Witt |author3=Gale Naquin  |year=2003 |journal=School Psychology Review|volume=32 |publisher=Research and Read Books, Journals, Articles at Questia Online Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether it is useful and appropriate to attempt to educate the most severely disabled children, such as children who are in a [[persistent vegetative state]], is debated. While many severely disabled children can learn simple tasks, such as pushing a buzzer when they want attention, some children may be incapable of learning. Some parents and advocates say that these children would be better served by substituting improved physical care for any academic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/education/20donovan.html?pagewanted=all
|title = A Struggle to Educate the Severely Disabled
|newspaper = The New York Times
|author = Otterman, Sharon
|date = 19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, they question whether teaching such non-academic subjects, such as pushing a buzzer, is properly the job of the school system, rather than the health care system.

Another large issue is the lack of resources enabling individuals with special needs to receive an education in the developing world. As a consequence, 98 percent of children with [[Disability and Poverty|special needs in developing countries]] do not have access to education.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. (1995). Review of the present situation in special education. Webaccessed: http://www.unesco.org/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_C133AD0AF05E62AC54C2DE8EE1C026DABFAF3000/filename/281_79.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue would be budget cuts. Cuts can affect special education students who don't have access to proper equipment or education. The National Coalition for Personal Shortages did a survey and almost 100% of the teachers said that they are not able to give the proper rights to children with disabilities. Teachers are getting cut off from work due to the budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f8ad9957-dcd5-4bd6-9000-d2db068bc640@sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4201{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a financial debate that covers the use and allotment of special education government funding. The three views on this topic are that we spend too much money on it, there is not enough money put into it or that the money that is given isn't being spent properly. The argument for the first is that the amount of money spent on one special needs child is enough to cover a large group of general education students, and sometimes even causes several students to suffer budget cuts on general programs to support one child. The evidence for special education not having enough money is the lack of teachers, burnt out teachers and a limited variety of teaching tools for each student. The argument to spend the money differently states that there is a lot of money set aside, but that it is being wasted by spending too much time on paperwork, inefficient IEP meetings or spending money on things that don't actually benefit the child.&lt;ref&gt;https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED427399&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global issues ===
Children with disabilities are often denied their right to education. However, little is known about their school attendance patterns. The collection of data on children with disabilities is not straightforward, but data are vital to ensure that policies are in place to address the constraints these children face.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location= |pages=44, Box 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNESCO|first=|year=2014|title=Teaching and Learning: Achieving quality for all|url=|journal=EFA Global Monitoring Report 2013-2014|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By one estimate, 93 million children under age 14, or 5.1% of the world's children, were living with a ‘moderate or severe disability’ in 2004. According to the World Health Survey, in 14 of 15 low and middle income countries, people of working age with disabilities were about one-third less likely to have completed primary school. For example, in [[Bangladesh]], 30% of people with disabilities had completed primary school, compared with 48% of those with no disabilities. The corresponding shares were 43% and 57% in [[Zambia]]; 56% and 72% in [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

It has been shown that children with a higher risk of disability are far more likely to be denied a chance to go to school. In Bangladesh, [[Bhutan]] and [[Iraq]], children with mental impairments were most likely to be denied this right. In Iraq, for instance, 10% of 6- to 9-year-olds with no risk of disability had never been to school in 2006, but 19% of those at risk of having a hearing impairment and 51% of those who were at higher risk of mental disability had never been to school. In [[Thailand]], almost all 6- to 9-year-olds who had no disability had been to school in 2005/06, and yet 34% of those with walking or moving impairments had never been to school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

Children with disabilities require access to services that can support them throughout their time in school, such as more individual attention from instructors. According to the United Nations Centre for Human Rights, about 2% of children with disabilities have access to these services. Those without access to these services are excluded from education and unable to attend school.

;South Africa

Both modifications and accommodations are recommended, depending on the student's individual needs.

;Japan
{{Main|Education in Japan}}

Japanese students with special needs are placed in one of four different school arrangements: [[special school]]s, special classrooms with another school, in [[resource rooms]] (which are called ''tsukyu''), or in regular classrooms.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Special schools are reserved for students whose severe disabilities cannot be accommodated in the local school.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; They do not use the same grading or marking systems as mainstream schools, but instead assess students according to their individualized plans.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Special classes are similar, and may vary the national curriculum as the teachers see fit. ''Tsukyu'' are [[resource room]]s that students with milder problems use part-time for specialized instruction individually in small groups. These students spend the rest of the day in the mainstream classroom. Some students with special needs are fully included in the mainstream classroom, with accommodations or modifications as needed.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Training of disabled students, particularly at the upper-secondary level, emphasizes vocational education to enable students to be as independent as possible within society. Vocational training varies considerably depending on the student's disability, but the options are limited for some. It is clear that the government is aware of the necessity of broadening the range of possibilities for these students. Advancement to higher education is also a goal of the government, and it struggles to have institutions of higher learning accept more disabled students.

;Pakistan
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
After independence (1947), Pakistan had to face some serious challenges, due to which no proper emphasis was given to special education and even education. Among other reasons, lack of resources, financial as well as human, was the major one in this context. The need and importance of special education was felt in different educational policies of Pakistan in different times. At the first time, in its report, the Commission on National Education (1959) highlighted the importance of special education. After that the Education Policy (1972) and the National Policy and Implementation Programme (1979) gave some importance to this sector. The same was also reflected in different medium-term (five-year) plans. This was felt more seriously when the Directorate General of Special Education, Islamabad formulated a draft National Policy for Special Education in 1986 and revised it in 1988 to bring it in line with the emerging needs of special/disabled population. After that a special education policy was launched in 1999. Recently, Government of Pakistan has launched a new National Policy for Persons with Disabilities 2002, which is dynamically being implemented.

Special education is regulated centrally by the Singapore Ministry of Education.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Both [[special school]]s and integration into mainstream schools are options for students with special educational needs, but most students with disabilities are placed in special schools.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Students with special education who wish accommodations on national exams must provide appropriate documentation to prove that they are disabled.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Accommodations, but not modifications (e.g., simpler questions) are normally approved if they are similar to the accommodations already being used in everyday schoolwork, with the goal of maintaining the exam's integrity while not having students unfairly disadvantaged by factors that are unrelated to what is being tested. The accommodations are listed on the Primary School Leaving Exam.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

With respect to standardized tests, special consideration procedures are in place in all states for students who are disabled.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Students must provide documentation Not all desired forms of accommodations are available. For example, students who cannot read, even if the inability to read is due to a disability, cannot have the exam read to them, because the exam results should accurately show that the student is unable to read. Reports on matriculation exams do not mention whether the student received any accommodations in taking the test.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

[[File:Kötitz Rathaus.JPG|thumb|A special school for children with special emotional needs in Kötitz, Germany]]

Most students with special needs in Germany attend a [[special school]] that serves only children with special needs. These include:
* ''Förderschule für Lernbehinderte'' (special school for learning disabilities): for children who have challenges that impair learning
* ''Förderschule mit dem Förderschwerpunkt Geistige Entwicklung'' (school for cognitive development): for children with very severe learning challenges
* ''Förderschule Schwerpunkt emotionale und soziale Entwicklung'' (school for emotional and social development): for children who have special emotional needs
* ''Förderschule für Blinde'' (school for the blind): for blind children
* ''Förderschule für Sehbehinderte'' (school for the visually impaired): for children who are visually challenged
* ''Förderschule für Gehörlose'' (school for the deaf): for deaf children
* ''Förderschule für Schwerhörige'' (school for the hearing impaired): for children who are hearing impaired
* ''Förderschule für Körperbehinderte'' (school for children with physical disabilities): for children with physical disabilities
* ''Förderschule für Sprachbehinderte'' (school for children with language disorders): for children with language disorders
* ''Förderschule für Taubblinde'' (school for the deafblind): for children who are deafblind
* ''Schule für Kranke'' (school for ill children): for children who are too ill to attend school or are hospitalized for a longer period of time.
* ''Förderschule für schwer mehrfach Behinderte'' (school for children with severe and multiple disabilities): for children with severe and multiple disabilities who need very special care and attention. Sometimes these children are only susceptible for very basic emotional and sensory stimulation. Thus teachers at these school (as well as at schools for the deafblind) are highly specialized professionals.

One in 21 German students attends a special school. Teachers at those schools are specially trained professionals who have specialized in special needs education while in university. Special schools often have a very favorable student-teacher ratio and facilities other schools do not have.

Some special needs children in Germany do not attend a special school, but are educated in a mainstream school such as a [[Hauptschule]] or [[Gesamtschule]] (comprehensive school).

Students with special educational needs may be exempted from standardized tests or given modified tests.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

;Greece

Greek students with special needs may attend either mainstream schools or special schools.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Students whose disabilities have been certified may be exempted from some standardized tests or given alternative tests.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Accommodations are responsive to students' needs; for example, students with visual impairments may take oral tests, and students with hearing impairments take written tests. Accommodations and modifications are noted on the certificate of achievement.

As a general rule, students with special educational needs are integrated into their regular, mainstream schools with appropriate support, under the "Going to School Together" policy (''Weer Samen Naar School'').&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Four types of disability-specific special schools exist. The national policy is moving towards "suitable education" (''passend onderwijs''), based on the individual's strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

'''Norway'''

The National Support System for Special Needs Education (Statped) is managed by the [[Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training]]. The general objective for Statped is to give guidance and support to those in charge of the education in municipalities and county administrations to ensure that children, young people and adults with major and special educational needs are secured well-advised educational and developmental provisions. The institutions affiliated with Statped offer a broad spectrum of services. Statped consists of 13 resource centres owned by the State, and 4 units for special education, where Statped buys services. These centres offer special educational guidance and support for local authorities and county administrations.

Students with disabilities have a "guaranteed right" to appropriate accommodations on assessments.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Schools are generally considered autonomous.

;Slovenia

On national tests, the National Examination Center normally grants most requests for accommodations that are supported by the local school's examination committee. Legislation opposes the use of modifications that would be unfair to non-disabled students.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

;Spain

Schools are required to provide services and resources to students with special educational needs so that they make progress and participate in school.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; If the local school is unable to provide appropriately for an individual student, then the student may be transferred to a special school.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Spanish non-governmental organizations like [[ONCE]] have traditionally provided significant services to students with disabilities.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

;Sweden

Local schools have significant autonomy, based on national guidelines. Schools are expected to help students meet the goals that are set for them.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

There are special schools (Swedish:Särskola) for students with low abilities to attend normal education. There has in 2012-2013 been media criticism on the fact that students with light problems such as [[dyslexia]] have been placed in special schools, seriously hampering their chances on the labour market.

;Switzerland

Education is controlled by the 26 cantons, and so special education programs vary from place to place.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; However, integration is typical.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Students are assessed according to their individual learning goals.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

'''United Kingdom'''

In [[England and Wales]] the [[acronym]] ''SEN'' for [[Special Educational Needs]] denotes the condition of having special educational needs, the services which provide the support and the programmes and staff which implement the education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/wholeschool/sen/ |title=Special education needs, Special needs education |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306171514/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/wholeschool/sen/ |archivedate=6 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In England ''SEN PPS'' refers to the Special Educational Needs Parent Partnership Service. ''SENAS'' is the special educational needs assessment service, which is part of the Local Authority. ''SENCO'' refers to a special educational needs coordinator, who usually works with schools and the children within schools who have special educational needs. The Special Educational Needs Parent Partnership Services help parents with the planning and delivery of their child's educational provision. The [[Department for Education]] oversees special education in England.

Most students have an individual educational plan, but students may have a group plan in addition to, or instead of, an individual plan. Group plans are used when a group of students all have similar goals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5vhVPZoIG?url=http://education.staffordshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/6C2C3FF2-43F1-40A4-AB6F-77E4CC4602F6/22865/SENCOResourceCentreCompletedocument2.pdf Management of Inclusion].  The SENCO Resource Centre, part 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scotland]] the [[Additional Support Needs Act]] places an obligation on education authorities to meet the needs of all students in consultation with other agencies and parents. In [[Scotland]] the term Special Educational Needs (SEN), and its variants are not official terminology although the very recent implementation of the [[Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004|Additional Support for Learning Act]] means that both ''SEN'' and ''ASN'' (Additional Support Needs) are used interchangeably in current common practice.

;Turkey

At a young age students who have special needs in Turkey are provided special education from [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|The Ministry of Education]], who are responsible in giving them the education that they need.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/turkey/family/schooling-education/special-needs-education|title=Special Needs Education in Turkey - Turkey - Angloinfo|work=Angloinfo|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417154851/https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/turkey/family/schooling-education/special-needs-education|archive-date=17 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to get special education you are required certain things:
* "Residency certificate&amp;nbsp;
* Written application by the parents to the school administration&amp;nbsp;
* Personal development report of the child (if already registered)&amp;nbsp;
* Child's health report from the hospital." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  
All special-needs students receive an [[Individualized Education Program]] (BEP) that outlines how the school will meet the student's individual needs. The [[Özel Eğitim Kurumları Yönetmeliği]] (ÖEKY) requires that students with special needs be provided with a [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] in the [[Least Restrictive Environment]] that is appropriate to the student's needs. Government-run schools provide special education in varying degrees from the least restrictive settings, such as full inclusion, to the most restrictive settings, such as segregation in a [[special school]].

The education offered by the school must be appropriate to the student's individual needs. Schools are not required to maximize the student's potential or to provide the best possible services. Unlike most of the developed world, American schools are also required to provide many medical services, such as [[speech therapy]], if the student needs these services.

According to the Department of Education, approximately 10 percent of all school-aged children) currently receive some type of special education services.

As with most countries in the world, students who are poor, ethnic minorities, or do not speak the dominant language fluently are disproportionately identified as needing special education services.

Before 1978, little action was taken to educate children with disabilities in Columbia. Children would be left home without much interaction with the outside world. In 1985, special education was researched across the country and education programs were created.

The history of special education in Colombia can be categorized into three time periods: the period of neglect, the period of diagnosis and planning, and the emergence of special education. The period of planning ran from the years 1978 to the year 1990. The Ministry of Colombia in 1995 implemented a national plan for the development of special education called "Plan Nacional para el Desarrollo de la Education Especial". The purposes of the plan was to create a national diagnosis of special education and to initiate programs for individuals with disabilities. In 1994, the Ministry of education put the first law into action to introduce special classes in public schools that include students with disabilities, called Law 115. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cuadros|first=Jose|date=May 2005|title=The Status of Disability in Colombia and the Importance of Parental Perceptions on the Development of Special Education|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ966524.pdf|journal=Teaching Exceptional Children Plus|volume=1|pages=8|via=google scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2011, Colombia entered into the Convention of Rights of Persons with Disabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamenopoulou|first=Leda|date=2018|title=Inclusive Education in the global South?

The most recent development of special education in Colombia was Article 11 of Law 1618, which was passed in 2013. The law states that "the Ministry of Education will define the policy and regulate the scheme of education for persons with special educational needs, promoting educational access and quality under a system based on inclusion in the educational services".

All special-needs students receive an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) that outlines how the school will meet the student's individual needs. The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) requires that students with special needs be provided with a [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] in the [[Least Restrictive Environment]] that is appropriate to the student's needs.

Unlike most of the developed world, American schools are also required to provide many medical services, such as [[speech therapy]], if the student needs these services.

According to the Department of Education, approximately 6 million children (roughly 10 percent of all school-aged children) currently receive some type of special education services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.rethinkingschools.org/restrict.asp?path=archive/16_03/Hist163.shtml |title=The History of Special Education|author=Priscilla Pardini |year= 2002 |journal=Rethinking Schools |volume=16 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with most countries in the world, students who are poor, ethnic minorities, or do not speak the dominant language fluently are disproportionately identified as needing special education services.&lt;ref name=Blanchett /&gt; Poor, black and Latino urban schools are more likely to have limited resources and to employ inexperienced teachers that do not cope well with student behavior problems, "thereby increasing the number of students they referred to special education."&lt;ref&gt;Tejeda-Delgado, M.

During the 1960s, in some part due to the [[civil rights movement]], some researchers began to study the disparity of education amongst people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ladson-Billings, Gloria |title=The dreamkeepers: successful teachers of African American children |publisher=Jossey-Bass Publishers |location=San Francisco |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=1-55542-668-9 |oclc=30072651}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landmark [[Brown v. Board of Education]] decision, which declared unconstitutional the "[[separate but equal]]" arrangements in public schools for students of different races, paved the way for [[PARC v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] and [[Mills vs. Board of Education of District of Columbia]], which challenged the segregation of students with special needs. Courts ruled that unnecessary and inappropriate segregation of students with disabilities was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=Blanchett&gt;Blanchett, W. J. (2009). A retrospective examination of urban education: From "brown" to the resegregation of African Americans in special education—it is time to "go for broke". Urban Education, 44(4), 370–388.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress responded to these court rulings with the federal [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] in 1975 (since renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)). This law required schools to provide services to students previously denied access to an appropriate education.

In US government-run schools, the dominant model is [[inclusion (education)|inclusion]]. In the United States, three out of five students with academic learning challenges spend the overwhelming majority of their time in the regular classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Cortiella, C. (2009).

== Integrating technology in special ed. classrooms ==

=== Autism ===
Autism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), refers to a range of conditions. These conditions involve challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. They also involve unique strengths and differences. 

[[Autism]] is known as a disability that impairs the social interactions and communication skills of a person. People who are autistic tend to think and act differently than others. Many children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) find themselves comfortable with a device in their hands.&amp;nbsp;For students with autism, there are apps called "visual scene displays" that are most helpful for children who are having difficulty with verbal skills, according to Jules Csillag, a speech-language pathologist who focuses on special ed tech. Apps such as SceneSpeak and Speech with Milo help autistic children develop storytelling skills with text-to-speech voice and interactive storybooks. Using apps like these in a classroom can improve autistic student's verbal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/20/teaching-technology-autism_n_6865030.html|title=The Technology That's Giving Students With Autism a Greater Voice|date=2015-04-20|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several controversies surrounding the diagnoses and causes of autism. It's now believed that there's no single cause of autism. Research seems to suggest that autism is normally the result of both genetic and environmental influences.

=== Down syndrome ===
If a student has [[down syndrome]], [[assistive technology]] can help with their learning experience. Author of&amp;nbsp;''Down Syndrome: A Promising Future, Together,''&amp;nbsp;Terry Hassold, who got his PhD in human genetics, explains that students with Down syndrome have delays with cognitive ability. Their brains have a late reaction when their neurological system sends a message for any task. Because of this late reaction, they tend to take longer to complete a task than an average students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Down_Syndrome.html?id=wuh9OlwsWaQC|title=Down Syndrome: A Promising Future, Together|last=Hassold|first=Terry J.|last2=Patterson|first2=David|date=1999|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780471296867|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistive technology is crucial in helping Down's students with their writing ability. Down syndrome children tend to have shorter, stubbier fingers and a lowered thumb making their ability to write more difficult. Also, some of the usual wrist bones are not formed, making it difficult to hold objects. Slanted desks are one type of assisted technology that can aid in the successful ability to write. A three-ring binder can be used to create a slanted desk by turning the binder sideways. Also, students with Down's often try to hold their pencils by anchoring them against the thumb rather than using the tip of their thumb. Shortened pencils or triangular-shaped pencils encourage students to hold them correctly. Using any of these assistive technologies can help down syndrome students during their educational process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://downsyndromepossibilities.blogspot.com/p/assisstive-technology.html|title=Down Syndrome: Assisstive Technology|website=Down Syndrome|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
Today many people with disabilities are breaking barriers through the use of technology. For some individuals with disabilities, assistive technology is a necessary tool that enables them to engage in or perform many tasks. Integrating technology will allow students to increase their self-confidence, self-motivation, independence and they will also be able to engage in different activities within the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csun.edu/~hfdss006/conf/2002/proceedings/16.htm|title=2002 Conference Proceedings|website=www.csun.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teaching artists''', also known as '''art teachers''' or '''artist educators''' or '''community artists''', are [[artist|professional artists]] who supplement their incomes by teaching and integrating their art form, perspectives, and skills into a wide range of settings, such as by showing kids how to make clay mugs with faces in local libraries and elementary schools. Teaching artists work with schools, [[After-school activity|after school programs]], community agencies, [[prison]]s, jails, and [[Social services|social service]] agencies. The ''Arts In Education'' movement benefited from the work of Teaching Artists in schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingartists.com/researchonTA.htm History of Teaching Artists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227120148/http://www.teachingartists.com/researchonTA.htm |date=2012-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arts learning consultant [[Eric Booth]] has defined a teaching artist, somewhat wordily, as "a practicing professional artist with the complementary skills, curiosities and sensibilities of an educator, who can effectively engage a wide range of people in learning experiences in, through, and about [[the arts]].”&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110823124354/http://nysaae.org/docs/The_History_of_Teaching_Artistry_By_Eric_Booth.pdf Booth Article]&lt;/ref&gt; This term applies to professional artists in all artistic fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachingartists.com/whatisaTA.htm Teaching Artist described] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723005527/http://www.teachingartists.com/whatisaTA.htm |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching Artists have worked in schools and in communities for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phillip Lopate]], ''Journal of a Living Experiment, a documentary history of Teachers &amp; Writers Collaborative and the writers-in-the-schools movement.''

'''Tenth grade''', '''sophomore year''', or '''grade 10''' (called [[Year 11]] in [[England]] and [[Wales]]) is the tenth year of school post-[[kindergarten]] or the tenth year after the first introductory year upon entering compulsory schooling.  In many parts of the world, the students are 15–16 years of age, depending on when their birthday occurs. The variants of 10th grade in various nations are described below.

==Australia==
[[Year 10]], for most Australian states, is the fourth year of a student's high school education. However, in the [[Northern Territory]], it is the first year of senior school, which occurs after high school. While in contrast, in most South Australian public schools, it is the third year of high school. For more in depth information on Australia's education system, see: [[Education in Australia]].

==Belgium==
In Belgium, the 10th grade is called ''4ème secondaire'' in French (Walloon), or ''4de middelbaar'' in Dutch (Flemish).

==Canada==
In Canada, '''Grade 10''' is the 10th year of mandatory schooling. Depending on province, it may be the first (grades 10-12 high school), second (grades 9-12 high school), third (grades 8-12 high school), or fourth year of high school (grades 7-11 high school) .

==Denmark==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
In Denmark the 10th grade may refer to an extra year of primary school. Earlier, 10th grade was mostly for people who had a hard time in primary school and needed an extra year to prepare for high school (or another secondary education of some sort), but nowadays, it is widely popular amongst challenged and gifted students alike and usual attended at a special kind of boarding school called an "Efterskole". 10th can also be attended at a regular school, though. This year is usually taken as a way to get a break from the school system and relax and try something different before moving on to high school. 
But, more commonly, people attend the "gymnasium" (can be compared to high school) where you go from 10th-12th grade (as such, some people attend 10th grade twice). People don't usually call the steps of the Danish gymnasium for 10th, 11th or 12th grade, but usually refer to them as 1st G, 2nd G, and 3rd G. Here, G is simply the letter "G", and it refers to the three different steps of the education.

==Finland==
In Finland tenth grade is usually known as the first year of High School ("Lukio" in Finnish and "Gymnasiet" in Swedish). The tenth grade may also refer to an extra year of primary school ("kymppiluokka" in Finnish which literally translates to "tenth grade"). This extra year of primary school is for those without a post-primary school study position or who need some more time to decide on their future.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infopankki.fi/en/living-in-finland/education/child-education/comprehensive-education&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
The tenth year of schooling in France is known as the [[:fr:Seconde (lycée)|Seconde]], so called because it is the second last in [[Secondary education in France|secondary education]].
It is the first year of High School ("Lycée")

==Greece==
In Greece, the 10th grade is referring to the 1st class of Lyceum ("1η Λυκείου") ("Pròti likìou). Lyceum is a form of a secondary school and it isn't compulsory for citizens to attend.

==Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, 10th grade is called Form 4.

==India==
The tenth grade (the tenth school year after [[kindergarten]]) is important in India. After the completion of the tenth grade, the student is required to sit for national board exams or state board exams wherein question papers are prepared and answer sheets are checked by a central institution to which the school is affiliated. The percentage scored in Class X decides what a student can opt for in Class XI (Science/Commerce/Arts). The Grade gains even more importance as in many parts of India the number of seats for Class XI is generally lower than the number of students who pass out Standard X.

The new system called CCE ([[Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation]]) was introduced by the Central Board of Secondary Education in India for students of sixth to tenth grades. The main aim of CCE is to evaluate every aspect of the child during their presence at the school.

However, since the academic year 2017-18 CCE has been scrapped and the old method of complete syllabus examination is in use.

==Ireland==
In [[Education in the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], it is the 4th year of [[Secondary School]] or '''[[Transition Year]]''' or '''[[Transition Year|Idirbhliain]]''' in [[Gaelscoil]]eanna. In most secondary schools optional subjects are introduced. Students continue normal classes but also have the opportunity to try new things such as work experience, participation in school stage productions or do other activities or courses such as ECDL or different sports. Students do not sit tests within this year.

==Israel==
In [[Education in Israel|Israel]], the tenth grade is the first year of high school (pronounced in [[Hebrew]] as ''Tichon'') in most formal places, which lasts three years. In some cities (such as [[Ramat Gan]], [[Givatayim]] and [[Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut]]), elementary school ends at 8th grade and high school starts at 9th grade.

==Italy==
In Italy, the tenth grade is the second  year of the high school (which  is called  Scuola media  superiore or scuola  secondaria  di secondo  grado). High school in Italy lasts five years.

==Malaysia==
In Malaysia, 10th grade also known as Form 4 in secondary school. The students at this stage are 16 years old, and it is the fourth year in the secondary school.
This is the year when the students choose their focus as either art/science for their upcoming studies.

==Mexico==
In [[Education in Mexico|Mexico]], the tenth grade is the beginning of the high school, which lasts only three years. Similar to Israel's education system. Tenth graders are normally aged 15–16.

==Nepal==
In Nepal, Grade 10th is the final year of Junior High. And Students gives SEE examination in Grade 10th after which They Qualify for +2(Senior High). They can choose Different subjects like Commerce, Science, Management, etc. in +2. They Should get minimum c+ in Science in Grade 10 to take Science. And Students can choose different subjects i.e. Optional Math or Optional English, Computer or Accounts in Grade 9. Students are generally of aged 15 or 16 in Grade 10.

==Netherlands==
In The Netherlands, the 10th grade (based on the level of compulsory secondary education) is the last (VMBO), second to last (HAVO), or fourth out of six (VWO) grades of high school. In all cases it is referred to as ''vierde klas'' or just ''de vierde'' (the fourth), because when you have finished elementary school, the grade numbers start over, beginning with one and going to either 4 (VMBO), 5 (HAVO) or 6 (VWO).

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, ''Year 11'' is the equivalent of tenth grade, with students aged 15 or 16 during the years. It is the third year of secondary school and the eleventh year of compulsory education. Year 11 is also the first year of the [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement]] (NCEA), the main national qualification for secondary school students in New Zealand. Students in Year 11 study English (or Te Reo Māori), mathematics, and a minimum of four elective subjects with a science subject highly recommended.

==Norway==
In [[Norway]], the tenth grade is the last year of compulsory education and the final year of ''Ungdomsskole'', equivalent to junior high school. The students enter the tenth grade the year they turn fifteen.

==Pakistan==
Grade ten is the final year of high school in [[Pakistan]]; it is an important year level as it here that [[matriculation]] examinations occur after which students can qualify for grades eleven and twelve in college. Successful completion of [[college]] allows eligibility for entrance into universities and higher education. Exams of class 10th usually held in March by examination boards called Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education.

==Philippines==
In the Philippines, Grade 10 is the fourth and last year of Junior High School. Topics mainly discussed are the following subjects like, for the major subjects are Trigonometry (Math in Grade 10), Physics (Science in Grade 10), Filipino subject with [[El Filibusterismo]], English and Philippine Contemporary Issues (Political Studies in Grade 10). Values Education, World Literature, MAPEH (Music, Arts, Physical Education and Health), Computer and TLE (Technology and Livelihood Education) are some of the minor subjects. Students are usually 15–16 years old.

==Russia==
In Russia, in the end of ninth grade students have a choice: to progress to the tenth grade in school or go to college. The tenth grade is the beginning of the high school, and it is a [[Unified State Exam|pre-exam]] year, when training to USE is being. Learning is similar with [[Ninth grade]], but priority is given to repeat the material learned in high school ([[Fifth grade|Fifth]] to [[Ninth grade|Ninth years]]).

==Singapore==
In [[Education in Singapore|Singapore]], 10th grade is equivalent of Secondary 4 level. Students are usually 16 years old and will take either the GCE 'N' Levels or the GCE 'O' Levels at the end of the year.

==South Africa==
In South Africa, ninth grade marks the end of a student's General Education and Training-phase. Children in South Africa are required to attend school up to the age of fifteen, or completion of the General Education and Training-phase, whichever comes first. Students have the option of continuing secondary school up to twelfth grade, under Further Education and Training. Upon successful completion of the twelfth grade, students are granted the National Senior Certificate.

==Spain==
In [[Education in Spain|Spain]], the tenth grade is 4th of E.S.O. (Obligatory Secondary Education, in Spanish "Educación Secundaria Obligatoria").

==Sweden==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
In Sweden, the tenth to twelfth grades are taken at a certain type of school called a 'Gymnasium'. After ninth grade, Swedish children end their compulsory schooling.  Therefore, these schools are significantly divided in terms of both abilities and career aims.  There are two overall types of programs (courses of study) that students can choose from at their schools. Each one is taught in its own separate place. Job-oriented programs (yrkesförberedande program) and programs that prepare for university college (högskoleförberedande program). There are then several programmes of the two types; for example the natural science program (naturvetenskapsprogrammet), which prepares for university college and focuses on subjects like physics, chemistry, biology and math or the construction programme (bygg och anläggningsprogrammet), which is a programme specialized for jobs in that sector. Other options among college preparatory program are for instance the social science program, specializing in social studies and subjects like civics, sociology, psychology, language and history.

For these higher schools students can pick a school that is specialized for the job they wish to take (yrkesförberedande gymnasium). At these schools only classes relevant to the classification of the school are taught, along with language, math and some civics skills. There are widely oriented schools such as General Arts, but also very specific schools, such as Equestrian.

Students that do not yet have any specific career aspirations, or wish to go to a school specialized for a profession that requires a gymnasial degree, can choose to move into a general school, which has programmes preparing for college university (högskoleförberedande program). The system there is very similar to the system from seventh grade to ninth grade except that the student has chosen a program which allows the student to focus on an (albeit in a somewhat general way) area of interest. For instance; the economics programme (ekonomiprogrammet) includes courses in business economics, entrepreneurship and other such courses along with general courses that all students going to schools which prepare for university college must take, such as math, language, civics, physical education etc.

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
For [[education in England]] and [[Education in Wales|Wales]], this is known as [[Year 11]].
General education certificates will be awarded if the pupils sit the end of year examinations, called [[GCSE]]s. In Year 11, students take their GCSEs. With grades ranging from 9 to 1, and the grade below 1 being U, these exams show proficiency in a range of subjects. Results of at least five 5 grades are considered a pass and many employers require their staff to have at least 5s in GCSE, including [[English studies|English]] and [[Maths]]. [[GCSE]]s are taken in May and June. Pupils may then go on to sit [[Advanced Level (UK)|'A' Levels]]. A new English Baccalaureate has been introduced; this is awarded to students who achieve a 9 to 5 in five subjects including English, [[Math]]s, [[science]], a [[humanities]] subject ([[history]] or [[geography]]) and a modern language or computer science.

===Scotland===
In [[Education in Scotland|Scotland]], tenth grade (the tenth year after kindergarten or entry into compulsory schooling) is called S4 (or fourth year). At the end of S4, students normally sit for examinations in six or seven [[National 5]] subjects in which they have studied over the previous two years. National 5's and are taken during the months of May and June. 
It is followed by an optional fifth year (S5) at school or pupils may choose to leave at the end of S4, provided they have reached the age of 16 by 30, September of that year. Those who wish to leave, but will not meet the September deadline, may do so provided that they have either secured an [[apprenticeship]] or a placement in a college designed for Christmas Leavers.  They are called this because there are two leaving dates in the academic year - the last day in May (summer leaving date), and the last day before the Christmas holidays (winter leaving date).  Hence the term "Christmas leavers".

==United States==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
The tenth grade is the tenth school year. Grade 10 is a part of high school,  and in most parts of the U.S. it is the second year of high school, with 11th then 12th following.

The term ''high school'' is often used to mean ''[[education in the united states#Junior and senior high school|senior high school]]'' and distinguished from '''[[education in the united states#Junior and senior high school|junior high school]]'''. Grades are used in determining a student's [[Grade Point Average|GPA]] (in the U.S.), and become part of a student's official transcript.

In the U.S. [[mathematics|math]], tenth  graders are usually taught [[geometry]]. Occasionally, [[trigonometry]], [[precalculus]], or higher classes, are offered for students who wish to take [[Advanced Placement]] math classes in later years of high.

In the U.S. [[curriculum]] for [[literature]], students have already begun to familiarize themselves with notable authors such as [[Shakespeare]], while some [[Advanced Placement]] programs emphasize the work of author [[J.D. Salinger]], for example, and his ''[[Catcher in the Rye]]'', putting a major emphasis on literary terms and getting to know themes such as ''[[Social alienation|alienation]]''. Generally, students at this grade will be taught [[World Literature]]. Like other classes, [[Honors course|Honors]] and [[Advanced Placement]] versions of this course are available.

In the U.S. [[curriculum]] for [[science]], tenth graders are usually taught [[chemistry]], [[biology]] or Integrated Science 1B. Like other classes, [[Advanced Placement]] Chemistry and/or Biology is available.

In the U.S. curriculum for [[Social Studies|social studies]], tenth grade students are taught recent [[World History]] or [[American History]]. In some districts, [[Advanced Placement]] coursework, such as [[geography]], [[European history]], [[World Studies]], or [[United States History]].

In the U.S., tenth grade is also known as [[sophomore]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dict&amp;freesearch=sophomore&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Based in New York City, the website launched in July 2015.

In August 2015, The 74 hosted an education summit in Manchester, New Hampshire, attended by Gov. [[Jeb Bush]], [[Carly Fiorina]], Gov. [[John Kasich]], Gov. [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]], Gov. [[Bobby Jindal]], and Gov. [[Chris Christie]], who were all Republican presidential candidates. The summit was sponsored by the American Federation for Children, the nation's leading school-choice advocacy organization.&lt;ref&gt;Killough, Ashley and LoBianco, Tom (August 19, 2015).

The 74 also scheduled a second education summit in Iowa to feature Democratic presidential candidates in conjunction with the ''[[The Des Moines Register|Des Moines Register]]'', the state's largest daily newspaper. However, the event was cancelled. In an interview with ''[[Politico]]'', Campbell Brown said Democratic candidates were unwilling to attend the event because of pressure from historically Democratic teachers unions eager to move the party away from school reforms implemented under [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/10/bowing-to-unions-2016-dems-skip-campbell-browns-education-forum-000272|title=Bowing to unions, 2016 Dems skip Campbell Brown’s education forum|last=Grunwald|first=Michael|date=October 7, 2015|work=|access-date=April 4, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, she adopted a baby boy and raised him completely on her own (something very rare for a woman to do, much less even fathom, at the time). She was survived by her son, a daughter-in-law, one younger sister, and several nieces, nephews, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.

The '''Universidad Del Pacífico – Ecuador : [[Business School|Escuela de Negocios]] (UPACIFICO)''' is an [[Ecuador]]ian non-profit [[private university]].

It focuses on its students ability to undertake business, to turn initiatives into economic realities, to organize activities, to assure development and stability of business, to locate resources and employ effective methods of production, development of [[risk management|risk-management]] capabilities and a working knowledge of the economic and political environment are some of the areas of instruction offered to students.

==Mission statement==
"To contribute to the economic and [[social development]] of the country by preparing men and women in business to enter an ever-changing world where they will use their skills to develop their own entrepreneurial ideas within an ethical context, led by mentors committed to academic excellence in order to develop coming generations as agents of change and as shapers of sustainable development."&lt;ref name= Mission&gt;[http://www.upacifico.edu.ec/Templates/Mision.html  Mission Universidad Del Pacífico].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1992, the idea of creating an institution to rescue the business culture in Ecuador, to form professional business leaders which strengthen this sector, was the inspiration for founding an [[academic institution]].  In June 1994, after a long preparation, research and curriculum development, Universidad Del Pacífico and the Fundación para el Desarrollo de la Cultura Empresarial started to work.

In 1997, after the favorable acceptance of the National Council of Universities and Polytechnic Schools (CONUEP), today the [[National Council of Superior Education]] ([http://www.conesup.net/  CONESUP]),&lt;ref name=CONESUP&gt;[http://www.conesup.net/info_universidades.php?id_univ=1044 Council of Universities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421114116/http://www.conesup.net/info_universidades.php?id_univ=1044 |date=21 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Congress of Ecuador|Ecuadorian National Congress]] passed Law # 43,&lt;ref&gt;Registro Oficial Organo del Gobierno del Ecuador;December 18, 1997; No. 218&lt;/ref&gt; creating Universidad Del Pacífico – Escuela de Negocios, a non-profit private institution, specialized in developing entrepreneurs and professionals, with an international model of higher education and authorized to grant degrees at an [[undergraduate]], and [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] level including continuous education, Masters and PhD levels.

Years of experience, the academic commitment of the founding business professionals of the university and its faculty resulted in the national and international recognition of the institution.

The university has three campuses at strategic development areas of the country&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[Quito]], [[Guayaquil]] and [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; with the purpose of reaching a national synergy and a contribution to the country's integration.

[[File:PatioDarSoulaimania.JPG|thumb|University of Ez-Zitouna]]
'''Ez-Zitouna University''' ({{lang-ar|جامعة الزيتونة}}, {{lang-fr|Université Zitouna}}) is in Montfleury, [[Tunis]]. It was first established in 737 and subsequently modernised in 1956. It consists of the Higher Institute of Theology and the Higher Institute of Islamic Civilisation in Tunis and a research institution, the Center of Islamic Studies, in [[Kairouan]]. 

==History==
For centuries, [[Kairouan|Qirwan]] was the early centre of learning and intellectual pursuits in Tunisia and [[North Africa]] in General. Starting from the 13th century, Tunis became the capital of [[Ifriqiya]] under [[Almohad]] and [[Hafsid]] rule.&lt;ref name="ref-23"&gt;{{Cite journal
  | first= Mary J. | last=Deeb | title=Ez-Zituna; op cit;
  | pages= 374}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This shift in power helped Ez-Zitouna to flourish and become one of the major centres of Islamic learning, and [[Ibn Khaldun]], the first social historian in history was one of its products.&lt;ref name="ref-24"&gt;{{cite journal
  | author = Charnay, Jean-Paul
  | title=Economy and Religion in the Works of Ibn Khaldun
  | journal = the Maghreb Review | volume = 4 #1 | pages=1–25
  | date = January–February 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The flourishing university attracted students and men of learning from all parts of the known world at the time. Along with [[theology]]; mainly the [[Qur'an]], the university taught [[jurisprudence]], [[history]], [[grammar]], [[science]] and [[medicine]].&lt;ref name="ref-23"/&gt; When it comes to books and libraries, Ez-Zituna libraries were the richest among North African counterparts. It had several collections totaling in the tens of thousands of books. One of its libraries, el-Abdaliyah included a large collection of rare and unique manuscripts.&lt;ref name="ox-ency"&gt;
{{cite encyclopaedia
  | title = Ez-Zituna
  | encyclopaedia = The Oxford Encyclopaedia of the Modern Islamic World
  | volume=4 | pages=374 | publisher = Oxford The oldest university in the world Press
  | year=1995 | author = M.J. Deeb | editor = J.L. Esposito}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts covered almost all subjects and sciences, including grammar, [[logic]], [[documentations]], etiquette of research, [[cosmology]], [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[minerals]], [[vocational training]], etc.&lt;ref name="hafez"&gt;
{{cite book
  | last = Abd el-Hafiz | first = Mansour
  | title = Fihris Makhtutat el-Maktaba al- Ahmadiya bi Tunis
  | publisher = Dar el-Fat'h | location = Beirut
  | year = 1969 | pages = 8&amp;ndash;9 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mosques-libraries"&gt;

  | title = Mosque Libraries : An Historical Study
  | publisher = Mansell Publishing Limited

&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the traditional pedagogy of the university opposed French influence in [[Culture of Tunisia|Tunisian culture]], even though younger people who studied there and who were unable to attend other universities lost the concept of the university having prestige. The students, faculty, and alumni became an integral part of the 1920s [[Destour]] party.&lt;ref&gt;Micaud 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Tunisian independence|Tunisia's Independence]], the modern Zitouna University was established on April 26, 1956. This was succeeded by the Zitouna Faculty of Shari’a and Theology on March 1, 1961 which became one of the components of Tunisian University. The Zitouna name was restored by [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] in 1987, after having been changed under [[Habib Bourguiba|Bourguiba]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Delaney, "New Tunis Chief Begins Democratic Changes," New York Times, December 13, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==

The present-day institution has some 1200 students and 90 faculty, divided between two associated institutes — the Higher Institute of Theology and the Higher Institute of Islamic Civiliation in Tunis — and a research institution, the Center of Islamic Studies ({{Lang-ar|مركز الدراسات الإسلامية بالقيروان}}) in [[Kairouan]].

Lessons in the Higher Institute of Theology began in the academic year 1988/89. It awards
# Bachelor's degree in Shari'a and Islamic thought in Islamic Sciences
# Master in Islamic Sciences 
# Ph.D. in Islamic Sciences 
# Superior Technician in Applied Multimedia on Islamic Arts

The Higher Institute of Islamic Civilisation has some 300 students and 40 researchers. It awards

The '''University of Wales Trinity Saint David''' ({{lang-cy|Prifysgol Cymru Y Drindod Dewi Sant}}) is a multi-campus [[university]] with three main [[campus]]es in [[South West Wales]], in [[Carmarthen]], [[Lampeter]] and [[Swansea]], a fourth campus in [[London]], England, and learning centres in [[Cardiff]], Wales, and [[Birmingham]], England.&lt;ref&gt;University of Wales Trinity Saint David (2010); ''Delivering a vision: The Creation of a New University''; Trinity Saint David Trust, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC News (2009): [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/8285902.stm ''£14.3m funding for new university'']; accessed 15 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uwtsd.ac.uk/campuses/|title=Campuses, Centres and Locations|publisher=UWTSD|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university came into existence through the merger of the two oldest [[higher education]] institutions in Wales, the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]] (UWL) and [[Trinity University College]] (TUC) in 2010, under Lampeter's royal charter of 1828. In 2011, it was announced that the [[University of Wales]] would also be merged into Trinity Saint David. On 1 August 2013 the university merged with [[Swansea Metropolitan University]].

The Patron of the university is the [[Prince of Wales]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uwtsd.ac.uk/history/|title=History and Timeline - University of Wales Trinity Saint David|last=UWTSD|first=Web Development Team -|website=www.uwtsd.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chancellor (education)#Wales|President]] of Trinity Saint David is [[R.

== History ==
{{further information|University of Wales, Lampeter#History|Trinity University College#History|Swansea Metropolitan University#History}}

The University of Wales Trinity Saint David was formed in July 2010 by the merger of the [[University of Wales, Lampeter]] and [[Trinity University College]], via a supplementary charter to Lampeter's 1828 royal charter.&lt;ref name="royal_seal_approval"&gt;BBC News Report (22 July 2009); [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-10723064 ''College merger sealed by royal charter'']. Retrieved 22 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education|QAA]] report on Lampeter concluded that, although the quality of the university's degrees was satisfactory, they had "''limited confidence''" in the institution's [[quality assurance]] procedures and systems.&lt;ref&gt;Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, May 2007; [http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/institutional/UoWLampeter/summary.asp ''University of Wales, Lampeter Institutional Review Summary''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325051824/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/institutional/UoWLampeter/summary.asp |date=25 March 2010 }}. Retrieved 16 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Further to this assessment, [[Higher Education Funding Council for Wales|HEFCW]] commissioned a further report which found "''very real problems of leadership and management''" at the university.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;Hodges, Lucy; The Independent Education (19 February 2009); [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/is-a-merger-the-only-way-to-save-lampeter-1625432.html ''Is a merger the only way to save Lampeter?: Strapped for cash and the subject of a highly critical review, Lampeter is in crisis''].

Retrieved 16 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
As a direct result, in December 2008, Lampeter announced that it was in merger talks with Trinity with the intention of forming a new university. This was formally announced in April 2009, when the institution's new name, ''University of Wales, Trinity Saint David'', was revealed. The university received its first students in September 2010. The name of the institution is a combination of Lampeter's original name (Saint David's College) and the name of Trinity University College.

In June 2010, a declaration of intent was announced between Trinity Saint David, [[Swansea Metropolitan University]] and three regional further education colleges ([[Coleg Ceredigion]], [[Pembrokeshire College|Coleg Sir Benfro]] and [[Coleg Sir Gâr]]) to establish a South-West Wales regional post-16 [[further education]] and [[higher education]] educational group.&lt;ref&gt;Press Releases (3 June 2010): [http://www.lamp.ac.uk/news/press_releases/2010/new-vision-to-transform-education.html ''A New Vision to Transform Education in South West Wales'']; University of Wales, Lampeter; accessed 5 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The FE colleges were to merge into one educational group, whilst the HE institutions would merge into another educational group, with both working closely within the region. 

In December 2010 it was announced that the university would merge with [[Swansea Metropolitan University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-12017883 |title=Swansea Metropolitan and Trinity Saint David to merge |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= 17 December 2010|accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This merger was completed on 1 August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/Uni-merger-goes-ahead-Met-dissolved/story-19511435-detail/story.html#axzz2ZnmhLKAE|title=Uni merger goes ahead after Met is dissolved|work=South Wales Evening Post|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 the university announced it would be establishing the [[Wales International Academy of Voice]] in Cardiff, opening in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{&gt;cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606021000/http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/news/pressreleases/name,7302,en.html|url=http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/news/pressreleases/name,7302,en.html|archive-date=6 June 2011|publisher=UWTSD|date=11 May 2011|title=The University and world leading operatic tenor Dennis O’Neill announces new Academy of Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, it was announced that the [[University of Wales]] would also be merged into Trinity Saint David.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-15410424 University of Wales effectively abolished in merger] – BBC News, 21 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-15157119|title=University of Wales to stop validating other degrees|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-15171830|title=University of Wales degree and visa scam exposed by BBC|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-15191954|title=Scrap University of Wales call by vice-chancellors|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Warning not to strip University of Wales assets|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-15689167|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A deed of union signed in 2017 functionally integrated the two universities, although the full constitutional merger has not been completed as of September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wales.ac.uk/en/AboutUs/About-Us-2018.aspx|title=About Us|publisher=University of Wales|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A London campus was opened in 2012.

== Campuses ==

=== Lampeter===
The Lampeter campus includes a number of academic, utility and residential buildings.

[[File:Uwlsdb.jpg|thumb|right|St David's Building]]
[[Charles Robert Cockerell]] designed the original college building, now called the Saint David's Building (informally known as Old Building or OB by students) in the centre of the grounds. It is a Grade II* [[listed building]] and contains lecture rooms,  administrative offices, student residential accommodation and the following three main areas:

The Old Hall was the college dining hall until the Lloyd Thomas refectory was opened in 1969. It then became part of the students' union, used as a venue for meetings and dances. After the opening of a new students' union building, it fell into disuse until 1991 when it was re-opened after much restoration; it is now used as one of the university's principal venues for meetings, dinners and conferences and is often hired out to outside organisations. It is also used for examinations and occasional lectures.

The Old Hall also contains paintings of various principals, presidents, benefactors, vice-chancellors ''et al.'' including the founder of the University Bishop [[Thomas Burgess (bishop)|Thomas Burgess]], [[Maurice Jones]], [[Thomas Price (Carnhuanawc)|Thomas Price]], [[Llewelyn Lewellin]], [[Edward Harold Browne]], [[Keith Robbins]] and [[Brian Morris, Baron Morris of Castle Morris|Brian Robert Morris]].

St David's Chapel was consecrated in 1827. In 1879, it was rebuilt according to the specifications of the architect [[Thomas Graham Jackson]] of Cambridge and re-opened on 24 June 1880. It was again refurbished during the 1930s, mainly through the provision of a new [[reredos]] (incorporating depictions of St David, Christ and [[St Deiniol]] in 1933 and a major overhaul of the organ in 1934. The chapel is provided with a dedicated chaplain and services are held here on Sundays and throughout the week as well as on saints' days and major festivals. These are generally well-attended by a mixture of staff, students and alumni.

[[File:Cantuwl.jpg|thumb|left|The original Canterbury Building (1887–1971)]]

The Founders' Library, named after its founders — [[Thomas Burgess (bishop)|Thomas Burgess]], [[Thomas Bowdler]] and [[Thomas Phillips (educational benefactor)|Thomas Phillips]] — was the College's library until the new library opened in 1966 and later housed the priceless collection of the university's oldest printed books (1470–1850) and manuscripts (the earliest being from the 13th century) unique to the university, given to St David's College from 1822 onwards, as well as the university's archives. 
In 2005, it was announced that a new £700,000 extension, The Roderic Bowen Library &amp; Archives, was to be built adjoining the Main Library to house the university's manuscripts, as the Founders' Library was not environmentally suitable for such valuable documents. This extension to the main library was completed and opened in 2008.

The former Founders' Library was subsequently refurbished and was reopened by HRH [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] to provide outside conference and seminar facilities.

==== Later additions ====
[[File:Cantuwl2.JPG|thumb|The second Canterbury Building (1973–2012).]]

''The Canterbury Building'' was built to house a growing number of students at the end of the 19th century. The foundation stone was laid by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1885 and the building was officially opened on 24 June 1887. It contained a physical science laboratory, two lecture rooms and new accommodation. However, structural problems forced the university to demolish the original building in the summer of 1971. The second Canterbury Building was opened on 20 October 1973 by the Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Kent]] and at various times housed the History, Classics, Foundation, Welsh and English departments.

The second Canterbury Building was demolished during 2012, and the third Canterbury Building, opened during the 2012/13 academic year, now houses the Student Services Hub.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/theuniversity/investing9millionpoundsinyouruniversity/developmentsonthelampetercampus/ "Developments on the Lampeter Campus"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Uni Library Lampeter.JPG|thumb|left|The Learning Resources Centre/Main Library entrance.]]
''The Library'' was opened on 7 July 1966 by the then Chancellor of the University of Wales, HRH [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. It was extended and then reopened by HRH [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] on 21 June 1984.

''The Arts Building'' was built to house the geography department and was opened by The Rt. Hon [[Peter Thomas, Baron Thomas of Gwydir|Peter Thomas]], [[Secretary of State for Wales]] on 4 October 1971. Currently, the Arts Building houses the School of Archaeology, History and Anthropology and the School of Management, VSS, IT, Business and Tourism as well as the Department of Philosophy.

[[File:Cliff Tucker Building.JPG|thumb|The Cliff Tucker Building]]
''The Cliff Tucker building'', on the banks of the [[River Dulas]], was opened by Sir [[Anthony Hopkins]] in 1996 on the site of the former archaeology practice trenches and incorporates several teaching rooms and a lecture theatre. It is named in honour of [[Cliff Tucker]], a former student and benefactor of the university.

[[File:Sheikh Khalifa Building.JPG|thumb|left|The Sheikh Khalifa building, in the town opposite the campus.]]
Completed in 1997 and named after Sheikh [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], a benefactor of the UWL, the ''Sheikh Khalifa building'' is the home of the School of Theology, Religious Studies and Islamic Studies, one of the largest Schools of its kind in the United Kingdom. It was opened by Professor Sir [[Stewart Sutherland, Baron Sutherland of Houndwood|Stewart Sutherland]]. Behind the departmental building is a small [[mosque]] and prayer room, used by Islamic students and residents of the town, and also the Rowland Williams Research building.

Opened in 2007, the ''Confucius Institute'' is the home of the university's department of Chinese Studies. The mission of the Confucius Institute has been to build bridges between Wales and China.

''The Roderic Bowen Library &amp; Archives'' were completed in 2007, adjoining the main library building. They are named after [[Roderic Bowen]], a former President of the university. The books, manuscripts and archives kept therein were formerly held in the St David's Building Founders’ Library. The library was opened on 17 October 2008 by the former [[First Minister for Wales]], [[Rhodri Morgan]].
It is a resource for teaching, research and scholarship within the university.

''The Students' Union'' houses the university's main entertainment venue, the Xtension, a bar, television and pool rooms, student shop and offices for union officials. It is the main focus of social life on campus, hosting club nights, socials, pool tournaments and charity events.

''The Bishop Burgess Hall'' formerly housed the Departments of Classics and Philosophy. In 2009 it was converted to become a hub for student services.

=== Carmarthen ===
[[File:Trinity College, Carmarthen Wales.jpg|thumb|right|Old College, Carmarthen]]

Although its foundation and indeed its speciality lies in education, the campus now also teaches a variety of degrees in subjects such as sport, health and nutrition, religious and Islamic studies, psychology, social inclusion, creative arts, photography, film and drama, business and tourism, and English and creative writing. The Carmarthen campus is the base of two of the university's three faculties.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/location/carmarthencampus/|title=Carmarthen Campus|author=Web Development Team – UWTSD|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus is centred around the original 1848 ''Old Building'' of Trinity College. It originally contained all of the original dormitories, common rooms, libraries, an original university quadrangle and teaching spaces.  The building today houses several lecture theatres and smaller classrooms often used by the university's School of Justice and Social Inclusion (including psychology) and theology, religious studies and Islamic studies.

[[File:Picture of Old Building Carmarthen.jpg|thumb|Old Building Carmarthen]]
Another feature of the old building of Carmarthen is the ''Archbishop Childs' Hall''. Named after [[Derrick Greenslade Childs]], who was [[Archbishop of Wales]], [[Bishop of Monmouth]] and director of the Church of Wales. Childs was principal of Trinity in 1965. The hall is of a classical shape and is hung with framed paintings of Childs. On the outside of the building, there is a carved crest of the Bishops of Wales.

''Cwad'' – The original 1848 quadrangle, what later became the old college library has been modified into the 'Cwad'. This operates in partnership with the main library.

[[File:Chapel at Trinity University College Carmarthen.JPG|thumb|Chapel building exterior]]
Attached to the main body of the Old Building is the ''University Chapel''. This was built in 1848 and although it has been modified slightly, still retains many original features. Attached to this is the historic ante-chapel, the original chapel the present one being an extension added in 1932, which is dedicated to past students and professors who served in the first world war. The ante-chapel contains a font and is decorated with student artwork. There is also the university chapel lounge which now houses the university's chaplaincy library and serves as a comfortable, relaxed meeting space for the Chapel community. This room also has a stained glass window installed in 2008 in memory of [[Norah Isaac]], former lecturer and pioneer of Welsh language education.

==== Later additions ====
The surrounding campus is a blend of modern buildings surrounded by sweeping lawns and gardens.

Opposite the old building is the ''Halliwell Centre'', named after a former principal of Trinity College, which is primarily used as a conference facility. Attached to the centre is the Merlin restaurant which is the campus' main restaurant and refectory for catered students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsd.ac.uk/en/halliwell/aboutthehalliwell/|title=University of Wales Trinity Saint David – Error 404: Page not found|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Halliwell Building, Trinity University College Carmarthen.jpg|thumb|left|Halliwell Building, Carmarthen]]

''The Carwyn James Building'' is a large four-storey building named after [[Carwyn James]], a former Welsh rugby player, teacher and lecturer at Trinity College. This facility is home to the Faculty of Education and Training.

''Emyr Wyn Jones Building''- This building contains office space, music suites and practice rooms for the School of Performing Arts. Adjoining this building was the School's main workshop for the degree of theatre production and design.

''The Dewi Building'' was originally built in 1925 as the Dewi Hostel. It was an extension of the original old college and served as an extra wing for student accommodation. An account of the conditions of the hostel survives from a student living in them at the time;
''“To keep oneself warm in the new wing during the Winter months was a problem for although it had a system of heating, the heat seldom reached even the second floor. To wash we depended on the rain-water caught in the roof of the building and this was always cold”.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/alumni/trinitycollegealumni/history/|title=University of Wales Trinity Saint David – Error 404: Page not found|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The main library'' of the university campus was constructed in 1995 to accommodate the growing diversity of subjects on the campus and is located opposite the Parry Block. It is dedicated to the poet [[Raymond Garlick]], who was a principal lecturer in Trinity's Welsh department.

''The Parry Building'', named after [[Canon Parry]] (a former principal of the college and psychology lecturer 1909–1940),&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/alumni/trinitycollegealumni/history/yourmemories/mrgeorgeheadmbe/|title=University of Wales Trinity Saint David – Error 404: Page not found|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502032529/http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/alumni/trinitycollegealumni/history/yourmemories/mrgeorgeheadmbe/|archive-date=2 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains a variety of teaching facilities used largely by the university's School of Creative Arts. These include fairly large classrooms and smaller art studios. The building runs parallel to the Norah Isaac building and the two are of very similar designs. Originally the front façade of the building, the oldest part, was the broadcast room in 1950.

''Students' Union'' – The students' union building was the centre of student social life on the campus. Constructed in 1972 it comprised two main venues: the Attic Bar which served food and drinks and downstairs 'Unity', the main entertainment venue of the Union. This facility hosted club nights as well as other social events. The Union incorporated many societies, ranging from sports such as rugby and hockey to historical societies.

''Norah Isaac Building'' – This building is home to the school of social justice and Inclusion and contains the reception for that school. It is named after [[Norah Isaac]], who was responsible for setting up the first ever Welsh drama department, and was a founder of the performing arts tradition at Trinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/news/newsarchives/trinityuniversitycollege/name,984,en.html|title=University of Wales Trinity Saint David – Error 404: Page not found|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a selection of classrooms and lecture suites.

The university was the first in the UK to place at its core sustainable development. The university's Institute of Sustainable Practice and Resource Effectiveness or INSPIRE is designed to ensure that students are prepared for their futures in the workplace and in society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/may/10/universityguide-uni-wales-lampeter | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801181810/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/may/10/universityguide-uni-wales-lampeter|archive-date=1 August 2013|location=London | work=The Guardian | title=University guide 2013: University of Wales, Trinity St David | date=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entry requirements===
With many of the degrees offered by the university there is less emphasis placed upon [[UCAS points]] and more upon individual merit especially regarding [[mature student]]s. However, for many of the degrees offered within the Faculty of Humanities a set number of UCAS points is required; for most courses this is usually between 240–280.

For postgraduate taught programs a minimum of an upper second class degree is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/postgraduate/howtoapply/|title=University of Wales Trinity Saint David – Error 404: Page not found|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
The university has continued the tradition of research in the humanities at Lampeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uwtsd.ac.uk/research/humanities-lampeter/|title=Humanities in Lampeter Research|publisher=UWTSD|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2014 [[Research Excellence Framework]] (REF2014), 47% of the university's research was judged as world leading (4*) or internationally excellent (3*).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uwtsd.ac.uk/news/press-releases/press-releases-2014/uwtsd-celebrates-ref-results.html|title=UWTSD Celebrates REF Results|date=18 December 2014|publisher=UWTSD|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university entered six units of assessment in REF2014, with 26% of research being judged 4* and 39% 3* in Modern Languages and Linguistics (jointly with the University of Wales's Centre for Advanced Celtic Studies), 23% 4* and 52% 3* in Art and Design: History Practice and Theory (jointly with the University of South Wales and Cardiff Metropolitan University as the Wales Institute for Research in Art and Design), 14% 4* and 48% 3* in Theology and Religious Studies, 9% 4* and 25% 3* in Geography, Environmental Studies and Archaeology, 4% 4* and 38% 3* in Classics, and 3% 3* in General Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://results.ref.ac.uk/Results/ByHei/185|title=University of Wales Trinity Saint David|publisher=REF2014|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student life ==

===Students' union===
[[File:TSDSULogo.png|thumb|Logo of the Trinity Saint David Students' Union]]
Students are represented by Trinity Saint David Students' Union ('''TSDSU''').&lt;ref name=TSDSU&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uwtsd.ac.uk/students-union/|title=Students' Union|publisher=UWTSD|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students union has buildings on all three main campuses, with bars in Carmarthen (Taphouse72) and Lampeter (Old Bar &amp; Xtention).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsdsu.co.uk/shop|title=Eat, Drink and Shop|publisher=TSDSU|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports ===
Both Lampeter and Carmarthen campuses have sports halls with [[badminton]] and [[Squash (sport)|squash]] courts, with a hockey team drawing from students of both campuses and a fencing team based on the St David's College campus which regularly competes in Welsh leagues and championships. Both campuses also have indoor climbing walls.

For outdoor sports, the university has [[tennis court]]s, a [[cricket]] field and facilities for football and rugby. The Carmarthen Campus also has an indoor swimming pool, an up-to-date gym and fitness suite and AstroTurf. There plans in motion to add gym facilities to Lampeter through the conversion of one of the squash courts.

The college cricket pavilion at Lampeter was opened officially on 1 May 1909 and is now a [[listed building]] in its own right.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==== Rugby ====
Rugby was introduced to the old St David's College by vice-principal [[Rowland Williams (theologian)|Rowland Williams]] around 1850 and, as such, the Lampeter campus can claim to have the oldest [[Rugby football]] team in Wales. Despite some debate as to whether this honour belongs to the town team or the university side, the Welsh Rugby Union's official history "Fields of Praise: The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union, 1881–1981"&lt;ref&gt;Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881–1981 pp259, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; indicates the college team as the first. However, [[Lampeter Town RFC]] were the representatives of Lampeter at the formation of the WRU in 1881.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

At Trinity, Rugby has long been an important part of college life. Indeed, a number of alumni went on to become outstanding international players including [[Sid Judd]], [[Ronnie Boon]], [[Dewi Bebb]] and [[Barry John]]. Wales and British Lions winger, [[Gerald Davies]], is a former student of both former universities.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The '''[[Webometrics]] Ranking of World Universities''', also known as '''Ranking Web of Universities''', is a ranking system for the world's universities based on a composite indicator that takes into account both the volume of the Web contents (number of web pages and files) and the visibility and impact of these web publications according to the number of external inlinks (site citations) they received.   The ranking is published by the [[Cybermetrics Lab]], a research group of the [[Spanish National Research Council]] (CSIC) located in Madrid.

The aim of the Ranking is to improve the presence of the [[academic]] and research [[institution]]s on the Web and to promote the [[open access (publishing)|open access]] publication of scientific results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/53631/in-the-know-webometrics-ranking-of-world-universities | title=In The Know: Webometrics Ranking of World Universities |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=6 September 2011 |accessdate=January 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ranking started in 2004 and is updated every January and July.  Today it provides Web indicators for more than 12,000 [[university|universities]] worldwide.

The&amp;nbsp;'''[[Webometrics&amp;nbsp;Ranking of Business Schools]]'''&amp;nbsp;is a similar ranking of the world's Business Schools.

==Objectives==
The Webometrics University Ranking is a ranking system based on university web presence, visibility and web access.&lt;ref name="bappi2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webometrics.info/en |title= Webometrics ranking |work=webometrics.info |accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ranking system measures how strongly a university is present in the web by its own web domain, sub-pages, rich files, scholarly articles etc.&lt;ref name="bappi2"/&gt; The central hypothesis of this approach is that web presence is a reliable indicator of the global performance and prestige of the universities and as such, is an indirect way to measure all the university missions (teaching, research, transfer). Although the Web is universally recognized as one of the most relevant tools for scholarly communication, it is still very rare these indicators are used for the evaluation of the scientific research and the academic performance of universities. Webometric indicators are provided to show the commitment of the institutions to Web publication.

A research paper in the peer-reviewed scientific journal ''Scientometrics'' found "reasonable similarities" between the Webometrics rankings and other prominent university rankings despite using a very different set of features to determine each university's rank. These similarities were increased when the comparison was limited solely to European universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.akademiai.com/content/k7403201200nv504/ |title=Comparing university rankings |publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó, co-published with Springer Science+Business Media B.V., Formerly Kluwer Academic Publishers B.V. |work=Scientometrics |date=February 23, 2010 |accessdate=January 19, 2012 |author=Aguillo|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Top universities are publishing millions of pages produced by dozens of departments and services, hundreds of research teams and thousands of scholars. Strong [[web presence]] informs of a wide variety of factors that are clearly correlated with the global quality of the institution: widespread availability of computer resources available, global internet literacy, policies promoting democracy and freedom of speech, competition for international visibility or support of open access initiatives, among others.

==Impact==
In [[Namibia]], the Webometrics list is frequently used in public interaction, particularly with respect to the country's two main state-funded institutions of tertiary education, the [[University of Namibia]] and the [[Polytechnic of Namibia]].&lt;ref name="Kiremire1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Enos Kiremire|title=African University Ranking Sub-Saharan Africa: (July 2009: University of Namibia)|newspaper=[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]]|url=http://www.newera.com.na/article.php?articleid=6323|date=21 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316095301/http://www.newera.com.na/article.php?articleid=6323|archivedate=16 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kiremire2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Enos Kiremire|title=Unam could move to top 10|newspaper=[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]]|url=http://www.newera.com.na/article.php?articleid=9932|date=12 March 2010|access-date=2010-11-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316095526/http://www.newera.com.na/article.php?articleid=9932#|archive-date=2012-03-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''West Coast University of Panama''' is a higher education provider based in [[Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newagebd.com/2007/apr/17/met.html#2 |title=UGC asked to sue West Coast University – Panama | newspaper=The Daily Newspaper |location=Dhaka |date=April 17, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205124055/http://www.newagebd.com/2007/apr/17/met.html |archivedate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/unaccredited.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525082240/http://www.osac.state.or.us/oda/unaccredited.aspx |title=Unaccredited colleges |publisher =[[Oregon Office of Degree Authorization]] |archivedate=May 25, 2011 |quote=This name ''[West Coast University]'' is used by multiple unaccredited entities. The extent to which they are related is unknown. All outside the U.S. are considered degree mills because they lack appropriate governmental authority to issue degrees. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
The "West Coast Institute of Management &amp; Technology (WCIMT)" was established in 1996 at [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] by a [[Christian]] family "S. Lloyd Family Trust" to provide vocational and Professional Educational Services at National and International Levels under a Christian mission and vision of preaching, teaching and Social work. It is an Autonomous Educational Institute and Vocational Training School.

The institute was a registered and accredited training institution, accredited by the [[Training Accreditation Council]] (TAC) of the [[Training Department of the Government of Western Australia]], and is listed on the "[[Commonwealth]] Register of Institutions and Courses" (CRICOS), which provide accredited courses to local and overseas students up to Graduate Diploma Level.

WCIMT established a chain of affiliated colleges in many countries. In 2004, the trustees decided to use this infrastructure to establish the West Coast University in a favorable country; on the recommendations of  faculty members West Coast University was incorporated at [[Panama City]], under article 19 of law 32 of 1927. The word "West Coast" does have an historical background in Panama. West Coast University, although based in Panama, serves as a global institute for autonomous higher education.

In March 2007 a [[Bangladesh]] online newspaper reported that the nation's education ministry and University Grants Commission had found that West Coast University was operating illegally in Bangladesh and the education ministry was seeking to [[lawsuit|sue]] the institution for offering bachelor's degree courses without government authorization. Government personnel said that in 2006 West Coast had opened a campus in [[Khulna]], where in February 2007 the school began conducting courses in electrical and electronic engineering, civil engineering, mechanical engineering and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newagebd.com/2007/apr/17/met.html#2 |title=UGC asked to sue West Coast University – Panama | newspaper=The Daily Newspaper |location=Dhaka |date=April 17, 2007 |author=Siddiqur Rahman Khan |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205124055/http://www.newagebd.com/2007/apr/17/met.html |archivedate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, an English-language online newspaper for Panama reported that West Coast University was advertising courses to be conducted there, but Panama's National Council of University Assessment and Accreditation (CONEAUPA) and Ministry of Education said the institution was not accredited and they had no record of the institution being legally established or having approved curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panama-guide.com/article.php/20120709094530352 |title=West Coast University of Panama Called Into Question |date=July 9, 2012 |author=Don Winner |work=Panama Guide |accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2012, West Coast University is a candidate for [[higher education accreditation|accreditation]] from the [[Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs]], for its bachelor's and graduate programs in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acbsp.org/p/cm/ld/fid=14|title=Current ACBSP Accredited Programs and Members|publisher=Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001185513/http://www.acbsp.org/p/cm/ld/fid%3D14|archivedate=2012-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2013 West Coast University is now accredited by the International Accreditation Organization (IAO). The IAO is not recognised by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Distributed Learning and Virtual Librarianship|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59158-906-8|page=284|author=Arne J Almquist|editor=Sharon G.

The Texas-based accreditor said its seal of approval is not to be claimed as a primary accreditation, which is how Cambridge Graduate is using it. [[George Gollin|[George] Gollin]] questioned relying on the accreditor in any capacity. He cited bogus degree providers on IAO’s list of accredited institutions, including one with ties to a known degree mill operator. ... Gollin notes that one of IAO’s fully accredited institutions is the University of Antarctica (motto: "Big Continent, Big Opportunities"), which the accreditor recently removed from its website. ... Accrediting the University of Antarctica should be a "one-strike-you’re-out disqualification," Gollin said. And any institution that "describes its couplings with IAO as a positive attribute is not to be taken seriously."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
