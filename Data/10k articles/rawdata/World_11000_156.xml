'''Ariel 1''' (also known as '''UK-1''' and '''S-55'''), was the first [[United Kingdom|British]] [[satellite]], and the first satellite in the [[Ariel programme]]. Its launch in 1962 made the United Kingdom the third country to operate a satellite, after the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]. It was constructed in both the UK and the [[United States]] by [[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]] and [[Science and Engineering Research Council|SERC]], under an agreement reached as the result of political discussions in 1959 and 1960.

== Development ==
[[File:Ariel 1 satellite, London Science Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Ariel 1 satellite, London Science Museum]]
In late 1959, the [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] proposed the development of Ariel 1 to NASA, following an offer made by the United States at a meeting of the [[Committee on Space Research]] to provide assistance to other countries with the development and launch of scientific spacecraft. By early the following year the two countries had decided upon terms for the programme's scope and which organisations would be responsible for which parts of the programme.

Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] named the satellite after [[Ariel (Shakespeare character)|the sprite in Shakespeare's ''The Tempest'']].&lt;ref name="ley196406" &gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction occurred at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. SERC provided the experiments, conducted operations, and later analysed and interpreted the results. Six experiments were carried aboard the satellite. Five of these examined the relationship between two types of [[solar radiation]] and changes in the Earth's [[ionosphere]]. They took advantage of techniques developed in the [[Skylark (rocket)|Skylark]] programme.

Ariel 1 was among several satellites inadvertently damaged or destroyed by the [[Starfish Prime]] [[high-altitude nuclear explosion|high-altitude nuclear test]] on July 9, 1962, and subsequent [[List of artificial radiation belts|radiation belt]]. It [[orbital decay|decayed]] from orbit on 24 April 1976.

A Health Policy and Planning article by Hardon (1990; 5: 186-189)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hardon A |title=Ten best readings in … the Bamako Initiative |journal=Health Policy Plan. |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=186–9 |year=1990 |doi=10.1093/heapol/5.2.186 |url=http://heapol.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/2/186.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the initiative as follows:
{{quote|text=The Bamako Initiative is a joint World Health Organization/ United Nations Children's Fund (WHO/UNICEF) Initiative aimed at solving the problems in the financing of primary health care in sub-Saharan Africa. It was launched in September 1987 at a regional WHO meeting, where Mr Grant, director of UNICEF, dealt with the severe economic crises facing sub-Saharan Africa, the negative effects of adjustment programmes on health, and the reluctance of donors to continue to fund recurrent costs of primary health care programmes. He outlined his vision of how primary health care could be revitalized by generating funds in communities through the sales of drugs at a price considerably higher than cost.

Following this speech, the African ministers of health present at the meeting adopted a resolution in which they called for the acceleration of primary health care by: 
* defining and implementing self-financing mechanisms at district level 
* encouraging social mobilization and 
* ensuring a regular supply of drugs. 
Positive experience with revolving drug funds was cited as a reason for the implementation of community financing mechanisms that rely on revenue out of the sales of drugs.}}

==Measures==
The Bamako Initiative proposed decentralising health decision making to local levels and establishing  realistic national drug policies to enhance the provision of essential drugs for Sub-Saharan Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Be Unlimited''' (also traded as '''Be There''' or simply '''BE''' and latterly known legally as '''Sky Home Communications Limited''') was an [[Internet service provider]] in the [[United Kingdom]] between 2004 and 2014. Initially founded as an independent company by Boris Ivanovic and Dana Tobak in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;https://hyperoptic.com/web/guest/the-team-&lt;/ref&gt; it was bought by Spanish group [[Telefónica Europe]] in 2006 before being sold on to [[BSkyB]] in March 2013 in an agreement which saw BSkyB buy the fixed telephone line and broadband business of Telefónica Europe which at the time traded under the [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]] and BE brands. The deal saw BSkyB agree to pay £180 million initially, followed by a further £20 million after all customers had been transferred to Sky's existing business. The sale was subject to regulatory approval in April 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BSkyB buys O2 and BE broadband businesses from Telefonica |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21627614 |newspaper=BBC News Online |date=1 March 2013 |accessdate=14 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently approved by the [[Office of Fair Trading]] on 16 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Completed acquisition by British Sky Broadcasting Limited of Be Unlimited |url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/mergers/Mergers_Cases/2013/BSkyB |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140402152426/http://www.oft.gov.uk/OFTwork/mergers/Mergers_Cases/2013/BSkyB |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 April 2014 |website=Office of Fair Trading |publisher=National Archives |accessdate=14 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BE offered [[ADSL2+]] broadband services through [[BT Group|BT's]] [[telephone exchange]]s via [[Local-loop unbundling|Local Loop Unbundling]] (LLU), with advertised speeds of up to 16 [[Data rate units|Mbit/s]] [[downstream (computer science)|downstream]] and 1.9 Mbit/s [[upstream (networking)|upstream]], subject to Annex M enablement, line length and quality,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bethere.co.uk BE Broadband - up to 16 meg broadband, unlimitedusage - www.bethere.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050829102218/http://www.bethere.co.uk/ |date=29 August 2005  }}&lt;/ref&gt; making BE's network the fastest mainstream, and first&lt;ref&gt;https://hyperoptic.com/web/guest/the-team-&lt;/ref&gt; ADSL2+ ISP in Britain during its nine-year existence. Although BE's services were initially only available in selected parts of [[London]], [[Manchester]] and [[Birmingham]], it underwent a programme of rapid expansion across the UK making it available in at least 1,256 of the UK's telephone exchanges by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samknows.com/broadband/llu/be SamKnows.com: BE Broadband LLU information page].Retrieved 14 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samknows.com/broadband/llu-operator/be SamKnows.com - BE's unbundledexchanges, retrieved 8 December 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet access was unlimited and offered uncapped [[bandwidth management|bandwidth usage]] subject to compliance with one of the industry's more lenient [[Acceptable use policy|Fair Usage policies]]. Uncapped services are currently quite unusual from UK-based [[Internet service provider|ISPs]] due to the high cost of backhaul over BT's core backhaul network (BE used an independent [[Level3 Communications|Level3]]/[[Global Crossing|GlobalCrossing]] backhaul, peering primarily at [[London Internet Exchange|
LINX]]).&lt;ref&gt;[url=http://www.choose.net/media/guide/features/broadband-fair-use-policies.html title= UK fair use policyguide]&lt;/ref&gt; BE did not stipulate monthly bandwidth usage restrictions in its small print, however it was known to take action against a number of users due to dramatically excessive usage where other customers' access was affected. Such action was reported to include disconnecting customers on congested exchange who consumed over one [[terabyte]] of data in a month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2013/02/isp-be-broadband-face-unlimited-questions-after-user-cut-off-for-overuse.html ISPReview BE Broadband Face Unlimited Questions After User Cut Off for Overuse]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.beusergroup.co.uk/?id=926  Be Usergroup: Customer removed from BE for overuse.]&lt;/ref&gt; This was in line with its policy which stated that it would take action against users whose usage is '...so excessive that other members are detrimentally affected' at its discretion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121223082447/https://www.bethere.co.uk/fairusage.do BE's Fair and Acceptable UsagePolicy]&lt;/ref&gt;

To receive BE broadband, customers were required to have an active and compatible [[telephone line]]s provided by either BE, a service which it offered from 2010, or [[BT Wholesale]] reseller such as BT or the Post Office's Home Phone service. [[Local-loop unbundling#United Kingdom|Fully unbundled]] telephone lines from companies such as [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]] or [[BSkyB|Sky]] were not compatible.

The majority of users who were 500 metres or less from their local telephone exchanges were expected to achieve connection speeds close to the advertised maximum; with Annex M and interleaving disabled ('fastpath') on a 300-metre loop length, a sync speed of 24 [[Data rate units|Mbit/s]] [[downstream (computer science)|downstream]] and 2.5 Mbit/s [[upstream (networking)|upstream]] was easily achievable.

==Platform and technical information==

BE's service utilised ADSL2+ ([[G.992.5|ITU G.992.5]]) and was one of the few UK ISPs to offer the [[ITU G.992.5 Annex M|Annex M]] extension to increase upload speeds anywhere up to the full technical maximum of ~2 Mbit/s for its ''BE Pro'' customers. The end user's router communicated with the telephone exchange using [[Ethernet]] over [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] (ETHoA, [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1483 RFC 1483]).

One of BE's advertised claims was that it did not carry out [[traffic shaping]] in any way and that traffic was only limited by available bandwidth and by any congestion at the local exchange. BE did, however, block SMTP traffic over [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port]] 25 to and from external destinations for users with dynamic IP addresses in order to prevent its dynamic [[Address pool|IP pool]] being [[blacklist (computing)|blacklisted]]. The result was that a user with a dynamic IP address could only use BE's own SMTP server or one configured to use non-standard ports for sending email. Users who wished to host their own mail server were required to subscribe to a service with a static IP address.

On 15 October 2007 [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]], also owned by parent company Telefónica Europe, launched its own broadband product delivered over the BE network infrastructure. In effect, this resulted in two broadband companies delivering services over a platform on which previously only one company was operating. This, coupled with the fact that there were officially over three times the number of subscribers using the platform since the launch of O2Broadband,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.o2.com/media_files/financial_performance/Q4_2007_FINAL.pdf O2 plc Q4 2007 results] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107193230/http://www.o2.com/media_files/financial_performance/Q4_2007_FINAL.pdf |date=7 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; caused some BE users to voice concerns over the future performance, stability and contention of the service. Such concerns were generally groundless as BE upgraded its network capacity to accommodate new customers.&lt;ref&gt;BE's userforums at www.bethere.co.uk - access is only available to BE users&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wholesale Network Access===
In addition to the BE and O2 brands being delivered over the same network, since 10 March 2008, BE/O2 resold [http://www.bewholesale.co.uk/ wholesale access] to its network to other providers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkbroadband.com/news/3455-vaioni-launch-20mbps-business-dsl-product.html ThinkBroadband news story]&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these companies was Vaioni,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vaioni.com/ultra20 Vaioni corporate website - Ultra 20 productpages] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416164006/http://www.vaioni.com/ultra20 |date=16 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which launched an "up to 20 Mbit/s business class ADSL2+ service" featuring up to 2.5 Mbit/s upstream and a guaranteed 10:1 contention ratio with prices starting from £140.99 per month. Vaioni's product, branded 'Ultra 20', was aimed at small to medium-sized businesses and schools.

In August 2009 the UK ISP [[Andrews &amp; Arnold]] entered into an agreement to use BE's core and LLU networks to augment BT's legacy 20CN and [[21CN]] infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aaisp.net.uk/broadband-BE.html AAISP BE Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091510/http://aaisp.net.uk/broadband-BE.html |date=25 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time that BE was sold to BSkyB in 2013 many other business connectivity providers offered BE wholesale services; a list of them is available [http://beusergroup.co.uk/technotes/index.php?title=Resellers on the official BE Usergroup wiki].

===Network Upgrades===
On 6 October 2011, BE announced an overhaul of its core network to increase bandwidth, prepare for a transition to [[IPv6]] and improve network resiliency. During this time customers with static and dynamic IP addresses were assigned new addresses; BE took the approach of rebuilding its entire network, migrating customers, changing IP address blocks and incurring a small one-off period of downtime during an end user's migration. This migration was implemented in phases with a transitional period with both old and new network settings operating concurrently.

BE also changed its methods of assigning static IP addresses, selling netblocks of one, six and fourteen as opposed to the old system of a group of addresses from a pool of arbitrarily available IPs. Customers were planned to be migrated over a six to eight months period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.bethere.co.uk/2011/10/changes-were-making-to-bes-network.html Changes we’re making to BE’s Network | BE Broadband] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010000134/http://blog.bethere.co.uk/2011/10/changes-were-making-to-bes-network.html |date=10 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FTTC==
In late June 2011, BE's managing director Chris Stening announced a fibre optic service to directly compete with BT Infinity. This service would also utilise FTTC technology, one of the new generation [[Fiber to the x|Fibre to the ''X'']] technologies, with speeds and pricing yet to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.bethere.co.uk/ BE's blog]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bethere.co.uk/web/beportal/fibre BE Fibre Pre-registration Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928130036/https://www.bethere.co.uk/web/beportal/fibre |date=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BE updated customers on their progress in September 2011; but whilst receiving 'thousands' of pre-registrations, as of late 2011 they had yet to partner with a suitable company operating a national fibre network to allow them to offer the level of service desired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.bethere.co.uk/2011/09/update-on-fibre.html An update on fibre | BE Broadband&lt;!-- Bot generatedtitle --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001021131/http://blog.bethere.co.uk/2011/09/update-on-fibre.html |date=1 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2011, BE customers who pre-registered for fibre received an email informing them of a single-exchange trial. BE would install its own equipment in BT's Barking exchange, as there were sufficient BE users in the area and FTTC was readily available via [[Openreach]]. A shortlist of 25 people was to be gathered, from which an initial 10 testers would be secured. They would then submit regular feedback over a period of up to six months, sharing their experiences publicly via the BE Blog. The new service was specified as using Openreach GEA (Generic Ethernet Access), allowing data from BT to be transferred to BE's [[Digital subscriber line access multiplexer|DSLAM]] equipment instead of routing it to a Point of Presence (PoP) via BT's core network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beusergroup.co.uk/?id=799/ FTTC TrialQ&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://beusergroup.co.uk/index.php?id=798 BE Fibre Trial Email]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2012, only staff and a small number of customers on a single exchange had participated in limited trials and in April 2012 BE announced that it was unlikely to launch a fibre product in 2012 but hoped to do so on a limited basis at an unspecified future date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.bethere.co.uk/2012/04/update-on-fibre.html Statement on FibreRollout 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412223651/http://blog.bethere.co.uk/2012/04/update-on-fibre.html |date=12 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
After the sale of BE to BSkyB in March 2013, BSkyB announced that the BE and O2 networks were to close and that customers would be migrated over to the existing [[Sky Broadband]] service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beusergroup.co.uk/index.php?id=949 BE ForumTalk To Sky Results]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beusergroup.co.uk/index.php?id=962]&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the closure of BE's email and website hosting services, the discontinuation of line bonding, multiple static IPs and Annex M as well as the closure of the BE/O2 Wholesale network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beusergroup.co.uk/index.php?id=974 Be Usergroup - Wholesale Closing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.beusergroup.co.uk/index.php?id=986 Be Usergroup - Sky Close Email and Web hosting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beusergroup.co.uk/index.php?id=946]&lt;/ref&gt; Users were also gifted their existing loaned Be-Boxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beusergroup.co.uk/index.php?id=944 Be Usergroup - Free BeBoxes]&lt;/ref&gt; Many users however had concerns with becoming Sky customers and decided to leave rather than migrate. To try and accommodate some of their concerns Sky worked to integrate both static IP addresses and control over line profiles into their own network and launched this new service as 'Sky Broadband Unlimited Pro'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sky.com/shop/your-move-to-sky/broadband-pro/ Sky Broadband Pro]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Central Public Library of Serres''' is a public library located in [[Serres]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Greece]]. It was founded in 1952. It is administered by the [[Ministry of Education, Religious Affairs, Culture and Sports (Greece)|Ministry of Education, Religion, Culture and Sports]]. The core of its collection has been provided by the Ministry of education, the National Library, the French Embassy, the Ministry of external affairs and with donations from the friends of the library. In our days, the enrichment of the collection is mainly made through orders.

Since 2006, the Central Public Library of Serres is hosted in its new 5 store building of 3.200 square meters, which provides reading rooms, [[book storage]] facilities, a children's library, a conference and meeting room, a multimedia room and other creativity spaces.

The collection of the Central Library includes 83.000 volumes and its members have reached the 26.000. All books have been processed electronically with the ABEKT 5.6 integrated library system of the [[National Documentation Centre (Greece)|National Documentation Centre]]. There is also a collection of digitised books and historical material that can by accessed through an online database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.serrelib.gr/serrelib/ Digital Library of Serres]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central Public Library of Serres also has a mobile library, to serve citizens from the prefecture of Serres.

The '''FIRST project''' is an '''FP7 Support Action''' intended to foster cooperation in the area of Internet technologies between Europe and Latin America FIRST focuses primarily on five countries: [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]] and [[Mexico]]. The project intends to extend the constituency of '''[[European Technology Platform]]s (ETPs)''' to strategic [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s from the different sectors included in the field of '''Future Internet''' (FI): networks, contents and services, ICT Components and systems.

The European [[research community]] in each area is structured into several ''''European Technology Platforms''' (ETP) led by relevant industry stakeholders. The full list of related ETPs is as follows:

'''FIRST''' used this structure of ETPs to classify Latin American stakeholders, and the evaluation of potential areas for [[cooperation]] between Europe and Latin America. This structure was used during the launch of the Latin American Technology Platforms (LATPs). Using the European ETPs model for LATPs facilitated the establishment of liaisons, the identification of counterparts and the identification of common interests.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5794">The '''European League for Economic Cooperation''' or '''ELEC''' ({{lang-fr|Ligue Européenne de Coopération Economique}}, LECE) is an independent political [[advocacy group]] which advocates for closer [[European integration]].

Established in 1946, ELEC was one of the founding members of the [[European Movement]] in 1948. It is built as a federation of national sections present in a number of European countries. The membership of its national sections is drawn largely from economic and financial circles; but it also maintains close contacts with senior national and European civil servants as well as academics and policy makers, whose expertise and influence stimulate the exchanges and broaden their scope and quality.

ELEC has advisory status at the [[Council of Europe]] and on the [[United Nations]] Economic Commission for [[Europe]].

==History==
The European League for Economic Cooperation was founded in 1946 by [[Paul Van Zeeland]] ([[Belgium]]), [[Józef Retinger]] ([[Poland]]) and [[Pieter Kerstens]] ([[the Netherlands]]). They were rapidly joined by other people such as [[Edmond Giscard d'Estaing]] ([[France]]), Harold Butler ([[United Kingdom]]) and [[Hermann Abs]] ([[Germany]]).

It has never been a mass movement, although it was present at [[The Hague]] in 1948 among the founding organisations of the [[European Movement]].

Open to all ELEC members, there are several working commissions covering various areas of economic activity and cooperation in Europe such as Economic &amp; Social, Mediterranean and Monetary. It is in the commissions that ELEC's essential research is carried out, as well as the drafting of position papers that give rise to various publications. They frequently call on external experts to present the issues which they examine. The Monetary and the Mediterranean commissions organize from time to time conferences, which are open to a larger public, including non-ELEC members.

The "Kronberg Monetary Conference" is ELEC's flagship in this respect. From the very first years of its existence, ELEC showed a keen interest for the monetary aspects of European integration which remained unabated ever since. On 14 July 1956, the Monetary Commission  convened for the first time in the Schlosshotel in Kronberg (north of Frankfurt), at Deutsche Bank's invitation and under Hermann J. Abs' presidency, in order to examine the monetary conditions of the common market. It was the first in a long series of yearly gatherings at this same location, stretching almost without interruption for more than half a century. Off the record, prestigious speakers of big European banks, central bank governors, European commissioners and high officials, influential members of the European Parliament, and members of the board of the European Central Bank shared their thoughts with ELEC members, leading to animated discussions. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet in person was a regular guest of the “Kronberg" meetings.

After 2007, other important European banks took over as a host of this gathering that is still called the “Kronberg” Conference. ING Group hosted a conference on March 5 and 6, 2009, in Amsterdam, and once again on November 13, 2011, in The Hague. Rabo Bank is set to sponsor the next conference.

==Organisation==

First and foremost, ELEC hinges on its national sections, which enjoy considerable autonomy in recruiting their members, assembling their financial resources and organising their own activities. It is mainly through national sections that members are attracted to ELEC and participate in its national and international activities.

The Central Council, which is ELEC's managing body, brings together twice a year the presidents of national sections in activity and individual members elected for their personal contribution to ELEC, under the leadership of the International President. It alone is empowered to adopt resolutions in ELEC's name and to circulate them by whatever means it chooses. This is also the forum in which the programmes of ELEC's working commissions are debated and approved, and their work evaluated.

Open to all ELEC members, there are several commissions covering various areas of economic activity and cooperation in Europe of which the most important are : Economic &amp; Social, Mediterranean and Monetary. It is in the commissions that ELEC's essential research is carried out, as well as the drafting of position papers that give rise to various publications. They frequently call on external experts to present the issues which they examine.
 
ELEC is financed through yearly contributions of the national sections.

Western-style '''fast food in ([[Mainland China|mainland area]])''' is a recent phenomenon. [[McDonald's]] opened its first outlet in [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] in January 1984 before opening franchises in the mainland [[China|People's Republic of China]] in 1990. In October 1987, [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], still the most popular fast food chain in China, established its first restaurant in the [[China|People's Republic of China]] ([[Mainland China|mainland area]]), located in [[Beijing]]. KFC was later followed by McDonald's, which remains China's number two foreign fast food option.&lt;ref name="armstrong.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armstrong.edu/Initiatives/history_journal/history_journal_west_meets_east_kfc_and_its_success_in_china |title=West Meets East: KFC and Its Success in China |work=armstrong.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423045238/http://www.armstrong.edu/Initiatives/history_journal/history_journal_west_meets_east_kfc_and_its_success_in_china |archivedate=2014-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to American style fast food, China has many local options, including a slew of restaurants that attempt to imitate fast food, particularly KFC.&lt;ref name="armstrong.edu"/&gt;

==History==
Fast food has become widely popular in the 33 years since it was introduced to China. [[Pizza Hut]] and [[McDonald's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26226387/ns/business-cnbc_tv/t/mcdonalds-has-big-appetite-china/#.UtZvX_RDu6w|title=McDonald's has a big appetite for China|work=msnbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; both entered the country in September and October 1984 respectively, only three years after KFC entered in 1987. The first McDonald's in [[Shenzhen]] was supplied from [[Hong Kong]] from 1990 to 1992 but by the time the first McDonald's in Beijing opened in 1992 Mainland China had proper infrastructure to supply the restaurants.

There are now 4,200 KFCs in 850 Chinese cities (as of 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-16/kfc-loses-its-touch-in-china-its-biggest-overseas-market|title=KFC Loses Its Touch in China, Its Biggest Overseas Market|author=Liza Lin, Leslie Patton|work=Businessweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pizza Hut has over 1,300 stores in China.&lt;ref name="Chan Zakkour 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yu 2012 p. 51"/&gt; Many Chinese fast food restaurants in the style of Western chains have popped up as well.

== Franchises ==

=== Kentucky Fried Chicken ===
[[File:KenDeJiFastEatShop.JPG|thumb|A Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in China]]

==== Establishments in Beijing ====
KFC experienced extreme success in China, breaking several world records for restaurants in its early years. KFC's first establishment in Beijing opened doors in November 1987 as the world's largest fast-food restaurant with five-hundred seats. In 1988 it fried 2,200 chickens daily and earned more than any other KFC location with a turnover of 14 million yuan. KFC opened 28 restaurants across China in 1994, with 7 of them being located in Beijing.

==== Children as a Target Audience ====
KFC quickly found that it appealed strongly to children. Chinese parents reported that they had no preference for any particular fast food restaurant and simply let their children choose. As a result, KFC worked harder to figure out how to appeal to the kids even further. One of the first things KFC found was that children were not at all interested in its logo. In 1995, the bearded, elderly white man that Chinese children found so off-putting was exchanged for a playful cartoon character dubbed 'Chicky.' Other efforts to entice children included play areas, child-height sinks, smaller furniture, and settings for birthday parties, which are a very recent phenomenon in China.

==== Competition with local Chinese fried-chicken restaurants ====
The KFC in Dongsi sits across the street from a Chinese fried-chicken restaurant called "Glorious China Chicken." Despite Glorious China Chicken's cheaper prices, larger portions, choices of rice, soup, and vegetables, and draft beer, the KFC consistently had more customers because of one factor: its cleanliness. Regardless of the amount of people being served, the Chinese KFC employees were constantly cleaning the restaurant and its bathrooms and surpassed the vast majority of China's local restaurants in terms of cleanliness. As a result, Chinese people highly favored KFC and began to complain of other restaurant's lack of bathrooms and general untidiness.

=== McDonald's ===
[[File:Xi'an McDonald's near Drum Tower.JPG|thumb|A McDonald's restaurant in [[Xi'an]]]]

==== First McDonald's in China ====
In January 1984, the first Chinese McDonald's ever opened in Taipei, Taiwan located in the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]].

==== Establishments in Beijing ====
The first McDonald's opened in mainland China in 1990 in the [[Shenzhen Special Economic Zone]]. More prominently, the largest McDonald's in the world opened on April 23, 1992 in [[Beijing]]. It had 700 seats, 29 cash registers, and served over 40,000 on its opening day. By 1996, 29 restaurants had opened in Beijing alone. Initially, mainly affluent families ate there to distinguish themselves and as a result McDonald's became a symbol of a new lifestyle of seeking out foreign cultural influences. One of the biggest reasons McDonald's has experienced more success than other fast food restaurants in China is its high standards of hygiene. Beijing media consistently praises McDonald's cleanliness and frames it against the poor cleanliness of its competitors.

== Chinese fast-food restaurants vs American fast food ==
One reason that Chinese fast-food companies have not been successful in China is that Chinese food in general is already fast and convenient by nature. Chinese people are already used to fast, cheap food, but the exotic nature of American food makes it somewhat more desirable. The second major reason is that China has almost no food regulations and as a result many Chinese restaurants are fairly unsanitary, especially when compared to American fast food restaurants. McDonald's and KFC establishments in China have placed a massive emphasis on cleanliness to the point that they would choose them in a heartbeat over any Chinese fast-food counterpart.

– Source: &lt;ref&gt;French, P. (2013). In search of Mickey Li's: why doesn't China have its own fast-food mega-chain? ''Foreign Policy'', (201), 31+. Retrieved from http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=temple_main&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA337368821&amp;asid=c53a06f64ed3f90936690bc6bfa998f7&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of coupons has also played a major role in American fast-food success over Chinese chains. While McDonald's and Kentucky's prices are not any cheaper than those of Chinese chains, coupons made their food much more affordable for poor people and increasing brand recognition. By spreading coupons around and advertising cheaper deals to Chinese locals, McDonald's and KFC made themselves immediately noticeable to almost every person in urban Chinese settings.

– Source: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2003.09.007 |title=Effects of coupons on brand categorization and choice of fast foods in China |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=674–86 |year=2005 |last1=Laroche |first1=Michel |last2=Kalamas |first2=Maria |last3=Huang |first3=Qinchao }}&lt;/ref&gt;

KFC employed an extended menu that contained Chinese food in addition to the food that its American counterparts sell. By doing this it was able to nearly match the items Chinese fast-food restaurants sell while putting an Americanized spin on it that readily drew in Chinese locals. The sheer speed at which KFC expanded also played a major role in its success over Chinese fast food chains. By opening restaurants extremely quickly and strategically placing them in major cities, it overshadowed beginning Chinese chains before they had the chance to develop.

== The spread of  fast food in China ==

=== First Phase: Establishing anchor points (1994-2000) ===
In the beginning of their businesses in China, McDonald's and KFC represented the elites of western culture to the Chinese locals. This was because McDonald's and KFC established their first restaurants in high-end shopping centers, office areas, and near universities.

=== Second Phase: Commercial centers and transport hubs (2001-2005) ===
As McDonald's and KFC extended their reach to commercial centers and transportation hubs and began to appeal more to pop culture, they extended their reach to young, white-collar and trendy demographics and the fast food enterprises began to appear less foreign to Chinese locals.

=== Third Phase: Daily zones (2006-2012) ===
The final phase of the spread of fast food in China occurred when McDonald's and KFC stopped targeting universities and urban hot-spots and began expanding outward and focusing on residential areas. McDonald's and KFC also incorporated more Chinese flavors into their food and reduced American symbolism in their restaurants, making their restaurants seem even less foreign to Chinese locals. With this, eating at American fast food restaurants ceased being something Chinese families did on special occasions and became routine for them.

== Health impacts ==

=== Correlation between fast food and rising obesity before 2006 ===
A 2005 study by the [[The Obesity Society|Obesity Society]] has found that country-wide, fast-food had not yet spread far enough across China to have resulted in significant rises in obesity. Chinese children generally ate very few meals away from home. While children in urban areas did eat more fast food than those in rural areas, the difference was considerably small. It is important to note that this study was performed in 2005, before the Third Phase of fast food's spread in China occurred in which McDonald's and KFC began marketing heavily toward children and extending their outreach.

– Source: &lt;ref&gt;Adair, L. S. (2005). ''Obesity research: Are child eating patterns being transformed globally?'' North American Association for the Study of Obesity.
&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by the [[International Journal of Pediatric Obesity]] between April and October 2004 compared [[Body mass index|BMI]] to fast-food consumption in Chinese children between the ages of 2 and 18 and found that the highest correlation between the two occurred between the ages of 10 and 12. Despite this, they were unable to find very much correlation between fast food and obesity and concluded that increased obesity was largely a result of environment and lifestyle.

=== Correlation between fast food and rising obesity after 2012 ===
Due to a lack of study on the subject, a 2016 journal by [[Elsevier]] uses a theory-based approach to assess the effects of fast food on Chinese obesity among youth. While Chinese children statically consume less fast food than American children, Chinese children are becoming increasingly obese and it is likely that the influx of fast food in China is a contributing factor even though it might not be the principle culprit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Of those who frequent Chinese fast food institutions the most, the vast majority do so in groups as a social activity. Fast food restaurants are also a hot-spot for birthday parties or hosting social events, furthering this idea of a fast food being primarily a social activity.&lt;ref&gt;Yan, Yunxiang 2000. Of Hamburger and Social Space: Consuming McDonald's in Beijing. In ''The Consumer Revolution in Urban China'', ed. Deborah S. Davis, pp. 201-25. Berkeley: University of California Press. Copyright 1999 The Regents of the University of California. Reprinted with permission of the Regents of the University of California and the University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; From this, it is reasonable to suppose that the Chinese do not necessarily consume fast food because of the convenience and cheap prices that entice Americans. This idea of fast-food restaurants as an exotic social destination draws youth away from Chinese restaurants, coupled with the increased amount of fast-food restaurants near transport hubs, could very well be negatively impacting their health.

==Characteristics==
McDonald's in China is generally fairly similar in menu and taste to how it is in the US, but Pizza Hut is considered upscale in China &lt;ref&gt;http://thestudyabroadblog.com/study-abroad-experiences/{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and KFC offers many locally popular dishes such as fishball soup.

== Synopsis ==
''From A Whisper'' is based on the real events surrounding the 7 August bomb attacks on the US Embassy in [[Nairobi]] in 1998. Abu is an intelligence officer who keeps to himself. When he meets Tamani, a young, rebellious artist in search of her mother, he decides to help. The discovery of her death churns up memories of Fareed, Abu’s best friend who also lost his life in the attack. The discovery forces them to learn how to forgive, to believe in themselves, and confront what they fear the most – the truth.&lt;ref name=fcat/&gt;

'''''Getroud met rugby''''' is a [[South Africa]]n television series which premiered on [[kykNET]] on 7 April 2009. It was marketed as an [[Afrikaans]]-language version of the British television show ''[[Footballers' Wives]]''; the title literally translates to English as ''Married To Rugby''. The series is one of the most watched drama-series on KykNET. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Summary==
''Getroud met rugby'' is a drama revolving around four stars of a Johannesburg [[Rugby football|rugby]] team and their wives as they become involved in various interconnected scandals.

==Production==
''Getroud met Rugby'' was developed by Deon Opperman with his wife, actress Hanli Rolfes-Opperman, who is also part of the main cast. Most of the actors on the show are well-respected Afrikaans actors. Cast members [[Ivan Botha]] and [[Altus Theart]] appeared in the film ''[[Bakgat (film)|Bakgat]]'' in 2008 in which rugby was also the integral plot point.

The series was shot on location in [[Johannesburg]] and [[Krugersdorp, Gauteng|Krugersdorp]] on a schedule divided into two segments, the first from 29 September – 20 December 2008, and the second from March to May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gfo.co.za/live/content.php?Item_ID=634&lt;/ref&gt; The crew utilized Sony EX3 High Definition cameras. Post-production was handled by [[The Film Factory]], a post-production house in Johannesburg.

==Hiatus==
From the end of 2010 to March 2012 the show was on a hiatus due to the filming of the movie ''Getroud met Rugby: Die Onvertelde Storie''. Filming resumed in March 2012.

KykNET announced on 15 October 2009, that ''Getroud met Rugby'' had been renewed for a second season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teeveetee.blogspot.com/2009/10/breaking-renewed-getroud-met-rugby-will.html|title=BREAKING. Renewed - Getroud met Rugby will kick off with a 2nd season.|date=2009-10-15|website=TV with Thinus|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Season 4 premiered on 17 July 2012. 

==Soap==

'''Greece''' and the '''Philippines''' established its bilateral, diplomatic and trade relation in 1947. Greece has an embassy in [[Manila]] and the Philippines has an embassy in [[Athens]].

==Economic relations==

The Greek city of [[Thessaloniki]] are open to enhancing business ties with the Philippines. Thessaloniki located in northern Greece, is the country’s second major economic, industrial, commercial and political center, and a major transportation hub for the rest of southeastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://business.inquirer.net/73743/greece-local-execs-open-to-enhancing-business-ties-with-ph | title= Greece local execs open to enhancing business ties with PH | work= Inquirer Business | date= 27 July 2012 | accessdate= 23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration==

According to official Greek statistics, there were 5,000 Filipinos in Greece in 1991, which declined to 2,000 by 1996. In reality, there were many more [[illegal immigrant|working in the country illegally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Iosifides|King|1999|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dole.gov.ph/news/details.asp?id=N000000739 |periodical=DOLE News |title=Imson urges Greece-based OFWs to take advantage of new legalization rules |date=2004-06-13 |accessdate=2009-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123092632/http://www.dole.gov.ph/news/details.asp?id=N000000739 |archivedate=2016-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine community have set up a school for their children in downtown [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cañete|2004|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large proportion are women (81% in 1999), who generally find employment as [[domestic worker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Iosifides|King|1999|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 there were 30,000 Filipinos in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.athenspe.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=2 |title=Filipino Community |publisher=Philippine Embassy in Athens, Greece and Cyprus |accessdate=2009-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617034146/http://www.athenspe.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=2 |archivedate=2009-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Halmahera naked-backed fruit bat''' (''Dobsonia crenulata'') is a common and widespread species of [[megabat]] in the family [[Pteropodidae]]. It is [[endemic]] to [[Indonesia]].

==Distribution==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Non-Moluccan populations apparently represent an undescribed subspecies (K. Helgen pers. comm.). The species is found in Indonesia, in northern [[Molucca Islands]], [[Halmahera Island]], [[Togian Islands]], [[Sangihe Islands]], [[Talaud Islands]], [[Penang]], and [[Sulawesi]] and other Indonesian islands (Muno, Buton, Pelang, Kabaena, Mangole, Sanana, Halmahera, Siau, Sangihe, Karekelang, and also Hoga Island).&lt;br&gt;It is commonly found in gardens and disturbed forest (Flannery 1995). It is not dependent on water. It roosts in caves, trees, and rock crevices. This species lives in large colonies. Births probably take place in December (Flannery 1995)."&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''International Baby Food Action Network''', IBFAN, consists of public interest groups working around the world to reduce infant and young child morbidity and mortality. IBFAN aims to improve the health and well-being of babies and young children, their mothers and their families through the protection, promotion and support of [[breastfeeding]] and optimal infant feeding practices. IBFAN works for universal and full implementation of the [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]] and Resolutions.

In 1998 IBFAN received the [[Right Livelihood Award]]. The RLA Jury has honoured IBFAN “for its committed and effective campaigning over nearly twenty years for the rights of mothers to choose to breastfeed their babies, in the full knowledge of the health benefits of breastmilk, and free from the commercial pressure and misinformation with which companies promote breastmilk substitutes.” 

IBFAN's principles are:
 
#The right of infants everywhere to have the highest level of [[health]].
#The right of families, and in particular women and children, to have enough nutritious food.
#The right of women to breastfeed and to make informed choices about infant feeding.
#The right of women to full support for successful breastfeeding and for sound infant feeding practices.
#The right of all people to [[health care|health services]] which meet basic needs.
#The right of health workers and consumers to [[health care system]]s which are free of commercial pressures.
#The right of people to organise in international solidarity to secure changes which protect and promote basic health.

'''"Lady, Lady"''' ({{IPA-es|ˈleiði, ˈleiði}}) was the [[Spain|Spanish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984]], performed in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] by  the quartet [[Bravo (Spanish group)|Bravo]].

The song is a melancholy mid-tempo ballad, with lead singer Amaya Saizar telling the story of the titular ''"Lady"'', a woman who lost her loved one ''"and her youth a thousand years ago"'', yet every evening she waits patiently for his return. The ''"Lady"'', in ''"her grey sun hat, her starch dress"'', her ''"Jasmine perfume"'' and ''"blue eye make-up"'' wastes her life waiting and lives ''"in her crystal world"''.

The song was performed fourth on the night (following [[France]]'s [[Annick Thoumazeau]] with "[[Autant d'amoureux que d'étoiles]]" and preceding [[Norway]]'s [[Dollie de Luxe]] with "[[Lenge Leve Livet]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 106 points, placing 3rd in a field of 19.

The song was a great commercial success in Spain, reaching number one at the ''[[Los 40 Principales]]'' playlist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://los40.com/lista40/cuando_naciste/19840617 Los 40 Principales - NÚMERO 1 DE 16/06/1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was succeeded as [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spanish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985 Contest]] by [[Paloma San Basilio]] with "[[La fiesta terminó]]".

==Background==
The [[Liechtenstein general election, 2013|previous elections]] in 2013 saw the [[Patriotic Union (Liechtenstein)|Patriotic Union]] lose five seats and their majority in the Landtag. The [[Progressive Citizens' Party]] also lost a seat, but became the governing party in part due to the entry of [[The Independents (Liechtenstein)|The Independents]], a new party that won four seats.

The 2013 elections marked the first time that four parties had won seats in the Landtag,&lt;ref name="France24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130203/new-independent-party-rattles-liechtenstein-vote|title=New Independent party rattles Liechtenstein vote|date=3 February 2013|publisher=Global Post|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with suggestions that protest voting against austerity policies or reduced partisanship amongst voters may have been factors.&lt;ref name="France24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="APwire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/02/03/politics-in-tiny-liechtenstein-shaken-up-by-surprise-election-success.html|title=Politics in tiny Liechtenstein shaken up by surprise election success of independents|date=3 February 2013|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vaterland1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaterland.li/index.cfm?source=lv&amp;id=21918|title=Mehrheit der Stimmzettel wurden angepasst|date=4 February 2013|publisher=Vaterland|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oskar Kallis. Linda kivi kandmas. 1917.jpg|thumb|"Linda Carrying a Rock," by [[Oskar Kallis]]. 1917.]]
In the [[Estonian mythology]] and [[Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald|Kreutzwald's]] epic ''[[Kalevipoeg]]'', '''Linda''' was the mother of [[Kalevipoeg]] and the wife of [[Kalev (mythology)|Kalev]].

She has given the name to several Estonian locations, including the ''Lindakivi'' (Linda boulder) in [[Lake Ülemiste]]. According to the epic myth "[[Kalevipoeg]]", her son, the title character, named the Estonian fortress settlement at the location of modern [[Tallinn]] in her honor - ''Lindanise'' (approximate translation: Linda's [[nipple]] or [[bosom]]).

The '''[[Liptako]]–[[Gourma]] Authority''' ('''LGA''') is a regional organization seeking to develop the contiguous areas of [[Mali]], [[Burkina Faso]], and [[Niger]].

Created in December 1970, the Authority has as its goal the promotion of the areas mineral, energy, hydraulic, and agricultural resources within a regional framework.  The zone covered by the authority corresponds to the border regions of the three countries, and covers an area of 370,000&amp;nbsp;km², including 19 provinces of Burkina Faso, 4 administrative regions of Mali, and two departments and an urban community of Niger.

This zone is composed entirely of the semi-arid [[Sahel]] region. The dominant economic activity is agriculture and livestock herding, but the zone has considerable energy, hydraulic, and mining potential.

==History==
The sixth conference of the heads of state took place in [[Gao]] on April 25 and 26, 2005, with Burkina's president [[Blaise Compaoré]] acting as president of the Authority.  The next conference is scheduled to take place in 2006 in [[Tillabery]], Niger.

===Joint military task force===
On 24 January 2017, the three states agreed to form a joint task force to combat insecurity and terrorism in the region, to be headquartered in [[Niamey]], with rotating leadership to represent all three nations. The move was modeled on the establishment of a multi-national force in 2015 by [[Chad]], [[Cameroon]], Niger and [[Nigeria]] to oppose [[Boko Haram]] in the [[Lake Chad basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Liptako-Gourma: new joint task force|website=[[West Africa Brief]]|date=6 February 2017|url=http://www.west-africa-brief.org/content/en/liptako-gourma-new-joint-task-force|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meteņi''' ({{IPA-lv|met̪eɲi|}}) or '''Metenis'''  is an ancient [[Latvians|Latvian]] [[spring (season)|spring]] waiting holiday, that ends on [[Ash Wednesday]], which is followed by [[Lent]]. Meteņi is celebrated in February or early March, seven weeks before [[Lieldienas]].

== Origins ==

The Meteņi celebration preserved the ancient traditions of [[New Year's Eve]], because ancient Indo-European people celebrated New Year's Eve in mid-February. This came from the early Latvian word "meti", which meant turn of time, gauge. The original meaning is preserved in the word "laikmets" (era). Lithuanian word "metai" even now means "year".

== Name in other languages ==

In [[Livonians|Livonian]] populated regions and Riga, this celebration is known as [[Fastelavn]] (possibly originating from German ''Fastnacht'' - hunger night). Elsewhere, it is also called Lastavāgs, Aizgavēnis, Miesmetis, Buduļi Eve, and Pie Day. [[Lithuanians]] call it ''[[užgavėnės]]'', while [[Estonians]] call it ''vastlapäev''. To [[Russians]] and other [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christian]] peoples this festival is known as [[Maslenitsa]] ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Масленица'', ''[[Belorussian language|Belorussian]]'': масьленіца, ''[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]'': масниця).

Elsewhere in Europe and America, this festival coincides with the carnival time and referred to as Shrove Tuesday ([[French language|French]]: ''Mardi Gras'', [[German language|German]]: ''Fastnachtsdienstag'', [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Martedì grasso'', [[English language|English]]: ''Shrove Tuesday'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexilogos.com/calendrier_carnaval.htm&lt;/ref&gt;) or "''Pancake Day''".&lt;ref&gt;http://tradic.ija.lv/meteni/&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin countries, it is called ''carnival'', ''carnaval'' or "meat balls", and it is the holiday of overeating, after which comes Lent. It is also has a connection with [[Roman Empire]]'s time to celebrate traditions of ''[[April Fools' Day]]'' on April 1. During it happens a mask parade (''masquerade''), all sorts of performances, and immoderate blowout and drinking. To bid a farewell to Winter, they burned a year-old allegorical serpent or dragon, straw dolls, and logs, whose ashes are spread across the land so that the New Year would be fruitful.

== Holiday traditions ==

Meteņi is about people eating and drinking as much as they wanted. During this time [[domestic pig|pigs]] were slaughtered, so the traditional holiday dishes were pig's head and fritters. Parents threw gifts to their children from above the room, as if [[Laima]] threw her gifts from above the heaven. As with every winter holiday, [[ķekatas]] were traveling the country and paid visits to people. There is a belief that the longer Meteņi is celebrated, the better the harvest is expected following summer. The Solstice bonfire is burned, while performing rituals of tying a witch's tongue and donations. The campfire is used to burn last summer's [[Jāņi]] festive wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eliesma.lv/meteni-ir-klat&lt;/ref&gt; The straw is often burned and in some places the straws are handmade into characters, which is primarily removed from hills and then burned to drive winter away.&lt;ref&gt;http://dziveszinazaltis.blogspot.fr/2013/06/uguns-gadskartu-ritualos.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2017 Gianna Nannini - by 2eight - DSC3677.jpg|thumb|Italian singer Gianna Nannini was 56 years old when she gave birth in 2010]]'''Pregnancy over age 50''' has, over recent years, become possible for more [[woman|women]], and more easily achieved for many, due to recent advances in [[assisted reproductive technology]], in particular [[egg donor|egg donation]]. Typically, a woman's [[fecundity]] ends with [[menopause]], which by definition is 12 consecutive months without having had any menstrual flow at all. During [[perimenopause]], the menstrual cycle and the periods become irregular and eventually stop altogether, but even when periods are still regular, the egg quality of women in their forties is lower than in younger women, making the likelihood of conceiving a healthy baby also reduced, particularly after age 42.&lt;ref&gt;Advanced Fertility Center of Chicago, Female Age, Fertility and Infertility [http://www.advancedfertility.com/age.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note, that the female biological clock can vary greatly from woman to woman. A woman's individual level of fertility can be tested through a variety of methods.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.essentialparent.com/lesson/fertility-tests-for-women-1747/&lt;/ref&gt;

Men also experience a decline in fertility as they age though in a very gradual and later process in contrast to women's fertility as men's biological clock declines simply by each age (loses 1 percent every age) in comparison to women's biological clock where it begins drop sharply and rapidly after 38 years of age; for example, the average time to pregnancy if a man is under 25 is just over 4.5 months but nearly two years if a man is over 40 (if the woman is under 25).&lt;ref&gt;A man’s age matters https://yourfertility.org.au/for-men/age/&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of genetic defects is greatly increased due to the [[paternal age effect]]. Children with fathers aged 40 or older are more than five times as likely to have an autism spectrum disorder than children fathered by men aged under 30.&lt;ref name="yourfertility.org.au"&gt;https://yourfertility.org.au/for-men/age/&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers estimate that compared to a male fathering a child in his early 20s, there is double the chance of the child getting schizophrenia when the father is age 40, and triple the risk of schizophrenia when the father is age 50 (though, for most people this means the risk goes from approximately 1 in 121 when a man is 29, to 1 in 47 when a man is age 50 to 54).&lt;ref&gt;http://schizophrenia.com/prevention/older.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Men's fertility declines throughout the lifespan, with the volume and fecundity of a man’s semen quality and sperm motility (the ability of sperm to move towards an egg) decrease continually between the ages of 20 and 80.&lt;ref name="yourfertility.org.au"/&gt; The incidence of dwarfism&lt;ref&gt;https://www.llnl.gov/news/study-shows-genetic-quality-sperm-deteriorates-men-age&lt;/ref&gt; and miscarriage also increases as men age &lt;ref name="yourfertility.org.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929275-500-mens-sperm-quality-decreases-at-age-35/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], between 1997 and 1999, 539 births were reported among mothers over age 50 (four per 100,000 births), with 194 being over 55.&lt;ref name="salihu"&gt;Salihu, Hamisu M., Shumpert, M.

Retrieved March 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest mother to date to conceive, was 71 years, and the [[List of youngest birth mothers|youngest mother]], 5 years old. According to statistics from the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]], in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] more than 20 babies are born to women over age 50 per year through [[in-vitro fertilization]] with the use of donor oocytes (eggs).&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Sarah.

== Medical considerations ==
The risk of [[pregnancy]] complications increases as the mother's age increases. Risks associated with childbearing over the age of 50 include an increased incidence of [[gestational diabetes]], [[hypertension]], delivery by [[caesarean section]], [[miscarriage]], [[preeclampsia]], and [[placenta previa]].&lt;ref name="salihu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="james"&gt;Schienberg, Jonathan.

Retrieved March 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=April 2018}}  In comparison to mothers between 20 and 29 years of age, mothers over 50 are at almost three times the risk of [[Birth weight|low birth weight]], [[premature birth]], and extremely premature birth; their risk of extremely low birth weight, small size for [[gestational age]], and [[perinatal mortality|fetal mortality]] was almost double.&lt;ref&gt;Lister Hill Center for Health Policy.

| Aggie Ezekiel of [[Edmonton]], Alberta, already a mother of three adult daughters with her husband Johnny Ezekiel, gave birth in August 2010 to her own granddaughter Clare At the age of 50 years and 9 months. She chose to act as a surrogate mother for her daughter, Tinna (age 28), who happened to be born without a uterus and had one of her ovaries removed at the age of 21. Aggie had been premenopausal for two years and could not produce the child herself, so she had to undergo fertilization hormone to boost her menstrual cycles so that the matrix can accommodate two to seven eggs retrieved by her daughter and fertilized in vitro with the sperm from her daughter's partner, Wilson Brown. One of the two implanted embryos happened to appear in a lateral position in Aggie's uterus as a result of which she conceived her granddaughter through caesarean section. The girl weighed 8.69&amp;nbsp;lb (3.94&amp;nbsp;kg) and did not breath on her own. As a result, she was placed on an oxygen machine for an hour to clear her lungs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmontonjournal.com/health/gives+daughter+ultimate+gift+motherhood+itself/8369562/story.html Mom gives her daughter the ultimate gift — motherhood itself] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608065623/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/health/gives+daughter+ultimate+gift+motherhood+itself/8369562/story.html |date=2013-06-08 }}.

| A 57-year-old Korean (born in 1955), nicknamed "Park", gave birth by caesarean section performed at 36 weeks, to two girls, fraternal twins, weighing, respectively, 2.230&amp;nbsp;kg and 2.630&amp;nbsp;kg, on September 26, 2012, at the Obstetric Asan Medical Center, at [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. After 27 years to try unsuccessfully to conceive naturally with her husband, because of the obstruction of her fallopian tubes, the menopause had occurred when she was 45 years old, twelve years before. She therefore had to resort to IVF with donated oocytes, fertilized by the sperm of her 60-year-old husband.&lt;ref name=oldmomskorea /&gt;

It is against the law in France for post-menopausal women to receive IVF so she went to the USA for treatment. The case caused some ethical debate because the two eggs donated to Jeanine by a Californian woman were inseminated with sperm from Jeanine's brother, Robert: one was brought to term by Jeanine, the other by the donor as surogate, who will give birth the week after, on May 22, 2001, to Marie-Cécile, her biological daughter promised to Jeanine. Their doctor was not informed that Jeanine and Robert were sister and brother; he thought that they were a married couple.

| Rosanna Della Corte of [[Canino]], [[Italy]] gave birth to a son, Riccardo, on July 18, 1994, at the age of 62.  After their first son was killed when a car crashed into his motorcycle in 1991, Rosanna Della Corte and her husband, Mauro, decided to attempt to have a second child. The couple tried to adopt, but were unable to, as under Italian law an adoptive parent could be no more than 40 years older than their potential child. Mauro read in the newspaper about an Italian doctor, [[Severino Antinori]], who had helped a woman in her late 50s have a child. With Dr. Antinori's help, the Della Cortes conceived through IVF with oocytes donation and Mauro's sperm. Rosanna, 60, became pregnant on the first attempt, but [[miscarriage|miscarried]] after 40 days, and it took 6 more attempts before there was success. She was then just 62.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio, Frances. (July 22, 1997).

== Debate ==
Pregnancies among older women have been a subject of controversy and debate. Some argue against motherhood late in life on the basis of the health risks involved, or out of concern that an older mother might not be able to give proper care for a child as she ages, while others contend that having a child is a fundamental right and that it is commitment to a child's wellbeing, not the parents' ages, that matters.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wiki.edu-research.info/infertile Motherhood At Mid-Life—A Medical and Ethical Dilema] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130929223342/http://wiki.edu-research.info/infertile |date=2013-09-29 }}."

In the 1990s, [[France]] approved a bill which prohibited postmenopausal pregnancy, which the French Minister of Health at the time, [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], said was "...immoral as well as dangerous to the health of mother and child". In [[Italy]], the Association of Medical Practitioners and Dentists prevented its members from providing women aged 50 and over with fertility treatment. [[UK|Britain's]] then-[[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Virginia Bottomley]], stated, "Women do not have the right to have a child; the child has a right to a suitable home".&lt;ref name="hinman" /&gt; However, in 2005, age restrictions on IVF in the United Kingdom were officially withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Louise. (November 3, 2005). "[http://news.scotsman.com/health.cfm?id=2186242005 Couples any age to be allowed to apply for fertility treatment]." ''The Scotsman.'' Retrieved March 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal restrictions are only one of the barriers confronting women seeking IVF, as many fertility clinics and hospitals set age limits of their own.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost" /&gt;

'''Reunification of Gran Colombia''' refers to the potential future reunification of [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Panama]] under a single government. There have been attempts of reunification since 1903, when [[Panama]] separated from Colombia. People in favor for a reunification are called ''"unionistas"'' or unionists. In 2008, The Bolivarian News Agency reported that the then-president of Venezuela, [[Hugo Chávez]], announced the proposal of the political restoration of the [[Gran Colombia]], under the Bolivarian revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consulvenemontreal.org/rep/boletin/Boletin_Consulado_13_01.pdf |format=PDF |title=Boletin Informativo No. 13 |publisher=Consulvenemontreal.org |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
Some commentators believe that a reunified Gran Colombia could become a global economic powerhouse. That would contrast with Gran Colombia in the 1820s, whose economy was mostly agrarian and had little industry.&lt;ref&gt;Guhl, Ernesto (1991). «Capítulo XII: División Política de la Gran Colombia». Las fronteras políticas y los límites naturales. Fondo Fen Colombia, Bogotá.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gran Colombia would have the world's 14th largest economy behind South Korea and the 12th largest population behind Mexico. By 2050, Gran Colombia would have nearly 150 million citizens. Gran Colombia would also be the world's 10th largest nation by size.

The '''Roman Catholic Diocese of Bjelovar-Križevci''' ({{lang-hr|Bjelovarsko-križevačka biskupija}}; {{lang-la|Dioecesis Bellovariensis-Crisiensis}}) is a [[diocese]] in the [[Ecclesiastical province]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb|Zagreb]] in [[Croatia]]. On December 5, 2009 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] erected the Diocese of Bjelovar-Križevci with territory taken from the [[Archdiocese]] of [[Zagreb]]. On the same day the [[Pope]] erected the new [[Diocese of Sisak]], also in Croatia and within the Ecclesiastical province of Zagreb.

The see of the diocese is in the city of [[Bjelovar]], where the [[Cathedral]] of [[Saint Teresa of Avila]] is situated. The diocesan co-cathedral of the Holy Cross is in the city of [[Križevci, Croatia|Križevci]].

The ''{{lang|en|'''Silver Arrow'''}}'' ({{lang-fr|'''Flèche d’Argent'''}}) was an [[intermodal passenger transport]] service linking [[London Victoria station|Victoria station]] in [[London]] with [[Gare du Nord]] in [[Paris]], via [[Le Touquet – Côte d'Opale Airport|Le Touquet Airport]], northern France.  In operation between 1956 and the opening of the [[Channel Tunnel]], it used a combination of rail and air transport, and, for some of its existence, also buses.{{sfn|Smith|2015|page=47}}

'''World Heritage Memory Net''' ('''WHMNet'''), a partnership project with [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Centre]], is a global [[digital library]] of cultural, historical, and heritage multimedia collections related to the current 962 UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s of 157 State Parties. Of these 962 sites, 745 are cultural sites, 188 natural, and 29 mixed and 38 of the total 962 are in danger.&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list| World Heritage List&lt;/ref&gt;  WHMNet was officially launched April 29, 2011,&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/740/ World Heritage Memory Net Launched&lt;/ref&gt; and can be thought of as “the world’s heritage at your fingertips.”&lt;ref&gt;http://gslis.simmons.edu/podcasts/podcast_extras/2009/BetaPhiMu_20090417.pdf Chen, Ching-chih. (2009). World Heritage Memory Net. [PowerPoint slides]. Retrieved from http://gslis.simmons.edu/podcasts/index.php?id=114&lt;/ref&gt;

The guiding conceptual principle for the development of the World Heritage Memory Net is to construct a framework that allows users to easily see, explore, discover, and visually experience the 936 Heritage Sites first, and then dig in for more detailed and descriptive information about each Site, as graphically shown on the home page.  It is directed by [[Ching-chih Chen]], currently of [http://globalcc.org/ccc.html Global Connection and Collaboration], a nonprofit and tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization; prior to July 2010, Chen directed this project for three years at Simmons College until she became Professor Emeritus.

The goal of WHMNet is to provide an online library of material related to the 962 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and to provide universal access to a worldwide audience. WHMNet provides multimedia and multilingual content and retrieval, videos, timeline, map, as well as links to major resources, such as [[Online Computer Library Center|OCLC]], [[Wikipedia]], [[Internet Archive]], [[Million Books]], [[Google Scholar]] and [[Google Book Search|Google Books]].

All of the collections are available in at least 6 official UN languages: [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. As of 2012, up to 103 languages are supported by WHMNet, as available.

==History==

Directed by [[Ching-chih Chen]] of the US nonprofit and tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization, [http://www.globalcc.org Global Connection and Collaboration, Inc.], and supported until August 2010 by the NSF/International Digital Library Program (IDLP) as a part of her [[Global Memory Net]], WHMNet is the result of a multi-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in November 2006 between the World Heritage Centre and [[Simmons College (Massachusetts)|Simmons College]], Boston, Massachusetts, USA under the leadership of Chen, who was then information technology Professor at Simmons Graduate School of Library and Information Science.  The WHMNet project, which began in July 2007, benefits greatly from Chen's GMNet, an online global image library and gateway to cultural, historical, and heritage images around the world, created with a multi-year grant from the International Digital Library Programme of the US [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation (NSF)]]. WHMNet leverages GMNet's innovative integrated multimedia content retrieval system (i-M-C-S) with further system development.  Chen became Professor Emeritus of Simmons College in June, 2010 and NSF grant ended in August 2010.  Since September 2010 to the present, WHMNet has been supported by GlobalCC until its completion.

The goal is to bring an immersive, seamless, multimedia experience in a multilingual website to citizens, researchers, scholars and students of the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/326 World Heritage Memory Net is coming soon!&lt;/ref&gt; The former World Heritage Centre Director and current UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Culture, Francesco Bandarin, has stated that the project offers "great potential to enhance the humanities for universal access and enrichment through the use of emerging technologies."&lt;ref name="unesco" /&gt; It exposes the world's cultural, natural, and mixed wonders as well as educates global citizens to the dangers of losing these properties through war and environmental factors. It also serves to better promote intercultural understanding during this troubled time.

==Collections==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Taj Mahal on World Heritage Memory Net.jpg|thumb]] --&gt;WHMNet is a fast, efficient, cutting-edge, online knowledge base which provides universal access to multilingual, multimedia and multiformat resources from museums, archives, libraries, and world bibliographic and Web resources, and includes photographs, videos, 360° Panophotographies, audio clips, and documents. Currently the WHMNet Collection has more than 40,000 images, 27 video tours, many more video documentaries from available sources, and access to more than 250 360° Panophotographies courtesy of Tito Dupret of [http://patrimonium-mundi.org patrimonium-mundi.org].  Detailed descriptive information is presented in multilingual format in at least 6 UNESCO official languages (Arabic Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish) and in many additional languages when available.  In total, 103 world languages are represented.

Multilingual multimedia collections of the 936 UNESCO World Heritage Sites are accessible by:

* Geographical regions - such as Africa, Asia, Europe, etc.
* Within each region by country or areas
* Within each country or area, alphabetically by the name of the World Heritage Site
