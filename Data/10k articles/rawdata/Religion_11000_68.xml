Pastor '''Alan Campbell''' (7 August 1949 – 11 June 2017)&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/loyalist-pastor-alan-campbell-condemned-for-racist-and-sectarian-views-dies-at-67-35827750.html  Loyalist pastor Alan Campbell condemned for racist and sectarian views dies at 67]  '' Belfast Telegraph'' 15 June 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;    was the [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] [[pastor]] of the Restored Open Bible Ministries in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], director of Restored Open Bible Ministries  and a scholar and lecturer in the [[British Israelism]] movement. Campbell was popular in [[Historicism#Biblical historicism|Historicist]] circles because of his Reformed theology in the identification of the [[Papacy]] as the [[Antichrist]] of [[Bible prophecy|Biblical prophecy]].

==Brief biography==
Alan Campbell was born in Belfast on 7 August 1949 into a staunchly [[Presbyterianism in Ireland|Presbyterian]] home, in a [[Roman Catholic]] area.  His grandmother was a very firm adherent of the doctrine of  British Israelism, and thus he was exposed to this teaching from a very early age.  Despite his upbringing, however, he did not [[Religious conversion|convert]] to [[Christianity]] until 19 September 1965, in the Ravenhill Free Presbyterian Church after listening to a sermon by [[Ian Paisley]].

Because of his "Kingdom Identity" views (which hold that [[Israel]], not the church, is the bride of [[Jesus|Christ]], in contradiction to the teachings of the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]]) and his acceptance of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] beliefs, Campbell left the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]] and no longer promoted Ian Paisley and his literature.

Campbell began preaching in May 1974, and preached his first sermon on Bible prophecy on 24 September 1978. He was officially ordained to the ministry by Dr Francis Thomas on 18 July 1988. He graduated from the [[University of London]] with a bachelor's degree in history, and from the [[Queen's University of Belfast]] with a Certificate in [[Biblical Studies]]. He held the post of head of [[religious studies]] at [[Newtownabbey]] Community High School near Belfast where he was subject to at least one Ministry of Education inspection because of  concerns about his teaching methods.  He held fiercely [[anti-Catholic]] views (referring to Catholics as worshipping a "wafer God"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jul/09/northernireland.comment|title=The poison at the heart of the Orange Order|date=8 July 2000|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=1 August 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and used his website to disseminate these sentiments.  He was the  author of a number of Bible study books, and  lectured throughout the United Kingdom, the United States, [[Canada]], and Australia although his ministry centred in [[Ulster]], and many of his messages dealt with the [[Politics of Northern Ireland|political situation]] there. Campbell had contact with the [[Christian Assemblies International]]. 

Campbell opposed [[miscegenation]]. In a lecture in the USA, he stated that the [[white race]] is superior and that [[black people]] are the "beasts of the field" referred to in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWByMeGaolE|title=YouTube|website=Youtube.com|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He supported [[apartheid]] in South Africa, was critical of [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] politicians meeting [[Nelson Mandela]] and called [[Desmond Tutu]] a 'little black man'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/controversial-pastor-alan-campbell-dies-aged-67-1-8010792 "Controversial pastor Alan Campbell dies aged 67"] The Newsletter, 15 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church closure==
The Sunday Life reported in December 2013, that Campbell's church had closed. Speaking to Sunday Life about the closure, Campbell said he had been seriously ill earlier that year.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Life'', 22 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh''' ([[translation]]: ''Indian Workers' Union'')  is one of the [[trade union]] organization in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1091017/jsp/frontpage/story_11626260.jsp|title=RSS outfits grow, away from politics
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Dattopant Thengadi]] on 23 July 1955.

The BMS itself claims to have more than 10 million members. According to provisional statistics from the Ministry of Labour, the BMS had a membership of 6,215,797 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labourfile.org/superAdmin/Document/113/table%201.pdf] [https://web.archive.org/web/20110409191235/http://www.labourfile.org/superAdmin/Document/113/table%201.pdf archive]&lt;/ref&gt; The BMS is not affiliated to any International Trade Union Confederation. It is the labour wing of [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/141205/nation-current-affairs/article/rss-backed-union-joins-trade-stir-against-nda-government%E2%80%99s|title=RSS-backed union joins trade stir against NDA government’s 'anti-worker' labour laws amendments}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{unsourced section|date=November 2016}}
BMS was founded on 23 July 1955 – the day being the birth anniversary of Lok Manya Bal Gangadhar Tilak – veteran of Freedom Movement. Two important aspects stand out in connection with this:
 
(a)	
Formation of BMS was not the result of split in the existing trade union organisations, unlike in the case of almost all other trade unions. Hence it had the formidable responsibility of building its organisational structure from the grass root level. It started from zero having no trade union, no membership, no activist (karyakarta), no office and no fund.
(b)	
On the very first day it was visualised as a trade union whose base-sheet anchors – would be Nationalism, would work as a genuine trade union, keeping itself scrupulously away from party politics. This was also unlike other trade unions which were linked to one or the other political party, overtly or otherwise.

==Aims And Objectives==
{{unsourced section|date=November 2016}}
The aims and objectives of BMS are:
 
(a)	
To establish ultimately the Bharatiya order of society in which they shall be secured among other things:
 	
i.	Complete utilisation of manpower and resources leading to full employment and maximum production.
ii.	Replacement of profit motive by service motive and establishment of economic democracy resulting in equitable distribution of wealth to the best advantage of all individual citizens and of the national as a whole.
iii.	Development of autonomous industrial communities forming part and parcel of the nation, culminating in ‘Labourisation of industry’
iv.	Provision of work with living wage to every individual through maximum industrialisation of the nation.
(b)	
With a view to enable the workers to strive successfully for the ultimate realisation of the above objects and to strengthen them, in the meanwhile, to make their own contribution to the cause of protecting and promoting their interest consistent with those of the community:
 	
v.	
To assist workers in organising themselves in trade unions as a medium of service to the motherland irrespective of faiths and political affinities.
vi.	
To guide, direct, supervise and coordinate the activities of the affiliated unions.
vii.	
To assist the affiliated unions in the formation of state BMS units and Industrial Federations as constituent units of the BMS and
viii.	
To bring about unity in the trade union movement.
(c)	To secure and preserve work for the workers:
 	
ix.	
The right to work, the right for security of service and for social security, the right to conduct trade union activities and the right to strike as a last resort after having exhausted other legitimate methods of trade unionism for redressal of grievances.
x.	
Improvement in conditions of work, life and social and industrial status.
xi.	
A living wage consistent with a national minimum and due share in the profits in their respective industries as partners.
xii.	
Other appropriate amenities
xiii.	
Expeditious enforcement and appropriate amendment of existing labour legislation in their interest and
xiv.	
Enactment of new labour laws from time to time in consultation with the labour representatives.
(d)	
To inculcate in the minds of the workers the spirit of service, cooperation and dutifulness and develop in them a sense of responsibility towards the nation in general and industry in particular
(e)	
To educate the labour by organising worker’s training classes, study circles, guest lectures, seminars, symposia, excursions etc., in cooperation with institutions and organisations having similar aims and objects such as the Central Board of Workers Education. Labour Research Centre, Universities etc., and also to maintain libraries.
(f)	
To publish or cause publication of journals, periodicals, pamphlets, pictures, books and many other types of literature mainly concerning labour and their interests and to purchase, sell &amp; circulate them.
(g)	
To establish, encourage and organise Labour Research Centres and similar activities.
(h)	
Generally to take such other steps as may be necessary to ameliorate the social, economic, cultural, civic and general conditions of the workers. For sound health of workers and society BMS has been against the use of any type of drugs, liquor, alcohol and smoking.
(i)	
To render assistance or to establish cooperative societies, welfare institutions, clubs etc., for the overall welfare of the common man in general and the workers and their families in particular.

==National Labour Day==
{{unsourced section|date=November 2016}}	
India has a heritage of thousands of year where the [[dignity of labour]] as well as those of labourers was well established. The dire need of the hour is to re-establish the same - the Dignity of Labour by observing our own labour day. As also, most of the Nations have their National Labour Day. National Labour Day was rediscovered to be on Vishwakarma Jayanti, [[Vishwakarma]], being the first craftsman – artisan, sculptor, and engineer - and in fact the traditional symbol of hard labour. This falls on Kanya Sankranti of each year. BMS, since its inception, has been observing Vishwakarma Jayanti – on 17 September of English Calendar Year as National Labour Day.
 
While functioning since 1955 it has given to the labour movement '''new slogans''' benefiting its ideology:
 
*''Bharat Mata Ki Jai''
*We will work in the interest of the country and will take full wage for the work done (''Desh ki hit me kam karenge, kam ki lenge poore dham'')
*The sacrifice, penance and martyrdom are identification of BMS (''BMS ki kya pehchan, Tyag, Tapasya aur Balidan'')
*Understand the value of Capital and Labour is equal and same (''Paise aur pasine ki kimmat samjo ek samaan'').
*Workers unite the world (''Mazdooron duniya ko ek karo'')
*Industrialise the nation, Nationalise the Labour, Labourise the Industry (''Rashtra Udyogikaran, Sharamik ka Rashtriyakaran, Udyog ka Mazdoorikaran'')
*Bonus to all wage earners – as deferred wage (''Sabi Vetanbogiyonko der se diya hua vetan ki roop me bonus'')
*Stop discrimination. Income-ratio should be one and ten. (''Bed-bhav bandh karo. Aay ka anupath Ek aur Dus ho'')

==New trends in the trade union movement==
{{unsourced section|date=November 2016}} 
BMS has contributed quite a few new ideas which have virtually become trend setters.{{Citation needed|reason=vague claim|date=September 2016}}

The non-political nature of BMS has now gained currency and has become acceptable not only in India but also abroad. The XII World Trade Union Congress of WFTU, held in Moscow, in 1990, adopted a document to this effect.
 
BMS doesn't believe in class concept and rejects the class theory propounded by Marx. Instead its struggle and fight is against the injustice on workers from whatever quarters.
 
Being non-political, its attitude towards any democratically elected government is governed by the principle of "Responsive Co-operation".
 
BMS idea of "Labourisation" of Industries – a stage where workers would collectively own and manage the industrial units has initiated a national debate on it. This experiment has been successfully undertaken in New Central Jute Mills, West Bengal.

==New Economic Policy (NEP) and New Industrial Policy (NIP)==
{{unsourced section|date=November 2016}}
While opposing the above policies BMS was first to give slogan for 2nd war of economic independence. At the same time it has suggested some positive alternatives. It has vigorously condemned the abject surrender to the conditionality of the IMF and WB as that would amount to giving up our sovereignty. BMS considers the movement as an opportunity to build up Swadeshi Model of Economy. Hence it has inspired movement for the use of Swadeshi (Indigenous) Products as against the foreign or MNC products.
 
It has offered to cooperate in turning the loss making PSUs profitable where practicable, it has agreed to induce the workers to take up their unit to run them on sound lines.
 
To curb excessive profiteering, which is the main culprit behind price rise; it has suggested that the Government should take steps to make the consumer aware of the cost of production of each product to daily use. This awareness will serve as a watch dog to restrain the prices.
 
BMS is also of the view that for creating enough job opportunities, agricultural development should get more attention as also agro-based and small and tiny industries. Vishwakarma Sector (Self-employment sector) should get more encouragement than at present.
 
On modern technology, BMS while not being antagonistic would prefer developing our own technology based on indigenous and traditional knowledge to best suit our conditions. From this angle national technology policy should be drawn.

==International relations==
{{unsourced section|date=November 2016}} 
Being one of the most representative organisations of Labour, BMS has a place in the Indian delegation to the annual International Labour Conference held by ILO at GENEVA every year.
 
Being largest Central Trade Union Organisation of India, BMS is leading the Indian Labour delegation to ILO, Geneva each year on behalf of Indian workforce.
 
Special Session of United Nations Organisation was held on 5–9 June 2000 in New York on "Women 2000, Gender Equality, Development and Peace for 21st Century". Kum. Suchitra Mahapatra of BMS participated on behalf of Indian Women workforce.
 
It works in close relations with the ILO office in Delhi, participating in all its national and regional level seminars / workshops, its endeavour being to contribute its best.
 
BMS is not affiliated with any International Confederation but maintains cordial relation with all such organisations.
 
Instead of giving call for the workers of the world to unite, it has given a call to the workers all over, to unite the world.

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:BrunoSchweitzer.jpg|thumb|150px|Schweizer in a 1940 photograph]] --&gt;
'''Bruno Schweizer''' (3 May 1897 &amp;ndash; 11 November 1958) was a [[Germany|German]] linguist, best known for his work with the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Ahnenerbe]] division.

Schweizer was a personal believer in the theory that a Germanic stronghold in northeastern [[Italy]] gave rise to the [[Cimbrian]]s, during the [[Middle Ages]] before and after its alleged end in 774.

On March 10, 1938, Schweizer organized an Ahnenerbe-sponsored expedition to [[Iceland]], hoping to discover shrines to the Norse gods [[Odin]] or [[Thor]]. During the expedition later that year, he sent back correspondence to [[Heinrich Himmler]] complaining that the Icelandic people had abandoned traditional crafts such as [[forge|forging]], wood-carving, [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[weaving]] and [[dyeing]]; and that they had also forgotten their traditional myths and legends, thus losing belief in the ‘transcendent nature’ that the Ahnenerbe held dearly to. The mission was eventually aborted, citing uncooperative Icelandic government officials who restricted access to certain locations.

While Schweizer's tight commitment to Germanic racism is disputable, his linguistic works are fully acknowledged and appreciated by former and present linguists.

Buddhist traditions are represented in South Africa in many forms. Although the inherently introspective nature of Buddhism does not encourage census, adherents to these traditions are usually outspoken and supported by perhaps an even greater, though hidden number of sympathisers. Temples, centres and groups are common in the metropolitan areas and the country is thought to comprise the largest Buddhist community in Africa.

==History==
Apart from various Buddhist groups brought to the [[Cape Colony]] from Southeast Asia during the 1680s, and the many indentured labourers brought to [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] from [[India]] during the latter part of the 19th century (some of whom were Buddhist, and some of whom were Hindu who later converted to Buddhism once in South Africa), most Buddhists in South Africa are [[Religious conversion|converts]], and not [[Asians in South Africa|Asian]]. Various Buddhist groups grew up in the major cities from the 1970s, and there has been a proliferation of distinct Buddhist traditions since the mid-1980s. These include [[Theravada]], [[Zen]], [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] schools. 
Sister Palmo (Freda Bedi) was instrumental in establishing the Karma Kagyu School of Tibetan Buddhism in South Africa when she visited in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-maho.com/ebooks/lady-of-realisation&lt;/ref&gt; At the behest of the 16th Karmapa, Choje Akong Tulku Rinpoche set up Samye Dzong Dharma centres in the major South African cities, which are thriving today under guidance of the [http://kagyuoffice.org/karmapa/ 17th Karmapa, Ogyen Drodul Trinley Dorje]. 
The [[Fo Guang Shan]] Buddhist order has erected [[Nan Hua Temple]], the largest Buddhist temple and [[monastery]] in Africa, in the town of [[Bronkhorstspruit]] near [[Pretoria]]. Another notable Buddhist centre in the country is the Buddhist Retreat Centre in [[Ixopo]], KwaZulu-Natal. The Nichiren Buddhist lay group [[Soka Gakkai]] International has a community centre in Parkwood, Johannesburg. Derivatives of Korean Zen have been established in the Western Cape. The Vipassana Association of South Africa founded by [[S. N. Goenka|S.N. Goenka]] has been holding meditation retreats in the Western Cape. More recent additions to the collection of schools include [[Shambhala Buddhism|Shambala]] originally conceived by [[Chögyam Trungpa]], [[Diamond Way Buddhism]], a multicultural Lay Buddhist tradition under the guidance of [[Trinley Thaye Dorje|H.H. 17th Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje]] and the [[New Kadampa Tradition|New Kadampa]] tradition founded by [[Geshe Kelsang Gyatso]].

A 2003 study estimated that in the late 1990s there were a total of 6,000 Buddhists in South Africa (3,000 of whom had Asian ancestry) out of a total population of 42 million (or 0.01% of the total population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DuxOfk1F1EC&amp;dq=number+of+Buddhists+in+South+Africa&amp;oi=print&amp;pg=PA11&amp;ots=2afE4Zblso&amp;sig=gqE8HtC0gJAE-TZTdOWEOMxaMJA&amp;prev=http://www.google.co.za/search%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Dnumber%2Bof%2BBuddhists%2Bin%2BSouth%2BAfrica%26meta%3D&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1 |title=Developments in Australian Buddhism: Facets of the Diamond |last1=Spuler |first1=Michelle |last2=Barker |first2=Michelle |chapter=Australian Buddhism in Context |page=11 |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |year=2003 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; And according to the 2010s estimates, the Buddhist adherents (may included [[Taoism]] and [[Chinese Folk Religion]]) is increasing to between 0.2%&lt;ref name="The Pew Forum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://features.pewforum.org/grl/population-percentage.php#|title=Global Religious Landscape – Religious Composition by Country|publisher=The Pew Forum|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 0.3%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_207_2.asp|title=Religious Adherents, 2010 – South Africa|publisher=World Christian Database|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the South African population, or between 100 and 150 thousand people while the number of practising Buddhists maybe low.

== Dalai Lama's visits ==
Buddhist leaders often visit the country to bestow teachings and blessings. [[14th Dalai Lama|The Dalai Lama]] attended the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in 1999, and again in 2004, but was [[14th Dalai Lama#Refusal of visa to enter South Africa|denied a visa]] when he was asked to attend an international peace conference in March 2009. As well when he was invited to South Africa for [[Desmond Tutu|Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu]]'s 80th birthday party on 7 October 2011.

The 14th [[World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates]] was scheduled to take place in Cape Town, South Africa in 2014, but for the third time, the Dai Lai Lama had been refused a Visa. The summit was cancelled shortly afterwards when several other Nobel peace laureates cancelled their tickets in protest. The 14th peace summit was eventually relocated to Rome, Italy in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/SA-Nobel-Peace-summit-cancelled-reports-20141001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/nobel-peace-summit-south-africa-dalai-lama-visa&lt;/ref&gt;

The South African foreign ministry denied that it had rejected the Dalai Lama's visa application, saying instead that the Tibetan spiritual leader had cancelled his trip, although it is very likely that relations with China was the main reason for the VISA being denied.&lt;ref&gt;http://thediplomat.com/2014/09/south-africa-prevents-dalai-lama-from-attending-nobel-peace-summit/&lt;/ref&gt;
This is evident by two facts.
Firstly, visas have been denied to the Dai Lai Lama before, and in almost every case the destination country had strong ties with China, and it has been claimed that China asked those governments not to accommodate the Nobel peace laureate. Also, in February 2014, the Chinese government reacted in anger as US President Barack Obama ignored their request to not meet with the exiled Tibetan leader.&lt;ref&gt;http://thediplomat.com/2015/02/china-warns-against-obama-dalai-lama-meeting/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/06/barack-obama-attacked-by-chinese-media-for-chumming-with-dalai-lama&lt;/ref&gt;
Secondly, at the time of the third refusal, the top spokesperson for international relations, Clayson Monyela, could not comment on the matter since he was in China on business.&lt;ref&gt;http://news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/Dalai-Lama-denied-visa-to-SA-for-a-third-time-20140904&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the scandal, the Chinese government praised South Africa for their refusal of the visa, and international relations department spokesperson Clayson Monyela's final comment on the issue was that the Tibetan spiritual leader had cancelled his trip to South Africa and (that) his visa application was a closed matter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citypress.co.za/politics/china-thanks-sa-dalai-lama-visa/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dalai Lama later confirmed the media reports when he publicly denounced the South African government during a speech he made in the northern Indian town of Dharamsala. He is quoted as saying, "The Nobel peace summit scheduled to be held in South Africa to honour the legacy of our fellow laureate, the late Nelson Mandela, has been cancelled as the South African government wouldn't allow me to attend it. This is sort of bullying a simple person." At the 14th Summit, fellow laureate, Jody Williams also publicly denounced President Jacob Zuma's government, accusing them of "(selling) their soul and their sovereignty to China".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/02/nobel-peace-summit-south-africa-dalai-lama-visa&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more citations needed|date=December 2014}}
[[File:Patriarchate Constantinopolis.jpg|thumb|Chanters singing on the [[kliros]] at the [[St. George's Cathedral, Istanbul]]]]
In the practice of [[Christianity]], '''canonical hours''' mark the divisions of the day in terms of periods of fixed prayer at regular intervals. A [[book of hours]] normally contains a version of, or selection from, such prayers.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The practice of daily prayers grew from the [[Judaism|Jewish]] practice of reciting prayers at set times of the day known as ''[[zmanim]]'': for example, in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'', [[Saint Peter]] and [[John the Evangelist]] visit the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] for the afternoon prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|3:1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psalm 119]]:164 states: "Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous laws" (of this, [[Symeon of Thessalonica]] writes that "the times of prayer and the services are seven in number, like the number of gifts of the Spirit, since the holy prayers are from the Spirit").&lt;ref&gt;St. Symeon, p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

This practice is believed to have been passed down through the centuries from the [[Apostles]], with different practices developing in different places. As [[Christian monasticism]] spread, the practice of specified hours and liturgical formats began to develop and become standardized. Around the year 484, the Greek-Cappadocian monk [[Sabbas the Sanctified]] began the process of recording the [[liturgy|liturgical]] practices around [[Jerusalem]], while the cathedral and parish rites in the Patriarchate of Constantinople evolved in an entirely different manner.&lt;ref&gt;Taft, Mount Athos:, pp 180, 181, 182, 187, and 189&lt;/ref&gt;

In 525, [[Benedict of Nursia]] set out one of the earliest schemes for the recitation of the Psalter at the Office.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The two major practices were synthesized, commencing in the [[8th century]], to yield an office of great complexity.&lt;ref name=Byzantine_Synthesis&gt;Taft, Mount Athos:, pp 180, 182, 184, 185, 187, and 191&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cluniac Reforms]] of the [[11th century]] renewed an emphasis on liturgy and the canonical hours in the reformed priories of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]], with [[Cluny Abbey]] at their head.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the [[Catholic Church]], canonical hours are also called ''offices'', since they refer to the official set of prayers of the Church, which is known variously as the ''officium divinum'' ("divine service" or "divine duty"), and the ''opus Dei'' ("work of God"). The current official version of the hours in the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church is called the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] (Latin: ''liturgia horarum'') in North America or '''divine office''' in Ireland and Britain.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In [[Anglicanism]], they are often known as the '''daily''' or '''divine office''', to distinguish them from the other 'offices' of the Church (holy communion, baptism, etc.).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the canonical hours may be referred to as the '''[[Divine Service (Eastern Orthodoxy)|divine services]]''', and the ''book of hours'' is called the ''[[horologion]]'' ({{lang-el|῾Ωρολόγιον}}). Despite numerous small differences in practice according to local custom, the overall order is the same among Byzantine Rite monasteries, although parish and cathedral customs vary rather more so by locale. The usage in [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], and the Eastern Catholic counterparts all differ from each other and from other rites.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Already well-established by the [[9th century]] in the West, these canonical offices consisted of eight daily prayer events, including lauds, prime, terce, sext, none, vespers, and compline, as well as the night office, sometimes referred to as vigils, consisting of a number of sections called 'nocturnes'. Building on the recitation of [[psalms]] and [[canticle]]s from [[Religious text|scripture]], the Church has added (and, at times, subtracted) [[hymn]]s, [[hagiography|hagiographical]] readings, and other prayers.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Development ==

=== Judaism and the early church ===
The canonical hours stemmed from [[Jewish prayer]]. In the [[Old Testament]], God commanded the Israelite priests to offer sacrifices of animals in the morning and evening ({{bibleverse||Exodus|29:38–39}}). Eventually, these sacrifices moved from the [[Tabernacle]] to [[Solomon's Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]]. During the [[Babylonian captivity]], when the Temple was no longer in use, the first [[synagogue]]s were established, and the services (at fixed hours of the day) of [[Torah readings]], [[psalms]], and [[hymn]]s began to evolve. This "sacrifice of praise" began to be substituted for the sacrifices of animals.

After the people returned to [[Judea]], the prayer services were incorporated into Temple worship as well. As time passed, the Jews began to be scattered across the Greco-Roman world in what is known as the [[Jewish diaspora]]. By the time of the [[Roman Empire]], the Jews (and eventually early Christians) began to follow the Roman system of conducting the business day in scheduling their times for prayer.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In Roman cities, the [[bell]] in the [[forum (Roman)|forum]] rang the beginning of the business day at about six o'clock in the morning ([[prime (liturgy)|Prime]], the "first hour"), noted the day's progress by striking again at about nine o'clock in the morning ([[Terce]], the "third hour"), tolled for the lunch break at noon ([[Sext]], the "sixth hour"), called the people back to work again at about three o'clock in the afternoon ([[Nones (liturgy)|Nones]], the "ninth hour"), and rang the close of the business day at about six o'clock in the evening (the time for evening prayer).

The narrative of [[Jesus' crucifixion]] and death refers to the sixth and ninth hours:&lt;ref&gt;Mark 15:33–34, 37 (NKJV)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Now when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice ... and breathed His last.}}

The first miracle of the apostles, the healing of the crippled man on the temple steps, occurred because Saint Peter and John the Apostle went to the Temple to pray ({{bibleverse||Acts|3:1}}). Also, one of the defining moments of the early Church, the decision to include [[Gentile]]s among the community of believers, arose from a vision Peter had while praying at noontime ({{bibleverse||Acts|10:9–49}}).

As [[Christianity]] began to separate from [[Judaism]], the practice of praying at fixed times continued. The early church was known to pray the Psalms ({{bibleverse||Acts|4:23–30}}), which have remained the principal part of the canonical hours. By 60 AD, the [[Didache]], the oldest known liturgical manual for Christians, recommended disciples to pray the [[Lord's Prayer]] three times a day; this practice found its way into the canonical hours as well. [[Pliny the Younger]] (63 – c. 113), who was not a Christian himself, mentions not only fixed times of prayer by believers, but also specific services—other than the Eucharist—assigned to those times: "they met on a stated day before it was light, and addressed a form of prayer to Christ, as to a divinity ... after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble, to eat in common a harmless meal."&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger, ''Epistulae'', Book X, [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=117&amp;fk_files=2025 Letter xcvii].&lt;/ref&gt;

By the second and third centuries, such [[Church Fathers]] as [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]], and [[Tertullian]] wrote of the practice of Morning and Evening Prayer, and of the prayers at the third, sixth and ninth hours. The prayers could be prayed individually or in groups.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Sundialtide.JPG|thumb|A [[sundial]] showing the four Tides and five Canonical hours, based on the example on the [[Bewcastle Cross]]]]
As the form of fixed-hour prayer developed in the [[Christian monastic]] communities in the East and West, the Offices grew both more elaborate and more complex, but the basic cycle of prayer still provided the structure for daily life in [[monastery|monasteries]]. By the fourth century, the elements of the canonical hours were more or less established. For secular (non-monastic) clergy and lay people, the fixed-hour prayers were by necessity much shorter, though in many churches, the form of the fixed-hour prayers became a hybrid of secular and monastic practice (sometimes referred to as 'cathedral' and 'monastic' models).

In the East, the development of the Divine Services shifted from the area around Jerusalem to [[Constantinople]]. In particular, [[Theodore the Studite]] (c. 758 – c. 826) combined a number of influences from the Byzantine court ritual with monastic practices common in [[Anatolia]],&lt;ref name=Byzantine_Synthesis /&gt; and added thereto a number of hymns composed by himself and his brother Joseph (see ''[[typikon]]'' for further details).

In the West, the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] was modeled his guidelines for the prayers on the customs of the [[basilica]]s of [[Rome]]. It was he who expounded the concept in Christian prayer of the inseparability of the spiritual life from the physical life. St. Benedict set down the dictum ''Ora et labora'' – "Pray and work". The Order of Saint Benedict began to call the prayers the ''Opus Dei'' or "Work of God." The fixed-hour prayers came to be known as the "Divine Office" (office coming from the Latin word for duty).

As the Divine Office grew more important in the life of the Church, the rituals became more elaborate. Praying the Office already required various books, such as a [[Psalter]] for the psalms, a [[lectionary]] to find the assigned Scripture reading for the day, a [[Bible]] to proclaim the reading, a [[hymnal]] for singing, etc. As parishes grew in the Middle Ages away from [[cathedral]]s and basilicas, a more concise way of arranging the hours was needed. So, a sort of list developed called the [[breviary]], which gave the format of the daily office and the texts to be used. The spread of breviaries eventually reached Rome, where [[Pope Innocent III]] extended their use to the [[Roman Curia]]. The [[Franciscans]] sought a one-volume breviary for their [[friar]]s to use during travels, so the order adopted the ''[[Breviarium Curiae]]'', but  substituting the [[Gallican Rite]] Psalter for the Roman. The Franciscans gradually spread this breviary throughout Europe. Eventually, [[Pope Nicholas III]] adopted the widely used Franciscan breviary to be the breviary used in Rome. By the 14th century, the breviary contained the entire text of the canonical hours.

=== Texts ===

==== Revision by Pope Pius V ====
The [[Council of Trent]], in its final session on 4 December 1563, entrusted the reform of the Breviary to the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Trent, ''Decree on Reformation'', [http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/trentall.html Chapter XXI]&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July 1568, [[Pope Pius V]], the successor of the Pope who closed the Council of Trent, promulgated an edition, known as the [[Roman Breviary]], with his [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Quod a nobis'', imposing it in the same way in which, two years later, he imposed his [[Roman Missal]] and using language very similar to that in the bull ''[[Quo primum]]'' with which he promulgated the Missal, regarding, for instance, the perpetual force of its provisions, the obligation to use the promulgated text in all places, and the total prohibition of adding or omitting anything, declaring in fact: "No one whosoever is permitted to alter this letter or heedlessly to venture to go contrary to this notice of Our permission, statute, ordinance, command, precept, grant, indult declaration, will decree and prohibition. Should anyone, however, presume to commit such an act, he should know that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul."&lt;ref&gt;[http://matt1618.freeyellow.com/novusordo.html In Defense of the Pauline Mass]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Further revision before the Second Vatican Council ====
Later Popes altered the Roman Breviary of Pope Pius V. [[Pope Clement VIII]] made changes that he made obligatory on 10 May 1602, 34 years after Pius V's revision. [[Pope Urban VIII]] made further changes, including "a profound alteration in the character of some of the hymns. Although some of them without doubt gained in literary style, nevertheless, to the regret of many, they also lost something of their old charm of simplicity and fervour."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02768b.htm Breviary] in Catholic Encyclopedia. The article also spoke of "blemishes which disfigure this book."&lt;/ref&gt; For the profound revision of the book by Pope Pius X see [[Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X]].

[[Pope Pius XII]] also began reforming the Roman Breviary, allowing use of a new translation of the [[Psalms]] and establishing a special commission to study a general revision, with a view to which all the Catholic bishops were consulted in 1955. His successor, [[Pope John XXIII]], made a further revision in 1960.

==== Revision following the Second Vatican Council ====

===== Latin typical editions =====
{{Main|Liturgy of the Hours}}

Following the [[Second Vatican Council]], the Catholic Church's [[Roman Rite]] simplified the observance of the canonical hours and sought to make them more suited to the needs of today's apostolate and accessible to the laity, hoping to restore their character as the prayer of the entire Church.

The Council itself abolished the office of Prime, and envisioned a manner of distributing the psalms over a period of more than 1 week.&lt;ref&gt;''Sacrosanctum Concilium'' Art 91. So that it may really be possible in practice to observe the course of the hours proposed in Art. 89, the psalms are no longer to be distributed throughout one week, but through some longer period of time.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the succeeding revision, the character of Matins was changed to an Office of Readings so that it could be used at any time of the day as an office of Scriptural and hagiographical readings. Furthermore, the period over which the entire Psalter is recited has been expanded from one week to four. Since 1985, with the publication of the second typical edition of the Latin liturgical books, the Latin hymns of the Roman Office were once again restored to their pre-Urban revision.

The Roman breviary is now published under the title ''Liturgia Horarum''. A translation is published by Catholic Book Publishing Corp. under the title ''The Liturgy of the Hours'' in four volumes, arranged according to the liturgical seasons of the Church year.
* Volume I: Advent &amp; Christmastide
* Volume II: Lent, the Sacred Triduum &amp; Eastertide
* Volume III: Weeks 1 to 17 of the Year
* Volume IV: Weeks 18 to 34 of the Year

The current [[liturgical book]]s for the celebration of the Hours in Latin are those of the '' editio typica altera'' (second typical edition) promulgated in 1985. The official title is ''Officium Divinum, Liturgia Horarum iuxta Ritum Romanum, editio typica altera''.

===== Official English translations =====

Two English translations are in use.

======The Divine Office (non-ICEL)======
''The Divine Office'' is translated by a commission set up by the Episcopal Conferences of England and Wales, Australia and Ireland. First published in 1974 by [[HarperCollins]], this edition is the official English edition for use the above countries, as well as many Asian and African dioceses. This title comes complete in three volumes:

======Liturgy of the Hours (ICEL)======
The ''Liturgy of the Hours'' is translated by the [[International Commission on English in the Liturgy]] (ICEL). First published in 1975 by Catholic Book Publishing Company in the US, this edition is the official English edition for use in the US, Canada and several other English-speaking dioceses. This title comes complete in four volumes in an arrangement identical to the original Latin typical edition.

The psalms are taken mainly from the 1963 Grail Psalms, while the Scriptural readings and canticles are taken from the [[New American Bible]].

Shorter editions of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] are also available from various publishers: Christian Prayer (Daughters of St Paul and Catholic Book Publishing Company), Shorter Christian Prayer (Catholic Book Publishing Company only) and Daytime Prayer (Catholic Book Publishing Company). In 2007, Liturgy Training Publications released the new Mundelein Psalter, which provided the complete Morning, Evening and Night Prayers from ICEL's translation set to chant tones.

Both these editions are based on the Latin 1971 ''editio typica''.

=== Current practice ===
Priests are required by [[canon law]] to pray the entire Divine Office each day while permanent deacons are required to pray the morning and evening hours. All clerics are free to use the Liturgy of the Hours or the traditional [[Roman Breviary]], according to the ''motu proprio'' [[Summorum Pontificum]], to fulfill this obligation. The practice among religious communities varies according to their rules and constitutions. The [[Second Vatican Council]] also exhorted the Christian laity to take up the practice, and as a result, many lay people have begun reciting portions of the Liturgy of the Hours.

The modern Liturgy of the Hours usage focuses on three major hours and from two to four minor hours:
* [[Invitatory]] (not an hour properly called, but the introduction to the first hour said on the current day, whether it be the Office of Readings or Morning Prayer).
* the Office of Readings (formerly [[Matins]]), major hour
* Morning prayer ([[Lauds]]), major hour
* [[Little Hours|Daytime prayer]], which can be one or all of
** Midmorning prayer ([[Terce]])
** Midday prayer ([[Sext]])
** Midafternoon prayer ([[None (liturgy)|None]])
* Evening prayer ([[Vespers]]), major hour
* Night Prayer ([[Compline]])

==== Major hours ====
The major hours consist of the Office of Readings (formerly [[Matins]]), Morning (or [[Lauds]]) and Evening Prayer (or [[Vespers]]).

The Office of Readings consists of:
* a [[hymn]]
* one or two long [[psalms]] divided into three parts
* a long passage from scripture, usually arranged so that in any one week, all the readings come from the same text
* a long hagiographical passage, such as an account of a [[saint]]'s [[martyr]]dom, or a theological treatise commenting on some aspect of the scriptural reading, or a passage from the documents of the [[Second Vatican Council]]
* on nights preceding Sundays and feast days, the office may be expanded to a ''vigil'' by inserting three [[Old Testament]] [[canticle]]s and a reading from the [[gospels]]
* the hymn ''[[Te Deum]]'' (solemnities, feasts, and Sundays outside of Lent)
* the concluding prayer
* a short concluding verse

The character of Morning Prayer is that of praise; of Evening Prayer, that of thanksgiving. Both follow the same format:
* a hymn
* two psalms, or one long psalm divided into two parts, and a scriptural canticle (taken from the Old Testament in the morning and the [[New Testament]] in the evening)
* a short passage from scripture
* a [[responsory]], typically a verse of scripture, but sometimes liturgical poetry
* a canticle taken from the [[Gospel of Luke]]: the Canticle of Zechariah (''[[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]]'') for morning prayer, and the Canticle of Mary (''[[Magnificat]]'') for evening prayer
* intercessions
* the [[Lord's Prayer]]
* the concluding prayer
* a blessing given by the [[priest]] or [[deacon]] leading Morning or Evening Prayer, or in the absence of clergy and in individual recitation, a short conclusion

==== Minor hours ====
The [[Little Hours|daytime hours]] follow a simpler format:
* a hymn
* three short psalms, or, three pieces of longer psalms; in the daytime hours the psalmody is taken in large part from psalm 119, the longest in the Psalter
* a very short passage of scripture, followed by a responsorial verse
* the concluding prayer
* a short concluding verse

Night prayer has the character of reflection on the day that is past and preparing the soul for its passage to eternal life:
* an [[examination of conscience]]
* a hymn
* one or two psalms
* a short reading from scripture
* the responsory ''In manus tuas, Domine'' (Into Your Hands, Lord)
* the Canticle of Simeon, [[Nunc dimittis]], from the [[Gospel of Luke]], framed by the [[antiphon]] ''Protect us, Lord''
* a concluding prayer
* a short concluding blessing
* a [[Hymns to Mary|hymn to Mary, the mother of Jesus]]

In each office, the psalms and canticle are framed by antiphons, and each concludes with the traditional Catholic [[doxology]].

==== Liturgical variation ====
In addition to the distribution of almost the whole Psalter over a four-week cycle, the Church also provides appropriate hymns, readings, psalms, canticles and antiphons, for use in marking specific celebrations in the [[Roman Calendar]], which sets out the order for the [[liturgical year]]. These selections are found in the 'Proper of Seasons' (for [[Advent]], [[Christmas]], [[Lent]] and [[Easter]]), and the 'Proper of Saints' (for [[Calendar of saints|feast days]] of the Saints).

== Byzantine Rite usage ==

=== Historical development ===
{{further|Typicon#Historical development}}

[[File:Monks and Seminarians on Cliros in Jordanville.jpg|thumb|300px|Monks and Seminarians on Cliros. [[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]]]

Because the [[Byzantine Rite|Rite of Constantinople]] evolved as a synthesis of two distinct rites — cathedral rite of Constantinople called the "asthmatiki akolouthia" ("sung services") and the monastic typicon of the [[Mar Saba|Holy Lavra of Saint Sabbas the Sanctified]] near [[Jerusalem]] — its offices are highly developed and quite complex.

=== Local variations ===
Two main strata exist in the rite, those places that have inherited the traditions of the Russian Church which had been given only the monastic Sabbaite typicon which she uses to this day&lt;ref&gt;Тvпико́нъ сіесть уста́въ (The Typicon which is the Order), p 1&lt;/ref&gt; in parishes and cathedrals as well as in monasteries, and everywhere else where some remnant of the cathedral rite remained in use; therefore, the rite as practiced in monasteries everywhere resembles the Russian recension, while non-Russian non-monastic customs differs significantly. For example, in the Russian tradition, the "[[all-night vigil]]" is served in every church on Saturday nights and the eves of feast days (all though it may be abridged to be as short as two hours) while elsewhere, it is usual to have [[Matins]] on the morning of the feast; however, in the latter instance, [[Vespers]] and matins are rather less abridged but the [[Divine Liturgy]] commences at the end of matins and the hours are not read, as was the case in the extinct cathedral rite of Constantinople.

Also, as the rite evolved in sundry places, different customs arose; an essay on some of these has been written by Archbishop Basil Krivoshein and is posted on the web.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holy-trinity.org/liturgics/krivoshein-greekandrussian.html "Some differences between Greek and Russian divine services and their significance by Basil Krivoshein, Archbishop of Brussels and Belgium"], retrieved 2012-01-01&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liturgical books ===
The '''[[Horologion]]''' ({{lang|grc|῾Ωρολόγιον}}; [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]]: ''Chasoslov'', ''Часocлoвъ''), or  ''Book of Hours'', provides the [[Acolouthia|fixed portions]] of the Daily Cycle of services ({{lang-el|akolouthies}}, {{lang|grc|ἀκολουθίες}}) as used by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic churches]].

Into this fixed framework, numerous moveable parts of the service are inserted. These are taken from a variety of liturgical books:
* '''[[Psalter]]''' (Greek: ''Ψαλτήρ(ιον), Psalter(ion)''; Slavonic: ''Ѱалтырь'' or ''Ѱалтирь, Psaltyr' '') A book containing the 150 [[Psalms]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;There is also a [[Psalm 151]] which is often included in the Psalter, though it is not actually chanted during the Divine Services.&lt;/ref&gt; divided into 20 sections called [[Kathisma]]ta together with the nine Biblical [[canticle]]s which are chanted at Matins; although these canticles had been chanted in their entirety, having over time come to be supplemented by interspersed hymns (analogously to [[sticheron|stichera]]) to form  the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]], the canticles themselves are now only regularly used in a few large monasteries.&lt;ref group=note&gt;excepting in the Russian tradition where they are used weekly on weekdays of Great Lent.&lt;/ref&gt; The Psalter also contains the various "selected psalms", each composed of verses from a variety of psalms, sung at matins on feast days, as well as tables for determining which Kathismata are to be read at each service; in addition to the Psalms read at the daily offices, all the Psalms are read each week and, during Great Lent, twice a week.
* '''[[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]]''' (Greek: ''Ὀκτώηχος''; Slavonic: ''Октоихъ, Oktoikh'' or ''Осмогласникъ, Osmoglasnik'')—Literally, the Book of the "Eight Tones"  or [[Musical mode|modes]]. This book contains a cycle of eight weeks, one for each of the eight [[Echos|echoi]] ([[Gregorian mode|church modes]] of the [[Octoechos|Byzantine musical system of eight modes]]), providing texts for each day of the week for Vespers, Matins, Compline, and (on Sundays) the Midnight Office. The origins of this book go back to compositions by [[John of Damascus|St. John Damascene]].
* '''[[Menaion]]''' (Greek: ''Μηναίον''; Slavonic: ''Минеѧ, Mineya'')—A twelve-volume set which provides liturgical texts for each day of the calendar year,&lt;ref group=note&gt;On non-leap years, the service for 29 Feb. ([[John Cassian|St. John Cassian]]) is chanted at Compline on 28 Feb..&lt;/ref&gt; printed as 12 volumes, one for each month of the year.&lt;ref group=note name=Year_Starts_in_September&gt;The liturgical year begins in September, so the volumes are numbered from 1 for September to 12 for August.&lt;/ref&gt; Another volume, the ''General Menaion'' contains propers for each class of saints for use when the propers for a particular saint are not available. Additionally, locally venerated saints may have services in supplemental volumes, pamphlets, or manuscripts.
* '''[[Menologion]]''' A collection of the lives of the saints and commentaries on the meaning of feasts for each day of the calendar year, also printed as 12 volumes,&lt;ref group=note name=Year_Starts_in_September /&gt; appointed to be read at the meal in monasteries and, when there is an all-night vigil for a feast day, between Vespers and Matins.
* '''[[Triodion]]''' (Greek: ''Τριῴδιον, Triodion''; Slavonic: ''Постнаѧ Трїωдь, Postnaya Triod' ''; Romanian: ''Triodul''), also called the '''Lenten Triodion'''.  The Lenten Triodion contains propers for:
** the [[Pre-Lenten Season]]
** the Forty Days of Great Lent itself
** [[Lazarus Saturday]] and [[Palm Sunday]]
** [[Holy Week]]
* '''[[Pentecostarion]]''' (Greek: ''Πεντηκοστάριον, Pentekostarion''; Slavonic: ''Цвѣтнаѧ Трїωдь, Tsvetnaya Triod' '', literally "Flowery Triodon"; Romanian: ''Penticostar'') This volume contains the propers for the period from [[Easter|Pascha]] to the Sunday of All Saints. This period can be broken down into the following periods:
** [[Bright Week]] (Easter Week) Commencing with matins on [[Easter|Pascha (Easter Sunday)]]  through the following Saturday
** Paschal Season—The period from [[Thomas Sunday]] until [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension]]
** Ascension and its [[Afterfeast]]
** Pentecost and its Afterfeast
** [[All Saints Day|All Saints Sunday]] (the Sunday after Pentecost)
* '''[[Synaxarion]]''' (Greek: ''Συναξάριον''; Romanian: ''Sinaxar'')—The [[Synaxarium|Synaxarion]] contains for each day of the year brief lives of the saints and meanings of celebrated feasts, appointed to be read after the Kontakion and Oikos at Matins.
* '''[[Irmologion]]''' (Greek: ''῾Ειρμολόγιον''; Slavonic: ''Ирмологий, Irmologii'')—Contains the [[Irmos|Irmoi]] chanted at the [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]] of Matins and other services.
* '''[[Euchologion|Priest's Service Book]]''' (Greek: ''῾Ἱερατικόν, Ieratikon''; Slavonic: ''Слѹжебникъ, Sluzhebnik'')—Contain the portions of the services which are said by the priest and deacon and is given to a deacon and to a priest with his vestments at [[Holy orders|ordination]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Originally, the deacon's book and the priest's books were distinct, but upon the invention of printing, it was found more practical to combine them.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bishop's Service Book''' (Greek: ''Ἀρχιιερατικόν Archieratikon'', Slavonic: ''Чиновникъ, Chinovnik'') the portions of the services which are said by the Bishop; for the Canonical Hours, this differs little from what is in the Priest's Service Book.
* '''[[Gospel Book]]''' (Greek: Ευαγγέλιον, Evangelion) Book containing the 4 Gospels laid out as read at the divine services.&lt;ref group=note name=Editing_Gospel_and_Apostle&gt;In Greek editions the ''Evangélion'' is laid out in order of the cycle of readings as they occur in the ecclesiastical year, with a section in the back providing the Gospel readings for Matins, [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Feasts]] and special occasions. In the Slavic usage, the ''Evangélion'' contains the four gospels in canonical order ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], [[Gospel of John|John]]) with annotations in the margin to indicate the beginning and ending of each reading (and an index in the back).&lt;br /&gt;The ''Apostól'' is likewise edited, the Slavonic ''Apostól'' having all of the books of the New Testament (excluding the Gospels and Apocalypse) in their entirety, though not in the same order they are found in most English Bibles ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] is placed first, followed by the Catholic Epistles, etc.).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Apostle Book''' (Greek: ''Απόστολος, Apostolos''; Slavonic: ''Апостолъ, Apostol'') Contains the readings for the Divine Liturgy from the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and the [[Epistles]] together with the [[Prokeimenon]] and [[Alleluia]] verses that are chanted with the readings.&lt;ref group=note name=Editing_Gospel_and_Apostle /&gt;
* '''[[Patristic writings]]''' Many writings from the Church fathers are prescribed to be read at matins and, during great lent, at the hours; in practice, this is only done in some monasteries and frequently therein the abbot prescribes readings other than those in the written rubrics. therefore it is not customary to enumerate all the volumes required for this.
* '''Collections''' (Greek: ''Ανθολόγιον, Anthologion''; Slavonic: ''Сборникъ, Sbornik'') There are numerous smaller anthologies available&lt;ref group=note&gt;For instance, the ''Festal Menaion'' contains only those portions of the ''Menaion'' that have to do with the [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Great Feasts]]; and the ''General Menaion'', et cetera.&lt;/ref&gt; which were quite common before the invention of printing but still are in common use both because of the enormous volume of a full set of liturgical texts and because the full texts have not yet been translated into several languages currently in use.
* '''[[Typicon]]''' (Greek: ''Τυπικόν, Typikon''; Slavonic: ''Тѵпико́нъ, Typikon'' or ''уста́въ, ustav'') Contains all of the rules for the performance of the Divine Services, giving directions for every possible combination of the materials from the books mentioned above into the Daily Cycle of Services.

===Liturgical cycles===&lt;!-- a link from the article [[Liturgical year]] points here --&gt;
Various cycles of the liturgical year influence the manner in which the materials from the liturgical books (above) are inserted into the daily services:

==== Weekly Cycle ====
Each day of the week has its own commemoration:
* ''Sunday''—[[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection of Christ]]
* ''Monday''—The Holy [[Angels]]
* ''Tuesday''—St. [[John the Baptist|John the Forerunner]]
* ''Wednesday''—The [[Christian cross|Cross]] and the [[Theotokos]]
* ''Thursday''—The Holy [[Apostles]] and [[St. Nicholas]]
* ''Friday''—The Cross
* ''Saturday''—[[All Saints' Day|All Saints]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Including, especially, the [[Theotokos]] and the [[Patron Saint]] of the local [[church (building)|church]] or [[monastery]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the departed

Most of the texts come from the ''Octoechos'', which has a large collections of hymns for each weekday for each of the eight tones; during great lent and, to a lesser degree, the pre-lenten season, the ''Lenten Triodion'' supplements this with hymns for each day of the week for each week of that season, as does the ''Pentecostarion'' during the pascal season.  Also, there are fixed texts for each day of the week are in the ''Horologion'' and ''Priest's Service Book'' (e.g., [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissals]]) and the [[Kathisma]]ta (selections from the ''Psalter'') are governed by the weekly cycle in conjunction with the season.

==== Fixed Cycle ====
Commemorations on the [[Fixed Cycle]] depend upon the day of the calendar year, and also, occasionally, specific days of the week that fall near specific calendar dates, e.g., the Sunday before the [[Exaltation of the Cross]]. The texts for this cycle are found in the ''Menaion''.

==== Paschal Cycle ====
The commemorations on the [[Paschal Cycle]] (Moveable Cycle) depend upon the date of [[Easter|Pascha (Easter)]]. The texts for this cycle are found in the ''Lenten Triodion'', the ''Pentecostarion'', the ''Octoechos'' and also, because the daily Epistle and Gospel readings are determined by this cycle, the ''Gospel Book'' and ''Apostle Book''.  The cycle of the ''Octoechos'' continues through the following great lent, so the variable parts of the lenten services are determined by both the preceding year's and the current year's dates of Easter.

===== 8 Week Cycle of the Octoechos =====
The cycle of the [[Octoechos|eight Tones]] is found in the ''[[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]]'' and is dependent on the date of Easter and commences with the [[Thomas Sunday#Eastern churches|Sunday after (eighth day of) Easter]], that week using the first [[echos|tone]], the next week using the second tone, and so, repeating through the week preceding the subsequent [[Palm Sunday]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Each day of [[Bright Week]] (Easter Week) uses propers in a different tone, Sunday: Tone One, Monday: Tone Two, skipping the [[grave tone]] (Tone Seven)&lt;/ref&gt;

===== 11 Week Cycle of the Matins Gospels =====
The portions of each of the Gospels from the narration of the Resurrection through the end are divided into eleven readings which are read on successive Sundays at matins; there are hymns sung at Matins that correspond with that day's [[Matins Gospel]].

=== Daily cycle of services ===
The Daily Cycle begins with [[Vespers]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;In accordance with Old Testament practice, the day is considered to begin in the evening (Genesis 1:5).&lt;/ref&gt; and proceeds throughout the night and day according to the following table:

|}

The '''[[Typica]]''' is served whenever the [[Divine Liturgy]] is not celebrated at its usual time, i.e., when there is a vesperal Liturgy or no Liturgy at all. On days when the Liturgy may be celebrated at its usual hour, the Typica follows the sixth hour (or Matins, where the custom is to serve the Liturgy then) and the Epistle and Gospel readings for the day are read therein;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Typica has a certain correspondence to the [[Missa Sicca]] of the Mediaeval West.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; otherwise, on [[aliturgical days]] or when the Liturgy is served at vespers, the Typica has a much shorter form and is served between the ninth hour and vespers.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolof, p 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, there are [[Inter-Hours]] for the First, Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours. These are services of a similar structure to, but briefer than, the hours. their usage varies with local custom, but generally they are used only during the Nativity Fast, Apostles Fast, and Dormition Fast on days when the lenten alleluia replaces "God is the Lord" at matins, which may be done at the discretion of the [[ecclesiarch]] when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated.

In addition to these public prayers, there are also private prayers prescribed for both monastics and laypersons; in some monasteries, however, these are read in church. These include Morning and Evening Prayers and prayers (and, in Russia, [[canon (hymnography)|canons]]) to be prayed in preparation for receiving the [[Eucharist]].

The full cycle of services are usually served only in monasteries, cathedrals, and other [[Katholikon|katholika]]. In monasteries and parishes of the Russian tradition, the Third and Sixth Hours are read during the [[Liturgy of Preparation|Prothesis ( Liturgy of Preparation)]]; otherwise, the Prothesis is served during Matins, the final portion of which is omitted, the [[Liturgy of the Catechumens]] commencing straightway after the [[troparion]] following the [[Great Doxology]].

The [[Midnight Office]] is seldom served in parishes churches except at the [[Easter Vigil|Paschal Vigil]] as the essential office wherein the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|burial shroud]] is removed from the tomb and carried to the altar.

===Aggregates===&lt;!-- [[Aggregate (liturgy)]] redirects here --&gt;
The sundry Canonical Hours are, in practice, grouped together into aggregates&lt;ref&gt;Sokolof, p 36&lt;/ref&gt; so that there are three major times of prayer a day: Evening, Morning and Midday.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is to conform with Psalm 55:17, "Evening, morning, and noonday will I tell of it and will declare it, and He will hear my voice."&lt;/ref&gt; The most common groupings are as follows:

==== Ordinary days ====
* Evening — Ninth Hour, Vespers, Compline&lt;ref group=note&gt;In monasteries, when there is an evening meal, compline is often separated from vespers and read after the meal; in Greek (απόδειπνον/''apodeipnon'') and Slavonic (Повечерiе/''Pov'echeriye''), the name for Compline literally means, "After-supper."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Morning Watches — Midnight Office,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Midnight Office is often omitted in parish churches.&lt;/ref&gt; Matins, First Hour
* Morning — Third Hour, Sixth Hour, and the [[Divine Liturgy]] or [[Typica]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Though the Liturgy (and Typica) are not, strictly speaking, a part of the daily cycle of services, their placement is fixed by the Typicon in relation to the daily cycle.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Weekdays during lent ====
* Evening — Great Compline
* Morning Watches — Midnight Office, Matins, First Hour
* Morning — Third Hour, Sixth Hour, Ninth Hour, [[Typica]], Vespers (sometimes with the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] or, on the Annunciation, the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom)

==== When there is an all-night vigil ====
On the eves before [[Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church|Great Feasts]] and, in some traditions, on all Sundays, this grouping is used.  However, the [[all-night vigil]] is usually abridged so as to not last literally "all-night" and may be as short as two hours; on the other hand, on Athos and in the very traditional monastic institutions, that service followed by the  hours and Liturgy may last as long as 18 hours.
* Afternoon — Ninth Hour, Little Vespers,&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is an abbreviated, redundant Vespers&lt;/ref&gt; Compline (where it is not read at the commencement of the Vigil)
* Early night — Compline (where it is not the custom for it to follow small vespers), Great Vespers,&lt;ref group=note&gt;On great feast days proceeded by a strict fast (Christmas, Epiphany, and Annunciation on a weekday), the Vigil commences with Great Compline rather than Vespers&lt;/ref&gt; a reading, Matins, First Hour

==== When the royal hours are read ====
* Evening — Ninth Hour, Vespers, Compline
* Morning Watches — Midnight Office, Matins
* Morning — First, Third, Sixth, and Ninth Hours and the Typica

==== On the eves of Christmas, Theophany, and Annunciation ====
When the feast is a weekday (or, in the Russian tradition, on any day for Christmas, Theophany), Vespers (with the Liturgy in most instances) is served earlier in the day and so Great Compline functions much as Great vespers does on the vigils of other feast days.
* Evening — Great Compline (in some traditions) and, if there be an All-Night Vigil, the reading, matins, first hour.
* Morning Watches — (unless there be an all-night vigil) midnight office, matins, first hour.

== Alexandrian Rite ==
The [[Alexandrian Rite]] is observed by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] and the [[Coptic Catholic Church]]. The cycle of canonical hours is largely monastic, primarily composed of psalm readings. The Coptic equivalent of the Byzantine ''Horologion'' is the [[Agpeya]].

Seven canonical hours exist, corresponding largely to the Byzantine order, with an additional "Prayer of the Veil" which is said by Bishops, Priests, and Monks (something like the Byzantine [[Midnight Office]]).

The hours are chronologically laid out, each containing a theme corresponding to events in the life of Jesus Christ:
* '''"Midnight Praise"''' (said in the early morning before dawn) commemorates the Second Coming of Christ. It consists of three watches, corresponding to the three stages of Christ's [[Agony in the Garden|prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane]] ( {{bibleverse||Matthew|25:1–13}} ).
* '''Prime''' (dawn) is said upon waking in the morning or after the Midnight Praise the previous night. Associated with the Eternity of God, the Incarnation of Christ, and his Resurrection from the dead.
* '''Terce''' (9 a.m.) commemorates Christ's [[Pilate's court|trial before Pilate]], the descent of the Holy Spirit at [[Pentecost]].
* '''Sext''' (noon) commemorates the Passion of Christ.
:Terce and Sext are prayed before each Divine Liturgy.
* '''None''' (3 p.m.) commemorates the death of Christ on the Cross. This hour is also read during fasting days.
* '''Vespers''' (sunset) commemorates the taking down of Christ from the Cross.
* '''Compline''' (9 p.m. – before bedtime) commemorates the burial of Christ, the Final Judgment.
:Vespers and Compline are both read before the Liturgy during Lent and the [[Fast of Nineveh]].
* The '''Veil''' is reserved for bishops, priests and monks, as an examination of conscience.

Every one of the Hours follows the same basic outline:
* Introduction, which includes the Lord’s Prayer
* Prayer of Thanksgiving
* Psalm 50 (LXX).
* Various Psalms
* An excerpt from the Holy Gospel
* Short Litanies
* Some prayers (Only during Prime and Compline)
* Lord Have Mercy is then chanted 41 times (representing the 39 lashes Christ received before the crucifixion, plus one for the spear in His side, plus one for the crown of thorns)
* Prayer of "Holy Holy Holy..." and Lord's Prayer
* Prayer of Absolution
* Prayer of Every Hour

== East Syriac Rite ==
The [[East Syriac Rite]] (also known as the Chaldean, Assyrian, or Persian Rite) has historically been used in Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia, and [[Saint Thomas Christians|Malabar]]. The nucleus of the Daily Office is of course the recitation of the Psalter. There are only three regular hours of service (Evening, Midnight, and Morning), with a rarely used Compline. When East Syriac monasteries existed (which is no longer the case) seven hours of prayer were the custom in them, and three ''hulali'' (sections) of the Psalter were recited at each service. This would accomplish the unique feat of the common recitation of the entire Psalter each day.

The present arrangement provides for seven ''hulali'' at each ferial night service, ten on Sundays, three on "Memorials", and the whole Psalter on Feasts of the Lord. At the evening service there is a selection of from four to seven psalms, varying with the day of the week, and also a ''Shuraya'', or short psalm, with generally a portion of [[Psalm 119|Psalm 118]], varying with the day of the fortnight. At the morning service the invariable psalms are 109, 90, 103:1–6, 112, 92, 148, 150, 116. On ferias and "Memorials" Psalm 146 is said after Psalm 148, and on ferias Psalm 1:1–18, comes at the end of the psalms.

The rest of the services consist of prayers, antiphons, litanies, and verses (''giyura'') inserted—like the Greek [[stichera]], but more extensively—between verses of psalms. On Sundays the [[Gloria in Excelsis]] and [[Benedicte (prayer)|Benedicte]] are said instead of Psalm 146. Both morning and evening services end with several prayers, a blessing, (''Khuthama'', "Sealing" ), the kiss of peace, and the Creed.

The variables, besides the psalms, are those of the feast or day, which are very few, and those of the day of the fortnight. These fortnights consist of weeks called "Before" (''Qdham'') and "After" (''Wathar''), according to which of the two choirs begins the service. Hence the book of the Divine Office is called ''Qdham u wathar'', or at full length ''Kthawa daqdham wadhwathar'', the "Book of Before and After".

The East Syriac liturgical Calendar is unique. The year is divided into periods of about seven weeks each, called ''Shawu'i''; these are Advent (called ''Subara'', "Annunciation"), Epiphany, Lent, Easter, the Apostles, Summer, "Elias and the Cross", "Moses", and the "Dedication" (''Qudash idta''). "Moses" and the "Dedication" have only four weeks each. The Sundays are generally named after the ''Shawu'a'' in which they occur, "Fourth Sunday of Epiphany", "Second Sunday of the Annunciation ", etc., though sometimes the name changes in the middle of a ''Shawu'a''. Most of the "Memorials" (''dukhrani''), or saints' days, which have special lections, occur on the Fridays between Christmas and Lent, and are therefore movable feasts; but some, such as [[Christmas]], [[Theophany]], the [[Dormition]], and about thirty smaller days without proper readings, are on fixed days.

There are four shorter fasting periods besides the [[Great Lent]]; these are:
* the ''Fast of Mar Zaya'' (three days after the second Sunday of the Nativity)
* the ''Fast of the Virgins'' (after the first Sunday of the Epiphany)
* the ''Fast of the Ninevites'' (seventy days before Easter)
* the ''Fast of Mart Mariam'' (Our Lady) (from the first to the fourteenth of August)

The Fast of the Ninevites commemorates the repentance of Nineveh at the preaching of Jonas, and is carefully kept. Those of Mar Zaya and the Virgins are nearly obsolete. The Malabar Rite has largely adopted the Roman Calendar, and several Roman days have been added to that of the Chaldean Catholics. The Chaldean Easter coincides with that of the Eastern Orthodox Church, as the [[Julian Calendar]] is used to calculate Easter. The years are numbered, not from the birth of Christ, but from the [[Seleucid era]] (year 1 = 311 B.C.).

== West Syriac Rite ==
The [[West Syriac Rite]], used in [[Syria]] by the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] (Jacobites) and [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Rite Catholic]] is in its origin simply the old rite of [[Antioch]] in the Syriac language. The translation must have been made very early, evidently before the division in the church over [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]], before the influence of [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] over the Antiochian Rite had begun. No doubt as soon as Christian communities arose in the rural areas of Syria the prayers which in the cities (Antioch, Jerusalem, etc.) were said in Greek, were, as a matter of course, translated into Syriac for common use.

In accordance with [[Psalm 119]]:164, "Seven times in the day have I praised Thee for Thy judgments, O Righteous One,"&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 119:164&lt;/ref&gt; the Syriac Orthodox Church observes seven services of prayer each day:
* '''Evening''' or ''Ramsho'' prayer (Vespers)
* '''Drawing of the Veil''' or ''Sootoro'', meaning "Protection", from Psalm 91, which is sung at this prayer, "He who sits under the protection of the Most High" (Compline)
* '''Midnight''' or ''Lilyo'' prayer (Matins)
* '''Morning''' or ''Saphro'' prayer (Prime, 6 a.m.)
* '''Third Hour''' or ''Tloth sho`in'' prayer (Terce, 9 a.m.)
* '''Sixth Hour''' or ''Sheth sho`in'' prayer (Sext, noon)
* '''Ninth Hour''' or ''Tsha` sho`in'' prayer (None, 3 p.m.)

The Midnight prayer (Matins) consists of three ''qawme'' or "watches" (literally "standings"). As in other traditional rites, the ecclesiastical day begins in the evening at sunset with Vespers (''Ramsho''). Today, even in monasteries, the services are grouped together: Vespers and Compline are said together; Matins and Prime are said together; and the Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours are said together; resulting in three times of prayer each day.

The Syriac Orthodox Book of Hours is called the ''Shhimo'', "simple prayer." The ''shhimo'' has offices for the canonical hours for each day of the week. Each canonical office begins and ends with a ''qawmo'', a set of prayers that includes the [[Lord's Prayer]]. At the end of the office, the [[Nicene Creed]] is recited. The great part of the office consists of lengthy liturgical poems composed for the purpose, similar to the Byzantine [[Canon (hymnography)|odes]].

== Armenian Rite ==
The Daily Services in the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] are made up of nine services. The daily cycle of prayer begins with the Night Service, according to the ancient belief that a new day begins at nightfall.

The '''Night Service''' (midnight) Dedicated to the praising of [[God the Father]]. Themes of the service are: thanksgiving to God for the blessing of sleep and asking that the remainder of the night pass in peace and tranquility, and that the next day be spent in purity and righteousness.

The '''Morning Service''' (dawn) Dedicated to the praising of [[God the Son]]. Symbolizes the Resurrection of Christ and his appearance to the [[Myrrh-bearing Women]].

The '''Sunrise Service''' (6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.)&lt;ref group=note&gt;Originally, the Sunrise Service was joined to the Morning Service.&lt;/ref&gt; Dedicated to the praising of the [[Holy Spirit]]. Symbolizes the appearance to Christ to the disciples after the Resurrection.

The '''Third Hour''' (9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.) Dedicated to the Holy Spirit. Symbolizes Eve’s original tasting the forbidden fruit and eventual liberation from condemnation through Jesus Christ. The service has a profound penitential meaning.

The '''Sixth Hour''' (noon) Dedicated to God the Father. Symbolizes Christ's Crucifixion. The prayers at the service ask for God's help towards feeble human nature.

The '''Ninth Hour''' (3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.) Dedicated to God the Son. Symbolizes Christ's death and liberation of humanity from the power of the Hell.

The '''Evening Service''' (before sunset) Dedicated to God the Son. Symbolizes Christ's burial, asks God for a quiet night and a peaceful sleep.

The '''Peace Service''' (after sunset) Dedicated to the Holy Spirit. Symbolizes Christ's descent into Hell and liberation of the righteous from torments.

The '''Rest Service''' (before retiring for sleep) Dedicated to God the Father. In early times it was the continuation of the Peace Service.

In ancient times all nine services were offered every day, especially in monasteries. At present the following services are conducted in churches daily for the majority of the year:
* In the morning: Night and Morning Services together
* In the evening: Evening Service

During [[Great Lent]], all of the services are offered on weekdays (except Saturday and Sunday) according to the following schedule:
* In the morning: Night, Morning and Sunrise Services
* In the afternoon: Third, Sixth, Ninth Hours
* In the evening:
** Monday, Tuesday, Thursday: Peace Service
** Wednesday, Friday: Rest Service
** Saturday, Sunday: Evening Service

The book which contains the hymns which constitute the substance of the musical system of [[Armenian chant|Armenian liturgical chant]] is the ''Sharagnots'' (see [[Octoechos (liturgy)#Armenian Usage|Armenian Octoechos]]), a collection of hymns known as ''Sharakan''. Originally, these hymns were [[Psalms]] and biblical [[Canticle]]s that were chanted during the services, similar to the Byzantine [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]]. In addition, the eight modes are applied to the psalms of the Night office, called ''ganonaklookh'' (Canon head).

== Anglican usage ==
{{details|Book of Common Prayer}}
[[File:Anglican Breviary.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Anglican Rosary]] sitting atop [[Anglican Breviary|The Anglican Breviary]] and [[The Book of Common Prayer]]]]
The [[Book of Common Prayer]], first published in 1549 and revised down the centuries, constitutes the basis of the liturgy for [[Anglicans]] and [[Anglican Use]] Roman Catholics. All Anglican prayer books provide offices for [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]] (often called Mattins or Matins) and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] (colloquially known as Evensong).

Since the early 20th century, revised editions of the Book of Common Prayer or supplemental service books published by Anglican churches have often added offices for midday prayer and [[Compline]]. The proposed Book of Common Prayer (1928) of the [[Church of England]] also restored the office of [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]], although it has only appeared in the 1965 prayer book oh the [[Church of Melanesia]]. In England and other Anglican provinces, service books now include four offices:
* [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]], corresponding to [[Matins]] and [[Lauds]].
* [[Prayer During the Day]], conflating the lesser hours of [[Terce]], [[Sext]], and [[None (liturgy)|None]].
* [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]], corresponding to [[Vespers]].
* [[Compline|Night Prayer, or Compline]].
Some prayer books also include a selection of prayers and devotions specifically for family use. The 1979 Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church in the U.S. also provides an "Order of Worship for the Evening" as a prelude to Evensong with blessings for the lighting of candles and the singing of the ancient Greek lamp-lighting hymn, the [[Phos Hilaron]]. In the [[Church of England]], the publication in 2005 of ''Daily Prayer'', the third volume of [[Common Worship]], adds "Prayer During the Day" to the services for Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer and Compline, and adds a selection of antiphons and responsories for the seasons of the [[Church Year]]. The 1989 New Zealand Prayer Book provides different outlines for Mattins and Evensong on each day of the week, as well as "Midday Prayer," "Night Prayer," and "Family Prayer."

In 1995, the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]] published the ''Contemporary Office Book'' in one volume with the complete psalter and all readings from the two-year Daily Office lectionary.

The traditional structure of Matins and Evensong in most Anglican prayer books reflects the intention by the reforming Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Thomas Cranmer]], to return to the office's older roots as the daily prayer of parish churches. For this purpose, he eliminated the lesser hours and conflated the medieval offices of Matins and Lauds, incorporating the canticles associated with each: the [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]] and  [[Te Deum]]. Similarly, Evening Prayer incorporated both the [[Magnificat]] from Vespers and the [[Nunc Dimittis]] from Compline. In Cranmer's design, each canticle was preceded by a reading from scripture. This parallelism of two readings, each followed by a canticle, is a distinctive feature of the Anglican daily office. For the sake of simplicity, Cranmer also eliminated [[responsory|responsories]] and [[antiphon]]s, although these have been restored in many contemporary Anglican prayer books.

Like many other Reformers, Cranmer sought to restore the daily reading or singing of psalms as the heart of Christian daily prayer. Since his time, every edition of the Book of Common Prayer has included the complete psalter, usually arranged to be read over the course of a month. One distinctive contribution of Anglican worship is a broad repertory of [[Anglican Chant]] settings for the psalms and canticles.

The daily offices have always had an important place in Anglican spirituality. Until comparatively recently Mattins and Evensong were the principal Sunday services in most Anglican churches, sung to settings by composers both ancient and modern.

While Evensong with its musical repertory spanning five centuries continues to play an important role in Anglican worship, the [[eucharist]] has replaced Morning Prayer as the principal service on Sunday mornings in most Anglican parishes and cathedrals.

Most Anglican monastic communities use a Daily Office based on the Book of Common Prayer or on Common Worship but with additional antiphons and devotions. The [[Order of the Holy Cross]] and [[Order of St. Helena]] published ''A Monastic Breviary'' (Wilton, Conn.: Morehouse-Barlow) in 1976. The Order of St. Helena published the ''St. Helena Breviary'' (New York: Church Publishing) in 2006 with a revised psalter eliminating male pronouns in reference to God. The [[All Saints Sisters of the Poor]] also use an elaborated version of the Anglican Daily Office. The [[Society of St. Francis]] publishes ''Celebrating Common Prayer'', which has become especially popular for use among Anglicans.

Some [[Anglo-Catholics]] use the [[Anglican Breviary]], an adaptation of the Pre-Vatican II Roman Rite and the [[Sarum Rite]] in the style of Cranmer's original Book of Common Prayer, along with supplemental material from other western sources, including a common of Octaves, a common of Holy Women, and other material. It provides for the eight historical offices in one volume, but does not include the [[Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary]], which was bound along with many editions of the ''Breviarium Romanum''. Other Anglo-Catholics use the Roman Catholic ''Liturgy of the Hours'' (US) or ''Divine Office'' (UK). Various Anglican adaptations of pre-Vatican II Roman office-books have appeared over the years, among the best known being Canon W. Douglas' translation of the 'Monastic Diurnal' into the idiom of the 'Book of Common Prayer'. Former Anglicans worshiping in [[Roman Catholic]] parishes of the [[Pastoral Provision]] and the [[Personal Ordinariates]] maintain the Anglican flavor of the Daily Office using the [[Book of Divine Worship]], an adaptation of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer approved for [[Anglican Use]] Catholics in 2003.

Historically, Anglican clergy have vested in [[cassock]], [[surplice]] and [[tippet]] for Morning and Evening Prayer, while bishops wear the [[rochet]] and [[chimere]]. In some monastic communities and Anglo-Catholic parishes, the officiant wears surplice or [[alb]], stole and [[cope]] when Evensong is celebrated solemnly.

The canons of the Church of England and some other Anglican provinces require clergy to read Morning and Evening Prayer daily, either in public worship or privately. According to Canon C.24, "Every priest having a cure of souls shall provide that, in the absence of reasonable hindrance, Morning and Evening Prayer daily and on appointed days the Litany shall be said in the church, or one of the churches, of which he is the minister."&lt;ref&gt;Canon C.24&lt;/ref&gt; Canon C.26 stipulates that "Every clerk (cleric) in Holy Orders is under obligation, not being let (prevented) by sickness or some other urgent cause, to say daily the Morning and Evening Prayer...."&lt;ref&gt;Canon C.26&lt;/ref&gt; In other Anglican provinces, the Daily Office is not a canonical obligation but is strongly encouraged.

== Methodist usage ==
[[File:Methodist canonical hours.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Lukan Book of Hours (in purple) and The Book of Offices and Services (in red), both liturgical texts of [[Order of St. Luke|The Order of Saint Luke]], a Methodist religious order]]
F. W. Macdonald, the biographer of [[John Fletcher Hurst|The Rt. Rev. John Fletcher Hurst]], stated that Oxford Methodism "with its almost monastic rigors, its living by rule, its canonical hours of prayer, is a fair and noble phase of the many-sided life of the Church of England".&lt;ref name="Hurst1902"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurst|first=John Fletcher|title=The History of Methodism|year=1902|publisher=Eaton &amp; Mains|pages=310–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional 1784 Methodist Daily Office is contained in ''The Sunday Service of the Methodists'', which was written by [[John Wesley]] himself. It was consequently updated in the ''Book of Offices'', published in 1936 in Great Britain, and ''[[The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)|The United Methodist Book of Worship]]'', published in 1992 in the United States.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradshaw|first=Paul F.|title=New SCM Dictionary of Liturgy and Worship|date=April 2013|publisher=Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd|isbn=978-0-334-04932-6|page=82|quote=The Church in 1935 approved ''Divine Worship'' (versions of morning prayer, other services and numerous collects) and in 1936 authorized the ''Book of Offices'' and, bound in with it, the ''Order for Morning Prayer'': both still exhibited connections to the ''BCP'' and thus Wesley's orders, though the former showed a willingness to include newly composed prayers and those borrowed from other Free Church sources.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some Methodist religious orders publish the Daily Office to be used for that community, for example, ''The Book of Offices and Services of The Order of Saint Luke'' contains [[Lauds|Morning]], [[Terce|Mid-Morning]], [[Sext|Noon]], [[Nones (liturgy)|Mid-Afternoon]], [[Vespers|Evening]], [[Compline]] and [[Vigil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Offices and Services|date=6 September 2012|publisher=[[Order of St. Luke]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liberal Catholic usage ==
The [[Liberal Catholic Church]], and many groups in the [[Liberal Catholic movement]], also use a simple version of the Western canonical hours, said with various scripture reading and collects. According to the ''Liturgy of the Liberal Catholic Church,'' the Scriptures used are generally limited to the readings of the day, and the complete psalter is not incorporated unless at the discretion of the priest presiding, if as a public service, or of the devotee in private use. The Hours of the Liberal Rite consist of: Lauds, Prime, Sext, Vespers, and Complin.
Its recitation is not obligatory on Liberal Catholic priests or faithful, according to current directs from the General Episcopal Synod.

A pew edition of the Hours was published in 2002 by St. Alban's Press. However, the ''Liturgy of the Liberal Catholic Church'' also includes the Hours for recitation.

== Reformed and Lutheran usage ==
Some Reformed churches—notably the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] and the [[United Church of Christ]]—have published daily office books adapted from the ancient structure of morning and evening prayer in the Western church, usually revised for the purpose of [[inclusive language]].

''The New Century Psalter'', published in 1999 by The Pilgrim Press, includes an inclusive-language revision of the psalms adapted from the [[New Revised Standard Version]] of the Bible with refrains and complete orders for Morning and Evening Prayer. Simple family prayers for morning, evening and the close of day are also provided.

''Book of Common Worship Daily Prayer'', published in 1994 by [[Westminster John Knox Press]], includes the daily offices from [[The Book of Common Worship of 1993]], the liturgy of the [[Presbyterian Church USA]]. In addition to Morning and Evening Prayer there is a complete service for Compline. Its psalter—an inclusive-language revision of the psalter from the 1979 American [[Book of Common Prayer]]—also includes a collect for each psalm. Antiphons and litanies are provided for the seasons of the church year.

Both books are intended for ecumenical use and can be used with any daily lectionary.

Lutheran worship books usually include orders for Morning and Evening Prayer as well as Compline. Liturgies published by immigrant Lutheran communities in North America were based at first on the [[Book of Common Prayer]]. In recent years, under the impact of the liturgical movement, Lutheran churches have restored the historic form of the Western office. Both ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'' published by the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] as well as the ''[[Lutheran Service Book]]'' of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] provide daily offices along with a complete psalter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3518">'''Eskandar II''' ({{lang-fa|اسکندر}}), was the ruler of the [[Paduspanids|Paduspanid dynasty]] from 1333 to 1359. He was the son and successor of [[Taj al-Dawla Ziyar]].

== Biography ==
When Eskandar ascended the Paduspanid throne, the [[Ilkhanids|Ilkhanate Empire]] was quickly declining. This gave him a favorable occasion to expand his rule over [[Alborz]], [[Qazvin]], and [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]].

In 1344, the [[Sarbadars|Sarbadar]] ruler [[Wajih ad-Din Mas'ud]], sought to increase his territorial domains, and thus in 1344 invaded the domains of the [[Bavandid]] [[Hasan II of Tabaristan]] and Eskandar II in [[Mazandaran]] with several hostile minor dynasties allied against him. When the Sarbadars advanced on [[Amol]], Hasan decided to abandon the city. He then turned around and defeated the Sarbadar garrison at [[Sari, Iran|Sari]], cutting off Mas'ud's line of retreat. Despite this, Mas'ud decided to press on. When Hasan attacked his rear, however, and Eskandar II met him at his front, Mas'ud was surrounded. The Sarbadars were decimated, and Mas'ud was captured by Eskandar II. He was handed over to the son of one of [[Togha Temur]]'s former officials who had died fighting the Sarbadars in 1341/1342. Mas'ud was then executed by the latter.

After having secured his kingdom from enemy threat, Eskandar began strengthening his kingdom; he founded the city of [[Kojur]] which became his capital. He then began taking various civilians and nobles from the cities he had conquered, and re-settled them in Kojur. In 1349, Hasan was murdered by the two sons of [[Kiya Afrasiyab]], a powerful [[Afrasiyab dynasty|Afrasiyab]] nobleman. An unnamed son of Hasan fled to the court of Eskandar, where he was warmly received. Eskandar, hoping to restore Bavand rule, invaded the domains of Afrasiyab, he was however, defeated at [[Amol]]. Eskandar later died in 1359, after being mistakenly wounded by his own bodyguard. He was succeeded by his brother [[Fakhr al-Dawla Shah-Ghazi]].

'''Etruscan religion''' comprises a set of stories, beliefs, and [[religious]] practices of the [[Etruscan civilization]], originating in the 7th century BC from the preceding [[Iron Age]] [[Villanovan culture]], heavily influenced by the mythology of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Phoenicia]], and sharing similarities with concurrent [[Roman mythology]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|religion]]. As the Etruscan civilization was assimilated into the [[Roman Republic]] in the 4th century BC, the Etruscan [[religion]] and [[mythology]] were partially incorporated into classical Roman culture, following the Roman tendency to absorb some of the local gods and customs of conquered lands. 

==Beliefs==
The Etruscan system of belief was an [[Immanence|immanent]] [[polytheism]]; that is, all visible phenomena were considered to be manifestations of [[divinity|divine]] power, and that power was embodied in [[deity|deities]] who acted continually on the world but could be dissuaded or persuaded by mortal men.

Long after the assimilation of the Etruscans, [[Seneca the Younger]] said&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seneca the Younger|title=Naturales Quaestiones|chapter=II.32.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the difference between the Romans and the Etruscans was that&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas we believe lightning to be released as a result of the collision of clouds, they believe that the clouds collide so as to release lightning: for as they attribute all to deity, they are led to believe not that things have a meaning insofar as they occur, but rather that they occur because they must have a meaning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Spirits and deities===
{{Main|List of Etruscan mythological figures|List of Etruscan names for Greek heroes}}
[[Image:0 Mars de Todi - Museo Gregoriano Etruscano (1).JPG|thumb|The ''[[Mars of Todi]]'', a life-sized [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[bronze sculpture]] of a soldier making a [[votive offering]], most likely to [[Laran]], the Etruscan god of war, late 5th to early 4th century BC]]
Around the ''mun'' or ''muni'', or tombs,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} were the ''man'' or ''mani'' (Latin ''Manes''), the souls of the ancestors. In iconography after the 5th century BC, the deceased are shown traveling to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, I. 2006. "The Grave and Beyond." ''The Religion of the Etruscans.'' edited by N. de Grummond and E. Simon. Austin: University of Texas Press. p. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;  In several instances of Etruscan art, such as in the [[François Tomb]] in Vulci, a spirit of the dead is identified by the term ''hinthial'', literally "(one who is) underneath".

A god was called an ''ais'' (later ''eis''), which in the plural is ''aisar''.  The abode of a god was a ''fanu'' or ''luth'', a sacred place, such as a ''favi'', a grave or temple. There, one would need to make a ''fler'' (plural ''flerchva''), or "offering".

Three layers of deities are portrayed in Etruscan art. One appears to be lesser divinities of an indigenous origin: [[Catha (mythology)|Catha]] and [[Usil (god)|Usil]], the sun; [[Tivr]], the moon; [[Selvans]], a civil god; [[Turan (mythology)|Turan]], the goddess of love; [[Laran]], the god of war; [[Leinth]], the goddess of death; [[Maris (mythology)|Maris]], [[Thalna]], [[Turms]] and the god [[Fufluns]], whose name is related in some unknown way to the city of [[Populonia]] and the [[populus Romanus]].

Ruling over them were higher deities that seem to reflect the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] system: Tin or [[Tinia]], the sky, [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]] his wife ([[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]), and [[Cel (goddess)|Cel]], the earth goddess.

As a third layer, the Greek gods were adopted by the Etruscan system during the Etruscan Orientalizing Period of 750/700-600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Dates from De Grummond &amp; Simon (2006), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are [[Aritimi]] ([[Artemis]]), [[Menrva]] ([[Minerva]]; Latin equivalent of [[Athena]]), and Pacha ([[Dionysus|Bacchus]]; Latin equivalent of [[Dionysus]]), and over time the primary trinity became [[Tinia]], [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]] and [[Menrva]].

==Seers and divinations==
The Etruscans believed their religion had been [[Revelation|revealed]] to them by seers,&lt;ref name="Cary"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cary|first=M.|last2=Scullard|first2=H. H.|title=A History of Rome|page=24|edition=3rd|year= 1979|isbn=0-312-38395-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the two main ones being [[Tages]], a childlike figure born from tilled land who was immediately gifted with [[prescience]], and [[Vegoia]], a female figure.

The Etruscans believed in intimate contact with divinity.&lt;ref name=P143&gt;The religiosity of the Etruscans most clearly manifested itself in the so-called 'discipline', that complex of rules regulating relations between men and gods. Its main basis was the scrupulous search for the divine will by all available means; ... the reading and interpretation of animal entrails, especially the liver ... and the interpretation of lightning. {{harv|Pallottino|1975|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did nothing without proper consultation with the gods and signs from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Titus|last=Livius|authorlink=Livy|title=History of Rome|chapter=V.1|quote=...a people more than any others dedicated to religion, the more as they excelled in practicing it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These practices were taken over in total by the Romans.

===''Etrusca Disciplina''===
The Etruscan [[Religious text|scriptures]] were a corpus of texts termed the ''Etrusca Disciplina''. This name appears in [[Valerius Maximus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Valerius|last=Maximus|title=Factorum et Dictorum Memorabilia|chapter=1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] refers to a ''disciplina'' in his writings on the subject.

[[Massimo Pallottino]] summarizes the known (but non-extant) scriptures as the ''Libri Haruspicini'', containing the theory and rules of [[Haruspex|divination from animal entrails]]; the ''Libri Fulgurales'', describing divination from lightning strikes; and the ''Libri Rituales''. The last was composed of the ''Libri Fatales'', detailing the religiously correct methods of founding cities and shrines, draining fields, formulating laws and ordinances, measuring space and dividing time; the ''Libri Acherontici'', dealing with the hereafter; and the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ostentarium|Libri Ostentaria]]'', containing rules for interpreting prodigies. The revelations of the prophet [[Tages]] were given in the ''Libri Tagetici'', which included the ''Libri Haruspicini'' and the ''Acherontici'', and those of the prophetess [[Vegoia]] in the ''Libri Vegoici'', which included the ''Libri Fulgurales'' and part of the ''Libri Rituales''.&lt;ref name=P154&gt;{{harvnb|Pallottino|1975|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These works did not present prophecies or scriptures in the ordinary sense: the ''Etrusca Disciplina'' foretold nothing itself. The Etruscans appear to have had no systematic ethics or religion and no great visions. Instead they concentrated on the problem of the will of the gods: questioning why, if the gods created the universe and humanity and have a will and a plan for everyone and everything in it, they did not devise a system for communicating that will in a clear manner.

The Etruscans accepted the inscrutability of their gods' wills. They did not attempt to rationalize or explain divine actions or formulate any doctrines of the gods' intentions. As answer to the problem of ascertaining the divine will, they developed an elaborate system of [[divination]]; that is, they believed the gods offer a perpetual stream of [[wikt:omen|signs]] in the phenomena of daily life, which if read rightly can direct humanity's affairs. These revelations may not be otherwise understandable and may not be pleasant or easy, but are perilous to doubt.

The Etrusca Disciplina therefore was mainly a set of rules for the conduct of all sorts of divination; Pallottino calls it a religious and political "constitution": it does not dictate what laws shall be made or how humans are to behave, but rather elaborates rules for asking the gods these questions and receiving answers.

Cicero said&lt;ref&gt;De Divinatione, section 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;For a hasty acceptance of an erroneous opinion is discreditable in any case, and especially so in an inquiry as to how much weight should be given to auspices, to sacred rites, and to religious observances; for we run the risk of committing a crime against the gods if we disregard them, or of becoming involved in old women's superstition if we approve them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He then quipped, regarding divination from the singing of frogs:&lt;blockquote&gt;Who could suppose that frogs had this foresight? And yet they do have by nature some faculty of premonition, clear enough of itself, but too dark for human comprehension.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Priests and officials===
[[File:Etruscan temple Orvieto.jpeg|thumb|right|Rare Etruscan ''fanu'' located at [[Orvieto]].]]
Divinatory inquiries according to discipline were conducted by priests whom the Romans called [[haruspices]] or sacerdotes; Tarquinii had a college of 60 of them.&lt;ref name=P154/&gt; The Etruscans, as evidenced by the inscriptions, used several words: ''capen'' ([[Sabine]] ''cupencus''), ''maru'' ([[Umbrian]] ''maron-''), ''eisnev'', ''hatrencu'' (priestess). They called the art of haruspicy ''ziχ neθsrac''.

A special magistrate, the ''cechase'', looked after the ''cecha'' or ''rath'', sacred things. Every man, however, had his religious responsibilities, which were expressed in an ''alumnathe'' or ''slecaches'', a sacred society. No public event was conducted without the ''netsvis'', the ''haruspex'', or his female equivalent, the ''nethsra'', who would read the bumps on the liver of a properly sacrificed sheep. We have a [[Liver of Piacenza|model of a liver]] made of bronze, whose religious significance is still a matter of heated debate, marked into sections which perhaps are meant to explain what a bump in that region would mean.

==Afterlife==
Etruscan beliefs concerning the hereafter appear to be an amalgam of influences. The Etruscans shared general early Mediterranean beliefs, such as the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] belief that survival and prosperity in the hereafter depend on the treatment of the deceased's remains.&lt;ref name=P148&gt;{{harvnb|Pallottino|1975|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Etruscan tombs imitated domestic structures and were characterized by spacious chambers, wall paintings and grave furniture. In the tomb, especially on the sarcophagus (examples shown below), was a representation of the deceased in his or her prime, often with a spouse. Not everyone had a sarcophagus; sometimes the deceased was laid out on a stone bench. As the Etruscans practiced mixed inhumation and cremation rites (the proportion depending on the period), cremated ashes and bones might be put into an urn in the shapes of a house or a representation of the deceased.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In addition to the world still influenced by terrestrial affairs was a transmigrational world beyond the grave, patterned after the Greek [[Hades]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} It was ruled by [[Aita (mythology)|Aita]], and the deceased was guided there by [[Charun]], the equivalent of Death, who was blue and wielded a hammer. The Etruscan Hades was populated by Greek mythological figures and a few such as [[Tuchulcha]], of composite appearance.

==Roman conquest==
After the Etruscan defeat in the [[Roman–Etruscan Wars]], the remaining Etruscan culture began to be assimilated into the Roman. The [[Roman Senate]] adopted key elements of the Etruscan religion, which were perpetuated by [[haruspices]] and noble Roman families who claimed Etruscan descent, long after the general population had forgotten the language. However, in the last years of the [[Roman Republic]] the religion began to fall out of favor and was satirized by such notable public figures as [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]]. The [[Julio-Claudians]], especially [[Claudius]], who claimed a remote Etruscan descent, maintained a knowledge of the language and religion for a short time longer&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Life of Claudius'', 42&lt;/ref&gt;, but this practice soon ceased. A number of [[canon (fiction)|canon]]ical works in the Etruscan language survived until the middle of the first millennium AD, but were destroyed by the ravages of time, decree of the Roman Senate, and by fire.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Sources==
The mythology is evidenced by a number of sources in different media; for example, representations on large numbers of pottery, inscriptions and engraved scenes on the Praenestine ''cistae'' (ornate boxes; see under [[Etruscan language]]) and on ''specula'' (ornate hand mirrors). Currently some two dozen fascicles of the ''[[Corpus Speculorum Etruscorum]]'' have been published. Specifically Etruscan mythological and cult figures appear in the ''[[Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An illustrated lexicon about the ancient myths|url=http://www.limcnet.org/LIMCLink/LIMC/tabid/198/Default.aspx|publisher=Foundation for the ''Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae'' (LIMC)|year=2009|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Etruscan inscriptions have recently been given a more authoritative presentation by [[Helmut Rix]], ''Etruskische Texte''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rix, Helmut|title=Etruskische Texte|location=Tübingen|publisher=Gunter Narr Verlag|year=1991|isbn=3-8233-4240-1|language=German, Etruscan|series=ScriptOralia}} 2 vols.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Flying Dutchman''''' ({{lang-nl|De Vliegende [[Holland]]er}}) is a legendary [[ghost ship]] that can never make port and is doomed to sail the oceans forever. The myth is likely to have originated from the 17th-century golden age of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC). The oldest extant version has been dated to the late 18th century.  Sightings in the 19th and 20th centuries reported the ship to be glowing with ghostly light. If hailed by another ship, the crew of the ''Flying Dutchman'' will try to send messages to land, or to people long dead. In ocean lore, the sight of this phantom ship is a [[Portent (divination)|portent]] of doom.

==Origins==

The first print reference to the ship appears in ''Travels in various part of Europe, Asia and Africa during a series of thirty years and upward'' (1790) by John MacDonald :

{{quote|The weather was so stormy that the sailors said they saw the ''Flying Dutchman''. The common story is that this ''Dutchman'' came to the Cape in distress of weather and wanted to get into harbour but could not get a pilot to conduct her and was lost and that ever since in very bad weather her vision appears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=John|title=Travels in various part of Europe, Asia and Africa during a series of thirty years and upward|editor=Forbes, London|date=1790|page=276|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=jCBhAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=%22flying+dutchman%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAWoVChMIgoyTpZ7BxwIVx74UCh14uQ0_#v=onepage&amp;q=%22flying%20dutchman%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The next literary reference appears in Chapter VI of ''A Voyage to Botany Bay'' (1795) (also known as ''A Voyage to New South Wales''), attributed to [[George Barrington]] (1755–1804):{{refn|George Barrington (originally Waldron) was tried at the [[Old Bailey]] in [[London]] in September 1790 for picking pockets and sentenced to [[transportation]] for seven years. He embarked on the convict transport ''Active'' which sailed from [[Portsmouth]] on 27 March 1791 and arrived at [[Port Jackson]] (Sydney), just to the north of [[Botany Bay]], on 26 September, having anchored briefly at [[Table Bay]] in very late June. The various accounts of his voyage and activities in [[New South Wales]] appear to be literary forgeries by publishers capitalizing both on his notoriety and in public interest for the new colony, combining turns of phrase from his trial speeches with plagiarized genuine accounts of other writers concerning Botany Bay. See ''George Barrington's Voyage to Botany Bay'' edited by Suzanne Rickard (Leicester University Press, 2001). ''A Voyage to Botany Bay'' and ''A Voyage to New South Wales'', both issued in 1795, were revamped versions of ''An Impartial and Circumstantial Narrative of the Present State of Botany Bay'', which had appeared in 1793–94, but which did not include the ''Flying Dutchman'' reference.|group=nb}}

{{quote|I had often heard of the superstition of sailors respecting apparitions and doom, but had never given much credit to the report; it seems that some years since a Dutch man-of-war was lost off the Cape of Good Hope, and every soul on board perished; her consort weathered the gale, and arrived soon after at the Cape. Having refitted, and returning to Europe, they were assailed by a violent tempest nearly in the same latitude. In the night watch some of the people saw, or imagined they saw, a vessel standing for them under a press of sail, as though she would run them down: one in particular affirmed it was the ship that had foundered in the former gale, and that it must certainly be her, or the apparition of her; but on its clearing up, the object, a dark thick cloud, disappeared. Nothing could do away the idea of this phenomenon on the minds of the sailors; and, on their relating the circumstances when they arrived in port, the story spread like wild-fire, and the supposed phantom was called the ''Flying Dutchman''. From the Dutch the English seamen got the infatuation, and there are very few Indiamen, but what has some one on board, who pretends to have seen the apparition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barrington|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The next literary reference introduces the motif of punishment for a crime, in ''Scenes of Infancy'' (Edinburgh, 1803) by [[John Leyden]] (1775–1811):

{{quote|It is a common superstition of mariners, that, in the high southern latitudes on the coast of Africa, hurricanes are frequently ushered in by the appearance of a spectre-ship, denominated the ''Flying Dutchman''&amp;nbsp;... The crew of this vessel are supposed to have been guilty of some dreadful crime, in the infancy of navigation; and to have been stricken with pestilence&amp;nbsp;... and are ordained still to traverse the ocean on which they perished, till the period of their penance expire.{{refn|Leyden says that Chaucer, echoing [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's Inferno]] Second Circle of Hell, alludes to a punishment of a similar kind in his poem ''The Parlement of Foules'': "And breakers of the laws, sooth to sain, / And lecherous folk, after that they been dead, / Shall whirl about the world alway in pain, / Till many a world be passed out of dread.|group=nb}}}}

[[Thomas Moore]] (1779–1852) places the vessel in the north Atlantic in his poem ''Written on passing Dead-man's Island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Late in the evening, September, 1804'':&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''Epistles, Odes, and other poems'' (London, 1806)&lt;/ref&gt; "Fast gliding along, a gloomy bark / Her sails are full, though the wind is still, / And there blows not a breath her sails to fill." A footnote adds: "The above lines were suggested by a superstition very common among sailors, who call this ghost-ship, I think, 'the flying Dutch-man'."

[[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]] (1771–1832), a friend of John Leyden's, was the first to refer to the vessel as a pirate ship, writing in the notes to ''[[Rokeby (poem)|Rokeby; a poem]]'' (first published December 1812) that the ship was "originally a vessel loaded with great wealth, on board of which some horrid act of murder and piracy had been committed" and that the apparition of the ship "is considered by the mariners as the worst of all possible omens."

According to some sources, 17th-century Dutch [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] [[Bernard Fokke]] is the model for the captain of the ghost ship.&lt;ref&gt;Eyers, Jonathan (2011). ''Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions''. A&amp;C Black, London, UK. {{ISBN|978-1-4081-3131-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fokke was renowned for the speed of his trips from the [[Netherlands]] to [[Java (island)|Java]] and was suspected of being [[Pact with the Devil|in league with the Devil]]. The first version of the legend as a story was printed in ''[[Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine]]'' for May 1821,&lt;ref&gt;The author has been identified as John Howison (fl. 1821–59) of the East India Company. See Alan Lang Strout: ''A Bibliography of Articles in Blackwood's Magazine 1817–1825'' (1959, p. 78).&lt;/ref&gt; which puts the scene as the Cape of Good Hope. This story introduces the name Captain Hendrick Van der Decken for the captain and the motifs (elaborated by later writers) of letters addressed to people long dead being offered to other ships for delivery, but if accepted will bring misfortune; and the captain having sworn to round the Cape of Good Hope though it should take until the day of judgment.

{{quote|She was an Amsterdam vessel and sailed from port seventy years ago. Her master's name was Van der Decken. He was a staunch seaman, and would have his own way in spite of the devil. For all that, never a sailor under him had reason to complain; though how it is on board with them nobody knows. The story is this: that in doubling the Cape they were a long day trying to weather the Table Bay. However, the wind headed them, and went against them more and more, and Van der Decken walked the deck, swearing at the wind. Just after sunset a vessel spoke him, asking him if he did not mean to go into the bay that night. Van der Decken replied: "May I be eternally damned if I do, though I should beat about here till the day of judgment." And to be sure, he never did go into that bay, for it is believed that he continues to beat about in these seas still, and will do so long enough. This vessel is never seen but with foul weather along with her.&lt;ref name="Music with Ease "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicwithease.com/flying-dutchman-source.html |title=Source of the Legend of The Flying Dutchman |accessdate=2008-02-23 |publisher=Music with Ease |year=2008 |author=Music with Ease}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reported sightings==
There have been many reported or alleged sightings in the 19th and 20th centuries.  A well-known sighting was by Prince George of Wales, the future [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. He was on a three-year voyage during his late adolescence in 1880 with his elder brother [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence|Prince Albert Victor of Wales]] and their tutor John Neill Dalton. They temporarily shipped into {{HMS|Inconstant|1868|6}} after the damaged rudder was repaired in their original ship, the 4,000-tonne corvette [[HMS Bacchante (1876)|''Bacchante'']]. The princes' log (indeterminate as to which prince, due to later editing before publication) records the following for the pre-dawn hours of 11 July 1881, off the coast of [[Australia]] in the [[Bass Strait]] between [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]]:

{{quote|July 11th. At 4 a.m. the ''Flying Dutchman'' crossed our bows. A strange red light as of a phantom ship all aglow, in the midst of which light the masts, spars and sails of a brig 200 yards distant stood out in strong relief as she came up on the port bow, where also the officer of the watch from the bridge clearly saw her, as did the quarterdeck midshipman, who was sent forward at once to the forecastle; but on arriving there was no vestige nor any sign whatever of any material ship was to be seen either near or right away to the horizon, the night being clear and the sea calm. Thirteen persons altogether saw her&amp;nbsp;... At 10.45 a.m. the ordinary seaman who had this morning reported the ''Flying Dutchman'' fell from the foretopmast crosstrees on to the topgallant forecastle and was smashed to atoms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Rose|Rose, Kenneth]] (1988) ''King George V''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Nicholas Monsarrat]], the novelist who wrote ''[[The Cruel Sea (novel)|The Cruel Sea]]'', described the phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean in his unfinished final book "Master Mariner", which was partly inspired by this tale (he lived and worked in South Africa after the war) and the story of the [[Wandering Jew]].

==Explanations as an optical illusion==
{{Main|Mirage|Fata Morgana (mirage)|Looming and similar refraction phenomena}}
Probably the most credible explanation is a superior [[mirage]] or [[Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fata Morgana]] seen at sea.

[[Image:Superior mirage of the boats painting.jpg|thumb|250px|Book illustration showing [[superior mirage]]s of two boats]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;The news soon spread through the vessel that a phantom-ship with a ghostly crew was sailing in the air over a phantom-ocean, and that it was a bad omen, and meant that not one of them should ever see land again. The captain was told the wonderful tale, and coming on deck, he explained to the sailors that this strange appearance was caused by the reflection of some ship that was sailing on the water below this image, but at such a distance they could not see it. There were certain conditions of the atmosphere, he said, when the sun's rays could form a perfect picture in the air of objects on the earth, like the images one sees in glass or water, but they were not generally upright, as in the case of this ship, but reversed—turned bottom upwards. This appearance in the air is called a mirage. He told a sailor to go up to the foretop and look beyond the phantom-ship. The man obeyed, and reported that he could see on the water, below the ship in the air, one precisely like it. Just then another ship was seen in the air, only this one was a steamship, and was bottom-upwards, as the captain had said these mirages generally appeared. Soon after, the steamship itself came in sight. The sailors were now convinced, and never afterwards believed in phantom-ships.&lt;ref name="WHEN WE MUST NOT BELIEVE OUR EYES"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17582/17582-h/17582-h.htm Round-about Rambles in Lands of Fact and Fancy] by [[Frank R. Stockton]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another optical effect known as [[Looming and similar refraction phenomena#Looming|looming]] occurs when rays of light are bent across different refractive indices. This could make a ship just off the horizon appear hoisted in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyer-Arendt|1995|p=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
There is a 20-foot [[one-design]] high-performance two-person [[monohull]] racing [[dinghy]] named the [[Flying Dutchman (dinghy)|''Flying Dutchman'' (FD)]]. It made its Olympic debut at the [[Sailing at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games]] and is still one of the fastest racing dinghies in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussailing.org/portsmouth/tables08/tables08cb.asp Portsmouth tables] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216155752/http://www.ussailing.org/portsmouth/tables08/tables08cb.asp |date=2012-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In artworks and design===
''The Flying Dutchman'' has been captured in paintings by [[Albert Ryder]], now in the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and by [[Howard Pyle]], whose painting of the ''Flying Dutchman'' is on exhibit at the Delaware Art Museum.

Dutch artist Joyce Overheul also adapted the name of ''The Flying Dutchman'' onto her crochet pattern designs (''The Flying Dutchman Crochet Design''), resembling the similarity of her designs 'roaming' the world just like the ghost ship once did.

''Flying Dutchman'' Tobacco was a popular blend for pipes and smoking. Many of their tins are still readily collected by those who appreciate packaging art and design.

===In television series and comics===
* Scooby-Doo featured a Flying Dutchman ghost modeled after the illustrator Howard Pyle's 1900 depiction of the character 
* "The Flying Dutchman" is both the name of a [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters|pirate ghost]] (a flying Dutchman) and his haunted pirate ship (''The Flying Dutchman'') in the [[Nickelodeon]] animated comedy series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. The former is voiced by [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], and the latter is based on [[Queen Anne's Revenge]].
* [[Carl Barks]] wrote and drew a 1959 comic book story where [[Uncle Scrooge]], [[Donald Duck]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] meet the ''Flying Dutchman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Uncle Scrooge – The Flying Dutchman |author=Carl Barks |authorlink=Carl Barks |url=http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=W+US+++25-02 |date=March 1959 |accessdate=2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barks ultimately explains the "flying" ship as an optical illusion.
* In [[Eiichiro Oda]]'s [[manga]] ''[[One Piece]]'' as well as the anime television series, Fishman Vander Decken IX (バンダー・デッケン九世, Bandā Dekken Kyūsei) a descendant of the original Captain Vander Decken is the ''Flying Dutchman''{{'}}s current captain who appears as a major villain in the "Fishman Island" arc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ryu-anime.com/anime/watch/subbed/one-piece-episode-526&lt;/ref&gt; Like in the real world, the ''Flying Dutchman'' is feared by sailors in the world of One Piece as a legendary and infamous ghost ship, though in actually it is a pirate ship used by Fishman Vander Decken IX and his crew the Flying Pirates. The original Vander Decken is believed to have murdered his crew and defied the heavens and incurred the wrath of God, while others say it had sunk in a storm, but was cursed to sail his ship until doomsday, however though other than Vander Decken's madness, most of these stories are considered to be myths and in truth Vander Decken came to Fishman Island in search of the legendary Mermaid Princess Poseidon one of the so-called ancient weapons who possesses the power to communicate with Sea Kings, but failed. However Vander Decken IX later discovers the current mermaid princess Shirahoshi possesses this unique ability and becomes obsessed with making her his wife, stalking her using his devil fruit powers. He later enters into an alliance with Hody Jones Captain of the New Fishman Pirates who wishes to takeover Fishman Island to wage war against humanity. However the Straw Hat Pirates defeat the New Fishman Pirates and Vander Decken is arrested and imprisoned. While the ship can never make it to land, Decken is unable to get into contact with the sea.
* In ''[[Soul Eater (manga)|Soul Eater]]'', the Flying Dutchman is the soul of the ghost ship.
* In the 1967 ''[[Spider-Man]]'' [[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|cartoon]] episode "Return of the Flying Dutchman" the legend of the ''Flying Dutchman'' is used by Spider-Man's enemy [[Mysterio]] to frighten villagers and plunder their wealth.
* In 1967, the ''Flying Dutchman'' was featured in the ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]'' episode "Cave of the Dead".
* In a 1976 episode of ''[[Land of the Lost (1974 TV series)|Land of the Lost]]'', the Marshalls discover the captain of a mysterious ship that appears in "the mist". Later in the episode, it is discovered that the ship is the ''Flying Dutchman''.
* In the 1982 ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' episode "A Very Strange Affair; The Sailor", [[Peter Graves]] plays a portrayal of the Flying Dutchman in the hopes of breaking his curse by meeting someone who is willing to die for him.
* On the animated comedy series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Captain Horatio McCallister or just simply the Sea Captain is a sea captain and owner of the Frying Dutchman Restaurant.
* An episode called "The Arrival" (1961, written by Rod Serling) of the television series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' depicts an airplane that arrives at a busy airport. The airplane is discovered to have no crew, passengers, or luggage. At the tail end of the prior episode ("Two"), Rod Serling advertises "The Arrival" as a retelling of the ''Flying Dutchman'' tale. It also gets a mention in the closing narration of the episode "[[Death Ship (The Twilight Zone)|Death Ship]]".
* An episode titled "Lone Survivor" (1971) of the television series ''[[Night Gallery]]'', hosted by [[Rod Serling]], features a shipwrecked survivor who claims he is a type of human Flying Dutchman. He appears to the crews of several famously doomed ships before they sink, including the ''Titanic'', the ''Lusitania'' and the ''Andrea Doria''.
* In the ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' second-season episode "Lost Mariner", the ''Flying Dutchman'' motif is merged into [[Greek mythology]], presenting the wanderer as a hero who offended the sea-god [[Poseidon]].
* In 2001, [[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]] aired a first-season episode "The Mathematics of Tears", in which the Flying Dutchman figured explicitly in the plot.
* In an episode of ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' a ghost ship heralds the death of the victims of a first mate's ghost. The ship is compared to the ''Flying Dutchman'' by one of the characters.
* The pilot of ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]'' (2009) sees the protagonist figure out the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] cannot track a suspect and have given him the nickname "The Dutchman", and a link to the ship is made.

===In film===
The story was dramatised in the 1951 film ''[[Pandora and the Flying Dutchman]]'', starring [[James Mason]] (who plays the Dutch captain Hendrick van der Zee) and [[Ava Gardner]] (who plays Pandora). In this version, the Flying Dutchman is a man, not a ship. The two-hour long film, scripted by its director [[Albert Lewin]], sets the main action on the [[Mediterranean]] coast of [[Spain]] during the summer of 1930. Centuries earlier the Dutchman had killed his wife, wrongly believing her to be unfaithful. Providence condemned him to roam the seas until he found the true meaning of love. In the only plot device taken from earlier versions of the story, once every seven years the Dutchman is allowed ashore for six months to search for a woman who will love him enough to die for him, releasing him from his curse, and he finds her in Pandora.
[[File:Flying Dutchman at Castaway Cay.JPG|thumb|250x250px|Disney's Flying Dutchman prop used in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' moored at Castaway Cay cruise ship terminal]]
In the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' films, the [[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|ship]] made its first appearance in [[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|''Dead Man's Chest'' (2006)]] under the command of the fictional captain, [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]. The story and attributes of the ship were inspired by the actual ''Flying Dutchman'' of nautical lore.

===In literature===

The 1797–98 poem by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', contains a similar account of a ghost ship, which may have been influenced by the tale of the ''Flying Dutchman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Ancient Mariner and the Wandering Jew | journal = Studies in Philology | date = October 1969 | first = O.

Dutch poet [[J. Slauerhoff]] published a number of related poems, particularly in his 1928 volume ''[[Eldorado (poems)|Eldorado]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_roe003195101_01/_roe003195101_01_0079.php|newspaper=Roeping|volume=28|date=1951-1952|title=De vliegende Hollander als antilegende|trans-title=The flying Dutchman as anti-legend|first=H.T.J.|last=Miedema|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uri&gt;{{cite journal|journal=De Nieuwe Taalgids|volume=48|title=De Vliegende Hollander in de nieuwere Nederlandse poezie|trans-title=The Flying Dutchman in the newer Dutch poetry|language=nl|accessdate=25 February 2018|first=S.

This story was adapted in the English [[melodrama]] ''The Flying Dutchman; or the Phantom Ship: a Nautical Drama, in three acts'' (1826){{refn|The 48-page text published c.&amp;nbsp;1829 acknowledges Blackwood's 1821 story as the source, although the two have little in common.|group=nb}} by [[Edward Fitzball]] (1792–1873), music by [[George Rodwell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Rodwell, George Herbert Buonaparte|volume=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the novel ''[[The Phantom Ship]]'' (1839){{refn|Originally published in instalments in the ''[[New Monthly Magazine]]'' (London) March–October 1837, January–February 1838 &amp; February–August 1839 before appearing in book form in 1839. Marryat's gripping story added no new elements to the legend.|group=nb}} by [[Frederick Marryat]]. This in turn was later adapted as ''Het Vliegend Schip'' (''The Flying Ship'') by the Dutch clergyman, A. H. C. Römer. In Marryat's version, [[Terneuzen]], in the [[Netherlands]], is described as the home of the captain, who is called "Van der Decken" ("of the decks").

Another adaptation was ''The Flying Dutchman on Tappan Sea'' by [[Washington Irving]] (1855), in which the captain is named Ramhout van Dam. Irving had already used the story (based on Moore's poem) in his ''Bracebridge Hall'' (1822). Hedvig Ekdal describes visions of the ''Flying Dutchman'' from the books she reads in the attic in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884).

[[John Boyle O'Reilly]]'s ''The Flying Dutchman'' was first published in ''[[The Wild Goose]]'', a handwritten newspaper produced by [[Fenian]] convicts being transported to [[Western Australia]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=The Flying Dutchman (O'Reilly)|last=O'Reilly|first=John Boyle|year=1867|publisher=|page=10 (Christmas Number)|wspage=59|scan=Index:The Wild Goose.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Death Ship'', by [[William Clark Russell|W. Clark Russell]], was published in 1888. It is narrated by Geoffrey Fenton, descendent of [[Edward Fenton]], second mate of the English ship ''Saracen'' on a voyage to the East Indies in 1796. Fenton's ship encounters the ''Flying Dutchman'', and an accident leaves him stranded aboard the cursed ship with her ghostly crew. The captain, Cornelius Vanderdecken, tells Fenton that his ship, the ''Braave'', sailed from [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in 1653. 

{{quote|I looked at him as closely as I durst. His eyes were extraordinarily piercing and passionate, with the cruel brilliance in them such as may be noticed in the insane; the lower part of his face was hidden in hair, but the skin of as much of it as was visible, for his cap was dragged low down upon his brows, was pale, of a haggard sallowness, expressed best in paintings of the dead where time has produced the original whiteness of the pigment. It was impossible that I should have observed this in him in the mani-coloured lamplight of the preceding night. Yet did not his graveyard complexion detract from the majesty and imperiousness of his mien and port. I could readily conceive that the defiance of his heart would be hell-like in obstinacy, and that here was a man whose pride and passions would qualify him for a foremost place among the most daring of those fallen spirits of whom our glorious poet has written.}}

British author [[Brian Jacques]] wrote a trilogy of fantasy/young adult novels concerning two reluctant members of the ''Dutchman''{{'}}s crew, a young boy and his dog, who were swept off the ship by a wave on the night the ship was cursed; however, the same angel who pronounced the curse on the ship and crew appeared to them and blessed them, charging them to help those in need . The first novel was titled ''[[Castaways of the Flying Dutchman]]'' and was first published by [[Puffin Books]] in 2001. The second was titled ''[[The Angel's Command]]'' and was released by Puffin in 2003. The third and final book of the trilogy (due to Jacques' death in 2011) was titled ''[[Voyage of Slaves]]'' and was released by Puffin in 2006.

In the novel ''The Flying Dutchman'' (2013) by the Russian novelist [[Anatoly Kudryavitsky]], the ghost ship rebuilds itself from an old barge abandoned on the bank of a big Russian river, and offers itself as a refuge to a persecuted [[musicologist]].

The comic fantasy ''[[Flying Dutch]]'' by [[Tom Holt]] is a version of the ''Flying Dutchman'' story. In this version, the Dutchman is not a ghost ship but crewed by immortals who can only visit land once every seven years when the unbearable smell that is a side-effect of the [[elixir of life]] wears off.

The Roger Zelazny short story "And Only I Am Escaped To Tell thee" tells of a sailor who escapes from the ''Flying Dutchman'' and is rescued by sailors who welcome him to the [[Mary Celeste]].
[[File:Wagner - Der fliegende Holländer - Maurice Renaud as the Dutchman - Berger - The Victrola book of the opera.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[Richard Wagner]]'s Opera [[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|''Der fliegende Holländer'']] ]]
[[Ward Moore]] in his 1951 story "Flying Dutchman"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Seed|title=American Science Fiction and the Cold War: Literature and Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DTHfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT126|date=31 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-95382-9|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the myth as a metaphor for an automated bomber plane which continues to fly over an Earth where humanity long since totally destroyed itself and all life in a [[nuclear war]].

Amiri Baraka's 1964 play, [[Dutchman (play)|''Dutchman'']], uses the metaphor of ship-lost-at-sea to express the way White liberal America has alienated African Americans in their own country.

===In opera and theatre===
[[Richard Wagner]]'s opera, ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' (1843) is adapted from an episode in [[Heinrich Heine]]'s satirical novel ''The Memoirs of Mister von Schnabelewopski'' (''Aus den Memoiren des Herrn von Schnabelewopski'') (1833), in which a character attends a theatrical performance of ''The Flying Dutchman'' in [[Amsterdam]]. Heine had first briefly used the legend in his ''Reisebilder: Die Nordsee'' (''Pictures of Travel: the North Sea'') (1826), which simply repeats from ''Blackwood's Magazine'' the features of the vessel being seen in a storm and sending letters addressed to persons long since dead. In his 1833 elaboration, it was once thought that it may have been based on Fitzball's play, which was playing at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in London, but the run had ended on 7 April 1827 and Heine did not arrive in London until the 14th.{{refn|The play was not published until its revival in 1829. On all these points see ''Musical Times'' (London), March 1986, p. 133.|group=nb}} Heine was the first author to introduce the chance of salvation through a woman's devotion and the opportunity to set foot on land every seven years to seek a faithful wife. This imaginary play, unlike Fitzball's play, which has the [[Cape of Good Hope]] location, in Heine's account is transferred to the [[North Sea]] off [[Scotland]]. Wagner's opera was similarly planned to take place off the coast of Scotland, although during the final rehearsals he transferred the action to another part of the North Sea, off [[Norway]].

[[Pierre-Louis Dietsch]] composed an opera ''Le vaisseau fantôme, ou Le maudit des mers'' ("The Phantom Ship, or The Accursed of the Sea"), which was first performed on 9 November 1842 at the [[Paris Opera]]. The libretto by [[Paul Foucher]] and H. Révoil was based on Walter Scott's ''[[The Pirate (novel)|The Pirate]]'' as well as Captain Marryat's ''[[The Phantom Ship]]'' and other sources, although Wagner thought it was based on the scenario of his own opera, which he had just sold to the Opera. The similarity of Dietsch's opera to Wagner's is slight, although Wagner's assertion is often repeated. Berlioz thought ''Le vaisseau fantôme'' too solemn, but other reviewers were more favourable.&lt;ref name="NGO"&gt;Cooper &amp; Millington 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;Cooper &amp; Millington 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amiri Baraka]] (formerly LeRoi Jones) wrote the play ''[[Dutchman (play)|Dutchman]]'' in 1964.  The play's abstract nature makes it difficult to draw a direct correlation between it and the myth, but its emphasis on fate and doom recasts themes of the legend in terms of race relations in the contemporary United States.

===In music===

The [[Constitution of Kuwait|Constitution]] provides for [[freedom of religious practice|religious freedom]]. The constitution of Kuwait provides for absolute freedom of belief and for freedom of religious practice. The constitution stated that [[Islam]] is the [[state religion]] and that [[Sharia]] is a source of legislation. In general, citizens were open and tolerant of other religious groups. Regional events contributed to increased sectarian tensions between [[Sunnis]] and [[Shia]].

==Religious demography==
{{Main|Religion in Kuwait}}
There are 1.2 million citizens and 2.6 million non-citizens. In 2001, there were 1125,000 Sunni Kuwaiti citizens, 130,000 Shia Kuwaiti citizens and 920,000 Kuwaiti citizens in total thus Sunnis formed 84% and Shias formed 13.5% of the Kuwaiti citizen population.&lt;ref name=irfr&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2001/5593.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report |work=[[US State Department]]|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[US Department of State]] reported that Shia Kuwaitis formed 10%-15% of Kuwait's citizen population,&lt;ref name=irfr2002/&gt; noting there were 525,000 Sunni Kuwaiti citizens and 855,000 Kuwaiti citizens in total (87% Sunnis, 13% Shias).&lt;ref name=irfr2002&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2002/14005.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report |work=[[US State Department]] |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, there were 600,000 Sunni Kuwaitis citizens, 300,000-350,000 Shia Kuwaiti citizens and 913,000 Kuwaiti citizens in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/416ce9e111.html |title=International Religious Freedom Report |work=[[US State Department]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a small number of [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] Muslims in Kuwait.

There are also Christian Kuwaiti citizens. There are between 200 and 400 Christian Kuwaiti citizens.&lt;ref name=ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refworld.org/country,,,ANNUALREPORT,KWT,,3ae6a88954,0.html |title=International Religious Freedom Report |work=[[US State Department]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, there were 259 Christian Kuwaiti citizens residing in Kuwait.&lt;ref name=rel&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stat.paci.gov.kw/arabicreports/#DataTabPlace:ColumnChartEduAge |title=Nationality By Religion and Nationality|work=Government of Kuwait|language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a small number of [[Bahai]] Kuwaiti citizens. An estimated 150,000 noncitizen residents are Shia. While some areas have relatively high concentrations of either Sunnis or Shia, most areas are religiously well integrated.

There are an estimated 600,000 non-citizen [[Hindus]]. The non‑citizen Christian population is estimated to be more than 450,000. The government-recognized Christian churches include the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], the National Evangelical Church Kuwait (Protestant), the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]], the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] (referred to in Arabic as the Roman Orthodox Church), the Greek Catholic ([[Melkite]]) Church, and the [[Anglican Church]]. There are also many unrecognized Christian religious groups with smaller populations. There are an estimated 100,000 [[Buddhists]], 10,000 [[Sikhs]], and 400 Bahais, the majority of whom are non-citizens.

==Status of religious freedom==

===Legal and policy framework===
The constitution provides for religious freedom. The constitution provides for "absolute freedom" of belief and for freedom of religious practice. The constitution states that Islam is the state religion.

The law requires jail terms for journalists convicted of defaming any religion and prohibits denigration of Islam and [[Judeo-Christian]] religious figures, including [[Muhammad]] and [[Jesus]]. The law prohibits publications that the government deems could create hatred, spread dissension among the public, or incite persons to commit crimes.

The government has Islamic [[religion studies]] in public schools for all students. Non-Muslim students are not required to attend these classes. High school Islamic education textbooks are based largely on the Sunni interpretation of Islam.

The government does not designate religion on passports or national identity documents, with the exception of birth certificates. On birth certificates issued to Muslims, the government does not differentiate between Sunnis and Shia.

The [[Kuwait Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs|Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs]] is officially responsible for overseeing religious groups. The procedures for registering and licensing religious groups are similar to those for [[NGO]]s. There are seven officially recognized churches: the National Evangelical, Catholic, Coptic Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic, and Anglican churches. They work with a variety of government entities in conducting their affairs. These include the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor for visas and residence permits for clergy and other staff, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Municipality of Kuwait for building permits and land concerns, and the Ministry of Interior for security and police protection of places of worship. The government imposes quotas on the number of clergy and staff officially recognized religious groups can bring into the country.

Religious courts administer personal status law. Shia Muslims follow their own jurisprudence in matters of personal status and family law at the first instance and appellate levels. In 2003 the government approved a Shia request to establish a [[court of cassation]] to oversee Shia personal status issues. The court is not yet established. An independent [[Waqf|Islamic charity]] administers Shia religious endowments.

===Government Practices===
Government restrictions primarily affected non-Sunni citizens and residents. Municipal authorities became more active in obstructing religious gatherings at unofficial, private spaces.

Kuwait does not have Shia religious training institutions for clergy. Kuwaiti Shias who wanted to serve as [[imam]]s had to seek training and education abroad (primarily in [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], and to a lesser degree [[Syria]]) due to the lack of Shia jurisprudence courses at [[Kuwait University | Kuwait University's]] College of Islamic Law, the country's only institution to train imams.

The government exercised direct control of Sunni religious institutions. The government appointed Sunni imams, monitored their Friday sermons, and financed construction of Sunni mosques. In some instances, Sunni imams were suspended for delivering sermons whose content the government deemed inflammatory. The government did not exert this control over Shia mosques, which the Shia community, not the government, funded.

Shia worshipers gathered peacefully in public spaces to attend sermons and eulogies during [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] and the government provided security to Shia neighborhoods. However, the government did not permit [[self-flagellation]] (public reenactments) of the martyrdom of [[Hussein ibn Ali|Hussein]].

While seven Christian churches were legally recognized, others were not, including the Indian Orthodox, Mar Thoma, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‑day Saints (Mormons), and Seventh-day Adventist Church. These religious groups freely operated in rented villas, private homes, or the facilities of recognized churches. Members of these congregations reported that they were able to worship without government interference provided they did not disturb their neighbors or violate laws.

Shia were represented in the police force and some branches of the military/security apparatus, although not in all branches and often not in leadership positions. Some Shia alleged that a "[[glass ceiling]]" of discrimination prevented them from obtaining leadership positions in some of these organizations. However, since 2006 the prime minister has appointed two Shia ministers to each cabinet, including the current one. The emir had several senior-level Shia advisors.

==Status of Societal Respect for Religious Freedom==
Many hotels, stores, and other businesses patronized by both citizens and non-citizens openly acknowledged non-Muslim holidays such as Christmas, Easter, and Diwali. During the Christmas season, stores, malls, and homes were decorated with Christmas trees and lights, and Christmas music, including songs with explicitly Christian lyrics, was broadcast in public spaces and on the radio. Christian holiday decorations were widely available for purchase. None of the many stores that had Christmas-themed displays reported negative incidents. The news media regularly printed reports of religious holiday celebrations, including large supplement sections detailing the religious significance of Christmas.

The [[Constitution of the Central African Republic|Constitution]] provides for [[freedom of religion]], although it prohibits what the Government considers to be religious fundamentalism or intolerance and establishes fixed legal conditions based on group registration with the [[Ministry of Interior (Central African Republic)|Ministry of Interior]]. The Government generally respected the right to religious freedom in practice; however, [[witchcraft]] is a criminal offense under the penal code. Private actors continued to abuse and discriminate against those accused of witchcraft.

==Religious demography==
{{main|Religion in the Central African Republic}}
The country has an area of approximately {{convert|242000|sqmi|km2}} and a population of 4,369,000. According to a 2005 census report, [[Protestants]] compose 51 percent of the population, [[Catholics]] 29 percent, and [[Muslims]] 10 percent. The remainder of the population practices traditional beliefs ([[animism]]), although many traditional beliefs are also incorporated into [[Christian]] and Islamic practice throughout the country.

In general, immigrants and foreign nationals in the country who practice a particular religion characterize themselves as Catholic, Protestant, or Muslim.

There were many foreign missionary groups operating in the country. Many missionaries who left the country due to fighting between rebel and government forces in 2002 and 2003 returned to the country and resumed their activities.

==Status of religious freedom==

===Legal and policy framework===
The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally permitted adherents of all religious groups to worship without interference. The Constitution prohibits what the Government considers to be religious fundamentalism or intolerance. The constitutional provision prohibiting religious fundamentalism was widely perceived as targeting Muslims; however, it is not supported by any additional legislation.

Although [[witchcraft]] or sorcery is a criminal offense punishable by execution under the penal code, most sentences are from 1 to 5 years in prison or a fine of up to $1,500 (817,836 CFA francs). No one accused of witchcraft received the death penalty during the reporting period, but numerous individuals were arrested for these practices, often in conjunction with some other offense, such as murder. Accusations of witchcraft appear unrelated to religious practice and are often associated with interpersonal disputes. The Government reinforces societal attitudes about the efficacy of sorcery by arresting and detaining persons accused of witchcraft, often under the guise of protecting the accused from harm by people within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/wcaro/english/4501_5144.html |title=UNICEF WCARO - Media Centre - Central African Republic: Children, not witches |publisher=Unicef.org |date=2009-05-04 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green |first=Emma |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/06/hex-appeal/308103/ |title=Hex Appeal - Graeme Wood |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2010-05-11 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a typical trial of someone accused of sorcery, traditional doctors and neighbors are called as witnesses, and cuttings of clothes are submitted as evidence. In the past, the [[Ministry of Justice (Central African Republic)|Minister of Justice]] acknowledged that investigations into allegations of sorcery were difficult. Authorities free most people imprisoned for witchcraft and sorcery offenses for lack of evidence; however, government authorities in May 2007 identified 8–10 inmates as being imprisoned for witchcraft in [[Bimbo]], the women's prison in [[Bangui]].

Religious groups that the Government considered "subversive", a term not specifically defined by the Government, are subject to sanctions by the Ministry of Interior. When imposing sanctions, the Ministry of Interior may decline to register, suspend the operations of, or ban any organization that it deems offensive to public morals or likely to disturb the peace. The Ministry of Interior may also intervene in religious organizations to resolve internal conflicts about property, finances, or leadership within religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green |first=Emma |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/10/when-governments-go-after-witches/280856/ |title=When Governments Go After Witches - Ryan Jacobs |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2013-10-30 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government celebrates several [[Christian holy days]] as national holidays including [[Christmas]], [[Easter Monday]], [[Ascension Day]], the Monday after [[Pentecost]], and [[All Saints' Day]]. The Government does not officially celebrate [[Islamic holy days]]; however, Muslims are allowed to take these days off from work. There is no [[state religion]].

Religious groups (except for traditional indigenous religious groups) are required by law to register with the Ministry of Interior. Registration is free and confers official recognition and certain limited benefits such as customs duty exemption for the importation of vehicles or equipment. The administrative police of the Ministry of Interior monitored groups that failed to register; however, the police did not attempt to impose any penalty on such groups.

Religious organizations and missionary groups are free to proselytize and worship throughout the country.

Students are not compelled to participate in [[religious education]], and they are free to attend any religious program of their choosing. Although the Government does not explicitly prohibit religious instruction in public schools, such instruction is not part of the overall [[State school|public school]] curriculum, nor is it common. Religious instruction is permitted without government interference in private schools. Private Catholic schools generally include 1 hour of religious education per week.

The Government grants religious groups 1 day each week, of their choosing, to make free broadcasts on the official radio station. All religious representatives that wish to broadcast on public airwaves are required to pay a fee when covering certain activities or making religious advertisements. There are four religious broadcasting stations—two Protestant, one Catholic, and one Islamic.

The Government continued to take positive steps to promote religious freedom, such as the organizing of [[interfaith]] services for the purpose of promoting peace and interfaith dialogue.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
Government policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion, with the exception of any practice considered subversive or witchcraft related. The Government continued to ban the [[Unification Church]], claiming that it is a subversive organization likely to disturb the peace because of its alleged training of younger church members as paramilitaries. In December 2006 [[President Bozize]] ordered security forces to burn several houses belonging to deacons of [[Kina Baptist Church]] in Bangui in response to the deacons' burning of a pastor's house following an interpersonal dispute. Security forces arrested two deacons and beat one of them before releasing them.

The Government maintained burdensome legal requirements that restricted the activities of some groups. Two of the churches suspended by the Government in 2003 failed to reopen, unable to prove they had a minimum of one thousand members and church leaders who graduated from what the Government considered high caliber religious schools.

There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.

===Forced religious conversion===
There were no reports of [[forced religious conversion]], including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the [[United States]].

Improvements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom

The Government approved the reopening of a Protestant church in Bangui that had been closed by the Government in March 2006 after authorities learned that two factions within the church were planning to fight each other with knives. The church members later reconciled.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
{{See also|Societal abuse|Religious discrimination}}
Private actors continued to abuse and discriminate against people accused of witchcraft. Although there is widespread belief in the efficacy of sorcery, accusations of witchcraft generally arose from interpersonal disputes, not from specific religious or cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/jul/29/religion-witchcraft-sorcery-africa-unicef |title=Protecting child 'witches' in Africa &amp;#124; Joachim Theis &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-04-15 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witchcraft is widely understood to encompass attempts to harm others not only by magic but also by covert means of established efficacy such as poisons. Although many traditional indigenous religious groups include or accommodate belief in the efficacy of witchcraft, they generally only approve of harmful witchcraft for defensive or retaliatory purposes. Witchcraft was a common explanation for diseases such as [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lucy Jones |url=http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Hundreds-accused-of-witchcraft-in-Central-African-2784381.php |title=Hundreds accused of witchcraft in Central African Republic / But many deaths actually from AIDS |publisher=SFGate |date=2002-08-10 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government authorities sentenced four residents of Bangui's [[Miskine]] suburb to more than 10 years in prison for the 2005 killing of a woman they accused of being a witch. Although courts have tried, convicted, and sentenced some persons for crimes committed against suspected witches in the past, violence against these individuals continued.

'''''Gospel Herald''''' ([[Scottdale, Pennsylvania|Scottdale, PA]]) was the official publication of the [[Mennonite Church (1683–2002)|Mennonite Church]] from 1908-1998.

'''Dr. Henry''' "'''Hank'''" '''Pym''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by editor and plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]] and [[Penciller|penciler]] [[Jack Kirby]],&lt;!--no confirmation of "Marvel Method" being used on pre-superhero Marvel monster stories, historical accounts of which refer to as having full scripts--&gt; the character first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #27 (Jan. 1962). The character, a scientist that debuted in a standalone [[science-fiction]] [[anthology]] story, returned several issues later as the original iteration of the superhero '''[[Ant-Man]]''' with the power to shrink to the size of an [[insect]]. Alongside his crime-fighting partner/wife [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]], he goes on to assume other superhero identities, including the size-changing '''[[Giant-Man]]''' and '''[[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]]'''; the insect-themed '''[[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]]'''; and briefly the '''[[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]'''. He is a founding member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Hank Pym has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[animated films]]; arcade and [[video game]]s; [[television series]] and merchandise such as [[action figures]] and [[trading cards]]. [[Michael Douglas]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], appearing in ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015) and ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018). He will reprise his role in the upcoming [[Untitled Avengers film|untitled ''Avengers'' film]] (2019).

==Publication history==
[[File:TTA-35.jpg|thumb|left|Hank Pym debuts as Ant-Man: ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' #35 (Sept. 1962). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Dick Ayers]].]]
Hank Pym debuted in a seven-page solo cover story titled "The Man in the Ant Hill" (about a character who tests [[wikt:shrink|shrink]]ing technology on himself) in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #27 ([[cover date]] Jan. 1962). The creative team was editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], [[penciler]] [[Jack Kirby]], and [[inker]] [[Dick Ayers]], with Lee stating in 2008: "I did one comic book called 'The Man in the Ant Hill' about a guy who shrunk down and there were ants or bees chasing him. That sold so well that I thought making him into a superhero might be fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=William | last = Keck | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-06-22-marvel-magic_N.htm | title=Here come Marvel's 'Avengers,' and Stan Lee, Joe Simon weigh in | work=[[USA Today]] | date=2008-06-22 | accessdate=2008-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, Pym was revived eight issues later as the costumed [[superhero]] '''Ant-Man''' who starred in the 13-page, three-chapter story "Return of the Ant-Man/An Army of Ants/The Ant-Man’s Revenge" in ''Tales to Astonish'' #35 (Sept. 1962). The character's adventures became an ongoing feature in the title. Issue #44 (June 1963) featured the debut of his [[socialite]] girlfriend and laboratory assistant [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]]. Janet adopted the costumed identity of the Wasp, and co-starred in Pym's subsequent appearances in ''Tales to Astonish''. Wasp also on occasion acted as a framing-sequence host for backup stories in the title. In September 1963, Lee and Kirby created the superhero title ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', and Ant-Man and Wasp were established in issue #1 as founding members of the team.

Decades later, Lee theorized as to why "Ant-Man never became one of our top sellers or had his own book," saying,

{{quote|I loved Ant-Man, but the stories were never really successful. In order for Ant-Man to be successful, he had to be drawn this small next to big things and you would be getting pictures that were visually interesting. The artists who drew him, no matter how much I kept reminding them, they kept forgetting that fact. They would draw him standing on a tabletop and they would draw a heroic-looking guy. I would say, 'Draw a matchbook cover next to him, so we see the difference in size.' But they kept forgetting. So when you would look at the panels, you thought you were looking at a normal guy wearing an underwear costume like all of them. It didn't have the interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Stan Lee: Conversations |  first = Jeff, ed. | last = McLaughlin | publisher = [[University Press of Mississippi]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1578069859 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=zLmB3GprtboC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=%22ant-Man+certainly+wasn't%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RfiZUOT2GuH30gG4uYHgBQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ant-Man%20certainly%20wasn't%22&amp;f=false 186] }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pym began what would be a constant shifting of superhero identities in ''Tales to Astonish'', becoming the {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall '''Giant-Man''' in issue #49 (Nov. 1963). Pym and van Dyne continued to costar in the title until issue #69 (July 1965), while simultaneously appearing in ''The Avengers'' until issue #15 (April 1965), after which the couple temporarily left the team.

Pym rejoined the Avengers and adopted the new identity '''Goliath''' in ''Avengers'' #28 (May 1966). Gradually falling to mental strain, he adopted the fourth superhero identity '''Yellowjacket''' in issue #59 (Dec. 1968). Pym reappeared as Ant-Man in ''Avengers'' #93 (Nov. 1971) and for issues #4–10 starred in the lead story of the first volume of ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' (July 1972 – July 1973). During this run he appeared in a redesigned costume with a [[Nail (fastener)|nail]] as a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cassell|first=Dewey |title=Marvel Feature|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|pages=15–17|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; After appearing occasionally as Yellowjacket in the 1980s and battling mental and emotional issues, Pym would temporarily abandon a costumed persona. Pym joined the [[West Coast Avengers]] as a scientist and inventor in ''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #21 (June 1987). &lt;!--Vol. 1 was 1984 miniseries--&gt; The character returned to the Avengers as the superhero Giant-Man in ''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #1 (Feb. 1998). When the team disbanded after a series of tragedies, Pym, using the Yellowjacket persona again, took a leave of absence beginning with vol. 3, #85 (Sept. 2004).&lt;ref&gt;The issue was alternately numbered #500 (of the first volume) in an anniversary return to the original series numbering.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of van Dyne, a grieving Pym took on yet another superhero identity as the new iteration of '''Wasp''', in tribute to the woman he had married and divorced by this time, in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] publication ''[[Secret Invasion|Secret Invasion: Requiem]]'' (Jan. 2009). Giant-Man appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' from issue #1 (Aug. 2010) through its final issue #39 (Jan. 2013).  Pym returned as the Wasp in the mini-series ''Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp'' (Jan. 2011), and also appeared as a regular character in the 2010-2013 ''Secret Avengers'' series, from issue #22 (April 2012) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).

After ''Secret Avengers'', Pym joined the ''Avengers A.I.'' after beating his creation, [[Ultron]]. Then, he appeared in many comic books like ''Daredevil'' (Vol. 3 and 4) and the graphic novel ''Rage of Ultron''.

==Fictional character biography==

=== 1960s ===
[[File:TalesToAstonish56.jpg|thumb|left|Hank Pym as Giant-Man in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #56 (June 1964). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Chic Stone]].]]
[[Biochemist]] Dr. Henry "Hank" Pym discovers an unusual set of [[subatomic particles]] he labels "Pym particles". Entrapping these within two separate serums, he creates a size-altering formula and a reversal formula, testing them on himself. Reduced to the size of an insect, he becomes trapped in an [[anthill]] before he eventually escapes and uses the reversal formula to restore himself to his normal size. Deciding the serums are too dangerous to exist, he destroys them.&lt;ref name="Origin"&gt;''Tales to Astonish'' #27 (Jan. 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, he reconsiders his decision and recreates his serums. Pym's experience in the anthill inspires him to study ants, and he constructs a [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] helmet that allows him to communicate with and control them. Pym designs a costume made of [[unstable molecules]] to prevent bites or scratches from the ants, and reinvents himself as the superhero Ant-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''Tales to Astonish'' #35 (Sept. 1962)&lt;/ref&gt;
After several adventures, Pym is contacted by Dr. Vernon van Dyne asking for aid in contacting [[Extraterrestrial life|alien life]]. Pym refuses, but is attracted to Vernon’s [[socialite]] daughter Janet van Dyne. Vernon is subsequently killed by an alien criminal who teleports himself to Earth, and Janet asks for Pym's help in avenging Vernon's death. Pym reveals his secret identity to Janet, and uses Pym particles to graft [[wasp]] wings beneath her shoulders, which appear when Janet shrinks. Janet assumes the alias of the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], and together they find and defeat Vernon's killer.&lt;ref&gt;''Tales To Astonish'' #44 (June 1963)&lt;/ref&gt; The pair become founding members of the superhero team known as the Avengers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #1 (Sept. 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pym eventually adopts his first alternate identity as the 12-foot-tall [[Giant-Man]].&lt;ref name="Talesto"&gt;''Tales to Astonish'' #49 (Nov. 1963)&lt;/ref&gt; He and the Wasp develop a romantic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''Tales To Astonish'' #63 (Jan. 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; In comics three decades later, a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] reveals Pym adopted the Giant-Man identity out of feelings of inadequacy when compared to powerful teammates [[Iron Man]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Forever'' #1-12 (Dec. 1998 - Feb. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, Pym and van Dyne take a leave of absence from the Avengers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #15 (Apr. 1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pym adopts the new identity of [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|Goliath]] upon returning.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #28 (May 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; A mishap traps the character in giant form for several issues, and affects his self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #28-35 (May-Dec. 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; After regaining control of his size-shifting ability, Pym creates the [[robot]] [[Ultron]] that accidentally achieves [[sentience]] and becomes one of the Avengers's greatest foes.&lt;ref name="Ultron"&gt;First appearance: ''The Avengers'' #54 (July 1968); origin: ''The Avengers'' (Nov. 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; During a botched experiment, Pym inhales chemicals that induce [[schizophrenia]], and suffering from a personality crisis, reappears at Avengers Mansion as the cocky Yellowjacket, claiming to have disposed of Pym. Only the Wasp realizes it is Pym and takes advantage of his offer of [[marriage]]. Pym eventually recovers from the chemicals during a battle with the [[Circus of Crime]] at the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #59-60 (Dec. 1968 - Jan. 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

After several adventures with the Avengers, including another encounter with Ultron,&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #66-68 (July-Aug. 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; the pair take another leave of absence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #74 (March 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; The heroes reencounter Hank Pym at the beginning of the [[Kree-Skrull War]],&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #90 (July 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; and once again as the Ant-Man persona and has a series of solo adventures.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Feature'' #4-10 (July 1972 - July 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

After aiding fellow superhero team known as the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' #23-25 (May–July 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (May 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; as Yellowjacket, Pym returns to the Avengers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #137 (July 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; He is eventually captured by an upgraded Ultron that [[Brainwashing|brainwashes]] his creator, causing the character to regress to his original Ant-Man costume and personality &amp;mdash; arriving at Avengers Mansion, thinking it to be the very first meeting of the team. Seeing several unfamiliar members, Pym attacks the team until stopped by the Wasp.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #161 - 162 (July-Aug. 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; After Ultron's brainwashing is reversed, Pym rejoins the Avengers as Yellowjacket.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #170 (April 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Pym is forced to briefly leave the team when the roster is restructured by government liaison [[Henry Peter Gyrich]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #181 (March 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also at this time, he noticed [[Scott Lang]]'s theft of the Ant-Man suit. After [[Darren Cross]]'s defeat and aware of Lang's use of the stolen goods, Pym let Lang keep the equipment albeit only to uphold the law.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Premiere'' #47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s ===

Returning 14 issues later,&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #195 (May 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Hank Pym participates in several missions until, after demonstrating hostile behavior toward Janet van Dyne, he attacks a foe from behind once the opponent had ceased fighting. [[Captain America]] suspends Yellowjacket from Avengers duty pending the verdict of a [[court-martial]]. Pym suffers a [[mental breakdown]] and concocts a plan to salvage his credibility by building a robot, Salvation-1, and programming it to launch an attack on the Avengers that he will stop using the robot’s weakness at the critical moment, in hopes of regaining his good standing. The Wasp discovers the plan and begs Pym to stop, whereupon he strikes her. [[Jim Shooter]], the writer of this story, says he intended only that Pym accidentally strike her while gesturing at her dismissively, and that artist Bob Hall misinterpreted the instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jimshooter.com/2011/03/hank-pym-was-not-wife-beater.html | date=March 29, 2011| accessdate= March 6, 2015| title=Hank Pym was Not a Wife-Beater| authorlink=Jim Shooter| first= Jim | last=Shooter| publisher= Jim Shooter official site | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141202175326/http://www.jimshooter.com/2011/03/hank-pym-was-not-wife-beater.html | archivedate= December 2, 2014| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pym is subsequently expelled from the Avengers,&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #212-213 (Oct.-Nov. 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; and Janet divorces him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #214 (Dec. 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

Left penniless, Pym is manipulated by an old foe, the presumed-dead [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]] tricking him into stealing the national reserve of the metal [[adamantium]]. Pym is confronted by the Avengers (whom he had covertly summoned), and after being defeated is blamed for the theft, as Egghead erases all evidence of his involvement. Blaming an ostensibly dead villain is taken as further proof of Pym’s madness and he is incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #217 (March 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; During Pym’s imprisonment, Janet has a brief relationship with Tony Stark.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #224 (Oct. 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; Egghead later involves himself, and while attempting to kill Pym is himself accidentally killed by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] as the latter's brother had been murdered by Egghead years ago. With the real perpetrator exposed, Pym is cleared of all charges. After bidding farewell to Janet and his teammates, Pym leaves to devote his full-time to research.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' #228-230 (Feb.-April 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pym reappears in the [[West Coast Avengers]], first in an advisory role,&lt;ref&gt;''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #1 (Oct. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; and then as a full member in a non-costumed capacity.&lt;ref&gt;''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #21 (June 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; He begins a short relationship with teammate [[Tigra]],&lt;ref&gt;''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #16 (Jan. 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; and after a verbal taunting by old foe [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] contemplates [[suicide]], but is stopped by the heroine [[Firebird (Marvel Comics)|Firebird]].&lt;ref&gt;''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #17 (Feb. 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Pym and Janet eventually resume a romantic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 2, #42 (March 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990s ===
The character eventually returns to the Avengers, joining the East Coast team as Giant-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #368 (Nov. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The pair, together with many of the other Avengers, apparently sacrifice themselves to stop the villain [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], but actually exist in a pocket universe for a year before returning to the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' vol. 2, #1 - 13 (Nov. 1996 - Nov. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hank Pym returns and aids the team as Giant-Man,&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' vol. 3, #1 (Feb. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; and makes a significant contribution by defeating criminal mastermind Imus Champion&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers/Squadron Supreme'' Annual ''98'' (Sept. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; and his flawed creation Ultron, simultaneously overcoming his old issues of guilt over Ultron's crimes &amp;mdash; revealed to be due to him having used his own brain patterns to create Ultron, and so believing that Ultron's attitude reflects his darker side.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #19 - 22 (Aug.-Oct. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
During the [[Avengers Forever|Destiny War]] between [[Kang the Conqueror]] and [[Immortus]], two versions of Hank Pym are drawn in: Giant-Man of the present and Yellowjacket immediately prior to his marriage to Janet van Dyne.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Forever'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; Yellowjacket briefly betrays the team to Immortus and the powerful Time-Keepers try to create a timeline where he will not turn back into Pym,&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Forever'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; but he rejects this decision in time to help his allies.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Forever'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; Observing the final battle, [[Libra (Marvel Comics)|Libra]] - who brought the team together by using the [[Destiny Force]] to tap into his subconscious awareness of the cosmic balance - reflects that both Pyms were necessary so that Yellowjacket's betrayal could bring the team into the right position to attack the Time-Keepers, while Pym's presence as Giant-Man both provided a stable support and irritated Yellowjacket to provoke his own actions.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Forever'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in the present, an encounter with [[Kulan Gath]] results in Pym being split into his two personas of Pym and Yellowjacket, after a spell cast by Gath temporarily transforms Pym into a swashbuckler-style Yellowjacket, followed by the Yellowjacket persona manifesting a physical presence from the extradimensional bio-mass Pym uses to grow. After the Giant-Man Pym spends some time appearing almost emotionally stunted, reciting facts with no sense of emotional depth even when facing the new threat of a supercharged [[Count Nefaria]], the Yellowjacket Pym replaces him, only for his impulsive nature to making a situation worse when [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]] turns an entire village into variations of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Yellowjacket's plan to stop the Hulks resulting in them merging into one massive Hulk before he can shrink it down to a more manageable level, requiring them to bring in the original Hulk to essentially merge with the other Hulks and force them to split. The two Pyms begin to deteriorate from being apart, but are restored when the Wasp helps the two halves realize they need each other.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Annual'' 2001 (Sept. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Pym is eventually able to resolve his problems and adopts his Yellowjacket persona once again.&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #41 - 55 (June 2001 - Aug. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the events of the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" storyline, Pym takes a leave of absence,&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #85 (Sept. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] title ''Avengers: Finale'', the character and Janet leave for [[England]] to rekindle their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Finale'' #1 (Nov. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Pym and Janet's relationship fails and it is revealed in flashback during the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline that he has been replaced by an alien of the shapeshifting [[Skrull]] race.&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Avengers'' #15 (Aug. 2008); ''Secret Invasion'' #1-8 (June 2008 - Jan. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The impostor Yellowjacket, the Skrull Criti Noll, is a central character in the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, joining those heroes that support the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. At the conclusion of the Civil War, the impostor is named "Man of the Year" by ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' magazine for his role in freeing several captive anti-registration heroes.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War'' #1-7 (June 2006 - Jan. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Noll becomes one of the administrators at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]], a U.S. military base in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], for the training of registered superheroes in the government program The Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Initiative'' #14 (Aug. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; He ends the attempt at reconciliation with Janet and begins a romantic relationship with Tigra before eventually being exposed and defeated by the hero [[Crusader (Aubrey Thompson)|Crusader]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Initiative'' #19 (Jan. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Following a final battle between Earth's heroes and the Skrulls, the real Pym is found with other "replaced" heroes in a Skrull vessel. After Janet is seemingly killed in battle,&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion'' #8 (Dec. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Pym takes on a new superhero persona, the Wasp. in tribute to her.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion: Requiem'' (Jan. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He rejoins the Avengers&lt;ref name="Mighty Avengers' 2009"&gt;''Mighty Avengers'' #21 (Feb. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually leads the team.&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Avengers'' #23 (May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] reveals to Pym that he is Earth's "[[Scientist Supreme]]", the scientific counterpart to Earth's [[Doctor Strange|Sorcerer Supreme]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Avengers'' #30 (Dec. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The Norse trickster-god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] later claims to have been posing as Eternity in order to manipulate Pym.&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Avengers'' #34&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
Hank Pym creates [[Avengers Academy]], a program to help train young people with newly acquired superpowers.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers Academy'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Pym returns to his Giant-Man identity in ''Avengers Academy'' #7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aryes, Tom|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/comics/news/a272645/gage-explains-the-return-of-giant-man.html |title=Gage explains the return of Giant-Man |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pym later joins the superhero team known as the [[Secret Avengers]].&lt;ref&gt;Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Secret Avengers'' #22&lt;/ref&gt; When a future version of Pym's sentient robot [[Ultron]] conquers the world of the present in the "[[Age of Ultron]]" storyline, a time-travel plan involving [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and the Invisible Woman succeeds in having the past Pym make a change in his creation of Ultron, which destroys the robot with a computer virus.&lt;ref&gt;''Age of Ultron'' #5-10 (June- ?? 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pym and [[Monica Chang]], A.I. Division Chief of the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], assemble a new team called the [[Avengers A.I.]], consisting of Pym, [[Victor Mancha]] (his grandson), the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], and a [[Doombot]].&lt;ref&gt;Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''Avengers A.I.'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; The team is later joined by [[Alexis The Protector|Alexis]],&lt;ref name="Avengers A.I. #006"&gt;''Avengers A.I.'' #006&lt;/ref&gt; who is eventually revealed to be one of six sentient A.I.s to be spawned from the Ultron virus along with Dimitrios.&lt;ref name="Avengers A.I. #006"/&gt; Months later, Pym, again using the Yellowjacket identity, is shown as a member of the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Avengers''  vol. 5, #35&lt;/ref&gt; Later, an accident merges Pym and Ultron during Ultron's latest attack. After the hybrid human/machine eventually abandons Earth, a funeral service is held in Pym's honor,&lt;ref name="Rage"&gt;''Avengers: Rage of Ultron'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; and Scott Lang receives one of Hank's labs.&lt;ref&gt;''Ant-Man Annual'' vol. 2, #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Pym/Ultron resurfaces after helping the crew of a spaceship under attack. Ultron is now Pym's armor rather than being merged with him.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers'' vol. 3, #4&lt;/ref&gt; Back on Earth, he rejoins the Avengers, but his teammates and others discover Ultron has gained control and is impersonating Pym.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers'' (Vol 3) #9-10&lt;/ref&gt; The Avengers end up defeating him by plunging him into the sun, but both Hank and Ultron survive and continue to do battle with one another internally.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny Avengers'' (Vol. 3) #12&lt;/ref&gt;

Hank is later revealed to have had a daughter named [[Wasp (comics)#Nadia van Dyne|Nadia]] through his ex-wife Maria Trovaya, and Nadia became the latest Wasp.&lt;ref&gt;''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #9&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, the Ultron/Hank Pym had set up a base in a unidentified forest in Alaska. Upon being alerted by the approach of Sam Wilson's task force by a robot version of Edwin Jarvis, the Ultron/Hank Pym decides to give his "family" a warm welcome.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Empire'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; When Tony Stark A.I.'s team and the Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers alongside Hydra's Avengers confront each other, they are captured by the Ultron/Hank Pym who forces both teams to sit at a dinner table. The Ultron/Hank Pym argues that he is doing this because the Avengers have become less of a family over the years as so many of them jump to obey Captain America or Iron Man despite past experience confirming that this should be a bad idea. The Tony Stark A.I. counters that the only reason the team failed as a family was because of Hank Pym's attack on Wasp. Outraged, the Ultron/Hank Pym nearly attacks the other heroes, but Scott Lang is able to talk him down by arguing that Hank Pym remains his own inspiration. The Ultron/Hank Pym allows the Tony Stark A.I.'s team to leave with the Cosmic Cube fragment, arguing that he will leave Hydra Supreme's plans with Hydra alone as it appears to be the best chance for world peace.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Empire'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

After discovering that the Infinity Stones were reformed back into the Univerve, Ultron/Hank Pym decided to collect them all.&lt;ref&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #150&lt;/ref&gt; He send the aliens he had infected with his virus to take the Space Stone from Wolverine while he himself went to claim the Soul Stone. The aliens eventually failed at their task, but Ultron/Hank Pym was able to steal the Soul Gem from Magus after ruthlessly killing him. However, unbeknownst to Ultron, as he claimed the Soul Stone, the fragment of Hank Pym's soul entered the Soul World where he was greeted by the fragment of Gamora's soul, who revealed to him that he was going to be trapped there forever.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinity Countdown: Prime'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards the fragment of Hank's soul encounters and battles a Soul World monster known as Devondra, that ultimately devoured him, trapping him in the process in a deluding dream which made Hank believe that he had escaped the Soul World and reunited himself with the Avengers.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinity Countdown'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
Hank Pym is a scientific [[genius]] with a [[Ph.D]] in [[biochemistry]] and [[nanotechnology]], and expertise in the fields of [[quantum physics]], [[robotics]]/[[cybernetics]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[entomology]]. Pym discovered the subatomic "Pym particles" that enable mass to be shunted or gained from an alternate dimension, thereby changing the size of himself or other beings or objects.&lt;ref name="Origin"/&gt; Pym is the creator of the robot [[Ultron]], who he created as an experiment after examining [[Dragon Man]], showing his knack for AI and Cybernetics.&lt;ref name="Ultron" /&gt;

After constant experimentation with size-changing via ingested capsules and particle-filled gas, Pym is eventually able to change size at will,{{issue|date=May 2015}} and mentally generate Pym particles to change the sizes of other living beings or inanimate objects.{{issue|date=May 2015}} Pym retains his normal strength when "ant" size, and possesses greatly increased strength and stamina when in "giant" form, courtesy of the increased mass. Pym's costume is synthetic stretch fabric composed of [[unstable molecules]] and automatically adapts to his shifting sizes.

Pym also uses a cybernetic helmet he created for achieving rudimentary communication with ants and other higher order insects. As Yellowjacket, then later as Wasp, Pym wears artificial wings and has bio-blasters called "stingers" built into his gloves. He took up the Wasp mantle in memory of Janet, who was believed to be dead at the time.&lt;ref name="Mighty Avengers' 2009"/&gt;

Pym also carries a variety of weaponry, provisions, and scientific instruments, which are shrunken to the size of microchips and stored in the pockets of his uniform.{{issue|date=April 2014}}

During his stay with the [[West Coast Avengers]], Pym constructed a one-man-vehicle with artificial intelligence named ''Rover''.{{issue|date=August 2017}} Rover is able to communicate with Pym, and is capable of flight and discharging energy and acid.

Back with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] main-team, he built a second Rover, resembling an [[Avengers Quinjet]].{{issue|date=August 2017}}

After fusing with Ultron, he now contains all of his [[Ultron#Powers and abilities|creation's abilities]] when he is in control.&lt;ref name="Rage"/&gt;

==Successors==
There are a number of characters in the Marvel universe that have also used the "Pym particles" to effect size changing. These include [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]],&lt;ref&gt;''Tales to Astonish'' #44 (June 1963)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]],&lt;ref&gt;Goliath in ''Avengers'' #63–97 (April 1969 – March 1972); ''Avengers'' #345 (March 1992) to ''Captain America'' #401 (June 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]],&lt;ref&gt;''Power Man'' #24 (Apr. 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]],&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Premiere'' #47 (Apr. 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Josten]],&lt;ref&gt;Goliath in ''Iron Man Annual'' #7 (Oct. 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)|Rita DeMara]],&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #264 (Feb. 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cassandra Lang|Cassandra "Cassie" Lang]],&lt;ref&gt;Stature in ''Young Avengers'' #6 (Sept. 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Eric O'Grady]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #1 (Sept. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Goliath (Tom Foster)|Tom Foster]],&lt;ref&gt;Goliath in ''Black Panther'' vol. 3, #23 (Feb. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Raz Malhotra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/marvel-comics-has-a-new-giant-man-and-its-not-hank-pym-1718326582|title=Marvel Comics Has A New Giant Man—And It's Not Hank Pym|first=James|last=Whitbrook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wasp (comics)#Nadia Pym|Nadia Pym]].

After quitting, he retired as Ant-Man and builds his own company Pym Technologies until he is ousted as CEO by his former protege [[Darren Cross]] and his estranged daughter [[Hope van Dyne]]. Although they  still kept an eye on Cross of any suspicious activity, Cross comes close to perfecting Pym's formula and plans to sell the [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]] suit, Pym manipulated former thief [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] into stealing the suit and eventually instructing Scott to be the new [[Ant-Man]] to stop Cross. He refused to have Hope in danger despite his daughter's superior experience, afraid that he would lose Hope like Janet. After discovering that Ant-Man had returned from the Quantum Realm following his fight with Yellowjacket, Pym believes that Wasp is still alive there. In the mid-credits scene, Pym presents an updated Wasp costume to Hope, deciding to give it to his daughter.

===Novel===
Hank Pym appears in the novelization of ''[[Spider-Man 2]]''. It's him instead of a nameless female scientist who asks [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Octo Octavius]] how he plans to control his metallic tentacles.

After the failure of Octavius' experiment, Pym goes over to Otto to confirm he's alive, while implying that his wife Rosalie is dead. Additionally, Octavius described Pym as being a giant in a field where everyone else are ants.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man 2'' Novelization Pages 113-114 and 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Heimia''''' is a genus of [[flowering plant]]s in the [[Lythrum|loosestrife]] family, [[Lythraceae]]. It contains two or three species of closely related [[shrub]]s commonly known as '''sun opener''' or '''shrubby yellowcrest'''. They are native to the [[Americas]], from northern [[Argentina]] north to the southernmost [[United States]] (southern [[Texas]]). The [[leaf|leaves]] are 2&amp;ndash;5&amp;nbsp;cm long and 1&amp;nbsp;cm broad, entire, and variably arranged alternate, opposite or whorled on the stems. All species produce five-petaled yellow flowers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The plants have a history of [[Ethnopharmacology|medicinal use]] in a variety of [[Americas|American]] cultures. Several pharmacologically active alkaloids have been detected in the plants.&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt; The generic names honours German physician [[Ernst Ludwig Heim]] (1747–1834).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJ6PyhVuecwC |title=The Names of Plants |first=D. |last=Gledhill |edition=4 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-86645-3 |year=2008 |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species==

The genus contains three species. They are similar to the extent that expert knowledge is required to differentiate between specimens of the different species.&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt; The alkaloid contents of specimens of all three species has been studied, and although similar, they have been found to be chemically distinct.&lt;ref name="Rother1990"&gt;{{cite journal |first=A |last=Rother|title=Alkaloids of ''Heimia montana''|journal=[[Phytochemistry (journal)|Phytochemistry]]|year=1990 |volume=29|pages=1683&amp;ndash;1686 |doi=10.1016/0031-9422(90)80146-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

''[[Heimia myrtifolia]]'' and ''[[Heimia salicifolia]]'' are often reported to have [[hallucinogen]]ic effects. This controversial attribution of effects appears to be traceable back to a publication by J. B. Calderón in 1896 who wrote that it was said to possess a "curious and unique physiological action ... people drinking either a [[decoction]] or the juice of the plant have a pleasant drunkenness ... all objects appear yellow and the sounds of bells, human voices or any other reach their ears as if coming from a long distance."&lt;ref name="Malone"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 7934084|doi=10.1016/0378-8741(94)90080-9 | volume=42 | title=Heimia salicifolia: a phytochemical and phytopharmacologic review | date=May 1994 | journal=J Ethnopharmacol | pages=135–59 | last1 = Malone | first1 = MH | last2 = Rother | first2 = A}}[http://erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?A=ShowDoc1&amp;ID=6470 Erowid references]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calderon"&gt;Estudio sobre el arbusto llamado sinieuichi. ''[[Anales del Instituto Médico Nacional]]'' '''2''', 36&amp;ndash;42&lt;/ref&gt;

Calderón actually tested the plant and did not experience any noticeable effects. Through a series of exaggerating and dramatizing citations, especially by [[Victor A. Reko]] in the first half of the last century, the plant became known as a hallucinogen despite that psychoactive properties of the plant have never been demonstrated. The mildly psychoactive effects described in the original publication have therefore been attributed to a sedative principle or unknown other contents of the brew or, simply, to its [[ethanol|alcohol]] content.&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt;

In 1926, Reko observed that the native people of [[Mexico]] also called the stem and bark of ''[[Erythrina coralloides]]'', the bark of ''[[Piscidia erythrina]]'', and the seeds of ''[[Rhynochosia praecatoria]]'' by the name of ''sinicuichi'',&lt;ref name="Reko"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Victor A |last=Reko|title=Sinicuichi |journal=[[La Revista Médica de Yucatan]]|year=1926 |volume=14|pages=22&amp;ndash;27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may have contributed to the scientific confusion.&lt;ref name="Malone"/&gt;

==Cultivation==

[[Image:Heimia Salicifolia Seeds.jpg|right|thumb|Seeds of ''H. salicifolia'']]
{{Howto|date=March 2010}}
The species make attractive [[ornamental plant]]s, flowering in late summer. Although only growing as a [[shrub]] in subtropical climates, it can also be grown as a [[Perennial plant|herbaceous perennial]] in colder areas where the above-ground growth is killed by winter cold. The plants produce very many tiny seeds which are easily cultivated. The seeds should be sown thinly across the top of fine, packed soil.

Both species prefer well-drained soil with a good supply of water. The seedlings should be watered by a fine mist or with bottom watering to avoid washing them off to the side of the pot. They should be kept out of intense sunlight until they form the first real leaves. It may be necessary to spread the seedlings out in their initial pots to avoid over-crowding. The seedlings should be moved to at least an inch apart once they are large enough to handle. Be aware that small seedlings of this species often have relatively large root structures. A plant less than a quarter-inch tall may have roots up to two inches deep.&lt;ref name="Grubber"&gt;{{citation|last=Grubber|first=Hudson|title= Growing the Hallucinogens|url=http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/cultivation/cultivation_growing-the-hallucinogens.shtml#SINICUICHI|year=1976|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Holy Infant of Atocha''' or '''Santo Niño de Atocha'''  is a [[Roman Catholic]] image of the [[Christ Child]] popular among the [[Hispanic]] cultures of Spain, Latin America and the southwestern United States. It is distinctly characterized by a basket he carries, along with a staff, drinking gourd, and a cape affixed to which is a scallop shell, symbol of [[Camino de Santiago|a pilgrimage to Saint James]].

==History==
Devotion to Holy Infant of Atocha originally began as a Marian devotion with a medieval statue of the [[Madonna and Child]] in [[Toledo, Spain]]. According to Juan Javier Pescador, it originally reflected devotions to three different depictions of the Virgin Mary: Our Lady of Atocha, Our Lady of Antigua, and Our Lady of Pregnancies that later coalesced into Our Lady of Atocha.&lt;ref&gt;Pescador, Juan Javier. ''Crossing Borders with Santo Niño de Atocha'', University of New Mexico Press (2009), {{ISBN|978-0826347091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of the Divine Child was detachable, and devout families would often borrow the image of the infant when a woman was about to give birth to her child.&lt;ref name=nino&gt;[http://ninoatocha.com/history.html "History", El Santo Niño de Atocha]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, Spain was under [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule]]. The town of [[Atocha (Madrid)|Atocha]], now part of Madrid's [[Arganzuela]] district, was lost to the [[Muslims]], and many Christians there were taken prisoners as spoils of war. The Christian prisoners were not fed by the jailers, but by family members who brought them food. According to pious legend, the caliph ordered that only children under the age of 12 were permitted to bring food. Conditions became increasingly difficult for those men without small children. The women of Atocha prayed before the statue of Our Lady of Atocha at a nearby parish, a title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], to ask her son [[Jesus]] for help.&lt;ref name=nino/&gt;

Reports soon began among the people of Atocha that an unknown child under the age of twelve and dressed in pilgrim's clothing, had begun to bring food to childless prisoners at night. The women of the town returned to Our Lady of Atocha to thank the Virgin for her intercession, and noticed that the shoes worn by the Infant Jesus were tattered and dusty. They replaced the shoes of the Infant Jesus, but these became worn again. The people of Atocha took this as a sign that it was the Infant Jesus who went out every night to help those in need.&lt;ref name=nino/&gt;

==Description==
The Holy Child of Atocha is depicted dressed as a boy pilgrim dressed in a brown cloak with white lace collar over a blue robe.  He wears a brimmed hat with a plume and carries a basket full of bread in one hand and a pilgrim's staff in the other. The pilgrim's staff is often depicted with a water gourd fastened to it. On the cloak he wears a Shell of Saint James, symbol of the pilgrims to the Shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela Cathedral|Santiago de Compostela]] in northwestern Spain. The Child is said to roam the hills and valleys, particularly at night, bringing aid and comfort to the needy, and thereby wearing out his shoes. He is usually shown seated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banderasnews.com/0906/nw-ninoatocha.htm Lazaro, San. "History of El Santo Niño de Atocha", ''Banderas News'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Devotion beyond Atocha==
The Moorish conflict extended well beyond the town of Atocha.  During dire points in their journey, travelers reported that a young boy, dressed as a pilgrim, would come to them bringing food and other necessities.  The boy would often travel with them until they were out of danger and then guide them to the safest roads to reach their destination. Pious legends continued to be developed and the miraculous Child later became considered to be the [[Child Jesus]] and was given the title the ''Holy Child of Atocha''.

===Mexico and New Mexico===
There are two primary shrines to Niño de Atocha: at Fresnillo/Plateros in the state of [[Zacatecas]], Mexico and Chimayo, New Mexico, USA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lYtY62V1FIC&amp;pg=PA1026 Zavaleta, Antonio Noe. "Santo Niño de Atocha", ''Celebrating Latino Folklore'', (Maria Herrera-Sobek ed.) Vol. 3, p. 1027, ABC-CLIO, 2012] {{ISBN|9780313343407}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Mexican Niño de Atocha was installed in the church of Saint Augustine along with the silver Christ in 1554 not long after a silver strike in Plateros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mavcor.yale.edu/conversations/object-narratives/traveling-image-holy-child-atocha-santo-ni-o-de-atocha-plateros Scheper Hughes, Jennifer and Vargas, Daisy. "Traveling Image of the Holy Child of Atocha (Santo Niño de Atocha), Plateros, Mexico", Initiative for the study of Material and Visual Cultures of Religion, Yale University]&lt;/ref&gt;

In those years silver was discovered in '''''[[Fresnillo]]''''' and mines were being opened in the mountains near the settlement. Within a few weeks of the opening of the mine of '''''[[Fresnillo]]''''', there was an explosion and many miners were trapped. The wives of the miners went to the church of St. Augustine to pray for their husbands and noticed that the child on the image of Our Lady of Atocha was missing. At the same time, it was said that a child came to the trapped miners, gave them water and showed them the way out of the mine. Whenever there was a problem at the mine the child helped the miners in need. Each time this happened, the image of the child on the Virgin's arms was found to be dirty and his clothes had little holes in them. After that the Holy Child was taken off his mother's arms and put on a glass box for everyone to see.  The Holy Child of Atocha has become a symbol of [[Zacatecas]] and the protector of miners. Many make pilgrimages to '''''Plateros''''' at Christmas to bring toys to the Holy Child.

===The Philippines===
Holy Infant of Atocha is also popular amongst the mostly [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholic]] [[Filipino people]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/148523/atocha-joins-sto-nino-procession-today-candelaria-fiesta-on-feb-2-philippine-augustinian-province-turns-30 Darang, Josephine. "Atocha joins Sto. Niño procession today", Philippine Daily Inquirer'', January 26, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The local variant, simply known as ''Santo Niño'' (Holy Child), is portrayed very similarly to the Spanish Atocha, except that it is always standing rather than sitting. He bears a staff with an attached bag or basket, which is usually filled with coins or candy, and he dons a pilgrim hat resembling the Atocha image.

The current ''Santo Niño'' found in many Filipino homes is traditionally dressed in either green or red garments. In Filipino [[Folk Catholicism]], red garments are suited for images enshrined at home, while green ones are for those enshrined in business establishments; a common offering to the latter is a bowl filled with coins and sweets. In addition, many Filipinos customarily dress the ''Santo Niño'' in modern attire that reflect their professional roles, such as nurses, doctors, janitors, teachers and policemen, as a means of asking for his patronage. These customs relating to dress are also applied to replicas of the [[Santo Niño de Cebu]], brought by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] to the islands in 1521, and the [[Infant Jesus of Prague]].

==Pop culture and other references==
In the film ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'', Pedro suggests placing [[Santo (art)|santos]] around the hallways of his high school, recommending El Santo Niño de Atocha. He says that his Aunt Concha has seen him.

Holy Infant of Atocha is sometimes associated with the Yoruba orisha [[Eshu]], or Elegua.

This holy infant appears in the 1991 novel ''Mojo and the Pickle Jar'', by Douglas Bell.

In [[Michael Jackson]]'s video for "[[Beat It]]", there is a picture of the Santo Niño above his bed.

On the television sitcom ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]'', the Holy Infant of Atocha is displayed in the family's kitchen.

The Colombian television historical drama ''[[Escobar, el Patrón del Mal]]'' features references to the Holy Infant of Atocha.  The saint is a particular favorite of Pablo Escobar's mother, Enelia Hermilda Gaviria.  She displays a very large portrait of the saint (same as the image above) in her foyer and invokes him in verbal blessings upon her loved ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4977">'''Hubert Jedin''' (17 June 1900, Groß Briesen, [[Friedewalde]], [[Province of Silesia|Silesia]] – 16 July 1980, [[Bonn]]) was a [[Catholic Church]] [[historian]] from [[Germany]], whose publications specialized on the history of [[ecumenical councils]] in general and the [[Council of Trent]] in particular, on which he published a 2400-page history over the years 1951-1975.

==Early years ==
He was born in [[Upper Silesia]] as one of ten children and studied theology in [[Breslau]], [[Munich]] and [[Freiburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Konziliengeschichte 145&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordained in 1924. In 1927 he went to Rome where he completed a biography of [[Girolamo Seripando]]. He returned to Germany in 1930, to teach Church History at the Catholic faculty  of the [[University of Breslau]].&lt;ref&gt;Konziliengeschichte 145&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his [[Jewish]] mother, he was defined half-Jewish by the [[National Socialist]]s. They stripped him of all academic titles  and prohibited him from working in public institutions in Germany. Jedin returned to Rome and worked there for the Görres Society.&lt;ref&gt;Konziliengeschichte 145&lt;/ref&gt; From 1936 until 1939, he worked for his diocese in Breslau. He returned to Rome after narrowly escaping deportation to the [[Concentration Camp]] at [[Buchenwald]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Jedin in Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Council of Trent ==
In Rome, he lived at the [[Collegio Teutonico|Campo Santo Teutonico]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and was thus under the  protection of [[Pope Pius XII]] during the German occupation. He worked on a history of the [[Council of Trent]], which he published in the years 1951-1976.&lt;ref&gt;Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon&lt;/ref&gt;  Jedin created the most comprehensive description  of the Council in his  ''History of the Council of Trent'' (Geschichte des Konzils von Trient with about 2400 pages in four volumes: 
* ''The History of the Council of Trent: The Fight for a Council'' &lt;ref&gt;(Vol I, 1951) Herder Verlag, Freiburg im Breisgau&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''The History of the Council of Trent: The First Sessions in Trent'' 1545-1547 &lt;ref&gt;(Vol II, 1957) Herder Verlag, Freiburg im Breisgau&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''The History of the Council of Trent: Sessions in Bologna 1547-1548 and Trent 1551-1552'' &lt;ref&gt;(Vol III, 1970, 1998) Herder Verlag, Freiburg im Breisgau&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The History of the Council of Trent: Third Period and Conclusion''  &lt;ref&gt;(Vol IV, 1976) Herder Verlag, Freiburg im Breisgau&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vatican Two ==
After the war he was rehabilitated in Germany and accepted a professorship at the [[University of Bonn]] in 1948.  [[Pope John XXIII]] nominated him to assist in the preparation of the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1960. He continued to work for the council until it ended in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Jedin in Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications ==
His work includes over seven-hundred titles, including forty books and 250 articles in journals. Jedin issued numerous publications on the council of Trent, which, in his view, determined the relation of Catholics and Protestants for centuries. He addressed issues of controversy, trying to give interpretations of ecumenical perspectives at that time. In addition, he oversaw the publication of a seven-volume ''Church History'' (1963-1979), an ''Atlas of Church History'' (1979), and the fundamental ''Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche'' (1957-1975, ''Encyclopedia for Theology and the Church''). As a historian, he leaned on [[historicism]] as a method. As a theologian, he was an enlightened conservative, critical of some of the implementations of [[Vatican Two]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Jedin in Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot and description==

The video titled "The Real Life of Muhammad", uploaded on July 1, 2012, has a running time of 13:03 in [[480p]] format. The video "Muhammad Movie Trailer" was uploaded on July 2, 2012, with a running time of 13:51 in [[1080p]] format. They are similar in content.

The trailer starts with a scene portraying the reportedly increasing [[persecution of Copts]] and poor [[human rights in Egypt|human rights]] in recent-day Egypt, with rise in church-burnings, growing religious intolerance and sectarian violence that has been seen against the 10% population of Egypt that are [[Copts]], and complaints that authorities have failed to protect this population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/01/24/egypt-and-libya-year-serious-abuses Egypt and Libya: A Year of Serious Abuses], Human rights watch, January 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MEFa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/3338/egypt-christian-copts-collective-punishment|title=The Collective Punishment of Egypt's Christian Copts|author=Raymond Ibrahim|date=September 6, 2012|publisher=Middle East Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated: "The trailer opens with scenes of Egyptian security forces standing idle as Muslims pillage and burn the homes of Egyptian Christians.

The advertisements were noted by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), whose Islamic affairs director stated, "When we saw the advertisement in the paper, we were interested in knowing if it was some kind of pro-jihadist movie."

===Ninth Circuit court rulings on removal===
{{Main|Garcia v. Google}}
On February 26, 2014, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ordered YouTube to remove the video from its website by a 2-1 majority. The ruling was in response to a complaint by actress Cindy Lee Garcia, who had objected to the use of her performance, which had been partially dubbed for its inclusion in ''Innocence of Muslims''. Garcia had believed during production that she was appearing in a film called ''Desert Warrior'', which was described as a "historical Arabian Desert adventure film", and was unaware that anti-Islamic material would be added at the [[post-production]] stage. Garcia had argued that she held a copyright interest in her performance.&lt;ref name = "court_2014"&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/02/26/uk-google-youtube-film-idUKBREA1P1H920140226 Google ordered to remove anti-Islamic film from YouTube], Reuters, February 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "court_2014_b"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/03/a-controversial-youtube-video-haunts-free-speech-again.html A controversial YouTube video haunts free speech again], The New Yorker, March 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, in an [[en banc]] opinion, the Ninth Circuit reversed the panel's decision, vacating the order for the preliminary injunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chappell |first1=Bill|title=Google Wins Copyright And Speech Case Over 'Innocence Of Muslims' Video |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/18/407732594/google-wins-copyright-and-speech-case-over-innocence-of-muslims-video |accessdate=May 18, 2015 |work=NPR |date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gardner |first1=Eriq |title=Controversial 'Innocence of Muslims' Ruling Reversed By Appeals Court |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/controversial-innocence-muslims-ruling-reversed-796530 |accessdate=May 18, 2015 |work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2015/05/18/12-57302%20EB%20opinion.pdf Garcia v.

A ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article described the video as "Exceptionally amateurish, with disjointed dialogue, jumpy editing, and performances that would have looked melodramatic even in a silent movie, the clip is clearly designed to offend Muslims, portraying Mohammed as a bloodthirsty murderer and [[Lothario]] and [[pedophile]] with omnidirectional sexual appetites."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/12/making-of-innocence-of-muslims|title=The Making of The Innocence of Muslims: Cast Members Discuss the Film That Set Fire to the Arab World|last=Gross|first=Michael Joseph|date=December 27, 2012|work=Vanity Fair|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Justin Trottier''' (born 4 December 1982) is an English-Canadian writer, non-profit executive director and former political candidate. He was one of several founding members of several secular organizations such as the [[Centre for Inquiry Canada]] in 2007, where he served as National Executive Director until 2011. He also founded the Freethought Association of Canada, which created the 2009 [[Atheist Bus Campaign#Canada|atheist bus campaign]] where Trottier served as one of the spokespersons. He also founded the Canadian Secular Alliance. In 2011, he was a [[Green Party of Canada|Green Party]] candidate in the 2011 Ontario provincial election. Later, Trottier co-founded and has served as the chairman and spokesperson for the [[Canadian Association for Equality]] (CAFE), and was heavily involved in CAFE's campaign to open the Canadian Centre for Men and Families in 2014. He currently serves as the Centre's director.

==Early life==

Trottier graduated from the [[University of Toronto]] with a degree in Engineering Science in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lewis | first = Charles | title = The faithful atheist: Speak freely, just don't suggest there's a God | url = http://nationalpost.com/holy-post/justin-trottier-dedicated-atheist-explains-why-blind-faith-can-also-be-crippling | work = [[National Post]]|date=21 July 2012 |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His uncle, [[Lorne Trottier]], is the co-founder of [[Matrox]] computing.

==Atheist activism==

In 2005 Trottier founded the University of Toronto Secular Alliance with Jennie Fiddes. The organization successfully lobbied for the secularization of the University of Toronto's graduation ceremony through the removal of convocation prayers.&lt;ref name="UTGAZETTE"&gt;{{cite web | last = Student writer |url=http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=opinions&amp;articleID=870&amp;month=3&amp;day=15&amp;year=2006 |title=Prayer not necessary |date=15 March 2006 |accessdate=10 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319144359/http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=opinions&amp;articleID=870&amp;month=3&amp;day=15&amp;year=2006 |archivedate=19 March 2012 | work = [[UWO Gazette|The Gazette]] | publisher = [[University of Western Ontario]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, Trottier opened the Secular Freethought Centre, the first community centre in Canada for secular humanists. By January 2007 the Secular Freethought Centre had become the [[Centre for Inquiry Canada]] (CFI) and Trottier was hired as its first Executive Director. CFI currently operates 10 branches in Canada as a national educational charity.  Until 2011, Trottier served as chief spokesperson and led the national office.

In June 2010, Trottier hired [[Nathan Phelps]], the estranged son of Pastor [[Fred Phelps]] of the notoriously anti-gay [[Westboro Baptist Church]], to head up the Calgary, Alberta, branch of the Centre for Inquiry. Trottier's Canadian Campaign for Free Expression sparked the Centre for Inquiry's annual [[Blasphemy Day]].&lt;ref name="THEMARK"&gt;{{cite news | last = Larmondin | first = Leanne |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-10-02-blasphemy-day_N.htm |title=Did you celebrate Blasphemy Day? |work = [[USA Today]] |date=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trottier co-founded the One School System Network which advocates for the defunding of the tax-payer supported Roman Catholic School System in Ontario.&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer |title= One system teaches kids to learn, live together | url = http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=209b64c6-25ea-4902-95d9-d770d2508725&amp;sponsor= |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140812031320/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=209b64c6-25ea-4902-95d9-d770d2508725&amp;sponsor= |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 12 August 2014 |work=[[Windsor Star]] | date = 15 September 2007 |access-date= 9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The One School System Network lobbied against the Conservative Party leader [[John Tory]]'s 2007 election campaign proposal to fund all private faith-based schools in Ontario fully.&lt;ref name="canada2"&gt;{{cite news|last= Staff writer | title = End public funding of religious schools: education activists | url = http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=d6869281-4661-46c9-8cb8-d922d923d926&amp;sponsor= | archive-url = https://archive.is/20140812031318/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=d6869281-4661-46c9-8cb8-d922d923d926&amp;sponsor= |dead-url=yes |archive-date = 12 August 2014 | work = [[National Post]] | date = 21 June 2007 |access-date= 9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014 he filed an affidavit and was granted intervenor status by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on behalf of the Canadian Secular Alliance, in the case of [[Mouvement laïque québécois v Saguenay (City)|Mouvement laïque québécois v Saguenay]], a [[Supreme Court of Canada]] case looking at the constitutionality of government prayer. Atheist Alain Simoneau and the secular rights organization [[Mouvement Laïque Québécois]] had initiated an action before the Quebec Human Rights Tribunal ([[Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse]]) against Jean Tremblay, Mayor of the Quebec town of Saguenay, calling for an end to the practice of the municipal council initiating its city council meetings with a Catholic prayer, on the basis that doing so infringes on freedom of conscience and religion. The Supreme Court unanimously agreed with the plaintiffs, and ordered an end to the practice.

==Atheist bus campaign==

A variety of cities refused to run the ads, although some withdrew their prohibition after a Supreme Court ruling found banning political or controversial ads a violation of the free speech provision in the Canadian constitution.&lt;ref name="XTRA"&gt;{{cite work | last = Xtra.ca staff | title = Transit ad ban violates free expression: Supreme Court | url = http://www.dailyxtra.com/canada/news-and-ideas/news/transit-ad-ban-violates-free-expression-supreme-court-52563 | work = [[Daily Xtra]] | date = 10 July 2009 | accessdate = 16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Atheist bus ads sparked counter campaigns in response, which Trottier publicly supported, including an ad sponsored by Syed Sohawardy of the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada and another by the [[United Church of Canada]].

In April 2009, he was invited to become a contributor to the [[National Post|''National Post'''s]] online Holy Post blog.&lt;ref name="Holy Post blog"&gt;{{cite news|last=Trottier |first=Justin |title=Holy Post (blog)|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/03/09/marginalized-and-on-the-defensive-university-conservatives-forced-to-grow-tougher/|accessdate=17 January 2011|work=[[National Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astronomy==

In 2005, Trottier joined the board of directors of the [[Canadian Space Society]] and had served as the society's external director and as the managing editor of its publication, the ''Canadian Space Gazette''. In 2012 Trottier became the executive producer and host of the Star Spot Radio Show and podcast.&lt;ref name="thevarsity"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ma | first = Emily |title=The Star Spot explores the unknown |url=http://thevarsity.ca/2013/10/21/the-star-spot-explores-the-unknown/ |work=[[The Varsity (newspaper)|The Varsity]] | date = 21 October 2013 |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thestarspot"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thescopeatryerson.ca/en/thescope/shows/217/The-Star-Spot.htm |title=The Star Spot (podcast) |publisher=[[CJRU|The Scope]] | via = [[Ryerson University]]|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is aired on [[CJRU|CJRU The Scope]] at Ryerson University.&lt;ref name="thestarspot" /&gt;

==Gender issues==

In 2011, Trottier became the leader of the Toronto Men’s Issues Awareness Campaign. In an interview with the ''Toronto Star'' about the campaign, Trottier stated that "in gender issues, it’s not as simple as women are always victims and men are always the victimizers," and that "there’s a far more nuanced debate that we should be having." Describing the campaign as "about equality and equalism," Trottier suggested that "for all our talk of equality, it’s ironic that our societal investments have really been on women’s issues."&lt;ref name="Toronto Star Interview"&gt;{{cite news| last = Cribb | first = Robert |url=https://www.thestar.com/living/article/1071379--cribb-men-are-the-new-underclass |title=Cribb: Men are the new underclass | work = [[Toronto Star|thestar.com]] |date= 19 October 2011 |accessdate= 28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

[[File:Tanjore Paintings - Big temple 01.JPG|thumb|right|A painting of Lakshmi on the inner walls of the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple|Tanjore Big temple]].]]

Lakshmi (Lakṣmī) is one of many [[Hindu]] deities whose meaning and significance evolved in ancient Sanskrit texts.&lt;ref name=jmuir&gt;John Muir, {{Google books|ymLZAAAAMAAJ|Original Sanskrit Texts on the Origin and History of the People of India - Their Religions and Institutions|348}}, Volume 5, pp. 348-362 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakshmi is mentioned once in [[Rigveda]], but the context suggests that the word does not mean ''goddess of wealth and fortune,'' rather it means ''kindred mark or sign of auspicious fortune.''&lt;ref name=mmwlak&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/l.html lakṣmī] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520235132/http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/l.html |date=20 May 2015 }}, [[Monier Monier-Williams|Monier-Williams']] ''Sanskrit–English Dictionary'', University of Washington Archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jmuir/&gt;
{{Quote|{{lang-sa2|भद्रैषां '''लक्ष्मी'''र्निहिताधि वाचि}}&lt;br&gt;''{{IAST|bhadraiṣāṁ '''lakṣmī'''rnihitādhi vāci}}&lt;br&gt;"an auspicious fortune is attached to their words"|Rig Veda, x.71.2, Translated by [[John Muir (indologist)|John Muir]]&lt;ref name=jmuir/&gt;}}

In [[Atharvaveda]], transcribed about 1000 BCE, Lakshmi evolves into a complex concept with plural manifestations. Book 7, Chapter 115 of Atharva Veda describes the plurality, asserting that a hundred Lakshmis are born with the body of a mortal at birth, some good, ''punya'' (virtuous) and auspicious, while others bad, ''paapi'' (evil) and unfortunate. The good are welcomed, while the bad urged to leave.&lt;ref name=jmuir/&gt; The concept and spirit of Lakshmi and her association with fortune and the good is significant enough that Atharva Veda mentions it in multiple books: for example, in Book 12, Chapter 5 as ''punya Lakshmi''.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang-sa2|अप क्रामति सूनृता वीर्यं पुन्या लक्ष्मीः}}"; [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/अथर्ववेदः/अथर्ववेद:_काण्डं_12 अथर्ववेद: काण्डं 12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008103125/https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A5%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%83/%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A5%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A6:_%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A3%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%82_12 |date=8 October 2016 }} Atharva Veda Sanskrit Original Archive&lt;/ref&gt; In some chapters of Atharva Veda, Lakshmi connotes the good, an auspicious sign, good luck, good fortune, prosperity, success and happiness.&lt;ref name=mmwlak/&gt;

Later, Lakshmi is referred to as the goddess of fortune, identified with Sri and regarded as wife of {{IAST|Viṣṇu}} ({{IAST|Nārāyaṇa}}).&lt;ref name=mmwlak/&gt; For example, in [[Shatapatha Brahmana]], variously estimated to be composed between 800 BCE and 300 BCE, Sri (Lakshmi) is part of one of many theories, in ancient India, about the creation of universe. In Book 9 of Shatapatha Brahmana, Sri emerges from Prajapati, after his intense meditation on creation of life and nature of universe. Sri is described as beautiful, resplendent and trembling woman at her birth with immense energy and powers.&lt;ref name=jmuir/&gt; The gods were bewitched, desire her and immediately become covetous of her. The gods approach Prajapati and request permission to kill her and then take her powers, talents and gifts. Prajapati refuses, tells the gods that males should not kill females and that they can seek her gifts without violence.&lt;ref&gt;Naama Drury (2010), The Sacrificial Ritual In The Satapatha Brahmana, {{ISBN|978-8120826656}}, pages 61-102&lt;/ref&gt; The gods then approach Lakshmi, deity [[Agni]] gets food, Soma gets kingly authority, [[Varuna]] gets imperial authority, Mitra acquires martial energy, Indra gets force, [[Bṛhaspati|Brihaspati]] gets priestly authority, Savitri acquires dominion, Pushan gets splendour, [[Saraswati]] takes nourishment and Tvashtri gets forms.&lt;ref name=jmuir/&gt; The hymns of Shatapatha Brahmana thus describe Sri as a goddess born with and personifying a diverse range of talents and powers.

According to another legend, she emerges during the creation of universe, floating over the water on the expanded petals of a lotus flower; she is also variously regarded as wife of [[Dharma]], mother of [[Kāma]], sister or mother of {{IAST|Dhātṛ}} and {{IAST|Vidhātṛ}}, wife of Dattatreya, one of the nine Shaktis of {{IAST|Viṣṇu}}, a manifestation of {{IAST|Prakṛti}} as identified with {{IAST|Dākshāyaṇī}} in Bharatasrama and as Sita, wife of Rama.&lt;ref name=mmwlak/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams [https://archive.org/stream/religiousthough00wilgoog#page/n125/mode/2up Religious Thought and Life in India], Part 1, 2nd Edition, pages 103-112&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Epics of Hinduism, such as in [[Mahabharata]], Lakshmi personifies wealth, riches, happiness, loveliness, grace, charm and splendour.&lt;ref name=mmwlak/&gt; In another Hindu legend, about the creation of universe as described in [[Ramayana]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramayana, i.45.40-43&lt;/ref&gt; Lakshmi springs with other precious things from the foam of the ocean of milk when it is churned by the gods and demons for the recovery of {{IAST|Amṛta}}. She appeared with a lotus in her hand and so she is also called Padmā.&lt;ref name=mmwlak/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams [https://archive.org/stream/religiousthough00wilgoog#page/n129/mode/2up Religious Thought and Life in India], Part 1, 2nd Edition, pages 108-111&lt;/ref&gt;

;Root of the word
Lakshmi in [[Sanskrit]] is derived from the root word ''lakṣ'' ({{lang-sa2|लक्ष्}}) and ''lakṣa''({{lang-sa2|लक्ष}}), meaning ''to perceive, observe, know, understand'' and ''goal, aim, objective'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/l.html lakṣ, लक्ष्] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520235132/http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/l.html |date=20 May 2015 }} Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; These roots give Lakshmi the symbolism: know and understand your goal.&lt;ref name=carol&gt;Carol Plum-Ucci, Celebrate Diwali, {{ISBN|978-0766027787}}, pages 79-86&lt;/ref&gt; A related term is ''lakṣaṇa'', which means ''sign, target, aim, symbol, attribute, quality, lucky mark, auspicious opportunity.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/l.html lakṣaṇa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520235132/http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/l.html |date=20 May 2015 }} Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism and iconography==
[[File:North Torana, Sanchi 04.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bas relief of ''Gaja Lakshmi'' at the [[Buddhist]] [[Sanchi]] [[Stupa]], Stupa I, North gateway, [[Satavahana dynasty]] sculpture, 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;The Toranas are dated to the 1st century CE. See: Ornament in Indian Architecture, Margaret Prosser Allen, University of Delaware Press, 1991, p.18 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vyXxEX5PQH8C&amp;pg=PA18]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The image, icons and sculptures of Lakshmi are represented with symbolism. Her name is derived from Sanskrit root words for knowing the goal and understanding the objective.&lt;ref name=carol/&gt; Her four arms are symbolic of the four goals of humanity that are considered good in Hinduism - dharma (pursuit of ethical, moral life), artha (pursuit of wealth, means of life), kama (pursuit of love, emotional fulfillment) and moksha (pursuit of self-knowledge, liberation).&lt;ref name=ttgov/&gt;&lt;ref name=apara&gt;A Parasarthy (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, pages 57-59&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lakshmi's iconography, she is either sitting or standing on a lotus and typically carrying a lotus in one or two hands. The lotus carries symbolic meanings in Hinduism and other Indian traditions. It symbolises knowledge, self-realisation and liberation in Vedic context, and represents reality, consciousness and karma (work, deed) in the Tantra ([[Sahasrara]]) context.&lt;ref name=parasarthy&gt;A Parasarthy (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, pages 91-92, 160-162&lt;/ref&gt; The lotus, a flower that blossoms in clean or dirty water, also symbolises purity regardless of the good or bad circumstances in which its grows. It is a reminder that good and prosperity can bloom and not be affected by evil in one's surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Nathan (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Gibson (2002), Hinduism, Heinemann, {{ISBN|978-0435336196}}, page 29&lt;/ref&gt; Below, behind or on the sides, Lakshmi is sometimes shown with one or two elephants and occasionally with an owl.&lt;ref name=amazzona104/&gt; Elephants symbolise work, activity and strength, as well as water, rain and fertility for abundant prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Hope Werness (2007), Continuum Encyclopedia of Animal Symbolism in World Art, Bloomsbury, {{ISBN|978-0826419132}}, pages 159-167&lt;/ref&gt; The owl signifies the patient striving to observe, see and discover knowledge particularly when surrounded by darkness. As a bird reputedly blinded by daylight, the owl also serves as a symbolic reminder to refrain from blindness and greed after knowledge and wealth has been acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Ajnatanama (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, page 317-318&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gaja Lakshmi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Manuscript painting of Gaja-Lakshmi, ca 1780 AD.]]

In some representations, wealth either symbolically pours out from one of her hands or she simply holds a jar of money. This symbolism has a dual meaning: wealth manifested through Lakshmi means both material as well as spiritual wealth.&lt;ref name=parasarthy/&gt; Her face and open hands are in a mudra that signify compassion, giving or ''daana''(charity).&lt;ref name=apara/&gt;

Lakshmi typically wears a red dress embroidered with golden threads, symbolism for and wealth. She, goddess of wealth and prosperity, is often represented with her husband Vishnu, the god who maintains human life filled with justice and peace. This symbolism implies wealth and prosperity is coupled with maintenance of life, justice, and peace.&lt;ref name=parasarthy/&gt;

==Ancient literature on Lakshmi==
===Upanishads===

Shakta [[Upanishad]]s are dedicated to the trinity ([[Tridevi]]) of goddesses - Lakshmi, [[Saraswati]] and [[Parvati]]. [[Saubhagyalakshmi Upanishad]], describes the qualities, characteristics and powers of Lakshmi.&lt;ref name=mahadeva&gt;A Mahadeva (1950), Saubhagya-Lakshmi Upanishad in The Shakta Upanishads with the Commentary of Sri Upanishad Brahma Yogin, Adyar Library Series No. 10, Madras&lt;/ref&gt; In the second part of the Upanishad, the emphasis shifts to the use of yoga and transcendence from material craving in order to achieve spiritual knowledge and self-realisation, the true wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/saubhagya_sa.html Saubhagya Lakshmi Upanishad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108232748/http://www.sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/saubhagya_sa.html |date=8 November 2014 }} Original text of the Upanishad in Sanskrit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

===Stotrams and sutras===

Numerous ancient [[Stotram]] and [[Sutra]]s of Hinduism recite hymns dedicated to Lakshmi.&lt;ref name=rhodes/&gt; She is a major goddess in [[Purana]]s and [[Itihasa]] of Hinduism. In ancient scriptures of India, all women are declared to be embodiments of Lakshmi.[[File:Hindu Goddess Lakshmi in home temple.jpg|200px|thumb|Hindu Goddess Lakshmi]] For example,&lt;ref name=rhodes/&gt;

{{Quote|Every woman is an embodiment of you. &lt;br&gt; You exist as little girls in their childhood, &lt;br&gt; As young women in their youth &lt;br&gt; And as elderly women in their old age.|Sri Kamala Stotram&lt;ref name=rhodes/&gt;}}
{{Quote|Every woman is an emanation of you.|Sri Daivakrta Laksmi Stotram&lt;ref name=rhodes/&gt;}}

Ancient prayers dedicated to Lakshmi seek both material and spiritual wealth in prayers.&lt;ref&gt;Constantina Rhodes (2011), Invoking Lakshmi: The Goddess of Wealth in Song and Ceremony, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438433202}},&lt;br&gt;Quote: Through illusion, &lt;br&gt; A person can become disconnected, &lt;br&gt; From his higher self, &lt;br&gt; Wandering about from place to place, &lt;br&gt; Bereft of clear thought, &lt;br&gt; Lost in destructive behaviour. &lt;br&gt; It matters not how much truth, &lt;br&gt; May shine forth in the world, &lt;br&gt; Illuminating the entire creation, &lt;br&gt; For one cannot acquire wisdom, &lt;br&gt; Unless it is experienced, &lt;br&gt; Through the opening on the heart.[...]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puranas===

Lakshmi features prominently in [[Purana]]s of Hinduism. Vishnu Purana, in particular, dedicates many sections to her and also refers to her as Sri.&lt;ref name= buitenen/&gt; [[J. A. B. van Buitenen]] translates passages describing Lakshmi in Vishnu Purana as, "Sri, loyal to Vishnu, is the mother of the world. Vishnu is the meaning, Sri is the speech. She is the conduct, he the behavior. Vishnu is knowledge, she the insight. He is dharma, she the virtuous action. She is the earth, he earth's upholder. She is contentment, he the satisfaction. She is wish, he is the desire. Sri is the sky, Vishnu the Self of everything. He is the moon, she the light of moon. He is the ocean, she is the shore".&lt;ref name= buitenen/&gt;

===Subhasita, gnomic and didactic literature===

Lakshmi, along with Parvati and Saraswati, is a subject of extensive [[Subhashita]], gnomic and didactic literature of India.&lt;ref name=ls&gt;Ludwik Sternbach (1974), ''Subhasita, Gnomic and Didactic Literature'', A History of Indian literature, Volume 4, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447015462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed in the 1st millennium BC through the 16th century AD, they are short poems, proverbs, couplets, or [[aphorism]]s in Sanskrit written in a precise meter. They sometimes take the form of dialogue between Lakshmi and Vishnu or highlight the spiritual message in Vedas and ethical maxims from Hindu Epics through Lakshmi.&lt;ref name=ls/&gt; An example Subhashita is ''Puranartha Samgraha'', compiled by Vekataraya in South India, where Lakshmi and Vishnu discuss ''niti''(right, moral conduct) and ''rajaniti''(statesmanship, right governance) - covering in 30 chapters and ethical and moral questions about personal, social and political life.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwik Sternbach (1974), ''Subhasita, Gnomic and Didactic Literature'', A History of Indian literature, Volume 4, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3447015462}}, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manifestations and aspects==

[[File:Vishnu resting on the ocean accompanied by Lakshmi, Tumbara, Wellcome V0045080.jpg|thumb|Vishnu resting on the ocean accompanied by Lakshmi]]

In eastern India, Lakshmi is seen as a form of one goddess [[Devi]], the Supreme power; Devi is also called [[Durga]] or [[Adi Parashakti]]. Lakshmi, [[Saraswati]], and [[Parvati]] are typically conceptualised as distinct in most of India, but in states such as West Bengal and Odisha, they are regionally believed to be forms of Durga.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher John Fuller (2004), The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691120485}}, page 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakshmi is seen in two forms, [[Bhudevi]] and Sridevi, both at the sides of Sri [[Venkateshwara]] or Vishnu. Bhudevi is the representation and totality of the material world or energy, called the aparam Prakriti, in which she is called Mother Earth. Sridevi is the spiritual world or energy called the [[Prakriti]]. Lakshmi is the power of Vishnu.&lt;ref name=anandrao167&gt;{{cite book|author=Anand Rao|title=Soteriologies of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UxGEy6m4N9kC&amp;pg=PA167|year=2004|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-7205-2|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Balfour|title=Cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eoNRAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA10|year=1873|publisher=Adelphi Press|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside temples, Lakshmi is often shown together with Vishnu. In certain parts of India, Lakshmi plays a special role as the mediator between her husband Vishnu and his worldly devotees. When asking Vishnu for grace or forgiveness, the devotees often approach Him through the intermediary presence of Lakshmi.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 31 and 32 in Kinsley, David.

In South India, she is also worshipped as [[Andal]],an incarnation of Lakshmi.&lt;ref name=Rao&gt;{{cite book|title=Temples of Tamil Nadu|last=Rao|first=A.V.Shankaranarayana|publisher=Vasan Publications|isbn=978-81-8468-112-3|year=2012|pages=195–99|ref=Rao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary manifestations===

{{main|Ashta Lakshmi}}

Ashta Lakshmi(Sanskrit: अष्टलक्ष्मी,{{IAST|Aṣṭalakṣmī}}, lit. ''eight Lakshmis'') is a group of eight secondary manifestations of Lakshmi. The Ashta Lakshmis preside over eight sources of wealth and thus represent the eight powers of Shri Lakshmi. Temples dedicated to Ashta Lakshmi are found in Tamil Nadu, such as [[Ashtalakshmi Kovil]] near Chennai and in many other states of India.&lt;ref&gt;Vidya Dehejia and Thomas Coburn, Devi: the great goddess : female divinity in South Asian art, Smithsonian, {{ISBN|978-3791321295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ashta Lakshmis are as follows:

[[File:Ashta- Lakshmi.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Ashta Lakshmi]] murti worshipped in a [[Golu]] display during [[Dusshera]].]]

Other secondary representations of the goddess include Lakshmi manifesting in three forms: Sri Devi, [[Bhudevi]] and [[Nila Devi]]. This threefold goddess can be found, for example, in Sri Bhu Neela Sahita Temple near [[Dwaraka Tirumala]], Andhra Pradesh, and in Adinath Swami Temple in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Knapp, Spiritual India Handbook, {{ISBN|978-8184950243}}, page 392&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nepal]], Mahalakshmi is shown with 16 hands, each holding a sacred emblem, expressing a sacred gesture, or forming a mudra(lotus, pot, mudra of blessing, book, rosary, bell, shield, bow, arrow, sword, trident, mudra of admonition, noose, skull cap and kettledrum.)&lt;ref name= pal&gt;Pratapaditya Pal (1985), Art of Nepal: A Catalogue of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Collection, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520054073}}, page 120&lt;/ref&gt; In this representation, Mahalakshmi manifests as a kind, compassionate, tranquil deity sitting not on a lotus, but on a lion.&lt;ref name=pal/&gt;

===Jain temples===

Some [[Jain]] temples also depict Sri Lakshmi as a goddess of [[artha]] (wealth) and [[kama]] (pleasure). For example, she is exhibited with Vishnu in Parshvanatha Jain Temple at the [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho Monuments]] of Madhya Pradesh,&lt;ref name=vidya/&gt; where she is shown pressed against Vishnu's chest, while Vishnu cups a breast in his palm. The presence of Vishnu-Lakshmi iconography in a Jain temple built near the Hindu temples of Khajuraho, suggests the sharing and acceptance of Lakshmi across a spectrum of Indian religions.&lt;ref name=vidya&gt;Vidya Dehejia (2009), The Body Adorned: Sacred and Profane in Indian Art, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231140287}}, page 151&lt;/ref&gt; This commonality is reflected in the praise of Lakshmi found in the Jain text [[Kalpa Sūtra]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Jacobi (Editor: Max Muller, Republished with edits by Mahendra Kulasrestha), The Golden Book of Jainism, {{ISBN|978-8183820141}}, page 213&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation and legends==

[[File:Samudra manthan.jpg|thumb|250px|A manuscript depicting Samudra Manthan, with Lakshmi emerging with lotus in her hands.]]

[[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] (gods) and [[asura]]s (demons) were both mortal at one time in Hinduism. [[Amrita]], the divine nectar that grants immortality, could only be obtained by churning Kshirasagar ([[Ocean of Milk]]). The devas and asuras both sought immortality and decided to churn the Kshirasagar with Mount Mandhara. The [[samudra manthan]] commenced with the devas on one side and the asuras on the other. [[Vishnu]] incarnated as Kurma, the tortoise and a mountain was placed on the tortoise as a churning pole. [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], the great venom-spewing serpent-god, was wrapped around the mountain and used to churn the ocean. A host of divine celestial objects came up during the churning. Along with them emerged the goddess Lakshmi. In some versions, she is said to be daughter of the sea god since she emerged from the sea.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In [[Garuda Purana]], [[Linga Purana]] and [[Padma Purana]], Lakshmi is said to have been born as daughter of the divine sage [[Bhrigu]] and his wife Khyati and was named ''Bhargavi''. According to Vishnu Purana, the universe was created when the ''Devas''(god) and ''Asuras''(evil) churn the cosmic ocean of milk([[Ksheera Sagara]]). Lakshmi came out of the ocean bearing lotus, along with divine cow [[Kamadhenu]], [[Varuni]], [[Parijat]] tree, [[Apsaras]], [[Chandra]](the moon) and [[Dhanvantari]] with [[Amrita]](nectar of immortality). When she appeared, she had a choice to go to Devas or Asuras. She chose Devas' side and among thirty deities, she chose to be with Vishnu. Thereafter, in all three worlds, the lotus-bearing goddess was celebrated.&lt;ref name=buitenen&gt;J. A. B. van Buitenen (Translator), Cornelia Dimmitt (Editor), Classical Hinduism: A Reader in the Sanskrit Puranas, Temple University Press, {{ISBN|978-0877221227}}, pages 95-99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebration in Hindu society==

Many Hindus worship Lakshmi on [[Diwali]], the festival of lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=8HhVcspIBU4C&amp;pg=PA179|title = Invisible River: Sir Richard's Last Mission|first=Zak|last=Vera|quote="First Diwali day called ''Dhanteras'' or wealth worship.

==Hymns==

{{Vaishnavism}}

Countless hymns, prayers, [[Śloka|shlokas]], [[stotra]], songs and legends dedicated to Mahalakshmi are recited during the ritual worship of Lakshmi.&lt;ref name=rhodes/&gt;

These include Sri Mahalakshmi Ashtakam, Sri Lakshmi Sahasaranama Stotra(by Sanathkumara), Sri Stuti(by Sri Vedantha Desikar), Sri [[Lakshmi Stuti By Indra]], Sri Kanakadhara Stotra(by Sri [[Adi Shankara]]), Sri Chatussloki(by Sri [[Yamunacharya]]), Narayani Stuti, [[Devi Mahatmyam]] Middle episode, Argala Stotra, Sri Lakshmi Sloka(by [[Bhagavan]] Sri Hari Swamiji) and [[Sri Sukta]], which is contained in the Vedas.

==Archaeology==

A representation of the goddess as Gaja Lakshmi or Lakshmi flanked by two elephants spraying her with water, is one of the most frequently found in archaeological sites.&lt;ref name=usingh/&gt;&lt;ref name=ashav/&gt; An ancient sculpture of Gaja Lakshmi (from Sonkh site at [[Mathura]]) dates to the pre-[[Kushan Empire]] era.&lt;ref name=usingh&gt;Upinder Singh (2009), A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century, {{ISBN|978-8131711200}}, Pearson Education, pages 438&lt;/ref&gt; Atranjikhera site in modern [[Uttar Pradesh]] has yielded [[terracotta]] plaque with images of Lakshmi dating to 2nd century BCE. Other archaeological sites with ancient Lakshmi terracotta figurines from the 1st millennium BCE include Vaisali, Sravasti, Kausambi, Campa, and Candraketugadh.&lt;ref name=ashav&gt;Asha Vishnu (1993), Material life of northern India: Based on an archaeological study, 3rd century B.C. to 1st century BCE, {{ISBN|978-8170994107}}, pages 194-195&lt;/ref&gt;

The goddess Lakshmi is frequently found in ancient coins of various Hindu kingdoms from Afghanistan to India. Gaja Lakshmi has been found on coins of [[Scythians#Archaeology|Scytho-Parthian]] kings [[Azes II]] and [[Azilises]]; she also appears on [[Shunga Empire]] king Jyesthamitra era coins, both dating to 1st millennium BCE. Coins from 1st through 4th century CE found in various locations in India such as Ayodhya, Mathura, Ujjain, Sanchi, Bodh Gaya, Kanauj, all feature Lakshmi.&lt;ref&gt;Upinder Singh (2009), A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century, {{ISBN|978-8131711200}}, Pearson Education, pages 438, 480 for image&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ancient Greco-Indian gems and seals with images of Lakshmi have been found, estimated to be from 1st millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Duffield Osborne (1914), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/497307 A Graeco-Indian Engraved Gem] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201070905/http://www.jstor.org/stable/497307 |date=1 February 2016 }}, American Journal of Archaeology,  Vol. 18, No. 1, pages 32-34&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1400-year-old rare granite sculpture of Lakshmi has been recovered at the Waghama village along [[Jehlum]] in [[Anantnag]] district of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090413/j&amp;k.htm#20 |title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Jammu &amp; Kashmir |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102180808/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090413/j%26k.htm#20 |archivedate=2 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Goddess [[Kisshōten|Kishijoten]] of Japan corresponds to Lakshmi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Russell Coulter|author2=Patricia Turner|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sEIngqiKOugC |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-96390-3 |pages=102, 285, 439}}, Quote (p 102): "Kishijoten, a goddess of luck who corresponds to Lakshmi, the Indian goddess of fortune..."&lt;/ref&gt; Kishijoten is the goddess of fortune and prosperity.&lt;ref name=encyclo1&gt;Charles Russell Coulter and Patricia Turner (2013), Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities, Taylor and Francis, {{ISBN|9781135963903}}, page 102&lt;/ref&gt; Kishijoten is considered the sister of the deity [[Vaiśravaṇa#In Japan|Bishamon]] (毘沙門, also known as Tamon or Bishamon-ten); Bishamon protects human life, fights evil, and brings good fortune. In ancient and medieval Japan, Kishijoten was the goddess worshiped for luck and prosperity, particularly on behalf of children. Kishijoten was also the guardian goddess of [[Geisha]]s. While Bishamon and Kishijoten are found in ancient Chinese and Japanese Buddhist literature, their roots have been traced to deities in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=encyclo1/&gt;

===Tibet and Nepal===
In Tibetan Buddhism she is an important deity, especially in the [[Gelug]] School. She has both peaceful and wrathful forms. Her wrathful form is known as  [[Palden Lhamo]] or Shri Devi Dudsol Dokam or Kamadhatvishvari, and is the principal female protector of ([[Gelug]]) Tibetan Buddhism and of Lhasa, Tibet.

Goddess [[Vasudhara]] in Tibetan and Nepalese culture is closely analogous to goddess Lakshmi as well.&lt;ref name=miranda&gt;Miranda Shaw (2006), Buddhist Goddesses of India, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691127583}}, Chapter 13 with pages 258–262&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bali (Indonesia)===
Goddess Lakshmi is closely linked to a goddess worshipped in [[Bali]], i.e. [[Dewi Sri]], as the goddess of fertility and agriculture.

The law of chastity is taught to church members of all ages, and is especially emphasized to [[adolescents]].

==General standards==

Within the LDS Church, chastity means more than abstinence from sex. It means to be morally clean in "thoughts, words, and actions." It also means sexual relations are only permitted between a husband and wife. The church teaches its members that "no one, male or female, is to have sexual relations before marriage. After marriage, sexual relations are permitted only with our spouse."&lt;ref name=gospelprinciples /&gt;

Mormons believe that sexuality between man and woman lawfully married is divinely appointed and has two purposes: to "multiply, and replenish the Earth" ({{lds|Genesis|gen|1|28}}) as commanded by God to [[Adam and Eve]], and to strengthen the bond between man and woman that they might "become one flesh" ({{lds|Mark|mark|10|8}}). A church handbook for leaders states that married couples should be made aware "that sexual relations within marriage are divinely approved not only for the purpose of procreation, but also as a way of expressing love and strengthening emotional and spiritual bonds between husband and wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url= http://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/selected-church-policies#21.4.4 |contribution= 21.4.4: Birth Control |title= [[Handbook 2: Administering the Church]] |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2010 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141021203917/https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/selected-church-policies#21.4.4 |archivedate= 2014-10-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The church has made its views clear in many publications and in recent news releases that "marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= First Presidency, Council of the Twelve Apostles |author-link= First Presidency (LDS Church) |author2-link= Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church) |last-author-amp= yes |date= September 23, 1995 |title= The Family: A Proclamation to the World |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= 2013-12-11 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131208223716/https://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation |archivedate= December 8, 2013 |df=  }}. See also: [[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]&lt;/ref&gt; While opposing homosexual behavior, the church advises its leaders and members to reach out with understanding and respect to individuals who are attracted to those of the same gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution= 21.4.6: Homosexual Behavior and Same-Gender Attraction |chapter-url= http://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/selected-church-policies#21.4.6 |title= [[Handbook 2: Administering the Church]] |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2010 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141021203917/https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/selected-church-policies#21.4.6 |archivedate= 2014-10-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sexual relations are deemed proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife. Any other sexual relations, including those between persons of the same gender, are sinful and undermine the divinely created institution of the family. The church accordingly affirms defining marriage as the legal and lawful union between a man and a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution= 21.4.10: Same-Gender Marriages |chapter-url= http://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/selected-church-policies#21.4.10 |title= [[Handbook 2: Administering the Church]] |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2010 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141021203917/https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/selected-church-policies#21.4.10 |archivedate= 2014-10-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth teaching==
{{Main|For the Strength of Youth}}
An LDS Church publication targeted at youth states: "Before marriage, do not participate in passionate kissing, lie on top of another person, or touch the private, sacred parts of another person's body, with or without clothing. Do not do anything else that arouses sexual feelings. Do not arouse those emotions in your own body.”&lt;ref name="FTSOY"&gt;{{citation |chapter-url= http://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/sexual-purity |contribution= Sexual Purity |title= [[For the Strength of Youth]] |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Youth are taught in church classes that sexual relations are sacred, and they should avoid "fondling of bodies, one's own or that of others".&lt;ref name="aaronphmanual"&gt;{{cite |contribution= Lesson 41: Sexual Purity |title= Aaronic Priesthood Manual 1 |page= 147 |url= //www.lds.org/manual/aaronic-priesthood-manual-1/lesson-41-sexual-purity |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2002 |accessdate= 2010-11-24 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120717201250/http://www.lds.org/manual/aaronic-priesthood-manual-1/lesson-41-sexual-purity |archivedate= 2012-07-17 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Masturbation is "not condoned but is not considered homosexual".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/3773 |contribution= Homosexuality |last= Brown |first= Victor L.

==Importance==
The LDS Church places great emphasis on the law of chastity. Commitment to live the law of chastity is required for [[baptism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/how-do-i-prepare-people-for-baptism-and-confirmation "Chapter 12: How Do I Prepare People for Baptism and Confirmation?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021181443/https://www.lds.org/manual/preach-my-gospel-a-guide-to-missionary-service/how-do-i-prepare-people-for-baptism-and-confirmation |date=2015-10-21 }}, ''[[Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2004) pp. 203–12.&lt;/ref&gt; and adherence is required to receive a [[temple recommend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= //www.lds.org/liahona/2010/08/being-worthy-to-enter-the-temple |title= Being Worthy to Enter the Temple |journal= [[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]] |date= August 2010 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151021181448/https://www.lds.org/liahona/2010/08/being-worthy-to-enter-the-temple |archivedate= 2015-10-21 |df=  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Mormon]] teaches that sexual sins are "most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost" ({{lds|Alma|alma|39|5}}). Church leaders have similarly emphasized its importance.

[[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Spencer W. Kimball]], in his book ''[[Miracle of Forgiveness]]'', quoted [[Heber J. Grant]] as saying, "[t]here is no true Latter-day Saint who would not rather bury a son or daughter than to have him or her lose his or her chastity—realizing that chastity is of more value than anything else in all the world."{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

LDS Church president [[Ezra Taft Benson]] wrote:

{{cquote|From the beginning of time, the Lord has set a clear and unmistakable standard of sexual purity. It always has been, it is now, and it always will be the same. That standard is the law of chastity. It is the same for all—for men and women, for old and young, for rich and poor. In the Book of Mormon, the prophet Jacob tells us that the Lord delights in the chastity of His children (see {{lds|Jacob|jacob|2|28}}). Do you hear that, my brothers and sisters? The Lord is not just pleased when we are chaste; He delights in chastity. Mormon taught the same thing to his son Moroni when he wrote that chastity and virtue are 'most dear and precious above all things.' ({{lds|Moroni|moro|9|9}})&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Ezra Taft Benson |first= Ezra Taft |last= Benson |url= //www.lds.org/new-era/1988/01/the-law-of-chastity |title= The Law of Chastity |journal= [[New Era (magazine)|New Era]] |date= January 1988 |page= 4 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130529074646/http://www.lds.org/new-era/1988/01/the-law-of-chastity |archivedate= 2013-05-29 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Violation of the law of chastity may result in [[Disciplinary council|church discipline]], including disfellowshipment or excommunication.

==In endowment ceremony==
The law of chastity is one of the [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenants]] members of the LDS Church promise by oath to keep during the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment ceremony]] of the [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Bryce J. |last= Christensen |chapter-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5912 |contribution= Chastity, Law of |pages= 265–266 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H.

Talmage |first= James E. |last= Talmage |title= [[The House of the Lord]] |place= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= LDS Church |year= 1912 |page= 100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Includes broader transgressions==
Activities considered a violation of the law of chastity include both [[adultery]] and [[fornication]] as well as broader behavior. While serving as church president, Kimball taught that the law of chastity encompasses "all sexual relations outside marriage—[[Making out|petting]], sex perversion, masturbation, and preoccupation with sex in one's thoughts and talking. Included are every hidden and secret sin and all unholy and impure thoughts and practices."&lt;ref name=speaksout&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Spencer W. Kimball |first= Spencer W. |last= Kimball |url= //www.lds.org/ensign/1980/11/president-kimball-speaks-out-on-morality |title= President Kimball Speaks Out on Morality |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= November 1980 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140512223846/https://www.lds.org/ensign/1980/11/president-kimball-speaks-out-on-morality |archivedate= 2014-05-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims of [[rape]], [[incest]], or [[sexual abuse]] are not guilty of sin and are not considered to have broken the law of chastity.&lt;ref name=sexualpurity&gt;{{citation |url= //www.lds.org/liahona/2010/07/sexual-purity-blesses-our-lives |title= Sexual Purity Blesses Our Lives |journal= [[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]] |date= July 2010 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151021181525/https://www.lds.org/liahona/2010/07/sexual-purity-blesses-our-lives |archivedate= 2015-10-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they often feel that they have lost their virtue, which intensifies the feelings of shame and guilt experienced by many victims of rape. In the Book of Mormon, it states, "For behold, many of the daughters of the Lamanites have they taken prisoners; and after depriving them of that which was most dear and precious above all things, which is chastity and virtue".&lt;ref&gt; {{lds|Moroni|moro|9|9}} &lt;/ref&gt; In a [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]] address, [[Richard G. Scott]] explained, "The victim must do all in his or her power to stop the abuse. Most often, the victim is innocent because of being disabled by fear or the power or authority of the offender. At some point in time, however, the Lord may prompt a victim to recognize a degree of responsibility for abuse. Your priesthood leader will help assess your responsibility so that, if needed, it can be addressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Scott |authorlink= Richard G. Scott |first= Richard |title= Healing the Tragic Scars of Abuse |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= May 1992 |url= //www.lds.org/ensign/1992/05/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131115210949/http://www.lds.org/ensign/1992/05/healing-the-tragic-scars-of-abuse |archivedate= 2013-11-15 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, members are taught to dress modestly, to control their thoughts, and to avoid [[pornography]].&lt;ref name=gospelprinciples /&gt;&lt;ref name=sexualpurity /&gt; Dressing immodestly is not a violation of the law of chastity, but "modesty promotes chastity".&lt;ref name=sexualpurity /&gt; Members who are married are instructed to "be faithful to your spouse in thought, word, and action.  Stay away from situations where temptation may develop."&lt;ref name=sexualpurity /&gt;

According to the church, even though the violation of the law of chastity is considered a serious [[sin]], one who has violated the law of chastity can repent and receive forgiveness from God.&lt;ref name=gospelprinciples /&gt;&lt;ref name=sexualpurity /&gt;&lt;ref name=speaksout /&gt;

After the creation of the [[SGPC]] and the [[Nankana massacre]] involving Mahant Narayan Das, a law was passed handing over gurdwaras to orthodox Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgpc.net/glossary/Mahant.asp Mahant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223195609/http://sgpc.net/glossary/Mahant.asp |date=2009-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secular use ==
In [[Chhuikhadan State]], the Mahants were the rulers of the princely state.  "Mahant" is also a common surname in Assam.  See [[Mahanta (disambiguation)]] for list of persons named Mahanta or Mahant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8091">The '''marketplace of ideas''' is a rationale for [[freedom of expression]] based on an [[analogy]] to the [[economics|economic]] concept of a [[free market]]. The marketplace of ideas holds that the [[truth]] will emerge from the competition of ideas in free, transparent public discourse, and concludes that ideas and ideologies will be culled according to their superiority or inferiority and widespread acceptance among the population. The concept is often applied to discussions of [[patent law]] as well as [[freedom of the press]] and the responsibilities of the media in a [[liberal democracy]].

The marketplace of ideas [[metaphor]] is founded in the philosophy of [[John Milton]] in his work "[[Areopagitica]]" in 1644 and also [[John Stuart Mill]]  in his book, ''[[On Liberty]]'' in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ingber |first1=Stanley |title=The Marketplace of Ideas: A Legitimizing Myth |journal=Duke Law Journal |date=February 1984 |issue=1 |page=3 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fa1b/c9ef33f67d03637b24dad1b305a6a7b937b9.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2018 |format=PDF |quote=... this classic image of competing ideas and robust debate dates back to English philosophers John Milton and John Stuart Mill ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later used in opinions by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The first reference to the "free trade in ideas" within "the competition of the market" appears in Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]'s dissent in ''[[Abrams v. United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Abrams v. United States]]'', 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919)&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "marketplace of ideas" first appears in a concurring opinion by Justice [[William O. Douglas]] in the Supreme Court decision ''[[United States v. Rumely]]'' in 1953: "Like the publishers of newspapers, magazines, or books, this publisher bids for the minds of men in the market place of ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=First Amendment Fellow |url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/holmes%E2%80%99-idea-marketplace-%E2%80%93-its-origins-legacy |title=Holmes’ idea marketplace – its origins &amp; legacy &amp;#124; First Amendment Center – news, commentary, analysis on free speech, press, religion, assembly, petition |publisher=Firstamendmentcenter.org |date=2010-05-13 |accessdate=2014-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court's 1969 decision in ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'' enshrined the marketplace of ideas as the dominant public policy in [[Freedom of speech in the United States|American free speech law]] (that is, against which narrow exceptions to freedom of speech must be justified by specific countervailing public policies). While the previous cases dealt with natural persons,{{fact|date=September 2018}} the 1976 decision ''[[Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council]]'' expanded it to corporations by creating a curtailed corporate commercial speech right, striking down a government regulation of advertising in the process.&lt;ref name="WeTheCorporations"&gt;{{Cite book |title=We the Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights |last=Winkler |first=Adam |publisher=Liveright |year=2018 |isbn=978-0871407122}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has not been seriously questioned since in United States jurisprudence,{{fact|date=September 2018}} but the legacy of those decisions have lead to subsequent decisions like ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' that curtailed the government's ability to regulate corporate speech&lt;ref name="WeTheCorporations"/&gt; and much more expansive advertising campaigns, commercial and political, than Americans had experienced previously.&lt;ref name="Adcreep"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Adcreep: The Case Against Modern Marketing |last=Bartholomew |first=Mark |publisher=Stanford Law Books |year=2017 |isbn=978-0804795814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general idea that free speech should be tolerated because it will lead toward the truth has a long history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1691952 "How Much Does a Belief Cost? Revisiting the Marketplace of Ideas"], Gregory Brazeal, ''Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal'', vol. 21 no. 1, pp. 2–10 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The English poet [[John Milton]] suggested that restricting speech was not necessary because "in a free and open encounter", truth would prevail.&lt;ref&gt;John Milton, ''Areopagitica'', in ''Areopagitica and Of Education'' 1, 50 (Harlan Davidson, Inc. 1951) [1644].&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] argued that it is safe to tolerate "error of opinion ... where reason is left free to combat it".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, ''First Inaugural Address'' (Mar. 4, 1801), in ''Writings'' 492, 493 (Merrill D. Peterson ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Fredrick Siebert echoed the idea that free expression is self-correcting in ''Four Theories of the Press'': "Let all with something to say be free to express themselves. The true and sound will survive. The false and unsound will be vanquished. Government should keep out of the battle and not weigh the odds in favor of one side or the other."&lt;ref&gt;Siebert, Fred S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Q-oePDdcC8C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=siebert+%22true+and+sound%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F20MjjnSpZ&amp;sig=7yvt6AILK4WtDh9aSTKF8iMjaLw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UShsTJKDMoP7lwedorDyAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=true%20and%20sound&amp;f=false "The Libertarian Theory"] in Fred S. Siebert, Theodore Peterson, and Wilbur Schramm's ''Four Theories of the Press: The Authoritarian, Libertarian, Social Responsibility, and Soviet Communist Concepts of What the Press Should Be and Do'', p. 45. Chicago: University of Illinois Press. (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; These writers did not rely on the economic analogy to a market.

If beliefs such as [[religion]]s are considered as ideas, the marketplace of ideas concept favors a marketplace of religions rather than forcing a state religion or forbidding incompatible beliefs. In this sense, it provides a rationale for [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ullman Chiswick|first=Carmel|title=Competition vs. Monopoly in the Religious Marketplace: Judaism in the United States and Israel|url=http://ftp.iza.org/dp7188.pdf|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years questions have arisen regarding the existence of markets in ideas. Several scholars have noted differences between the way ideas are produced and consumed and the way more traditional goods are produced and consumed.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1691952 ''How Much Does a Belief Cost? Revisiting the Marketplace of Ideas''], Gregory Brazeal, ''Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal'', vol. 21 no. 1, p. 1 (2011); ''The Competition of Ideas: Market or Garden?'', Robert Sparrow &amp; Robert Goodin, Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy, vol. 4 no. 2, p. 45 (2001); ''Speech, Truth, and the Free Market for Ideas'', Alvin I. Goldman &amp; James C. Cox, Legal Theory, vol. 2, p. 1 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that the idea of the marketplace of ideas as applied to religion "incorrectly assumes a level playing field" among religions.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Makau Mutua, [http://www.manushi-india.org/pdfs_issues/PDF%20Files%20150/Sankrant%20Sanu.%204-12.pdf ''Facilitating Freedom of Religion or Belief, A Deskbook.'']&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the idea of a marketplace of ideas has been applied to the study of scientific research as a social institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uned.es/dpto_log/jpzb/abstracts.html#The_economics_of_scientific_knowledge |title=Jesús Zamora Bonilla &amp;#124; Dpto.

==The Procession==
After the Exchange of the rings the priest leads the couple in procession into the middle of the church. The priest chants Psalm 128, "Blessed is everyone who fears the Lord, who walks in His ways..." This psalm is one of the "Psalms of Ascent" sung by Jewish pilgrims on the way to the Jerusalem Temple. This point in the service most clearly reveals the "action" of the sacrament. The couple brings themselves, each other, their lives, and all that fills their lives, to the altar as an offering to God. As the couple enters into the midst of the Church, their relationship enters into the new reality of God's Kingdom.

==Declaration of intent and lighting of candles==

Having processed into the church, the couple must individually proclaim, before the assembly, that they have come freely, without constraints or prior commitment, to be joined by God as husband and wife. (In modern practice, these proclamations are often done at the beginning, before the exchange of the rings.)

The bride and groom are then handed candles which are held throughout the service.  The candles represent the couple's faith and willingness to follow the Light of Truth, [[Jesus Christ]], and that they will have their way through life lighted by the teachings of the Church.

==The crowning==
[[File:Ventsy brachnye.jpg|thumb|Russian-style wedding crowns, 19th century.]]
After prayers are offered on their behalf, the groom and bride are crowned by the priest "In the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
O Lord, our God, crown them in glory and in honour.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
The crowns have two meanings.  First, they reveal that the man and woman, in their union with Christ, participate in His Kingship.  Second, as in the ancient Church, crowns are a symbol of martyrdom.  The word "martyr" means witness. The common life of the bride and groom is to bear witness to the Presence of Christ in their lives and in the world. Martyrdom is usually associated with death.  So the reality of God's Kingdom in the life of the husband and wife will necessarily take the form of dying to one's self, to one's will, and the giving of one's life totally to the other, and through the other, to Christ.

==The epistle==
The epistle is taken from St. Paul's letter to the Ephesians (5:20-33). It presents the cornerstone of the Christian vision of marriage: the love of man and woman parallels the love of Christ and the Church. As Christ gives Himself totally to and for His Church, so the husband is to give himself totally to and for his wife. As the Church, in turn, is subject to Christ, so the wife subjects herself to her husband. Thus the two become one in a life of mutual love and mutual subjection to each other in Christ.

==The gospel==
The gospel, from John (2:1-11), is the familiar account of the [[Marriage at Cana]] where Christ turns the water into wine. A person must drink water simply to survive.  Wine, on the other hand, is more than just a drink that quenches thirst and continues life.  Wine is associated with joy, with celebration, with life as being more than mere survival.  By His presence at this wedding He changes the union of man and woman into something new.  Marriage becomes more than a mere human institution, existing for whatever purpose a society assigns it.  It becomes, like the Church Herself, a sign that God's Kingdom has already begun in our midst.

==The common cup and the dance of Isaiah==
After more prayers, a common cup of sweet wine is blessed and shared by the couple as a sign of their common life together, a sharing of joys and sorrows, successes and failures, hopes and fears:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I shall partake in the Cup of Salvation,&lt;br&gt;
and I shall invoke the name of the Lord.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is followed by the triple procession around the center table: the "Dance of [[Isaiah]]". The priest, holding the Gospel or Blessing Cross and the clasped hands of the groom and bride, and followed by the best man (or woman) who holds the newlyweds' crowns above their heads, and the bridesmaids holding the lit white candles, walk three counterclockwise turns around the table in a celebratory "dance".  Each of the three turns is accompanied by each of the three hymns, which return once more to the theme of martyrdom and union with Christ. These are the hymns that, since ancient times, the Church has used to emphasize God's blessings, and the same ones sung at ordinations to ecclesiastical orders.  They signify that this couple has been set apart from the mundane world to live a life in Christ:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Rejoice, O [[Isaiah]]! The Virgin is with child,&lt;br&gt;
:And shall bear a son Emmanuel,&lt;br&gt;
:Both God and Man,&lt;br&gt;
:And Orient is His Name,&lt;br&gt;
:Whom magnifying we call, the Virgin blessed.&lt;br&gt;

::O Holy [[Martyr]]s,&lt;br&gt;
::who fought the good fight and have received your crowns, &lt;br&gt;
::Entreat ye the Lord,&lt;br&gt;
::That He will have mercy on our souls.&lt;br&gt;

:::Glory to Thee, O Christ our God,&lt;br&gt;
:::The [[Apostles]] boast,&lt;br&gt;
:::The Martyrs Joy,&lt;br&gt;
:::whose preaching was the Consubstantial [[Trinity]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Throughout the service, things are done in threes in remembrance of the [[Trinity]].  Man is made in the image and likeness of God. Marriage is intended by God to be an image of the Trinity.  It is the union of three persons, not two.  Man and woman are one with each other and one with the person of Jesus Christ.

==Removal of the crowns==
At the end of the service, the crowns are removed and the priest prays that God will receive these crowns into His Kingdom. The reality of the Kingdom into which the bride and groom have entered is not completely fulfilled, but only begun. Husband and wife must receive God's Kingdom and make it both a present reality and a challenge and goal of their common life, in that sense, the Christ-centered marriage is eternal: "every relationship formed in this life will continue in the next life, in a deeply healed and purified way."&lt;ref&gt;Ford, David. "The Glory of Marriage." ''Glory and Honor: Orthodox Christian Resources on Marriage.'' (Yonkers, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 2016) p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Completion and fulfillment will come when Christ returns in power and glory to complete the establishment of His Kingdom in this world by filling all things with Himself.

==The greeting of the couple ==
At the end of the service, the couple stands at the foot of the altar. From the beginning, at the back of the church, they have now progressed to the forefront. Only the eternal Kingdom of Jesus Christ, as signified by the Altar, remains ahead of them. The couple's final act is to turn and face the assembled Church. Through this sacrament, they have become an icon of the Church and icon of Christ and the assembly comes up to congratulate them and share in their joy.

==Divorce==
[[Divorce]] is permitted in the Orthodox Church for various reasons.  The more usual divorce occurs under the pastoral guidance of the spiritual director of the spouses when all attempts at salvaging a marriage have been exhausted. In such cases, remarriage may be possible but there is a special rite for a second marriage which contains a penitential element for the dissolution of the first, i.e. some of the more joyful aspects are removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thyateira.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=102&amp;Itemid=119 Divorce], Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain.&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage is permitted up to three times in Orthodoxy but each divorce necessitates a short period of [[excommunication]]. 

Another type of divorce is what is known as a "hieratic divorce", which does not signify the breakdown of the relationship but is a step taken for the sake of the [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]] of the spouses and with the full support and blessing of the Church.  This type of divorce may only take place where there is mutual agreement between the two spouses, and is usually carried out in cases where one or both spouses wish to enter into monasticism.

[[File:Poynter's Daniel's Prayer.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Relief print]] of Daniel's prayer by [[Edward Poynter]], 1865. [[Book of Daniel|Daniel 6]] describes how [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] prayed even though threatened with death, while Daniel 9 records a prayer that he prayed.]] 
'''Prayer in the Hebrew Bible''' is an evolving means of interacting with [[God]], most frequently through a spontaneous, individual, unorganized form of petitioning and/or thanking. Standardized prayer such as is done today is non-existent, though beginning in [[Deuteronomy]], the Bible lays the groundwork for organized [[prayer]], including basic liturgical guidelines, and by the Bible's later books, prayer has evolved to a more standardized form, although still radically different from the [[Tefillah|form practiced]] by modern [[Jews]].

Individual prayer is described by the ''[[Tanakh]]'' two ways. The first of these is when prayer is described as occurring, and a result is achieved, but no further information regarding a person's prayer is given. In these instances, such as with [[Isaac]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%2025:21&amp;version=NIV |title=Gen. 25: 21 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moses]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2011:2&amp;version=NIV |title=Num. 11:2 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel+8:6&amp;version=NIV |title=1 Samuel 8:6 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+42:10&amp;version=NIV |title=Job. 42:10 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the act of praying is a method of changing a situation for the better. The second way in which prayer is depicted is through fully fleshed out episodes of prayer, where a person's prayer is related in full. Many famous biblical personalities have such a prayer, including every major character from [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] to [[Hezekiah]].&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, "Prayer," http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=496&amp;letter=P&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual prayer==
Often in the [[Hebrew Bible]], individuals spontaneously pray to God when faced with difficulty or having avoided it. As mentioned above, these prayers are not always given in full, however, many are fully related. Certain themes appear throughout the Tanakh's portrayal of this prayer type. One of the most significant&lt;ref&gt;William S. Morrow, “Protest Against God: The Eclipse of Biblical Tradition.”&lt;/ref&gt; is the idea of argumentation, which is frequently described by the text, or its interpreters. 

Listed chronologically below are these occurrences of recorded individual prayer.

===Abraham===

The first notable prayer{{cn|date=December 2013}} whose text is recorded in the [[Torah]] and Hebrew Bible occurs when [[Abraham]] pleads with God not to destroy the people of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]], where his nephew [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] resides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2018&amp;version=NIV |title=Gen. 18:23-32 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He bargains with God not to destroy the city if there are fifty good men within, and eventually lowers to total to ten. God sends two angels to the city, which is ultimately destroyed with "burning sulfur"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2019:24&amp;version=NIV |title=Gen. 19:24 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they cannot find the ten requisite good people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2019:13&amp;version=NIV |title=Gen. 19:13 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eliezer===

When Abraham is an old man, he makes his head servant, who while not named specifically, is almost certainly [[Eliezer of Damascus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=208&amp;letter=E |title=Jewish Encyclopedia, "Eliezer" |publisher=Jewishencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; promise to find his son [[Isaac]] a wife from his people to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2024:3-4&amp;version=NIV |title=Gen. 24:3-4 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eliezer expresses uncertainty that a woman will agree to return to Abraham's household, especially since he is told not to bring Isaac with him. In response, Abraham tells Eliezer that God will send an angel to assure his success in his mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2024:7&amp;version=NIV |title=Gen. 24:7 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eliezer, however, upon reaching the town of Nahor's well during evening, when the women of the city would draw water, begins to pray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2024:12-14&amp;version=NIV |title=Gen. 24:12-14 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eliezer's prayer makes very specific of God, hoping that God will make clear which woman is to be Isaac's wife. It takes on a petitioning tone, as opposed to the argumentative one prominent in the prayers of other characters, including his master, whose relationship and interactions with God are very different. Before he has finished with his prayer, his requests begin to be granted, and sees that [[Rebbecca]] is the chosen maiden. Eliezer rushes home with her and she and Isaac are married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2024:56-62&amp;version=NIV |title=Gen. 24:56-62 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacob===

When [[Jacob]] is to reunite with his brother [[Esau]], he prays in distress that God save him from what he fears will be an attack on him, his family, and his servants. Similarly to his grandfather Abraham, his prayer lays out an argument, in this case by invoking statements God had made in the past to convince God to aid him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%2032:%209-12&amp;version=NIV |title=Gen. 32: 9-12 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob's prayer does not seem to impact his optimism, for when Esau approaches, he divides his children among his maidservants and wives, so as to protect them from what he still feels is an immanent attack. The Torah, however, when taken literally, describes a joyful meeting, with Esau disregarding formalities so as to embrace his brother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen.%2033:1-3&amp;version=NIV |title=Gen. 33:1-3 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although interpreters suggest Esau actually attacked his younger brother.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis Rabbah 78:9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moses===

[[Moses]], the most recurring character in the Torah, prays comparatively little in a truly spontaneous petitioning or thanking form. The one occasion that is most definitely prayer takes place when, in the [[Book of Exodus]], following the making of the [[Golden Calf]], he prays for God to be merciful with his people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus%2032:31-32&amp;version=NIV |title=Ex. 32:31-32 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literal reading of the text does not include an argument made by Moses, in a similar manner to other characters, however, [[Rashi]] describes him as blaming God for the people's sin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9893/showrashi/true |title=Chabad.org, "Complete Tanach With Rashi," Exodus 32 |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore interprets the prayer to be more similar to those said by Abraham and Jacob.

===Song of the Sea===

''See: [[Song of the sea]]''

===Joshua===

In the [[Book of Joshua]], the Israelites battle against many different opposing nations. The book's seventh chapter describes how God punishes His people by causing them to lose a battle as a result of their sinning. Following news of the defeat, Joshua and the elders of Israel tear their clothes and lie face down in front of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and following that, Joshua prays to God bemoaning his people's lowered moral, vulnerability to attack, and possible extermination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=joshua%207&amp;version=NIV |title=Joshua 7 NIV - Achan’s Sin - But the Israelites were |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hannah===

In [[1 Samuel]] 1, [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] prays for a child. 1 Samuel 1:13 says that "Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard" ([[NIV]]). The priest [[Eli (Bible)|Eli]] thinks that she is drunk, but Hannah protests her innocence. After Hannah gives birth to a son, [[Samuel]], she prays a prayer which is recorded in 1 Samuel 2:1-10. This is normally called the [[Song of Hannah]], but according to 1 Samuel 2:1, it is a prayer.

[[Eugene Peterson]] suggests that to Eli, the "normal way of prayer" was "by means of ritual, incense, and animal sacrifice, a gathering of the community directed by a priest." Hannah is "soaring past all the liturgical conventions of her age... She uses her own words, her own voice, without intermediaries."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Peterson]], ''[http://aliteralmess.tumblr.com/post/27855098602/eugene-peterson-on-1-samuel-1-and-2-hannahs-story First and Second Samuel]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organized prayer==
Organized prayer is first introduced in the Hebrew Bible in [[Deuteronomy]], when the recitation of prayer over the fruit bringing sacrifice is mandated, and [[liturgy]] established for the first time, in [[Deuteronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0526.htm |title=Deut. 26:5-10, 13-15 |publisher=Mechon-mamre.org |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses mandates that one who goes to offer the sacrifice recite a basic [[creed]], declaring his people's heritage and history, as well as a prayer of thanks to God for the fruits they have [[harvest]]ed. Moses also requires Israelites to, at certain times, recite a declaration saying they have not transgressed any of the ''[[mitzvot]].''

There are a number of '''religious prohibitions''' in [[Sikhism]].
# '''Cutting hair:''' Cutting or removing [[hair]] from any body part is strictly forbidden for Amritdhari (formally baptized) Sikhs.
# '''Intoxication:''' Consumption of drugs and [[tobacco]], and other intoxicants is not allowed for Amritdhari Sikhs. Non-baptised Sikhs should refrain from alcohol as it is still a sin for Sikhs to consume intoxicants. Drugs and tobacco are forbidden for all. &lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.sgpc.net/rehat_maryada/section_four.html Sikh Reht Maryada, The Definition of Sikh, Sikh Conduct &amp; Conventions, Sikh Religion Living, India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.sgpc.net/rehat_maryada/section_six.html Sikh Reht Maryada, The Definition of Sikh, Sikh Conduct &amp; Conventions, Sikh Religion Living, India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.satnamnetwork.com/Vaisakhi/sikh_code_of_conduct.htm Sikh Code Of Conduct&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cannabis and Sikhism|Cannabis is generally prohibited]], but ritually consumed in edible form by some Sikhs.&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

# '''Blind spirituality:''' Superstitions and rituals should not be observed or followed, including pilgrimages, [[fasting]] and [[ritual purification]]; [[circumcision]]; idols, [[grave (burial)|grave]]  worship; compulsory wearing of the [[veil]] for women.  Observation of the 5 K's, is not considered blind superstition.
# '''Material obsession:''' Obsession with material wealth is not encouraged in Sikhism.
# '''Sacrifice of creatures:''' Practices such as [[Sati (practice)|sati]] (widows throwing themselves on the [[funeral]] [[pyre]] of their husbands) and ritual [[animal sacrifice]] to [[celebration (party)|celebrate]] holy occasions are forbidden.

# '''Worthless talk:''' [[Bragging]], [[gossip]], [[Lie|lying]], [[slander]], "back-stabbing", etc. are not permitted. The [[Guru Granth Sahib]] tells the Sikh, "Your mouth has not stopped slandering and gossiping about others. Your service is useless and fruitless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=1253&amp;english=t&amp;id=53906|title=Sri Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib|work=srigranth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Violation of prohibitions  ==
{{importance section|date=September 2015}}
Not all Sikh-identified people subscribe to these prohibitions. The Sahajdhari Sikhs reject most of the prohibitions, including trimming of hair (Kesh). Some young Sikhs are now cutting their hair to the dismay of spiritual leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/world/asia/29turban.html Young Sikh Men Get Haircuts, Annoying Their Elders]. ''[[New York Times]]''. March 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Sikh clergy, "the fad among youth to shed the [[dastar|pagri]]" is being observed more commonly among the Sikh youth in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] than Sikhs in other Indian states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Pagri_not_very_attractive_out_of_tune_with_times/articleshow/msid-223157,curpg-1.cms|title='Pagri not very attractive, out of tune with times'|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nihang]] Sikhs of Punjab, who are defenders of historic Sikh shrines, are an exception and consume an intoxicant called ''[[bhang]]'' ([[cannabis (drug)|cannabis sativa]]), opium and other narcotics to help in [[meditation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]. March 10, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Udasi]]s, who consider themselves as a denomination of Sikhism, lay emphasis on being ascetic, thus violating the "Non-family-oriented living" principle. [[Sri Chand]], the ascetic son of [[Guru Nanak]], was the founder of the [[Udasi]].

'''Ptah-Du-Auu''' was a [[Nobility|noble]]man and [[priest]] in [[ancient Egypt]], who lived during the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]]. Ptah-Du-Auu was named after the [[god]] [[Ptah]], whom he served.

==Biography==
Ptah-Du-Auu was the first known [[High Priest of Ptah]]. His titles were ''High Priest of the Ka of Ptah'' and ''Director of the Craftsmen of the [[Temple]] of Ptah of the White Wall''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://euler.slu.edu/~bart/egyptianhtml/kings%20and%20Queens/High_Priests_of_Memphis.html|title=High Priest of Ptah|website=euler.slu.edu|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was buried at [[Saqqara]]. Dominique Mallet excavated his tomb in the late 1960s.

'''Qabb Ilyas''' ({{lang-ar|قب الياس}}; [[ALA-LC]]: ''Qab Ilyās'' / &lt;small&gt;[[Lebanese Arabic]]:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|[Abblyes]}}) also spelled ''Kab Elias'', ''Qab Elias'', ''Qob Elias'', ''Qoub Elias'') is a municipality in [[Zahle District]], in eastern [[Lebanon]]. Qabb Ilyas is 15 kilometers from [[Zahleh]] and {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} from the Lebanese capital [[Beirut]]. Its average elevations is {{convert|950|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} above sea level. Its area is approximately 32&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name="kabeliasmuni"&gt;http://www.kabelias.org/Info.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Qabb Ilyas is the third largest city in the [[Beqaa Valley]], after [[Zahleh]] and [[Baalbek]] in terms of area size and geography. The majority of the residents are [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]]s.&lt;ref name="kabeliasmuni"/&gt;

==History==
According to the 19th-century Lebanese historian Haydar al-Shihabi, the town was originally called al-Muruj. Local tradition holds that the town's current name "Qabb Ilyas" is derived from ''Qabr Ilyas'' ("grave of Ilyas"), but was shortened over time to ''Qab Ilyas''. Ilyas was an 8th-century ''[[muqaddam]]'' from [[Mount Lebanon]], who was killed during a raid in the Beqaa Valley by the forces of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] governor of Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salibi|first1=Kamal S.|title=Maronite Historians of Mediæval Lebanon|date=1959|publisher=American University of Beirut|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KXptAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Qabr+Ilyas&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22a+tradition+that+Qab+Ilyas%22|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 16th century, the [[Bedouin]] chieftain of the Beqaa Valley, [[Mansur ibn Furaykh]], used Qabb Ilyas as one of his headquarters. He had a palatial home built in the village. Two years after his execution in [[Damascus]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities in December 1593, the Druze sheikh Ali Jumblatt took over the Beqaa Valley during his rebellion against the governor of [[Damascus Eyalet]]. During this rebellion, Mansur's home was seized by the Druze [[Maan family|Ma'ani]] emir, [[Fakhr ad-Din II]], who refused to restore it to Mansur's brother Murad ibn Furaykh despite an imperial Ottoman decree. The sons of Mansur, Nasrallah and Muhammad, continued to struggle for control of the property during Fakhr ad-Din's exile as the Shia [[Harfush clan|Harfushi]] sheikh Yunus al-Harfush took possession of the home.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Husayn, pp. 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ma'an dynasty built a formidable fortress in Qabb Ilyas that later emirs of Lebanon commissioned during times of rebellion against the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="Mishaqah136"/&gt; Sayyid-Ahmad Shihab occupied Qabb Ilyas in 1773 and robbed a group of Damascene merchants there, for which he was condemned and evicted from the area by his brother Emir [[Yusuf Shihab]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1820s, the Ottoman wali of Damascus, [[Burdurlu Dervish Mehmed Pasha|Darwish Pasha]], defeated Emir [[Bashir Shihab II]] and proceeded to demolish most of what remained of the Fakhr ad-Din Castle. He then assigned a Muslim from the [[Aleppo]]-based Araqtanji family to govern Qabb Ilyas.&lt;ref name="Mishaqah136"&gt;Mishaqah, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1860 Mount Lebanon civil war]], the Druze used Qabb Ilyas, which at the time was a religiously mixed village, as their local headquarters in the Beqaa Valley and it withstood a raid by fighters from the nearby Christian stronghold [[Zahle]].&lt;ref&gt;Fawaz, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; During French military intervention in the conflict, the French Army occupied Qabb Ilyas and maintained a military force there to guard the Beqaa Valley and southern Mount Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Fawaz, pp. 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans established an army garrison at Qabb Ilyas at the French withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Fawaz, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological remains==
[[Image:kabelias castle.jpg|right|thumb|Prince Fakhreddin II Castle Ruins]]

The Fakhr ad-Din II Citadel in Qabb Ilyas is believed to have been one of the largest Citadel in the Beqaa Valley. It is also thought to have been built by the Druze prince [[Fakhr ad-Din II]], who chose the location for its elevation and defensibility against potential assaults by the [Mamalik]] military. The citadel was eventually destroyed by the Ottomans, but the ruins remain.

[[File:kabelias haidara.jpg|right|thumb|Haidara Ruins]]

The Haidara ruins are believed to date back to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] era. According to local legend, there was once a mirror on the face of the building that used to reflect sunlight down into the village, related to sun-worshiping Roman practices.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Local government==
Qabb Ilyas is administered by an elected municipal council with six-year terms. It has administrative and financial independence, but remains under the control and supervision of the central government.

==Demographics==
It is estimated that Qabb Ilyas had a population of around 50,000 as of 2011. By 2013, as a result of the [[Syrian Civil War]], about 18,000 [[Syrian refugees]] were living in Qabb Ilyas as well.&lt;ref name=GlobalPost&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Josh|title=Syrian refugees raise tensions in fragile Lebanon|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/middle-east/syria/130830/syrian-refugees-lebanon-sectarian-us-military-strikes-assad|accessdate=2015-08-27|work=Global Post|date=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population lived in the following areas: Qabb Ilyas Fauka, Qabb Ilyas Tahta, Wadi El Delm, Farm of Bmahray, Bahsasa. In the 2004 municipal elections, it counted 14,602 registered voters, of which 8,771 voted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="954">The [[Sikhs]] in Amritsar formed the '''Sanatan Singh Sabha''' as the original [[Singh Sabha]] in 1873, "It was essentially conservative and [[Sanatan]] ('eternal', almost synonymous with Hinduism). The Sanatan Sikhs (Udasis, Nirmalas and the Namdharis) were for the first time challenged and eventually marginalised.".&lt;ref name="Sanatan Singh Sabha"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sikhism/sanatan.html | title=Sanatan Singh Sabha | publisher=University of Cumbria | date=1998 | accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Sanatan Sikhs refer to the Classical Sikhism as Sikhs to be a wider denomination of [[Sanatana Dharma]] by the individual who practices [[karma]] and Bhakti of the Almighty in any way for the achievement of Moksha, or spiritual liberation. Sikh groups have criticized the Sanatan Singh Sabha as having more in common with Hinduism than Sikhism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16277">The '''Sarmoung Brotherhood''' was an alleged [[esoteric]] [[Sufi]] brotherhood based in [[Asia]].  The reputed existence of the brotherhood was brought to light in the writings of [[George Gurdjieff]], a [[Greeks|Greek]]-[[Armenians|Armenian]] spiritual teacher. Some contemporary Sufi-related sources also claim to have made contact with the group although the earliest and primary source is Gurdjieff himself, leading some scholars to conclude the group was merely a fictional teaching device.&lt;ref name="sedgwick" /&gt;

==Name==
According to the author [[John G. Bennett]], a student and aide of [[G. I. Gurdjieff|George Gurdjieff]] who first mentioned the concept, the word ''sarmoung'' uses the [[Armenian language|Armenian]] pronunciation of the [[Farsi|Persian]] term ''sarman'', which may mean either "he who preserves the [[doctrine]] of [[Zoroaster]]" or "[[bee]]".&lt;ref name="bennett-making"&gt;Bennett, John G., ''Gurdjieff: Making of A New World'', pp 56-57, Bennett Pub. Co., 1992. {{ISBN|0-9621901-6-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the meaning, Bennett writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The word can be interpreted in three ways. It is the word for bee, which has always been a symbol of those who collect the precious 'honey' of traditional wisdom and preserve it for further generations. A collection of legends, well known in Armenian and Syrian circles with the title of ''The Bees'', was revised by Mar Salamon, a Nestorian Archimandrite in the thirteenth century. ''The Bees'' refers to a mysterious power transmitted from the time of Zoroaster and made manifest in the time of Christ.... ''Man'' is Persian meaning as the quality transmitted by heredity and hence a distinguished family or race. It can be the repository of an heirloom or tradition. The word ''sar'' means head, both literally and in the sense of principal or chief. The combination ''sarman'' would thus mean the chief repository of the tradition." Yet another possibility was "those whose heads have been purified", in other words: the enlightened.&lt;ref name="bennett-making" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in the Persian language, 'sarman' has no meaning&lt;ref&gt;http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=steingass&amp;query=sarman&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8&lt;/ref&gt;, and the actual word for a bee is 'zebh' or plural 'zobabeh'.&lt;ref&gt;http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=hayyim&amp;query=%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B1&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gurdjieff's account==
The Brotherhood was also sought by Georges Gurdjieff on his journeys (pre-1912) through [[Southwest Asia|Southwest]] and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="bennett-making" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;Moore, James, ''Gurdjieff: The Anatomy of a Myth: A Biography'', Element Books, 1993. {{ISBN|1-85230-450-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the contents of an old letter written by a monk which he had obtained, Gurdjieff writes:-

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Our worthy Father Telvant has at last succeeded in learning the truth about the Sarmoung Brotherhood. Their organisation actually did exist near the town of Siranoush, and fifty years ago, soon after the migration of peoples, they also migrated and settled in the valley of Izrumin, three days journey from Nivssi...." Then the letter went on about other matters.

What struck us most was the word "Sarmoung", which we had come across several times in the book called "Merkhavat". This word is the name of a famous esoteric school which, according to tradition, was founded in Babylon as far back as 2500 BC, and which was known to have existed somewhere in Mesopotamia up to the sixth or seventh century AD; but about its further existence one could not obtain anywhere the least information.

This school was said to have possessed great knowledge, containing the key to many secret mysteries

Many times had Pogossian and I talked of this school and dreamed of finding out something authentic about it, and now suddenly we found it mentioned in this parchment! We were greatly excited.&lt;ref name="meetings"&gt;Gurdjieff, G. I., ''Meetings with Remarkable Men'', Penguin (Non-Classics), 1991. {{ISBN|0-14-019037-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gurdjieff goes on to relate the Sarmoung to the [[Nestorian]]s, descendants of the ancient [[Byzantine]], their expulsion from [[Mesopotamia]] and the city of [[Ninevah]].

Gurdjiieff's experiences on these journeys, and a sketchy account of his somewhat mysterious relationship with the Sarmoung Brotherhood, can be found in his autobiography ''[[Meetings with Remarkable Men]]''. He claims he made contact with a representative of the Sarmoung through his friend, the [[Dervish]] Bogga Eddin (Bahauddin), in [[Bukhara]]. The chief monastery of the society was said to be located somewhere in the heart of Asia, about twelve days' journey from Bukhara by horse and donkey. Once he arrived at the monastery, Gurdjieff discovered that his old friend [[Prince Lubovedsky]] was already there. The Prince tells Gurdjieff that he had met a representative of the Sarmoung at the house of the [[Aga Khan]] in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="meetings" /&gt; During his stay at the monastery, Gurdjieff recalls seeing a complex and ancient tree-like apparatus used to indicate bodily postures and train temple dancers.

Gurdjieff's attempts to establish a link between the Brotherhood, ancient [[Sumer]], and even "pre-sand [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]", was an intriguing attempt at acquiring esoteric knowledge that had been passed down from antiquity.&lt;ref name="bennett-making" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gilbert"&gt;Gilbert, Adrian G., ''Magi: The Quest for a Secret Tradition'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 1996. {{ISBN|0-7475-3100-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major Martin's account ==
According to ''Account of the Sarmoun Brotherhood'' (1966, 1982) by Major Desmond R. Martin, a major centre of the contemporary Sarmoun Brotherhood was in the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains of northern [[Afghanistan]]. Major Martin was an associate of the writer and Sufi teacher, [[Idries Shah]].&lt;ref name="account"&gt;Martin, Major Desmond R., "Account of the Sarmoun Brotherhood", ''Documents on Contemporary Dervish Communities'', a symposium collected, edited and arranged by Roy Weaver Davidson, Octagon Press 1966, 1982. {{ISBN|0863040152}}. First publication: Major Desmond R. Martin, The Editor of The Lady, "Below the Hindu Kush", ''The Lady,'' vol. CLX11, No. 4210, December 9, 1965, p. 870.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the account, the motto of the Sarmouni is said to be "Work produces a Sweet Essence" (Amal misazad yak zaati shirin), work being not only work for God and for others but also self-work. In relation to this, it is maintained that just as the bee accumulates honey, so the Sarmouni accumulate, store and preserve what they term "true knowledge" (which is equally seen as existing as a positive commodity and associated with the spiritual gift or energy of [[Barakah|Baraka]]).&lt;ref name="account" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ernest"&gt;Scott, Ernest, ''The People of the Secret'', p74, Octagon Press, London, 1985. {{ISBN|0-86304-038-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In times of need this is released once more into the world through specially trained emissaries.&lt;ref name="account" /&gt; He describes a tree-like, multi jointed apparatus, similar to one described by Gurdjieff, and also a "No-Koonja" or nine-pointed figure, similar to Gurdjieff's [[Fourth Way enneagram|Enneagram]]. The account hints that the central Asian activities of the Sarmoun are to be shut down and the organisation shifted to the west, and mentions an absent chief of the order, the Surkaur, who lives in a place called Aubshaur or "waterfall" (Another account of a visit to a remote monastery, published anonymously in the Times, links the Sarkar to Idries Shah&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayofsecretpeople.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/elusive-guardians-of-ancient-secrets.html Elusive Guardians of the Ancient Secrets]&lt;/ref&gt;). Martin's account ends with a description of a symbolic ritual whose theme is the revival of the "dead letter" of traditional teaching.

== O. M. Burke's and Idries Shah's accounts ==
A lengthy account of an encounter with the Sarmouni is given in ''[[Among the Dervishes]]'' (1973) by Omar Michael Burke, an associate of (or pen name of &lt;ref&gt;Moore, James (1986). "Neo-Sufism: The Case of Idries Shah". Religion Today 3&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Idries Shah]]. He takes the term "Sarmouni" to be synonymous with the [[Amu Darya|Amudaria]] dervishes. He describes the Sarmouni as a diffuse set of groups, rather than being located in a single monastery. Some groups have no permanent headquarters and meet in the open or private houses. In some cases, whole villages blend Sarmouni practices with their day-to-day lives. He describes them as having a practical orientation, and avoiding mystification and personality-cults. They occasionally display [[extrasensory perception]]s, but do not attribute great significance to them. He reports meeting a nonagenarian with memories of "Jurjizada" (Gurdjieff). He also says they owe their allegiance to the "Studious King" (a literal translation of Idries Shah's name), and agrees with Major Martin that their teaching has been exported and adapted to the West. (He mentions the [[Azimiyya]], a modern international Sufi order).

=== Sarmoung teachings according to Idries Shah ===
[[Idries Shah]] himself does not describe any personal contact with the Sarmoung, but mentions the "Sarmouni" several times in his writings. For instance, in ''[[Tales of the Dervishes]]'' he attributes a teaching story to a Sarmouni called Pir-i-Do-Sara (d. 1790). He also offers a following "Sarmouni recital", beginning:-

{{quote|"He who knows and does not know that he knows: he is asleep. Let him become
one, whole. Let him be awakened.

He who has known but does not know: let him see once more the beginning
of all.

He who does not wish to know, and yet says that he needs to know: let
him be guided to safety and to light.

He who does not know, and knows that he does not know: let him, through
this knowledge, know".

==Other accounts==

In ''Studies in Comparative Religion'' (Winter 1974), it is said that according to the Armenian book ''[[Merkhavat]]'', the Sarmoung Brotherhood, also referred to as the 'Inner Circle of Humanity', originated in ancient [[Babylon]] circa 2500 BC,&lt;ref name="comp-religion"&gt;''Studies in Comparative Religion'', pp 25, 214, Tomorrow Publications, Winter 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; at around the time the Egyptians built the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Ouspensky Foundation state that the brotherhood was active in the golden Babylonian time of Hammurabi (1728-1686 BC) and is connected with [[Zoroaster]], the teacher of [[Pythagoras]] (born c. 580 BC–572 BC, died c. 500 BC–490 BC). According to the Foundation, Pythagoras stayed for twelve years in Babylon.&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;[http://www.ouspensky.info/gurdjieffeng.htm Ouspensky Foundation: History of the Work of Gurdjieff]. Retrieved on 2008-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Merkabah mysticism]] is in fact a form of Jewish esotericism, which Gurdjieff possibly encountered in an Armenian translation).

In ''The Masters of Wisdom'', J.G. Bennett states that the Sarman left Babylon before the arrival of the [[Alexander the Great]] (who reigned 336-323 BC), moved up the Tigris and made their headquarters in the abandoned capital of the [[Assyria]]n Kings, close to modern-day [[Mosul]] in northern [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="bennett-masters"&gt;Bennett, John G., ''The Masters of Wisdom'', pp 57, 64, Bennett Books, 1995, {{ISBN|1-881408-01-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Gurdjieff in the Light of Tradition'' (2002), the [[Perrenialist]] [[Whitall Perry]] wrote that Gurdjieff believed that the northern [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders could well be under the hidden direction of the [[Khwajagan]] - the 'Masters of Wisdom' - themselves in turn delegated by the Sarman 'Inner Circle', the 'Assembly of the Living Saints of the Earth'.&lt;ref name="perry"&gt;Perry, Whitall N., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=P466D9-bXpEC Gurdjieff in the Light of Tradition]'', p7, Sophia Perennis, 2002. {{ISBN|0-900588-75-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The People of the Secret'', [[Edward Campbell (journalist)|Edward Campbell]] (writing as Ernest Scott), another associate of Idries Shah, describes studies in extrasensory perception being undertaken in the contemporary Sarmoun monastery in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="ernest" /&gt;

The Canadian diplomat and Gurdjieffian [[James George (diplomat)|James George]] has speculated, on the basis of the similar name and location, that [[Surmang]], a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] monastery currently within Chinese borders may be real basis of the Sarmoung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fordham|first1=Walter|title=Interview with James George: June 27th, 2003|url=http://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_15.html|website=Chronicles of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=October 2003|quote=Gurdjieff spent three and a half years in Tibet. He wrote ... that he was taken to a central Asian monastery in Kashmir or Tibet called a monastery of the Sarmoung brotherhood. Now, Surmang, the seat of Trungpa's lineage, is just a transposition of vowels, which I think, may conceal where Gurdjieff received much of his teaching.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surmang has been more recently associated with the renowned and controversial [[Kagyu]] teacher [[Chogyam Trungpa]]. In 2007, Buddhist priest Rev. José M. Tirado presented a paper to the All &amp; Everything Conference in Loutraki, Greece detailing the probable Buddhist influences on Gurdjieff´s teachings, and linking "Sarmoun" to the Surmang monastery, in "Beelzebub´s Buddhas".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.endlesssearch.co.uk/philo_buddhist_influences_tirado.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skepticism==
[[Mark Sedgwick]], the coordinator of the Unit for Arab and Islamic Studies at [[Aarhus University]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although few commentators in Gurdjieff would put it so bluntly, it seems clear to me that the Sarmoung are entirely imaginary. No Sufi ''tariqa'' of such a name is known, and in fact "Sarmoung" is a typically Gurdjieffian fantastical name. It is immediately obvious to anyone who knows anything about regular Sufism that there is nothing remotely Sufi about the Sarmoung Order described by Gurdjieff.&lt;ref name="sedgwick"&gt;Sedgwick, Mark. "European Neo-Sufi Movements in the Inter-war Period" appearing in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7cjFFgvUdDUC Islam in Inter-War Europe]'', edited by Natalie Clayer and Eric Germain. Hurst, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nathalie Clayer-Eric Germain ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7cjFFgvUdDUC Islam In Inter-War Europe]'', p. 208, Columbia University Press, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-231-70100-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[James Moore (Cornish author)|James Moore]], in his biography of Gurdjieff, writes
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Gurdjieff's claim to have found and entered 'the chief Sarmoung Monastery' is, in effect, a litmus test, distinguishing literal minds from those preferring allegory.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, J. Gurdjieff, ''The Anatomy of a Myth''. Element books, 1991, p31&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sewri Christian Cemetery''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: शिवडी ख्रिस्ती  स्मशान भूमि  ''Sewrī Kristi smashan bhumi'') in [[Sewri]], [[Mumbai]], [[India]], was established by [[Arthur Crawford]], the first [[Municipal Commissioner of Mumbai|Municipal Commissioner of Bombay]] as a location for European burials. The land was acquired from the Agri-Horticulture Society's gardens in 1865.
The bodies of Commonwealth military service personnel buried in the cemetery during the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s were all exhumed and reburied at [[Khadki|Kirkee War Cemetery]] where permanent maintenance by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] could be assured,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/2016603/BOMBAY%20(SEWRI)%20CEMETERY] CWGC Cemetery Report.&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of a Second World War soldier of the [[Women's Auxiliary Corps (India)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2191568/FOLEY,%20THELMA] CWGC Casualty record.&lt;/ref&gt; whose grave is still registered and maintained by the commission.

==Role-playing games==
===Bushido===
In ''[[Bushido (role-playing game)|Bushido]]'', a [[role-playing game]] published in 1981 by [[Fantasy Games Unlimited]], Shugenja are portrayed as [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizards]].

===Legend of the Five Rings===
In the ''[[Legend of the Five Rings]]'' [[collectible card game]], ''shugenja'' are [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]-users, similar to wizards. Their spells are given power by the five different varieties of [[kami]] that can be found in [[Rokugan]]. Their magic is referred to as Elemental Magic, as opposed to Bloodspeakers who use Blood Magic. In the [[Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game|role-playing game]], being a ''shugenja'' is one of the main alternatives in character creation.

===Dungeons &amp; Dragons===
The [[Shugenja (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)#Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons|shugenja]] (with the alternate spelling ''shukenja'') was introduced in the original [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons|first edition]] ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' book as a subclass of cleric.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Gygax|Gygax, Gary]], with [[David Cook (game designer)|David Cook]], and [[François Marcela-Froideval]]. ''Oriental Adventures'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; A version of this class (also called [[Shugenja (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|shugenja]]) was incorporated into ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' in the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd edition|third edition]]  ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' [[sourcebook]], and revised in the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Dungeons &amp; Dragons v3.5|3.5 edition]] sourcebook ''[[Complete Divine]]''.

[[File:Soleb2.jpg|thumb|Architrave with the [[cartouche]] of Amenhotep III in the Soleb temple]]
'''Soleb''' is an ancient town in [[Nubia]], today's [[Sudan]]. The site is located north of the third 
[[Cataracts of the Nile|cataract of the Nile]], on the western side of the Nile. It was discovered and described by 
[[Karl Richard Lepsius]] in 1844.

==Necropolis==
Soleb is also the location of a vast [[necropolis]] with small tomb chapels decorated with [[pyramid]]s. The earliest 
royal tombs date to the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], whereas some belong to the 
[[Ramesside period|Ramesside]] and [[Meroitic period|Meroitic]] periods.

==Amarna Period==
During the [[Amarna Period]] (Mid 18th Dynasty), several pharaohs attended to Soleb, such as [[Amenhotep III]], 
[[Akhenaten]], [[Tutankhamun]], and [[Ay]].

===Amenhotep III===
A large [[temple]] made of [[sandstone]] was founded here by Amenhotep III. It is the southern-most temple currently 
known to have been built by this pharaoh. The temple was consecrated to the deity [[Amun Re]] and to the pharaoh 
depicted deified with ram-horns. The architect may have been [[Amenhotep, son of Hapu]].

At [[Sedeinga]], a companion temple was built by Amenhotep III to [[Queen Tiye]] as a manifestation of the [[Eye of Ra]].

The so-called [[Prudhoe Lions]] originally stood as guardian figures at this temple inscribed with the name of Amenhotep 
III. They depict a lioness, as symbols of [[Sekhmet]], a major deity who protected the pharaohs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfdas.com/IMG/pdf/soleb_sedeinga.pdf Soleb &amp; Sedeinga] Retrieved 2018-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Akhenaten===
[[File:Soleb3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Prisoners from the [[hypostyle hall]] of the Soleb temple]]
During the reign of Akhenaten, he initially is shown worshiping his father and Amen at the temple. But later, 
he re-dedicates the temple to Aten.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Tutankhamen===
During the reign of Tutankhamen, the religious reforms of his father (Akhenaten) were reversed and re-dedicated 
the temple to Amen-Ra. He finished the second granite lion and inscribed his name on the Prudhoe Lions.

'''''The Heathen Woman's Friend''''' (1869-1896; renamed '''''Woman’s Missionary Friend''''', 1896-1940) was a Christian women's monthly newspaper. Established in May 1869, it was published by the [[Woman's Foreign Missionary Society]] of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The monthly magazine describe conditions in the mission fields of the church, document the work of the society, and provide assistance to missionaries. ''The Heathen Woman's Friend'' was launched with volume 1, number 1 in May 1869. Its final issue, volume 27, number 6, was issued December 1895. The publication was relaunched as the ''Woman's Missionary Friend'' with volume 27, number 7 on January 1896, and ended with volume 73, number 7 in August 1940.

The paper was able to pay its expenses and gave large sums to the Society. From 1882 to 1893, it contributed $26,000 to other forms of church work, and aided in carrying the miscellaneous literature published by the Society, the annual reports, uniform studies, maps of mission fields, life membership certificates for adults and for children, and a great variety of missionary leaflets. 

==Organization==
At the very beginning of the Society, it was proposed that a monthly paper be issued, and the following prospectus was printed: "The" paper will be devoted more especially to the interests of the work among heathen women, and will be filled with interesting facts and incidents illustrating that work, furnished by those laboring in heathen lands. Information will be given concerning the customs and social life of the people, the various obstacles to be overcome in their Christianization, and the success which attends the various departments of missionary labor among them. The design is to furnish just such a paper as will be read with interest by all the friends of the cause, and one which will assist in enlisting the sympathies of the children also, and educate them more fully in the missionary work. The price of the paper .will be only thirty cents per annum, so that it will be within the reach of all."{{sfn|Baker|1895|p=72}}

==History==
[[File:The Heathen Woman's Friend 1891.png|thumb|''Heathen Woman's Friend'' 1869-1895]]
===1869===
After the decision was reached to publish a paper, [[Harriet Merrick Warren]] was selected as editor. She was then only 25 years old. At that time, papers and magazines conducted by women were something of a novelty, the field new and untried. She immediately went to work, and the first issue of the paper, eight pages, appeared in May, 1869.{{sfn|Tiedemann|2016|p=235}} Lewis Flanders stood ready with US$500 to meet deficiencies, if at the end of the year it was needed. Others also promised financial assistance. At the close of the first year, its subscription list had reached 4,000; it paid all running expenses, and had a margin on hand. It was then enlarged to 12 pages. James P. Magee acted as general agent.{{sfn|Baker|1895|p=72-77}} 

===1870s===
A 20,000 edition was required in 1870. The subscription price was raised from $0.30 to $0.35, and [[Lydia Hill Daggett]] was appointed agent. The July number in 1871 contained a map, giving all the missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church in India, in their relation to each other and to large cities. It was prepared by [[Isabella Thoburn]], and was the first cartographic view of these missions ever printed for the Methodist Episcopal Church.{{sfn|Baker|1895|p=72-77}}

In July, 1872, four more pages were added, and it became a 16-page paper. Its circulation reached 25,000. During the first seven years, a strong corps of contributing editors was annually elected. In May, 1872, the paper appeared with its first illustration. The engraving was that of the Mission House and Orphanage at [[Bareilly]]. Thereafter, this was a prominent feature. In 1875, the paper was increased to 24 pages, with a new heading, and the subscription price was raised to $0.50. In that year, a new feature was added, called the "Home Department," the material being contributed by the Branch Secretaries.{{sfn|Baker|1895|p=72-77}} During the first five years of publication, the paper focused primarily on India and China.{{sfn|Pruitt|2005|p=177}} Volume VIII began with the addition of [[Mary Bannister Willard]] as editor of the Children's Department. She filled this position  for two years, and was then reluctantly excused. During the 10 year, owing to financial depression, the subscription decreased to 13,388. Three years later, the number again reached 20,000.{{sfn|Baker|1895|p=72-77}} From 1878, it furnished the outline of what was entitled the "Uniform Study" of each month, by means of which the women of the Societies united in pursuing a systematic course of study of missionary subjects.{{sfn|Baker|1895|p=72-77}}

===1880s===
In November, 1882, Daggett's resignation was accepted, and  [[Pauline J. Walden]], the publishing agent, was again appointed. The paper published full reports of the General Executive Committee in annual session, and the acknowledgment of all moneys to the Society through the Branch Treasurers, and kept the thread of the history of the work on every mission field abroad, as well as much of the detail of the work by the Auxiliaries at home.{{sfn|Baker|1895|p=72-77}} The German language edition, ''Heiden Frauen Freund'', was established in 1885.&lt;ref name="Cassidy2006" /&gt;  Four more pages were added in 1886.

===1890s===
The February number of 1893 contained an unwritten page with the name "Harriet Merrick Warren," and underneath two dates, "September 15, 1843—January 7, 1893", announcing her death. For 24 years, she had been the newspaper's leader. She had developed the paper so that it soon took rank as one of the model missionary periodicals of the world, and had reached the largest number of subscribers of any woman's missionary magazine published at that time. After the death of Warren, her daughter, [[Mary Warren-Ayars]], was appointed to take the mother's place, which she accepted.{{sfn|Baker|1895|p=72-77}}  In July 1893, the form of the paper was changed, as had long been contemplated, to that of a magazine, and contained 30 pages. In the Young Woman's Department was included a column of bright notes about "Other Girls," carrying out a desire expressed by Warren. For greater convenience, the table of contents and the columns containing information about Branch officers and the organization's other publications were brought together on the page next to the cover.{{sfn|Woman's Foreign Missionary Society|1893|p=12}} Ayars carried on the work until the close of the year, declining a further appointment.{{sfn|Baker|1895|p=72-77}} At the General Executive Committee meeting in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], in November, 1893, [[Louise Manning Hodgkins]] was unanimously elected to the position of editor.&lt;ref name="Cassidy2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cassidy|first1=Cheryl M.|title=Bringing the "New Woman" to the Mission Site: Louise Manning Hodgkins and the ''Heathen Woman's Friend''|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/202159|journal=American Periodicals: A Journal of History, Criticism, and Bibliography|volume=16|issue=2|year=2006|pp=172-99|publisher=Project MUSE|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Woman's Missionary Friend 1896.png|thumb|Rebranded in 1896 as ''Woman's Missionary Friend'']]
Hodgkins introduced some new features, a department of "Family News," also a "Post-office Box," and brought out some special numbers. The first was in March, 1894 —the 25th anniversary number— which was embellished with photo-engravings of the founders, Mrs. E. W. Parker ([[Lois Lee Parker]] and Mrs. Wm. Butler ([[Clementina Rowe Butler]]); and first missionaries, Isabella Thoburn and Dr. Clara Swain. The subscriptions in 1895 were nearly 22,000.{{sfn|Baker|1895|p=72-77}} But some considered the newspaper's name to be controversial and so a name change was discussed in St. Louis in 1896, with supporters claiming that it "expresses so much" while others argued that it was a "misnomer", even a "hinderance to their work".{{sfn|Reeves-Ellington|Sklar|Shemo|2009|p=}} After discussion, it was renamed ''Woman’s Missionary Friend''.&lt;ref name="Campbell2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Barbara E.|title=That Handful of Women|url=http://www.unitedmethodistwomen.org/news/that-handful-of-women|publisher=United Methodist Women|accessdate=5 November 2016|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Butler, a Boston artist, would design the cover.{{sfn|Woman's Foreign Missionary Society|1895|p=157}}

By 1911, the publisher was Annie G. Bailey, with Elizabeth C. Northup as Editor; the subscription price was $0.50 per year.

The '''Theban alphabet''' is a [[writing system]] with unknown origins which first came into publication in the 16th century.

==Publication history==
It was first published in [[Johannes Trithemius]]'s ''Polygraphia'' (1518), in which it was attributed to [[Honorius of Thebes]] "as [[Pietro d'Abano]] testifies in his greater fourth book". However, it is not known to be extant in any of the known writings attributed to D'Abano (1250-1316). Trithemius' student [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1486–1535) included it in his ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy|De Occulta Philosophia]]'' (Book III, chap. 29, 1531).&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1531). ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also not known to be found in any manuscripts of the writings of [[Honorius of Thebes]] (i.e. ''Liber Iuratus Honorii'', or ''[[The Sworn Book of Honorius]]''), with the exception of the composite manuscript found in London, [[British Library]] Manuscript Sloane 3853, which however openly identifies Agrippa as its source.

==Uses and correlations==
It is also known as the '''Honorian alphabet''' or the '''Runes of Honorius''' after the legendary [[magus]] (Theban is not, however, a [[Runes|runic alphabet]]), or the '''witches' alphabet''' due to its use in modern [[Wicca]] and other forms of [[witchcraft]] as one of many [[substitution ciphers]] to hide magical writings such as the contents of a [[Book of Shadows]] from prying eyes. The Theban alphabet bears little resemblance to other [[alphabet]]s, and has not been found in any previous publications prior that of Trithemius. 
 
There is one-to-one correspondence between Theban and the letters in the old [[Latin alphabet]]. The modern characters J, U and W are not represented, and in modern usage these are transliterated using the Theban characters for I, V and VV. Theban letters only exist in a single [[case (orthography)|case]]. This suggests an origin for Theban as a [[cipher]] [[calque]]d on Latin, along with the various [[alphabets]] described by Trithemius and Agrippa, based on either [[Latin]] or [[Hebrew]].

[[Eric S. Raymond]], an American software developer and author, has created a draft proposal for adding the Theban alphabet to the [[Universal Coded Character Set]] / [[Unicode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/unicode/theban/ |title=Proposal to add the Theban Alphabet to ISO/IEC 10646 |last=Raymond |first=Eric S. |date=2002-02-26 |website=Eric S.

The '''United States Declaration of Independence''' is the statement adopted by the [[Second Continental Congress]] meeting at the Pennsylvania State House (now known as [[Independence Hall]]) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on July 4, 1776. The Declaration announced that the [[Thirteen Colonies]] at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain would regard themselves as thirteen independent sovereign states, no longer under British rule. With the Declaration, these new states took a collective first step toward forming the United States of America. The declaration was signed by representatives from [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay]], [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Province of New Jersey|New Jersey]], [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], [[Delaware Colony|Delaware]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]].

The [[Lee Resolution]] for independence was passed on July 2 with no opposing votes. The [[Committee of Five]] had drafted the Declaration to be ready when Congress voted on independence. [[John Adams]], a leader in pushing for independence, had persuaded the committee to select [[Thomas Jefferson]] to compose the original draft of the document,&lt;ref name="digitalhistory"&gt;[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/active_learning/explorations/revolution/revolution_declaringindependence.cfm "Declaring Independence"], ''Revolutionary War'', Digital History, University of Houston. From Adams' notes: "Why will you not? You ought to do it." "I will not." "Why?" "Reasons enough." "What can be your reasons?" "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." "Well," said Jefferson, "if you are decided, I will do as well as I can." "Very well. When you have drawn it up, we will have a meeting."&lt;/ref&gt; which Congress edited to produce the final version. The Declaration was a formal explanation of why Congress had voted to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]].  Adams wrote to his wife [[Abigail Adams|Abigail]], "The Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masshist.org/digitaladams/archive/doc?id=L17760703jasecond Letter from John Adams to Abigail Adams, 3 July 1776]&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– although Independence Day is actually celebrated on July 4, the date that the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved.

After ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms. It was initially published as the printed [[Physical history of the United States Declaration of Independence#Dunlap broadside|Dunlap broadside]] that was widely distributed and read to the public. The source copy used for this printing has been lost and may have been a copy in Thomas Jefferson's hand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boyd (1976), ''The Declaration of Independence: The Mystery of the Lost Original'', p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson's original draft is preserved at the [[Library of Congress]], complete with changes made by John Adams and [[Benjamin Franklin]], as well as Jefferson's notes of changes made by Congress.  The best-known version of the Declaration is a signed copy that is displayed at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in Washington, D.C., and which is popularly regarded as the official document. This engrossed copy was ordered by Congress on July 19 and signed primarily on August 2.&lt;ref&gt;

The sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry. The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and by asserting certain natural and legal rights, including a right of revolution. Its original purpose was to announce independence, and references to the text of the Declaration were few in the following years. [[Abraham Lincoln]] made it the centerpiece of his policies and his rhetoric, as in the [[Gettysburg Address]] of 1863. Since then, it has become a well-known statement on human rights, particularly its second sentence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has been called "one of the best-known sentences in the English language",&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Lucas, "Justifying America: The Declaration of Independence as a Rhetorical Document", in Thomas W. Benson, ed., ''American Rhetoric: Context and Criticism'', Carbondale, Illinois: Southern Illinois University Press, 1989, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; containing "the most potent and consequential words in American history".&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, ''American Creation'', 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by Lincoln, who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy and argued that it is a statement of principles through which the [[United States Constitution]] should be interpreted.&lt;ref name="McPherson126"&gt;McPherson, ''Second American Revolution'', 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration of Independence inspired many similar documents in other countries, the first being the 1789 ''Declaration of Flanders'' issued during the [[Brabant Revolution]] in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. It also served as the primary model for numerous declarations of independence in Europe and Latin America, as well as Africa (Liberia) and Oceania (New Zealand) during the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=David| last=Armitage| title=The Declaration of Independence: A Global History| date=2007| publisher=Harvard University Press| location=Cambridge, Massachusetts| isbn=0-674-02282-3| pages=113–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Thomas Jefferson rev.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the Declaration]]

{{quote|text=Believe me, dear Sir: there is not in the British empire a man who more cordially loves a union with Great Britain than I do. But, by the God that made me, I will cease to exist before I yield to a connection on such terms as the British Parliament propose; and in this, I think I speak the sentiments of America.|sign=[[Thomas Jefferson]], November 29, 1775&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the time that the Declaration of Independence was adopted in July 1776, the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and Great Britain had been at war for more than a year. Relations had been deteriorating between the colonies and the mother country since 1763.  [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] enacted a series of measures to increase revenue from the colonies, such as the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]] and the [[Townshend Acts]] of 1767. Parliament believed that these acts were a legitimate means of having the colonies pay their fair share of the costs to keep them in the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Christie and Labaree, ''Empire or Independence'', 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many colonists, however, had developed a different conception of the empire. The colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, and colonists argued that Parliament had [[No taxation without representation|no right to levy taxes]] upon them. This tax dispute was part of a larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the [[British Constitution]] and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 162.&lt;/ref&gt; The orthodox British view, dating from the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, was that Parliament was the [[Parliamentary sovereignty|supreme authority]] throughout the empire, and so, by definition, anything that Parliament did was constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 200–02.&lt;/ref&gt; In the colonies, however, the idea had developed that the British Constitution recognized certain [[natural and legal rights|fundamental rights]] that no government could violate, not even Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 180–82.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Townshend Acts, some essayists even began to question whether Parliament had any [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] jurisdiction in the colonies at all.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Anticipating the arrangement of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]],&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 224–25.&lt;/ref&gt; by 1774 American writers such as [[Samuel Adams]], [[James Wilson]], and Thomas Jefferson were arguing that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only, and that the colonies, which had their own legislatures, were connected to the rest of the empire only through their allegiance to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 241–42. The writings in question include Wilson's ''Considerations on the Authority of Parliament'' and Jefferson's ''[[A Summary View of the Rights of British America]]'' (both 1774), as well as Samuel Adams's 1768 [[Massachusetts Circular Letter|Circular Letter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congress convenes===
The issue of Parliament's authority in the colonies became a crisis after Parliament passed the [[Coercive Acts]] (known as the Intolerable Acts in the colonies) in 1774 to punish the colonists for the [[Gaspee Affair]] of 1772 and the [[Boston Tea Party]] of 1773. Many colonists saw the Coercive Acts as a violation of the British Constitution and thus a threat to the liberties of all of [[British America]], so the [[First Continental Congress]] convened in Philadelphia in September 1774 to coordinate a response. Congress organized a [[Continental Association|boycott of British goods]] and [[Petition to the King (1774)|petitioned the king]] for repeal of the acts. These measures were unsuccessful because King George and the ministry of Prime Minister [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] were determined to enforce parliamentary supremacy in America. As the king wrote to North in November 1774, "blows must decide whether they are to be subject to this country or independent".&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 168; Ferling, ''Leap in the Dark'', 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most colonists still hoped for reconciliation with Great Britain, even after fighting began in the [[American Revolutionary War]] at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] in April 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 13; Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 318.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Continental Congress]] convened at the [[Independence Hall (United States)|Pennsylvania State House]] in Philadelphia in May 1775, and some delegates hoped for eventual independence, but no one yet advocated declaring it.&lt;ref&gt;Middlekauff, ''Glorious Cause'', 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Many colonists no longer believed that Parliament had any sovereignty over them, yet they still professed loyalty to King George, who they hoped would intercede on their behalf. They were disappointed in late 1775 when the king rejected Congress's [[Olive Branch Petition|second petition]], issued a [[Proclamation of Rebellion]], and announced before Parliament on October 26 that he was considering "friendly offers of foreign assistance" to suppress the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 25. The text of the 1775 [[Speech from the Throne|king's speech]] is [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/rbpe:@field(DOCID+@lit(rbpe1440150a)) online], published by the [[American Memory]] project.&lt;/ref&gt; A pro-American minority in Parliament warned that the government was driving the colonists toward independence.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toward independence==
[[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' was published in January 1776, just as it became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined to act as a conciliator.&lt;ref&gt;Rakove, ''Beginnings of National Politics'', 88–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Paine had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating [[republicanism]] as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule.&lt;ref&gt;Christie and Labaree, ''Empire or Independence'', 270; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Common Sense'' made a persuasive and impassioned case for independence, which had not yet been given serious intellectual consideration in the American colonies. Paine connected independence with Protestant beliefs as a means to present a distinctly American political identity, thereby stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss,&lt;ref&gt;Rakove, ''Beginnings of National Politics'', 89; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after its publication.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Independence Hall Assembly Room.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.90|The Assembly Room in Philadelphia's [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]], where the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence]]

Some colonists still held out hope for reconciliation, but developments in early 1776 further strengthened public support for independence. In February 1776, colonists learned of Parliament's passage of the [[Prohibitory Act]], which established a blockade of American ports and declared American ships to be enemy vessels. [[John Adams]], a strong supporter of independence, believed that Parliament had effectively declared American independence before Congress had been able to. Adams labeled the Prohibitory Act the "Act of Independency", calling it "a compleat&lt;!-- sic --&gt; Dismemberment of the British Empire".&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 209; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Support for declaring independence grew even more when it was confirmed that King George had hired German mercenaries to use against his American subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this growing popular support for independence, Congress lacked the clear authority to declare it. Delegates had been elected to Congress by 13 different governments, which included extralegal conventions, ad hoc committees, and elected assemblies, and they were bound by the instructions given to them. Regardless of their personal opinions, delegates could not vote to declare independence unless their instructions permitted such an action.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Several colonies, in fact, expressly prohibited their delegates from taking any steps towards separation from Great Britain, while other delegations had instructions that were ambiguous on the issue;&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 30.&lt;/ref&gt; consequently, advocates of independence sought to have the Congressional instructions revised. For Congress to declare independence, a majority of delegations would need authorization to vote for it, and at least one colonial government would need to specifically instruct its delegation to propose a declaration of independence in Congress. Between April and July 1776, a "complex political war"&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; was waged to bring this about.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 671; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revising instructions===
In the campaign to revise Congressional instructions, many Americans formally expressed their support for separation from Great Britain in what were effectively state and local declarations of independence. Historian [[Pauline Maier]] identifies more than ninety such declarations that were issued throughout the Thirteen Colonies from April to July 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 48, and Appendix A, which lists the state and local declarations.&lt;/ref&gt; These "declarations" took a variety of forms. Some were formal written instructions for Congressional delegations, such as the [[Halifax Resolves]] of April 12, with which North Carolina became the first colony to explicitly authorize its delegates to vote for independence.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 678–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Others were legislative acts that officially ended British rule in individual colonies, such as the Rhode Island legislature declaring its independence from Great Britain on May 4, the first colony to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 679; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Many "declarations" were resolutions adopted at town or county meetings that offered support for independence. A few came in the form of jury instructions, such as the statement issued on April 23, 1776, by Chief Justice [[William Henry Drayton]] of South Carolina: "the law of the land authorizes me to declare ... that ''George'' the Third, King of ''Great Britain'' ... has no authority over us, and we owe no obedience to him."&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 69–72, quoted on 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these declarations are now obscure, having been overshadowed by the declaration approved by Congress on July 2, and signed July 4.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 48. The modern scholarly consensus is that the best-known and earliest of the local declarations is most likely inauthentic, the [[Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence]], allegedly adopted in May 1775 (a full year before other local declarations); Maier, ''American Scripture'', 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some colonies held back from endorsing independence. Resistance was centered in the [[middle colonies]] of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware.&lt;ref name="Jensen, Founding, 682"&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 682.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of independence saw Pennsylvania as the key; if that colony could be converted to the pro-independence cause, it was believed that the others would follow.&lt;ref name="Jensen, Founding, 682"/&gt; On May 1, however, opponents of independence retained control of the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly|Pennsylvania Assembly]] in a special election that had focused on the question of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 683.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Congress passed a resolution on May 10 which had been promoted by John Adams and [[Richard Henry Lee]], calling on colonies without a "government sufficient to the [[wikt:exigency|exigencies]] of their affairs" to adopt new governments.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 684; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 37. For the full text of the May 10 resolve, see the [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc004109)): ''Journals of the Continental Congress''].&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution passed unanimously, and was even supported by Pennsylvania's [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]], the leader of the anti-independence faction in Congress, who believed that it did not apply to his colony.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 684.&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 15 preamble===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=This Day the Congress has passed the most important Resolution, that ever was taken in America.|source=—John Adams, May 15, 1776&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 159. The text of Adams's letter is [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(dg003624)):: online].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As was the custom, Congress appointed a committee to draft a [[preamble]] to explain the purpose of the resolution. John Adams wrote the preamble, which stated that because King George had rejected reconciliation and was hiring foreign mercenaries to use against the colonies, "it is necessary that the exercise of every kind of authority under the said crown should be totally suppressed".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 37; Jensen, ''Founding'', 684. For the full text of the May 15 preamble see the [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc004113)) ''Journals of the Continental Congress''].&lt;/ref&gt; Adams's preamble was meant to encourage the overthrow of the governments of Pennsylvania and Maryland, which were still under [[proprietary colony|proprietary]] governance.&lt;ref&gt;Rakove, ''National Politics'', 96; Jensen, ''Founding'', 684; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress passed the preamble on May 15 after several days of debate, but four of the middle colonies voted against it, and the Maryland delegation walked out in protest.&lt;ref&gt;Rakove, ''National Politics'', 97; Jensen, ''Founding'', 685.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams regarded his May 15 preamble effectively as an American declaration of independence, although a formal declaration would still have to be made.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lee's resolution===
{{main|Lee Resolution}}
On the same day that Congress passed Adams's radical preamble, the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|Virginia Convention]] set the stage for a formal Congressional declaration of independence. On May 15, the Convention instructed Virginia's congressional delegation "to propose to that respectable body to declare the United Colonies free and independent States, absolved from all allegiance to, or dependence upon, the Crown or Parliament of Great Britain".&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Evolution'', 18; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 63. The text of the May 15 Virginia resolution is [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/const/const02.htm online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620032827/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/const/const02.htm |date=June 20, 2008 }} at Yale Law School's Avalon Project.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with those instructions, [[Richard Henry Lee]] of Virginia presented a [[Lee Resolution|three-part resolution]] to Congress on June 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{wdl|109}} |author=Jefferson, Thomas |date=July 4, 1776 |title=Declaration of Independence. In Congress, July 4, 1776, a Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress Assembled |work=World Digital Library |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=July 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion was seconded by John Adams, calling on Congress to declare independence, form foreign alliances, and prepare a plan of colonial confederation. The part of the resolution relating to declaring independence read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Resolved, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 41; Boyd, ''Evolution'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lee's resolution met with resistance in the ensuing debate. Opponents of the resolution conceded that reconciliation was unlikely with Great Britain, while arguing that declaring independence was premature, and that securing foreign aid should take priority.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 689–90; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the resolution countered that foreign governments would not intervene in an internal British struggle, and so a formal declaration of independence was needed before foreign aid was possible. All Congress needed to do, they insisted, was to "declare a fact which already exists".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 689; Armitage, ''Global History'', 33–34. The quotation is from Jefferson's notes; Boyd, ''Papers of Jefferson'', 1:311.&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates from Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and New York were still not yet authorized to vote for independence, however, and some of them threatened to leave Congress if the resolution were adopted. Congress, therefore, voted on June 10 to postpone further discussion of Lee's resolution for three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 42–43; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, Congress decided that a committee should prepare a document announcing and explaining independence in the event that Lee's resolution was approved when it was brought up again in July.

=== The final push ===
[[File:Writing the Declaration of Independence 1776 cph.3g09904.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|This idealized depiction of (left to right) Franklin, Adams, and Jefferson working on the Declaration was widely reprinted (by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]], 1900).&lt;ref&gt;Dupont and Onuf, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Support for a Congressional declaration of independence was consolidated in the final weeks of June 1776. On June 14, the Connecticut Assembly instructed its delegates to propose independence and, the following day, the legislatures of New Hampshire and Delaware authorized their delegates to declare independence.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 691–92.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pennsylvania, political struggles ended with the dissolution of the colonial assembly, and a new Conference of Committees under [[Thomas McKean]] authorized Pennsylvania's delegates to declare independence on June 18.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 106–07; Jensen, ''Founding'', 691.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Provincial Congress of New Jersey]] had been governing the province since January 1776; they resolved on June 15 that [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|Royal Governor]] [[William Franklin]] was "an enemy to the liberties of this country" and had him arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 692.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, they chose new delegates to Congress and empowered them to join in a declaration of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 693.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only Maryland and New York had yet to authorize independence towards the end of June. Previously, Maryland's delegates had walked out when the Continental Congress adopted Adams's radical May 15 preamble, and had sent to the [[Annapolis Convention (1774–1776)|Annapolis Convention]] for instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 694.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, the Annapolis Convention rejected Adams's preamble, instructing its delegates to remain against independence. But [[Samuel Chase]] went to Maryland and, thanks to local resolutions in favor of independence, was able to get the Annapolis Convention to change its mind on June 28.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 694–96; Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 96; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the New York delegates were unable to get revised instructions. When Congress had been considering the resolution of independence on June 8, the [[New York Provincial Congress]] told the delegates to wait.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 118; Jensen, ''Founding'', 698.&lt;/ref&gt; But on June 30, the Provincial Congress evacuated New York as British forces approached, and would not convene again until July 10. This meant that New York's delegates would not be authorized to declare independence until after Congress had made its decision.&lt;ref&gt;Friedenwald, ''Interpretation'', 119–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Draft and adoption==
{{main|Physical history of the United States Declaration of Independence}}
Political maneuvering was setting the stage for an official declaration of independence even while a document was being written to explain the decision. On June 11, 1776, Congress appointed a "[[Committee of Five]]" to draft a declaration, consisting of [[John Adams]] of Massachusetts, [[Benjamin Franklin]] of Pennsylvania, [[Thomas Jefferson]] of Virginia, [[Robert Livingston (1746-1813)|Robert R. Livingston]] of New York, and [[Roger Sherman]] of Connecticut. The committee left no minutes, so there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded; contradictory accounts were written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, too many years to be regarded as entirely reliable—although their accounts are frequently cited.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 97–105; Boyd, ''Evolution'', 21.&lt;/ref&gt; What is certain is that the committee discussed the general outline which the document should follow and decided that Jefferson would write the first draft.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Evolution'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee in general, and Jefferson in particular, thought that Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson and promised to consult with him personally.&lt;ref name="digitalhistory" /&gt; Considering Congress's busy schedule, Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days, and likely wrote the draft quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 104.&lt;/ref&gt; He then consulted the others and made some changes, and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations. The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28, 1776. The title of the document was "A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled."&lt;ref&gt;Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jefferson's+deskdetail.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.90|Portable writing desk that Jefferson used to draft and write the Declaration of Independence]]
Congress ordered that the draft "[[Table (parliamentary)|lie on the table]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 701.&lt;/ref&gt;  For two days, Congress methodically edited Jefferson's primary document, shortening it by a fourth, removing unnecessary wording, and improving sentence structure.&lt;ref name="Ferling (2000), pp. 131–137"/&gt; They removed Jefferson's assertion that Great Britain had forced slavery on the colonies in order to moderate the document and appease persons in Great Britain who supported the Revolution.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Jefferson wrote that Congress had "mangled" his draft version, but the Declaration that was finally produced was "the majestic document that inspired both contemporaries and posterity," in the words of his biographer [[John Ferling]].&lt;ref name="Ferling (2000), pp. 131–137"&gt;[[John E. Ferling]], ''Setting the World Ablaze: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and the American Revolution'', Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-513409-4}}. {{OCLC|468591593}}, pp. 131–37&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress tabled the draft of the declaration on Monday, July 1, and resolved itself into a [[Committee of the Whole|committee of the whole]], with [[Benjamin Harrison V|Benjamin Harrison]] of Virginia presiding, and they resumed debate on Lee's resolution of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 181.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] made one last effort to delay the decision, arguing that Congress should not declare independence without first securing a foreign alliance and finalizing the [[Articles of Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 699.&lt;/ref&gt; John Adams gave a speech in reply to Dickinson, restating the case for an immediate declaration.

A vote was taken after a long day of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The delegation for each colony numbered from two to seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between [[Thomas McKean]] (who voted yes) and [[George Read (signer)|George Read]] (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations voted in favor of independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. [[Edward Rutledge]] of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 182; Jensen, ''Founding'', 700.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Declaration House Graff House.jpg|thumb|upright=0.90|"Declaration House", the boarding house at Market and S. 7th Street where Jefferson wrote the Declaration]]

On July 2, South Carolina reversed its position and voted for independence. In the Pennsylvania delegation, Dickinson and [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] abstained, allowing the delegation to vote three-to-two in favor of independence. The tie in the Delaware delegation was broken by the timely arrival of [[Caesar Rodney]], who voted for independence. The New York delegation abstained once again since they were still not authorized to vote for independence, although they were allowed to do so a week later by the [[New York Provincial Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution of independence had been adopted with twelve affirmative votes and one abstention. With this, the colonies had officially severed political ties with Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Evolution'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Adams predicted in a famous letter, written to his wife on the following day, that July 2 would become a great American holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, ''Founding'', 703–04.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the vote for independence would be commemorated; he did not foresee that Americans—including himself—would instead celebrate [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] on the date when the announcement of that act was finalized.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am apt to believe that [Independence Day] will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, as the Day of Deliverance by solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in {{cite book|last=Adams|first=John|title=My Dearest Friend: Letters of Abigail and John Adams|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTzX2ROPOCwC|year=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02606-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vTzX2ROPOCwC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=%22I+am+apt+to+believe%22 125]}}
Adams predicted that the celebration date would be July 2, the date the independence resolution was adopted, rather than July 4, the date the declaration was approved. Though he may have predicted the wrong celebration date, his thoughts were prophetic.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After voting in favor of the resolution of independence, Congress turned its attention to the committee's draft of the declaration. Over several days of debate, they made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text and, on July 4, 1776, the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved and sent to the printer for publication.

[[File:US-original-Declaration-1776.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|center|The opening of the original printing of the Declaration, printed on July 4, 1776, under Jefferson's supervision.

{{Clear}}
There is a distinct change in wording from this original broadside printing of the Declaration and the final official engrossed copy.  The word "unanimous" was inserted as a result of a Congressional resolution passed on July 19, 1776:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Resolved, That the Declaration passed on the 4th, be fairly engrossed on parchment, with the title and stile of "The unanimous declaration of the thirteen United States of America," and that the same, when engrossed, be signed by every member of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28jc00538%29%29: Journals of the Continental Congress – FRIDAY, JULY 19, 1776]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian George Billias says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Independence amounted to a new status of interdependence: the United States was now a sovereign nation entitled to the privileges and responsibilities that came with that status.  America thus became a member of the international community, which meant becoming a maker of treaties and alliances, a military ally in diplomacy, and a partner in foreign trade on a more equal basis.&lt;ref&gt;George Billias ''American Constitutionalism Heard Round the World, 1776-1989'' (2011) p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Annotated text of the engrossed declaration==
The declaration is not divided into formal sections; but it is often discussed as consisting of five parts: ''introduction'', ''preamble'', ''indictment'' of King George III, ''denunciation'' of the British people, and ''conclusion''.&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_style.html|title=The Stylistic Artistry of the Declaration of Independence|last=Lucas|first=Stephen E.|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

"He has refused his [[Royal assent|Assent to Laws]], the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

"He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

"He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

"He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

"He has [[Legislative session|dissolved]] Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness of his invasions on the rights of the people.

"He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

"He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the [[Plantation Act 1740|Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners]]; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

"He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.

"He has made [[Judicial independence|Judges dependent]] on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

"He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.

"He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

"He has affected to render the Military [[Civilian control of the military|independent of and superior to the Civil Power]].

"He has combined with others to subject us to a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|jurisdiction foreign to our constitution]], and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

"For [[Quartering Acts|quartering]] large bodies of armed troops among us:

"For protecting them, by a [[Kangaroo court|mock Trial]] from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

"For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

"For [[Townshend Acts|imposing Taxes]] on us [[No taxation without representation|without our Consent]]:

"For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of [[Jury trial|Trial by Jury]]:

"For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:

"For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a [[Quebec Act|neighbouring Province]], establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

"For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and [[Massachusetts Government Act|altering fundamentally]] the Forms of our Governments:

"For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

"He has abdicated Government here, by [[Proclamation of Rebellion|declaring]] us out of his Protection and [[Prohibitory Act|waging War]] against us.

"He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

"He is at this time transporting large Armies of [[Hessian (soldier)|foreign Mercenaries]] to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

"He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to [[Impressment|bear Arms against their Country]], to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

"He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

"In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a [[Tyrant]], is unfit to be the ruler of a free people."

==Influences and legal status==
[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|upright=.90|English political philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704)]]

Historians have often sought to identify the sources that most influenced the words and [[political philosophy]] of the Declaration of Independence. By Jefferson's own admission, the Declaration contained no original ideas, but was instead a statement of sentiments widely shared by supporters of the American Revolution. As he explained in 1825:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Neither aiming at originality of principle or sentiment, nor yet copied from any particular and previous writing, it was intended to be an expression of the American mind, and to give to that expression the proper tone and spirit called for by the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=808&amp;chapter=88496&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=TO HENRY LEE&amp;nbsp;– Thomas Jefferson The Works, vol. 12 (Correspondence and Papers 1816–1826; 1905) |date=May 8, 1825 |publisher=The Online Library of Liberty |accessdate=March 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jefferson's most immediate sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own draft of the preamble of the [[Constitution of Virginia]], and [[George Mason]]'s draft of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]]. Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, ''Jefferson the Virginian'', 221; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt; They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Declaration of Rights]], which formally ended the reign of [[James II of England|King James&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 126–28.&lt;/ref&gt; During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English Declaration of Rights as a model of how to end the reign of an unjust king.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 53–57.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish [[Declaration of Arbroath]] (1320) and the Dutch [[Act of Abjuration]] (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Maier found no evidence that the Dutch Act of Abjuration served as a model for the Declaration, and considers the argument "unpersuasive" (''American Scripture'', p. 264). Armitage discounts the influence of the Scottish and Dutch acts, and writes that neither was called "declarations of independence" until fairly recently (''Global History'', pp. 42–44). For the argument in favor of the influence of the Dutch act, see Stephen E. Lucas, "The 'Plakkaat van Verlatinge': A Neglected Model for the American Declaration of Independence", in Rosemarijn Hofte and Johanna C. Kardux, eds., ''Connecting Cultures: The Netherlands in Five Centuries of Transatlantic Exchange'' (Amsterdam, 1994), 189–207, and Barbara Wolff, "Was the Declaration of Independence Inspired by the Dutch?" University of Wisconsin Madison News, June 29, 1988, http://www.news.wisc.edu/3049 Accessed July 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson wrote that a number of authors exerted a general influence on the words of the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Evolution'', 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; English political theorist [[John Locke]] is usually cited as one of the primary influences, a man whom Jefferson called one of "the three greatest men that have ever lived".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Their works in the physical and moral sciences were instrumental in Jefferson's education and world view.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, historian [[Carl L. Becker]] wrote, "Most Americans had absorbed Locke's works as a kind of political gospel; and the Declaration, in its form, in its phraseology, follows closely certain sentences in Locke's [[Two Treatises of Government|second treatise on government]]."&lt;ref&gt;Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of Locke's influence on the American Revolution has been questioned by some subsequent scholars, however. Historian Ray Forrest Harvey argued in 1937 for the dominant influence of Swiss jurist [[Jean Jacques Burlamaqui]], declaring that Jefferson and Locke were at "two opposite poles" in their political philosophy, as evidenced by Jefferson's use in the Declaration of Independence of the phrase "pursuit of happiness" instead of "property".&lt;ref&gt;Ray Forrest Harvey, ''Jean Jacques Burlamaqui: A Liberal Tradition in American Constitutionalism'' (Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 1937), 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars emphasized the influence of [[republicanism]] rather than Locke's [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;A brief, online overview of the classical liberalism vs. republicanism debate is Alec Ewald, [http://www.flowofhistory.org/themes/american_republic/overview.php "The American Republic: 1760–1870" (2004)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517080053/http://www.flowofhistory.org/themes/american_republic/overview.php |date=May 17, 2008 }}.  In a similar vein, historian Robert Middlekauff argues that the political ideas of the independence movement took their origins mainly from the "eighteenth-century [[commonwealthmen]], the radical [[Radical Whigs|Whig]] ideology", which in turn drew on the political thought of [[John Milton]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], and [[John Locke]].  See [[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause'', pp. 3–6, 51–52, 136&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Garry Wills]] argued that Jefferson was influenced by the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], particularly [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], rather than Locke,&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Inventing America'', especially chs. 11–13. Wills concludes (p. 315) that "the air of enlightened America was full of Hutcheson's politics, not Locke's".&lt;/ref&gt; an interpretation that has been strongly criticized.&lt;ref&gt;Hamowy, "Jefferson and the Scottish Enlightenment", argues that Wills gets much wrong (p. 523), that the Declaration seems to be influenced by Hutcheson because Hutcheson was, like Jefferson, influenced by Locke (pp. 508–09), and that Jefferson often wrote of Locke's influence, but never mentioned Hutcheson in any of his writings (p. 514). See also Kenneth S. Lynn, "Falsifying Jefferson", ''Commentary'' 66 (Oct. 1978), 66–71. [[Ralph Luker]], in [http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1980/spring/luker-garry-wills/ "Garry Wills and the New Debate Over the Declaration of Independence"] (''The Virginia Quarterly Review'', Spring 1980, 244–61) agreed that Wills overstated Hutcheson's influence to provide a [[communitarian]] reading of the Declaration, but he also argued that Wills's critics similarly read their own views into the document.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal historian John Phillip Reid has written that the emphasis on the political philosophy of the Declaration has been misplaced. The Declaration is not a philosophical tract about natural rights, argues Reid, but is instead a legal document—an [[indictment]] against King George for violating the constitutional rights of the colonists.&lt;ref&gt;John Phillip Reid, "The Irrelevance of the Declaration", in Hendrik Hartog, ed., ''Law in the American Revolution and the Revolution in the Law'' (New York University Press, 1981), 46–89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]] has argued that the Declaration was strongly influenced by de Vattel's ''[[The Law of Nations]]'', the dominant [[international law]] treatise of the period, and a book that Benjamin Franklin said was "continually in the hands of the members of our Congress".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin to Charles F.W. Dumas, December 19, 1775, in ''The Writings of Benjamin Franklin'', ed. Albert Henry Smyth (New York: 1970), 6:432.&lt;/ref&gt; Armitage writes, "Vattel made independence fundamental to his definition of statehood"; therefore, the primary purpose of the Declaration was "to express the international legal sovereignty of the United States". If the United States were to have any hope of being recognized by the European powers, the American revolutionaries first had to make it clear that they were no longer dependent on Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 21, 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Declaration of Independence does not have the force of law domestically, but nevertheless it may help to provide historical and legal clarity about the Constitution and other laws.&lt;ref&gt;Gulf, C. &amp; SFR Co. v. Ellis, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4471514776465320556 165 US 150] (1897): "While such declaration of principles may not have the force of organic law, or be made the basis of judicial decision as to the limits of right and duty ... it is always safe to read the letter of the Constitution in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wills, Gary.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=V-XP_riSQU8C&amp;pg=PR25 Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence]'', p. 25 (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2002): "the Declaration is not a legal instrument, like the Constitution".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cuomo, Mario. ''Why Lincoln Matters: Now More Than Ever'', p. 137 (Harcourt Press 2004) (it "is not a law and therefore is not subjected to rigorous interpretation and enforcement").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strang, Lee [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2654408 "Originalism's Subject Matter: Why the Declaration of Independence Is Not Part of the Constitution"], ''[[Southern California Law Review]]'', Vol. 89, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signing==
{{Main|Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence}}
[[File:USA declaration independence.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The signed copy of the Declaration is now badly faded because of poor preserving practices in the 19th century. It is on display at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
[[File:Syng inkstand.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|The [[Syng inkstand]] was used at both the signing of the Declaration and the 1787 signing of the U.S. Constitution.]]
The Declaration became official when Congress voted for it on July 4; signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed it has long been the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, "Fourth of July Myths", 242–43.&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1796, signer [[Thomas McKean]] disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 299–302; Burnett, ''Continental Congress'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Declaration was transposed on paper, adopted by the Continental Congress, and signed by [[John Hancock]], President of the Congress, on July 4, 1776, according to the 1911 record of events by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] under Secretary [[Philander C. Knox]].&lt;ref name="U.S. State Department"&gt;The U.S. State Department (1911), ''The Declaration of Independence, 1776'', pp. 10, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 2, 1776, a parchment paper copy of the Declaration was signed by 56 persons.&lt;ref name="U.S. State Department"/&gt; Many of these signers were not present when the original Declaration was adopted on July 4.&lt;ref name="U.S. State Department"/&gt;  Signer [[Matthew Thornton]] from [[New Hampshire]] was seated in the Continental Congress in November; he asked for and received the privilege of adding his signature at that time, and signed on November 4, 1776.&lt;ref name="U.S. State Department"/&gt;

[[File:JohnHancocksSignature.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|On July 4, 1776, Continental Congress President [[John Hancock]]'s signature authenticated the United States Declaration of Independence.]]

Historians have generally accepted McKean's version of events, arguing that the famous signed version of the Declaration was created after July 19, and was not signed by Congress until August 2, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, "Fourth of July Myths", 245–46; Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 208–19; Wills, ''Inventing America'', 341.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, legal historian Wilfred Ritz argued that historians had misunderstood the primary documents and given too much credence to McKean, who had not been present in Congress on July 4.&lt;ref&gt;Ritz, "Authentication", 179–200.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ritz, about thirty-four delegates signed the Declaration on July 4, and the others signed on or after August 2.&lt;ref&gt;Ritz, "Authentication", 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians who reject a July 4 signing maintain that most delegates signed on August 2, and that those eventual signers who were not present added their names later.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 208–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two future U.S. presidents were among the signatories: Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. The most famous signature on the [[engrossed]] copy is that of [[John Hancock]], who presumably signed first as [[President of the Continental Congress|President of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazelton, ''Declaration History'', 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock's large, flamboyant signature became iconic, and the term ''John Hancock'' emerged in the United States as an informal synonym for "signature".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/John%20Hancock Merriam-Webster online]; [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/john%20hancock Dictionary.com].&lt;/ref&gt; A commonly circulated but apocryphal account claims that, after Hancock signed, the delegate from Massachusetts commented, "The British ministry can read that name without spectacles." Another apocryphal report indicates that Hancock proudly declared, "There! I guess King George will be able to read that!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachamericanhistory.org/File/John_Hancock.pdf|title=TeachAmericanHistory.org: John Hancock|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510132936/http://www.teachamericanhistory.org/File/John_Hancock.pdf|archive-date=May 10, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various legends emerged years later about the signing of the Declaration, when the document had become an important national symbol. In one famous story, John Hancock supposedly said that Congress, having signed the Declaration, must now "all hang together", and Benjamin Franklin replied: "Yes, we must indeed all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately." The quotation did not appear in print until more than fifty years after Franklin's death.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, ''Story of the Declaration'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Syng inkstand]] used at the signing was also used at the signing of the United States Constitution in 1787.

==Publication and reaction==

After Congress approved the final wording of the Declaration on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of [[John Dunlap]]. Through the night, Dunlap printed about 200 [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]] for distribution. Before long, it was being read to audiences and reprinted in newspapers throughout the 13 states. The first formal public readings of the document took place on July 8, in Philadelphia (by [[John Nixon (financier)|John Nixon]] in the yard of Independence Hall), [[Trenton, New Jersey]], and [[Easton, Pennsylvania]]; the first newspaper to publish it was the ''[[Pennsylvania Evening Post]]'' on July 6.&lt;ref name="Maier156"&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 156.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[German language|German]] translation of the Declaration was published in Philadelphia by July 9.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

President of Congress John Hancock sent a broadside to General [[George Washington]], instructing him to have it proclaimed "at the Head of the Army in the way you shall think it most proper".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington had the Declaration read to his troops in [[New York City]] on July 9, with thousands of British troops on ships in the harbor. Washington and Congress hoped that the Declaration would inspire the soldiers, and encourage others to join the army.&lt;ref name="Maier156"/&gt; After hearing the Declaration, crowds in many cities tore down and destroyed signs or statues representing royal authority. An equestrian statue of King George in New York City was pulled down and the lead used to make musket balls.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 156–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Whipple.jpg|thumb|upright|left=.90|[[William Whipple]], signer of the Declaration of Independence, freed his slave believing that he could not both fight for liberty and own a slave.]]

British officials in North America sent copies of the Declaration to Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 73.&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in British newspapers beginning in mid-August, it had reached Florence and Warsaw by mid-September, and a German translation appeared in Switzerland by October. The first copy of the Declaration sent to France got lost, and the second copy arrived only in November 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/courses/teachers_corner/34411.html|title=The Declaration of Independence in World Context|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached Portuguese America by Brazilian medical student "Vendek" José Joaquim Maia e Barbalho, who had met with Thomas Jefferson in Nîmes.

The Spanish-American authorities banned the circulation of the Declaration, but it was widely transmitted and translated: by Venezuelan Manuel García de Sena, by Colombian Miguel de Pombo, by Ecuadorian Vicente Rocafuerte, and by New Englanders Richard Cleveland and William Shaler, who distributed the Declaration and the United States Constitution among Creoles in Chile and Indians in Mexico in 1821.&lt;ref name="scholar.harvard.edu"&gt;[http://scholar.harvard.edu/armitage/files/sahj.pdf The Contagion of Sovereignty: Declarations of Independence since 1776]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[North Ministry]] did not give an official answer to the Declaration, but instead secretly commissioned pamphleteer [[John Lind (barrister)|John Lind]] to publish a response entitled ''Answer to the Declaration of the American Congress''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2QCAa27Zy4C&amp;pg=PA75|title=Armitage, ''Global History'', 75.|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Tories denounced the signers of the Declaration for not applying the same principles of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" to African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jessup |first=John J. |title=America and the Future |magazine=Life |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cVAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105 |page=105 |date=September 20, 1943 |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], the former royal governor of Massachusetts, also published a rebuttal.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 74.&lt;/ref&gt; These pamphlets challenged various aspects of the Declaration.

[[William Whipple]], a signer of the Declaration of Independence who had fought in the war, freed his slave [[Prince Whipple]] because of revolutionary ideals. In the postwar decades, other slaveholders also freed their slaves; from 1790 to 1810, the percentage of free blacks in the Upper South increased to 8.3 percent from less than one percent of the black population.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery, 1619–1877'' (1993), pp. 77–79, 81&lt;/ref&gt; All Northern states abolished slavery by 1804.

==History of the documents==
{{main|Physical history of the United States Declaration of Independence}}
The official copy of the Declaration of Independence was the one printed on July 4, 1776, under Jefferson's supervision. It was sent to the states and to the Army and was widely reprinted in newspapers. The slightly different "engrossed copy" (shown at the top of this article) was made later for members to sign. The engrossed version is the one widely distributed in the 21st century.  Note that the opening lines differ between the two versions.&lt;ref name="journals.psu.edu"/&gt;

The copy of the Declaration that was signed by Congress is known as the engrossed or [[parchment]] copy. It was probably engrossed (that is, carefully handwritten) by clerk [[Timothy Matlack]].&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_history.html |title=The Declaration of Independence: A History|work=Charters of Freedom |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A facsimile made in 1823 has become the basis of most modern reproductions rather than the original because of poor conservation of the engrossed copy through the 19th century.&lt;ref name=archives /&gt; In 1921, custody of the engrossed copy of the Declaration was transferred from the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] to the [[Library of Congress]], along with the [[United States Constitution]]. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the documents were moved for safekeeping to the [[United States Bullion Depository]] at [[Fort Knox]] in Kentucky, where they were kept until 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, ''Story of the Declaration'', 263.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the engrossed Declaration was transferred to the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] and is now on permanent display at the National Archives in the "Rotunda for the [[Charters of Freedom]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/press/press-kits/charters.html#pressrelaese1 |title=Charters of Freedom Re-encasement Project|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ArchivesRotunda.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|The Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom in the National Archives building]]

The document signed by Congress and enshrined in the National Archives is usually regarded as ''the'' Declaration of Independence, but historian [[Julian P. Boyd]] argued that the Declaration, like [[Magna Carta]], is not a single document. Boyd considered the printed broadsides ordered by Congress to be official texts, as well. The Declaration was first published as a broadside that was printed the night of July 4 by [[John Dunlap]] of Philadelphia. Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides, of which 26 are known to survive. The 26th copy was discovered in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] in England in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Rare copy of United States Declaration of Independence found in Kew |first= |last= |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5727812/Rare-copy-of-United-States-Declaration-of-Independence-found-in-Kew.html |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |date=July 3, 2009 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1777, Congress commissioned [[Mary Katherine Goddard]] to print [[:File:File-Goddard_broadside.jpg|a new broadside]] that listed the signers of the Declaration, unlike the Dunlap broadside.&lt;ref name=archives /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dube /&gt; Nine copies of the Goddard broadside are known to still exist.&lt;ref name=Dube&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/dube/inde2.htm |title=The Declaration of Independence |author=Ann Marie Dube |date=May 1996 |work=A Multitude of Amendments, Alterations and Additions: The Writing and Publicizing of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution of the United States |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of broadsides printed by the states are also extant.&lt;ref name=Dube /&gt;

Several early handwritten copies and drafts of the Declaration have also been preserved. Jefferson kept a four-page draft that late in life he called the "original Rough draught".&lt;ref name="Boyd, Lost Original, 446"&gt;Boyd, "Lost Original", 446.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how many drafts Jefferson wrote prior to this one, and how much of the text was contributed by other committee members. In 1947, Boyd discovered a fragment of an earlier draft in Jefferson's handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Papers of Jefferson'', 1:421.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson and Adams sent copies of the rough draft to friends, with slight variations.

During the writing process, Jefferson showed the rough draft to Adams and Franklin, and perhaps to other members of the drafting committee,&lt;ref name="Boyd, Lost Original, 446"/&gt; who made a few more changes. Franklin, for example, may have been responsible for changing Jefferson's original phrase "We hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable" to "We hold these truths to be self-evident".&lt;ref&gt;Becker, ''Declaration of Independence'', 142 note 1. Boyd (''Papers of Jefferson'', 1:427–28) casts doubt on Becker's belief that the change was made by Franklin.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson incorporated these changes into a copy that was submitted to Congress in the name of the committee.&lt;ref name="Boyd, Lost Original, 446"/&gt; The copy that was submitted to Congress on June 28 has been lost and was perhaps destroyed in the printing process,&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, "Lost Original", 448–50. Boyd argued that, if a document was signed on July 4 (which he thought unlikely), it would have been the Fair Copy, and probably would have been signed only by Hancock and Thomson.&lt;/ref&gt; or destroyed during the debates in accordance with [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Record of proceedings|Congress's secrecy rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritz, "From the ''Here''", speculates that the Fair Copy was immediately sent to the printer so that copies could be made for each member of Congress to consult during the debate. All of these copies were then destroyed, theorizes Ritz, to preserve secrecy.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2017, it was announced that a second engrossed copy had been discovered in the archives at [[West Sussex County Council]] in [[Chichester]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-sussex-44703928/declaration-of-independence-found-in-chichester-archives |title=Declaration of Independence document found |website=BBC News |author=|date= 4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Named by its finders the "Sussex Declaration", it differs from the National Archives copy (which the finders refer to as the "Matlack Declaration") in that the signatures on it are not grouped by States.  How it came to be in England is not yet known, but the finders believe that the randomness of the signatures points to an origin with signatory [[James Wilson]], who had argued strongly that the Declaration was made not by the States but by the whole people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/21/declaration-of-independence-sussex-england-rare|last=Yuhas|first=Alan|title=Rare parchment copy of US Declaration of Independence found in England|work=The Guardian|date=April 22, 2017|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://declaration.fas.harvard.edu/resources/sussex-dec|title=The Sussex Declaration|work=Declaration Resources Project|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Declaration was given little attention in the years immediately following the American Revolution, having served its original purpose in announcing the independence of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 87–88; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 162, 168–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Early celebrations of [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] largely ignored the Declaration, as did early histories of the Revolution. The ''act'' of declaring independence was considered important, whereas the ''text'' announcing that act attracted little attention.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 178–79; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration was rarely mentioned during the debates about the [[United States Constitution]], and its language was not incorporated into that document.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 92.&lt;/ref&gt; George Mason's draft of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] was more influential, and its language was echoed in state constitutions and state bills of rights more often than Jefferson's words.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 90; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 165–67.&lt;/ref&gt; "In none of these documents", wrote Pauline Maier, "is there any evidence whatsoever that the Declaration of Independence lived in men's minds as a classic statement of American political principles."&lt;ref name="Maier167"&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence in other countries===
Many leaders of the [[French Revolution]] admired the Declaration of Independence&lt;ref name="Maier167"/&gt; but were also interested in the new American state constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration and content of the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] (1789) emerged largely from the ideals of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Georges Lefebvre|title=The Coming of the French Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4EYuia7buUC&amp;pg=PA212|year=2005|publisher=Princeton UP|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its key drafts were prepared by [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]], working closely in Paris with his friend Thomas Jefferson.  It also borrowed language from [[George Mason]]'s [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Athan Billias, ed.|title=American Constitutionalism Heard Round the World, 1776–1989: A Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WV0nP5n_AoC&amp;pg=PA92|year=2009|publisher=NYU Press|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Dunn, ''Sister Revolutions: French Lightning, American Light'' (1999) pp. 143–45&lt;/ref&gt;  The declaration also influenced [[Russia in the American Revolutionary War#Russia and the Declaration of Independence|the Russian Empire]].  The document had a particular impact on the [[Decembrist revolt]] and other Russian thinkers.

According to historian [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]], the Declaration of Independence did prove to be internationally influential, but not as a statement of human rights. Armitage argued that the Declaration was the first in a new genre of [[Declaration of independence|declarations of independence]] that announced the creation of new states.

Other French leaders were directly influenced by the text of the Declaration of Independence itself. The ''Manifesto of the Province of Flanders'' (1790) was the first foreign derivation of the Declaration;&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 113.&lt;/ref&gt; others include the [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence]] (1811), the [[Liberian Declaration of Independence]] (1847), the declarations of secession by the [[Confederate States of America]] (1860–61), and the [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|Vietnamese Proclamation of Independence]] (1945).&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 120–35.&lt;/ref&gt; These declarations echoed the United States Declaration of Independence in announcing the independence of a new state, without necessarily endorsing the political philosophy of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, ''Global History'', 104, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries have used the Declaration as inspiration or have directly copied sections from it. These include the Haitian declaration of January 1, 1804, during the [[Haitian Revolution]], the [[United Provinces of New Granada]] in 1811, the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence]] in 1816, the [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]] in 1818, [[Costa Rica]] in 1821, [[El Salvador]] in 1821, [[Guatemala]] in 1821, [[Honduras]] in (1821), [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire|Mexico in 1821]], [[Nicaragua]] in 1821, [[Peru]] in 1821, [[Bolivian War of Independence]] in 1825, [[Uruguay]] in 1825, [[Ecuador]] in 1830, [[Colombia]] in 1831, [[Paraguay]] in 1842, [[Dominican Republic]] in 1844, [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] in March 1836, [[California Republic]] in November 1836, [[Hungarian Declaration of Independence]] in 1849, [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand]] in 1835, and the [[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]] from 1918 drafted in Washington D.C. with [[Gutzon Borglum]] among the drafters. The [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Rhodesian declaration of independence]], ratified in November 1965, is based on the American one as well; however, it omits the phrases "[[all men are created equal]]" and "[[Consent of the governed|the consent of the governed]]".&lt;ref name="scholar.harvard.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Revival of interest===
Interest in the Declaration was revived in the 1790s with the emergence of the United States's [[First Party System|first political parties]].&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1780s, few Americans knew or cared who wrote the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 172, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; But in the next decade, [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]] sought political advantage over their rival [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] by promoting both the importance of the Declaration and Jefferson as its author.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 179; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 168–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Federalists responded by casting doubt on Jefferson's authorship or originality, and by emphasizing that independence was declared by the whole Congress, with Jefferson as just one member of the drafting committee. Federalists insisted that Congress's act of declaring independence, in which Federalist John Adams had played a major role, was more important than the document announcing it.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, "Jefferson's Reputation", 180–84; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 171.&lt;/ref&gt; But this view faded away, like the Federalist Party itself, and, before long, the act of declaring independence became synonymous with the document.

A less partisan appreciation for the Declaration emerged in the years following the [[War of 1812]], thanks to a growing American nationalism and a renewed interest in the history of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Changing Reputation", 571–72; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 175–78.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1817, Congress commissioned [[John Trumbull]]'s [[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|famous painting]] of the signers, which was exhibited to large crowds before being installed in the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Changing Reputation", 572; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest commemorative printings of the Declaration also appeared at this time, offering many Americans their first view of the signed document.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Changing Reputation", 572; Maier, ''American Scripture'', 175–76; Wills, ''Inventing America'', 324. See also John C. Fitzpatrick, ''Spirit of the Revolution'' (Boston 1924).&lt;/ref&gt; Collective biographies of the signers were first published in the 1820s,&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 176.&lt;/ref&gt; giving birth to what Garry Wills called the "cult of the signers".&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Inventing America'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, many stories about the writing and signing of the document were published for the first time.

When interest in the Declaration was revived, the sections that were most important in 1776 were no longer relevant: the announcement of the independence of the United States and the grievances against King George. But the second paragraph was applicable long after the war had ended, with its talk of self-evident truths and unalienable rights.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, "Global History", 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] lacked sweeping statements about rights and equality, and advocates of groups with grievances turned to the Declaration for support.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1820s, variations of the Declaration were issued to proclaim the rights of workers, farmers, women, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 197. See also Philip S. Foner, ed., ''We, the Other People: Alternative Declarations of Independence by Labor Groups, Farmers, Woman's Rights Advocates, Socialists, and Blacks, 1829–1975'' (Urbana 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848, for example, the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] of women's rights advocates [[Declaration of Sentiments|declared]] that "all men and women are created equal".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 197; Armitage, ''Global History'', 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Trumbull's ''Declaration of Independence'' (1817–1826)===
{{main|Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)}}
[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|alt=About 50 men, most of them seated, are in a large meeting room. Most are focused on the five men standing in the center of the room. The tallest of the five is laying a document on a table.|[[John Trumbull]]'s [[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|famous painting]] is often identified as a depiction of the signing of the Declaration, but it actually shows the drafting committee presenting its work to the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Inventing America'', 348.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[John Trumbull]]'s painting ''Declaration of Independence'' has played a significant role in popular conceptions of the Declaration of Independence. The painting is {{convert|12|by|18|ft|adj=on}} in size and was commissioned by the [[United States Congress]] in 1817; it has hung in the [[United States Capitol Rotunda]] since 1826. It is sometimes described as the signing of the Declaration of Independence, but it actually shows the [[Committee of Five]] presenting their draft of the Declaration to the [[Second Continental Congress]] on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.&lt;ref&gt;John Hazelton, The Historical Value of Trumbull's – Declaration of Independence, [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA30&amp;id=tv47AAAAIAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography – Volume 31], (Historical Society of Pennsylvania, 1907), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trumbull painted the figures from life whenever possible, but some had died and images could not be located; hence, the painting does not include all the signers of the Declaration. One figure had participated in the drafting but did not sign the final document; another refused to sign. In fact, the membership of the Second Continental Congress changed as time passed, and the figures in the painting were never in the same room at the same time. It is, however, an accurate depiction of the room in [[Independence Hall]], the centerpiece of the [[Independence National Historical Park]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

Trumbull's painting has been depicted multiple times on U.S. currency and postage stamps. Its first use was on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] side of the $100 [[National Bank Note]] issued in 1863. A few years later, the [[steel engraving]] used in printing the bank notes was used to produce a 24-cent stamp, issued as part of the [[1869 Pictorial Issue]]. An engraving of the signing scene has been featured on the reverse side of the [[United States two-dollar bill]] since 1976.

===Slavery and the Declaration===
{{further |Slavery in the colonial United States}}
The apparent contradiction between the claim that "all men are created equal" and the existence of [[Slavery in the United States|American slavery]] attracted comment when the Declaration was first published. As mentioned above, Jefferson had included a paragraph in his initial draft that strongly indicted Great Britain's role in the slave trade, but this was deleted from the final version.&lt;ref name="MaierAmerican"&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 146–50.&lt;/ref&gt;   Jefferson himself was a prominent [[Virginia]] slave holder, having owned hundreds of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1969), ''Thomas Jefferson and the Problem of Slavery''&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to this seeming contradiction, English abolitionist [[Thomas Day]] wrote in a 1776 letter, "If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves."&lt;ref&gt;(1) [https://books.google.com/books?id=X2QCAa27Zy4C&amp;pg=PA77 Armitage, ''Global History'', 77.]&lt;br /&gt;(2) {{cite book|last=Day|first=Thomas|url=https://archive.org/stream/fragmentoforigin00dayt#page/10/mode/2up|title=Fragment of an original letter on the Slavery of the Negroes, written in the year 1776|work=London: Printed for John Stockdale (1784). Boston: Re-printed by [[William Lloyd Garrison|Garrison]] and Knapp, at the office of "[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]" (1831)|page=10|accessdate=February 26, 2014|quote=If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves.}}  At: [https://archive.org/ Internet Archive]: [https://archive.org/details/Johns_Hopkins_University The Johns Hopkins University Sheridan Libraries]: [https://archive.org/details/birney James Birney Collection of Antislavery Pamphlets].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the Declaration took on a special significance for the abolitionist movement. Historian [[Bertram Wyatt-Brown]] wrote that "abolitionists tended to interpret the Declaration of Independence as a theological as well as a political document".&lt;ref name=WB287&gt;Wyatt-Brown, ''Lewis Tappan'', 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Abolitionist leaders [[Benjamin Lundy]] and [[William Lloyd Garrison]] adopted the "twin rocks" of "the Bible and the Declaration of Independence" as the basis for their philosophies. "As long as there remains a single copy of the Declaration of Independence, or of the Bible, in our land," wrote Garrison, "we will not despair."&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, ''All on Fire'', 53, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; For radical abolitionists such as Garrison, the most important part of the Declaration was its assertion of the [[right of revolution]]. Garrison called for the destruction of the government under the Constitution, and the creation of a new state dedicated to the principles of the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 198–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial question of whether to add additional [[slave state]]s to the United States coincided with the growing stature of the Declaration. The first major public debate about slavery and the Declaration took place during the [[Missouri Compromise|Missouri controversy]] of 1819 to 1821.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Congressional Debate", 598.&lt;/ref&gt; Antislavery Congressmen argued that the language of the Declaration indicated that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] had been opposed to slavery in principle, and so new slave states should not be added to the country.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Congressional Debate", 604.&lt;/ref&gt; Proslavery Congressmen led by Senator [[Nathaniel Macon]] of North Carolina argued that the Declaration was not a part of the Constitution and therefore had no relevance to the question.&lt;ref&gt;Detweiler, "Congressional Debate", 605.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the antislavery movement gaining momentum, defenders of slavery such as [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]] and [[John C. Calhoun]] found it necessary to argue that the Declaration's assertion that "all men are created equal" was false, or at least that it did not apply to black people.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 199; Bailyn, ''Ideological Origins'', 246.&lt;/ref&gt; During the debate over the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] in 1853, for example, Senator [[John Pettit]] of Indiana argued that the statement "all men are created equal" was not a "self-evident truth" but a "self-evident lie".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, including [[Salmon P. Chase]] and [[Benjamin Wade]], defended the Declaration and what they saw as its antislavery principles.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 200–01.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lincoln and the Declaration===
[[File:Abelincoln1846.jpeg|thumb |upright=0.90|right|Congressman [[Abraham Lincoln]],&lt;br /&gt; 1845–1846]]
The Declaration's relationship to slavery was taken up in 1854 by [[Abraham Lincoln]], a little-known former Congressman who idolized the Founding Fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 201–02.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln thought that the Declaration of Independence expressed the highest principles of the American Revolution, and that the Founding Fathers had tolerated slavery with the expectation that it would ultimately wither away.&lt;ref name="McPherson126"/&gt; For the United States to legitimize the expansion of slavery in the Kansas-Nebraska Act, thought Lincoln, was to repudiate the principles of the Revolution. In his October 1854 [[Abraham Lincoln Peoria speech|Peoria speech]], Lincoln said:

{{quote|Nearly eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for some men to enslave others is a "sacred right of self-government".… Our republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust.…  Let us repurify it. Let us re-adopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it, the practices, and policy, which harmonize with it.… If we do this, we shall not only have saved the Union: but we shall have saved it, as to make, and keep it, forever worthy of the saving.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, ''Second American Revolution'', 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The meaning of the Declaration was a recurring topic in the [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858|famed debates]] between Lincoln and [[Stephen Douglas]] in 1858. Douglas argued that the phrase "all men are created equal" in the Declaration referred to white men only. The purpose of the Declaration, he said, had simply been to justify the independence of the United States, and not to proclaim the equality of any "inferior or degraded race".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln, however, thought that the language of the Declaration was deliberately universal, setting a high moral standard to which the American republic should aspire. "I had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement in the condition of all men everywhere," he said.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 204–05.&lt;/ref&gt; During the seventh and last joint debate with Steven Douglas at Alton, Illinois on October 15, 1858, Lincoln said about the declaration:

{{quote|I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all men, but they did not mean to declare all men equal in all respects. They did not mean to say all men were equal in color, size, intellect, moral development, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness in what they did consider all men created equal—equal in "certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." This they said, and this they meant. They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality, or yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact, they had no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit. They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all, constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even, though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people, of all colors, everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865): Political Debates Between Lincoln and Douglas 1897 |page=415 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/251/pages/page415.html |publisher=Bartleby |accessdate=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Pauline Maier, Douglas's interpretation was more historically accurate, but Lincoln's view ultimately prevailed. "In Lincoln's hands," wrote Maier, "the Declaration of Independence became first and foremost a living document" with "a set of goals to be realized over time".&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|quote=[T]here is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man.|source=—Abraham Lincoln, 1858&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 100.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Like [[Daniel Webster]], [[James Wilson]], and [[Joseph Story]] before him, Lincoln argued that the Declaration of Independence was a founding document of the United States, and that this had important implications for interpreting the Constitution, which had been ratified more than a decade after the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 129–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution did not use the word "equality", yet Lincoln believed that the concept that "all men are created equal" remained a part of the nation's founding principles.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 145.&lt;/ref&gt; He famously expressed this belief in the opening sentence of his 1863 [[Gettysburg Address]]: "Four score and seven years ago [i.e. in 1776] our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."

Lincoln's [[Declarationism|view of the Declaration]] became influential, seeing it as a moral guide to interpreting the Constitution. "For most people now," wrote Garry Wills in 1992, "the Declaration means what Lincoln told us it means, as a way of correcting the Constitution itself without overthrowing it."&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Admirers of Lincoln such as [[Harry V. Jaffa]] praised this development. Critics of Lincoln, notably [[Willmoore Kendall]] and [[Mel Bradford]], argued that Lincoln dangerously expanded the scope of the national government and violated [[states' rights]] by reading the Declaration into the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'', 39, 145–46. See also Harry V. Jaffa, ''Crisis of the House Divided'' (1959) and ''A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War'' (2000); Willmoore Kendall and George W. Carey, ''The Basic Symbols of the American Political Tradition'' (1970); and M.E. Bradford, "The Heresy of Equality: A Reply to Harry Jaffa" (1976), reprinted in ''A Better Guide than Reason'' (1979) and ''Modern Age, the First Twenty-five Years'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's suffrage and the Declaration===
[[File:ElizabethCadyStanton-1848-Daniel-Henry.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb |right |Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her two sons (1848).]]

In July 1848, the first woman's rights convention, the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], was held in [[Seneca Falls (hamlet), New York|Seneca Falls]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  The convention was organized by [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Lucretia Mott]], Mary Ann McClintock, and Jane Hunt. In their "[[Declaration of Sentiments]]", patterned on the Declaration of Independence, the convention members demanded social and political equality for women. Their motto was that "All men ''and women'' are created equal" and the convention demanded [[suffrage]] for women.  The suffrage movement was supported by [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Frederick Douglass]].&lt;ref&gt;Norton, et al (2010), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/senecafalls.html|title=Modern History Sourcebook: Seneca Falls: The Declaration of Sentiments, 1848|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century and later===
The Declaration was chosen to be the first digitized text (1971).&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|first=Alison| last=Flood |work=The Guardian |title=Michael Hart, inventor of the ebook, dies aged 64 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/08/michael-hart-inventor-ebook-dies |date=September 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence]] was dedicated in 1984 in [[Constitution Gardens]] on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where the signatures of all the original signers are carved in stone with their names, places of residence, and occupations.

The new [[One World Trade Center]] building in [[New York City]] (2014) is 1776 feet high to symbolize the year that the Declaration of Independence was signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/10/us/new-york-world-trade-center-spire/index.html?hpt=hp_abar_wknd |title=Crews finish installing World Trade Center spire |publisher=CNN |date=May 10, 2013 |accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?cityID=8 |title=Tallest buildings in NY |publisher=Skyscraperpage.com |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?25002165 |title=Tallest buildings under construction in the world |publisher=Skyscraperpage.com |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===
The adoption of the Declaration of Independence was dramatized in the 1969 Tony Award–winning musical ''[[1776 (musical)|1776]]'' and the [[1776 (film)|1972 film version]], as well as in the 2008 television miniseries ''[[John Adams (miniseries)|John Adams]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1776themusical.us/about-us/|title=1776: The Musical About Us|publisher=Pratico|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hbo.com/john-adams/episodes/2-independence/synopsis|title=John Adams: Independence|publisher=Home Box Office, Inc.|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, [[The 5th Dimension]] recorded the opening of the Declaration on their album ''[[Portrait (The 5th Dimension album)|Portrait]]'' in the song "Declaration". It was first performed on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on December 7, 1969, and it was taken as a song of protest against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Independence| author=&lt;!--Editorial staff; no by-line.--&gt;| date=July 4, 2010| access-date=February 10, 2018| newspaper=[[Fort Wayne Journal Gazette]]| url=http://www.ufppc.org/us-a-world-news-mainmenu-35/9786-song-when-the-fifth-dimension-sang-the-declaration-of-independence.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration of Independence is also a plot device in the 2004 American film ''[[National Treasure (film)|National Treasure]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/national_treasure/| title=National Treasure| website=rottentomatoes.com| year=2004| accessdate=June 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vaikuṇṭha, according to Hindu vedas is ’ek hazar Brahman [universe]’ above brahmalok or  [[Satyaloka]].&lt;ref&gt; And on top of vaikuntha according to Hindu Vedas is akshardama the form of Aksharbrahma the divine abode of Bhagwan Purna Purushottam [[Swaminarayan]]

&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the extant [[Purana]]s and [[Vaishnava]] traditions, Vaikuntha is located in the direction of the ''Makara Rashi'' which coincides with the constellation of [[Capricornus|Capricorn]].

===Bhagavata Purana===
{{quote| In the Bhagavata, the text speaks of Vaikuntha, adorable to all the worlds (X.12.26), as the highest realm where Vishnu resides (XII.24.14). This, too, is the highest region (IV.12.26); beyond the world of darkness and samsāra (the cycle of birth and death) (IV.24.29; X.88.25); the destination of those who have transcended the three gunas even while they are still alive (XI.25.22); and beyond which there is no higher place (II.2.18, II.9.9). The peaceful ascetics who reach that place never return (IV.9.29; X.88.25-6). The residents of Vaikuntha do not have material bodies, but have pure forms (VII.1.34). These forms are like that of Vishnu (III.15.14ff.), also known as Narayana. Vishnu/Narayana resides in Vaikuntha with Sri, the goddess of fortune, in palaces with crystal walls. The parks there shine like final liberation itself, and contain wish-fulfilling trees, which blossom all the year round. There are fragrant winds, and creepers dripping with honey near bodies of water. Cries of exotic birds mingle with the humming of bees, and magnificent flowers bloom everywhere. Devotees of Vishnu along with their beautiful wives travel in aerial vehicles made of jewels, emeralds and gold, but the beautiful smiling residents of this realm cannot distract the minds of the opposite sex, since everyone is absorbed in Krishna (III.15.14-25).&lt;ref&gt;Krishna: The Beautiful Legend of God: Srimad Bhagavata Purana|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=y8Bb0tRW7W4C&amp;pg=PT38&amp;dq=krishna+vaikuntha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUzoma-JjUAhUKM48KHUsCChY4FBDoAQgfMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=krishna%20vaikuntha&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15926">[[image:Williamapes.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Autobiography of William Apess]]
'''William Apess''' (1798–1839, [[Pequot people|Pequot]]) (also known as '''William Apes''' before 1837), was an ordained [[Methodist]] minister, writer, and activist of [[mixed-race]] descent, who was a political and religious leader in Massachusetts. After becoming ordained as a Methodist minister in 1829, he published his autobiography the same year. It is among the first autobiographies by a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] writer. Apess was part [[Pequot]] by descent, especially through his mother's family, and identified with their culture.

In 1833, while serving as an itinerant preacher in New England, Apess visited the [[Mashpee people|Mashpee]] on Cape Cod. Hearing their grievances against white overseers and settlers who stole their wood, he helped organize what was called the [[Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe#History|Mashpee Revolt]] of 1833-34. Their attempt to regain civil rights was covered sympathetically by the ''Boston Advocate,'' but criticized by local journals on Cape Cod. Apess published a book about the experience in 1835, which he summarized as "Indian Nullification."

Apess alienated many of his supporters before dying in New York City at age 41, but he has been described as "perhaps the most successful activist on behalf of Native American rights in the antebellum United States."&lt;ref name="Bizzell"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qQh0iWHNk5IC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%28Native%29+American+Jeremiad:+The+%27Mixedblood%27+Rhetoric+of+William+Apess&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%28Native%29%20American%20Jeremiad%3A%20The%20%27Mixedblood%27%20Rhetoric%20of%20William%20Apess&amp;f=false Bizzell, Patricia.

==Early life==
William Apess was born in 1798 in [[Colrain, Massachusetts|Colrain]] in northwestern Massachusetts to William and Candace Apess of the [[Pequot]] tribe. According to his autobiography, his father was mixed Pequot and European American, as Apess' white paternal grandfather had married a Pequot woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Son_of_the_Forest_and_Other_Writings.html?id=PJRi-6maIyAC Barry O'Connell, ed., ''A Son of the Forest and Other Writings''], University of Massachusetts, 1997, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hpCJ5Z3yc9MC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false O'Connell, Barry, ed. ''On Our Own Ground: The Complete Writings of William Apess, a Pequot''], N.P.: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1992, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed descent from [[Metacomet|King Philip]] through his mother, who also had some European-American and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African-American]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell, Barry, ''American National Biography'', Vol. 1. New York: Oxford University, 1999, p. 555&lt;/ref&gt; Until the age of five, Apess lived with his family, including two brothers and two sisters, near Colrain.&lt;ref name="Reuben"&gt;Reuben, Paul P. [http://www.csustan.edu/english/reuben/pal/chap3/apess.html "Chapter 3: William Apes or William Apess (Pequot) (1798-1839)"], ''Perspectives in American Literature.'' 24 Dec 2010 (retrieved 13 Sept 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

His parents separated, and the five children were cared for by their maternal grandparents. But they were abusive and suffered from [[alcoholism]]. After seeing continued abuse, a neighbor intervened with the town selectmen on behalf of the children. They were taken away for their own safety and [[indentured]] to European-American families. Then five-year-old Apess was cared for by his neighbor, Mr. Furman, for a year until he had recovered from injuries sustained while living with his grandparents. His autobiography does not mention any contact with his Pequot relatives for the rest of his childhood. He said that he did not see his mother for twenty years after the beating. In contrast, he grew to love his adopted family dearly, despite his status as an indentured servant. When Mrs. Furman's mother died, he writes that "She had always been so kind to me that I missed her quite as much as her children, and I had been allowed to call her mother."&lt;ref&gt;William Apess, ''A Son of the Forest,'' 1829&lt;/ref&gt; Apess was sent to school during the winter for six years to gain an education, while also assisting Furman at work.&lt;ref name="Reuben"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry O'Connell, ed., ''A Son of the Forest and Other Writings'', University of Massachusetts, 1997, pp. 5-7&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Furman, a [[Baptist]], gave William his first memorable experience with Christianity when he was six, and she discussed with him the importance of going to heaven or hell. Even as a young child, his devotion was ardent. He describes the joy he gained from sermons, and the depression he suffered when Mr. Furman eventually forbade him from attending.&lt;ref&gt;William Apess, ''A Son of the Forest,'' pp. 28, 1829&lt;/ref&gt;

At William was eleven, Mr. Furman discovered his ill-formed plans to run away. He never really wanted to leave, but, despite his reassurances, the family he had come to regard as his own sold his indenture to Judge James Hillhouse, a member of the Connecticut elite. The elderly judge, too old to deal with an unruly and rejected child, quickly sold his indenture to Gen. William Williams, under whom Apess spent four years. During this period, Apess grew increasingly close to the "noisy [[Methodist Church|Methodists]]."&lt;ref&gt;William Apess, ''A Son of the Forest,'' pp. 39&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|reason=Given source does not discuss the demographics of the noisy Methodists.|date=February 2016}} The congregation he knew had many people of mixed race, including African Americans and Native Americans. The Methodists were more welcoming than the Congregational Church, to which the town elite belonged.

Apess ran away from General Williams at the age of fifteen and joined a [[militia]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], where he fought in the [[War of 1812]]. By the age of 16, he became an [[alcoholic]] and struggled with alcoholism for the rest of his life. From the years 1816 to 1818, he worked at various jobs in [[Canada]].

Troubled by his alcoholism, Apess decided to return home to the [[Pequot]] and his family in Massachusetts. Within a short period of time, he reclaimed his Pequot identity. He attended meetings of local [[Methodist]] groups and was baptized in December 1818.

==Personal life==
In 1821, Apess married Mary Wood, also of mixed race. The couple had one son and three daughters together.&lt;ref name="Reuben"/&gt; After Mary died, Apess later remarried. He and his second wife settled in New York City in the late 1830s.

==Career==
After his marriage, Apess felt his vocation was to preach. In 1829 he was ordained as a Protestant Methodist minister, a group he found less hierarchical and rule bound than the Methodist Episcopal Church.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell (1997), ''A Son of the Forest'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he published his autobiography, ''A Son of the Forest: The Experience of William Apess, A Native of the Forest, Comprising a Notice of the Pequot Tribe of Indians, Written by Himself.'' Apess' work was one of the first autobiographies published by a Native American and was published partly in reaction to advocates of [[Indian Removal]], including President [[Andrew Jackson]]. They wanted to remove Native Americans to west of the Mississippi River, especially those who were numerous in the Southeast. Apess based his narrative on his spiritual conversion, a common genre of the time, and commented also on European-American prejudices against Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell (1997), ''A Son of the Forest'', pp. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

As was the Methodist practice of the day, Apess became an itinerant preacher; he preached in meetings throughout [[New England]] to mixed congregations including Native American, European-American, and African-American audiences. In 1833, following a visit to the town of [[Mashpee, Massachusetts|Mashpee]], the largest Native American town in [[Massachusetts]], Apess became convinced the State was acting illegally in denying self-government to the Mashpee Wampanoag.

The Mashpee Wampanoag had a close culture and wooded land at the elbow of Cape Cod. Their limited autonomy had been reduced when the reservation was placed under supervision by a board of white overseers. These men allowed white settlers to take the Mashpee wood and permitted other incursions on their land. The Mashpee wanted to protect their grounds. Apess spoke out on their behalf at local meetings. He also participated in the so-called Mashpee Revolt of 1833-34, in which the Mashpee took action to restore their self-government. They wrote to the state government announcing their intention to rule themselves, according to their constitutional rights, and to prevent whites from taking away their wood (a recurring problem). In May 1833, the Mashpee tribe wrote to [[Harvard College]], which administered the Williams Fund that paid for a minister to them.&lt;ref name="oconnell"/&gt;

The tribe had never been consulted in such appointment and objected to Rev. Mr. Fish, who had long been appointed to them. They did not like his preaching, and said that he had enriched himself by appropriating hundreds of acres of woodland at the tribe's expense.&lt;ref name="oconnell"&gt;O'Connell (1992), "Indian Nullification," in ''On Our Own Ground'', pp. 175-179&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, they prevented a settler, William Sampson, from taking wood away from their property and unloaded his wagon. Three Indians were indicted for riot and Apess was jailed for a month as a result.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell (1992), "Indian Nullification," in ''On Our Own Ground'', p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; An attorney assisted them in successfully appealing to the legislature, but initially Governor [[Levi Lincoln, Jr.]] threatened the group with military force.

The issues were reported sympathetically by Harnett of the ''Boston Advocate'' through June and July.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell (1992), "Indian Nullification," in ''On Our Own Ground'', pp. 200-201&lt;/ref&gt; The Mashpee protest followed the [[Nullification Crisis of 1832]] on the national level, in which Southern states proposed they could nullify federal law. The historian Barry O'Connell suggests that Apess intended to highlight the Mashpee attempt to nullify Massachusetts laws discriminating against Native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell (1992), "Indian Nullification," in ''On Our Own Ground'', p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Apess continually drew parallels between the desire of [[free people of color]] for their rights, particularly Native Americans, and the historic struggle of European-American colonists for independence. He drew from the history of relations between Native Americans and the colonists, as well as relations within the United States.

During the period 1831-1836, Apess published several of his sermons and public lectures, and became known as a powerful speaker. But, struggling with alcoholism and increasing resentment of white treatment of Natives, he gradually lost the respect in which he had been held; both white and Mashpee groups distanced themselves from him.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In 1836, he gave a public lecture in the form of a memorial eulogy for [[Metacomet|King Philip]], a seventeenth-century Indian leader who was assassinated by the Plymouth colonists. Apess extolled him as a leader equal to any among the European Americans. He had been killed after the colonists had poisoned his brother and violated several treaties.

After publishing his lecture, Apess disappeared from New England public life.  He moved to New York City with his second wife and children, trying to find work. The recession of 1837 was broadly damaging and especially affected the lower and working classes, so he struggled in New York.

==Death==
At the age of 41, William Apess died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] (stroke) on April 10, 1839 at 31 Washington Street in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Konkle, Maureen. ''Writing Indian Nations: Native Intellectuals and the Politics of Historiography, 1827-1863'', Chapel Hill: U of North Carolina Press, 2004, p. 106 passim&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Youth for Human Rights International organized a conference at a Los Angeles High School. Stephen Strachan, principal of Jordan High School, said that although he knew some of the organizers were Scientologists, he did not know of YHRI's relationship to the church until the Church of Scientology was listed on publicity materials as a co-sponsor. After learning of the connection, an agreement was negotiated to remove any mention of the Church of Scientology from literature, and letters were sent to parents saying students would need permission to attend the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Joel | last = Rubin | title = District Scrambles to Ensure Human Rights Event Is Religion-Free | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/01/local/me-jordan1 | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 2005-10-01 | accessdate = 2008-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Scientology group sponsors school event | url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9663283_ITM | date = 2005-10-01 | publisher = UPI Newstrack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, YHRI led a pilot human rights course in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, at which it distributed L. Ron Hubbard's tract "The Way to Happiness" to students ranging from 12 to 17 years old, and taught them Scientology jargon like the [[Emotional tone scale|tone scale]], while trying to enroll them in [[Drug Free Marshalls]], a Scientology organization like [[Narconon]]. An official in the provincial government said he hoped to bring it to the province's 4.44 million children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Ndebele flirts with Scientology | url = http://www.mg.co.za/articledirect.aspx?articleid=310747 | date = 2007-06-10 | publisher = Mail &amp; Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2007, at a human rights youth forum organized by YHRI, in [[Sydney, Australia]], three students from Canterbury Girls High School expressed concern at overt references to Scientology in the promotional materials. One said she felt "exploited."  The Department of Education is looking into the students' complaints. However, [[David Clarke (Australian politician)|David Clarke]], a [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] of the [[New South Wales]] [[Legislative Council of New South Wales|upper house]] and a member of the Catholic group [[Opus Dei]], said that he had also been unaware of any strong links between the youth forum and the Church of Scientology. But, Clarke added, "I'm a practising Catholic. There was no pushing as far as I could see of Scientology."&lt;ref name="sydney"&gt;{{cite web |  url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/unwitting-highschoolers-lured-to-forum-run-by-scientologists/2007/03/27/1174761471748.html | title = Unwitting highschoolers lured to forum by Scientologists| publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 2007-03-27 | accessdate = 2007-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German journalist has accused Scientology of [[false advertising]] through YHRI, recruiting members indirectly, and government officials in Germany have said YHRI serves as a cover-up tactic for Scientology.&lt;ref name="weltcaberta"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article707504/Form_des_politischen_Extremismus.html | title =A form of political extremism | accessdate = 2007-04-17 | author = Thomas Klatt | date = 2007-01-09 | publisher = [[Die Welt]]|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="faz.net"/&gt;

The Florida Holocaust Museum complained that YHRI's connection to Scientology was not disclosed when they worked with them to organize at a human rights march in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sptimes.com/2007/04/07/Southpinellas/Tie_to_rights_march_w.shtml | title = Tie to rights march wasn't revealed | accessdate = 2007-04-14 | author = Meg Laughlin |author2=Rob Farley  | date = 2007-04-07 | publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In each of the above cases the YHRI organizer responded that, while the Church of Scientology supported their group, it was a YHRI event, not a Church event and the message was human rights, not Scientology.  However, the Herald reported that, on the materials handed out at the event in Australia, L.Ron Hubbard's image and quotes figured more prominently than those of such activists as Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref name="sydney"/&gt;

[[Ursula Caberta]], the Commissioner for the [[Scientology Task Force of the Hamburg Interior Authority]], a Scientology watchdog group, stated the YHRI is one of a number of Scientology-linked groups that mask their connection to the church and seek to attract and recruit the young.&lt;ref name="weltcaberta"/&gt;

In 1995, the [[Senate of Hamburg|Hamburg Senate]] released a report on Scientology, describing its structure and the dangers it presented to individuals and society.  One passage, citing Scientology documents, clarified the role of all organizations, which, like YHRI, are linked to the church.

"In an internal memo, Scientology described the function of affiliate organizations:

'All organizations and groups form a global network.  Each one has its own individual role and responsibilities.  But all service organizations have the goal to draw attention to L.Ron Hubbard's technology and deliver it to the public.'

Thus, each activity, however distantly it is related to Scientology, fits into a long-term strategic plan, which is ultimately steered by the highest management." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fhh.hamburg.de/stadt/Aktuell/behoerden/inneres/arbeitsgruppe-scientology/publikationen/senatsmitteilung-1995-09-26-pdf,property=source.pdf |format=PDF| title = Senate report to the citizenry: Scientology | date = 1995-09-26 | publisher = The Free Hanseatic City of Hamburg| accessdate = 2007-05-18 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the official Scientology website, YHRI is part of its overall campaign.&lt;ref name="coshrws"&gt;CoS Human Rights web site: Actions for Human Rights in Washington, D.C. http://www.scientology.org/humanrights/photo/washington-dc/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; YHRI, known in German as "Jugend für Menschenrechte," is active in both Switzerland and Germany, organizing human rights conferences for youth to promote religious tolerance.&lt;ref name="hugostamm"&gt;{{cite web | first = Hugo | last = Stamm | title = Scientologists tempt the young | url = http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/dyn/news/zuerich/600104.html | publisher = Tages Anzeiger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the campaign, [[Antje Blumenthal]], a member of the German parliament, expressed concern that the good intentions of the young were being misused.&lt;ref name="hugostamm" /&gt;
