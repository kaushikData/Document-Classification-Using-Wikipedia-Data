Each year it is co-hosted by a different member institution in a different region of the world. AFI has more than 100 member institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi-global.org/afi-network/members |title=AFI Member Institutions |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822075823/http://www.afi-global.org/afi-network/members |archivedate=2012-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from more than 89 nations making the GPF the most important and comprehensive forum for regulatory institutions with an interest in promoting [[financial inclusion]] policy. The Forum is focused on developing and improving national financial inclusion strategies and policies, and is used as a platform for senior financial regulators to exchange ideas as well as engage in peer-to-peer learning activities.

For example, at the 6th Annual Microfinance Conference and Entrepreneurship Awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2011/pressrelease/gvd/Online%20Advert%20%20Registration%20for%206th%20AMFEA%20(2).pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127044625/http://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2011/pressrelease/gvd/Online%20Advert%20%20Registration%20for%206th%20AMFEA%20%282%29.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Central Bank of Nigeria|Central Bank of Nigeria's]] (CBN) Governor [[Sanusi Lamido Sanusi]], spoke of his institution's progress, noting the CBN had "...made a commitment at the GPF&lt;ref name="afi-global.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi-global.org/global-policy-forum/gpf-2011-riviera-maya|title=GPF 2011 - Mexico|work=AFI Global - Bringing smart policies to life}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2011 held in Mexico to reduce Nigeria's financial exclusion rate from 46.3 to 20 per cent by 2020."

During last year's Forum in Mexico the AFI membership adopted the Maya Declaration, the first global and measurable set of commitments by developing and emerging countries to unlock the economic and social potential of the 2.5 billion poorest people through greater financial inclusion. The GPF 2012 highlighted the progress of the 24 AFI member institutions that followed through with concrete commitments to the Maya Declaration over the course of the previous year. Additionally, on the final morning of the three-day Forum in Cape Town, 19 institutions announced new Maya Declaration Commitments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.afi-global.org//news/2012/9/28/nineteen-new-maya-declaration-commitments-made-global-policy-forum-2012# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013060153/http://www.afi-global.org/news/2012/9/28/nineteen-new-maya-declaration-commitments-made-global-policy-forum-2012# |archive-date=2012-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase the number of institutional financial inclusion commitments to 35 overall — an impressive achievement that marked the one year anniversary of the Declaration's inception.

The institutions making commitments ranged from those representing large diverse populations such as Mexico and Peru, to smaller nations such as Fiji and the Solomon Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1110/S00335/solomon-islands-shares-experience-on-financial-inclusion.htm |title=Solomon Islands shares experience on financial inclusion &amp;#124; Scoop News |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date=2011-10-12 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 300 participants from 80 financial regulatory institutions took part in 2011 GPF, along with representatives from the [[World Bank]], the [[United Nations]], the [[Gates Foundation]] and other international organizations.

In his closing remarks, Mexico's President [[Felipe Calderón Hinojosa]] stated "...it is so important that we are all gathered here today, public officials, central bank presidents, ministers, secretaries, academics, specialists of over 70 countries, to reflect on the developments and challenges of financial inclusion. It is a key task, since, by opening the doors of credit, savings and insurance to more persons, we are  giving more certainty to the present and we are broadening their capacity to build a better future. Financial inclusion is a means to reach greater social justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpfi.org/sites/default/files/Closing%20Remarks%20-%20AFI%20Global%20Policy%20Forum,%20Mexico.pdf |title=Closing Remarks - AFI Global Policy Forum, Mexico, 2011 |author=Mr. [[Felipe Calderón Hinojosa]], [[President of the United Mexican States]] |publisher=The Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same ceremony, the United Nations Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance, [[Princess Maxima]] of the Netherlands, highlighted that she was inspired to see that GPF participants were at the forefront of innovations in policy, regulation, and supervision, and had now an opportunity to lead developed country banking sectors in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

AFI’s work helps to get financial inclusion high on the agenda in a way that it has not been before."&lt;ref&gt;[http://centerforfinancialinclusionblog.wordpress.com/2010/10/06/‘what-afi-is-doing-is-unprecedented’-—-beth-rhyne-on-the-global-policy-forum/ ‘What AFI is doing is unprecedented’ — Beth Rhyne on the Global Policy Forum « Center for Financial Inclusion Blog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aaron Gitonga Ringera''', E.B.S. is a [[Kenyan]] [[lawyer]] who served as a judge and as the former director of the [[Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission]] (KACC). He was born in Githongo, Meru, on June 20, 1950.

== Education and early career ==

Ringera has a Master's (LLM) and Bachelor's (LLB) degrees in law from the [[University of Nairobi]]. He also holds a diploma in international and comparative law of human rights from [[Strasbourg]] in [[France]] and studied for a diploma in law and practice at the [[Kenya School of Law]]. He worked as a lecturer at the University of Nairobi. He also doubled up as a lawyer in private practice together with [[Kiraitu Murungi]] and [[Gibson Kamau Kuria]], but when the latter two fell in trouble with the authorities during the "dark era" of Moi, he quit the firm he helped found and instead teamed up with [[George Oraro]] and [[Ambrose Rachier]].

== Public service career ==

He was a senior lecturer in the University of Nairobi and taught most of the leading lawyers and was chairman of the Department of Public Law.

He was later appointed judge of the high court in 1994, marking the end of his career as a top lawyer and transitioning to the bench. In 1999, President [[Daniel arap Moi]] elevated him by appointing him to the position of solicitor-general, succeeding Benjamin Kubo, who retired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kacc.go.ke Kenya Anti Corruption Commission Website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901161859/http://www.kacc.go.ke/ |date=September 1, 2009 }} (Main Page as of October 10, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the director of [[Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority]] (KACA) in March 1999, succeeding the first director [[John Harun Mwau]]. The high court ruled on December 22, 2000, that KACA was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.kacc.go.ke/default.asp?pageid=2 Kenya Anti Corruption Commission Website: History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091102144651/http://www.kacc.go.ke/default.asp?pageid=2 |date=November 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the head of Civil Service [[Richard Leakey]] asked Ringera to resign, which he did in January 2001.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, January 29, 2009: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1142706.stm Kenyan anti-corruption director resigns]&lt;/ref&gt; KACA was succeeded by the Kenya Anti Corruption Commission, which was established in 2003.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Ringera was appointed as the first director of KACC in August 2004, despite opposition from the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Kenya)|Liberal Democratic Party]], which was part of the [[National Rainbow Coalition|NARC]] coalition government. As a result of this appointment, he retired as a judge in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, August 4, 2004: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3536284.stm Kenya's anti-corruption go-ahead]&lt;/ref&gt; The director of KACC had the highest salary for a civil servant in Kenya, and enjoyed a better salary than the president.&lt;ref name="resigns"&gt;BBC News, September 30, 2009: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8283103.stm Kenyan corruption chief resigns]&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2009 book ''[[Our Turn To Eat]]'', journalist [[Michela Wrong]] accused Ringera of delivering death threats against his then-colleague [[John Githongo]] in November 2005 and February 2006.  In 2009, the [[United States Government]] sought to deny Ringera an entry [[visa (document)|visa]] for his alleged role in hampering anti-corruption investigations while head of the KACC.&lt;ref&gt;https://wikileaks.org/cable/2009/09/09NAIROBI1938.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Ringera was reappointed by President [[Mwai Kibaki]] for a second five-year term on August 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Nation, August 31, 2009: [http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/650602/-/umptsx/-/index.html Ringera reappointed anti-graft director]&lt;/ref&gt; However, two weeks later the Kenyan parliament voted against the appointment, stating it was not legal as it should have been approved by the parliament&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, September 17, 2009: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8260385.stm Kenya corruption fighter rejected]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time in Kenyan history, when the parliament overruled the president. As a result, Ringera resigned on September 30, 2009. He was replaced by prominent Kenyan Lawyer, P.L.O Lumumba as the Commission's Director.&lt;ref name="resigns"/&gt; Ringera has answered his critics by stating that he did not have powers to prosecute those accused of corruption and resigned to save the KACC from the threat of dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, September 1, 2009: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8231252.stm Kenyan anger over corruption job]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/-/539546/666072/-/view/printVersion/-/m9icu7/-/index.html|title=Ringera quits  to save Kacc from threat of dissolution|work=Business Daily|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ringera is currently serving as a judge of the Appellate Division of the East African Court Of Justice in Arusha Tanzania, having being appointed alongside two other judges by President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2014, replacing retiring Judge Justice Philip Tunoi. He is also a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators of London. [http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Aaron-Ringera-Philip-Tunoi-East-African-Court-of-Justice/-/1056/2299334/-/61uxaj/-/index.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3689">'''Al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar bin Yahya''' (June 1217 &amp;ndash; June 23, 1298) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]] whose imamate lasted from 1276 to 1298.

==Internal Zaidi rivalries==
When the old imam [[al-Mahdi Ibrahim]] was defeated and captured by the [[Rasulid]] sultan, the Zaidi elite of the northern Yemeni highland asked the ex-imam [[al-Hasan bin Wahhas]] to succeed. When al-Hasan refused, the offer went to al-Mutahhar bin Yahya bin al-Murtada, a descendant of the imam [[An-Nasir Ahmad (Zaidi imam)|an-Nasir Ahmad]] (d. 934).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.almajalis.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;26t=2632 (in Arabic); http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&amp;page_num=46 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726201117/http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&amp;page_num=46 |date=2011-07-26 }} (in Arabic). The line of descent is an-Nasir Ahmad - Ali - Muhammad - al-Mutahhar - al-Mutahhar - al-Qasim - al-Mutahhar - al-Murtada - Yahya - al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar bin Yahya.&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted and took the honorific name al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar.&lt;ref&gt;El-Khazreji, ''The Pearl-Strings; A History of the Resuli Dynasty'', Vol. I. Leiden 1906, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; The strongest political figure in the Zaidi lands was, however, the [[emir]] Sarim ad-Din Da'ud, son of a former imam, who was the leader of the Hamzite Sharifs. In 1284, Sarim ad-Din tried to induce al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar and al-Hasan bin Wahhas to enter hostilities with the [[Rasulid Dynasty]], but they mistrusted him and refused. Sarim ad-Din then made an abortive attempt to set up a close relative, Ahmad bin Ibrahim, as imam.&lt;ref&gt;El-Khazreji, 1906, pp. 208-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warfare with the Rasulids==
Nevertheless, warfare broke out between al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar and the Rasulid Sultan al-Yuzavavafa Fesuy in 1288. Peace was concluded in July in that year, and the tribes Banu Hayy, Banu Siham, U'rush and Banu Mutim were acknowledged as subjects of the imam.&lt;ref&gt;El-Khazreji, 1906, pp. 215-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh Zaidi-Rasulid fighting erupted in 1291. This time the mountainous trench of the imam was overrun, and he had to roam around from place to place, eventually establishing himself in [[Hajjah]]. The powerful Sultan al-Muzaffar Yusuf died in 1296, which evoked a respectful remark from the imam: "The greatest king of Yemen, the [[Mu'awiyah]] of the time, has died. His pens used to break our lances and swords to pieces."&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Ali, ''Islamic Dynasties of the Arab East''. New Delhi 1996, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; And actually, the Zaidis took the opportunity to seize Lijam, Na'man and [[Sa'dah]]. The imam was able to conclude peace and keep the acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;El-Khazreji, 1906, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, in 1298, he died. Unlike the five previous imams, he could maintain a strong position for decades in spite of periodic setbacks. The imam was celebrated under the honorific ''al-Muzallal bi'l-Ghamama'', since he was once miraculously saved by a cloud when he was pursued by Sultan al-Mu'ayyad Da'ud in Khawlan.&lt;ref&gt;''Enzyklopädie des Islam'', Vol. IV. Leiden 1934, p. 1296.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by his son [[al-Mahdi Muhammad bin al-Mutahhar]]

'''Ali Ahmad Kurd''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|على احمد كُرد}}}}), is a Pakistani lawyer who has been president of the [[Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan]] and is prominent in the [[Lawyers' Movement]] in that country. He opposed former [[President of Pakistan|Pakistani President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=The Nation |title=Kurd declines to appear before CJP |first=Bari |last=Baloch |date=3 April 2012 |url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/03-Apr-2012/kurd-declines-to-appear-before-cjp |accessdate=24 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416114908/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/03-Apr-2012/kurd-declines-to-appear-before-cjp |archive-date=16 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Dawn |url=http://archives.dawn.com/2008/02/05/nat33.htm |title=Justice Sharif asks Musharraf to quit |date=5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==
While vice-chairman of the Balochistan Bar Association in 2002, Ali Ahmad Kurd staged a protest burning of amendments to the constitution that had been proposed by Musharraf. The action formed part of wider protests by lawyers' associations, religious bodies and political parties in reaction to what they perceived to be attempts by Musharraf to undermine his opponents and consolidate his own power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=The Tribune |location=Chandigarh |date=8 July 2002 |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020708/world.htm |accessdate=24 December 2012 |title=General Musharraf bans third term for PM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurd was briefly detained on 29 April 2007 in [[Quetta]] on the charges of inciting people during an absentia funeral of [[Nawab Akbar Bugti]] a year earlier. His detention was protested by lawyers and police released him, claiming that there had been no arrest and that the matter was a misunderstanding. Kurd was at that time vice-chairman of the [[Pakistan Bar Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C04%5C29%5Cstory_29-4-2007_pg7_47 |title=Lawyers denounce Kurd's arrest |newspaper=Daily Times |location=Pakistan |date=9 December 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016203731/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C04%5C29%5Cstory_29-4-2007_pg7_47 |archivedate=16 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.paktribune.com/news/print.php?id=176603 |title=CJ's lawyer booked |publisher=Pak Tribune - Pakistan News Service|accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=The Daily Times |date=29 April 2007 |title=Police arrest CJP’s lawyer, release on high command’s order |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007\story_29-4-2007_pg7_25 |accessdate=24 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103175734/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C04%5C29%5Cstory_29-4-2007_pg7_25 |archivedate=3 November 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After imposing martial law in Pakistan on 3 November 2007, Musharraf suspended the constitution and Kurd was among those placed under house arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.oneindia.in/2007/11/19/sc-dismisses-petitions-against-musharrafs-re-election-1195476080.html |title=SC dismisses petitions against Musharraf's re-election |publisher=One India |date=19 November 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=RTÉ |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/1104/pakistan.html |title=Sharif calls on Musharraf to step down |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/world/asia/06iht-detainee.1.9036609.html |title=Critics in Pakistan muzzled |first=Somini |last=Sengupta |date=6 January 2008 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Dawn |url=http://archives.dawn.com/2008/03/14/nat10.htm |title=Kurd lashes out at anti-judiciary forces |date=14 March 2008 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in March 2009 when President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Kurd led protests by lawyers seeking the return of an independent judiciary. These protests were influential in the reinstatement of [[Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry]] as Chief Justice. Chaudhry had been removed from his position by Musharraf and the decision was not reversed under the presidency of [[Asif Ali Zardari]] until the lawyers began a mass march from [[Lahore]] to [[Islamabad]] that was supported by large crowds and coincided with rioting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |title=Pakistan agrees to reinstate former chief justice |first=Saeed |last=Shah |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=24 December 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/16/pakistan-islamabad-protesters-halted}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=The Nation |title=Long march blocked |date=13 March 2009 |url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/politics/13-Mar-2009/Long-march-blocked |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Kurd was considered as a nominee for the post of [[Chief Election Commissioner of Pakistan]] by the [[Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz]] but was ruled out of contention due to constitutional ineligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=The Express Tribune |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/383948/in-the-running-pml-n-opposition-finalise-three-names-for-cec/ |title=In the running: PML-N, opposition finalise three names for CEC |first=Abdul |last=Manan |date=25 May 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also been considered as a possible caretaker prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=The Nation |url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/02-Aug-2012/n-for-caretaker-pm-from-smaller-province |title=N for caretaker PM from smaller province |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marés - Madrid.jpg|thumb|''The world upside down'' – a 19th-century [[Spanish language]] auca from the print shop of J. M. Marés in Madrid. A poor man gives [[alms]] to a rich man, men are grazing supervised by sheep, etc.]]

An '''auca''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈawkə}}) is a genre of a story in pictures developed mainly in [[Catalonia]]. 

==Description==
The auca was present in some other parts of [[Spain]], even though it was most popular in Catalonia. It has a structure somewhat similar to [[comics]], but has more rigid.  The auca includes a number of images that can be evenly divided by 4 (usually 48), all images are of the same size, all fit on one page, and there is a small piece of text, called ''rodolí'' ({{IPA-ca|ruðuˈɫi|pron}}, plural ''rodolins'') - underneath every image, usually in the [[Catalan language]] and since the 19th century also [[rhyme]]d.

==History==
The auca began as a [[card game]] played for money. The cards were possibly also used for [[divination]], judging by the images that initially appeared on them - the [[Moon]], the [[Sun]], [[star (polygon)|stars]] and [[animal]]s, among them a [[goose]], which gave its name to the game - ''auca'' means "goose" in the north-western dialects of Catalan (''oca'' in modern standard Catalan). The earliest preserved auca was created by [[Pere Abadal]] in 1670 in [[Moià]]. The game was forbidden throughout the 17th and 18th centuries and gradually the auca developed into an art form in which all the images appeared on one page and had a unifying theme, initially - arts, crafts, children's games and animals.

In the 19th century the auca reached its artistic peak and developed into a complete art form and publishing niche. The themes of auca stories became more varied and included [[history]], [[biography]], [[seny|traditional moral stories]] and [[fables]]. It was then that text underneath the images took the form of two rhymed lines. The most important auca artists of that time were [[Josep Piferrer]] and [[Ignasi Estivill]] from [[Barcelona]] and [[Agustí Laborda]] and [[Ildefons Mompié]] from [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]. 

The auca structure also inspired [[Santiago Rusiñol]]'s play ''[[L'auca del senyor Esteve]]'' (''Mr. Esteve's auca''), a down-to-earth, often humorous, story about a business-oriented family who suddenly has to deal with the artistic orientation of the young heir.

Towards the end of the 19th century the auca genre began to wane. Many new aucas were simply repeating older themes. At that time, however, aucas were brought to [[Madrid]], where they were positively met. A series of Castilian aucas called ''Aleluya'' ([[Hallelujah]]) were produced with themes of Catholic holidays.

In the 20th century the auca continued to be a unique Catalan way of expression. Newer aucas are being regularly produced by Catalan artists, incorporating newer artistic styles, but keeping the established form of 48 images with two or four lines of rhymed text.

The '''Australian Esperanto Association''' ('''AEA''') is a national [[Esperanto]] association of [[Australia]]. It is affiliated with the [[Universal Esperanto Association]].

==History==
The Australian Esperanto Association was formed in October 1911, during the first Australian congress, attended by 53 Esperantists. In 1976 AEA hosted the first Pacific Congress of Esperanto, in Melbourne. This was attended by 190 people, 51 from overseas. In 1988 it hosted the 4th Pacific Congress in Brisbane, with 204 attending, 76 from overseas.

In 1997 the 82nd world congress of Esperanto was held in Adelaide. Approximately one thousand Esperantists from 54 countries came to the congress, 820 of them from overseas.

==Affiliations==
AEA is affiliated with the [[Universal Esperanto Association]] (UEA), the International Esperantist Teachers League (ILEI) and with state and city Esperanto organisations, including the Esperanto Federation of New South Wales, Esperanto South Australia and Melbourne Esperanto Association.

AEA publishes in its website a list of local Esperanto clubs and organisations in Australia. Local Esperanto groups exist in [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Adelaide]], [[Brisbane]], [[Hobart]], [[Perth]], [[Canberra]], [[Toowoomba]] (Qld), [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] (NSW), [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] (NSW), [[Torquay, Victoria|Torquay]] (Vic), and [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] (NSW).

==Congress and summer school==
AEA holds a national congress and summer school each year, usually in January, with lectures, workshops, artistic presentations, excursions and classes in the language for beginners and intermediate-level speakers. In March 2016, AEA and the Esperanto associations of Indonesia and New Zealand will hold a three-nation congress in [[Bandung]], Indonesia, the site of the historic [[Bandung Conference|Asia-Africa Conference]] of 1955.

==Journal==
The official journal of the Australian Esperanto Association and the [[New Zealand Esperanto Association]] is “Esperanto sub la Suda Kruco” (Esperanto Beneath the Southern Cross) (ESK). ESK is available both in printed as well as electronic (pdf) format, and is sent out quarterly to every member of both associations.

==Internet TV==
Esperanto-TV is a high-quality [[IPTV|Internet Protocol Television]] (IPTV) service, based in Sydney, which broadcasts content worldwide exclusively in Esperanto. It can be viewed on computer, Android smartphone, iPhone, iPad and (in the USA, Canada, UK and Ireland) on “traditional television” (via [[Roku]] Streaming Player). Esperanto-TV is supported by the Australian Esperanto Association.

==Radio and podcast==
A program of news, interviews and songs in Esperanto is broadcast for one hour every Monday at 1pm by Melbourne ethnic community radio [[3ZZZ]], on 92.3 FM. Programs are also available as podcasts on the Melbourne Esperanto Association website.

==Correspondence courses==
AEA runs its own correspondence courses in Esperanto. Courses are available in several levels, ranging from total beginners, through to experts who wish to polish their Esperanto grammar. Courses are relatively inexpensive, and include textbooks, dictionaries and CDs, as well as private tutors.

==Official examinations==
AEA administers an official examination system, intended to officially test and certify linguistic proficiency in Esperanto. The system is composed of 3 separate tests: '''Elementa''' (basic), '''Supera''' (intermediate) and '''Klereca''' (advanced). Successful completion of one of these tests is sometimes a pre-requisite to receiving scholarships, or entering specific courses.

The official examinations of AEA are made available to all during the annual Congress and Summer School, as well as throughout the year through specially appointed representatives in various local Esperanto organisations throughout the country. The entire examination system is overseen by the AEA Chief Examiner - currently [[Trevor Steele]], a renowned Esperanto author, and member of the [[Academy of Esperanto]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21102">{{Copts}}

[[Copts]] have a long history as a ethnoreligious minority in [[Egypt]], in which Muslim adherents form the majority. Copts lost their majority status in Egypt after the 14th century. 

The question of '''Coptic identity''' was never raised before the rise of pan-Arabism under [[Nasser]] in the early 1950s. Prior to the rise of this notion of Arab identity, Egyptians of all religions identified their ethnicity as Egyptian rather than Arab. [[Egyptian nationalism]] (also referred to as [[Pharaonism]]) was the major form of expression for the [[Egyptians#Identity|Egyptian identity]] of Copts and Muslims.&lt;ref name="Haeri, Niloofar 2003, pp. 47, 136"&gt;Haeri, Niloofar. ''Sacred language, Ordinary People: Dilemmas of Culture and Politics in Egypt''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. 2003, pp. 47, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Copts  viewed themselves as only Copts without any Arab sentiment.&lt;ref name="Deighton, H. S 1946 p. 519"&gt;Deighton, H. S. "The Arab Middle East and the Modern World", International Affairs, vol. xxii, no. 4 (October 1946), p. 519.&lt;/ref&gt;                                                                 The struggle to ascertain this Egyptian identity began as Nasser and his regime tried to impose an [[Arab identity]] on the country, and attempted to erase all references to Egypt as a separate and unique entity.&lt;ref name="nationalcopticassembly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalcopticassembly.com/showart.php?main_id%3D1724 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035013/http://nationalcopticassembly.com/showart.php?main_id=1724 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}{{verify credibility|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The assertions found in a source that definitely represents a Coptic anti-Nasserite POV can hardly be cited as unqualified facts in the lead.--&gt; While most Muslim Egyptians accepted this new Arab identity, very few Copts did. Thus, the emergence of Pan-Arabism served to  exacerbate the ethnic and religious difference between Copts and Muslims in Egypt.

Genetic studies of Coptic Egyptians revealed them to be distinct from Muslim Egyptians insofar as they contained less non-Egyptian ancestry.&lt;ref name="Scientific Reports"&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09996 | doi=10.1038/srep09996| pmid=26017457| pmc=4446898| title=The genetics of East African populations: A Nilo-Saharan component in the African genetic landscape| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=5| pages=9996| year=2015| last1=Dobon| first1=Begoña| last2=Hassan| first2=Hisham Y.| last3=Laayouni| first3=Hafid| last4=Luisi| first4=Pierre| last5=Ricaño-Ponce| first5=Isis| last6=Zhernakova| first6=Alexandra| last7=Wijmenga| first7=Cisca| last8=Tahir| first8=Hanan| last9=Comas| first9=David| last10=Netea| first10=Mihai G.| last11=Bertranpetit| first11=Jaume}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Copts are more closely related to Muslim Egyptians than any other population, and share most of their ancestry with the Muslims. More broadly, studies have showed Copts to be genetically intermediary between the populations of southern Europe and Nubia (two frequently-used reference points), with greater European affinities in the north and greater East African in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Klales, A. R. (2014). "Computed Tomography Analysis and Reconstruction of Ancient Egyptians Originating from the Akhmim Region of Egypt: A Biocultural Perspective". MA Thesis. University of Manitoba. [http://mspace.lib.umanitoba.ca/jspui/bitstream/1993/23992/1/Klales_Alexandra.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; A study of Coptic immigrants from northern Egypt indicated that they are most closely related to Muslim Egyptians, as well as the populations of the southern Levant and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="Scientific Reports" /&gt;

==Copts as Egyptians==

The term '''Copt''' designates the native population of [[Egypt]], as opposed to the various invaders or settlers (Greeks, Romans, Arabs, etc.) that came to Egypt from other countries.

The word ''Copt'' was adopted in English in the 17th century, from [[New Latin]] ''Coptus, Cophtus'', which is derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] collective ''{{transl|ar|qubṭ, qibṭ}}'' {{lang|ar| قبط }} "the Copts" with ''[[Arabic grammar#Nisba|nisba]]'' adjective {{transl|ar|''qubṭī, qibṭī''}} {{lang|ar| قبطي}}, plural {{transl|ar|''aqbāṭ''}} {{lang|ar| أقباط}}; Also ''quftī, qiftī'', Arabic /f/ representing historical Coptic /p/. an Arabisation of the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] word ''kubti'' ([[Coptic language#Bohairic|Bohairic]]) and/or ''kuptaion'' ([[Coptic language#Sahidic|Sahidic]]). The Coptic word is in turn an adaptation of the Greek {{lang|grc|Αἰγύπτιος}} "Egyptian".

After the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], the term ''Copt'' became restricted to those Egyptians who remained adhering to the Christian religion.&lt;ref&gt;"The people of Egypt before the Arab conquest in the 7th century identified themselves and their language in Greek as Aigyptios (Arabic qibt, Westernized as Copt); when Egyptian Muslims later ceased to call themselves Aigyptioi, the term became the distinctive name of the Christian minority." [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026216 Coptic Orthodox Church]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In their own [[Coptic language]], which represents the final stage of the [[Egyptian language]], the Copts referred to themselves as ''rem en kēme'' (Sahidic) &lt;span style="font-size:140%;"&gt;&lt;span lang="cop-Copt" style="font-size:100%;font-family:'Arial Coptic', 'New Athena Unicode', 'MPH 2B Damase', 'Quivira', 'Analecta';"&gt;ⲣⲙⲛⲕⲏⲙⲉ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, ''lem en kēmi'' ([[Coptic language#Fayyumic|Fayyumic]]), ''rem en khēmi'' (Bohairic) &lt;span style="font-size:140%;"&gt;&lt;span lang="cop-Copt" style="font-size:100%;font-family:'Arial Coptic', 'New Athena Unicode', 'MPH 2B Damase', 'Quivira', 'Analecta';"&gt;ⲣⲉⲙ̀ⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which literally means "people of Egypt" or "Egyptians"; cf. [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''{{lang|egy-Latn|rmṯ n [[Km (hieroglyph)|kmt]]}}'', [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] ''{{lang|egy-Latn|rmt n kmỉ}}''.


Copts take particular pride in their Egyptian identity. Over the centuries, they have always rejected and fought against other identities that foreign rulers attempted to force upon them, stressing their own Egyptian identity.&lt;ref name="Werthmuller, Kurt J 1250"&gt;Werthmuller, Kurt J. Coptic Identity and Ayyubid Politics in Egypt 1218–1250. American University in Cairo Press. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While an integral part of their society, Copts remained culturally and religiously distinct from their surrounding.

==Egyptian Liberal Age==
{{Main|Egypt's Liberal Experiment|Liberalism in Egypt}}
Egypt's struggle for independence from both the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] was marked by secular [[Egyptian nationalism]], also referred to as [[Pharaonism]]. When the Egyptian nationalist leader [[Saad Zaghlul]] met the Arab delegates at Versailles in 1918, he insisted that their struggles for statehood were not connected, stressing that the problem of Egypt was an Egyptian problem and not an Arab one.&lt;ref&gt;Makropoulou, Ifigenia. [http://www.ekem.gr/archives/2007/01/pan_arabism_wha.html Pan - Arabism: What Destroyed the Ideology of Arab Nationalism? Hellenic Center for European Studies. January 15, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian nationalism rose to prominence in the 1920s and 1930s. It looked to Egypt's pre-[[Islamic]] past and argued that Egypt was part of a larger [[Mediterranean]] civilization. This ideology stressed the role of the [[Nile River]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It became the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian anti-colonial activists of the pre- and inter-war periods. There was no place for an Arab component in the Egyptian personality at that time, and Egyptians had no Arab orientation as they saw themselves as Egyptians first and foremost, regardless of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, James. "Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism" in Rashid Khalidi, ed. ''The Origins of Arab Nationalism''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1990, pp. 244–45&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners visiting Egypt noted that Egyptians did not possess any Arab sentiment in the first half of the 20th century. As one Arab nationalist of the time put it "Egyptians did not accept that Egypt was a part of the Arab lands, and would not acknowledge that the Egyptian people were part of the Arab nation." &lt;ref&gt;Syrian Arab nationalist [[Sati' al-Husri]] qtd in Dawisha, Adeed. ''Arab Nationalism in the Twentieth Century''. Princeton University Press. 2003, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise of Arab nationalism==

Arab nationalism began to gain grounds in Egypt in the 1940s following efforts by Syrian, Palestinian and Lebanese intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, "Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism," p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, by the end of the 1940s and even after the establishment of the [[Arab League]], historian H. S. Deighton was still writing that "Egyptians are not Arabs, and both they and the Arabs are aware of this fact".&lt;ref name="Deighton, H. S 1946 p. 519"/&gt;

It was not until the [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] era – more than a decade later – that Arab nationalism, and by extension [[Arab socialism]], became a state policy imposed on the Egyptians by the new dictatorship. Under Nasser, Egypt united with [[Syria]] to form the [[United Arab Republic]] in 1958, then became known as the ''Arab'' Republic of Egypt in 1961. The Egyptians' attachment to Arabism, however, was particularly questioned after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. Thousands of Egyptians had lost their lives and the country became disillusioned with Arab politics.&lt;ref&gt;Dawisha, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Nasser's successor [[Anwar Al Sadat|Sadat]], both through public policy and his peace initiative with [[Israel]], revived an uncontested Egyptian orientation, unequivocally asserting that only Egypt and Egyptians were his responsibility. The terms "Arab", "Arabism" and "Arab unity", save for the new official name, became conspicuously absent.&lt;ref&gt;Dawisha, pp. 264–65, 267&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Egyptians#Liberal age|Egyptian Liberal age]] and [[Egyptians#Republic|Egyptian Republic]].)

==Copts and Arab identity==
[[File:Coptic cross.svg|left|220px|Coptic Orthodox Cross with traditional Coptic script reading: 'Jesus Christ, the Son of God']]

While some non-Coptic authors claim that Copts in Egypt have an Arab identity while Copts in the West tend to identify as "non-Arab",&lt;ref name=Abrahamp231&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Arab Detroit: from margin to mainstream]]|first1=Nabeel|last1=Abraham|first2=Andrew|last2=Shryock|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8143-2812-5|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5cw3WKvVt4MC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=coptic+%22arab+identity%22&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=8#v=onepage&amp;q=coptic&amp;f=false 9].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a713718965&amp;db=all|title=The Egyptian Coptic Christians: the conflict between identity and equality|author=Randall P. Henderson|journal=Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations|volume=16|issue=2|date=April 2005|pages=155–166|doi=10.1080/09596410500059664}}&lt;/ref&gt; other non-Coptic scholars disagree, stating that "Copts are not Arabs" and that they predate the Arabs' arrival to Egypt &lt;ref&gt;Prof. Constantine Gutzman, Chair of the Department of History at Western Connecticut State University: "Copts are not Arabs. Rather, they are the people who lived in Egypt before the Arabs arrived. The pharaohs were Copts, as were St. Athanasius and St. Anthony."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post: Copts are not Arabs. January 4, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, almost all statements issued by Copts decry Arab nationalism. With their strong attachment to their own country, Copts have been always suspicious of Arabism, Arab socialism and pan-Arabism. They viewed Arabs as invaders and foreigners, and glorified the struggles of their ancestors against the Arab invaders between the 7th and the 9th centuries AD. Indubitably, the struggle against these foreign ideologies centered around the [[Coptic language]]:

{{cquote|The [[Coptic language]] provides a Copt with an identity that spells out an impressive commentary upon the character of such person. It exemplifies in him an unyielding spirit that was tried and came out victorious. A spirit that had to endure endless attempts by those that ruled Egypt for the past 2300 years to replace such language with that of their own. If such was achieved then they can subject the Copts to cultural and religious slavery that would forever made them subservient to such foreign rulers. It was attempted first by the [[Greeks]], through their Hellenizing approach. Then it was continued along the same principles by the successive Arab and Muslim dynasties that ruled Egypt since the 7th century AD. The significance of such character can also inspire the Coptic youth to fight off the many harmful pressures, whether in spirit or in body, that are facing them in this turbulent Society of ours.&lt;ref name="stshenouda.com"/&gt;}}

In addition, Copts resisted Arab nationalism by stressing their pre-Arab identity. They saw themselves as the direct descendants of the [[Ancient Egyptians]], and their [[Coptic language|language]] as a bridge linking the Copts to their Ancient Egyptian roots and their civilization that span over 6000 years.&lt;ref name="stshenouda.com"&gt;[http://www.stshenouda.com/coptlang/coptval.htm Takla, Hany. The Value of Coptic, The Ecclesiastical and Coptic Principles. Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite Society for Coptic Studies. 02/10/1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

The strongest statement regarding Coptic identity came in 2008 from a prominent Coptic bishop, namely Bishop Thomas of [[Cusae]] and [[Meir, Egypt|Meir]], who gave the following speech at the [[Hudson Institute]]:

{{cquote|What makes a person change the identity of his own nation and shift the focus of his identity from Egypt to become "the Arabs", even though ethnically he/she is the same person? The Copts have been always focused on Egypt; it's our identity, it's our nation, it's our land, it's our language, it's our culture. But when some of the Egyptians converted to [[Islam]], their focus changed away from looking to their own [language and culture]. They started to look to the [[Arabian]]s, and [[Arabia]] became their main focus. So the focus here has changed and they would no longer be called "Copts". '''If you come to a Coptic person and tell him that he's an Arab, that's offensive'''. '''We are not Arabs, we are Egyptians'''. I am very happy to be an Egyptian and I would not accept being "Arab" because ethnically I am not. I speak Arabic. Politically now, I am part of a country that was Arabized and politically I belong to an Arabic country but that doesn't make a person Arab. If a person believes he is an Arab, his main focus is the pan-Arab area, and he no longer belongs to the Egyptian nation. You are either in or out; either you belong or you don't. And this is a big dilemma that is happening for the Copts who kept their Christianity, or rather their identity as Egyptians with their own culture, and who are trying to keep the language, the music, and the calendar of the Copts. That means that the culture of Ancient Egypt is still carried on. A process of [[Arabization]] has been ongoing in this country for many centuries, since the 7th century. At the same time [[Islamization]] as well is a dilemma that started and is still carrying a lot of the problems. [...] So when we hear the word "Copt", that doesn't only mean "Christian", it means "Egyptian".}}

{{cquote|What makes an Egyptian become a Copt, and an Egyptian not become a Copt? Simply, this is the shift that has happened in Egypt since the [[Arab invasion of Egypt]]. Today when you look at a Copt, you don't see only a Christian, but you see an Egyptian who is trying to keep his identity versus another imported identity that is working on him. And that means if these two processes are still actively working till now, it has never stopped because Egypt has not yet in its own mind become completely Islamized or Arabized. That means the process [of Arabization] is still ongoing... You can't study the [[Coptic language]], the native language of the land, in any public school in Egypt. That's not allowed, although we can teach in our public schools any other language. You have a lot of schools that teach English, French, German, Spanish and Greek, but never Coptic. Why? Because that clashes with the process of Arabization. And this is a very dangerous attitude. The cultural heritage of Egypt has been taken away. [Thus], the Copts suddenly felt that they have a responsibility to carry on their own culture and continue it and to fight for it. Yes, we are still fighting very much for our strong heritage of Egypt because we love our heritage and we want to keep it. And that means that if you try to teach your language in a public school, that would not be the right way to do it, so that means that the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church]] will carry the responsibility to take in this heritage and work with it, keeping it in a very good nursery till the time would come when openness and good thinking would occur, when this country will come back to its own roots and lift it up. But, until then we have to keep it in a nursery, in a church. We don't want to keep it in, we don't want to isolate it, but we cannot throw it away so nobody will take care of it. That's why we keep it. This is not withdrawal. We could say that this is keeping the heritage in a nursery till the time comes when it will be open and serve the entire Egyptian community. So the word "Copt" here is not only religious, but it has cultural import.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop Thomas of [[Cusae]] and [[Meir, Egypt|Meir]]. Egypt's Coptic Christians: The Experience of the Middle East's largest Christian community during a time of rising Islamization. July 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bishop Thomas' words gained widespread approval within the Coptic community. One other Coptic bishop, namely Bishop Picenti of [[Helwan]] and [[Massarah]] commented on the issue saying:
{{cquote|If one reconsiders Bishop Thomas' words, they can discover that he was not wrong. He said that '''Copts of Egypt are not of Arab origin but rather of Pharaonic origin''', and this is correct because it is the truth and history. We are Coptic Egyptians. We are Pharaonic Copts. Coptic meaning ancient Egyptian who then converted to christianity. Copt, is essentially another term for Coptic christians&lt;ref&gt;Ranya Badawi. An interview with Bishop Pecenti of Helwan and Massarah. El-Masry El-Yom Newspaper. November 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other prominent Coptic figures who supported Bishop Thomas' statement included the Coptic writer Magdy Khalil who wrote in el-Dostoor newspaper:
{{cquote|'''We [the Copts] are Egyptians, and we are not Arabs''', with all due respect to the Arabs. We may live in some sort of cultural Arabism and we may speak Arabic, but we are not Arabs. This is a historical fact, whether some people like it or not. Copts both within Egypt and in the diaspora are insulted and accused because they insist on holding strongly to and taking pride in their national Egyptian identity, rather than having another identity that crosses the borders [of Egypt]. The Copts' focus their identity on Egypt's geographical borders, which are deeply rooted in history.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://dostor.org/ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=659&amp;Itemid=75 Khalil, Magdy. ''Copts are truly facing a problem of Islamization, and what Bishop Thomas said was said before by many Egyptian intellectuals''. In el-Dostoor newspaper. 08/17/2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220151536/http://dostor.org/ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=659&amp;Itemid=75 |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, Copts today believe that Egypt and Egyptians are simply not Arab, emphasizing indigenous Egyptian heritage and culture. Their perception of their own identity and heritage can be summarized in [[Niloofar Haeri]]'s words:
{{cquote|Egyptians had to be made, often forcefully, into "Arabs" because they did not historically identify themselves as such. Egypt was self-consciously a nation not only before pan-Arabism but also before becoming a colony of the British Empire. Its territorial continuity since ancient times, its unique history as exemplified in its pharaonic past and later on its Coptic language and culture, had already made Egypt into a nation for centuries. Egyptians saw themselves, their history, culture and language as specifically Egyptian and not "Arab."&lt;ref name="Haeri, Niloofar 2003, pp. 47, 136"/&gt;}}

The '''Digital Writing and Research Lab (DWRL)''' is a research lab at [[The University of Texas at Austin]], United States, dedicated to the identification and promotion of twenty-first-century literacies. These literacies range from navigating online newsfeeds and participating in social networking sites to composing multimedia texts that require producing, sampling, and/or remixing media content.

The lab is staffed by graduate student researchers and instructors at The University of Texas at Austin who participate in research groups, teach in computer classrooms, and hold workshops on digital pedagogy. ''"Staff work involves both routine classroom support and participation in on-going Lab projects such as the development of computer-based instructional materials (courseware) and documentation, as well as identification and documentation of successful pedagogical practices and research into other pedagogical applications of computer technology."''&lt;ref&gt;Slatin, John. "The Computer Writing and Research Lab: A Brief Institutional History" ''Language Learning Online.'' Austin, TX: Deadalus Group Inc, 1998. pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1985 as the Computer Research Lab (CRL), the lab was known as the Computer Writing and Research Lab (CWRL) from the 1990s to 2010, when it became the Digital Writing and Research Lab (DWRL).

== Programs ==
The DWRL launches yearly programs offering instructors tools to teach communicative competencies. These competencies include: proficiency in software packages and technological devices; the ability to collaborate across barriers; confidence in producing, analyzing and sharing information in various digital formats; and skills to manage, analyze, and synthesize multiple streams of simultaneous information.

== Publications ==
* "'[http://viz.cwrl.utexas.edu/ viz.]'" - ''"The award-winning and widely-read digital publication viz. is committed to the intersections of Rhetoric and visual culture. In keeping with its mission to promote visual literacy, the viz. blog presents a daily community forum for discussing images in the digital age." Viz also produces static content in arenas such as multi-form interviews, assignments, theory pages, and teaching guides.''&lt;ref&gt;“About viz.” "viz." University of Texas at Austin. Web. 26 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "'[http://bloggingpedagogy.dwrl.utexas.edu/ Blogging Pedagogy]'" - ''Blogging Pedagogy'' offers reflections on teaching practices in English and writing studies. The blog is open to members of these pedagogical communities who want to share resources, engage their peers in discussions of best practices, and reflect on successes and challenges.
* "'[http://lessonplans.dwrl.utexas.edu/ Lesson Plan Library]'" - A collection of ''"innovative technology-based lesson plans and classroom assignments created by DWRL Instructors. The lesson plans address a broad spectrum of pedagogical activities—from initial brainstorming to electronic peer review, from interactive visual rhetoric lessons to collaborative multi-media online publications."'' Users will find activities that range from one class period to semester-long assignments.&lt;ref&gt;“About Us.” "DWRL Lesson Plans." University of Texas at Austin. Web. 28 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "'[http://currents.cwrl.utexas.edu/ Currents in Electronic Literacy]'" - “Currents in Electronic Literacy" is a journal indexed in the MLA International Bibliography and EBSCO (ISSN 1524-6493); it is internally peer reviewed by a cohort of graduate students and faculty at the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;ref&gt;“Statement of Purpose.” "Currents." University of Texas at Austin. Web. 26 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues have featured articles and interviews by leaders in the fields of literacy, literature, technology, and rhetoric including Barbara Biesecker, Alex Reid, Josh Gunn, [[Lawrence Lessig]], Bret Benjamin, Stuart Selber, [[Robert Scholes]], Alan Liu, and [[Avital Ronell]] among others.
* "'[http://jump.dwrl.utexas.edu/ The Journal for Undergraduate Multimedia Projects]'" - "TheJUMP" publishes submissions from undergraduate students that display successful engagement with digital technologies and use rhetorical elements to make an argument, tell a story, or share research. Essential to the mission of "TheJUMP" is the promotion of discourse about multimedia pedagogy and student learning. To that end, each piece is published alongside course and assignment information as well as reflections from the student author and his/her instructor and responses from two members of "TheJUMP" editorial collective.

== Initiatives ==
Each year, the DWRL designs and implements research projects.  These year-long initiatives enhance graduate instructors' professional and teaching portfolios. The research produced results in [[white papers]], conference presentations, [[video clip|videos]], and pedagogical resources like lesson plans. Project leaders, members and [[lab specialists]] also offer [[workshops]] throughout the year which share tools for pedagogical innovation.  The results of the research conducted in the project groups is presented every year at the [[DWRL Final Showcase]] as well as archived online.

=== Research initiatives ===
* '''Gaming Pedagogy''' - The group is researching the potential and applicability of a games in the classroom, whether those be tabletop games, educational games, commercial video games, or games made by independent groups and will publish an eBook to showcase their findings. They are building on the work of the Immersive Environments group, which has explores the intersections among gaming, pedagogy, and virtual worlds and which designed and implemented two games in the rhetoric classroom: "Rhetorical Peaks'' and "Battle Lines".
* '''Audio Video Research''' - Now in its second year, the ARVG group is creating an audio podcast series spotlighting intersections of rhetoric and technology. The 2011-12 group collaborated with the Undergraduate Writing Center on the WRITE series—videos that feature writers at all levels talking about their writing processes—as well as a prototype for an online tutorial series.
* '''Currents in Electronic Literacy''' - In addition to soliciting, editing, and publishing the [[annual issue]] of the DWRL’s e-journal Currents in Electronic Literacy, members of the group research digital publication platforms and optimization strategies for mobile viewing.
* '''Visual Rhetoric''' - In addition to producing the DWRL’s award-winning visual rhetoric blog, viz., the Visual Rhetoric group have collaborated with the Harry Ransom Center (HRC). The group will engage with the HRC's collections and exhibitions to extend their research in visual rhetoric.
* '''The Journal for Undergraduate Multimedia Projects (TheJUMP)''' - This group publishes TheJUMP twice annually and serves as a resource for other DWRL members on issues of accessibility and undergraduate publication.

== Courses and classrooms ==
The courses taught throughout the DWRL are Rhetoric and English classes which benefit from a computer-learning environment. Computer classrooms allow students access to learning technologies including their own Mac desktop computer. Instructors control a teacher station through which they are able to project images, websites and video.  All students enrolled in courses conducted in computer classrooms have access to a computer lab.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The DWRL began in 1985 with the acquisition of twelve [[IBM]] microcomputers as a result of a Project QUEST grant to the University of Texas at Austin.  English department faculty member Jerome Bump and his graduate students later arranged for the machines to be moved from the University Writing Center (housed in the English department) to vacant space in the basement of the Undergraduate Library.  This space was deemed the Computer Research Lab (CRL) and marked the beginning of the research into computer-based writing at The University of Texas at Austin.

In fall 1986 Bump offered a graduate seminar on rhetoric and computers, which he co-taught with Lt. Col. Hugh Burns.  Burns, who worked in the Intelligent Systems Division at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, had written the first dissertation in what became the academic field of Computers and Writing.  Graduate students in this seminar sought to advance Burns’s efforts to explore how the computer could serve less as a “teaching machine” and more as a constructive partner in dialogue with student-writers.&lt;ref&gt;Slatin, John. "The Computer Writing and Research Lab: A Brief Institutional History" ''Language Learning Online.'' Austin, TX: Deadalus Group Inc, 1998. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Theoretically, this work aligned well with the emerging “process” model of writing instruction, and Burns’s presence lent national credibility to the group. Burns coined the name of the new Computer Research Lab.

Participants in the newly established lab dedicated their efforts to finding alternative models for the writing classroom. The lab’s first [[local area network (LAN)]] allowed computers in the lab to be linked to one another, as well as to machines in an adjacent instructional room.  This arrangement eventually enabled colleagues from the English department to teach first-year English courses in the CRL’s first "computational classroom" as Bump and his graduate students called it.

=== Early products ===
Graduate student Fred Kemp’s software ''Idealog'' focused on invention or pre-writing, while his colleague Paul Taylor’s ''Descant'' assisted revision. Other students, moving away from the “process” instructional model that underpinned these two, developed programs of their own that prioritized social interaction.  These included Locke Carter’s ''In-Class Mail'' and Paul Taylor’s ''Forum5''.  Even though the programs emerged from different theoretical assumptions, they could be used together.&lt;ref&gt;Slatin, John. "The Computer Writing and Research Lab: A Brief Institutional History" ''Language Learning Online.'' Austin, TX: Deadalus Group Inc, 1998. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

They also supplied the foundation for the most notable achievement of the lab’s formative years, the [http://www.daedalus.com/products_diwe_overview.asp ''Daedalus Integrated Writing Environment'' (DIWE)], a suite of applications that integrated elements of the writing process. DIWE included four major modules: ''Invent, Respond, Mail'' (an asynchronous, internal messaging system), and ''InterChange'' (a conferencing system that allowed for synchronous—real-time—interaction among students and instructors). Several scholars went on to praise ''InterChange'', in particular, for its capacity to transform the dynamics of a writing classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Slatin, John. "The Computer Writing and Research Lab: A Brief Institutional History" ''Language Learning Online.'' Austin, TX: Deadalus Group Inc, 1998.p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Focus on Digital Pedagogy ===
In January 1989, under the leadership of director John Slatin, the lab’s staff began to assemble an archive of pedagogical texts—materials associated with the lab’s attempts to conduct writing instruction in computer classrooms—and co-hosted the sixth Conference on Computers and Writing.

Slatin wrote a funding proposal that increased the university-wide visibility of the CRL, eventually establishing computer labs and networks and disseminating new DIWE software across departments on UT-Austin’s campus.  Funding for additional labs and multimedia hardware also tightened the ties between the CRL and the English department and, later, the new Division of Rhetoric and Composition (which, upon its creation in 1993, assumed administrative oversight of the CRL).&lt;ref&gt;Slatin, John. "The Computer Writing and Research Lab: A Brief Institutional History" ''Language Learning Online.'' Austin, TX: Deadalus Group Inc, 1998. pp. 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lab’s institutional growth continued with the hiring in 1994 of faculty member Margaret Syverson, trained in Computers and Writing, and the recruitment of additional graduate students. Syverson directed the rechristened Computer Writing and Research Lab from 1994 to 2004.

From 2004 to 2008 Clay Spinuzzi directed the CWRL. In 2004 the CWRL hired current systems administrator D. Hampton Finger, who facilitated the lab's switch to [[Drupal]] for its web content management.  This shift allowed for greater accessibility and made personal [[Drupal]] installations available for instructors.  As a result of a university pilot program using WebXM to ensure web accessibility, in October 2006 the CWRL lowered its webpage's structural accessibility violations from 3100 pages to zero.

During 2004-2005, the CWRL created a workgroup model in which workgroup leaders assemble small teams to work on particular projects, allowing for greater continuity from year to year.  From 2006 to 2008, the CWRL pursued outside partnerships. The lab redeveloped and rationalized archives of English and rhetoric exercises in a system called eFiles, and developed [http://viz.cwrl.utexas.edu viz.], a blog about visual rhetoric.

[[File:Australian Census 2011 demographic map - Inner Sydney by POA - BCP field 1456 Egypt Total.svg|thumb|right|People born in Egypt as a percentage of the population in Sydney divided geographically by postal area, as of the 2011 census.]]
'''Egyptian Australians''' are [[Australian]] citizens and Australian permanent residents of [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] descent. According to the Australian 2011 Census, 36,532 Australian citizens and permanent residents declared that they were born in [[Egypt]],&lt;ref name="COB 2011"/&gt; while based on the 2006 Census, at least an additional 31,786 declared that they were of full or partial Egyptian ancestry and born in a country other than Egypt (including most numerously Australian-born persons of full or partial Egyptian ancestry).&lt;ref name="ancestry" /&gt;

An additional 1,890 persons in the 2006 Census reported themselves as being of "[[Copt]]ic" ancestry. The term Coptic ordinarily refers to adherents of Coptic Christianity, but when used as a term referring to ethnicity means "Egyptian" (almost always in the context of Coptic Christian Egyptians). The 1,890 persons who described their ancestry as "Coptic" are thus most likely Egyptian Australians.&lt;ref name="ancestry" /&gt;

Copt as an [[ethnonym]] is etymologically derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "Aiguptious," literally meaning "Egyptian," from the [[Egyptian language|Late Egyptian]] word "Gyptios", via the [[Classical Arabic]] "Qubt", into the English "Copt". The word ordinarily refers to Coptic Christian Egyptians, though there have been instances of Muslim Egyptians referring to themselves as "Copts" to emphasise the non-Arabian ancestral origin of Egyptians in general.

The 2006 Census shows that the majority of Egypt-born Australians are located in [[Sydney]] (16,238) or [[Melbourne]] (11,156), with smaller communities located in Perth (1,407), Adelaide (982) and Brisbane (897).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/download?format=xls&amp;collection=Census&amp;period=2006&amp;productlabel=Country|title=Redirect to Census data page|website=Censusdata.abs.gov.au|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Egyptian Australians are [[Christians]], which is in contrast to the religious affiliation to [[Islam]] of the majority of the population of ethnic Egyptians within modern Egypt. Centuries of a steady continuous rate of conversions of the local indigenous Egyptian population has resulted in modern Egypt's [[Muslim]] majority, although the indigenous Christian Church of Egypt has retained a sizeable minority throughout its history, up until today. Christians comprise much of the Egyptian diaspora, both in Australia and elsewhere. The majority religion of Egypt before the introduction of Islam from [[Arabia]] was [[Christianity]], and prior to introduction of Christianity to Egypt the majority religion was the [[Ancient Egyptian religion]].

Some 19,928 Australian citizens and residents declared membership of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]] at the 2006 Census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/download?format=xls&amp;collection=Census&amp;period=2006&amp;productlabel=Religious|title=Redirect to Census data page|website=Censusdata.abs.gov.au|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Egyptian Christians, however, may simply have declared themselves "Christian" without specifying the Coptic denomination, while other Egyptian Christians may belong to various other denominations, either born into or converted. In 2003, however, it was claimed in the [[New South Wales]] Parliament that there were in fact 70,000 Copts in New South Wales alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20031112040|title=Coptic Orthodox Church (NSW) Property Trust Amendment Bill|work=Parliament of New South Wales, Hansard|date=12 November 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304202701/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20031112040|archivedate=4 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emigration from Egypt was significant in the late 1940s and 1950s, disproportionately so for non-Muslim religious minorities escaping the growing Arab nationalist movement in Egypt which saw the overthrow of the Egyptian monarchy and the subsequent [[Suez Crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/origins/history.aspx?pid=15|title=Origins: History of immigration from Egypt - Immigration Museum, Melbourne Australia|website=Museumvictoria.com.au|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total numbers, Egyptian Christians were the largest contingent of emigrants to leave Egypt for other countries, including to Australia. Christians were the second largest in terms of proportion to their original community size in Egypt. [[Egyptian Jews]], as a proportion of their original community size in Egypt, were the largest emigrant community to leave Egypt (they were the second largest in total numbers). The number of Jews in Egypt numbered around 75,000 in 1948, and following the establishment of the State of Israel that same year, almost the entire population left in the subsequent years during the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]], settling largely in Israel, USA, Europe, Latin America, and around 2,000 settling in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/1145/1/01front.pdf|title=The Migration Experience of the Jews of Egypt to Australia 1948 – 1967, Rachel Marlene Barda|website=Ses.library.usyd.edu.au|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian Jewish population in Australia is concentrated particularly in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishaustralia.com/?Page=communityhistory|title=Jewish Australia|first=Jewish Australia Online|last=Network|website=Jewishaustralia.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, only 6 Jews remain in Egypt today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/egypt-s-jewish-community-diminished-6-women-after-death-lucy-saul|title=Egypt's Jewish community diminished to 6 women after death of Lucy Saul - Egypt Independent|date=30 July 2016|website=Egyptindependent.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Even language''' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|v|ɛ|n}}, also known as '''Lamut''', '''Ewen''', '''Eben''', '''Orich''', '''Ilqan''' ({{lang-ru|Эве́нский язы́к}}, earlier also {{lang|ru|Ламутский язы́к}}), is a [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] language spoken by the [[Evens]] in Siberia.  It is spoken by widely scattered communities of reindeer herders from [[Kamchatka]] and the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the east to the [[Lena River|River Lena]] in the west, and from the [[Arctic coast]] in the north to the River [[Aldan River|Aldan]] in the south. Even is an [[endangered language]], with only some 5,700 speakers (Russian census, 2010). These speakers are specifically from the Magadan region, the Chukot region and the Koryak region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/even.htm|title=Even (Lamut) language and alphabet|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dialects are Arman, Indigirka, Kamchatka, Kolyma-Omolon, Okhotsk, Ola, Tompon, Upper Kolyma, Sakkyryr, Lamunkhin.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.  Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In these regions where the Evens primarily reside, the Even language is generally implemented in pre-school and elementary school, alongside the national language, [[Russian language|Russian]]. Where Even functioned primarily as an [[oral language]] communicated between reindeer herding brigades, textbooks began circulating throughout these educational institutions from around 1925 to 1995. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lingsib.iea.ras.ru/en/languages/even.shtml|title=Endangered Languages of Siberia - The Even Language|website=lingsib.iea.ras.ru|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The syntax of the Even language follows the nominative case and SOV (subject-object-verb) word order, with the attribute preceding the dependent member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lingsib.iea.ras.ru/en/languages/even.shtml|title=Endangered Languages of Siberia - The Even Language|website=lingsib.iea.ras.ru|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language contact==
In some remote Arctic villages, such as [[Russkoye Ustye]], whose population descended from Russian-Even intermarriage, the language spoken into the 20th century was a dialect of Russian with a strong Even influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/lilab/krasovitsky/krasovitsky-eng/archive.htm Russian dialects in East Siberia and Kamchatka]. Reviews such publications as: A. Krasovitsky and Ch. Sappok. "The Isolated Russian Dialectal System in Contact with Tungus Languages in Siberia and Far East"; A.Krasovitsky.

A {{nihongo|'''foreign-born Japanese'''|外国生まれの日本人|gaikoku umare no nihonjin|literally "Japanese person born in a foreign country"}} is a Japanese person of foreign descent or heritage, who was born outside Japan and later acquired Japanese [[citizenship]]. This category encompasses persons of both Japanese and non-Japanese descent. The former subcategory is considered because of intricacies of national and international laws regarding the citizenship of newborn persons.

==Legal issues==
{{See|Japanese nationality law}}

By Japanese law, adults generally cannot hold both foreign citizenship and Japanese citizenship (i.e. [[dual nationality]] is not recognized): 
*those who have acquired dual nationality before age 20 must choose a single nationality before reaching age 22.
*those who have acquired dual nationality after age 20 must choose a single nationality in 2 years.

Many who [[naturalization|naturalize]] as Japanese also adopt a [[Japanese name]], since names must be chosen from a list of approved kanji.  Chinese or Koreans with kanji-character names may or may not have problems in this regard.

No law forbids a foreign-born Japanese to be elected as a member of [[Diet of Japan|Diet]]; [[Marutei Tsurunen]] (born Martti Turunen in Finland) is Japan's first European foreign-born member of the Diet. Theoretically, therefore, a foreign-born Japanese can become the [[Prime Minister of Japan]].

Probably because of the difficulty in gaining citizenship and because of cultural difference, foreign-born Japanese people account for a very small percentage of the population in Japan.  Many who were born and live in Japan permanently, particularly Korean and Chinese, do not naturalize.  There has been a constant discussion among the government and lawmakers whether to expand their rights of [[permanent residency|permanent residence]] to include provisions such as the right to vote in elections, etc.  Few statistics are kept on how many Chinese and Koreans have naturalized, as such statistics are not maintained by the Japanese government.  Once such a person naturalizes, they are, for all intents and purposes under the law, Japanese.

The Japanese [[jus sanguinis]] policy contrasts with other countries, such as in Canada and the United States where people born natively (under [[jus solis]]) acquire citizenship on birth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38716">{{Politics of Mongolia}}
Since its turn towards [[Mongolian Revolution of 1990|democracy in 1990]], [[Mongolia]] has in principle acknowledged the concept of [[human rights|human]] and [[civic rights|civic]] rights. “Human rights law,” according to one human-rights organization, “is a rapidly expanding area in the Mongolian legal system.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law and Human Rights Internships in Mongolia|url=http://www.projects-abroad.org/volunteer-projects/law-and-human-rights/volunteer-mongolia/|work=Projects Abroad|accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2000, Mongolia unilaterally adopted the so-called “Millennium Goal 9,” which is “to strengthen human rights and foster democratic governance.”  Writing in 2012 in the ''Jakarta Post'', the secretary-general of the [[Indonesia]]n Community for [[Democracy]] said of Mongolian president [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj|Elbegdorj Tsakhia]], a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] graduate who “led the first demonstrations for democracy and reforms in Mongolia,” that “the passion for freedom and human rights” is “palpable in his being.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hardjono|first=Ratih|title=Mongolia: Caught between democratization and Rio Tinto|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/31/mongolia-caught-between-democratization-and-rio-tinto.html|work=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Addressing an audience at the Asia Society in New York in 2011, Elbegdorj Tsakhia said: “Freedom, human rights, justice, the rule of law, those values can be enjoyed, even by the poor people, even by poor herdsman in Mongolia.”  The desire for human rights, he said, “is always there,” in all people. “Sometimes that desire can be crushed by tyranny. But it will rise again. That is Mongolia.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mongolia's President Says Human Rights 'Universal'|url=http://asiasociety.org/policy/governance/national/mongolias-president-says-human-rights-universal|work=Asia Society|accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet despite Mongolia's economic and social progress since the end of [[Communism]], the “heritage from the old totalitarian regime,” according to one observer, “is a negative influence on the realization of human rights in Mongolia.” Official abuse of power is widespread, and law-enforcement officers “do not adequately respect the security and liberty of the people.” While the media report frequently on human-rights violations, “most people, except lawyers and professors, have no systematic knowledge on human rights to be able to properly appreciate the news on human rights....People begin to see the real meaning of human rights only after suffering injustice.”&lt;ref name="HUrights Osaka"&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Education in Mongolian Schools: Present State and Challenges|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/human_rights_education_in_asian_schools/section2/2006/03/human-rights-education-in-mongolian-schools-present-state-and-challenges.html|work=HUrights Osaka|accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights Mongolia indicated in December 2012 that while Mongolia “is currently experiencing a major resource boom and the country is on the brink of one of the most dramatic transformations in its history,” with the mining of mineral wealth and foreign investment “expected to triple the national economy by 2020,” the country “ranks disappointingly among the worse countries in the international human development index (110 out of 187 according to the 2011 Human Development Index).”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights|url=http://www.undp.mn/news071212a.html|work=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Among the serious human-rights problems that face Mongolia, especially within the police and security sector, are the abuse of prisoners by police, uneven law enforcement, poor prison conditions, arbitrary arrest, excessively long periods of pretrial detention, judicial corruption, lack of [[media independence]], government secrecy, domestic violence, and trafficking in persons. Discrimination “on the basis of ethnic origin, language, race, age, sex, social origin, or status” is forbidden, and there is official sexual equality “in political, economic, social, cultural fields, and family.”&lt;ref name="2010 Human Rights Report: Mongolia"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Mongolia|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eap/154394.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing attention has been paid recently to the human-rights impact of the rapid expansion of the mining industry in Mongolia, which in many cases has had a deleterious impact upon the environment of traditional herders and therefore upon their everyday lives and occupational prospects.

==Basic rights==

While there is freedom of speech and of the press, “insulting” is a crime, and the government attempts to pressure and silence the news media in various ways. Although censorship is illegal, many journalists engage in self-censorship out of fear of reprisal by the government or by their employers. Although Mongolian law guarantees a right to privacy, the government often intrudes into the privacy of its opponents, journalists, and others, by tapping phones and breaking into e-mail accounts.

In 2009, most of the television stations in Ulaanbaatar signed an “agreement” with the Media Office of the General Policy Authority in which they effectively submitted to a degree of government oversight over their content in return for “protection.” Newspapers have been fined for defamation of the government, and libel charges against and tax investigations of the news media are common. In libel cases, the burden of proof is on the defendant. Many journalists are corrupt, moreover, and will invent news stories in exchange for a payment.

Although the government does not restrict Internet access, it does monitor certain persons' e-mails. Academic freedom and cultural freedom are respected, as are the freedom of assembly and association. Mongolians are free to move within the country, travel abroad, move abroad and move back from abroad. Foreigners living in Mongolia must obtain exit visas in order to leave the country. Elections are relatively free and fair. There are 17 registered political parties, which are able to conduct their activities freely.

==Abolition of capital punishment==
On 14 January 2010, the country's President [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]] announced that he would, henceforth, systematically use his prerogative to pardon all people [[sentenced to death]]. He stated that [[Use of capital punishment by nation|most countries in the world had abolished the death penalty]], and Mongolia should follow their example. He suggested that the capital punishment would be commuted to a thirty-year prison sentence. The decision was controversial; when President Elbegdorj announced it in [[State Great Khural|Parliament]], [[Mongolian People's Party|MPRP]] represesentatives chose not to give the applause customarily due after a presidential speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le président mongol veut abolir la peine de mort|newspaper=Le Monde (in French)|place=Paris|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/asie-pacifique/article/2010/01/14/le-president-mongol-veut-abolir-la-peine-de-mort_1291441_3216.html|date=14 January 2009|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[Capital punishment in Mongolia]])

President Elbegdorj stated "Capital punishment is wrong–it degrades human dignity. It brings no peace to society. It does not deter crime and does not lift up mankind," in [http://www.unrol.org/files/Statement%20by%20Mongolia.pdf his speech] at the High-Level Meeting on the Rule of Law of the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement by H.E. Mr.Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President of Mongolia, at the United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the national and international levels|publisher=United Nations Rule of Law Unit|url=http://www.unrol.org/files/Statement%20by%20Mongolia.pdf|date=24 September 2012|accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "By ratifying the Second Optional Protocol Mongolia would add yet one more country in the world community to fully abolish the death penalty. Pardoning a life does not mean pardoning a penalty. The punishment for serious and cruel felonies must be severe, and must be just. However, I do not think it is just to deprive any citizens of life in the name of state. The right to life is one of the fundamental rights of a human being and cannot depend on anyone, not even on the head of state. The state should respect very fundamental human rights, and secure them by law," President Elbegdorj pointed out in [http://www.president.mn/eng/newsCenter/viewNews.php?newsId=249 his greeting] to the delegation of the 5th international meeting of Justice Ministers on 18 May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tsakhia|first=Elbegdorj|title=Greetings of the President of Mongolia Tsakhia to the delegates of the 5th international meeting of Ministers of Justice "From moratorium to abolition of the capital punishment-No justice without life"|publisher=Office of the President of Mongolia|url=http://www.president.mn/eng/newsCenter/viewNews.php?newsId=249|accessdate=21 June 2013|date=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four months after President Elbegdorj's announcement of moratorium of death penalty by his pardon, a survey was conducted among Mongolian legal academics asking whether it is right or wrong to abolish death penalty in Mongolia. 83% of the survey participants responded that it was wrong.

Despite much criticism from domestic conservative politicians, the opposition, and critics, President Elbegdorj's decision was positively received internationally. Amnesty International noted "President Elbegdorj's actions demonstrate commitment to the protection of human rights and set a good example for other Asian countries in the region," on 18 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abolish the death penalty in Mongolia|publisher=Amnesty International|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/appeals-for-action/abolish-death-penalty-mongolia|date=18 February 2010|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; International organization "Hands off Cain" awarded Elbegdorj with "Abolitionist of the Year 2011" noting Mongolia as an example that fosters the right to life among Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Abolitionist of the Year 2011' awarded to Mongolian President Elbegdorj|publisher=Hands off Cain|url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/news/index.php?iddocumento=15312549|date=17 October 2011|accessdate=29 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106034351/http://www.handsoffcain.info/news/index.php?iddocumento=15312549|archivedate=6 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in January 2012, Mongolian Parliament amended a law to join the 2nd Optional Protocol to the Convention on Civil and Political Rights; making Mongolia a state party to the convention and reinforcing the country's commitment to the abolition of capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mongolia takes 'vital step forward' in abolishing the death penalty|publisher=Amnesty International|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/mongolia-takes-vital-step-forward-abolishing-death-penalty-2012-01-05|accessdate=8 August 2012|date=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institutionalized corruption==
Corruption is a major problem throughout the Mongolian government and law enforcement, and there is insufficient oversight by either official agencies or the independent media. Also, the immunity of parliament members from prosecution encourages corruption and shields offenders from punishment.

Public debate of issues is inhibited by the fact that much government decision making takes place behind closed doors. There is no provision for the disclosure of government information to the public, and the State Secrets Law is strong and comprehensive.

"I sincerely believe that the true enemy of democracy and freedom is corruption... The worst theft is corruption which damages people's common rights and liberties...I am convinced that fighting corruption must be one of the most important duties of the Mongolian State today," President Elbegdorj noted in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elbegdorj Addresses Dystopic Mongolia |publisher=Investorvillage.com |url=http://investorvillage.com/mbthread.asp?mb=10163&amp;tid=11787547&amp;showall=1|accessdate=29 June 2013|date=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009 Elbegdorj replaced the Community Council of Independent Authority Against Corruption (IAAC) formed by former President [[Nambaryn Enkhbayar]] which included sports and music stars and supreme clergy while expressing his dissatisfaction with its investigation of petty corruption instead of political level corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Independent Authority Against Corruption and the President|url=http://news.gogo.mn/r/60592|accessdate=21 June 2013|publisher=gogo.mn (in Mongolian)|date=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then reorganized the council with professional lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New community council established by the president visited IAAC|publisher=Independent Authority Against Corruption of Mongolia|url=http://www.iaac.mn/index.php?coid=492&amp;cid=19|accessdate=21 June 2013|date=7 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040256/http://www.iaac.mn/index.php?coid=492&amp;cid=19|archivedate=6 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government corruption and the abuse of power by police have a deleterious effect on the right to engage freely in public debate. There have been several instances of police violence or arbitrary conduct in recent years involving opposition politicians, journalists, or protesters, among them:

* The abduction of D. Enkhbat from France in 2003. Allegedly, he was suspected to be involved in S. Zorig's assassination. Mongolia's Central Intelligence Agency abducted him from Le Havre in 2003, brought him to Berlin, where he was drugged and brought onto the regular MIAT plane to Ulaanbaatar. He was, however, not tried for being involved in the Zorig case. Instead, the authorities said they imprisoned Enkhbat because a health certificate that had led to a release from a previous sentence had been a forgery. Additionally, he and his lawyer L. Sanjaasüren were convicted of exposing state secrets in 2004. Enkhbat died on 22 April 2006. Ts.Nyamdorj (MPRP) was the Justice Minister in 2000-2008, 2008-2012. For his suspected role in D. Enkhbat's kidnapping, B.Khurts, who was a spy at the Central Intelligence Agency was arrested in the UK in late 2010. B.Khurts and three others of the Central Intelligence Agency were ordered and sent by then Prime Minister [[Nambaryn Enkhbayar]] (MPRP) to abduct D.Enkhbat from France. The Central Intelligence Agency is directly under the control of the Prime Minister. In 2010 B.Khurts was working as a high ranking National Security Council of Mongolia and on official visit to the UK then extradited to Germany in August 2011. Released next month, Khurts returned to Mongolia and became Deputy Chief of the Independent Authority Against Corruption in Mongolia.[&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12115411 BBC article]&lt;/ref&gt; Enkhbayar was convicted of and sentenced to two and a half year prison term by all of three level courts for graft, embezzlement, misappropriation of government properties, and misuse of his position in 2012.&lt;ref name="news.mn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.mn/content/143291.shtml|title=Enkhbayar's request to be freed from conviction returned|publisher=news.mn (in Mongolian)|accessdate=30 June 2013|date=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Enkhbayar was never tried for his ordering and sending a mission to abduct D.Enkhbat from France.  
* The detention of Member of Parliament Lamjaviin [[Gundalai]] (Democratic Party). In August 2003, the opposition MP L. Gundalai was detained from a flight to South Korea after a week-long conflict with then Justice Minister Ts. Nyamdorj (MPRP). Witnesses said that the police showed no arrest warrants or identity cards. A videotape of the incident allegedly showed Gundalai’s bodyguard, who was also arrested, being choked, and Gundalai's assistant was beaten. Gundalai was released on the next day.
* In May 2006, Eagle TV reporters Batdorj, Bayanbat, and News Director Orgil were confronted by police when they tried to film the teardown for the morning news{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} under MPRP Prime Ministership and Justice Minister Ts.Nyamdorj (MPRP). According to the TV station's Managing Director [[Tom Terry (author)|Tom Terry]], the police officer repeatedly smashed his fist into the camera, causing damage significant enough that it no longer works properly and will have to be sent for repair&lt;ref&gt;http://terrycom.net/blog/article.php?story=20060507233150708{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The deaths of five people shot dead by the police during the state of emergency called by President [[Nambaryn Enkhbayar]] (MPRP) and MPRP government led by [[Sanjaagiin Bayar]] (MPRP) and Justice Minister Tsendiin Munkh-Orgil (MPRP) following [[2008 riot in Mongolia|July 1st, 2008 riots]], whose exact circumstances remain unclear. Additionally, there were allegations of police brutality against people arrested in connection to the riots.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Women's rights==

Authorities do not interfere in the rights of families to make their own decisions about childbirth and upbringing. Most women have access to obstetric care, but there are widespread problems in regard to waiting times, confidentiality, and lack of professionality by health-care workers.

Many women are their families' main breadwinners. Mongolian law specifies that men and women should receive equal pay for doing the same work and enjoy the same access to education, although women are banned from certain jobs that involve physical labor or that are especially dangerous and women are allowed to retire at 55, five years earlier than men.

In principle, women have equal rights in divorce and are entitled to alimony, but husbands are often permitted to retain full control of family businesses after divorces. Divorce is not available to women who are pregnant or have a child under the age of one. (Article 12.2 of the Family Code 1999)  There is no official agency tasked exclusively with safeguarding women's rights, but there is a National Gender Center that is subordinate to the Prime Minister's Office as well as various other councils and committees that are concerned with women's issues. There are also active and outspoken women's rights organizations.&lt;ref name="2010 Human Rights Report: Mongolia"/&gt;

The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed concern in a 2008 report that “women bear a disproportionate burden of family responsibility in the context of the State policy on population growth which encourages larger families.”  The committee urged Mongolia “to intensify its efforts to eradicate traditional stereotypes regarding the roles and responsibilities of women and men in the family and society” and to promote “the equal sharing of domestic and family responsibilities, including the idea of joint parental responsibility between women and men.”

The committee also urged the “implementation of the Law on Fighting against Domestic Violence” and called on Mongolia “to ensure that all women who are victims of domestic violence, including rural women, have access to immediate means of redress and protection, including protection orders, access to safe shelters and medical and rehabilitation assistance in all parts of the country” and “to ensure that public officials, especially law enforcement personnel, the judiciary, health-care providers and social workers, are fully familiar with applicable legal provisions, and are sensitized to all forms of violence against women and adequately respond to them.” It also urged Mongolia to criminalize marital rape and to take action against the trafficking of women.

==Children's rights==

There is widespread violence against children and sexual abuse of them, particularly within families of the poor class, and it is often the case that authorities do not take these offenses seriously. Child prostitution is also common, and in some cases police officers are in cahoots with pimps and brothels. Some child prostitutes, instead of being helped by authorities, have been punished for prostitution. There are many orphans, and the abandonment of children is a major issue, with the law providing no deterrent to prevent this crime. Hundreds of children live on the street, and child shelters are substandard. Children residing at shelters are not sent to schools, and children without proper ID are refused treatment at hospitals. There exists a relatively new, privately funded program to provide schooling and play experiences for children in shelters but none that's funded or initiated by the government.

Mongolia is not a signatory of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.&lt;ref name="2010 Human Rights Report: Mongolia"/&gt; It is, however, a signatory of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and since 2003 has passed several laws in an effort to conform to the convention, among them the Law on Prevention from Iodine Deficiency by Salt Iodization, the Law on Prevention of HIV/AIDS, the Law on Breast Milk Substitutes, and Law on Monetary Assistance to the Child and Family, and has also amended the Law on Social Welfare, the Law on Education, and the Criminal Procedure Law to conform to the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Report|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/CRC-C-MNG-CO-3-4.pdf|work=United Nations|accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of [[child labor]] is also important in Mongolia. In fact, 13.8% of children aged 5 to 14 are working children according to a 2013 [[U.S. Department of Labor]]'s report. Almost 86% of these children are engaged in agricultural activities while others are exposed to the hazards of the [[Mining in Mongolia|mining industry]], digging for gold, coal and [[fluorspar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/mongolia.htm Mongolia, 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor]]&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2014, the Department's ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' indicated the ongoing use of child labor in these sectors.

==LGBT rights==
{{main|LGBT rights in Mongolia}}
Homosexuality is not explicitly outlawed, but there is a law against “immoral gratification of sexual desires.” The LGBT Center has charged the government with monitoring members' e-mail accounts.&lt;ref name="2010 Human Rights Report: Mongolia"/&gt; In 2009, Human Rights Watch called on Mongolia's minister of justice to “overturn a state agency's decision to deny the official registration request of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Center, a national nongovernmental organization,” noting that the “center cannot operate in the country without this registration.”  The agency's reason for rejecting the request was that the center's name “has a meaning that conflicts with Mongolian customs and traditions and has the potential to set the wrong example for youth and adolescents.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mongolia Rebuffs Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Organization|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/07/09/mongolia-rebuffs-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-organization|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employees' rights==

Employees have the right to unionize and strike, although this right is limited in the case of foreigners, government employees, workers without job contracts, and workers providing essential services. Pressure and harassment have been used to prevent the formation of unions or to inhibit union demonstrations, and a union leader was fired for leading a strike in 2010.  Collective bargaining is permitted. Forced labor is illegal, but occurs. Several hundred North Koreans who work in factories, mines, and other jobs through an arrangement with their government are not free to quit or complain about their jobs.

The law prohibits work by children under 14 and limits work by older children, but enforcement is highly ineffective, and many children are forced to work in construction and in mines. Because of abandonment by parents, many children are obliged to support themselves by working as animal herders or in other jobs. Child jockeys are also used in horse races.

There is a minimum wage, but it is low and many workers are paid less. There are also laws setting a maximum workweek and other limits. There are no laws governing sick leave. Enforcement of occupational health and safety laws is insufficient, and the conditions under which many foreigners work, chiefly North Korean and Chinese laborerers working in such fields as mining and construction, are below standard.&lt;ref name="2010 Human Rights Report: Mongolia"/&gt;

Human Rights Watch, citing a report that the Mongolian and North Korean governments had agreed to an arrangement by which up to 5300 North Koreans would work in Mongolia, called on Mongolia in 2008 to “protect the human and labor rights of North Koreans coming to Mongolia to work,”  Noting that North Koreans working abroad under such arrangements “face severe restrictions on their freedom of expression, movement, and association” and often remain “under virtually constant surveillance by North Korean 'minders,'” HRW asked Mongolian officials “to conduct thorough on-site investigations in facilities where North Koreans work, ensure that all North Korean workers are fully informed of their rights and how to exercise them, ensure that workers receive net wages compliant with minimum wage laws, and monitor freedom of movement of North Korean workers.”  An HRW official said: “This is a chance for the Mongolian government to set a positive precedent for North Koreans working overseas and allow them to be treated like other workers, instead of as virtual prisoners of North Korean minders. They must not waste it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mongolia: Protect Rights of North Korean Migrant Workers|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2008/08/19/mongolia-protect-rights-north-korean-migrant-workers|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=January 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of mining on human rights==

A report by the United Nations Human Rights Team Group in 2006 noted that while “Mongolia’s mining sector has become an important part of Mongolia’s economic development in the past ten years, this economic development has not been conducted in a manner consistent...with [Millennium] Goal 9 to 'strengthen human rights' in Mongolia.” Among its findings were that the destruction of pasture land and water resources as a result of mining has damaged conditions for herders and that they have not been provided with alternative opportunities for employment and the need to moves their herds further from former herding areas, and for longer periods, has caused them to lose access to education, health care, and social services.&lt;ref name="HUrights Osaka"/&gt;

The National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia held a three-day conference in Ulaanbaatar in October 2012 to study “the human rights impacts of the country’s booming mining sector.”  Government and industry representatives, plus members of international human-rights groups, 
discussed the fact that “many herders in mining areas have been forced to leave their traditional lands and find alternative means to support themselves” and “the impact of these changes on the human rights of herders, in particular, their right to live in a healthy and safe environment, property rights and the right to preserve one’s culture and traditions.” Also discussed was the fact that “conflict between mining companies and artisanal miners, civil society organisations and local people has been escalating in recent times, occasionally resulting in violence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promoting human rights in Mongolia's mining sector|url=http://www.asiapacificforum.net/news/promoting-human-rights-in-mongolias-mining-sector|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202132620/http://www.asiapacificforum.net/news/promoting-human-rights-in-mongolias-mining-sector|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 2, 2012|work=Asia Pacific Forum|accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Testimony by persons living in mining districts confirmed that the rapid development of mining has indeed had drastic impacts upon the environment and thus upon local residents' long-term health and survival prospects as well as their economic viability in non-mining occupations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mining and Human Rights in Mongolia: Gobi Herders speak out|url=http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=1442|work=The UB Post|accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of the UN Working Group on Human Rights and Business, during a visit to mining areas in Mongolia in 2012, observed “an unfortunate lack of clarity about the respective roles and responsibilities of the government and business with regard to human rights. In many mining communities, I heard residents’ expectations that hospitals and schools would be built in their soums by companies, without any mention of the government’s responsibility to do so. In other conversations, I heard of severe workplace accidents caused by companies unwilling to take safety precautions. These companies were not sanctioned for their actions, and remedies were not available for victims or their families.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mining and Human Rights in Mongolia: Gobi Herders speak out|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12674&amp;LangID=E|work=The UB Post|accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2012, the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development and its Mongolian member organization, the Centre for Human Rights and Development, investigated “the situation of human rights defenders...working on human rights violations in relation to mining activities in Mongolia.” The investigators found that herders living near mines “face numerous human rights violations, including the rights to live in a safe and secure environment; to access clean water; to choose and protect the source of their livelihood and income; to own property; to participate in decision-making concerning the mineral exploitation on their lands; to access justice and effective remedies; and to preserve their cultural heritage.” The investigators found that human rights defenders were subjected to threats, intimidation, judicial harassment, vilification, and smear campaigns; in their report the investigators noted that even they, though accompanied by local officials, “were harassed by a security guard” at mining site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mongolia Mining Issues|url=http://www.forum-asia.org/uploads/books/2012/december/FA-FFM-2012-Mongolia-HRDsWorkingonMiningIssues-ExecutiveSummary-FINAL.pdf|work=Forum - Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights of persons seeking asylum or refugee status==

Mongolia is not a signatory of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, but its constitution recognizes a right to asylum and the government gives refuge to persons persecuted in their home countries on account of race, religion, and various other attributes. However, refugees are treated officially as illegal migrants and do not have a right to receive medical care, to get an education, or to work. nor are they allowed to work. Such persons can apply for Mongolian citizenship, but the process often takes much longer than the maximum of six months that it is supposed to take according to the law.&lt;ref name="2010 Human Rights Report: Mongolia"/&gt;

==Rights of persons under arrest==

Although forbidden by law, arbitrary arrest occurs. Many Mongolians are unaware of their rights under the law when it comes to such matters. Abuse by police generally goes uninvestigated owing to inadequate resources or to the quashing of such efforts by police.  Moreover, while a court-issued warrant is a prerequisite for arrest under Mongolian law, most arrests are made without a warrant. Laws requiring court orders to hold subjects for more than three days and requiring authorities to inform suspects of the charges against them are generally followed.

There is a bail system. Defendants who cannot afford a lawyer are entitled to court-appointed representation, though many defendants are unaware of this right and are not told about it, while others do not avail themselves of this opportunity because they do not trust court-appointed lawyers to represent them fairly. Police frequently employ excessive violence while making arrests.&lt;ref name="2010 Human Rights Report: Mongolia"/&gt; A UNESCO report issued in 2005 noted that while Mongolia had sought in recent years to bring its legislation into line with international human rights standards,” it is still common for criminal suspects to undergo “torture and ill-treatment” and “perpetrators enjoy impunity”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia|url=http://www.mn-nhrc.org/eng/28/37/|work=Recommendations by UN treaty bodies|accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights of persons on trial==

Although Mongolian law prescribes an independent court system and the right to a fair trial by a judge, judicial corruption, including a susceptibility to bribery and inappropriate influence, is a growing problem, particularly at the Supreme Court level.  There are no jury trials; defendants technically have a right to interrogate witnesses, offer evidence, and file appeals, although many persons are convicted as a result of forced confessions.&lt;ref name="2010 Human Rights Report: Mongolia"/&gt; According to Amnesty International, lawyers and government officials describe Mongolian courts as corrupt and say that trials are often unfair, routinely using as evidence confession obtained through torture. Detention facilities do not make adequate provisions for confidential meetings between defendants and their attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report 2012|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/mongolia/report-2012#page|work=Amnesty International|accessdate=January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights of prisoners==

Conditions in prison and detention facilities are poor, although in recent years there have been efforts at improvement. Adults and children are often detained together. Abuse is common, as are overcrowding, poor ventilation, low hygienic standards, and inadequate medical care. Prisoners doing time don't get medical treatment, even under serious sickness or injuries. There are no law for this kind of human rights. Prisoners enjoy the right to worship, receive visitors, submit complaints.&lt;ref name="2010 Human Rights Report: Mongolia"/&gt; Critics like the UN's Special Rapporteur on torture, Manfred Novak, have repeatedly criticized Mongolia's prisons, and especially the conditions surrounding the death penalty, as cruel and inhuman. Fifty-nine different crimes, including acts of terrorism, genocide, rape, sabotage, and murder were punishable by the death penalty until 2012, though no executions took place after 2010, when the president imposed a moratorium.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mongolia takes ‘vital step forward’ in abolishing the death penalty|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/mongolia-takes-vital-step-forward-abolishing-death-penalty-2012-01-05|work=Amnesty International|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Another subject of criticism was the fact that the use of the death penalty was covered by the Law on State Secrets and the Law on the List of State Secrets, which means that statistics on executions were kept secret.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt;

'''Jimmy James''' [[Medal of the Order of Australia|OAM]] (1913–91)&lt;ref name="Holmes2003p66DOB"&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmes|2003|p=66}}. While Jimmy James' birthdate was not officially recorded, he claimed that he had been born in 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal Australian]] and member of the [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]] people, who was best known as an [[Aboriginal tracker]] who helped [[South Australia Police|South Australian Police]] in tracking criminals over a forty-year period.

Born near [[Ernabella]] (now Pukatja) in central Australia to his parents, Warlawurru and Kaarnka, he spent his late childhood at the [[Ooldea, South Australia|Ooldea Mission]]. He left the area in 1945, after being wrongfully arrested, and headed to the [[South Australia]]n [[Riverland]], where he assisted in the establishment of the [[Gerard (Aboriginal Council)|Gerard Mission]]. It was there that he married Lilian Disher in 1947.

'''Kharkhorin Rock''', also '''Kharkarin Rock''' or '''Phallic Rock''', is a large statue of a [[penis]] raised on a platform on the [[steppe]], located near [[Erdene Zuu Monastery]] (part of the World Heritage Site entitled [[Orkhon Valley Cultural Landscape]]) in [[Kharkhorin]], [[Övörkhangai Province]] of [[Mongolia]]. The phallic rock statue has dual functions; primarily it is a reminder to the monks to remain [[Celibacy|celibate]], but it is also a symbol of fertility and human life.{{sfn|Kohn|2008|p=123}}{{Sfn|Blunden|2008|pp=274, 402}} The {{convert|60|cm|adj=on}} long stone statue is located near Kharkhorin.{{sfn|Kohn|2008|p=123}}

==Legend==
Legend states that a monk who had vowed to be celibate had turned out to be a womanizer. As punishment he was castrated to remind him of his vows of celibacy. As a warning to the other inmate monks of the monastery, a rock in the shape of a penis was prominently engraved as a stone phallus called "Kharkhorin Rock" within walking distance from the monastery, to remind them that they should not be indulging in any sexual activity with the local women.{{Sfn|Blunden|2008|p=402}}&lt;ref name=tour&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legendtour.ru/eng/mongolia/regions/kharakhorum.shtml |title=Sights of Interest in Mongolia: Kharakhorum (Karakorum) |accessdate=27 November 2012 |publisher=Legendtour |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604140629/http://www.legendtour.ru/eng/mongolia/regions/kharakhorum.shtml |archivedate= 4 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
[[Lonely Planet]] says that the larger rock "points erotically to something interestingly called a 'vaginal slope'" which is hidden in a small valley, about {{convert|2|km}} to the southeast of Erdene Zuu Monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/mongolia/central-mongolia/kharkhorin-karakorum/sights/architecture/phallic-rock|title=Phallic Rock|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river flowing in this basaltic rocky area originates from the Gyatruu range to Kharkhorin soum.{{Sfn|Shagda|2004|p=94}} It is accessed from the main road by a well-used path. One can see the larger statue from the road from [[Ulanbatar]] road and {{convert|1|km}} from Karakhorin hill. Many visitors seek the opportunity to visit the rock, and many women also approach the site to seek blessings for a child to be born to them.{{Sfn|Blunden|2008|p=402}} The smaller, {{convert|24|in}} stone phallus is located within the grounds of the monastery itself, just to the northeast of the main monastery building.

There are also four rocks in the shape of [[turtle]]s (considered to be symbols of protection and eternity) marking the four [[cardinal direction]]s of the monastery's ancient boundary limits. The stones are inscribed with their past history on the back.&lt;ref name=tour/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2618">The '''Bamangwato''' (more correctly BagammaNgwato, also BaNgwato) can be said to be one of the eight "principal" [[Tswana people|Tswana]] chieftaincies of [[Botswana]], and just like any other Tswana chieftaincy in Botswana, constitutes a small percent in the central district even in their capital [[Serowe]]. They ruled over majority [[Bakalanga]], (the largest ethnic group in Central District) and others such as the [[Basarwa]], [[Birwa]] and [[Tswapong Hills|Tswapong]].  Modern Bamangwato formed in the [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]], with its main town and capital (after 1902) at Serowe. Its paramount chief, a hereditary position, occupies one of the fifteen places in [[Ntlo ya Dikgosi]], the national House of Chiefs.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The core patrilineage of the Bamangwato are an 18th-century offshoot of the [[Bakwena]] people, but members in the Ngwato kingdom came from many sources, as was the case with all of the major 19th-century African kingdoms.  [[Sir Seretse Khama]]'s paternal forebears, the chiefs of the Ngwato, had built several prior capitals including [[Shoshong]] and Phalatswe, also known as [[Palapye|Old Palapye]]. (Before the advent of colonial administration and fixed infrastructure, it was common for a town to move when the local environment degraded.)&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Neil  (25 Feb 1998) [http://www.thuto.org/ubh/bw/oldp.htm "The Abandonment of Phalatswe, 1901&amp;ndash;1916"], University of Botswana History Department, Retrieved 2 Jan 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Khama and the Protectorate administration created the modern borders of the Central District in Botswana.

The Sengwato language caused excitement in linguistic circles in 1998 when it was realized that it contained a unique f-s sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_1998_Oct_31/ai_53227243 "African dialect uses unexpected sound"] (31 Oct 1998) ''Science News'', Retrieved 3 Jan 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seretse Khama]], Botswana's first president, was of the Bamangwato, and his son, former President [[Ian Khama]], is the tribe's de facto paramount chief.

'''Margaret Mary "Peggy" Ray''' (1952 &amp;ndash; October 5, 1998) was an American woman who had [[schizophrenia]] and [[erotomania]]. She received much media attention for [[stalking]] American [[late night television]] [[talk show]] host [[David Letterman]] and retired astronaut [[Story Musgrave]].

==Early life==
Ray was second of four children born to George and Loretta Ray in Illinois. She attended [[Grayslake Central High School|Grayslake Community High]] in [[Grayslake, Illinois]] where she was a popular honor student. After graduating in 1970, Ray briefly enrolled in a [[nursing]] program at [[Marquette University]]. She dropped out during her sophomore year to marry her first husband, Gary Johanson, with whom she eventually had four children. When Ray was in her early 20s, she began showing signs of [[schizophrenia]]. Two of her brothers, Bill and David, also had schizophrenia which began manifesting when both were in their early 20s. Bill committed suicide by driving his car into a tree in 1973 while David died of intentional [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] in 1977. Ray's mother Loretta later admitted that George Ray (who died of a heart attack in the 1970s) was treated for schizophrenia before their marriage and was an alcoholic.&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gliatto|first=Tom|date=October 26, 1998|title=Fade to Black|journal=People|volume=50|issue=15|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20126599,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/22/nyregion/behind-jokes-life-pain-delusion-for-letterman-stalker-mental-illness-was-family.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Behind the Jokes, a Life Of Pain and Delusion; For Letterman Stalker, Mental Illness Was Family Curse and Scarring Legacy|last=Bruni|first=Frank|date=November 22, 1998|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1982, Ray's marriage to Gary Johanson had ended in divorce. Her mental health continued to decline and her ex-husband was awarded custody of their four children. Sometime after her divorce, Ray married for a second time and had a fifth child, Alex, in 1984. Ray's friends and family attempted to get her professional help but Ray refused and would frequently disappear for months at a time. Ray lived a [[Vagrants|transient]] life and would often hitchhike across the United States. When she was not living at the homes of various friends and family members, she would live in [[Shanty town|shanties]]. Around 1989, she relinquished custody of Alex to her mother.&lt;ref name="people" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="southeast"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&amp;dat=19981018&amp;id=IvJYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RscMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1169,7735149|title=Suicide on railroad track ends celebrity-stalker's inner agony|date=October 18, 1998|work=The Southeast Missourian|page=10C|accessdate=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stalking behavior==

===David Letterman===
Ray first made the news in May 1988, when she was arrested at the [[Lincoln Tunnel]] for failing to pay the $3 toll. She was driving late night talk show host [[David Letterman]]'s [[Porsche]], stolen from his driveway, with her three-year-old son Alex. She claimed she was Letterman’s wife and that her son was their child.&lt;ref name=seattle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19981006&amp;slug=2776109|title=Former Stalker Of Letterman And Astronaut Commits Suicide|date=October 6, 1998|publisher=seattletimes.nwsource.com|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next several years, she was arrested a total of eight times for [[trespassing]] on Letterman's property and other related counts. She claimed she left cookies and an empty [[Jack Daniel's]] bottle in the foyer of Letterman's [[Connecticut]] home. At one point, she was found sleeping near a tennis court on Letterman's property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/656097/Stalker-of-Letterman-Musgrave-kills-self.html?pg=all|title=Stalker of Letterman, Musgrave kills self|date=October 7, 1998|publisher=deseretnews.com|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray’s exploits became a staple of supermarket tabloids and Letterman himself publicly treated it as a joke. In 1993, before taking his [[Late Night with David Letterman|late-night show]] to [[CBS]], Letterman's "Top 10 things I have to do before I leave NBC" included, "Send change of address forms to that woman who breaks into my house."&lt;ref name="southeast" /&gt; Another quip occurred on Letterman's first show on CBS, where he joked that because of his being on the air an hour earlier every day, Ray was breaking into his house that much earlier than normal. However, in an interview with [[Barbara Walters]], Letterman noted he never mentioned Ray's name on the air, and said that he had great compassion for her, often declining to press criminal charges against her. "I wasn't comfortable with the humanity of that," he said.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

Ray eventually served a total of 34 months in jail and psychiatric hospitals for stalking Letterman.&lt;ref name=seattle /&gt; During her jail and hospital stays, Ray was prescribed antipsychotic drugs to treat her schizophrenia which improved her condition. She would stop taking them after her release because she did not like the physical side effects (weight gain and lethargy) and felt that she did not need the medication because she was not ill.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

===Story Musgrave===
After being released from jail in the early 1990s, Ray's attentions shifted to astronaut [[Story Musgrave]], to whom she wrote letters, made telephone calls, and sent packages. In 1994, she posed as a reporter and interviewed him at the [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].  In September 1997, she showed up at his home in [[Osceola County, Florida]].  She claimed she and Musgrave were writing a book together stating, "I love Dr. Musgrave. I would die for him. He is a man of integrity and intelligence." Ray eventually served time in a Florida jail for trespassing on Musgrave's property.&lt;ref name="southeast"/&gt;

==Post-prison life and suicide==
After her stint in jail, Ray was sent to a psychiatric hospital in Miami and prescribed [[Haloperidol|Haldol]], an antipsychotic drug. Her condition improved and she was released from the hospital in August 1998. Shortly after her release, Ray stopped taking Haldol. She settled in [[Hotchkiss, Colorado]], living on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] [[disability]] benefits and performing odd jobs.&lt;ref name="people" /&gt;

On October 5, she committed [[suicide]] by kneeling on the tracks of the [[Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad]] in front of an oncoming train. In a letter that she wrote to her mother before her death, Ray said, "I'm all traveled out. I chose a painless and instantaneous way to end my life in the valley I loved."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Ray's body was cremated and her family scattered her ashes in [[Needle Rock Natural Area]] near [[Crawford, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="people" /&gt; Letterman and Musgrave publicly expressed sympathy upon her death.&lt;ref name="southeast" /&gt;

A '''market economy''' is an [[economic system]] in which the decisions regarding [[investment]], [[production (economics)|production]], and [[distribution (economics)|distribution]] are guided by the [[price signal]]s created by the forces of [[supply and demand]]. The major characteristic of a market economy is the existence of factor markets that play a dominant role in the allocation of [[Capital good|capital]] and the [[factors of production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gregory and Stuart|first= Paul and Robert |title= Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, Seventh Edition |publisher=George Hoffman|year= 2004 |ISBN= 0-618-26181-8|page = 538|quote=Market Economy: Economy in which fundamentals of supply and demand provide signals regarding resource utilization.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Future of the Market: An Essay on the Regulation of Money and Nature After the Collapse of "Actually Existing Socialism|author=Altvater, E.|year=1993|publisher=Verso|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market economies range from minimally regulated "[[free market]]" and laissez-faire systems—where state activity is restricted to providing [[public good]]s and services and safeguarding private ownership&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comparative Economic Transformations: Mainland China, Hungary, the Soviet Union, and Taiwan|author=Yu-Shan Wu|year=1995|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=8|quote=In laissez-faire capitalism, the state restricts itself to providing public goods and services that the economy cannot generate by itself and to safeguarding private ownership and the smooth operation of the self-regulating market.}}&lt;/ref&gt;—to [[Economic interventionism|interventionist]] forms where the government plays an active role in correcting [[market failure]]s and promoting [[social welfare]]. State-directed or [[Dirigisme|dirigist]] economies are those where the state plays a directive role in guiding the overall development of the market through [[Industrial policy|industrial policies]] or [[indicative planning]]—which guides but does ''not'' substitute the market for [[economic planning]]—a form sometimes referred to as a [[mixed economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Future of the Market: An Essay on the Regulation of Money and Nature After the Collapse of "Actually Existing Socialism|author=Altvater, E.|year=1993|publisher=Verso|pages=237–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Irvin B. p 491. Macroeconomics for Today. West Publishing. p. 491&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Future of the Market: An Essay on the Regulation of Money and Nature After the Collapse of "Actually Existing Socialism|author=Altvater, E.|year=1993|publisher=Verso|pages=237–238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market economies are contrasted with [[planned economies]] where investment and production decisions are embodied in an integrated economy-wide economic plan by a single organizational body that owns and operates the economy’s [[means of production]].

==Characteristics==
=== Supply and demand ===
Market economies rely upon a price system to signal market actors to adjust production and investment. Price formation relies on the interaction of supply and demand to reach or approximate an equilibrium where unit price for a particular good or service is at a point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

Governments can intervene by establishing [[price ceiling]]s or price floors in specific markets (such as [[minimum wage]] laws in the labor market), or use [[fiscal policy]] to discourage certain consumer behavior or to address market externalities generated by certain transactions ([[Pigovian tax]]es). Different perspectives exist on the role of government in both regulating and guiding market economies and in addressing social inequalities produced by markets. Fundamentally a market economy requires that a price system affected by supply and demand exists as the primary mechanism for allocating resources irrespective of the level of regulation.

=== Property rights ===
For market economies to function efficiently, governments must establish clearly defined and enforceable [[property rights]] for assets and capital goods. However, property rights does not specifically mean private property rights, and market economies do not logically presuppose the existence of [[Private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. Market economies can and often do include various types of [[cooperatives]] or autonomous [[state-owned enterprise]]s that acquire [[capital goods]] and raw materials in [[capital markets]]. These enterprises utilize a market-determined free price system to allocate capital goods and labor.&lt;ref name="auburn.edu"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/market_economy | title=A Glossary of Political Economy Terms, Market economy | author=Paul M. Johnson | year=2005 | work= | publisher=Auburn University | accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are many variations of [[market socialism]] where the majority of capital assets are socially-owned with markets allocating resources between socially-owned firms. These models range from systems based on [[Worker cooperative|employee-owned enterprises]] based on [[Worker self-management|self-management]] to a combination of public ownership of the [[means of production]] with [[factor market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bock man|first= Johanna |title= Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism|publisher= Stanford University Press|year= 2011|month= |ISBN= 978-0-8047-7566-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capitalism ==
{{main|Capitalism}}
{{Capitalism |Related}}

Capitalism generally refers to an economic system where the [[means of production]] are largely or entirely [[Private property|privately owned and operated]] for a profit, structured on the process of [[capital accumulation]]. In general, in capitalist systems investment, distribution, income, and prices are determined by markets, whether regulated or unregulated.

There are different variations of capitalism with different relationships to markets. In [[Laissez-faire]] and [[free market]] variations of capitalism, markets are utilized most extensively with minimal or no state intervention and minimal or no regulation over prices and the supply of goods and services. In [[Economic interventionism|interventionist]], [[welfare capitalism]] and mixed economies, markets continue to play a dominant role but are regulated to some extent by government in order to correct [[market failure]]s or to promote social welfare. In [[state capitalist]] systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on either [[Indicative planning|indirect economic planning]] and/or [[State enterprise|state-owned enterprises]] to accumulate capital.

Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of [[feudalism]], but most feel{{Who|date=June 2012}} that the term "mixed economies" more precisely describes most contemporary economies, due to their containing both private-owned and state-owned enterprises. In capitalism, prices determine the demand-supply scale. For example, higher demand for certain goods and services lead to higher prices and lower demand for certain goods lead to lower prices.

===Laissez-faire===
{{main|Laissez-faire|Economic liberalism}}
Laissez-faire is synonymous with what was referred to as strict [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[free market]] economy during the early and mid-19th century{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} as a [[classical liberal]] ([[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]]) ideal to achieve. It is generally understood that the necessary components for the functioning of an idealized free market include the complete absence of government regulation, subsidies, artificial price pressures, and government-granted monopolies (usually classified as [[coercive monopoly]] by free market advocates) and no taxes or tariffs other than what is necessary for the government to provide protection from coercion and theft, maintaining peace and property rights, and providing for basic public goods. Right-libertarian advocates of [[anarcho-capitalism]] see the state as morally [[illegitimate]] and economically unnecessary and destructive.

===Free-market economy===
{{See also|Free market}}
Free-market economy refers to an economic system where prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy. It typically entails support for highly competitive markets, private ownership of productive enterprises. ''Laissez-faire'' is a more extensive form of free-market economy where the role of the state is limited to protecting [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]].

===Welfare capitalism===
{{Main|Welfare capitalism}}
Welfare capitalism refers to a capitalist economy that includes public policies favoring extensive provisions for social welfare services. The economic mechanism involves a free market and the predominance of privately owned enterprises in the economy, but public provision of universal welfare services aimed at enhancing individual autonomy and maximizing equality. Examples of contemporary welfare capitalism include the [[Nordic model]] of capitalism predominant in Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/Sweden%20Paper.pdf |title=The surprising ingredients of Swedish success - free markets and social cohesion |date=June 25, 2013 |publisher=''[[Institute of Economic Affairs]]'' |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional models===

====Anglo-Saxon model====
{{main|Anglo-Saxon economy}}
Anglo-Saxon capitalism refers to the form of capitalism predominant in Anglophone countries and typified by the [[economy of the United States]]. It is contrasted with European models of capitalism such as the continental ''[[Social market]]'' model and the ''[[Nordic model]]''. Anglo-Saxon capitalism refers to a macroeconomic policy regime and capital market structure common to the Anglophone economies. Among these characteristics are low rates of taxation, more open [[financial market]]s, lower labor market protections, and a less generous [[welfare state]] eschewing [[collective bargaining]] schemes found in the continental and northern European models of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;''Anglo-Saxon capitalism'', Business Dictionary on BusinessDictionary.com: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/Anglo-Saxon-capitalism.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====East Asian model====
{{main|East Asian model of capitalism}}
The East Asian model of capitalism involves a strong role for state investment, and in some instances involves state-owned enterprises. The state takes an active role in promoting economic development through subsidies, the facilitation of "national champions", and an export-based model of growth. The actual practice of this model varies by country. This designation has been applied to the economies of Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and the People's Republic of China.

A related concept in political science is the [[developmental state]].

====Social market economy====
{{main|Social market economy}}
This model was implemented by [[Alfred Müller-Armack]] and [[Ludwig Erhard]] after [[World War II]] in [[West Germany]]. The social market economic model (sometimes called "Rhine capitalism") is based upon the idea of realizing the benefits of a free market economy, especially economic performance and high supply of goods, while avoiding disadvantages such as [[market failure]], destructive competition, concentration of economic power and the socially harmful effects of market processes. The aim of the social market economy is to realize greatest prosperity combined with best possible social security. One difference from the free market economy is that the state is not passive, but takes active [[Regulation|regulatory]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpb.de/popup/popup_lemmata.html?guid=Y0VZ7J keyword "social market economy" = “Soziale Marktwirtschaft”] Duden Wirtschaft von A bis Z. Grundlagenwissen für Schule und Studium, Beruf und Alltag. 2. Aufl. Mannheim: Bibliographisches Institut &amp; F.A. Brockhaus 2004. Lizenzausgabe Bonn: Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The social policy objectives include employment, housing and education policies, as well as a socio-politically motivated balancing of the distribution of income growth. Characteristics of social market economies are a strong [[competition policy]] and a [[contractionary monetary policy]]. The philosophical background is [[Neoliberalism]] or [[Ordoliberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Duden]] Wirtschaft von A bis Z: [http://www.bpb.de/nachschlagen/lexika/lexikon-der-wirtschaft/20642/soziale-marktwirtschaft Eintrag: keyword "social market economy" = Soziale Marktwirtschaft]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market socialism ==
{{main|Market socialism}}
{{Socialism sidebar |Models}}

Market socialism is a form of market economy where the means of production are [[Social ownership|socially-owned]]. In a market socialist economy, firms operate according to the rules of supply and demand and operate to maximize profit; the principal difference between market socialism and capitalism being that the profits accrue to society as a whole as opposed to private owners.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}. (p. 142): "It is an economic system that combines social ownership of capital with market allocation of capital...The state owns the means of production, and returns accrue to society at large."&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinguishing feature between non-market socialism and market socialism is the existence of a market for [[factors of production]] and the criteria of profitability for enterprises. Profits derived from publicly owned enterprises can variously be used to reinvest in further production, to directly finance government and social services, or be distributed to the public at large through a [[social dividend]] or [[basic income]] system.&lt;ref name="Social Dividend versus Basic Income Guarantee in Market Socialism, 2004"&gt;''Social Dividend versus Basic Income Guarantee in Market Socialism'', by Marangos, John. 2004. International Journal of Political Economy, vol. 34, no. 3, Fall 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Models of market socialism ===
Market socialism traces its roots to [[classical economics]] and the works of [[Adam Smith]], the [[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialists]], and [[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualist]] philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McNally|first= David |title= Against the Market: Political economy, market socialism and the Marxist critique |publisher= Verso|year= 1993|month= |isbn= 978-0-86091-606-2|page = 44|quote=...by the 1820s, 'Smithian' apologists for industrial capitalism confronted 'Smithian' socialists in a vigorous, and often venomous, debate over political economy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s the economists [[Oskar Lange]] and [[Abba Lerner]] developed a model of socialism that posited that a public body (dubbed the "Central Planning Board") could set prices through a trial-and-error approach until they equaled the [[marginal cost]] of production in order to achieve [[perfect competition]] and [[pareto optimality]]. In this model of socialism, firms would be state-owned and managed by their employees, and the profits would be disbursed among the population in a social dividend. This model came to be referred to as "market socialism" because it involved the use of money, a [[price system]], and simulated capital markets; all of which were absent from traditional of non-market socialism.

A more contemporary model of market socialism is that put forth by the American economist [[John Roemer]], referred to as ''[[Economic democracy]]''. In this model, [[social ownership]] is achieved through public ownership of equity in a market economy. A Bureau of Public Ownership (BPO) would own controlling shares in publicly listed firms, so that the profits generated would be used for public finance and the provision of a basic income.

[[Libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]] and left-anarchists often promote a form of market socialism in which enterprises are owned and managed cooperatively by their workforce so that the profits directly remunerate the employee-owners. These cooperative enterprises would compete with each other in the same way private companies compete with each other in a capitalist market. The first major elaboration of this type of market socialism was made by [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]] and was called "[[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]".

Self-managed market socialism was promoted in Yugoslavia by economists [[Branko Horvat]] and [[Jaroslav Vanek]]. In the self-managed model of socialism, firms would be directly owned by their employees and the management board would be elected by employees. These cooperative firms would compete with each other in a market for both capital goods and for selling consumer goods.

=== Socialist market economy ===
Following the 1978 reforms, the [[People's Republic of China]] developed what it calls a "[[socialist market economy]]", in which most of the economy is under state ownership, with the state enterprises organized as joint-stock companies with various government agencies owning controlling shares through a shareholder system. Prices are set by a largely free-price system and the state-owned enterprises are not subjected to micromanagement by a government planning agency. A similar system called "[[socialist-oriented market economy]]" has emerged in [[Vietnam]] following the [[Đổi Mới]] reforms in 1986. This system is frequently characterized as "[[state capitalism]]" instead of market socialism because there is no meaningful degree of employee self-management in firms, because the state enterprises retain their profits instead of distributing them to the workforce or government, and because many function as de facto private enterprises. The profits neither finance a social dividend to benefit the population at large, nor do they accrue to their employees.

In the People's Republic of China, this economic model is presented as a "[[Primary stage of socialism|preliminary stage of socialism]]" to explain the dominance of capitalistic management practices and forms of enterprise organization in both the state and non-state sectors.

==In Religion==
A wide range of philosophers and theologians have linked market economies to monotheistic values.  [[Michael Novak]] described capitalism as being closely related to Catholicism.  But, [[Max Weber]] drew a connection between capitalism and [[Protestantism]].  The Economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] has stated that his work was inspired by the healing characteristics of Judaism.  Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks of the [[United Synagogue]] draws a correlation between modern capitalism and the Jewish image of the [[Golden Calf]].&lt;ref&gt;Lord Sacks, [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/chief-rabbi-lord-sacks/religious-values-market-economy_b_1144469.html "Rediscovering Religious Values in the Market Economy"], ''HuffPost'', February 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
In the Christian faith, the [[Liberation theology]] movement advocated involving the church in labor market capitalism.  Many priests and nuns integrated themselves into labor organizations.  Others moved into the slums to live among the poor.  The [[holy trinity]] was interpreted as a call for social equality and the elimination of poverty.  The Pope was highly active in his criticism of Liberation Theology.  He was particularly concerned about the increased fusion between Christianity and Marxism.  He closed Catholic institutions that taught Liberation Theology.  He also dismissed some of its activists from the church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/liberationtheology.shtml "Liberation theology"], ''BBC'', July 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
The Buddhist approach to the market economy was dealt with in E.F. Schumacher’s 1966 essay, “Buddhist Economics,”.  Schumacher asserted that a market economy guided by Buddhist principles would more successfully meet the needs of its people. He emphasized the importance or pursuing occupations that adhered to Buddhist teachings.  The essay would later become required reading for a course that Clair Brown offered at [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Maclay, [http://news.berkeley.edu/2014/03/13/buddhist-economics-oxymoron-or-idea-whose-time-has-come/ "Buddhist economics: oxymoron or idea whose time has come?"], ''Berkeley News'', March 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
The economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues that markets suffer from informational inefficiency and the presumed efficiency of markets stems from the faulty assumptions of [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] welfare economics, particularly the assumption of perfect and costless information, and related incentive problems. Neoclassical economics assumes static equilibrium, and efficient markets require that there be no non-[[Convexity (finance)|convexities]], even though nonconvexities are pervasive in modern economies. Stiglitz's critique applies to both existing models of capitalism and to hypothetical models of market socialism. However, Stiglitz does not advocate replacing markets, but states that there is a significant role for [[Economic interventionism|government intervention]] to boost the efficiency of markets and to address the pervasive market failures that exist in contemporary economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Michie|first= Jonathan | authorlink = Jonathan Michie|title= Reader’s Guide to the Social Sciences |publisher= Routledge|date=January 1, 2001|isbn= 978-1579580919|page =1012  |quote=Stiglitz criticizes the first and second welfare theorems for being based on the assumptions of complete markets (including a full set of futures and risk markets) and perfect and costless information, which are simply not true. Incentives are dubious too. Thus, capitalist markets are also not efficient and there is some role for government intervention. The ability to decentralize using the price system requires that there be no nonconvexities, but nonconvexities are pervasive.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fair Market Economy is in fact a [[Martingale (probability theory)|Martingale]] or a [[Brownian motion]] model and for a participant competitor in such a model there is no more than 50% of success chances at any given moment. Due to the [[fractal]] nature of any fair market and being market participants subject to the law of [[competition]], which impose reinvesting an increasing part of profits, the mean statistical chance of bankruptcy within the [[Half-life|half life]] of any participant is also 50% &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Podobnik|first=Boris|last2=Horvatic|first2=Davor|last3=Petersen|first3=Alexander M.|last4=Urošević|first4=Branko|last5=Stanley|first5=H.

[[Robin Hahnel]] and [[Michael Albert]] claim that "markets inherently produce class division."&lt;ref name='Comparison'/&gt; Albert states that even if everyone started out with a [[balanced job complex]] (doing a mix of roles of varying creativity, responsibility and empowerment) in a market economy, class divisions would arise.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Without taking the argument that far, it is evident that in a market system with uneven distribution of empowering work, such as Economic Democracy, some workers will be more able than others to capture the benefits of economic gain. For example, if one worker designs cars and another builds them, the designer will use his cognitive skills more frequently than the builder. In the long term, the designer will become more adept at conceptual work than the builder, giving the former greater bargaining power in a firm over the distribution of income. A conceptual worker who is not satisfied with his income can threaten to work for a company that will pay him more. The effect is a class division between conceptual and manual laborers, and ultimately managers and workers, and a de facto labor market for conceptual workers.&lt;ref name='Comparison'&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam |last=Weiss |coauthors= |title=A Comparison of Economic Democracy and Participatory Economics |date=2005-05-04 |publisher= |url=http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/6345 |work=[[ZMag]] |pages= |accessdate=2008-06-26 |language= }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David McNally (professor)|David McNally]] arguing in the [[Marxist]] tradition that the logic of the market inherently produces inequitable outcomes and leads to unequal exchanges, arguing that [[Adam Smith]]'s moral intent and moral philosophy espousing equal exchange was undermined by the practice of the free markets he championed. The development of the market economy involved coercion, exploitation and violence that Adam Smith's moral philosophy could not countenance. McNally also criticizes market socialists for believing in the possibility of "fair" markets based on equal exchanges to be achieved by purging "parasitical" elements from the market economy, such as private ownership of the means of production. McNally argues that market socialism is an oxymoron when socialism is defined as an end to [[Wage labor|wage-based labor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McNally|first= David |title= Against the Market: Political economy, market socialism and the Marxist critique |publisher= Verso|year= 1993|month= |isbn= 978-0-86091-606-2|page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical background ===
Neither [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] nor [[Latin]] had a word corresponding to modern-day "family". The Latin ''familia'' must be translated to "household" rather than "family".&lt;ref&gt;Herlihy, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] household of [[ancient Rome]] was similar to that of medieval [[Europe]], in that it consisted &amp;ndash; in addition to the ''[[Pater familias|paterfamilias]]'', his wife and children &amp;ndash; of a number of [[Patronage in ancient Rome|clients ''(clientes)'']], or dependents of the lord who would attend upon him, counsel him and receive rewards. Where it differed from its medieval equivalent was in the use of [[Slavery|slaves]] rather than paid servants for the performance of menial tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Paul, Phillippe Ariès, Georges Duby, and Arthur Goldhammer | last = Veyne | title = A History of Private Life, Volume I, From Pagan Rome to Byzantium | edition = | publisher = Belknap Press | location =  | year = 1992 | pages = 38–9 | isbn=0-674-39974-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another difference was that, due to the relative security and peacefulness within the borders of the [[Roman Empire]], there was little need for [[fortification]]. The aristocratic household of medieval Europe, on the other hand, was as much a military as a socio-economic unit, and from the 9th century onwards the ideal residence was the [[castle]].&lt;ref name="Morris14"&gt;Morris, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Timothy (ed.) | last = Reuter | authorlink = Timothy Reuter | title = The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume III c.900-c.1024 | edition =  | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2000 | page = 47 | isbn=0-521-36447-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composition ===
As a result of the military nature of the medieval noble household, its composition was predominately male. Towards the end of the medieval period the ratio levelled out somewhat, but at an earlier date the feminine element of the household consisted only of the lady and her daughters, their attendants, and perhaps a few domestics to perform particular tasks such as washing.&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, pp. 34-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the male servants were purely military personnel; there would be a gatekeeper, as well as various numbers of [[knight]]s and [[esquire]]s to garrison the castle as a military unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Joseph &amp; Frances | last = Gies | authorlink = Frances and Joseph Gies | title = Life in a Medieval Castle | edition = 3rd | publisher = Harper Perennial | location = New York, Toronto | year = 1979 | page = 95 | isbn=0-06-090674-X | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, pp. 103-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet many of these would also serve other functions, and there would be servants entirely devoted to domestic tasks. At the lower level, these were simply local men recruited from the localities. The higher level positions &amp;ndash; in particular those attending on the lord &amp;ndash; were often filled by men of rank: sons of the lord's relatives, or his [[Retinue|retainers]].&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, pp. 36-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of servants of noble birth imposed a [[social hierarchy]] on the household that went parallel to the hierarchy dictated by function.&lt;ref name="Woolgar18-9"&gt;Woolgar, p. 18-9.&lt;/ref&gt; This second hierarchy had at its top the [[steward (office)|steward]] (alternatively ''[[seneschal]]'' or ''[[majordomo]]''), who had the overriding responsibility for the domestic affairs of the household.&lt;ref name="Woolgar17"&gt;Woolgar, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking care of the personal wellbeing of the lord and his family were the [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]], who was responsible for the chamber or private living-quarters, and the Master of the [[Wardrobe (government)|Wardrobe]], who had the main responsibility for clothing and other domestic items.&lt;ref name="Woolgar17" /&gt; 

Of roughly equal authority as the steward was the [[marshal]]. This officer had the militarily vital responsibility for the stables and horses of the household (the "marshalsea"), and was also in charge of discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, pp. 42-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The marshal, and other higher-ranking servants, would have assistants helping them perform their tasks. These &amp;ndash; called [[valet de chambre|valets de chambre]], [[Groom (horses)|groom]]s or [[page (servant)|page]]s, ranking from top to bottom in that order &amp;ndash; were most often young boys,&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, pp. 31-2.&lt;/ref&gt; although in the larger royal courts the valet de chambres included both young noble courtiers, and often artists, musicians and other specialists who might be of international repute. Assigning these the office of valet was a way of regularising their position within the household.

One of the most important functions of the medieval household was the procuration, storage and preparation of food. This consisted both in feeding the occupants of the residence on a daily basis, and in preparing larger feasts for guests, to maintain the status of the lord. The [[Kitchen#Middle Ages|kitchen]] was divided into a [[pantry]] (for [[bread]], [[cheese]] and [[napery]]) and a [[Buttery (shop)|buttery]] (for [[wine]], [[ale]] and [[beer]]). These offices were headed by a pantler and a butler respectively.&lt;ref name="Woolgar18-9" /&gt; Depending on the size and wealth of the household, these offices would then be subdivided further. The following is a list of some of the offices one could expect to find in a large medieval aristocratic or royal household:

In addition to these offices there was a need for [[servants]] to take care of the [[Medieval hunting|hunting]] animals. The master huntsman, or the ''[[veneur]]'', held a central position in greater noble households.&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, pp. 175-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the master [[Falconry|falconer]] was a high-ranking officer, often of noble birth himself.&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, pp. 217-8.&lt;/ref&gt; There were spiritual needs to be cared for, and a [[chapel]] was a natural part of every large household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Christopher (ed.) | last = Allmand | authorlink = Christopher Allmand | title = The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume VII c.1415-c.1500 | edition =  | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1998 | page = 324 | isbn=0-521-38296-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These household chapels would be staffed by varying numbers of [[cleric]]s. The [[chaplain]]s, [[confessor]]s and [[almoner]]s could serve in administrative capacities as well as the religious ones.&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, 176-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Noble households ===
{{main|Noble court}}
The households of medieval kings were in many ways simply aristocratic households on a larger scale: as the Burgundian court chronicler [[Georges Chastellain]] observed of the splendidly ordered court of the [[dukes of Burgundy]], "after the deeds and exploits of war, which are claims to glory, the household is the first thing that strikes the eye, and which it is, therefore, most necessary to conduct and arrange well."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Johan Huizinga, ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', 1924:31.&lt;/ref&gt; In some ways though, they were essentially different. One major difference was the way in which royal household officials were largely responsible for the [[governance]] of the realm, as well as the administration of the household.&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 11th century [[House of Capet|Capetian]] kings of France, for instance, "ruled through royal officers who were in many respects indistinguishable from their household officers."&lt;ref name="NCMH4(2),127-8"&gt;{{cite book | first = David and [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] (eds.) | last = Luscombe | title = The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume IV c.1024-c.1198 (part 2) | edition = | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2004 | pages = 127–8 | isbn=0-521-41411-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These officers &amp;ndash; primarily the [[seneschal]], [[constable]], [[butler]], [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] and [[chancellor]]&lt;ref name="NCMH4(2),127-8" /&gt; &amp;ndash; would naturally gain extensive powers, and could exploit this power for social advancement. One example of this is the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]]s of France, who rose from the position of royal stewards &amp;ndash; the [[Mayor of the Palace|Mayors of the Palace]] &amp;ndash; to become kings in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the father of [[Charlemagne]], [[Pepin the Short]], who gained control of government from the enfeebled [[Merovingian]] king [[Childeric III]].{{Ref label|A|a|none}} Another example can be found in the royal [[House of Stuart]] in [[Scotland]], whose family name bore witness to their background of service.&lt;ref&gt;Allmand, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the central positions of the royal household became little else than honorary titles bestowed upon the greatest families, and not necessarily even dependent on attendance at court. In [[Flanders]], by the thirteenth century, the offices of constable, butler, steward and chamberlain had become the hereditary right of certain high noble families, and held no political significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = David (ed.) | last = Abulafia | authorlink = David Abulafia | title = The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume V c.1198-c.1300 | edition = | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1999 | page = 408 | isbn=0-521-36289-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the royal household differed from most noble households in the size of their military element. If a king was able to muster a substantial force of household knights, this would reduce his dependence on the military service of his subjects. This was the case with [[Richard II of England]], whose one-sided dependence on his household knights &amp;ndash; mostly recruited from the county of [[Cheshire]] &amp;ndash; made him unpopular with his nobility and eventually contributed to his downfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Nigel | last = Saul | authorlink = Nigel Saul | title = Richard II | edition =  | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven and London | year = 1999 | pages = 444–5. | isbn=0-300-07875-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the semi-royal household of [[Edward II of England|Edward of Carnarvon]], later Edward II when Prince of Wales, is the earliest for which detailed knowledge can be obtained from sources.&lt;ref&gt;According to May McKisack, ''The Fourteenth Century'' (Oxford History of England)n1959:1, note references.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Itineration ===
The medieval aristocratic household was not fixed to one location, but could be more or less permanently on the move. Greater nobles would have [[Estate (law)|estate]]s scattered over large geographical areas, and to maintain proper control of all their possessions it was important to physically inspect the localities on a regular basis. As the master of the horses, travel was the responsibility of the [[marshal]]. Everything in the noble household was designed for travel, so that the lord could enjoy the same luxury wherever he went.&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly for kings, itineration was a vital part of [[governance]], and in many cases kings would rely on the hospitality of their subjects for maintenance while on the road. This could be a costly affair for the localities visited; there was not only the large royal household to cater for, but also the entire royal administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Christopher | last = Daniell | title = From Norman Conquest to Magna Carta: England, 1066-1215 | edition = | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn=0-415-22215-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only towards the end of the medieval period, when means of communication improved, that households, both noble and royal, became more permanently attached to one residence.&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional variations ===
[[File:Palace of Porphyrogenitus 2007 016.jpg|thumb|300px|The ruins of the Byzantine [[Palace of the Porphyrogenitus]] in [[Istanbul]].]]

The aristocratic society centered on the castle originated, as much of medieval culture in general, in [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] [[France]], and from there spread over most of [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="Morris14" /&gt; In other parts of Europe, the situation was different. On the northern and western fringes of the continent, society was kin-based rather than [[Feudalism|feudal]], and households were organised correspondingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = R.R. | last = Davies | authorlink = Rees Davies | title = The First English Empire: Power and Identities in the British Isles 1093-1343 | edition = | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 2000 | pages = 66–7 | isbn=0-19-820849-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Ireland]], the basis for social organisation was the "[[sept]]", a [[clan]] that could comprise as many as 250 households, or 1250 individuals, all somehow related.&lt;ref&gt;Herlihy, pp. 32-4.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Viking Age|Viking-age]] [[Scandinavia]], housing arrangements were more humble than those of contemporary France or [[England]], but also here the greater lords would own grand halls wherein they might entertain large numbers of guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Else | last = Roesdahl | title = The Vikings | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | location = London | year = 1998 | pages = 41–5 | isbn=0-14-025282-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Byzantine Empire]], slaves were employed until the end of the Empire, as were [[eunuch]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hussey, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of the living arrangements of the Byzantines, as very few buildings remain. From historical and architectural evidence it is known that, even though castles were rare, the wealthy lived in palaces of varying magnitude, with chapels and gardens, and rich decorations of [[mosaic]]s and [[fresco]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Hussey, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common households ==

=== Rural ===
The households of medieval peasant families were naturally smaller than those of the aristocracy, and as such resembled modern households more. The patterns of marriage fluctuated greatly over the course of the Middle Ages. Even though most of the available evidence concerns the higher classes, and the source material for [[southern Europe]] is richer than for the rest, it is still possible to make some rough generalisations.&lt;ref&gt;Herlihy, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems clear that the average age of marriage during the [[Early Middle Ages]] was [[Western European marriage pattern|comparatively high]], in the early twenties, and quite equal for men and women. The reason for this can be found in traditions brought forward from the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes, but equally in the fact that habitation was confined to small areas, a factor that enforced restrictions on population growth.&lt;ref&gt;Herlihy, pp. 77-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanawalt, Barbara. 1988. ''The Ties That Bound: Peasant Families in Medieval England''. Oxford University Press. pp. 95-100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, Bruce Wilson. 2009. ''Family life in the Age of Shakespeare''. Greenwood Press. pp. 21&lt;/ref&gt; 

As more land was won for cultivation, this trend changed. During the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]], women were increasingly married away in their teens, leading to higher [[birth rate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Herlihy, pp. 103-7.&lt;/ref&gt; While women would be married once they reached [[Reproduction|reproductive]] age, men had to possess independent means of sustenance &amp;ndash; to be able to provide for a family &amp;ndash; before entering into marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Horrox &amp; Ormrod, pp. 422-3.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the average age of marriage for men remained high, in the mid- to late twenties.&lt;ref&gt;Herlihy, pp. 107-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though peasant households were significantly smaller than aristocratic ones, the wealthiest of these would also employ servants.&lt;ref name="Hollister, p. 169"&gt;Hollister, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Service was a natural part of the cycle of life, and it was common for young people to spend some years away from home in the service of another household.&lt;ref name="H&amp;O420-1"&gt;Horrox &amp; Ormrod, pp. 420-1.&lt;/ref&gt; This way they would learn the skills needed later in life, and at the same time earn a wage. This was particularly useful for girls, who could put the earnings towards their dowry.&lt;ref&gt;Herlihy, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

The houses of medieval peasants were of poor quality compared to modern houses. The floor was normally of earth, and there was very little ventilation or sources of light in the form of windows. In addition to the human inhabitants, a number of livestock animals would also reside in the house.&lt;ref name="Hollister, p. 169"/&gt; Towards the end of the medieval period, however, conditions generally improved. Peasant houses became larger in size, and it became more common to have two rooms, and even a second floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Jacqueline (ed.) | last = Murray | authorlink =  | title = Love, Marriage, and Family in the Middle Ages: A Reader | edition = | publisher = Broadview | location = Peterborough, Ontario | year = 2001 | page = 387 | isbn=1-55111-104-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban ===
The medieval world was a much less urban society than either the Roman Empire or the modern world. The fall of the Roman Empire had caused a catastrophic de-population of the towns and cities that had existed within the Empire. Between the 10th and 12th centuries, however, a revival of the European city occurred, with an increase in the [[Urbanization|urbanisation]] of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Carlo M. | last = Cipolla | authorlink = Carlo Maria Cipolla | title = Before the Industrial Revolution: European Society and Economy, 1000-1700 | edition = 3rd | publisher = Routledge | location = London, New York | year = 1993 | page = 91 | isbn=0-415-09005-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of sending children away to act as servants was even more common in towns than in the countryside.&lt;ref name="H&amp;O420-1" /&gt; The inhabitants of towns largely made their livelihood as [[merchant]]s or [[artisan]]s, and this activity was strictly controlled by [[guild]]s. The members of these guilds would in turn employ young people &amp;ndash; primarily boys &amp;ndash; as [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]]s, to learn the craft and later take a position as guild members themselves.{{Ref label|B|b|none}} These apprentices made up part of the household &amp;ndash; or "family" &amp;ndash; as much as the children of the master.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, pp. 179-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later perspectives ==
[[File:More famB 1280x-g0.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Thomas More]] with his immediate family &amp;ndash; painted by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]] &amp;ndash; presenting an ideal image of the early modern family man]]

Towards the end of the Middle Ages, the functions and composition of households started to change. This was due primarily to two factors. First of all, the introduction of [[gunpowder]] to the field of warfare rendered the castle a less effective defence, and did away with the military function of the household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Philippe | last = Contamine | authorlink =  | title = War in the Middle Ages | edition =  | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford | year = 1984 | pages = 200–7 | isbn=0-631-13142-6 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a household more focused on comfort and luxury, and with a significantly larger proportion of women.&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, pp. 197-204.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second factor that brought about change was the early modern ascendancy of the individual, and focus on privacy.{{Ref label|C|c|none}} Already in the later Middle Ages castles had begun to incorporate an increasing number of private chambers, for the use both of the lord and of his servants.&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the castle was discarded to the benefit of [[palace]]s or [[stately home]]s, this tendency was reinforced. This did not mean an end to the employment of domestic servants, or even in all cases a reduction in household staff. What it did mean, however, was a realignment whereby the family &amp;ndash; in a genealogical sense &amp;ndash; became the cornerstone of the household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Phillippe, Georges Duby and Arthur Goldhammer | last = Ariès | title = A History of Private Life, Volume II, Revelations of the Medieval World | edition = | publisher = Belknap Press | location = | year = 2003 | pages = 513–4 | isbn=0-674-40001-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article focuses on internal '''migration''' as well as migration from and to '''[[Japan]]'''.

Between 6 million and 7 million people moved their residences each year during the 1980s. About 50 percent of these moves were within the same [[Japanese prefectures|prefecture]]; the others were relocations from one prefecture to another. During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by [[urbanization]] as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education. Out-migration from rural prefectures continued in the late 1980s, but more slowly than in previous decades. 

In the 1980s, government policy provided support for new [[urban development]] away from the large cities, particularly [[Tokyo]], and assisted regional cities to attract young people to live and work there. Regional cities offered familiarity to those from nearby areas, lower costs of living, shorter commutes, and, in general, a more relaxed life-style then could be had in larger cities. Young people continued to move to large cities, however, to attend [[university|universities]] and find work, but some returned to regional cities (a pattern known as U-turn) or to their prefecture of origin (a pattern known as J-turn). 

Government statistics show that in the 1980s significant numbers of people left the largest cities (Tokyo and [[Osaka]]). In 1988 more than 500,000 people left Tokyo, which experienced a net loss through migration of nearly 73,000 for the year. Osaka had a net loss of nearly 36,000 in the same year. However, the prefectures showing the highest net growth are located near the major urban centers, such as [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]], [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]], and [[Kanagawa]] around Tokyo, and [[Hyōgo Prefecture|Hyōgo]], [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]], and [[Shiga]] near Osaka and [[Kyoto]]. This pattern suggests a process of suburbanization, people moving away from the cities for affordable housing but still commuting there for work and recreation, rather than a true [[decentralization]]. 

Japanese economic success has led to an increase in certain types of external migration. In 1990, about 11 million Japanese went abroad. More than 80 percent of these people traveled as [[tourist]]s, especially visiting other parts of [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. However, about 663,100 Japanese were living abroad, approximately 75,000 of whom had permanent foreign residency, more than six times the number who had that status in 1975. More than 200,000 Japanese went abroad in 1990 for extended periods of study, research, or business assignments. As the government and private corporations have stressed [[internationalization]], greater numbers of individuals have been directly affected, decreasing Japan's historically claimed insularity. Despite the benefits of experiencing life abroad, individuals who have lived outside Japan for extended periods often faced problems of [[discrimination]] upon their return because others might no longer consider them fully Japanese. By the late 1980s, these problems, particularly the bullying of returnee children in the schools, had become a major public issue both in Japan and in Japanese communities abroad.

[[Ethnic issues in Japan|'''Ethnic issues''' in Japan]] and the situation of '''foreigners''' ([[Gaikokujin]] in Japanese) and [[Zainichi Korean|Korean residents in Japan]] in particular are described in the articles this sentence links to.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4912">The nation of [[Finland]] has never been an independent sovereign [[monarchy]]: no attempt to establish a fully-fledged Finnish monarchy has been successful. When it finally became established as a modern independent nation-state, it was &amp;ndash; despite [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|a very brief flirtation with monarchy]] &amp;ndash; in the form of a republic.

The only royal person buried in Finland is the wife of [[Eric XIV of Sweden|King Eric XIV of Sweden]], [[Karin Månsdotter|Queen Karin Månsdotter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/kb/artikkeli/519/ Kaarina Maununtytär (1550-1612)] Bibliografiakeskus, Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura. Retrieved 5-11-2012 {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early developments==
There are no records of ancient kings of Finland, but it is likely that various tribal leaders may have held the title of king.

Finland has been part of monarchical states as a sub-unit of a monarchy based outside Finland proper. After the 13th century [[Second Swedish Crusade|Swedish conquest]], Finland was part of the [[Kingdom of Sweden]], nominally as the [[Duke of Finland|Duchy of Finland]], with some brief feudal characteristics in the 16th century.  Elevation of Finland to a [[Grand Duke of Finland|Grand Duchy]] in 1581 had no effect on the stately position.

King [[Charles IX of Sweden]] briefly used "King of Finns" (''alla finnars konung'') as part of his official titulary during 1607-1611, although this had no impact on the official status of Finns or Finland.

==Duke Peter of Holstein-Gottorp==
{{main|Kingdom of Finland (1742)}}
In 1742, following the Russian occupation of Finland in the [[Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743)]] and vague promises of making the country independent, the [[Diet of Finland|four estates]] gathered in [[Turku]] and decided to ask Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] if the then [[Duke Peter of Holstein-Gottorp]], great-nephew of the late king [[Charles XII of Sweden]], could be proclaimed as the King of Finland. However, the political situation had soon outgrown the idea of Finnish independence, and it quickly evaporated.

==Autonomous Grand Principality==
{{main|Grand Principality of Finland}}
Following [[Finnish War|the capture of Finland from Sweden by Russia]] in 1809, Finland kept the Swedish constitution formally intact and became an autonomous region within the [[Russian Empire]] under the title of [[Grand Principality of Finland]]. The Russian Emperor wielded the powers formerly reserved for the [[King of Sweden]] as the [[Grand Prince of Finland]], creatively applying the autocratic [[Swedish constitution]] of 1772 and 1789. The first Grand Prince, [[Alexander I of Russia]], was the grandson of Duke Peter of Holstein-Gottorp, who had held the imperial throne for just 6 months in 1762 as [[Peter III of Russia]].

==Monarchy and early independence==
{{main|Kingdom of Finland (1918)}}
In December 1917, Finland declared her independence from Russia, in response to the [[October Revolution]] in Russia. The internal unrest in the country soon descended into an open [[Finnish civil war|civil war]] between the Reds (i.e. revolutionary forces consisting of various socialist factions and the working class) and the Whites (i.e. pro-government forces, political conservatives and much of the middle and upper classes).  In the end the White side emerged victorious.  During the war, the Whites had been supported by [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]], and in an effort to cement the alliance with Germany, the [[Finnish parliament]], now purged of socialist members, elected [[Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse]] as the [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|King of Finland]]. Before Frederick Charles could move to Finland, however, the collapse of the [[Central Powers]] made the idea of German-born Finnish king untenable and he declined the throne. After new elections, the parliament, now again composed of representatives from all political parties, adopted a republican constitution of 1919 which was in effect, with numerous modifications, until 1999 and the basic structure of which is continued in the current [[Constitution of Finland|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/smur/1919/19190094001 Suomen Hallitusmuoto]. Säädösmuutosten viitetietokanta. Retrieved 2016-01-14. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monarchy today==

In June 2014 there was a suggestion for reinstituting monarchy by some members of the Finnish [[National Coalition Party]] for the party's general assembly. While the proposal failed to garner any meaningful support, it got some national media coverage, which discussed the proposal mostly as a comic relief.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hs.fi/politiikka/Suomi+monarkiaksi+naiset+kutsuntoihin++kokoomuksen+puoluekokousaloitteet+yll%C3%A4tt%C3%A4v%C3%A4t/a1402457518158?ref=hs-art-new-3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mono''', or '''Alu''', is an [[Oceanic language]] of [[Solomon Islands]] reported in 1999 to be spoken by 660 people on [[Treasury Island]] (Mono proper), 2,270 on [[Shortland Island]] (Alu dialect), and 14 on [[Fauro Island]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

== Phonology ==
Mono-Alu language has been studied extensively by Joel L. Fagan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short grammar of the Alu language.|last=|first=|publisher=Not Identified|year=19-|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a researcher for the Department of Linguistics, Research School of Pacific Studies at Australian National University. Their publication, "A Grammatical Analysis of Mono-Alu (Bougainville Straits, Solomon Islands),"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammatical Analysis of Mono-Alu (Bougainville Straits, Solomon Islands)|last=Fagan|first=Joel|publisher=Department of Linguistics, Research School of Pacific Studies, THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY|year=1986|isbn=0 85883 339 5|location=Canberra, Australia|pages=|Pacific Linguistics=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the first and only translations and analysis of Mono-Alu language.

Joel L. Fagan identified the Mono-Alu language as having twenty eight phonemes. They are made up of nine diphthongs, and five vowels and fourteen consonants that make up the alphabet.

=== The Alu Alphabet ===

# The Alu alphabet has 19 letters: A B D E F G H I K L M N O P R S T U V.
# Of these letters: D was seldom used instead of R for euphony sake; but it has to be used now for the new foreign words or names introduced in the language spoken. H generally (not always) is or can be replaced by F.

==== Pronunciation ====

===== 1. Pronunciation of Vowels =====
'a' is usually pronounced as in "flat"

a sometimes pronounced as in "fast"

'e' is always pronounced as in "ten"

'i' is always pronounced as in "tin"

'o' is always pronounced as in "not"

'u' is always pronounced as in "put"

===== 2. Pronunciation of Dipthongs =====
'ai' is pronounced "aye" - e.g. "Galeai".

'ei' has no equivalent sound in English.

'oi' is pronounced "oy" - e.g. "ba-oi" (shark).

sometimes the letters are pronounced separately. - e.g. "o-i-sa" (echo).

'ui' used as a diphthong - e.g. "sui-o" (swallow)

used separately - e.g. "ku-i" (baby) with the exception

===== 3.Pronunciation of Consonants =====
'g' is always pronounced as in "Glas", "giddy". No reason to use in Alu 'q' as is done elsewhere. Here also, the words are fully written as they are pronounced - e.g. "ang (instead of 'ag'), "ing", "ong", "ung". When, exceptionally, the 'n' is after 'g' as in "gnora", owing to the nasal pronunciation, the accentuated 'n' can be used as in Choiseul.

'ng' is pronounced as in English with the exception of "uhg", the sound of 'u' being always the Latin one.

"ang" is pronounced as in "gang"

"ing" is pronounced as in "ring"

"eng" is pronounced as in "length"

"ong"is pronounced as in" wrong"

The other Consonants have the same sound in English."

== Numerals ==
The number system of Mono-Alu language is very similar to other Austronesian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letters written in Mono-Alu language of Western District, Solomon Islands to Hilary Forster of N.Z. ; Mono-Alu word list by Hilary Forster of N.Z. and a teacher from Shortland Islands, Solomon Islands|last=Lincoln, Forster|first=Peter, Hilary|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=Shortlands, Solomon Islands|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Mono-Alu shares the numbers two (elua) and five (lima) with the Hawaiian Polynesian language. A number for zero was available in the language, but it was under the same use as the word 'nothing.' Joel L. Fagan identified numbers from one to ten-thousand in Mono-Alu.

Mono-Alu also made use of Ordinal Numbers. However, only 'first' (famma) is an actual word, where every other number upward is a grammatical construct.

== Grammar ==
Mono-Alu language, like many other Austronesian languages, uses two separate pronounce for the first-person plural. One is inclusive, including the listener; and the other is exclusive, not including the listener. There are also no third-person pronouns available in the language. Joel L. Fagan translated Pronouns and their possessives.

The Mono-Alu language gets very specific for adverbs and other verb affixes. Verbs can be altered with a prefix, infix, and a suffix.

|equivalent to copula, alternate form nina
|-
| -titi
|strengthens the idea of repetition or duration
|}
Mono-Alu grammar also follows rules of gender.

=== The Noun ===

==== Gender of Nouns ====
There are to ways of indicating differences of Gender:

(a) by different words:

- e.g. Tiong : man - Betafa : woman

Fanua : men - Talaiva : women

Lalaafa : Headman - Mamaefa : Headwoman

Tua-na : his grandfather - Tete-na : his grandmother

Kanega : old man (husband) - Magota : old woman (wife)

(b) by using a ord indicative of sex:

- e.g. Kui manuale : baby(male) - Kui batafa : baby (female)

Boo sule : boar - Boo tuaru : sow

("Sule" and "Tuaru" are used for animals only)

In other cases, there is no distinction between masculine, feminine and neuter."

Some exceptions within the rules of Mono-Alu have been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Some Instruments Are Really Good Companions - Some Are Not. On Syncretism and the Typology of Instrumentals and Comitatives.|last=Stolz|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=Theoretical Linguistics 23. 113-200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Two adverbs of place, instead of being written with a double consonant, are written with one only accentuated.

- e.g. 'Nai (instead of NNai) - "here"

'Nao (instead of NNao) - "there"

Instead of the aspirate 'H', the letter 'F' can be used:

(a) in verbs preceded by the causative "Ha" (or "Fa")

- e.g. "Fasoku" (or "Hasoku") - "let come"

(b) in verbs preceded by the prefix "Han" (or "Fan") meaning reciprocity or duality

- e.g. "Fanua" (or "Hanua") - "mon"

"Mafa" (or "Maha") - "I, no" "&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is no word for 'the' in the language.

====== The Article ======
There is no definite article in Alu.

There is no indefinite Article as "a, an", it is replaced by the indefinite number; - "elea" (one)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Mozabite''', or '''Tunżabt''', is a [[Berber languages|Berber]] dialect spoken by the [[Mozabite people|Mozabites]], an [[Ibadi]] [[Berbers|Berber]] group inhabiting the seven cities of the [[M'zab]] natural region in the northern [[Sahara]]n [[Algeria]]. It is also spoken by small numbers of Mozabite emigrants in other local cities and elsewhere. Mozabite is one of the [[Mzab–Wargla languages]], a dialect cluster of the [[Zenati languages]]. It is very closely related to the nearby Berber dialects of [[Ouargla]] and [[Oued Righ Berber|Oued Righ]] as well as the more distant [[Gourara]].

It is very similar to the construction of modern lutes, and to the construction of Western [[lute]]s.&lt;ref name="mottola-kyvelos"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Mottola  | first = R.M.  | title = Constructing the Middle Eastern Oud with ter Kyvelos  | journal = American Lutherie  | issue = 94, 95  | date = Summer–Fall 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern oud is most likely derived from the Persian [[Barbat (lute)|barbat]]. Similar instruments have been used in the Middle East, North Africa, and [[Central Asia]] for thousands of years, including from [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], North Africa, the [[Caucasus]], and the [[Levant]]; there may even be prehistoric antecedents of the lute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62430171|title=The archaeomusicology of the Ancient Near East|last=1947-|first=Dumbrill, Richard J.

It is the direct ancestor of the European lute.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poché|first=Christian|year=2007|title=ʿūd|url=|journal=The New Grove|volume=26|pages=26|quote=(oud; pl.: ʿīdān). Short-necked plucked lute of the Arab world, the direct ancestor of the European lute, whose name derives from al-ʿūd (“the lute”). Known both from documentation and through oral tradition, it is considered the king, sultan or emir of musical instruments, “the most perfect of those invented by the philosophers” (Ikhwān al-Safāʾ: Rasāʾil [Letters] (1957), i, 202). It is the principal instrument of the Arab world, Somalia and Djibouti, and is of secondary importance in Turkey (ut, a spelling used in the past but now superseded by ud), Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan (ud). It plays a lesser role in Greece (outi), where it has given rise to a long-necked model (laouto); the latter is used in rustic and folk contexts, while the ʿūd retains pre-eminently educated and urban associations. In eastern Africa it is known as udi; in recent decades it has also appeared in Mauritania and Tajikistan. [...] The emergence of the ʿūd on the stage of history is an equally complex matter. Two authors of the end of the 14th century (Abū al-Fidā, or Abulfedae, and Abū al-Walīd ibn Shihnāh) place it in the reign of the Sassanid King Sh[ā]pūr I (241–72). Ibn Shihnāh added that the development of the ʿūd was linked to the spread of Manicheism, and its invention to Manes himself, a plausible theory because the disciples of Manes encouraged musical accompaniments to their religious offices. Reaching China, their apostolate left traces of relations between West and East, seen in a short-necked lute similar to the ʿūd (Grünwedel, 1912). But the movement’s centre was in southern Iraq, whence the ʿūd was to spread towards the Arabian peninsula in the 7th century. However, the texts mentioning the introduction to Mecca of the short-necked lute as the ʿūd were all written in the 9th and 10th centuries. The ʿūd spread to the West by way of Andalusia|via=Oxford Music Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest surviving oud is thought to be in Brussels, at the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Museum of Musical Instruments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oudmigrations.com/2016/03/02/alexandria-to-brussels-1839/|title=Alexandria to Brussels, 1839|website=oudmigrations|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early description of the "modern" oud was given by 11th-century musician, singer and author [[Ibn al-Haytham|Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham]] in his compendium on music ''Ḥāwī al-Funūn wa Salwat al-Maḥzūn''. The first known complete description of the ''‛ūd'' and its construction is found in the epistle ''Risāla fī-l-Luḥūn wa-n-Nagham'' by 9th-century Philosopher of the Arabs [[Al-Kindi|Yaʻqūb ibn Isḥāq al-Kindī]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://foredofico.org/CERMAA/?attachment_id=482|title=Théories de l'échelle et pratiques mélodiques chez les Arabes – Volume 1 : L'échelle générale et les genres – Tome 1 : Théories gréco-arabes de Kindī (IX&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle) à Ṭūsī (XIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle)|last=Beyhom|first=Amine|publisher=Geuthner|year=2010|isbn=978-2-7053-3840-4|location=Paris|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kindī's description stands thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[and the] length [of the ''‛ūd''] will be: thirty-six joint fingers – with good thick fingers – and the total will amount to three ''ashbār''.&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;The ''shibr'' (singular of ''ashbār'') is a measurement unit which equals roughly 18-24 cm, depending on the hand. It equates to the measured length between the tip of the thumb and the tip of the auricular finger when stretched flat and in opposite directions. The shibr otherwise measures 12 fingers (36:3): a 'full' finger should be about 2 cm in width.&lt;/ref&gt; And its width: fifteen fingers. And its depth seven and a half fingers. And the measurement of the width of the bridge with the remainder behind: six fingers. Remains the length of the strings: thirty fingers and on these strings take place the division and the partition, because it is the sounding [or "the speaking"] length. This is why the width must be [of] fifteen fingers as it is the half of this length. Similarly for the depth, seven fingers and a half and this is the half of the width and the quarter of the length [of the strings]. And the neck must be one third of the length [of the speaking strings] and it is: ten fingers. Remains the vibrating body: twenty fingers. And that the back (soundbox) be well rounded and its "thinning"(kharţ) [must be done] towards the neck, as if it had been a round body drawn with a compass which was cut in two in order to extract two ''‛ūds''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beyhom|first=Amine|year=2011|others=Paper for "The Oud from its Sumerian Origins to Modern Times", ICONEA Conference 2011 – 1–3 December 2011|title=Two persistent misapprehensions about the ''ʿūd''|url=http://foredofico.org/CERMAA/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amine-Beyhom-Two-common-errors-about-the-‛ŪD-from-iconea2011web.pdf|journal=Iconea 2011|volume=|pages=81–110 (85)|nopp=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] and Mesopotamia, the oud had only three strings, with a small musical box and a long neck without any [[tuning pegs]]. But during the Islamic era the musical box was enlarged, a fourth string was added, and the base for the tuning pegs (Bunjuk) or [[pegbox]] was added. In the first centuries of (pre-Islamic) Arabian civilisation, the oud had 4 courses (one string per course — double-strings came later), tuned in successive fourths. Curt Sachs said they were called (from lowest to highest pitch)  ''bamm'', ''maṭlaṭ'', ''maṭnā'' and ''zīr''.&lt;ref name=sachs&gt;{{cite book |last=Sachs |first=Curt |date=1940 |title=The History of Musical Instruments |url= |location=New York |publisher=W.

Modern tuning preserves the ancient succession of fourths, with adjunctions (lowest or highest courses) which may be tuned differently following regional or personal preferences. Sachs gives one tuning for this arrangement of five pairs of strings, d, e, a, d', g'.&lt;ref name=sachs/&gt;

Historical sources indicate that [[Ziryab]] (789–857) added a fifth string to his Oud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=neYsAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=oud+word+origin&amp;dq=oud+word+origin | title=Iraq| year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was well-known for founding a school of music in [[Al-Andalus|Andalusia]], one of the places where the oud or lute entered Europe. Another mention of the fifth string was made by [[Ibn al-Haytham|Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham]] (c. 965 — c. 1040) in his in his compendium on music ''Ḥāwī al-Funūn wa Salwat al-Maḥzūn''.

==Names and etymology==
The {{lang-ar|العود}} (''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-ʿūd or oud}}''&lt;span style="margin-left:1px"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; literally denotes a thin piece of wood similar to the shape of a straw. It may refer to the wooden [[plectrum]] traditionally used for playing the oud, to the thin strips of wood used for the back, or to the wooden soundboard that distinguished it from similar instruments with skin-faced bodies.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/barbat|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica - Barbat|last=During|first=Jean|date=1988-12-15|publisher=Iranicaonline.org|accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry George Farmer]] considers the similitude between ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-ʿūd}} ''and ''al-ʿawda'' ("the return" – of bliss).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farmer|first=Henry George|year=1939|title=The Structure of the Arabian and Persian Lute in the Middle Ages|journal=JRAS|volume=|issue=1|pages=41–51 (49)|quote=...from a work entitled Kitāb kashf al-humūūm...'ūd (lute) is derived from  al-'awda ("the return" meaning the days of pleasure may return [in the joy of the music of the lute]...)|jstor=25201835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete history of the development of the lute family is not fully compiled at this date, but archaeomusicologists have worked to piece together a lute family history. The highly influential organologist Curt Sachs distinguished between the "long-necked lute" and the short-necked variety.&lt;ref name=sachsshortlong&gt;{{cite book |last=Sachs |first=Curt |date=1940 |title=The History of Musical Instruments |url= |location=New York |publisher=W. W.

===Gandhara to Spain, the Persian barbat and Arab oud go to Europe===

Bactria and Gandhara became part of the [[Sasanian Empire]] (224–651). Under the Sasanians, a short almond shaped lute from Bactria came to be called the [[barbat (lute)|barbat]] or barbud, which was developed into the later Islamic world's ''oud'' or ''ud''.&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/barbat |title=Encyclopaedia Iranica – Barbat |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date=1988-12-15 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Moors conquered [[Al-Andalus|Andalusia]] in 711, they brought their ud along, into a country that had already known a lute tradition under the Romans, the [[pandura]].

During the 8th and 9th centuries, many musicians and artists from across the Islamic world flocked to Iberia.&lt;ref name=Menocal&gt;{{Citation|title=The Literature of Al-Andalus|author=Menocal, María Rosa, Raymond P.

By the 11th century, Muslim Iberia had become a center for the manufacture of instruments. These goods spread gradually to [[Provence]], influencing French [[troubadour]]s and [[trouvères]] and eventually reaching the rest of Europe. While Europe developed the lute, the ''oud'' remained a central part of Arab music, and broader Ottoman music as well, undergoing a range of transformations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oudmigrations.com/2016/03/08/journeys-of-ottoman-ouds/|title=The journeys of Ottoman ouds|last=|date=|website=oudmigrations|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the major entry of the short lute was in western Europe, leading to a variety of lute styles, the short lute entered Europe in the East as well; as early as the sixth century, the Bulgars brought the short-necked variety of the instrument called [[Komuz]] to the Balkans.

===Origins Theory from religious and philosophical beliefs===
[[File:Aleppo-Music0Band.jpg|thumb|left|[[Syria]]n musicians in [[Aleppo]] with an oud, circa 1915.]]
According to Abū Ṭālib al-Mufaḍḍal (a-n-Naḥawī al-Lughawī) ibn Salma (9th century), who himself refers to Hishām ibn al-Kullā, the oud was invented by [[Lamech (descendant of Cain)|Lamech]], the descendant of  [[Adam]] and [[Cain and Abel|Cain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kitāb al-Malāhī wa Asmāʾihā min Qibal al-Mūsīqā|last=ibn Salma|first=Abū Ṭālib al-Mufaḍḍal (a-n-Naḥawī al-Lughawī)|publisher=Al-Hay’a al-Miṣriyya al-ʿĀmma li-l-Kitāb|year=1984|isbn=|location=Cairo - Egypt|pages=13–14|quote=ذكر هشام بن الكلّى أنّ أول من عمل العود فضرب به رجل من بني قابيل، ويقال: قايين بن آدم، يقال له: لامك، وكان عمّر زمانا طويلاً، ولم يكن يولد لهُ، فتزوّج خمسين امرأة وتسرّى بمائتي سريّة [...] ثم ولد له غلام قبل أن يموت بعشر سنين، فاشتد فرحه، فلما أتت على الغلام خمس سنين مات، فجزع عليه جزعًا شديدًا، فأخذه فعلّقه على شجرة، فقال: لا تذهب صورته عن عيني حتى يتقطّع أشلاء أو أموت، فجعل لحمه يقع عن عظامه حتى بقيت الفخذ بالساق والقدم والأصابع، فأخذ عودًا فشقّه ورقّقه وجعل يؤلف بعضه على بعض، فجعل صدره على صورة الفخذ، والعنق على صورة الساق، والإبريق على قدر القدم، والملاوي كالأصابع، وعلّق عليه أوتارًا كالعروق، ثم جعل يضرب به ويبكي وينوح حتى عمي، فكان أول من ناح، وسمّى الذي اتّخذ: عودًا، لأنه اتُخذ من عود|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothetical attribution says that its inventor was [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ibn a-ṭ-Ṭaḥḥān adds two possible mythical origins: the first involves the Devil, who would have lured the "People of David" into exchanging (at least part of) their instruments with the oud. He writes himself that this version is not credible. The second version attributes, as in many other cultures influenced by Greek philosophy, the invention of the oud to "Philosophers".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Central Asia====
One theory is that the oud originated from the Persian instrument called a&amp;nbsp;''barbat&amp;nbsp;''(Persian: بربط ) or ''barbud'', a lute indicated by Marcel-Dubois to be of Central Asian origin. The earliest pictorial image of the barbat dates back to the 1st century BC from ancient northern [[Bactria]] and is the oldest evidence of the existence of the barbat.&lt;ref name="BARBAT"&gt;{{cite web |last1=During |first1=J |title=BARBAT |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/barbat |website=Encyclopaedia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of a form of the barbaṭ is found in a Gandhara sculpture from the 2nd-4th centuries AD which may well have been introduced by the [[Kushan]] aristocracy, whose influence is attested in Gandharan art.&lt;ref name="BARBAT"/&gt; The name barbat itself meant ''short-necked lute'' in [[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]], the language of the [[Sasanian Empire]], through which the instrument came west from Central Asia to the Middle East, adopted by the Persians.&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt;&lt;ref name=centralasia&gt;{{Cite book |last= Blum|first= Stephen|author= |title = Oxford Music Online|author-link= |date=20 January 2001 |publisher= Oxford Music Online, Grove Music Online|quote= The ‘ūd (lute) is believed to be a later development of a pre-Islamic Persian instrument called barbat...[was part of] eastwards diffusion of Middle Eastern and Central Asian chordophones... the pipa, likewise derived from the barbat or from its prototype|doi = 10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.05284|chapter= Central Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The barbat (possibly known as mizhar, kirān, or muwatter, all skin topped versions) was used by some Arabs in the sixth century.&lt;ref name=EncyclopiaIslam&gt;{{cite book|title=First Encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913-1936|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ro--tXw_hxMC&amp;pg=PA986|year=1993|publisher=BRILL|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-09796-4|page=986}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 6th century, a wood topped version of the Persian-styled instrument was constructed by al Nadr, called "ūd", and introduced from Iraq to Mecca.&lt;ref name=EncyclopiaIslam/&gt; This Persian-style instrument was being played there in the seventh century.&lt;ref name=EncyclopiaIslam/&gt; Sometime in the seventh century it was modified or "perfected" by [[Mansour Zalzal]], and the two instruments (barbat and "ūd shabbūt") were used side by side into the 10th century, and possibly longer.&lt;ref name=EncyclopiaIslam/&gt; The two instruments have been confused by modern scholars looking for examples, and some of the ouds identified may possibly be barbats.&lt;ref name=EncyclopiaIslam/&gt; Examples of this cited in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'' include a lute in the [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]] and the frontispiece from ''The Life and Times of Ali Ibn ISA'' by Harold Bowen.&lt;ref name=EncyclopiaIslam/&gt;

The [[Turkic peoples]] had a similar instrument called the ''[[komuz|kopuz]]''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chabrier|first=Jean-Claude|year=2008|title=ʿŪd|url=|journal=Encyclopedia of Islam|volume=|pages=534|quote=The ḳabūs (al-Ḥid̲j̲āz), ḳabbūṣ (ʿUmān), ḳanbūṣ (Ḥaḍramawt), ḳupūz or ḳūpūz (Turkey) is a very old instrument.

===Arabian oud, Turkish oud, and Persian barbat===
Modern-day ouds fall into three categories: [[Arab world|Arabian]], [[Turkey|Turkish]], and [[Iran|Persian]], the latter also being known locally as a [[barbat (lute)|barbat]].&lt;ref name=majnunn&gt;{{cite web |url= https://majnuunmusicanddance.com/persian-oud-barbat/ |title= Persian Oud – Barbat |last=Goldrick |first=Navid |date= 16 August 2013|website= majnunn music and dance|publisher= |access-date=31 March 2018 |quote=Because of these efforts the Arabic Oud and the Barbat are now once again part of the Iranian musical landscape. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This distinction is not based solely on geography; the Arabic oud is found not only in the Arabian peninsula but throughout the Arab-world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sonsdelorient.com/en/cordes/oud.html |title= Oud |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= sonsdelorient.com|publisher= |access-date=9 August 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish ouds have been played in Greece, where they are called outi, and in other locations in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.arabinstruments.com/types-of-ouds |title= Types of ouds |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=arabinstruments.com |publisher= |access-date=9 August 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabian ouds, such as the [[Iraq]]i oud, [[Egypt]]ian oud and [[Syrian]] oud, are normally grouped under the term 'Arabian oud' because of their similarities, although local differences may occur, notably with the Iraqi oud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oudforguitarists.com/types-of-ouds-ultimate-oud-buyers-guide-1/|title=Types of Ouds : The Ultimate Oud Buyers' Guide Part 1 - Oud for Guitarists|date=2013-09-17|newspaper=Oud for Guitarists|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all these categories are very recent, and do not do justice to the variety of ouds made in the 19th century, and also today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oudmigrations.com/2016/03/08/journeys-of-ottoman-ouds/|title=The journeys of Ottoman ouds|date=2016-03-08|website=oudmigrations|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabian ouds are normally larger than their Turkish and Persian counterparts, producing a fuller, deeper sound, whereas the sound of the Turkish oud is more taut and shrill, not least because the Turkish oud is usually (and partly) tuned [[major second|one whole step]] higher than the Arabian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oudcafe.com/stringing_and_tuning.htm|title=OUD CAFE - Stringing &amp; Tuning|website=www.oudcafe.com|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish ouds tend to be more lightly constructed than Arabian with an [[Wood finishing|unfinished]] [[sound board (music)|sound board]], lower [[action (music)|string action]] and with [[course (music)|string courses]] placed closer together. Turkish ouds also tend to be higher pitched and have a "brighter timbre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.arabinstruments.com/about-the-turkish-oud |title=About the Turkish oud|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= arabinstruments.com|publisher= |access-date= 9 August 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabian ouds have a [[scale length (string instruments)|scale length]] of between 61&amp;nbsp;cm and 62&amp;nbsp;cm in comparison to the 58.5&amp;nbsp;cm scale length for Turkish.

The modern Persian Barbat resembles the oud, although differences include a smaller body, longer neck, a slightly raised fingerboard, and a sound that is distinct from that of the oud.&lt;ref name=majnunn/&gt; See more information at the page: [[Barbat (lute)]].

'''Pakistani Canadians''' refers to the community in Canada of [[Pakistan]]i heritage or descent. It can also refer to people who hold dual Pakistani and Canadian citizenship.

==History in Canada==
People from the region that would later become Pakistan were among the pioneers who migrated from [[British Raj|British India]] to [[British Columbia]] at the turn of the century. By 1905, as many as 200 participated in the building of that first community from modern-day Pakistan, which for a time had a small makeshift mosque in [[Vancouver]]. But most of these immigrants were sojourners rather than settlers, and they either returned to Pakistan in 1947 or moved on to the [[United States]]. Subsequently, Canada imposed a ban on South Asian immigration that remained in place until after [[World War II]]. When Canada opened its doors to South Asians again in 1949, Pakistan had been established as an independent state. Most of the Pakistanis who had settled in British Columbia were [[Punjabis]] and took advantage of the new immigration policy to sponsor members of their families.

Pakistanis began [[human migration|migrating]] to Canada in small numbers in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Immigration regulations gave preference to those with advanced education and professional skills, and the Pakistanis who came during this period, and throughout the 1960s, generally had excellent credentials. Many of them considered themselves to be sojourners, who had come to earn but not to settle or were students who intended to return home when their degree programs were completed. While some went back, others remained to become the founding members of the Pakistani-Canadian community.&lt;ref name="Security"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=http://karygiannismp.com/6thlossofsecurityalarms.pdf |title=Loss of security alarms Pakistani Canadian|url=http://www.southasianfocus.ca/printArticle/40638 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-01-22|archivedate=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistani nationals were registered in undergraduate and graduate programs at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] as early as 1949, and at the [[University of Toronto]] from 1958 on. By the mid-1950s, there were five or six Pakistani families living in Montreal in addition to the students. This was probably the then largest concentration of Pakistanis in the country. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s most who arrived were young men pursuing graduate or professional studies.

In 1976, Prime Minister [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]] revised the [[Immigration to Canada|Immigration Act]], which saw an increase in Pakistani immigration to Canada. In the 1980s, during the Mulroney government, immigration levels were further increased. Pakistani Canadians in the 1980s tended to be urban, well-educated, and professional and are more or less familiar with western culture and ways of living. The dependents and relatives that they have since sponsored for permanent residence and citizenship to Canada in the years after 1990 happen to be characterized by lower levels of education, due to immigration by sponsorship. However, most of the Pakistanis immigrating to Canada are mainly students, professionals and economic migrants from the middle-class background who do tend to have reasonable levels of education.&lt;ref name="History of Pakistani Canadians"&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=bUgRw_az31QC |page=127 }} |title=The Muslim community in North America |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Integrating into Canadian society ===

Pakistanis have integrated well into [[Canadian|Canadian society]], partly due to the [[Canadian Government]]'s policies and assistance given to all immigrants settling in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Muslim Community in North America|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, they are known to assimilate into Canadian culture more easily than many other immigrant groups due to fewer language barriers; English is widely spoken in Pakistan among professional classes and is the [[official language]] of all state institutions.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} As well they usually have more educational credentials.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Ethnic classification ===
Most Pakistanis who immigrated to Canada are [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]], [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiris]], [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]], [[Balochi people|Balochis]] or [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajirs]]. There is, however, a sizable population of [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] living on Canada's west coast, mainly in [[Vancouver]]. There is also a small community of [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] in Canada who arrived between 1947 and 1971 and still identify themselves with [[Pakistan]]. Most Pakistani Canadians speak [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]]. However, many also speak a second or third language, as they often tend to keep hold of their native tongues, which includes  [[Urdu]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]]. There is no official classification of Pakistani Canadians. However, they are usually defined by [[Asian people|Asian]] or [[South Asian]].

== Demographics ==
Figures from the 2011 Canadian Census from [[StatsCan]] indicate that there are about 155,310 Canadians who claim Pakistani ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&amp;LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=1&amp;PID=105396&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=105277&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2013&amp;THEME=95&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF= |title=Tabulation: Ethnic Origin (264), Single and Multiple Ethnic Origin Responses (3), Generation Status (4), Age Groups (10) and Sex (3) for the Population in Private Households of Canada, Provinces, Territories, Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, 2011 National Household Survey  |publisher=2.statcan.ca |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Toronto'''
Toronto has the largest Pakistani-Canadian community in the country, with a majority living in the localities of [[Rexdale, Ontario|Rexdale]], [[East York]] particularly in [[Thorncliffe Park]] and also its western suburbs, [[Mississauga]] and [[Milton, Ontario]]. The commercial centre of Toronto's Pakistani community can be found on [[Gerrard Street East]] in [[East York]]. A large Pakistani population resides in this area, and is home to many Pakistani restaurants and stores. Popular days to visit the street are during [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] and [[Yom-e-Istiqlal]]. Toronto's Pakistani community is quite diverse with people from [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]], [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajirs]], [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]], [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] backgrounds. A small proportion also reside in the [[Greater Toronto Area]], including [[Milton, Ontario|Milton]], [[Brampton]], [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]], [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]] and [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]].
* '''Mississauga'''
Mississauga has a large concentration of Pakistanis in Canada, and is often referred to as "Begumpura" (colony of wives) among Pakistani-Canadians. This is due to the fact that many families in this area consist of a male head working in the [[Persian Gulf]], while the wives reside in Canada and thus become the head of the household. Many of the Pakistanis that live in Mississauga are from Karachi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2011/05/28/colony_of_wives_thrives_in_mississauga.html|title=‘Colony of wives’ thrives in Mississauga - The Star|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omnitv.ca/on/en/docs/begumpura/|title=Begumpura: The Wives Colony - Documentary Series - OMNI Ontario English|website=OMNI Ontario English}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urdu language|Urdu]] is also the top non-official language spoken in Mississauga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mississauga.com/news-story/3129891-urdu-top-non-official-language-spoken-in-mississauga/|title=Urdu top non-official language spoken in Mississauga|date=14 November 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Milton'''
Milton has one of the fastest growing population of Pakistani-Canadians.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Canadians of Pakistani-origin constitute about 4% of the population of Milton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHS Profile, Milton, T, Ontario, 2011|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=3524009&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Milton&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;A1=All&amp;B1=All&amp;GeoLevel=PR&amp;GeoCode=3524009&amp;TABID=1|publisher=Statistics Canada}}. Source says 3185 out of 83575 are of Pakistani origin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Vancouver'''
Vancouver has the fastest growing Pakistani community in Canada. Most Pakistanis who live in [[Metro Vancouver]] reside in areas such as [[Burnaby, British Columbia|Burnaby]] and [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], which is home to [[Punjabi Market, Vancouver|Punjabi Market]]. Other areas include [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] and [[New Westminster, British Columbia|New Westminster]].

== Religion ==
=== Muslims ===
{{Main|Islam in Canada}}
Most Pakistani Canadians are [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/pdf14/2014-world-population-data-sheet_eng.pdf|title=2014 World Population Data|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion figures prominently in the lives of Pakistani Canadian families. The majority of Pakistanis belong to the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] sects of [[Islam]];&lt;ref name="History of Pakistani Canadians" /&gt; In smaller towns in Canada where there may not be mosques within easy access, Pakistani Canadians make trips to attend the nearest one on major religious holidays and occasions. They worship at [[Masjid]]s alongside other Muslims who might trace their ancestry to all parts of the world; there are generally no separate Pakistani Canadian mosques. Pakistani Canadians also participate in and contribute to the larger Islamic community, which includes [[Arab Canadians]], [[Iranian Canadian]]s, [[Turkish Canadians]]s, and [[Asian Canadian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Analytic/companion/rel/canada.cfm |title=96F0030XIE2001015 - Religions in Canada |publisher=2.statcan.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistani Canadians have played important roles in many organizations, including:
* [[Dawoodi Bohra|Anjuman Burhani - Dawoodi Bohra Muslim Community]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torontojamat.com/|title=Welcome To Anjuman-E-Burhani (Toronto) Website|website=torontojamat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===
Although the majority of Pakistani Canadians are Muslims, there is a sizable community of [[Christian]]s as well. They worship at churches all over the country and share in the religious life of the dominant Christian culture of Canada. In recent times, Pakistani [[Zoroastrians]] (called [[Parsis]]) have come to Canada mainly from the cities of [[Karachi]]. Pakistani [[Hindus]] and [[Sikhs]] also tend to stay in their own communities and share religious and cultural life with fellow Indian Hindus and Sikhs.

== Culture ==
Many Pakistanis have utilized an adaptation technique, and are accustomed to a [[bicultural]] lifestyle. At home they live as traditional a life as possible. The old values and hierarchical decision-making patterns are generally respected, and traditional clothing, food, decorations, and language provide the warmth and reassurance of the familiar.

== Lifestyle ==
Most Pakistani Canadians live a comfortable suburban life, with the vast majority living in the [[middle class]] and upper-middle class.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} They tend to follow the residence pattern set by other Canadians in that they move to more affluent suburbs as their prosperity increases. Members of the community believe in the symbolic importance of owning homes.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples"&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=dbUuX0mnvQMC |page=1032 }} |title=Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, Pakistani parents in Canada appear to have successfully transported to their new home a stable family structure and the value system that supports it. While there are many cases of [[marriage]] and family breakdown, most Pakistani-Canadian children and young adults appear to respect their parents’ traditional values. Most marriages are apparently still arranged by families, although the prospective brides as well as the grooms usually participate in the decision.

;Women
An important aspect of Pakistani participation in the [[Canadian economy]] has been the increasing number of Pakistani-Canadian women who work outside the home. The need for two incomes to maintain a family’s standard of living has required many wives and mothers to leave the cloistered life at home that had been customary in Pakistan and seek work for wages. While the new situation has created problems within families, and particularly between couples, it has also provided the opportunity for women to participate more fully in Canadian society, and many have enthusiastically embraced the change. Women who arrived in the family-immigrant class possess a range of education and skills, but some who were from the middle class in Pakistan find themselves in working-class occupations in Canada. The result is a significant adjustment problem for them and their families.&lt;ref name="multiculturalcanada.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/p1/4 |title=Community Life and Family and Kinship &amp;#124; Multicultural Canada |publisher=Multiculturalcanada.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Children
Young people who were born in Canada or brought as children share a particular set of issues and concerns with their parents and the wider Pakistani-Canadian community. Their perspective regarding [[adaptation]] and [[social integration|integration]] is generally not informed by significant direct experience of the culture and values of the homeland, and, as a result, parents and grandparents take on a mediating role. They have to decide what aspects of their traditional lifestyle and values must be left behind and what can be transferred to and re-established in their new home. Most significantly, they generally assume the responsibility for making these choices for their children as well. The family – even in its truncated form in the diaspora – is both the base for substantial cultural transfer and the source of intergenerational conflict.&lt;ref name="multiculturalcanada.ca"/&gt;

== Economics ==
;Employment
Most Pakistani Canadians work as [[professionals]] or in skilled trades.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Many are self-employed and own [[small businesses]]. Those who came to Canada from Pakistan via [[East Africa]] or the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf]] are more likely to be involved in [[business]]. A number of Pakistani Canadians are also [[Merchant|traders]] and are primarily involved in [[exporting]] and [[import]]ing goods to and from Pakistan. A few substantial [[Business|enterprises]] are also owned by Pakistani-Canadian entrepreneurs.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} A small number of them own [[factories]] in Pakistan and are engaged in importing Pakistani [[manufactures]]. Others have established textile mills in British Columbia and [[Ontario]] and are involved in multinational trade. Canada’s economic relations with Pakistan have shifted from [[aid]] to [[trade]] in the past decade. A number of Pakistani-Canadian [[businessmen]] and [[companies]] have participated in this development.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples" /&gt;

;Labour Force
The Pakistani-Canadian labour force is dispersed, with no concentration in a particular kind of work, and there are no large Pakistani businesses that employ substantial numbers of Pakistani workers. The incomes of Pakistani Canadians are generally comparable to the national average.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} For the immigrant generation a number of problems – underemployment, difficulties in having their credentials accepted, concerns about bias in gaining employment, a glass ceiling on advancement once a job is secured – reflect the continuing challenges of settlement. For many, the transition has been relatively easy, but others have had to sacrifice a fully satisfying personal life in order to provide the opportunities that are now available to their Canadian-born children.

Pakistan is among the top 5 countries for skilled workers entering Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroimmcanada.com/attracting_skilled.htm |title=Canada Immigration :: Canadian Visa - Info on immigration to Canada - Attracting Skilled Immigrants |publisher=Metroimmcanada.com |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Income
The incomes of Pakistani Canadians are generally just above the national average.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Some incidence of [[poverty]] may be present among the newer [[immigrants]] (especially in Toronto),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/alumni/alumnimatters/apr-06/am_apr-06_povertystudy.php|title=Alumni &amp; Friends|website=www.yorku.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; who tend to take [[low-paying job]]s often due to a lack of 'Canadian experience'. Members of the family and the larger community tend to take care of each other, and to assist in times of economic need. Hence, it would be more common to turn to a community member for economic assistance rather than to a government agency. Relatively low levels of the community are therefore on [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and [[public assistance]], contrary to what many believe.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples" /&gt;

;Poverty
According to the 2005 census data for Canada, 44 percent of Pakistani-born immigrants in Canada were below the poverty line, being the second most poor group of immigrants in Canada, with many engineers, doctors and doctorates working as taxi drivers or security guards.&lt;ref name="dawnpakcan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dawn.com/2012/05/16/pakistani-canadians-falling-below-the-poverty-line/|last=Haider|first=Murtaza|title=Pakistani-Canadians: Falling below the poverty line|publisher=Dawn |date=2012-05-16 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 55 percent of Pakistani-born immigrants owned a home, and 44 percent lived in households with five or more people.&lt;ref name="dawnpakcan"/&gt; On an average, the wages of Pakistani-born immigrants were 70 percent of that of Canadians.&lt;ref name="dawnpakcan"/&gt;

== Relations with Pakistan ==

==History==
[[File:ExxonMobilBuilding.JPG|thumb|left|From 1963 to 2015 the club was located at the [[ExxonMobil Building]]]]
The club was founded in 1946. Several [[oil industry in the United States|oil businesspersons]] who met at the [[Rice Hotel]] had established the club.&lt;ref name=SarnoffBidding/&gt; It was originally housed on the top area of the Rice Hotel but it moved to the [[ExxonMobil Building]] in 1963 after an increase of membership.

The '''Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003''' ('''PREA''') is the first United States federal law intended to deter the [[Prison rape in the United States|sexual assault of prisoners]]. The bill was signed into law on September 4, 2003.

==Background==
{{Further information|Prison rape in the United States}}

Public awareness of [[Prison rape in the United States|prison rape]] is relatively recent and estimates of its [[prevalence]] vary widely.

In 1974 Carl Weiss and David James Friar wrote that 46 million [[Incarceration in the United States|Americans would one day be incarcerated]]; of that number, they claimed, 10 million would be raped.&lt;ref name="peek" /&gt; A 1992 estimate from the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] conjectured that between 9 and 20 percent of inmates had been sexually assaulted.&lt;ref name="peek" /&gt; Studies in 1982 and 1996 both concluded that the rate was somewhere between 12 and 14 percent. A 1986 study by Daniel Lockwood put the number at around 23 percent for [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum security prison]]s in New York.&lt;ref name="peek" /&gt; In contrast, Christine Saum's 1994 survey of 101 inmates showed 5 had been sexually assaulted.&lt;ref name="peek"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peek|first=Christine|year=2003|title=Breaking Out of the Prison Hierarchy: Transgendered Prisoners, Rape, and the Eighth Amendment|journal=Santa Clara Law Review|publisher=[[Santa Clara University School of Law]]|volume=44|issue=Entire Paragraph citation|pages=1211&amp;ndash;48|issn=0146-0315|oclc=2842601|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Tg/Breaking_Out_of_the_Prison_Hierarchy__Transgender_Prisoners,_Rape,_and_the_Eighth_Amendment.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-06-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010170831/http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Tg/Breaking_Out_of_the_Prison_Hierarchy__Transgender_Prisoners,_Rape,_and_the_Eighth_Amendment.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) released a paper called "[[No Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons]]", the single event that contributed most to PREA's passage two years later.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; HRW had published several papers on the topic of prison rape in the years since its initial report called "All Too Familiar: Sexual Abuse of Women in U.S. State Prisons", released in 1996, when there was barely any Congressional support for legislation aimed at [[prison rape]].&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; A 1998 attempt by Representative [[John Conyers, Jr.]] (D-MI), known as the Custodial Sexual Abuse Act of 1998, was attached to the reauthorization bill for the [[Violence Against Women Act]] but summarily removed and never reintroduced.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Brenda V.|date=Spring 2008|title=The Prison Rape Elimination Act: Implementation and Unresolved Issues|journal=Criminal Law Brief|publisher=[[Washington College of Law]]|issue=WCL Research Paper No. 2008–49|oclc=63521701|ssrn=1129810|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael J. Horowitz (lawyer)|Michael Horowitz]], a [[Hudson Institute]] [[senior fellow]], has been credited with playing a part in passing PREA by helping to lead a coalition of the bill's supporters.&lt;ref name="teret" /&gt;

==Support and lobby==
The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 was supported by a broad base of activists, lobbyists, and organizations, particularly [[Just Detention International]]. The [[Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission|Southern Baptist Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission]] lobbied for the passage of the legislation as did the conservative organization [[Concerned Women for America]].&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,97392,00.html|title=Confronting Prison Rape|last=[[Wendy McElroy|McElroy, Wendy]]|date=September 16, 2003|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups were part of a diverse coalition of human rights and religious groups which backed the legislation; other groups which supported the act were: [[Amnesty International USA]], [[Focus on the Family]], [[Human Rights Watch]], the [[NAACP]], the [[National Association of Evangelicals]], [[Penal Reform International]], [[Physicians for Human Rights]], the [[Presbyterian Church USA]], [[Prison Fellowship]], the [[Salvation Army]] and the [[Union of American Hebrew Congregations]].&lt;ref name="strode"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sbcbaptistpress.org/bpnews.asp?ID=16630|title=Law targeting prison rape signed; diverse coalition backed measure|last=Strode|first=Tom|date=September 3, 2003|publisher=[[Baptist Press]]|accessdate=2008-06-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327163535/http://www.sbcbaptistpress.org/bpnews.asp?ID=16630|archivedate=March 27, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2013/sep/15/prison-rape-elimination-act-standards-finally-in-effect-but-will-they-be-effective/|title=Prison Rape Elimination Act Standards Finally in Effect, but Will They be Effective?|date=September 15, 2003|publisher=Prison Legal News|accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was sponsored, in both houses of the [[U.S. Congress]], by a bipartisan group of legislators. The initial sponsors of the bill in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] were [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] (D-[[Massachusetts|MA]]) and [[Jeff Sessions]] (R-[[Alabama|AL]]) and, in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] the legislation was sponsored by Representative [[Frank Wolf (politician)|Frank Wolf]] (R-[[Virginia|VA]]) and Rep. [[Robert C. Scott|Bobby Scott]] (D-VA), who was the initial co-sponsor.&lt;ref name=strode/&gt; The Senate bill picked up four co-sponsors on the day it was passed, they were: Senators [[Mike DeWine]] (R-[[Ohio|OH]]), [[Dick Durbin]] (D-[[Illinois|IL]]), and [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-[[California|CA]]).&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; The House bill had a total of 32 co-sponsors, including Scott.&lt;ref name=thomas2&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:HR01707: H.R.1707 - Bill Summary &amp; Status File]", ''[[The Library of Congress]]'' [[THOMAS|THOMAS.gov]], September 4, 2003 (last update), accessed June 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed both the House and Senate by [[unanimous consent]]; it passed the Senate on July 21, 2003, and the House on July 25.&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:s.01435: S.1435 - Bill Summary &amp; Status File]", ''[[The Library of Congress]]'' [[THOMAS|THOMAS.gov]], September 4, 2003 (last update), accessed June 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=juveniletxt&gt;"[http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/about/PubLNo108-79.txt Public Law 108-79, September 4, 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526032451/http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/about/PubLNo108-79.txt |date=May 26, 2008 }}", ''[[Office of Justice Programs|Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Programs]]'', [[United States Department of Justice]], September 4, 2003, accessed June 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Act==

===Provisions===
The Act was passed by both houses of the [[U.S. Congress]] and subsequently signed by President [[George W. Bush]] in a [[White House]] ceremony on September 4, 2003.&lt;ref name=policechief&gt;Jordan, Andrew, Morgan, Marcia, and McCampbell, Michael. "[http://policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=864&amp;issue_id=42006 The Prison Rape Elimination Act: What Police Chiefs Need to Know]", ''The Police Chief'', vol. 73, no. 4, April 2006, accessed June 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=briefing&gt;"[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/09/20030904-4.html#2 Press Gaggle by Scott McClellan Aboard Air Force One en route to Kansas City, Missouri]", ''[[The White House]]'', ([[Press conference|Press briefing transcript]]), September 4, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The act aimed to curb prison rape through a "zero-tolerance" policy, as well as thorough research and information gathering. The act called for developing national standards to prevent incidents of sexual violence in prison. It also made policies more available and obvious. By making data on prison rape more available to the prison administrators as well as making corrections facilities more accountable for incidents pertaining to sexual violence and of prison rape it would more than likely decrease the crimes.&lt;ref name=nij&gt;National Institute of Justice Staff, "[http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/213137.pdf NIJ's Response to the Prison Rape Elimination Act]", ([[PDF]]), ''Corrections Today'', February 2006, accessed June 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major component of the PREA was the establishment of a "National Prison Rape Reduction Commission".&lt;ref name=policechief/&gt; The panel was established by the act and appointed in June 2004, though the law itself called for the commission's creation within 60 days of its passage.&lt;ref name=juveniletxt/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;Marshall, Carolyn. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/20/politics/20rape.html Panel on Prison Rape Hears Victims' Chilling Accounts ]", ''[[The New York Times]], August 20, 2005, accessed June 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The panel, known as the [[National Prison Rape Elimination Commission]] (NPREC), was charged with undertaking a study on the comprehensive effects of prison rape and its occurrences.&lt;ref name=juveniletxt/&gt; The commission was also charged with information gathering through a variety of sources including public hearings. Eventually the commission will issue a report which includes its findings, conclusions and any recommendations.&lt;ref name=about&gt;"[http://www.nprec.us/about.htm About NPREC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508054836/http://nprec.us/about.htm |date=2008-05-08 }}", ''National Prison Rape Elimination Commission'', accessed June 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition the law mandated that the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] (DOJ) "make the prevention of prison rape a top priority in each prison system".&lt;ref name=juveniletxt/&gt; The DOJ's [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] was mandated to produce an annual report on its activities concerning the topic of prison rape in the U.S. prison system.&lt;ref name=juveniletxt/&gt; The law also made several other mandates for the DOJ. The [[National Institute of Corrections]] (NIC) was ordered to offer training and technical assistance, provide a clearinghouse for information and produce its own annual report to Congress. PREA required the DOJ to create a review panel designed to conduct hearings on prison rape, this panel was given subpoena power as well. At the top of the Justice Department PREA authorized the Attorney General to dispense grant money to facilitate implementation of the act. These grants are administered by the [[Bureau of Justice Assistance]] (BJA) and the [[National Institute of Justice]] (NIJ).&lt;ref name="2006rept"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spr.org/pdf/NIC_report_2006.pdf|format=PDF|title=Report to the Congress of the United States on the Activities of the Department of Justice in Relation to the Prison Rape Elimination Act (Public Law 108-79)|date=July 2006|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]], [[National Institute of Corrections]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative [[Danny K. Davis]] (D-IL) introduced the Second Chance Act of 2007 on March 20 of that year, among its provisions was an amendment to PREA. The miscellaneous provisions of what was largely a law designed to help reintegrate criminal offenders into the community, extended the existence of the NPREC from 3 to 5 years after its inception date.&lt;ref name=thomas3&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.01593: H.R. 1593 - Bill Summary &amp; Status File]", ''[[The Library of Congress]]'' [[THOMAS|THOMAS.gov]], April 9, 2008 (last update), accessed June 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate version was introduced nine days later and sponsored by then-Senator [[Joe Biden]] (D-[[Delaware|DE]]). The Second Chance Act passed the House 347–62 on November 13, 2007. The bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent on March 11, 2008, and the life of the NPREC was extended when Bush signed the Second Chance Act of 2007 on April 9, 2008.&lt;ref name=thomas3/&gt;

===Juvenile justice===
PREA covers all adult, as well as juvenile detention facilities; the definition of prison for the purposes of the act includes "any juvenile facility used for the custody or care of juvenile inmates."&lt;ref name=juveniletxt/&gt; U.S. Congress, within the text of PREA, noted that young, first-time offenders are at an increased risk of sexually motivated crimes. Juveniles held in adult facilities are five times more likely to be sexually assaulted than juveniles held in juvenile facilities.&lt;ref name=juveniletxt/&gt;

===Signing statement===
Upon signing PREA, Bush issued a [[signing statement (United States)|signing statement]] to accompany the law's passage.&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coherentbabble.com/signingstatements/TOCindex.htm|title=Signing Statements: George W. Bush|last=Greene|first=Joyce A.|date=2006, 2007&lt;!--, 2008--&gt;|publisher=Coherentbabble.com|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=statement/&gt; The signing statement specifically exempted the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] from two parts of section 7 of PREA.&lt;ref name="statement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/09/20030904-9.html|title=Statement on Prison Rape Elimination Act|last=Bush|first=George W.|date=2003-09-04|publisher=[[The White House]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 7 deals with access for the NPREC to any federal department or agency's information that it deemed necessary to complete its job.&lt;ref name=juveniletxt/&gt; The two specific sections that the signing statement allowed the executive branch to ignore if "disclosure could impair deliberative processes of the Executive or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties" were 7(h) and 7(k)3.&lt;ref name=statement/&gt; The signing statement maintained that this was within the Constitutional authority of the president.&lt;ref name=statement/&gt;

===Temporary lock-ups===
PREA defines "[[prison]]" quite broadly, as "any federal, state, or local confinement facility, including local jails, police lockups, juvenile facilities, and state and federal prisons."&lt;ref name="teret"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teret|first=Stephen P.|author2=Julie Samia Mair|author3=Shannon Frattaroli|date=Winter 2003|title=New Hope for Victims of Prison Sexual Assault|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics|publisher=American Society of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics via [[Just Detention International]]|issn=1073-1105|url=http://www.justdetention.org/pdf/HopeforHealingweb.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106222005/http://www.justdetention.org/pdf/HopeforHealingweb.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-01-06|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, short-term lockups, such as holding facilities, and local [[jail]]s, regardless of size, are also subject to the provisions of PREA.&lt;ref name=cipp/&gt; Failure by local authorities and operators of such facilities to comply with the provisions of PREA results in a 5% reduction in federal funding to that agency for each year they fail to comply.&lt;ref name="cipp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cipp.org/sexual/index2.html|title=Police &amp; Law Enforcement Short-Term Holding Facilities (Lock-Ups) &amp; the Prison Rape Elimination Act: Information and Assistance for Law Enforcement &amp; Chiefs of Police|publisher=The Center for Innovative Public Policies|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

===Grants===
PREA authorizes money in the form of [[grant (money)|grant]]s for a wide variety of implementation associated activities. The grants can be utilized by state agencies for personnel, training, technical assistance, data collection, and equipment to prevent, investigate, and prosecute prison rape. Each state recipient is required to submit a report within 90 days laying out on what activities the money was spent on as well as the effect of those activities on prison rape within the state. In 2004 Congress appropriated [[US$]]25 million dollars for the grant program and in 2005 US$20 million.&lt;ref name=07update&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spr.org/pdf/SPR_PREA_update_3-29.pdf|format=PDF|title=Prison Rape Elimination Act Update|date=March 2007|publisher=[[Just Detention International]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BJA handed out $10 million of the 2004 appropriation in the fourth quarter of that year. The largest grant amount that year, $1 million, was handed out to the [[Department of Corrections]] in [[Iowa]], [[Michigan]], New York, [[Texas]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name=2006rept/&gt;

===Federal facilities===
{{Empty section|date=June 2008}}

===Immigration detention centers===

Some of the steps Manheim asserted [[Department of Homeland Security]] has taken included the development of a classification system to segregate violent and non-violent offenders, "widespread posting of instructions on how to report sexual misconduct", and PREA training for detention officers in the facilities.&lt;ref name="oralstatement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/66174.pdf |format=PDF |title=Oral Statements by the United States Delegation to the Committee Against Torture |last=Manheim |first=Thomas |date=2006-05-06 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |pages=13 |accessdate=2008-06-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516022203/http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/66174.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-16 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and studies==

===Annual reports===
In December 2007 [[United States Department of Justice]] published its 2006 report about rapes and sexual violence in American prisons. The report, which included information obtained from about 1.3 million prisoners, reported 60,500 cases of sexual violence ranging from unwanted touching to rape in 2006.&lt;ref name=kaufman/&gt; In total, 4.5 percent of American prisoners reported an incident of sexual violence in the study.&lt;ref name=kaufman&gt;Kaufman, Pat. "[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/journals/259/prison-rape.htm Prison Rape: Research Explores Prevalence, Prevention]", ''NIJ Journal'', No. 259, March 2008, ''[[National Institute of Justice]]'', [[United States Department of Justice]], accessed June 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congressional findings===
The U.S. Congress, within the text of PREA, conservatively estimated that at least 13 percent of the inmates in the United States have been [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] in [[prison]].&lt;ref name=sigler/&gt; Under this estimate, nearly 200,000 inmates now incarcerated have been or will be the victims of prison rape. The total number of inmates who have been sexually assaulted in the past 20 years likely exceeds 1,000,000."&lt;ref name=sigler&gt;Sigler, Mary, "By the Light of Virtue: Prison Rape and the Corruption of Character", ([http://ssrn.com/abstract=896784 Abstract w/ link to document]), ''Iowa Law Review'', Vol. 91, pp. 561-607, 2006, accessed June 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers were derived based on the "testimony of social scientists and penologists".&lt;ref name=sigler/&gt;

===Contracted research===
PREA mandated that the NIJ provide funding for research conducted by private contractors, considered experts within the field. In 2006 alone, NIJ funded three major studies of sexual assault in prison.&lt;ref name=07update/&gt;

One study, initially released in January 2006 before being finalized or peer reviewed,&lt;ref name=07update/&gt; by Mark Fleisher at [[Case Western Reserve University]] showed that prison rape was rarer than estimated.&lt;ref name=msnbc/&gt; Fleisher's study reported that most prisoners who claim to have been raped are looking for money, publicity, a transfer, or lying. The study was immediately questioned and disputed by members of NPREC. Both [[Reggie B. Walton]], NPREC chair, and commissioner Cindy Struckman-Johnson spoke out against the study, with Struckman-Johnson calling it unscientific.&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10896343/from/RS.2/ Disputed study: Prison rape, sexual assault rare]", ''[[Associated Press]]'' via [[MSNBC.com]], January 17, 2006, accessed June 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Fleisher released a substantially revised version of the report in November 2006, Stop Prisoner Rape (now [[Just Detention International]]) stated it was "still plagued by many of the same fundamental flaws as the initial version."&lt;ref name=07update/&gt;

==Reaction==
The speed with which the bill passed, and the fact it was passed without public pressure, has been called "surprising".&lt;ref name=teret/&gt; PREA went through both houses in July 2003, was presented to the president on September 2, 2003 and signed two days later. Human Rights Watch urged President Bush to sign the bill, and stated that if it were implemented correctly it would "catalyze nationwide efforts to eliminate prison rape by inmates and correctional staff."&lt;ref name=hrwpr&gt;{{cite press release| title = U.S.: Bush Should Sign Prison Rape Legislation| publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]| date = July 31, 2003| url = http://hrw.org/english/docs/2003/07/31/usdom6277.htm| accessdate =2008-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Weisberg]], co-writing with David Mills, argued in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' in October 2003 that PREA did little more than collect data. They argued that the bill's original title, the "Prison Rape Reduction Act", was probably a more likely predictor of its outcome.&lt;ref name="weisberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2089095/|title=Violence Silence: Why No One Really Cares About Prison Rape|last=[[Robert Weisberg|Weisberg, Robert]] and Mills, David.|date=2003-10-01|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar position was put forth by [[Mike Farrell]], writing in [[The Huffington Post]], where he stated, "the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission meets periodically to 'study the impact of prisoner rape.' While they study, rape continues."&lt;ref name="farrell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-farrell/ending-the-hidden-savage_b_91867.html|title=Ending the Hidden, Savage Routine of Prison Rape|last=[[Mike Farrell|Farrell, Mike]]|date=2008-03-17|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the decision was taken on the project, 210 neighborhoods were identified as underprivileged neighborhood, in 70 neighborhoods the project was completed, and will be performed in dozens of other neighborhoods. In the 160 of the first neighborhoods in which the project was implemented, the Population is about one million. Among the neighborhoods that participated in the project one may find: [[Pat, Jerusalem|Pat]], [[Baka, Jerusalem|Baka]], [[Talpiot]], and [[Ramat Amidar]].

'''Public science''' is an increasingly popular term for research that is conducted amongst, or includes, the [[public]]. Two traditions of public science have emerged, one based on [[participatory action research]] and another based on [[science outreach]].

The [[participatory action research]] approach seeks to develop  a critical framework for making systematic inquiry and analysis a public enterprise. It is committed to valuing knowledges that have been historically marginalized and delegitimized (i.e., youth, prisoner, immigrant, farmer) alongside traditionally recognized knowledges (i.e., scholarly). Through the formation of research collectives, it aims to share the various knowledges and resources held by its individual members so members can participate as equally as possible. The choice of appropriate research questions, design, methods and analysis as well as useful research products are decided collectively. Centres for this form of public science include the  [http://publicscienceproject.org/ Public Science Project] and the Society for Participation, Engagement, Action and Knowledge Sharing. 

Examples of public science projects in the [[participatory action research]] tradition include the [http://morrisjustice.org/ Morris Justice Project] and [http://ourfood.org.uk/ Our Food].

The [[science outreach]] approach has some similarities to [[citizen science]] but typically describes projects that are conducted outdoors or in another type of public or accessible space such as a public park, metro stop, library, university campus, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Arcand, K.K., Watzke, M., “Creating Public Science with the From Earth to the Universe Project” Science Communication. September 2011. 33 (3) http://scx.sagepub.com/content/33/3/398.abstract. &lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to [[public art]], there are aspects of collaboration, community support and involvement, and even site specificity&lt;ref&gt;Watzke, M., Arcand, K.K., “The Universe Brought Down to the Streets: The “From Earth to the Universe” Project”. Mercury magazine. Volume 39 #1. Spring 2010.  (excerpt: http://www.astrosociety.org/pubs/mercury/39_02/watzke.html)&lt;/ref&gt; involved.   

Public science efforts in the [[science outreach]] tradition include Science on the Buses, in which city buses in many major European Union cities were decorated with large informational science posters in November 2002.  Likewise, a project in Toronto placed “advertisements” with science facts on [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/06/busing-in-astronomy/] buses in Toronto during July 2009.

"Science City" is another example of a public science initiative that ran from June 1994 through May 1995. Created by staff and consultants from the New York Hall of Science, "Science City" was an outdoor exhibition that utilized the street, fences, buildings and other public structures in New York City to attract the "non-museum-going" public to the science in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, P.R. &amp; Cutting, J.M., 1996, “The Inside Story of Science City - An Outdoor Public Science Exhibition”. [[Curator: The Museum Journal]]. Volume 39 #4, p.245-261.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition asked questions such as "Why is it warmer in the city?", "What pulses under the street?" and "What's under the sidewalk?" to help increase public awareness about the science and technology that runs invisibly underneath modern urban life. 

[[Science Cafe]]s, founded by the public science pioneer [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/24/duncan-dallas/ Duncan Dallas] are a further public science effort that initiates a discussion on a science topic in pubs or cafes, usually with a local researcher in attendance to answer questions and present information.

[[Science festival]]s can also be grouped into this category of public science efforts, with modern incarnations of festivals including a range of learner-centered activities and events conducted in public spaces. 

Public science initiatives often attempt to reach new audiences (particularly, non-experts who might not actively seek out science), in addition to existing science outreach audiences, by hosting events in alternative [[informal learning]] environments.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, P., Lewenstein, B., Shouse, A. W., Feder, M. A.(Eds). 2009, Learning science in informal environments: People, places and pursuits. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, such public science projects are outside the walls of the [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]] or [[science museum]], where the main focus of the particular space is not typically science outreach.&lt;ref&gt;Norsted, B. A., 2010, “Take Me Out to the Ball Game: Science Outreach to Non-traditional Audiences” Science Education and Outreach: Forging a Path to the Future. ASP Conference Series, Vol. 431, p.170-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a specific public science initiative in astronomy is “[http://www.fromearthtotheuniverse.org/ From Earth to the Universe]” (FETTU), a project of the [[International Year of Astronomy]] 2009 (IYA2009).&lt;ref&gt;Russo, P. and Christensen, L.L. (Eds.), 2010 “International Year of Astronomy 2009 Final Report” International Astronomical Union, {{ISBN|978-3-923524-65-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; FETTU displayed large-scale images of astronomical objects with contextual information and supplementary materials and activities in non-traditional and mostly public locations such as parks, airports, art festivals, shopping malls, and others (see examples at http://www.fromearthtotheuniverse.org/event_photos.php). By 2011, FETTU had been exhibited at about 1000 sites worldwide, with 50 sites in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Arcand, K.K., Watzke, M., 2010, “Bringing the Universe to the Street: A Preliminary Look at Informal Learning Implications for a Large-Scale Non-traditional Science Outreach Project”. JCOM Journal of Science Communication. Vol. 09, Issue 02, 1. http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/09/02/Jcom0902%282010%29A01/&lt;/ref&gt; One result from FETTU demonstrated a trend towards more non-self-selective audiences for science communications in these public spaces.

'''Puelche''' is an extinct language formerly spoken by the [[Puelche people]] in the [[Pampa]]s region of [[Argentina]]. The language is also known as ''Gününa Küne'', Gennaken (Guenaken), Northern Tehuelche, ''Gününa Yajich'', Ranquelche, and Pampa.

== Classification ==
Puelche has long been considered a [[language isolate]]. Based on very limited evidence, Viegas Barros (1992) suggests that Puelche might be closely related to the language of the [[Querandí]], one of the [[Het peoples]], and Viegas Barros (2005) that it is related to the [[Chon languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lyle. (in preparation) "The classification of South American languages''. In Campbell &amp; Grondona (eds.), ''South America''. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; Further afield, inclusion in a putative [[Macro-Jibaro]] family has been posited.

{{sociology}}

'''Rural sociology''' is a field of [[sociology]] traditionally associated with the study of social structure and conflict in rural areas although topical areas such as food and agriculture or natural resource access transcend traditional rural spatial boundaries (Sociology Guide 2011). It is an active field in much of the world, originating in the United States in the 1910s with close ties to the national [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and [[land-grant university]] colleges of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociology of food and agriculture is one focus of rural sociology, and much of the field is dedicated to the economics of [[agriculture|farm production]]. Other areas of study include rural migration and other [[demography|demographic patterns]], [[environmental sociology]], [[resort town|amenity-led development]], public lands policies, so-called "[[boomtown]]" development, [[social disruption]], the sociology of [[natural resources]] (including forests, mining, fishing and other areas), rural cultures, and identities, [[rural health]] care, and educational policies. Many rural sociologists work in the areas of [[development studies]], [[community studies]], [[community development]], and [[environmental studies]]. Much of the research involves the [[Third World]].

== History ==

===United States===
Rural sociology was the first and for a time the largest branch of American sociology.

Histories of the field were popular in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry Nelson, ''Rural Sociology: Its Origins and Growth in the United States'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmund deS. Brunner,  ''The Growth of a Science: A Half-Century of Rural Sociological Research in the United States'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Rural sociology in Europe developed not in the old established universities but in the new countries that emerged after 1919 and were strongly influenced by the political philosophy of [[Agrarianism]], which promoted the farmer as the strength of society.  Czechoslovakia opened three research centers, and others opened in Romania and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Mirkowich, "Beginnings of Rural Sociology in Yugoslavia," ''Rural Sociology'' (1940) 5#3 pp. 351-4 [http://chla.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=chla;idno=5075626_4291_003 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statements==

The mission statements of university departments of rural sociology have expanded to include more topics, such as sustainable development. For example, at the University of Missouri the mission is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Department of Rural Sociology at the University of Missouri employs the theoretical and methodological tools of rural sociology to address challenges of the 21st century – preserving our natural resources, providing safe and nutritious food for an expanding population, adapting to climate changes, and maintaining sustainable rural livelihoods."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://dass.missouri.edu/ruralsoc/about/ "About Rural Sociology and Sustainable Development"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The University of Wisconsin set up one of the first departments of rural sociology.  It has now dropped the term "rural" and changed its name to the "Department of Community and Environmental Sociology."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.dces.wisc.edu/ "Who We Are"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the Rural Sociology Program at the University of Kentucky has evolved into the. "Department of Community and Leadership Development," while transferring the graduate program in rural sociology to the Sociology Department.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.uky.edu/Ag/Sociology/ "The Department of Community and Leadership Development"]&lt;/ref&gt; Cornell University's department of rural sociology has also changed its name to the department of Development Sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warrenhall.cals.cornell.edu/dev-soc.html |title=Department of Development Sociology : Academic Units : Cornell Warren Hall |publisher=Warrenhall.cals.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associations ==

Scholarly associations in rural sociology include:

* The '''[[Rural Sociological Society]]''' (RSS), of the United States, was formed in 1937 after years of discussion as a spinoff of the [[American Sociological Association|American Sociological Society]]. It publishes the scholarly quarterly journal ''Rural Sociology.''&lt;ref&gt;See [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291549-0831 webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  The full run of back issues is online from 1936-89 through Cornell University Library's program of putting online core historical resources in rural sociology.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://chla.library.cornell.edu/c/chla/browse/title/5075626.html#1940 listing]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''European Society for Rural Sociology''' (ESRS) was founded in 1957.  It says it is "the leading European association for scientists involved in the study of agriculture and fisheries, food production and consumption, rural development and change, [[rurality]] and cultural heritage, equality and inequality in rural society, and nature and environmental care."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ruralsociology.eu/ homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''International Rural Sociology Association''' (IRSA) has as its mission, to "foster the development of rural sociology; further the application of sociological inquiry to the improvement of the quality of rural life; and provide a mechanism whereby rural sociologists can generate dialogue and useful exchange." It published the '' International Journal of Sociology of Agriculture and Food.''&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.irsa-world.org/ homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''International Association for Society and Natural Resources''' (IASNR) publishes the journal, ''Society &amp; Natural Resources.''&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.iasnr.org/ homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journals ==

Several academic journals are published in the field of (or closely related to) rural sociology, including:
 
* ''[[Agriculture and Human Values]]''
* ''[[Journal of Agrarian Change]]''
* ''[[Journal of Peasant Studies]]''
* ''[[Journal of Rural Studies]]''
* ''[[Rural Sociology (journal)|Rural Sociology]]''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23365">The '''societal marketing'''  is a marketing concept that holds that a company should make marketing decisions not only by considering consumers' wants, the company's requirements, but also  society's long-term interests.

The societal marketing concept holds that the organization's task is to determine the needs, wants, and interests of a [[target market]] and to deliver the desired satisfactions more effectively and efficiently than [[competitors]] in a way that preserves or enhances the well being of both the individual consumer and society in general. Therefore, marketers must endeavor to satisfy the needs and wants of their target markets in ways that preserve and enhance the well-being of consumers and society as a whole. {{ref|Kotler2000}} It is closely linked with the principles of [[corporate social responsibility]] and of [[sustainable development]].

==Definition==
Societal marketing can be defined as a "marketing with a social dimension or marketing that includes non-economic criteria". &lt;ref&gt; Handelman, Jay M. and Arnold, Stephen J., "The Role of Marketing Actions with a Social Dimension: Appeals to the Institutional Environment," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 63, No. 3, July, 1999, pp 33-48&lt;/ref&gt;  Societal marketing "concerns for society's long term interests".&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, G.R., "The Marketing Concept: Necessary but sufficient? An environmental view," ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 24, No. 8, pp.23-30, https://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000000612&lt;/ref&gt; It is about "the direct benefits for the organization and secondary benefit for the community". &lt;ref&gt;McColl-Kennedy, J., Kiel, G., Lusch, R. and Lusch, V., ''Marketing: Concepts and Strategies,'' Nelson Australia, Melbourne, 2001, &lt;/ref&gt; Societal marketing distinguishes between the consumer's immediate satisfaction and longer term consumer and social benefits. Accordingly, [[Andreas Kaplan]] defines societal management as "management that takes into account society's overall welfare in addition to mere profitability considerations." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools | doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006 | volume=32 | issue=4 | journal=European Management Journal | pages=529–534| year=2014 | last1=Kaplan | first1=Andreas }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its a 3 dimensional concept of marketing ;Social welfare,Individual welfare,Company profits.

==Objectives== 
Various attempts to define the objectives of societal marketing have been noted,&lt;ref&gt;Gaski, J.F., "Dangerous Territory: The societal marketing concept revisited", ''Business Horizons,'' Vol. 28, No. 4, pp 42-47&lt;/ref&gt; such as:
* "[[Social responsibility]] implies that a business decision maker... is obliged to take actions that also protect and enhance society's interests.
* "Business has the responsibility to help [the consumer] ... It is the duty of business to promote proper consumption values."
* "Business leaders are mandated to adopt roles of leadership in  the advancement of our society to new levels of moral conduct."

==History==
The concept of societal marketing emerged in the early 1970s, promoting a more socially responsible, moral and ethical model of marketing in an effort to counter some of the more serious criticisms of marketing that had arisen out of the [[consumerism|consumerist]] movement around that time. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 36, No. 5/6, pp548-569, https://doi.org/10.1108/03090560210423014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Kotler]] is generally credited with introducing the societal marketing concept to the literature in a 1972 article "What Consumerism Means for Marketers" in the ''Harvard Business Review'' of 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell Reference, http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631233176_chunk_g978140510254422_ss1-48&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly Kotler believed that he had coined the term, "societal marketing" and was the first to codify it within the [[marketing literature]]. &lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., "What Consumerism Means for Marketers," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 50, No. 3, May-June, 1972, pp. 48-57 &lt;/ref&gt; Some marketing historians, notably Wilkie and Moore, have argued that a societal perspective was not new, and that evidence for it could be found in marketing theory and in marketing texts, since the discipline's inception in the early 1900s. &lt;ref&gt;Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., "Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought," ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp 224-232 DOI: 10.1177/0276146706291067; Wilkie, W. L. and Moore, E.S., "Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the “4 Eras” of Thought Development," ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp 116–146 &lt;/ref&gt; Kotler introduced both the concept of [[social marketing]] (extending marketing technologies into non-business areas) and societal marketing, arguing that the marketing concept and its technologies must be tempered and ultimately revised by adopting a more explicit social orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' 2002,  Vol 36, No. 5/6, pp 48-569&lt;/ref&gt; The novelty of Kotler's concept was the idea of "long-run consumer welfare", emphasizing that the short-term desires might not support the consumer's long term interests or be good for the society as a whole.

The societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Instead, marketing activities should strive to benefit society's overall well-being. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including: employees, customers, local communities, the wider public and government and consider the impact of their activities on all stakeholders. They ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society. Societal marketing developed into [[sustainable marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P and Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing,'' 9th ed., Prentice Hall, 2000; Griffin, R.W.  and Ebert, E.J., ''Business '' 5th edition, Prentice Hall, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Societal marketing requires businesses to include social, ethical and ecological considerations in product and market planning. &lt;ref&gt;Abratt, Russell and Sacks, Diane, "Perceptions of the Societal Marketing Concept", ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 23, No. 6, 1989, pp. 25–33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
Kotler identified four categories of products, classified in terms of long term benefits and immediate satisfaction: &lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., "What Consumerism Means for Marketers," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 50, May-June, pp. 54-56&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Papierosa 1 ubt 0069.jpeg|thumb|Cigarettes are typically classified as a '' pleasing products'' since they deliver immediate benefits with long-term social harm]]
#Deficient products, which bring neither long-run or short term benefits
#Pleasing products, which bring a high level of immediate [[Customer satisfaction|satisfaction]], but can cause harm to the society in the long run
#Salutary products, which bring low short term satisfaction, but benefit the society on the long run
#Desirable products, which combine long-run benefit and immediate satisfaction

Kotler's concept of societal marketing suggested that for the well-being of society, deficient products should be eliminated from the market, pleasing and salutary products should go through a product modification process to acquire desirable status, by incorporating missing short term benefits into salutary products and long term benefits into pleasing products, and the companies' ultimate goal should be to develop desirable products. Rather than focusing on selling a products, which can be good or bad for the consumers,  companies should focus on consumer and society's well-being.

==Examples==
Most companies recognize that socially responsible activities improve their image among customers, [[stockholders]], the [[financial community]], and other relevant publics. Ethical and socially responsible practices are simply good business, resulting not only in favorable image, but ultimately in increased sales.

*[[The Body Shop]]: The Body Shop International plc is the original, natural and ethical beauty brand. The company uses only plant based materials for its products. It is against [[Animal testing]], supports community trade, activate Self Esteem, Defend Human Rights, and overall protection of the planet. They have also their own charity, The Body Shop Foundation, to assist those working to achieve progress in the areas of human and civil rights, environmental and animal protection. Thus Body shop is really following the concept of Societal Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;The Body Shop, www.thebodyshop.com/_en/_ww/services/aboutus_company.aspx)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Avon Products|AVON]] Product inc. has started an initiative known as Avon [[breast cancer]] awareness crusade in 1993 in partnership with National Alliance of breast cancer Foundation (NABCO).They started selling pink ribbon pins which depicts the international symbol for breast cancer for$2 and donates $1 to NABCO. Through the crusade Avon sale representatives have raised billion of dollars for breast cancer education and access to early detection services for underserved woman. In addition, Avon's 45,000 US sales people have been trained to discuss breast cancer and importance of early detection with their customers and distributed 80 million flyers on breast cancer detection.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal marketing v social marketing==
Societal marketing should not be confused with [[social marketing]]. Societal marketing is a philosophy or mindset that informs marketing decisions whereas social marketing is a distinct branch within the marketing discipline. Societal marketing is concerned with the consideration of the social and ethical aspects of marketing planning. Social marketing is concerned with facilitating social change. A key difference is that the greater 'social good' is the ''principal'' consideration in social marketing while social benefits are one of a number of considerations in societal marketing.  

On the other hand, social marketing is a sub-branch of marketing that began in 1971, with the publication of an article by Kotler and Zaltman, emphasising a planned approach to achieving social change. It is primarily concerned with encouraging pro-social behaviours (e.g. recycling, sun-safety, safe driving practices) and discouraging anti-social behaviours (e.g. littering, drink-driving). &lt;ref&gt;Kotler P and Zaltman G., "Social Marketing: An Approach to Planned Social Change,"  ''Journal of Marketing, Vol. 35. No. 3, 1971, pp 3-12&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as an "adaptation of commercial marketing technologies to programs designed to influence the voluntary behavior of target audiences to improve their personal welfare and that of the society of which they are a part".&lt;ref&gt;Andreasen, A., ''Marketing Social Change: Changing Behavior to Promote Health, Social Development and the Environment,'' San Francisco: Jossey Bass, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social marketing uses more traditional commercial techniques and strategies, focusing on persuasion, to achieve goals for the greater social good. Its [[Advertising campaign|campaigns]] can either encourage [[merit good]]s, as for example fund raising for not-for-profit organizations or dissuade the use of [[demerit good]]s promoting society's well being, as non-smoking campaigns or promote the use of seat belts. Another characteristic of social marketing is that is planned to influence individual behaviour to improve well-being. It includes more than just [[advertising]] in traditional mass media, and may extend to educational programs and formal enforcement regimes in the case of road safety campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Belz, Frank Martin and Peattie, Ken, ''Sustainability Marketing,'' John Wiley and Sons, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It planned campaigns, implemented by governmental and non-governmental organisations. A clear example that differentiates societal from social marketing is a marketing campaign on non-smoking. A smoking cessation advertisement is an example of social marketing, but if the marketing strategies and techniques used in that campaign focus on increasing the well-being of society, that same campaign can be an example of societal marketing.

The societal marketing concept was a forerunner of sustainable marketing in integrating issues of social responsibility into commercial [[marketing strategies]]. In contrast to that, social marketing uses commercial marketing theories, tools and techniques to influence social change. Social marketing applies a "customer orientated" approach and uses the concepts and tools used by commercial marketers in pursuit of social goals like Anti-Smoking-Campaigns or fund raising for NGOs.

== Corporate social responsibility (CSR)==
Unlike societal marketing, CSR has existed for many years. Another difference is that CSR "focuses more in a [[corporate]] level and stakeholders", &lt;ref&gt; Belz, Frank Martin and Peattie, Ken, ''Sustainability Marketing,'' John Wiley and Sons, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; while societal marketing is more concerned about the consumer and their long term benefits. CSR social and environmental concerns are integrated into all business operations. CSR is mainly run by companies, while social marketing mainly by Government or Non profits organizations. One example of CSR among companies is what [[Häagen-Dazs]] is doing with their "microsite" to raise awareness to the general public about the preservation of the honeybee.

==Branding==
Corporations are the one who are striving during the whole time for improvements. They are turning to all kind of forms of [[corporate societal marketing]] programs to help build and repair their brand images.

Corporate Social Marketing, or CSM, usually refers to marketing efforts that have at least one social related objective, such as charity founding, among its goals. Typical examples are releasing a certain percentage of the final sale product to a charity related to the product, or sponsoring events that encourage social well-being such as the Olympic Games. Corporate Social Marketing benefits a company in many ways, but its main goal is to improve the image the public has of the company. A company that appears committed to improving the lives or others, the environment or other worthy causes is seen in a better light than one who doesn't, and more and more business are hoping to benefit from that.

So, it can be so, that CSM programs are becoming extremely popular because the leaders believe that it is a good business to be viewed as a socially responsible company.&lt;ref&gt;Business in the Community, "Businesses Use Marketing Muscle to Tackle Social Issues", in ''Cause-related Marketing Website,''&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though past research suggests that CSM may be effective in improving [[brand equity]] and increasing market share, there are limits to the effectiveness of these initiatives.

An example of his is how corporate social initiatives adversely affected purchase intentions if consumers perceived that the company would forgo product quality in order to be socially responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Sankar and Bhattacharya, C.B., "Does Doing Good Always Lead to Doing better, Consumer Reactions to Corporate Societal Responsibility," ''Journal of Marketing Research,'' Vol 38, May, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the nature of the CSM program, the intent of the corporation may not be as obvious to the consumers. This happens if the benefits to the corporation are not apparent or conflicts with what the consumer already believes about a specific firm or industry.

Since firms exist to make a profit, consumers may spend considerable energy in an attempt to infer motives related to the profit-oriented goals. As an example, a consumer may be suspicious of a tobacco company that undertakes a campaign to prevent underage smoking. If this is successful, the company would be affected and the cigarette sales will be lowered. So, in this situation, consumers' suspicions may lead them to infer motives that would actually protect the companies financial condition – as they are trying to improve their image to sell more cigarettes to adults. However, if a tobacco company undertook a CSM Campaign, that would sustain their business consumers may be able to infer profit motives more easily and then have a more favorable attitude toward the partnership. Therefore, it can be concluded that the attitude of the consumers could be better if they knew more about the motives of the companies and they were more obvious.

Another aspect that may cause suspicion with consumers is the amount of harm that a company has already done, either because of unsafe products or harmful production practices. It is logical that consumers are more suspicious to companies that sell harmful products. Again examples are the tobacco companies and alcohol companies as well. They will meet resistance from consumers when they undertake socially-oriented campaigns aimed at mitigating the effects of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeffler, Steve and Keller, Kevin Lane, "Building Brand Equity through Corporate Societal Marketing", ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 21, No. 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; That is why when different industries are separated, two very general dimensions are used – the harmful nature of the products and the harmful nature of the production methods.

This classification can briefly show how consumer are influenced by the various CSM efforts. Companies that work in this "dangerous" industries are not that successful always, because the consumers may be suspicious of any societal efforts the company attempts to undertake. Consumers will infer less society-serving motives and more self-serving motives for corporate societal marketing programs undertaken by firms that operate in mixed or sin industries.

Based on how easily consumers could infer profit-driven motives, are classified the types of CSM campaigns: Positively tied to product sales, positively tied to product sales, not directly tied to sales but aimed at sustaining the company's business, completely unrelated.

==Criticisms==
Societal marketing has been the subject of a number of criticisms: 

A key issue concerns the question of who decides what is in the public’s best interests. The moral agenda implicit in the societal marketing concept is underdeveloped and often implicit. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 36 Issue: 5/6, 2002, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; Gaski argued that marketers should step away from their classic goal of [[customer satisfaction]] and [[profit maximization]] while respecting the minimum governmental standards imposed by law and enter this [[public policy]] area, since marketers themselves would have to decide what actions are consistent with public welfare. Marketers might have neither the competence nor the right to determine the "public interest." Instead, it should be the customers who decide what is good for them, or their political representatives and dictate that to the industry. &lt;ref&gt;Gaski, J.F., "Dangerous Territory: The societal marketing concept revisited", ''Business Horizons,'' Vol. 28, No. 4, 1985, 42-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have argued that societal marketing is not a distinct concept, but rather it is a mere extension of the marketing concept. Others have pointed out that the literature in the field is vague, poorly defined and underdeveloped. &lt;ref&gt;Crane, A. and Desmond, J., "Societal marketing and morality", European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 36 Issue: 5/6, 2002, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; The societal marketing concept has become an excellent strategy for promotions with social dimensions and for exploring consumers' behavioural response to such corporate 'doing good'.

; Future development of the concept:
Societal marketing is gaining the marketers and consumer attention  and there is every reason to expect it to continue to evolve in practice. It focuses on providing win-win opportunities to companies, consumers and society. But achieving the compelling benefits for each party involved is very complicated. So much more research is needed. To achieve a win situation for organization involved, is dependent largely upon how the key constituents react. In this context, anticipating consumer reaction is really challenging which can be affected by number of factors that often vary across different segments. The several research questions remain to be answered like how different factors affects reaction to societal marketing and how do the various factors interact? How can societal initiatives be designed to leverage positive reaction and mitigate negative ones? &lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

For consumers to win, societal marketing must provide them with compelling benefits that increase their overall welfare. What benefits did societal marketing initiative actually provided to consumers? Are there direct benefits such as increased satisfaction with their interaction with commercial or nonprofit organization?
Determining whether there is a win situation for society by societal marketing initiative is the most difficult question to be answered. We turn to the two questions proposed by Bloom, Hussien and Szykmann (1995):  Is the society better off because of this program? Does corporate involvement result in better performance than if it would have been managed by NGOs or government agencies? 
Societal marketing is becoming globally popular but there exist a scarcity of research in this field. Therefore extensive future research is needed particularly investigating questions with respect to its impact on consumer attitudes to corporate image, product image and their purchase intention or brand choice as well as on positive impact on society.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom N. Paul and Gundlach T. Gregory, ''Handbook of Marketing and Society,'' Sage publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Farmer's Sun''''' (also known as the ''Canadian Farmer's Sun'' and ''The Weekly Sun'' at various times) was a [[Progressivism|progressive]] weekly periodical published in Ontario from 1892 until 1934. It was, at various times, the official organ of several successive political movements: the [[Patrons of Industry]], the Farmers Association of Ontario, and the [[United Farmers of Ontario]], and supporting the idea of a progressive farmers' political party.

==History==
The newspaper was founded in [[London, Ontario]] in May 1892 by [[George Weston Wrigley]], a long time publisher of labour newspapers.  The paper supporting the Ontario [[Patrons of Industry]], a rapidly growing agrarian reform movement. The Patrons were not a political party, but had political goals. They wanted a smaller and simpler government, abolition of railway subsidies and reduced reciprocal tariffs. They also wanted laws against cartels and monopolies.

In 1893 Wrigley agreed to devote three pages of his paper to the Patrons in return for their financial assistance.{{sfn|Cook|1994|p=1112}} The publication described itself as “the official organ of the Patrons of Industry of Ontario and Quebec.” In May 1894 the paper moved to offices in the ''[[Toronto Star|Evening Star]]'' building in Toronto. In 1895 the Patrons bought a 50% share of the paper, which claimed to have a circulation of 30,000. The paper gave extensive coverage to the Patrons, but also covered many other reform movements and proposals. It avoided religious controversy, but clearly took the [[Social Gospel]] position that the value of Christianity lay in practical deeds.{{sfn|Cook|1994|p=1113}}

In 1895-96 Wrigley published a paper named ''Brotherhood Era'', which he also inserted as a supplement in the ''Sun''. It was aimed at urban readers, and concentrated on the injustice of industrial capitalism, supporting causes such as the single tax, the eight-hour day and equal suffrage, and opposing militarism. By April 1896 the ''Sun'' was in financial difficulties, with declining circulation. Wrigley was replaced as editor by [[Goldwin Smith]].  In the [[Canadian federal election, 1896|1896 Federal elections]] internal dissensions appeared among the Patrons, who only won three seats.

With the decline of the party, the newspaper was sold to [[Goldwin Smith]]. Where Wrigley had used the paper to try to promote an alliance between farmers and labour, Smith aimed to turn the newspaper into "the voice of rural Ontario." He ceased publication of a supplement, ''The Brotherhood Era'', aimed at industrial workers and expanded the ''Sun'' to a ten-page publication with the slogan “An Independent Journal For Farm and Home.” 

The newspaper, now called ''The Weekly Sun,'' supported [[agrarianism]] and [[free trade]] and acted as the organ of the Farmers Association of Ontario until that organization dissolved in 1907. The newspaper had a circulation of 16,000 in 1909. Smith died in 1910 and the newspaper soon became the unofficial organ of the [[United Farmers of Ontario]] after its founding in 1914. 

In 1919, the newspaper's board of directors agreed to sell the ''Sun'' to the UFO which published it under its publication wing, the Farmer's Publishing Company, and renamed the newspaper ''The Farmer's Sun'', "the Official Organ of the United Farmers of Ontario." The paper soon increased its publication schedule to twice weekly.  Around this time, [[Agnes Macphail]] began contributing writing to the ''Sun'', including reminiscences about life in rural Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/Macphail/details.asp?ID=24161&amp;number=2|title=Women Pioneers of Proton Part 1|website=images.ourontario.ca|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fragmentation of the UFO in 1922, during a crisis of the UFO-led provincial government in Ontario under [[Ernest C. Drury]], circulation fell grew more conservative. Following the dissolution of a brief political alliance between the UFO and the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation of Ontario]] in 1934, the paper was sold to [[Graham Spry]] and [[Alan Plaunt]] who renamed it ''New Commonwealth'' and operated it as the organ of the [[League for Social Reconstruction]] and the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Ontario Section)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uoguelph.ca/ruralhistory/resources/Ellsworth-RuralPoliticization6.pdf|format=pdf|title=The Farmer's Sun|publisher=Uoguelph.ca|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/LeagueforSocialReconstruction.html|title=League for Social Reconstruction|publisher=Faculty.marianopolis.edu|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the UFO launched the ''Rural Co-operator'' as its new organ and to continue the tradition of the ''Sun''. The newspaper, which was published twice a month, subsequently became the organ of the UFO's successor, the [[Ontario Federation of Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofa.on.ca/uploads/userfiles/files/a%20brief%20history.pdf|format=PDF|title=Farmers Working For Farmers : A brief history of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture|publisher=Ofa.on.ca\Accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/data/625812965|title=ArchiveGrid : Correspondence, by-laws and clippings for the Rural Co-Operator, Toronto, Ontario, 1937-1963.|publisher=Beta.worldcat.org|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rural Co-operator'' changed its name to ''Farm &amp; Country'' in the 1960s and would continue publishing as a twice monthly tabloid until 1997 and then a glossy magazine until 1999 when the OFA's publishing arm, the Agricultural Publishing Company Ltd., went into receivership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agpub.on.ca/|title=Agricultural Publishing Farm and Country, Home Page|author=SLW Designs|publisher=Agpub.on.ca|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agrinewsinteractive.com/archives/article-1140.htm|title=OFA's Farm &amp; Country on the ropes|publisher=Agrinewsinteractive.com|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the magazine's former writers went on to found ''Better Farming'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betterfarming.com/content/better-start|title=A Better Start|publisher=Betterfarming.com|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tourbet el Bey''' ({{lang-ar|تربة الباي}}) is a [[Tunisia]]n royal [[mausoleum]] in the southwest of the [[medina of Tunis]] at rue Tourbet el Bey 62.&lt;ref name="qantara"&gt;[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=1303 Tourbet El Bey (Qantara)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917140104/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=1303 |date=2012-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the last resting place of most of the [[Husainid dynasty]] rulers of [[Tunisia]].  Among those not buried there are the last two - [[Muhammad VII al-Munsif|Moncef Bey]], who is buried in the [[Jellaz Cemetery]] and [[Muhammad VIII al-Amin|Lamine Bey]] who is buried in [[La Marsa]]. The building,  constructed in the reign of [[Ali II ibn Hussein]] (1759-1782)&lt;ref&gt;Georges Pillement, ''La Tunisie inconnue'', ed. Albin Michel, Paris, 1972, p.66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asmtunis.com/edifices-funeraires.php?id=130|title=Asmtunis – ASM Tunis|website=www.asmtunis.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-02-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307121930/http://asmtunis.com/edifices-funeraires.php?id=130|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the largest funerary monument in Tunis.&lt;ref name="tourbastunis"&gt;[http://www.lapresse.tn/28082010/11489/promenade-dans-les-tourbas-de-tunis.html Adel Latrech, « Promenade dans les tourbas de Tunis », ''La Presse de Tunisie'', 28 août 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722075654/http://www.lapresse.tn/28082010/11489/promenade-dans-les-tourbas-de-tunis.html |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first tourba of [[Al-Husayn I ibn Ali]] stands opposite it.

== Royal mausoleum ==
The building is topped with domes, the main ones covered with green tortoiseshell-shaped tiles, and the facades are of ochre sandstone, decorated at regular intervals by [[pilasters]] and Italian-style [[entablature]]s in light-coloured stone.&lt;ref name="tourbetbey"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prosper Ricard, ''Pour comprendre l'art musulman dans l'Afrique du Nord et en Espagne'', ed. Hachette, Paris, 1924, p.218&lt;/ref&gt; They correspond with the different funerary chambers inside which house the tombs of the ruling family and their wives, as well as of a number of their ministers and servants.&lt;ref name="tourbetbey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tourbastunis"/&gt; The tombs, dug into the ground, are covered with marble chests ornamented in [[Relief|bas relief]]. The [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] of the men have regularly-shaped columns bearing inscriptions, topped with a [[fez]] or a [[turban]]. Those of the women have marble plaques at each end, one of which carries an inscription.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Architecture and interior decoration ==
The monument is entered through a large hall which shows a distinct Italian influence in its decoration, mixed with [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] style, notably in the chamber of the beys. The mausoleum, which comprises eight funerary chambers covered with cupolas,&lt;ref name="qantara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tourbastunis"/&gt; is built around two [[patio]]s.  These are covered in slabs, and surrounded by [[portico]]s which rest on pillars of [[Carrara marble]] with neo-doric capitals. These patios open, on each side, into a funerary chamber.  Some of these chambers are also linked directly to each other.

The south-west side opens into the chamber of the Beys,&lt;ref name="qantara"/&gt; the most important chamber in the complex, housing the tombs of thirteen reigning Beys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=q1-ZQMT3RIAC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;lpg=PA312&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Autour des morts|date=2001|publisher=Publication Univ Rouen Havre|isbn=9782877756082|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chamber is square, with walls fifteen metres long, and it replicates the proportions of an Ottoman mosque: four large cruciform pillars support a large central cupola which is slightly bulbous in form and flanked by four demi-cupolas on the sides and four in the corners. The only other building with this form in the [[medina of Tunis]] is the [[Sidi Mahrez Mosque|Sidi Mahrez mosque]].&lt;ref name="qantara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tourbetbey"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/database_item.php?id=monument;ISL;tn;Mon01;12;fr|title=Discover Islamic Art - Virtual Museum - monument_ISL_tn_Mon01_12_fr|website=www.discoverislamicart.org|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intricate decoration of the room blends Italian, Ottoman and local influences; the lower parts of the walls and the pillars are covered in panels of polychrome marble [[marquetry]] to a height of 2.5 metres, while finely-sculpted plaster lines the caps of the cupolas.&lt;ref name="tourbetbey"/&gt;

The ceilings of the mausoleum, either [[vault (architecture)|vault]]s or cupolas, are ornamented with [[stucco]] in geometric or plant designs. Some of these are polychrome, with the richness of the colours denoting the rank of the people buried in the chamber. One in particular is surprising in its architectural form - a large oval cupola.  The walls are generally covered with ceramic tiles in orange and yellow hues, some of which were imported from Italy, particularly from [[Naples]], while others are of local manufacture, from the [[Qallaline]] workshops.&lt;ref name="qantara"/&gt;  The chamber of the reigning Beys is the only one richly decorated with polychrome marble in the Italian style.

The term '''trailing spouse''' is used to describe a person who follows his or her life partner to another city because of a work assignment. The term is often associated with people involved in an [[expatriate]] assignment but is also used by [[academia]] on domestic assignments.

The earliest citation of the term trailing spouse is attributed to Mary Bralove in the ''Wall Street Journal'' (July 15, 1981) in an article titled "Problems of Two-Career Families Start Forcing Businesses to Adapt" p.&amp;nbsp;29: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another personnel man remembers the promising executive he lost because her husband was a dentist who couldn't find a good practice to join in the area. To cope with this problem, some 150 northern New Jersey employers participate in an employer job bank. The bank is designed to provide job leads for '''"the trailing spouse"''' of a newly hired or transferred executive.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phenomena of expat trailing spouses is most apparent in the [[military]], [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]], and other [[government]] communities as well as the [[private sector]] where the employer regularly reassigns their employees to new locations. In each case, the trailing spouse is required to relocate and as a result faces a range of issues that impact their personal and working lives.

== Issues==
*'''Professional Sacrifice''' – It is not uncommon for a trailing spouse to sacrifice their professional / career goals during their trailing period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knežević|first=A|title=I've lost my identity, what have i gained?|url=http://expatriatesmagazine.com/index.php/publication/issue-1/contents/item/157-i%E2%80%99ve-lost-my-identity-what-have-i-gained?|work=Expatriates Magazine|location=Paris|pages=22–23|format=Print|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Family issues''' – Stresses caused by social, financial and cultural strains placed on the family relationships as a result of the assignment.
*'''Barriers to mobility''' – The willingness or otherwise of the trailing spouse or other family members to relocate. Lack of support by the sponsoring employer to address the needs of the trailing spouse.
*'''Work/life challenges''' – Difficulties associated with finding and maintaining meaningful work or other sense of worth while on assignments.
*'''Loss of identity''' – Difficulties associated with loss of identity and the subsequent period of reshape and remodelling that ensues in the new environment.&lt;ref name="The Trailing Spouse No Longer Need Be Such A Drag"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.expatarrivals.com/article/the-trailing-spouse-no-longer-need-be-such-a-drag | title = The Trailing Spouse No Longer Need Be Such A Drag | publisher = ExpatArrivals.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gender''' – Experiences and issues facing male trailing spouse vary from those faced by females.&lt;ref name="Adaptation of Trailing Spouses: Does Gender Matter?"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1211&amp;context=etd | title = Adaptation of Trailing Spouses: Does Gender Matter? | publisher = Anne M.

'''Usinaras ([[Devanagari]]:उसीनर)''' were an ancient people attested to have been living in central Punjab since remote antiquity. They were often associated with [[Madra]]s, [[Kekaya]]s, Sibis etc. and their territory formed part of [[Vahika]] country according to evidence of [[Pāṇini]].

== Usinaras in Vedic literature ==
There is a reference to [[princess]] Usinarini (i.e. ''queen of Usinara'') in the [[Rigveda]]&lt;ref&gt;10.69.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aitareya Brahmana]] seems to locate Usinaras along with the [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kurus]], [[Panchala]]s and the Vasas (''Savasa'') in middle region or [[Madhyadesha]] (Mid India).&lt;ref&gt;Aitareya Brahmana VIII.14.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kaushitakai Upanishada'' colllocates the Usinaras with the Satvat-Matsyas, the Kuru-Panchalas and the Svasas.&lt;ref&gt;The Upanishads, Part I (SBE01): Kaushîtaki-Upanishad: 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; They probably lived in a territory to the north of Madhyadesa, as neighbors to the [[Uttarapatha|Udichyas]] or the northerners. This is why the ''Gopatha Brahamana'' collocates the Usinaras and Svasas with the ''Udichyas'' or northerners.&lt;ref&gt;i.e ''Savasas-Usinareshu-Udichyeshu'', Gopatha Brahmana II. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

''Divyavadana'' refers to the Svasas as people of [[Uttarapatha]] with headquarters at [[Taxila|Takshasila]] to which king [[Ashoka]] was deputed by his father [[Bindusara]] as a [[Viceroy]] to quell their rebellion. The ancient Savasa or Svasa is said to be modern Chhibba which comprises ''Punch, Rajauri and Bhimbara''.

Thus, the Usinaras, the very neighbors of the Svasas must also be located in Punjab proper.

== Mahabharata references ==
There are many references to Usinaras in the [[Epic poetry|epic]] [[Mahabharata]]. At several places, it refers to king Usinara and his son prince [[Sibi]] or [[Shivi|Sivi]] whose charity has been enormously glorified by sage [[Markandeya]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 12.29.39; 1.93; 3.197 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Usinara prince in Draupadis’ Sywayamvara ===
''Adi Parava'' of [[Mahabharata]] says that prince Sivi, son of [[Usinara]] had attended Draupadi's self-choice (Swayamvara; "groom-choosing") ceremony along with the kings of neighbouring kingdoms viz Shalya, the king of Madra Kingdom, with his son, the heroic Rukmangada, Rukmaratha, Somadatta (king of Bahlika Kingdom) of the Kuru race with his three sons - Bhuri, Bhurisrava, and Sala and [[Sudakshina Kamboja]] the arch-bowman of the Puru race&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 1.185-13-15&lt;/ref&gt; '''See Ganguli's Trans''': [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01189.htm].

=== Usinaras in Kurukshetra war ===
The Usinaras had joined the [[Kurukshetra war]] on the side of [[Kaurava]]s. ''Karna Parava'' refers to the [[Kekaya]]s, the Malavas, the [[Madra]]kas, the [[Dravidian people|Dravidas]] of fierce prowess, the [[Yaudheyas]], the Lalittyas, the Kshudrakas, the Usinaras, the Tundikeras, the Savitriputras etc. who had supported [[Karna]] on 17th day of the war, as all having been slain by [[Arjuna]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 8.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usinaras as degraded Kshatriyas===
Anusasana Parva of Mahabharata states that the tribes of the [[Sakas]], [[Yavanas]], [[Kambojas]], [[Dravidas]], [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalingas]], Pulindas, Usinarass, Kolisarpas, Mahishakas and others were originally noble Kshatriyas but became Vrishalas (degraded Kshatriyas) due to their lose of contact with the Brahmanas.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 13.33.20-21 &amp; Mahabharata 13.35.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further epic references ===
According to Mahabharatra, Sibi was son of the king of Usinara country near [[Gandhara]]. The charity and devotion of prince Sibi have been greatly extolled by the sage Markandeya in the epic.

[[Mahabharata]] also speaks of Usinara princes as sacrificing on two small streams near [[Yamuna|Jamna]]&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 3.130.21&lt;/ref&gt; There was also one king Usinara i.e. king of Usinara country, contemporary of king Janaka of Videha. Garagya Balaki, a contemporary of Janaka lived for some time in Usinara country.

Mahabharata (and ''Katha sarit-sagara'') refer to Usinaragiri which is located near Kankhala at the point where [[Ganges]] issues from the hills.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 5.111.16-23; Katha sarit-sagara, (Ed) Durgaprasad and Kasinath Pandurang Parab, 3rd Edition, p 5. Kankhala is located near Hardwar in Saharanpur District in Uttar Prsdesh.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to be identical with ''Usiragiri'' of Divayavadana and ''Usira-dhvaja'' of Vanaya texts.&lt;ref&gt;Political History of Ancient India, 1006, p 60, Dr H. C. Raychaudhury.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an epic reference Suyajna, the king of the Usinaras.

== Bhagavata Purana and the Usinaras ==
[[Bhagavata Purana]] attests that the prince of [[Usinara]] along with princes from [[Matsya]], [[Kosala]], Vidharbha, [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]], Srnjaya, [[Kambojas|Kamboja]], [[Kekaya]], [[Madra]], Kunti, Anarta, [[Kerala]] was present at ''Samanta-pancaka'' in Kurukshetra at the occasion of the solar eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;
:Tatragataste dadrśuh suhrt-sambandhino nrpān
:Matsyośīnara-kauśalya-vidarbha-kuru-srnjayān
:Kamboja kaikayān madrān kuntīn ānarta-keralān
:Anyāmś caivātma-paksīyān parāmś ca śataśo nrpa
:Nandādīn suhrdo gopān gopīś cotkanthitāś ciram
:(Bhagavata Purana 10.82.12-13)

:'''Trans''':
:The Yadavas saw that many of the kings who had arrived were old friends and relatives-- the Matsyas, Uśīnaras, Kosalas, Vidarbhas, Kurus, Srnjayas, Kambojas, Kaikayas, Madras, Kuntis and the kings of Ānarta and Kerala. They also saw many hundreds of other kings, both allies and adversaries. In addition, my dear King Parīkṣit, they saw their dear friends Nanda Mahārāja and the cowherd men and women, who had been suffering in anxiety for so long.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200641/http://vedabase.net/sb/10/82/12-13/en]

Bhagavata Purana also states that the Usinaras, the Sibi, the [[Madra]]s, and the [[Kekaya]]s were the direct descendants of Yayati's son Anu. Sibi or Sivi is stated to be son of Usinara.&lt;ref&gt;"Anu, the fourth son of Yayati, had three sons, named Sabhanara, Caksu and Paresnu. From Sabhanara came a son named Kalanara, and from Kalanara came a son named Srnjaya. From Srnjaya came a son named Janamejaya. From Janamejaya came Mahasala; from Mahasala, Mahamana; and from Mahamana two sons, named Usinara and Titiksu.The four sons of Usinara were Sibi, Vara, Krmi and Daksa, and from Sibi again came four sons, named Vrsadarbha, Sudhira, Madra and atma-tattva-vit Kekaya...." (Bhagavata Purana, 9.23.1-4).&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.astrojyoti.com/bhagavatam9e.htm]

Consequently, in the literature, the Usinaras are often associated with the [[Shivi]]s or [[Sibi]]s (''Sibois of the Greek writings'') whose chief town Sibipura has been identified with [[Shorkot]], in [[Jhang]] district in Pakistan.

== Pāṇini's Ashtadhyayi ==
[[Pāṇini]] refers to the Usinaras in several sutras of his [[Ashtadhyayi]]&lt;ref&gt;II.4.20; IV.2.118&lt;/ref&gt; and mentions their land as a part of the Vahika country.&lt;ref&gt;cf: Kashika on Sutra IV.2.118: ''Usinareshu ye Vahikagramah''.&lt;/ref&gt; Though not stated specifically by Pāṇini, in all probability, the Usinaras were under a [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] government.&lt;ref&gt;India as Known to Paqnini, p 453, Dr V. S. Aggarwala.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usinara in Buddhist literature ==
There is a [[Buddhist]] reference to one Usinara, said to be king of [[Benares]] who lived in the time of Kassapa Buddha. His story is related in the Maha-Kanha Jataka.&lt;ref&gt;Jataka.iv.181ff&lt;/ref&gt; He is mentioned in a list of kings who, although they gave great gifts, could not get beyond the domain of sense.&lt;ref&gt;Jataka.VI.99.&lt;/ref&gt; It is however, not clear if this Usinara was from the Usinara clan or else it was his personal name only.

'''Women in Ivory Coast''' formed less than half the country's population in 2003.&lt;ref name="UNFPA-2003"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | vauthors = | title = Overview: Côte d'Ivoire Data extracted "from the publication ''Country Profiles for Population and Reproductive Health'', Policy Developments and Indicators 2005, produced jointly by UNFPA and Population Reference Bureau."| work = | publisher = [[United Nations Population Fund]]| date = | url = http://www.unfpa.org/profile/cotedivoire.cfm| format = | doi = | accessdate = 2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their social roles and opportunities have changed since the time of [[French colonial empires|French colonialism]].
 
From independence in 1960, women's status under the law was inferior to that of men, and this continued until the 1990s.  The legal changes following President's [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] death brought improvement in legal and educational opportunities for women at all levels, and women have been moving into the highest levels of business and government.

Cultural traditions and practices, too, have usually marked women for inferior status. While adherence to traditional roles persists, this continuity—as well as the traditions themselves—vary greatly with place and social context.  Ivory Coast has more than 60 ethnic groups, usually classified into five principal divisions: [[Akan people|Akan]] (east and center, including the "Lagoon peoples" of the southeast), [[Krou]] (southwest), [[Mandé]] (Mandé west and Mandé northwest groups), and [[Senufo people|Senufo]]-[[Lobi people|Lobi]] (north center and northeast). Each of these groups has its own traditional roles for women, as do the religions practiced in the country (Christian 20–30 percent, Muslim 15–20 percent, indigenous 35–50 percent).

Today's northern Ivory Coast was at the periphery of the [[Mali Empire]] and the great medieval states of the [[Sahel]], while with Portuguese (from the 1460s) and later French colonial expansion, women of the southern regions experienced wars of colonialism and resistance firsthand. In the 1970s, Ivory Coast was considered the economic leader of West Africa, but since the 1990s, poverty and conflict have increased, at times affecting women disproportionately.  The interplay of all these experiences has transformed the social roles of women in Ivorian society.

The main issue of gender equality in Ivory Coast is the education. According to CIA World Factbook, the literacy rate in Ivory Coast in total is 43.1%. 53.1% of males can read and write and only 32.5% of females can read and write. This shows that more than half of men can read, and less than half of women can read. It also states that the school life expectancy for males is ten years, whereas for girls it’s eight years. So far, no specific organizations have helped women education in Ivory Coast. However, many organizations have helped education for women in Africa as a whole, such as Africa Education Trust and Aid for Africa.

In order for women’s education to be as equal as the men’s in Ivory Coast, the government must provide more schools for free, so that the people don’t think about financial issues once they put their child at school, and so the parents can afford to put both their sons and daughters in school. Education is free in Ivory Coast, but the parents must provide the school supplies, which might be a challenge if they have more than one child (Our Africa). This might lessen the need for women to go to school. For this to happen, the people must inform the government and if they refuse, protest. Education is a basic right everyone should afford, no matter the gender.

By making education supplies free, it takes one more weight off of the adult’s shoulders. This would insure that more women will have an education. By doing this, the child labor would lessen, but at least they’ll have a good education and in the future, they’re more likely to have a job. This will make the citizens of Africa’s lives much easier in terms of finances and education.

==Women's roles on the eve of colonialism==
Ethnic and cultural groups defined women's status in different ways on the eve of colonialism, with beliefs about the role of women in society partly the result of specific ethnic background and historical circumstance. It has been argued that Ivorian cultures largely had a cultural bias against equality between the sexes, embodied in customary law and codified in the colonial period. But this view has been challenged by Ivorian writers, who argue that in many pre-colonial societies, women held political and /or economic power equal to many men.&lt;ref&gt;N'Dri Thérèse Assié-Lumumba. Les Africaines dans la politique : femmes baoulé de Côte-d'Ivoire. Paris,    L'Harmattan (1996).  See review at  [http://etudesafricaines.revues.org/document54.html  Pounthioun M. D. Diallo,  Assié-Lumumba, N'Dri Thérèse. -- Les    Africaines dans la politique : femmes baoulé de Côte-d'Ivoire]. Paris,    L'Harmattan, 1996, 206 pp. (« Points de vue »)., [[Cahiers d'études africaines]], 160, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Looking specifically at the ''N'Gongbo'' [[Baoulé people|Baoulé]] people, one writer contrasts Ivorian women's roles the traditional Western tradition where the public  and the private spheres are separated, with the superior public sphere  reserved for men, and argues that Western intellectuals transpose this model onto "traditional" societies in Africa.  Rather, the African experience is said to be characterized by  coexistence of parallel positions, overlapping roles, and cross gender  cooperation.

Amongst the [[Mossi people|Mossi]] peoples, women's inheritance of family land and possessions, while uncommon, is possible.

Women of the [[Dyula people|Dyoula]] Mande peoples, living traditionally in scattered communities across in long distance trade communities, were often powerful merchants in their own right.

The [[Gio Tribe|Gio or Dan people]] of the southwest regard domestic duties as the preserve of women, while many [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] women engage in farming and trade.

Women in bond labor communities, or those in cultures with strong [[Caste system in Africa|caste systems]] found themselves doubly discriminated against.

From the 12th century, but progressing more deeply into the north of Ivory Coast from the 16th century, Islam defined the status of women in Muslim communities.  [[Polygamy]], practiced among most Mande peoples since pre-Islamic days, was codified under Islam, which offered both protections and disadvantages. In Mande Muslim communities, the first wife has authority over any subsequent wives, sharing domestic work, and caring for the extended family, into which the wives' parents may be folded into the husbands family.

Finally, the [[African slave trade]], beginning in the 15th century destroyed whole communities, with women killed in slave raiding and associated warfare and those enslaved separated from families, and transported to the Americas (or to neighboring states) in brutal conditions. The beginning of the direct colonial period in the 19th century brought general dislocation, warfare, and large population movements, especially in the southern forest zones of West Africa, as the French moved in from the West and South in the 1860s–90s.

==Under French colonialism==

===Colonial law and women===
Role expectations for women were altered somewhat by colonial legislation, which liberated captives throughout francophone Africa in 1903, and then by the Mandel Decree of 1939, which fixed the minimum age of marriage at fourteen and made mutual consent a formal necessity for marriage. These decrees, while promulgated by colonial officials, affected rural areas only fleetingly.  Bonded and caste communities remained in [[serfdom]] like conditions until at least the World War I period, when a series of population movements and communal resistance changed many of these dependence relationships.  Wars during the early colonial period caused an increase in slave taking, in which women were separated from men and moved into new communities.&lt;ref&gt;see  Martin Klein. ''Slavery and Colonial Rule in French West Africa''. Cambridge University Press (1998) {{ISBN|0-521-59678-5}}: pp. 132–37, 208–209, 237–240. As the title indicates, Klein is concerned with the persistence of African slavery under French rule. He argues that customary law and French appointed chiefs allowed formal slavery to continue in some areas up to the 1920s, and the social relationship to survive through independence.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Jacquinot Decree of 1951 invoked the power of the state to protect women from claims to their services—by their own or their husband's family—after marriage, and enabled women to obtain a divorce more easily and invalidated in-laws' claims to any bride-price that had been paid to a woman's family to legitimize the marriage. This decree also recognized monogamy as the only legal form of marriage and allowed couples to marry without parental consent. Small numbers of girls were offered primary education by the French government (in urban areas), while Catholic missions, offered education to others, especially in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Thompson, Richard Adloff. ''French West Africa''. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press. (1958) pp. 527–28, 580–82&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, almost the entire population of the colony were colonial ''Subjects'', ruled under the French [[Indigénat|Code de l'Indigénat]].  In practice, this meant that women, like men, were ruled by decrees from a handful of French [[Cercle (French colonial)|Cercle Commanders]], who administered with little oversight, and carried out policies through a series of French appointed "Canton chiefs".  "Customary" law, outside Muslim areas, was usually rule decided by appointed chiefs and their officials, while only whites and a tiny number of educated African men were subject to French courts.  Whatever decrees issued at the colonial capital in [[Dakar]] were implemented at the discretion of local commanders, who usually preferred to leave social concerns to chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Suret-Canele. ''French Colonialism in Tropical Africa 1900–1945''. Trans. Pica Press (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial dislocation===
Women were especially affected by three colonial practices that increased in the early 20th century: forced labor, taxation, and military draft.  All of [[French West Africa]] was subject to periodic forced labor campaigns, which peaked in the 1930s, and declined thereafter.  Ivory Coast was unique, though, in that the north of the colony had white run [[cotton]] plantations, for which locals were pressed into service when migrant labor (mostly from modern [[Burkina Faso]]) was unavailable.  Unlike road building or other forced labor projects, for which men were called up for a period ranging from days to months, men (and some women) were pressed into cotton work for years at a time. While only a small number of women were drafted into French labor schemes, the process of taking men out of their communities for long periods of time meant that women were forced to provide for their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Suret-Canele. op sit, pp. 233, 247–48, 253–256.

"La Fin de la Chefferie en Guinée," ''Journal of African History'', Vol. VII, No. 3, pp. 459–93&lt;/ref&gt;  Women were also placed in positions of independence due to the recruitment of African troops (the [[Tirailleurs]]) which was especially heavy in Ivory Coast during the World Wars.  Men who survived these experiences came home less likely to accept the strictures of colonial or customary rule, and while they were away, women were forced to provide for, and sometimes lead, communities.&lt;ref&gt;Myron Echenberg, ''Colonial Conscripts: The Tirailleurs Senegalais in French West Africa'', 1857–1960.

===Independence struggle===
The political struggle for independence after the Second World War was organized around the [[Rassemblement Démocratique Africain]] (RDA), whose Ivorian section was led by [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]]. After his break with the [[French Communist Party]] in 1950, under pressure from the French administration, many of the socially progressive planks of the RDA platform were dropped, and once in power, many legal advantages given to women (in law alone) were reversed. Women played little role in the formal leadership of the RDA, yet women were crucial in demanding independence from France.

At the grassroots, women played an active role in the independence struggle across French West Africa. One dramatic example occurred in 1949, when protests by local women in [[Grand Bassam]] and [[Abidjan]] caused the administration to back down from the detention of RDA leaders, and help spread support for the party at a time in which it was facing severe repression.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson and Aldoff, pp. 128–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Independence==
At independence, the government of President [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] acknowledged existing decrees affecting the status of women and went on to establish the primacy of the nuclear family, raise the minimum age for marriage to eighteen, and condemn in general terms the notion of female inferiority. At the same time, however, legislation during the 1960s established a husband's right to control much of his wife's property, and it required a woman to obtain her husband's permission to establish a bank account or obtain a job. The government also placed restrictions on a woman's right to divorce, denied legal recognition of matrilineal rights of inheritance (inheritance by a man's nephews before his sons), and finally, condemned the practice of bride-price.

Houphouët-Boigny's political style and longevity shaped Ivorian elites into a wealthy, male, educated social stratum. By the late 1980s, women were beginning to emerge within this group, as education and acculturation enabled them to challenge the established order. Official attitudes toward the status of women were pragmatic, like most official attitudes in Ivory Coast.

In 1963 women reacted to the extent and direction of government control by forming the [[Association of Ivoirian Women]] (Association des Femmes Ivoiriennes—AFI). They also persuaded the president to establish the ''Ministry of Women's Affairs'' (''Ministère de la Condition Féminine'', later the ''Ministre de la solidarité et de la Promotion de la Femme'') in 1976 and to appoint AFI leader [[Jeanne Gervais]] as minister. Gervais's goals were to obtain better educational and employment opportunities for women and to establish judicial equality for women. Legislation was enacted in 1983 to allow a woman to control some of her property after marriage and to appeal to the courts for redress of a husband's actions.

==Civil War==
Women were greatly affected by the [[First Ivorian Civil War|Ivorian Civil War]], begun in September 2002, but coming on the heels of a decade of internal conflict. The growth of the concept of [[Ivoirité]], a 1990s nationalist movement which sought to exclude large portions of the population from "true" citizenship, was both championed by and caused the suffering of women.  Changes in nationality law meant that women married to Ivorian born men no longer considered citizens lost their citizenship as well.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Natalie LeBlanc. “Between Foreigners and Citizens: The Negotiation of Political Agency by Elder Malian Women in Côte d'Ivoire”, American Association of Anthropology, (AAA) Annual Meeting, Chicago, US, November, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side, some women leaders were prominent exponents of Ivoirité, most notably [[Simone Gbagbo]], the wife of the president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soirinfo.com/article.php3?id_article=3238 L'influence de Simone Gbagbo].

Once the war broke out into open conflict in 2002, women formed 52 percent of the estimated 700,000 [[Internally displaced persons]] during the war, while rape and sexual violence were widespread, especially in the north and west of the country. Both rebel and government forces have been accused of systemic sexual violence towards women as a tactic to terrorise populations suspected of opposition to their forces.  Women suffering the effects of such violence are often shunned, while customary law offers few remedies, and the formal court system has largely failed to prosecute perpetrators. Women have found themselves forced into prostitution in the wake of economic collapse in war torn areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.org/cpr/whats_new/focus_on_cotedivoire.shtml Focus on Women in Côte d’Ivoire].

"Government and rebel authorities appear to have directly or indirectly authorized sexual violence since the war began in 2002; the prevailing impunity for these crimes has emboldened the perpetrators at all levels."&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with the coming of relative peace in 2004, sexual violence remained a significant problem throughout both rebel- and government-held areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]], August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil war also was a venue for women's active participation. Both sides had special women's political organisations, most active of which are "Cadre de concertation permanent des femmes" (Ccpf) led by Dao Coulibaly Henriette, and the "Coordination of Patriotic Women of Côte d'Ivoire" ("Coordination des femmes patriotes de Côte d'Ivoire" - CFPCI).  A pro government group, the CFPCI is led by former Sports Minister Geneviève Bro-Grebé,&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Bro-Grebé, présidente du Collectif des femmes patriotes (CFPCI), [http://www.midici.com/brogrebe/?divina=detailart&amp;idart=1226 Geneviève Bro-Grebé official website].&lt;/ref&gt; and allied to the "[[Student Federation of Côte d'Ivoire|Young Patriots]]" student organisation, itself accused of fomenting violence against those perceived as disloyal to the government, including rape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&amp;id=ENGAFR310012007 CÔTE D'IVOIRE.

==Today==
[[Image:Cimarchebordroute.jpg|thumb|right|In spite of the ubiquity of women selling products in markets like this, Ivorian women are only half as likely to be in regular employment as men.]] 
The status of women, in practice and in the law, was still well below that of men through most of the 1980s, but educational opportunities for women were improving at all levels. In 1987 about one-sixth of the students at the National University of Ivory Coast were women, and the number of women in the salaried work force had also increased. Women made up almost one-fourth of the civil service and held positions previously closed to them, in medicine, law, business, and university teaching.

===Politics===
While prominent women take leadership roles in politics, their numbers are minimal. The first female parliamentarian was elected in 1965, and only 5.7 percent of parliamentary seats were held by women in 1990, and 8.5 percent in 2005. These women are disproportionally appointed to oversee ministerial portfolios (17.1 percent of ministerial posts in 2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdrstats.undp.org/countries/data_sheets/cty_ds_CIV.html 2007/2008 Report on Human development statistics: Côte d'Ivoire], UNDP.&lt;/ref&gt; At the highest political level, the wife of current President, [[Simone Gbagbo]], holds a powerful position as head of the ruling party's parliamentary bloc, and has been frequently spoken of as future head of state or Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soirinfo.com/article.php3?id_article=3238 Sur l'influence de Simone Ehivet Gbagbo]: Soir Info.&lt;br /&gt;Vincent Hugeux, « Simone Gbagbo, femme fatale », ''L'Express'', 20 fév 2003.&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.simonegbagbo.ci/article.php3?id_article=255 www.simonegbagbo.ci]&lt;br /&gt;
[http://ananzie.net/Les-femmes-noires-en-politique Les femmes noires en politique : un engagement de plus en plus prononcé] 6 oct 2006 Maryline Bella, ananzie.net.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor force===
As of 2005, women are half as likely to participate in the labor force than men, with 44.6 percent of women aged 15–64 in the workforce, versus 88.4 percent of men.&lt;ref&gt;UNFPA, 2005: Labor Force Participation Rate, 15–64, see below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's Rights==

===Demographics===
The total population of Ivory Coast consists of more males than females.&lt;ref name="UNFPA-2003" /&gt;  The life expectancy of males at birth is roughly the same as that of females (female: 41.2; male: 40.8.&lt;ref name="UNFPA-2003" /&gt;  This marks a downward trend since 1990, when average life expectancy was 53.4 for women and 49.6 for men.&lt;ref&gt;UNFPA-2005, below.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comparative rankings====
Since 1995, the [[United Nations Development Program]] has been keeping [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI), a ranking of aggregate statistics of development, with focus on gender inequality. Ivory Coast has consistently ranked in the lowest quarter of the GDI: dropping to 166 of 177 in 2007, from 145 in 2005. Out of the 156 countries with both HDI and GDI values, 150 countries have a better ratio than Ivory Coast's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdrstats.undp.org/indicators/268.html 2007/2008 Report: Gender-related development index, Gender-related development index (GDI) rank], UNDP.&lt;/ref&gt; This movement is in line with Ivory Coast's [[Human Development Index]] trend, which peaked in 1985, and has dropped ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdrstats.undp.org/indicators/14.html Human Development Index Trends]: 2007/8, UNDP.&lt;/ref&gt; While leading neighbors like [[Mali]], [[Niger]], Ivory Coast consistently lags [[Senegal]], [[Ghana]], and [[The Gambia]]. In comparison to Senegal and France, female life expectancy at birth is around 60 percent of French totals, and 14.1 years less than Senegal, but this trend roughly mirrors male life expectancy at birth&lt;ref&gt;See UNDP ref. France: 83.7 Senegal:64.4 Côte d'Ivoire: 48.3&lt;/ref&gt; Adult literacy rates are higher than Senegal's, but current female enrollment as a percentage of males is now less, and estimated earned income for females in Ivory Coast is dramatically less, while Ivorian men may expect to earn more than their Senegalese neighbors.  A Senegalese men (per person/year) will be expected to USD $2,346, and Senegalese women USD $1,256, while an Ivorian man will average USD $2,472, but Ivorian women average just USD $795.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdrstats.undp.org/countries/data_sheets/cty_ds_CIV.html 2007/2008 Report on Human development statistics: Côte d'Ivoire], UNDP. Comparison to [http://hdrstats.undp.org/countries/data_sheets/cty_ds_SEN.html Senegal's 2007 report].&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2004, Ivory Coast's combined primary, secondary and tertiary gross enrollment ratio (female enrollment as a percentage male) trails Niger and [[Eritrea]], even though its total percentage of children enrolled is much higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdrstats.undp.org/countries/country_fact_sheets/cty_fs_CIV.html Côte d'Ivoire comparative factsheet: Building the capabilities of women], UNDP.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproductive health===
2005 estimates are that the average Ivorian woman gives birth to 4.73 children, and 690 women per 100,000 die in childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/profile/cotedivoire.cfm United Nations Population Country Profiles for Population and Reproductive Health, Policy Developments and Indicators 2005, produced jointly by UNFPA and Population Reference Bureau]: For women of childbearing years, defined as 15–49.&lt;/ref&gt; While maternal mortality and fertility rates are declining, they are far above those of developed countries. Child mortality has in fact increased since 1990, with 101.3 children of every 1000 live birth dying before age five in 2005, an increase from 97.2 in 1990. 43.5 percent of women are married by the age of 18 (median: 19.8 for women, 27.6 for men), while the median age at first sexual intercourse for women is 16.1 years. 115.6 per 1000 women age 15–20 have given birth. Only 53 percent of women 15–24 know that condom use can protect them from [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="UNFPA 2005"&gt;UNFPA 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are stark disparities in women's lives in rural areas versus urban areas.  Women in rural communities are more likely to be married younger, give birth, and see children die in their first five years than urban women.  In rural areas 41 percent women between the age of 15–19 will give birth to their first child, with on 32.1 percent aided by a skilled attendant, in contrast to 18.9 percent of urban women of this age group giving birth, and 79.1 percent with birthing aid.&lt;ref name="UNFPA 2005"/&gt;

===Literacy===
[[Image:Ecolecodivoire.jpg|thumb|right|Boys and girls head to school in a northern town. Illiteracy rates for females, while still well above males, have dropped since 1990.]]
Female literacy trails that of males, though both are low by developed nation standards, at 50.9 percent overall, 57.9 percent male literacy, and 43.6 percent female literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Definition: age 15 and over can read and write. 2003 est., from CIA World Fact Book, via [[Demographics of Ivory Coast]]&lt;/ref&gt;  2005 illiteracy rates for females, while still well above males, has dropped since 1990 (74 percent to 57 percent for females 15 and over, 49 percent to 36 percent for males 15 and over).  Females between 15 and 24 saw their illiteracy rate drop from 60 percent to 41 percent in this period (35 percent to 26 percent for males).  School enrolment for girls still lags boys, with 68 percent of primary school aged and 17 percent of secondary school aged girls enrolled (89 percent and 30 percent for boys). The poorest children of both sexes are less likely to receive schooling, yet even in the top wealth quintile only 70.7 percent of girls aged 6–10 attend school (82.9 percent for boys).  This falls to 48 percent in the next lowest rung for girls (62.2 percent for boys).&lt;ref name="UNFPA 2005"/&gt;
