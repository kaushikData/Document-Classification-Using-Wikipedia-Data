==Biography==
Adele Lewisohn Lehman was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family on May 17, 1882 in [[New York City]], the daughter of Emma (née Cahn) and [[Adolph Lewisohn]].&lt;ref name=JWAAdele&gt;[https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/lehman-adele-lewisohn Jewish Women's Archive: "Adele Lewisohn Lehman 1882–1965" by Laurie Sokol] retrieved October 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a board member of the New York Service for the Orthopedically Handicapped; was both a founder and board member of the Arthur Lehman Counseling Service; served as the president of the [[P.S. 157|East Side Free School for Crippled Children]];&lt;ref name=JWAAdele /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulletin&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wLtJAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=Adele+Lewisohn+Lehman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YyA6Jj7Oj2&amp;sig=NVFPGGFMFwanlKF4H-o4BnwrqEc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsor3DjbrWAhUn_IMKHcLoBFg4ChDoAQg-MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Adele%20Lewisohn%20Lehman&amp;f=false|first=|last=|title=Bulletin Joint Distribution Committee Representing American Jewish Relief Committee, Central Relief Committee, People's Relief Committee|pages=143 |publisher=|date=September 2016|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the Purple Box, an outlet for the sale of goods made by disabled women; served as director of the Adoption Bureau; was a board member of the New York Board of Charities; a member of the Crusade for Children (part of the [[Child Welfare League of America]]); served as vice president of the [[League of Women Voters]] until 1945; and served on the board of directors for the [[Philharmonic Symphony Society of New York]] (elected 1947); and was a board member of the Hebrew Sheltering Guardian Society.&lt;ref name=JWAAdele /&gt; In 1957, the [[Lehman Hall|Adele Lehman Hall]] at Barnard College was named in her honor; the hall held the Wollman Library until 2015.&lt;ref name=JWAAdele /&gt;

==Personal life==
On November 25, 1901, she married [[Arthur Lehman]] (1873-1936), son of Babette (née Newgass) and [[Mayer Lehman]].&lt;ref name=JWAAdele /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bulletin /&gt; Arthur belong to the prominent Lehman family: his father was a co-founder of [[Lehman Brothers]]; his brother [[Herbert H. Lehman]], was a former governor and senator of New York; and his brother, [[Irving Lehman]], was a former judge of the New York state court of appeals.&lt;ref name=JWAAdele /&gt; 
They had three daughters: [[Dorothy Lehman Bernhard]] (1904-1969), [[Helen Lehman Buttenwieser]] (1905-1989), and [[Frances Lehman Loeb]] (1906-1996).&lt;ref name=JWAAdele /&gt;
Lehman died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] on August 11, 1965 at her home in Purchase, New York.&lt;ref name=JWAAdele /&gt; 
Lehman belonged to [[Congregation Emanu-El of New York|Temple Emanu-El]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=JWAAdele /&gt;
She was also a championship tennis player and won thirty-eight competitions.&lt;ref name=JWAAdele /&gt;

Lehman and her husband collected paintings, decorative arts, bronzes, ceramics, and tapestries from the 14th to 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=Frick&gt;[http://research.frick.org/directoryweb/browserecord.php?-action=browse&amp;-recid=7233 The Frick Collection: "Lehman, Adele Lewisohn, 1882-1965"] retrieved September 22, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Their collection consisted of [[Italian primitives]], and works by [[Henry Raeburn]], [[Jean Baptiste Greuze]], [[Francesco Guardi]], [[Corneille de Lyon]], [[Claude Lorrain]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Jan Van Goyen]], [[Aert van der Neer]], [[Albert Cuyp]], [[Jacob Isaacksz van Ruisdael]], and [[Thomas Lawrence]].&lt;ref name=Frick /&gt; After the death of her husband, she continued to expand her collection purchasing works by [[Van Gogh]], [[Rousseau]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Renoir]], [[Eugene Boudin]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[George Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Matisse]], [[Derain]], [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]], [[Childe Hassam]], and [[Degas]].

'''Biogen Inc.''' (previously known as '''Biogen Idec''') is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[biotechnology]] company based in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], specializing in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of [[neurodegenerative]], [[hematologic]], and [[autoimmune diseases]] to patients worldwide.

== History ==
Biogen was founded in 1978 in [[Geneva]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url        = https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/12/04/biogen-idec-biotechs-comeback-kid/ |title      = Biotech's Comeback Kid |publisher  = Forbes |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; by several prominent biologists, including [[Kenneth Murray (biologist)|Kenneth Murray]] of the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Phillip Allen Sharp]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Walter Gilbert]] of [[Harvard]] (who served as CEO during the start-up phase), [[Heinz Schaller]], [[University of Heidelberg]] and [[Charles Weissmann]], [[University of Zurich]] (who contributed the first product [[interferon alpha]]). Gilbert and Sharp were subsequently honored with [[Nobel Prize]]s: Gilbert was recognized in 1980 with the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work in understanding [[DNA sequencing]], while Sharp received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1993 for his discovery of [[split gene]]s.

In 2003, Biogen merged with [[San Diego, California]]-based IDEC Pharmaceuticals (formed in 1985 by [[Ivor Royston]], [[Howard Birndorf]] and others) and adopted the name Biogen Idec.&lt;ref name="Exhibit"&gt;{{cite web |title=Biogen and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Announce Merger To Create a New Biotechnology Industry Leader |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/875045/000104746903021993/a2113458zex-99_1.htm|quote="IDEC — Founded in 1985 to develop monoclonal antibodies. Founders include Ivor Royston, Howard Birndorf, Richard Miller and Brook Byers" |website=Exhibit 99.1 |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the merger, Biogen Idec became the 3rd largest Biotechnology company in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url        = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/24/business/idec-to-merge-with-biogen-in-6.8-billion-deal.html|title      = Idec to Merge With Biogen in $6.8 Billion Deal|publisher  = New York Times |accessdate=2003-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following shifts in research core areas, the company has since shortened its name, reverting to simply Biogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url        = https://www.wsj.com/articles/biogen-drops-idec-from-name-1427113639|title      = Biogen Drops Idec From Name|publisher  = Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2015-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biogen stock is a component of several stock indices such as the [[S&amp;P 100]], [[S&amp;P 500]], [[S&amp;P 1500]], and [[NASDAQ-100]] and the company is listed on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange under the ticker symbol, BIIB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url        = http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/biib|title      = Biogen Idec Inc. Stock Quote &amp; Summary Data|publisher  = NASDAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, the company announced it would acquire cancer specialist, Conforma Therapeutics for $250 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/biogen_idec_agrees_to_buy_swiss_company_fumapharm_996746|title=Biogen Idec agrees to buy Swiss company Fumapharm|last=PharmaTimes|date=2006-06-01|website=www.pharmatimes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the same month, the company announced its intention to acquire Fumapharm AG, consolidating ownership of [[Fumaderm]] and [[BG-12]], an oral [[fumarate]], which is being studied for the treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[psoriasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060531005276/en/Biogen-Idec-Acquire-Fumapharm-AG-Consolidates-Ownership|title=Biogen Idec to Acquire Fumapharm AG; Consolidates Ownership of Oral Compound BG-12 Being Studied for Multiple Sclerosis|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, the company announced it would acquire Syntonix Pharmaceuticals for up to $120 million, gaining Syntonix's lead product for hemophilia B as well as the technology for developing inhalable treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/biogen-to-buy-syntonix-120m-deal|title=Biogen to buy Syntonix in $120M deal {{!}} FierceBiotech|website=www.fiercebiotech.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20070104005533/en/Biogen-Idec-Acquire-Syntonix|title=Biogen Idec to Acquire Syntonix|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] broke the news that Biogen was planning the pay [[Élan|Elan]] $3.25 billion for the full rights to [[Tysabri]], used to treat multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-06/biogen-to-pay-elan-3-25-billion-for-full-tysabri-rights|title=Biogen to Pay Elan $3.25 Billion for Full Tysabri Rights|date=2013-02-06|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 the company announced it will acquire [[Convergence Pharmaceuticals]] for up to $675 million, with the acquisition aiming to accelerate the development of Convergence's pipeline, in-particular [[Raxatrigine|CNV1014802]] – a Phase II small molecule sodium channel blocking candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/biogen-idec-snaps-up-convergence-for-up-to-675m/81250789/|title=Biogen Idec Snaps Up Convergence for Up-to-$675M - GEN News Highlights - GEN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 the company announced it will lay off 11% of its workforce, effective immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/biogen-layoffs-cutting-11-of-workforce-2015-10|title=Biogen is cutting 11% of its workforce|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogen has focused its R&amp;D efforts on the discovery and development of treatments for patients with high unmet medical needs in the areas of neurology, hematology and immunology.

Investigational MS medicines:

* Daclizumab High-Yield Process (DAC HYP): is being developed as a potential once-monthly subcutaneous injection in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). DAC HYP is being developed in collaboration with [[Abbvie]], Inc. In June 2014, the companies announced positive top-line results from the Phase III DECIDE clinical trial, where DAC HYP demonstrated superiority over interferon beta-1a in annualized relapse rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

   |publisher  = Fierce Biotech
   |accessdate=2013-04-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anti-LINGO-1 (BIIB033) ([[Opicinumab]]): is the first candidate being investigated for its potential to remyelinate and repair neurons damaged by MS, currently in Phase 2 trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://multiple-sclerosis-research.blogspot.com/2013/05/lingo-promising-remyelination-target-in.html
   |title      = Lingo: a promising remyelination target in MS
   |publisher  = Multiple Sclerosis Research
   |accessdate=2014-06-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogen has several candidates in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in neurodegenerative and immunological diseases including MS, Alzheimer's disease, neuropathic pain, spinal muscular atrophy and lupus nephritis:

* Phase 2a: anti-LINGO-1 molecule ([[Opicinumab]]) in acute optic neuritis
* Phase 2b: anti-TWEAK monoclonal antibody in lupus nephritis
* Phase 2a: STX-100 in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
* Phase 2: Neublastin for neuropathic pain in 2013 
* Phase 3:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Phase 1/2: BIIB067 (ISIS-SOD1&lt;sub&gt;Rx&lt;/sub&gt;) for [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], in collaboration with Ionis

Biogen also has several development agreements in place with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to collaborate to leverage antisense technology in advancing the treatment of neurological disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-reports/top-20-biotech-licensing-deals-h1-2012/isis-pharmaceuticals-and-biogen-idec
   |title      = Isis Pharmaceuticals and Biogen Idec
   |publisher  = Fierce Biotech
   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Biogen formalized a joint venture with [[Samsung]], creating Samsung Bioepis. This joint venture brings Biogen's expertise and capabilities in protein engineering, cell line development, and recombinant biologics manufacturing to position the joint venture so Biogen can participate in the emerging market for biosimilars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

   |publisher  = BusinessWeek
   |accessdate=2013-12-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, Biogen entered into an agreement with Eisai, Inc., to jointly develop and commercialize two of their candidates for Alzheimer's disease, which have the potential to reduce Aβ plaques that form in the brains of patients, as well as to slow the formation of new plaques, potentially improving symptoms and suppressing disease progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

   |title      = Isis Pharmaceuticals and Biogen Idec
   |publisher  = Fierce Biotech
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogen also has since 2015 an agreement with AGTC for the development of gene therapy for ophthalmologic diseases such as X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) and X-linked  Retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP), and up to three other genetic diseases. To this aim, Biogen paid AGTC $124 million, including an equity investment of $30 millions, and up to 1,1 billion in future milestones.&lt;ref&gt;Biogen Offers Up To $1 Billion for AGTC’s Ophthalmology Gene Therapy, Xconomy Boston, David Holley, July 2nd, 2015, http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2015/07/02/biogen-offers-up-to-1-billion-for-agtcs-ophthalmology-gene-therapy/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bojan Križaj''' ({{audio|Sl-Bojan Križaj.oga|listen}}) (born 3 January 1957) is a Slovenian, back then Yugoslavian, former [[alpine skier]].  During his international career he competed for the then-existing [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. He competed at three Winter Olympics.&lt;ref name="SportsRef"&gt;{{cite Sports-Reference |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/kr/bojan-krizaj-1.html |title=Bojan Križaj Olympic Results |accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Križaj, born in [[Kranj]], was a member of a well known [[Tržič]] ski family so he started skiing at the age of 3. In the season 1976/77 he received the first World Cup point, qualified among the 15 best [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] runners and later during that season in [[Madonna di Campiglio]] he hit his first top 3 podium. On 20 January 1980 he achieved the first [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] World Cup victory in [[Wengen, Switzerland|Wengen]], [[Switzerland]] and later he won seven more times, thus still being Yugoslavia's and Slovenia's most successful male alpine skier to date.

At [[1980 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York]], [[United States|U.S.]], he reached the fourth place in [[giant slalom]], missing the bronze medal by only two hundredths of second. Four years later he took the [[Olympic Oath|athlete's oath]] at the opening ceremony for [[Sarajevo]]'s [[1984 Winter Olympics]]. He caused a stir when he spoke the oath not in [[Croatian or Serbian]] but in [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. Despite great expectations of the Yugoslav audience he finished ninth in [[giant slalom]], much less than expected. Križaj should also have competed at [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], [[Canada]], but he got injured a few days before the event.

His most successful World Championship was in 1982 in [[Schladming]], [[Austria]] where he received the silver medal in [[Slalom skiing|slalom]].

His most successful World Cup season was 1986/87 when he received the small crystal globe for the season's best slalom runner (that was the only men's crystal globe of that season not won by [[Pirmin Zurbriggen]]). Beside that he was the second in World Cup slalom standings in the  1979/80 and 1985/86 seasons and third in the 1980/81 season. His best position in overall World Cup standings was the 4th place in 1979/80.

He concluded his career in 1988 at the race in [[Saalbach-Hinterglemm|Saalbach]], [[Austria]] where he stepped off the skis right at the end of the track and walked into the finish area.

Since his skiing retirement he worked in many fields, including as importer of Austrian brand beer and adviser for ski products in [[Elan Line|Elan]] company.

In March 2006 he became Head of Slovenian Ski Pool.

'''Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone''' is an [[enterprise zone]] in [[Bristol]], England, focused on creative, high-tech and low-carbon industries. Covering an area of {{convert|70|ha}}, it is based around [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station]], which is being redeveloped by [[Network Rail]]. It also contains the area around the existing [[Temple Quay]] development, and the Silverthorne Lane and Avon Riverside areas. It includes the site of the planned [[Bristol Arena]],&lt;ref name=BP1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/enterprising-idea-radically-new-approach/story-19489241-detail/story.html |title=An enterprising idea with a radically new approach |newspaper=[[Bristol Post]] |date=8 July 2013 |accessdate=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402095845/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/enterprising-idea-radically-new-approach/story-19489241-detail/story.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the site of the [[University of Bristol]]'s planned Temple Quarter Campus.

==Establishment==
The creation of the zone was announced by Chancellor [[George Osborne]] in the Budget of March 2011,&lt;ref name=BP2&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-enterprise-zone-looks-momentum/story-20963315-detail/story.html |title=Bristol enterprise zone looks to keep up the momentum |newspaper=Bristol Post |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100649/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bristol-enterprise-zone-looks-momentum/story-20963315-detail/story.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was launched in 2012.&lt;ref name=BP1/&gt; The zone offers streamlined [[planning permission|planning controls]] and reduced [[business rates in England and Wales|business rates]]. Rates generated by the zone are channelled to five other areas in the region,&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-13681651 |title=Land near Temple Meads named as Bristol enterprise zone |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=7 June 2011 |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; designated Enterprise Areas. These are [[Avonmouth]] (focusing on manufacturing and distribution), [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (media and publishing), [[Emersons Green]] including [[Bristol and Bath Science Park]], [[Filton]] (high-tech) and [[Weston-super-Mare]] (business services). Development of the enterprise zone is coordinated by West of England Local Enterprise Partnership, [[Bristol City Council]], the [[Homes and Communities Agency]] (HCA) and Network Rail.&lt;ref name=BP1/&gt;

==Station and surrounds==
Network Rail is redeveloping the station,&lt;ref name=BP1/&gt; in conjunction with its [[21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line|electrification of the Great Western line]] which will cut the journey time from Temple Meads to [[London Paddington station]] to 80 minutes.&lt;ref name=BP2/&gt; Station Approach Road will be turned into a public square and the station's main entrance moved to the north side of the station.&lt;ref name=BBC6&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-20328428 |title=Bristol Temple Meads station to get £100m investment |work=BBC News Online |date=14 November 2012 |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, the council announced changes to the layout of the roads around the station, with the removal of Temple Circus roundabout and provision of better routes for pedestrians and cyclists.&lt;ref name=BBC5&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-30775854 |title=Bristol's Temple Gate layout change planned in £21m revamp |work=BBC News Online |date=12 January 2015 |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across Station Approach from the station,&lt;ref name=BP2/&gt; the Temple Gate redevelopment by TCN UK is a creative and digital campus for [[small and medium-sized enterprises]]. Redeveloped buildings include Bristol and Exeter House and Temple Studios. The latter opened in 2013.&lt;ref name=BP1/&gt;

==Temple Quarter Campus==
In November 2016, the University of Bristol announced that it will build a £300 million Temple Quarter Campus for c. 5,000 students, directly to the east of the station. It will replace an empty [[sorting office]] building, formerly operated by [[Royal Mail]] but derelict since 1997. The campus, which will include a new [[business school]], digital research facilities and a student village, is expected to open in 2021. It will also host Engine Shed 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/bristol-university-to-take-over-royal-mail-sorting-offices-by-temple-meads-for-new-300m-campus/story-29935566-detail/story.html |newspaper=Bristol Post |title=Bristol University to take over old sorting office by Temple Meads for new £300m campus |last=Yong |first=Michael |date=29 November 2016 |accessdate=29 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Business Times''''' is an English-language financial daily based in [[Singapore]] currently owned by [[Singapore Press Holdings]] (SPH). It is currently the only daily newspaper in [[Singapore]] that focuses on business and financial news. Its average daily circulation (print and digital editions combined) as of August 2016 was 36,900, according to SPH. &lt;ref&gt; [url=http://www.sph.com.sg/our-businesses/newspapers/the-business-times-the-business-times-weekend/ SPH].&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Business Times'' is published as a broadsheet on weekdays, with a weekend edition that is published as a compact-sized paper. On October 8, 2016, The Business Times revamped its weekend edition, featuring its own luxury [[lifestyle magazine]]. The main newspaper section for the weekend was also rebooted.

==History==

BT started as a supplement that was distributed three times a week with [[The Straits Times]]. On Oct 1, 1976, [http://www.businesstimes.com.sg The Business Times] became a newspaper in its own right. In June 1995, BT became the first English-language newspaper in [[Asia]] to go online. By 2000, [https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095605/http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/ BT's website] was offering news updates throughout the day. In February 2012, BT launched a sister site [http://www.btinvest.com.sg/ BTInvest], a portal focused on finance and investment. Over the course of 2012 and 2013, BT also rolled out mobile apps, for the [https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/business-times-for-iphone/id531275824?mt=8 iPhone], [https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/business-times-for-ipad/id531283825?mt=8 iPad] and [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ps.bt&amp;hl=en Android smartphones].

In October 2014, BT simultaneously refreshed its newspaper, website, tablet and smartphone apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businesstimes.com.sg/consumer/refreshed-paper-refreshed-newsroom|title=Refreshed paper, refreshed newsroom|first=Teh Shi|last=Ning|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One big change - applied to both its print and digital products - was in how it organises the news. Previously organised by geographical markets, BT's news is now categorised by industry sectors. The paper said that this was to underline its sharpened focus on business. Sections include: Companies &amp; Markets, Real Estate, Banking &amp; Finance, Energy &amp; Commodities, Technology, Consumer, Transport and Government &amp; Economy. Another important change for the [https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095605/http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/ BT website] was the shift to [[responsive web design]], which ensures that the site is readable and easy to navigate on any screen. Other key changes include an emphasis on [[visual journalism]] and [[data-driven journalism]], and the introduction of three new [[blogs]] on the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141014113048-39458673-five-things-to-know-about-the-new-business-times|title=Five Things to Know About the NEW Business Times|date=14 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 redesign also won BT an Award of Excellence from the [http://www.snd.org/ Society of News Design] in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snd.org/competitions/database/?d=1&amp;contest=&amp;ID=42367|title=Search Competition Database|date=16 August 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5058">{{Evidence law}}
The '''business records exception''' to the [[Hearsay in United States law|U.S. hearsay rule]] is based on Rule 803(6) of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (FRE).   It is sometimes referred to as the '''business entry rule'''.

==Scope of exception==
[[Business records]], for the purposes of the exception, are any writings or records of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnosis, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge are admissible if kept in the regular course of business and if it was the regular course of business to make that record, unless the source of information or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.

Business is used in Rule 803(6) to mean any business, institution, association, [[profession]], or occupation, regardless of whether or not it is conducted for [[Profit (economics)|profit]].  Therefore, such records could conceivably include those of [[Religion|religious]] and [[charitable organization]]s, [[hospital]]s, [[school]]s, and even criminal organizations.&lt;ref name="federalevidence.com"&gt;http://federalevidence.com/rules-of-evidence#Rule803&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The basic rationale for the exception is that employees are under a duty to be accurate in observing, reporting, and recording business facts.  The underlying belief is that special reliability is provided by the regularity with which the records are made and kept, as well as the incentive of employees to keep accurate records (under threat of [[Termination of employment|termination]] or other penalty).  The exception functions to allow the record to substitute for the in-court testimony of the employees, but it can only substitute for what the employee could testify about.  The availability of the [[declarant]] (the employee whose testimony is being replaced by the record) is immaterial for the purposes of this exception.

===Reliability of the statements in the record===
It must be apparent to the judge that the record was made in the regular course of business, i.e., that it was customary practice to make such an entry and that the entrant had a duty to record it (either by law or by the terms of his employment).  The record must have been made at or near the time of the act, event, or transaction at issue.  Furthermore, the record must consist of matters either within the personal knowledge of the entrant or within the personal knowledge of someone with a duty to transmit the information to the entrant.

This last point was contested in the case of ''Johnson v. Lutz'', 253 N.Y. 124, 170 N.E. 517 (1930), which held that a business record is admissible only when it is made by an employee about information, obtained by him, from an informant who himself was under a business duty to impart that information.  ''Johnson'' dealt specifically with the admissibility of [[police report]]s, and set a limitation on the use of such reports in court.  Even though the police officer was under a duty to properly record the statements of an [[informant]], the informant himself was under no duty to report the events correctly, and therefore the informant's statement was still inadmissible hearsay.

===Limitation on admissibility of records prepared for litigation===
In the case of ''[[Palmer v. Hoffman]]'', {{ussc|318|109|1943}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that an accident report created by a [[railroad]] company which was prepared in anticipation of a [[lawsuit]] by the victim was inadmissible, because it was not prepared in the regular course of business.  Railroad travel, and not litigation, was the primary business of the railroad, and therefore the report was not considered sufficiently reliable to be admitted into evidence.

==Lack of record as evidence==
FRE 803(7) states the negative counterpart of the business records exception:  the use of the ''lack of a record'' to prove that a transaction or occurrence had not taken place, if it was the regular practice of the business to record such events if they had actually occurred.&lt;ref name="federalevidence.com"/&gt;

==Other types of business records==
Under FRE 803(17), market reports and [[Financial quote|quotations]], directories, and other published compilations are considered generally admissible if they are generally used and relied upon by the public or by persons in particular occupations.  Such information is considered admissible separate and apart from privately made business records described above.

Instead, their parents should be charged the "cost of rectifying their bad behaviour".&lt;ref name="3news.co.nz"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/No-free-lunches-for-hungry-kids-says-Colin-Craig/tabid/1607/articleID/273895/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= 'No free lunches' for hungry kids, says Colin Craig | date=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Craig had 20,000 leaflets delivered to residents in the [[Helensville (New Zealand electorate)|Helensville]] electorate, claiming locals had told him Helensville MP and Prime Minister [[John Key]] was "too gay" to be their representative in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Key-shrugs-off-gay-comments/tabid/1607/articleID/267700/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Key shrugs off gay comments| date=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig has been known to take offence at satirical articles directed at him, including a piece on the satirical website ''[[The Civilian]]'', which he said published a story designed "to make him look ridiculous". He threatened to sue the site unless they published a retraction and paid him $500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Colin-Craig-threatens-satirical-website/tabid/1607/articleID/295333/Default.aspx | work=3 News NZ | title= Colin Craig threatens satirical website| date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig withdrew the threat the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Colin-Craig-abandons-defamation-suit/tabid/1607/articleID/295366/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ |title= Colin Craig abandons defamation suit| date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013 Craig said humans were not to blame for [[climate change]], instead pointing to sunspots and "the circulation of planets".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3news.co.nz/VIDEO-Who-is-Colin-Craig/tabid/1607/articleID/321351/Default.aspx#.UoVj7-HIhnE VIDEO: Who is Colin Craig?].

==Political career==

===March for Democracy===
Craig first emerged as a conservative activist in 2009&lt;ref name="NZH-07-31-11"/&gt; when he organised and funded a "march for democracy" to protest government decisions not to adhere to three [[Referendums in New Zealand|citizen's initiated referenda]]:&lt;ref name=nzhmarch&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/democracy/news/article.cfm?c_id=171&amp;objectid=10605777

===Conservative Party leadership===
In 2011 Craig announced the formation of the [[Conservative Party of New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="NZH-08-04-11"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10742803 |title=Craig no threat to Banks in Epsom, says Brash |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=8 April 2011 |accessdate=29 September 2011 |first1=Hayden |last1=Donnell |first2=Adam

In September 2011, he announced he would stand in the [[Rodney (New Zealand electorate)|Rodney]] electorate for the 2011 general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Conservative Party also gained 2.76% of the vote nationwide, the fifth-largest share of any party and more than four of the parties that actually won seats, but this was insufficient for any Conservatives to enter Parliament because of the 5% of the party vote or one electorate seat required by the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional voting system]] operating in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.org.nz|title=Electoral Commission|website=Electoral Commission|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2015}}

Since the Conservative party's conception, Craig has donated $4 million.

In February 2014, the-then [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] co-leader [[Russel Norman]] alleged that Colin Craig held misogynistic and homophobic attitudes during a speech at the Big Gay Out event in Auckland. Norman's comments prompted Craig to file a defamation suit and to demand that Norman issue an apology.

===2015 leadership dispute===
In June 2015, Colin Craig drew criticism from elements of the Conservative Party when he participated in a [[sauna]] interview hosted by [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] reporter [[David Farrier]], which they felt badly reflected on Craig's public image. The interview was part of the television channel's new Sauna Session current affairs series.&lt;ref name="NZHerald 19 June 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Farrier|first1=David|title=The Sauna Session That May Bring Down Colin Craig|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/tvshows/newsworthy/sauna-session-with-colin-craig-2015060823#axzz3dYJsninl|accessdate=19 June 2015|agency=[[3 News]]|date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following sexual harassment allegations that were published on the right-wing blogger [[Cameron Slater]]'s blog Whale Oil, Craig resigned as party leader on 19 June 2015 and also agreed to "facilitate a review" of the leadership. Craig was also criticised by elements of the Conservative Party for postponing a leadership vote at a scheduled board meeting that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|title=Conservative faction to block Colin Craig's return as leader|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/69559312/conservative-faction-to-block-colin-craigs-return-as-leader|accessdate=19 June 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Slater|first1=Cameron|title=Exclusive: The poem Colin Craig doesn't want you to see|url=http://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2015/06/exclusive-the-poem-colin-craig-doesnt-want-you-to-see/|website=Whale oil|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 2015, Colin Craig announced that he was not ruling out a return to the Conservative Party's leadership if he found sufficient support from the Party's members. He also threatened to sue several media outlets over allegations that he had paid off his former secretary MacGregor over a complaint of sexual harassment to the [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|New Zealand Human Rights Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watkins|first1=Tracey|title=Colin Craig off to lawyers, would consider a Conservative Party comeback|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/69567213/colin-craig-off-to-lawyers-would-consider-a-conservative-party-comeback|accessdate=21 June 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 June, the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' reported that Craig had settled a "financial dispute" with MacGregor for around NZ$16,000 to $17,000 approximately eight weeks earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bilbey|first1=Lynley|title=Colin Craig entangled in money dispute|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11468628|accessdate=21 June 2015|newspaper=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television channel [[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] also reported that there was a serious falling-out between Craig and several Conservative board members. One board member, John Stringer, has accused Craig of lying to the board and other inappropriate behaviour. In response, Craig has denied these allegations and threatened to take action against Stringer for speaking to the media.&lt;ref name="One News 21 June 2015" /&gt;

During the press conference held on 22 June 2015, Craig admitted that he had acted inappropriately towards his press secretary Rachel MacGregor but denied any charges of sexual harassment. In response, MacGregor accused the former Conservative leader for breaching a confidentiality agreement the pair had reached under Human Rights Commission mediation and disputed his version of the events. Craig's wife Helen Craig also announced that she was standing by her husband and characterised the charges against him as "false allegations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig admits 'inappropriate' conduct|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/69601091/colin-craig-admits-inappropriate-conduct|accessdate=22 June 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Factual inaccuracies' - former press secretary speaks out after Colin Craig denies allegations|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/factual-inaccuracies-former-press-secretary-speaks-after-colin-craig-denies-allegations-6343893|accessdate=22 June 2015|agency=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]]|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davison|first1=Isaac|title=Colin Craig is trying to frame me as a mistress|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11469290|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Craig and MacGregor have also denied that they were involved in a romantic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Had you fallen in love with Rachel MacGregor?' - Colin Craig pushed over ex-press secretary|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/had-you-fallen-in-love-rachel-macgregor-colin-craig-pushed-over-ex-press-secretary-6344120|accessdate=23 June 2015|agency=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]]|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|title=Colin Craig's ex-aide denies sexual relationship|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/69601091/colin-craigs-exaide-denies-sexual-relationship|accessdate=23 June 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Craig and MacGregor have also indicated that they would support the lifting of the confidentiality agreement in order to allay uncertainty and speculation.&lt;ref name="Stuff 23 June 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|title=Colin Craig expects 'face-palm moments' ahead|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/69626551/colin-craig-expect-facepalm-moments-ahead|accessdate=23 June 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Herald'', several board members of the Conservative Party including John Stringer, [[Christine Rankin]], and Laurence Day have indicated support for a change of leadership. A board meeting has been scheduled for 27 June 2015 and Day has also called for Craig to be expelled from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davison|first1=Isaac|title=Calls for Colin Craig's party membership to be cancelled|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11469194|accessdate=22 June 2015|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the resignation of six Conservative Party board members, Craig indicated that a new board and a new leader would later be elected by the Party over the weekend. Craig has not ruled out contesting the leadership poll. It is currently unclear whether the dissolution of the board would favor Craig or any other contender for the Conservative Party's leadership.&lt;ref name="Stuff 23 June 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davison|first=Isaac|title=More board members quit Conservative Party|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11469835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June 2015, Colin Craig was formally suspended from the Conservative Party by the party's newly appointed board which consisted of John Stringer and four newly appointed members. Four of the five board members with the exception of Stringer voted to suspend the former Conservative leader's membership. The conference took place in a hotel room at the Heartland Hotel near [[Auckland International Airport]].&lt;ref name="NZH 27 June 2015" /&gt;
According to One News, Craig has since challenged the legality of Stringer and the board's actions; claiming that Stringer had been suspended from the Party. He has also not ruled out contesting the Conservative Party's leadership. Craig's remarks have been dismissed by Stringer, who has become the Party's interim leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig has Conservative Party membership suspended|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/colin-craig-has-conservative-party-membership-suspended-6347983|accessdate=27 June 2015|publisher=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]]|date=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2015, John Stringer resigned his positions as chairman and board member to preserve the neutrality of the second Board so he and Craig could resolve their differences in court separately. According to the ''New Zealand Herald'', a statement by former chairman Brian Dobbs that Stringer had been suspended meant that the decision by the interim board to suspend Colin Craig's membership was invalid.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 5 July 2015" /&gt; It transpired that the "suspension" of Stringer was nothing more than a phone call by Dobbs to Nathaniel Heslop (who had already resigned) and Stringer was never notified of any hearing or meeting being the only other Board member still active. Dobbs then resigned hours later with Stringer not being notified he was 'suspended" until a week later which was ignored. Documents later emerged that Craig had threatened Dobbs with personal liabilities of the party debts and letters flowed from Craig's lawyers to Dobbs. On 7 July, Craig also sent a personal letter to Conservative Party members to apologize for his behaviour and to gauge whether he had sufficient support to return to the Party's leadership.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz 7 July 2015" /&gt; On 29 July 2015, Colin Craig announced that he was going to sue several opponents including Conservative Party member John Stringer, the right wing blogger [[Cameron Slater]] and [[New Zealand Taxpayers' Union]]'s president Jordan Williams for alleged defamation. In addition, Craig also circulated a booklet, entitled "Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas", which he claimed outlined a "campaign of defamatory lies" against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Corazon|last2=Davison|first2=Isaac|title=Colin Craig sues 'dirty politics brigade'|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11488774|accessdate=11 August 2015|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Craig |first=Colin |date=2015 |title=Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas |url=http://votecolincraig.co.nz/documents/Dirty%20Politics.pdf |location=Auckland |publisher=Colin and Helen Craig |agency= |access-date=2015-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925161400/http://votecolincraig.co.nz/documents/Dirty%20Politics.pdf |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 2015, Craig also announced his intention to contest the Auckland mayoral election in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Day|first1=Simon|title=Colin Craig could run for Auckland Mayor|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/70746613/colin-craig-could-run-for-auckland-mayor|accessdate=11 August 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 August 2015, John Stringer lodged a complaint against Colin Craig with the [[New Zealand Police]], alleging that the later had exceeded his allocated election fund legal limit by NZ$2,000 when contesting the East Coast Bays electorate in 2014.  In addition, Stringer criticized Craig's management of the Conservative Party's 2014 election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hutching|first1=Chris|title=Stringer reveals allegations he has taken to the police|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/stringer-reveals-allegations-he-has-taken-police-ch-176899|accessdate=11 August 2015|publisher=''[[National Business Review]]''|date=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Stringer submitted a dossier of documents to both the Police and the [[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Peter|last2=Robson|first2=Sarah|title=Colin Craig documents given to police|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/colin-craig-documents-given-to-police-2015081115#axzz3iY3Nkw7R|accessdate=11 August 2015|agency=3 News|date=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 August 2015, Jordan Williams served proceedings in defamation against Colin Craig and several Conservative Party officials in response to Craig's statements at the July press conference and in the circular ''Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Nicholas|title=Legal action taken against Colin Craig|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11497297|accessdate=16 August 2015|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 2015, Colin Craig filed a defamation suit against the Party's former chairman, John Stringer.

On 7 November 2015, Colin Craig was outed as the anonymous "Mr X" who posed as a party whistleblower that was interviewed in the "Dirty Politics" booklet delivered earlier in July. Despite acknowledging that he had fabricated the interview by posing as the interviewee, he defended his actions on the grounds that "talking about himself" in the third person was a common literary tool. He also stood by his assertions in the "Dirty Politics" booklet and vowed to continue his involvement in the Conservative Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Marika|title=Ex-Conservative leader Colin Craig outed as Mr X|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/73727758/exconservative-leader-colin-craig-outed-as-mr-x|accessdate=8 November 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|publisher=''[[The Sunday Star-Times]]''|date=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 November, Craig announced that he would not contest the Conservative Party's leadership in lieu of a police investigation over his Party's spending during the 2014 general election. However, he also indicated that he would contest the 2017 general elections if he was cleared and if the Party wanted him back.&lt;ref name="NZH 16 Nov 2015" /&gt; On 24 November, it was reported that Craig had demanded that the blogger Cameron Slater pay him NZ$15,000 as compensation for reproducing a poem written for his former press secretary Rachel MacGregor on his blog Whale Oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirk|first1=Stacey|title=Colin Craig claims $15,000 from Whale Oil blogger Cameron Slater for publication of 'Two of Me' poem|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/74343529/colin-craig-claims-15000-from-whale-oil-blogger-cameron-slater-for-publication-of-two-of-me-poem|accessdate=25 November 2015|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 Defamation lawsuit===
On 5 September 2016, Colin Craig appeared in the Auckland High Court to face a defamation lawsuit filed by Taxpayers' Union executive director Jordan Williams. Williams had filed the lawsuit after Craig alleged that Williams lied when he said that Craig had sexually harassed his former press secretary Rachel MacGregor. A jury of seven men and five women were selected for the trial, which is scheduled to take place for five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig in court to defend defamation Action|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/312572/colin-craig-in-court-to-defend-defamation-case|accessdate=6 September 2016|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September, Williams submitted text message correspondence between Craig and MacGregor as evidence of Craig's alleged sexual harassment. Williams has also alleged that Craig had breached a confidentiality agreement with McGregor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Sexual harassment allegations against Colin Craig detailed for first time|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/83944394/colin-craig-called-manipulative-during-defamation-case-against-him|accessdate=6 September 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September 2016, the former Conservative Party deputy [[Christine Rankin]] took the stand to testify in support of Williams' defamation suit. Rankin testified that revelations about Craig's alleged inappropriate relationship with MacGregor had led her to question Craig's suitability to lead the Party. That same day, Williams took the stand to read portions of Craig's poems to MacGregor. He also alleged that Craig's defence team had tried to link him to the ''[[Dirty Politics]]'' scandal by alleging that he had taken part in a smear campaign against the former head of the [[Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand)|Serious Fraud Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Colin Craig allegedly told Christine Rankin his secretary was 'mentally ill'|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/83989754/colin-craigs-alleged-love-letters-read-aloud-to-court|accessdate=8 September 2016|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 September, the judge discharged a juror after he revealed that he had a connection to a witness who was scheduled to give evidence for Craig later in the trial. As a result, the trial would proceed with eleven jurors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Colin Craig defamation trial: Juror discharged|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11705810|accessdate=8 September 2016|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]|date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September, Craig's lawyer Stephen Mills [[Queen's Council|QC]] cross-examined Williams, who admitted that he had never seen the actual "sex text" between Craig and MacGregor. He also presented correspondence between Craig and MacGregor and contended that their relationship was consensual. The following day, Mills continued his cross-examination of Williams and suggested that William's motives for releasing the letters and emails were link to an ulterior motive of removing Craig as Party leader. Williams admitted this was the case but asserted that Craig's alleged inappropriate relationship with MacGregor made him an unsuitable leader for a "Christian movement based on family values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Colin Craig trial: all you need to know|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11706663|accessdate=11 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September, the former Conservative board member John Stringer alleged that Craig was involved romantically with other women besides Rachel MacGregor. He also denied that there was a "dirty politics" strategy against Craig and alleged that Crag had disciplines, harassed, and attacked members that had disagreed with him. In his testimony, Stringer also alleged that Craig had created a "cult-like culture of confidentiality within the Conservative Party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hollingworth|first1=Adam|title=Colin Craig needed chaperone around MacGregor - Stringer|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/nznews/colin-craig-needed-chaperone-around-macgregor---stringer-2016091212|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=Newshub|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 and 15 September, Craig's former press secretary Rachel MacGregor took the stand to testify about Craig's alleged sexual harassment during the three-year period she had spent working as his press secretary. In her testimony, MacGregor cited a disagreement about her pay rate as the final straw in her decision to resign as press secretary two days before the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014 general election]]. In addition, MacGregor admitted that Craig had once fallen asleep on her lap but denied singing Christian hymns to him during that incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Rachel MacGregor's text messages to Colin Craig read to court|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84256582/former-conservative-leader-colin-craig-under-huge-pressure-lawyers-say|accessdate=15 September 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tahana|first1=Yvonne|title=Claims Colin Craig slept on Rachel MacGregor's lap while she sung him hymns|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/claims-colin-craig-slept-rachel-macgregors-lap-while-she-sung-him-hymns|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=One News|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 September, the former Auckland City councillor Aaron Bhatnagar testified in support of Williams. He dismissed Craig's claim that he had supplied the text correspondence between Craig and MacGregor to Williams as false allegations that had damaged his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Former councillor Aaron Bhatnagar: Colin Craig 'impugned my reputation'|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11710269|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the afternoon of 15 September, Colin Craig and his lawyer Stephen Mills began presenting evidence for his defence after Jordan Williams and his team concluded their evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Colin Craig to defend defamation case|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84281588/colin-craig-to-defend-defamation-case|accessdate=15 September 2016|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 September, Craig denied William's allegations that he had sexually harassed MacGregor and likened their relationship to that of siblings. Craig also testified that MacGregor had proposed to marry him but that he had turned her offer down because he was already married. In his testimony, he argued that his rejection of MacGregor's proposition had led her to resign as press secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Did she think I would leave my wife?|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11711164|accessdate=16 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fagans|first1=Josh|title=Colin Craig denies sexual harassment, explicit texts, but admits there was a kiss|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84324546/colin-craig-denies-sexual-harassment-explicit-texts-but-admits-there-was-a-kiss|accessdate=16 September 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September, Craig denied sending any sex text messages to Rachel McGregor but during cross-examination was unable to provide evidence supporting his claim. While hundreds of text messages from MacGregor's phone had been submitted as evidence, Craig's complete phone records have not been supplied to the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Craig can't prove he didn't send messages|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11712720|accessdate=20 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Craig denied that he charged a 29.5% interest rate on MacGregor's loan in order to coerce her into dropping her sexual harassment claim against him. He maintained that he had imposed the interest rate after she had resigned because she had defaulted on a $19,000 loan.&lt;ref name="RNZ 20 Sept"&gt;{{cite news|title=Craig charged 29.5% interest on loan to MacGregor|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/313766/craig-charged-29-point-5-percent-interest-on-loan-to-macgregor|accessdate=20 September 2016|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 September, Craig's wife Helen Craig testified that MacGregor had privately called her to confess that she was having an emotional relationship with Craig. She added that MacGregor had admitted kissing Craig on the night of the 2011 general election. Helen also confirmed that she had forgiven her husband. Helen also testified that she and Craig had drawn up a set of " working rules"  to govern his working relationship.&lt;ref name="RNZ 20 Sept" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Court hears of 'relationship rules' between Rachel MacGregor and Colin Craig|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/84440974/macgregor-took-restraining-order-against-colin-craig-associate|accessdate=20 September 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Craig had admitted kissing McGregor, he denied undressing or having sexual intercouse with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Colin Craig on kiss with press secretary|url=http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11713454|accessdate=20 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September, the investigative journalist [[Nicky Hager]] testified as part of Colin Craig's defense. In his testimony, he alleged that the information that had been released about Colin Craig on blogs like Cameron Slater's Whale Oil matched the patterns he had documented in his book ''[[Dirty Politics]]'', which had inspired Craig's pamphlet "Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Colin Craig defamation trial: Dirty Politics author Nicky Hager takes the stand|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11714115|accessdate=21 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Dobbs, the former chairman of the Conservative Party, also testified that he and several other board members had expressed their discomfort with Craig and MacGregor's relationship. He criticized Craig for proceeding with the a 2015 sauna interview with a journalist without consulting him first. Dobbs also disclosed that Williams had showed him a collection of love letters, poems, emails, and other correspondence between Craig and MacGregor in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig defamation trial: Nicky Hager gives evidence|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/313866/colin-craig-defamation-trial-hager-gives-evidence|accessdate=22 September 2016|publisher=Radio New Zealand|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September, former Conservative Party board member Laurence Day disputed Rachel MacGregor's claim that Colin Craig had sexually harassed her on the grounds that Williams had failed to present the incriminating alleged "sext" text message. He alleged that Williams was trying to use the sexual harassment allegations to turn the party board members against Craig. Meanwhile, [[Family First New Zealand|Family First]] director [[Bob McCoskrie]] described Williams' leak of the alleged sexual harassment allegations as part of an "organized campaign" to unseat Craig. Day and McCoskrie supported Craig's assertion that his relationship with MacGregor had been inappropriate but consensual. McCoskrie defended Craig's pamphlet as a response to the alleged "organized campaign" against Craig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Former Conservative board member says a male secretary wouldn't have flattered Colin Craig|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84531305/family-first-director-bob-mccoskrie-says-colin-craigs-poetry-bad|accessdate=22 September 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September, several Conservative Party staff members testified in Craig's defense. Two staffers Bev Adair-Beets and Angela Storr alleged that MacGregor had tried to exploit her relationship with Craig and disputed her sexual harassment allegations. Another staffer Kevin Stitt vouched for the accuracy of the allegations presented in Craig's "Dirty Politics" pamphlet. The left-wing blogger [[Martyn "Bomber" Bradbury]] also alleged that Williams had embarked on what he described as a "political hit" job against the former Conservative leader. While on the stand, the plaintiff Williams disputed Craig's defense lawyer Stephen Mill's charge that he had used MacGregor for political gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leask|first1=Anna|title=Jordan Williams emotional and angry in court|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11715434|accessdate=23 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September, lawyers for both Jordan Williams and Colin Craig entered closing arguments. William's lawyer Peter Knight argued that the love letters and poems were proof that Williams had not been lying about Craig's alleged sexual harassment against MacGregor. In response, Craig's lawyer Stephen Mills asserted Craig had a right to defend himself through his "Dirty Politics" pamphlet. Mills also contended that Williams had broken MacGregor's trust by passing information on her relationship with Craig to other Conservative Party officials and [[Cameron Slater]]'s blog Whale Oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig trial: 'Jordan Williams wanted leader gone'|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11718475|accessdate=28 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig's lawyer makes final push to clear his name|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/colin-craigs-lawyer-makes-final-push-to-clear-his-name-2016092811|accessdate=28 September 2016|publisher=Newshub|date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September, after ten hours of deliberations, the jury unanimously found Craig guilty on two counts of defamation against Williams. Craig was ordered to pay $1.3 million in compensation and punitive damages to Williams. While Williams and his supporters including Cameron Slater have welcomed the decision, Craig's lawyers have announced that they would be appealing the verdict and challenging the size of the damages awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wade|first1=Amelia|title=Colin Craig loses defamation case, ordered to pay $1.3m damages|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11715326|accessdate=30 September 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bath|first1=Brooke|last2=Dennett|first2=Kelly|title=Colin Craig ruled to have defamed Jordan Williams|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/84790345/colin-craig-jury-returns-in-defamation-case|accessdate=30 September 2016|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historic defamation damages award v Craig appealed ===
On 12 April 2017, High Court Justice Katz ruled that the compensation damages of $1.27 million constituted a "miscarriage of justice". The decision was welcomed by Colin Craig as a vindication of his assertion that he was responding to attacks on his character by Jordan Williams however the judge's decision related only to the amount of damages awarded to Williams against Craig by the jury not their verdict that Williams had been defamed by Craig which stood.

Justice Katz indicated that the two parties had until 26 April 2017 to consent to the High Court substituting its own award or setting aside the earlier verdict and ordering a retrial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=$1.27m Colin Craig defamation damages ruled excessive|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/328704/$1-point-27m-colin-craig-defamation-damages-ruled-excessive|accessdate=13 April 2017|agency=Radio New Zealand|date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Verdict may be set aside in Colin Craig v Jordan Williams defamation case|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11837168|accessdate=13 April 2017|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Williams filed an appeal of the Katz decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11847282|title=Jordan Williams appeals to try to avoid retrial in Colin Craig defamation case|website=NZ Herald|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colin Craig did not file an acceptance of this action by 26 April actioning an inevitable re-trial however Jordan Williams then filed an appeal of the judge's decision seeking the jury damages award in his favour stand.  He released a press statement late April saying "Colin Craig argued that the jury's damages award was too high. The judge agreed but the High Court is only able to reset the damages if both parties agree...I don't want Rachel MacGregor or my mother or any other of my witnesses to have to go through it all again. The jury made clear findings. At every stage Mr Craig has wanted to stretch things out. We have no assurance he would not appeal after a new trial...So an appeal now could get to the key issues directly. It is the best way forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-nz/news/national/williams-appeals-in-craig-defamation-case/ar-BBAsUHO|title=Williams appeals in Craig defamation case|website=www.msn.com|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human Rights Review Tribunal record damages awarded against Craig ===
On 3 October, it was reported that the  Human Rights Review Tribunal had, earlier in 2016, ordered Craig to pay Rachel MacGregor $128,780 in compensation for breaching the non-disclosure agreement with MacGregor by giving interviews about her. Because of the Williams defamation trial, the decision had been covered by blanket suppression until after the Williams v Craig verdict.

As of 2016, this amounts to the highest amount awarded by the Human Rights Review Tribunal.  In addition, Craig paid MacGregor $100,000 relating to her legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Rachel MacGregor awarded $128k after Colin Craig breaches confidentiality|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/84900004/rachel-macgregor-awarded-damages-after-colin-craig-breached-confidentiality|accessdate=4 October 2016|agency=Stuff.co.nz|date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent developments===
On 4 October, the Conservative Party's board chairman Leighton Baker (confirmed as new leader of the party on 24 January 2017&lt;ref&gt;Conservative Party website press release 24 Jan 2017&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed that Colin Craig had resigned his membership and was not holding any positions in the party. However, Craig has not ruled out playing a role with the Conservatives after his legal problems were resolved.&lt;ref&gt;4 October 2016 Newshub and Paul Henry Breakfast&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 December 2016, Craig won his bid for his upcoming defamation case against former Party official John Stringer to be heard before a judge rather than a jury&lt;ref&gt;Conservative Party doesn't want Colin Craig back|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/conservative-party-doesnt-want-colin-craig-back-2016100407|accessdate=6 October 2016|publisher=Newshub|date=6 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as with the Williams case which Craig lost with historic damages. The ''Craig v Stringer'' case had been scheduled to be heard in the Christchurch High Court before Justice Gendall for a three-week period on 6 March 2017 (''Craig v Stringer''). In late 2016 John Stringer succeeded before Justice Nation in having granted on application a Judicial Settlement Conference under r7:79 in Christchurch, at which on 30 January 2017 Craig and Stringer settled their differences and the case against Stringer was dropped. No money exchanged hands and the settlement was sealed by the court and will not be released.&lt;ref&gt;The Press/STUFF Adele Redmond 6:42pm 1 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 2016, Judge Mary Beth Sharp of the Auckland District Court dismissed both of Craig's copyright lawsuits against Cameron Slater and Jordan Williams over the publication of Craig's poem ''Two of Me'' calling the claims "vexatious" and "improper" and a "deception perpetrated on the court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennett|first1=Kelly|title=Colin Craig's latest lawsuit thrown out; called vexatious|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/87263343/colin-craigs-latest-lawsuit-thrown-out-called-vexatious|accessdate=7 December 2016|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April 2017, Colin Craig filed a $240,000 lawsuit against former employee Jacqueline Stiekema regarding defamatory statements she had allegedly made on a [[Facebook]] page and other defamatory publications she had made to a third person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Craig suing again|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2017/04/colin-craig-suing-again.html|accessdate=13 April 2017|agency=Newshub|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 March 2017 Associate Judge Bell transferred the application to strike out the case to the district court.&lt;ref&gt;High Court decisions.

===2017 defamation trials===
Craig and blogger Cameron Slater both sued each other for defamation following the 2014 election. The cases were held in May 2017 and Craig represented himself in the four week trial. The Judge reserved his decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/93193627/closing-submissions-heard-in-colin-craig-defamation-trial|title=Closing submissions heard in Colin Craig defamation trial|website=Stuff|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Braunias |first1=Steve |title=Craig v Slater: The end of the affair |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11868133 |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

8 May - 1 June 2017 the Craig v Slater (and Slater v Craig counterclaim) CIV2015-404-1923 was heard in the Auckland High Court before Justice Toogood.  Slater was represented by Brian Henry and Craig represented himself. The trial went a week past its scheduled three weeks. Craig said the case came down to credibility and whom the judge believed was telling the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2017/06/craig-v-slater-day-17-media-roundup/|title=Craig v Slater Day 17 (media roundup) – Whale Oil Beef Hooked - Whaleoil Media|date=1 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slater sued Craig for alleged defamatory statements in his booklet "Dirty Politics &amp; Hidden Agendas" (2015) and Craig sued Slater for making alleged defamatory statements on his blog. These included that Craig: had sexually harassed Rachel MacGregor; lied about it; and covered it up after settling a sexual harassment hearing in the Human Rights Commission and then the Human Rights Review Tribunal; and that there was a "second woman".

It dramatically transpired during the trial that Slater had been rung by a barrister that he knew (and whose identity vocation and area of practice he had chosen to keep anonymous) was in fact working for Colin Craig. There was disagreement over phone calls on 24 and 25 June 2015 initiated by the barrister and allegedly by Mr Craig which left Slater with an inference the barrister (a sexual harassment specialist) was representing a "second victim" with whom "Craig was a factor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2017/06/craig-v-slater-final-media-roundup-now/|title=Craig v Slater final media roundup... for now – Whale Oil Beef Hooked - Whaleoil Media|date=2 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither the barrister nor Craig ever revealed the conflict of interest nor did Craig correct Slater's inference at any stage leading up to and during most of the trial (the "second woman" was a central factor in both the earlier ''Craig v Stringer'' and ''Williams v Craig'' proceedings based on that evidence). Craig instead chose to sue all three parties for this contention which he knew was false yet allowed Slater to infer without correction until the much later trial.

The judge reserved his decision on 1 June 2017 to be delivered "as quickly as possible."

The Slater trial was the second in a triumvirate of trials central to a cluster of ancillary proceedings involving Craig (in the District Court; in hearings; in tribunals; and with the police; the Privacy Commission and the Electoral Commission all based on independent complaints). The main three trials (all filed 2015) concern the so-called "Dirty Politics Brigade" (Jordan Williams; Cameron Slater; John Stringer)  alleged in the Craig's booklet "Dirty Politics &amp; Hidden Agendas (2015) named after the Hager book "Dirty Politics" (2014). The Williams trial concluded 30 September 2016; the Slater-Craig trials 1 June 2017; and Stringer v Craig &amp; Others CIV2015-404-2524 is anticipated later in 2017 which will be the largest of the three. The latter has six defendants including Helen Craig but one of the defendants (a lawyer) settled with John Stringer in May 2016. Stringer and Craig also settled "Craig v Stringer" (CIV2015-409-0575) on 30 January 2017 in the Christchurch high court for zero an unrelated but parallel proceeding to the three main trials which largely concern the same issues and the same people.

On 9 June, it was reported that Colin Craig had filed a lawsuit against his former press secretary Rachel MacGregor.

On Friday 1 September 2017 Judge Harrison delivered a second strike-out of a Craig defamation suit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/338504/colin-craig-ordered-to-pay-17k-in-costs-to-woman-he-tried-to-sue&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/95304867/judge-throws-out-colin-craigs-bid-to-sue-former-employee-for-defamation&lt;/ref&gt;

In the judges' four page decision Craig was ordered to pay Mrs Jacky Stiekema [Craig v Stiekema Civ2915-404-002882] $17600 in costs following his earlier refusal to discontinue what was described as frivolous litigation [para 12 of the decision] against her by senior barrister Peter McKnight of Wellington firm Langford Law. In the Stiekema case it was concluded Craig sought to obtain emails (that did not exist) between John Stringer (see above) and Mrs Stiekema for ulterior purposes (so Craig could use any material discovered against Stringer elsewhere); ruled a "[[fishing expedition]]" in relation to Craig by Associate Judge Osborne in the Christchurch High Court in yet another Craig proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defamationupdate.co.nz/sites/all/pdf/2016/Craig-v-Stringer-2016-NZHC-768.pdf See para 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Judge Harrison decision followed an earlier decision in Wellington by Judge Sharp in December 2016 to strike-out Craig's litigation Craig v Social Media Ltd and Jordan Williams described as "vexatious," "malicious" and "a deception on the court."  In both instances Craig is appealing the judgements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.districtcourts.govt.nz/assets/unsecure/2017-05-08/2017-NZDC-2366-Colin-Craig-v-Social-Media-Consultants-Ltd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; View the full judgement here.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.districtcourts.govt.nz/all-judgments/2016-nzdc-24911-craig-v-social-media-consultants-ltd/&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacky Stiekema (described in blog posts by Stringer as "Grandma Quilts" to protect her privacy&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldnews.indywatch.org/archiver/worldnews.indywatch.org/resources/timemachine/2015/329/pacific.html See 14:01]&lt;/ref&gt; because she makes quilts and is a grandmother) was an ex-employee of Craig's (a senior Trust Account Manager of several years at Centurion) and had years earlier (2012) successfully taken Craig to the Employment Court for which she was awarded several thousand dollars. It was felt in some quarters that perhaps the more recent litigation was in retaliation for this as it appeared difficult to ascertain Craig's motivation for suing Stiekema and that he had failed "to disclose a serious tort".&lt;ref&gt;see 6 of Harrison 1 September 2017 ref ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of Stiekema's 2012 Employment Court hearing the first negative media publicity emerged about Craig with references in the media to Craig explaining "shortness" being due to "sin" (with biblical allusions to Zaccheus the tax collector) and Stiekema's uncomfortableness with "prayer meetings" run by Craig at the business despite Stiekema's strong personal Christian faith (see STUFF report &lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/6876016/Colin-Craig-preached-shortness-a-sin-claim&lt;/ref&gt; which followed years later with the saga detailed above and claims in the media "NZ women are the most promiscuous in the world" during the 2014 election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/kiwi-women-most-promiscuous--colin-craig-2012050911&lt;/ref&gt;

===New litigation, 2017&amp;ndash;2018===
In late 2017 Craig was facing additional strike-out applications including a recall and possible strikeout of his Christchurch high court case against John Stringer (mid-October 2017; that was settled by Stringer in January 2017 for zero), still to be heard. He is involved in multiple proceedings including a new suit announced against his former sexual harassment complainant Rachel MacGregor and a counter suit from her against Craig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Satherley |first1=Dan |title=Colin Craig sues ex-press secretary Rachel MacGregor |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2017/06/colin-craig-sues-ex-press-secretary-rachel-macgregor.html |accessdate=24 October 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nzherald.co.nz"/&gt;

On 24 September 2018, Craig dropped his damages claim against MacGregor but stated that he was still pursuing his defamation claim against his former press secretary. MacGregor has also pursued a defamation claim against hwe former employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Warhurst |first1=Lucy |title=Colin Craig drops damages claim, but presses ahead with suit against Rachel MacGregor |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/09/colin-craig-drops-damages-claim-but-presses-ahead-with-suit-against-rachel-macgregor.html |accessdate=24 October 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October, Auckland High Court Judge Kit Toogood ruled that Craig had committed "moderately serious sexual harassment" against MacGregor. He also ruled that Cameron Slater had defamed Craig in five untrue statements but declined to award damages, stating that "the reputational damage which Mr Craig suffered throughout the events traversed at length in this judgment resulted almost entirely from his own actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Satherley |first1=Dan |title=Colin Craig 'guilty of moderately serious sexual harassment' against Rachel MacGregor, judge rules |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/10/colin-craig-guilty-of-moderately-serious-sexual-harassment-against-rachel-macgregor-judge-rules.html |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hurley |first1=Sam |title=Judge rules Cameron Slater defamed Colin Craig who sexually harassed Rachel MacGregor |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12148439 |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Livingston |first1=Tommy |title=Colin Craig defamed by Cameron Slater, but also found 'guilty' of sexual harassment |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/108071391/colin-craig-defamed-by-cameron-slater-but-also-found-guilty-of-sexual-harassment |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Converting companies''' are companies that specialize in combining raw materials such as [[polyester]]s, adhesives, [[silicone]], [[adhesive tape]]s, foams, plastics, felts, rubbers, liners and metals, as well as other materials, to create new products.

Materials such as [[paper]], [[plastic film]], foil and cloth often are produced in long, continuous sheets that are rolled up for more convenient handling and transportation.  These rolls of material vary significantly in size and weight — ranging from {{convert|2|-|203|inch|cm|0}} wide and weighing as much as several tons. The converting industry takes these continuous rolls of thin, flat materials — known as webs — threads them through processing machines (such as printing presses, laminating, coating and slitting machines) and converts or changes the web of material into an intermediate form or final product.  For example, a converter’s equipment might take a web of plastic film, cut it into lengths, and fuse their edges, thus converting it into plastic bags.  This activity is known as web processing.

==Processes==
Typical converting processes are coating, laminating and printing. [[Coating]] technologies can include hot melt coating, gravure coating, [[curtain coating]] and slot-die coating. The most common printing techniques are [[flexo]] printing and [[rotogravure]] (gravure) printing. Both print processes are suited to high speed roll-to-roll processing.

Many converting companies will process large diameter, wide rolls of material as this increases the converting efficiency by minimising changes. On completion of the converting process the rolls may be cut into smaller rolls on a [[roll slitting|slitting machine]]. These rolls are then a convenient size for handling on packaging and other machines.  Alternatively, the rolls may be sheeted-cut into sheets — as happens in newspaper and book printing.  Further processes such as collation may occur after sheeting.

==Web alignment==
Web alignment is an important part of a converting operation as a moving web of material has a tendency to track off course and wander out of alignment during the converting processes. To avoid these problems, engineers have developed a variety of automatic web-guiding systems that assure production accuracy and reduce waste. Web-guiding systems typically are positioned just before a critical stage on a converting machine (for example, just before a print station on a printing press).

Each type of [[Web-guiding systems|web guiding system]] uses a sensor to monitor the web position for lateral tracking, and each has an actuator to shift the running web mechanically back on course whenever the sensor detects movement away from the set path. Actuators may be pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, or some kind of electromechanical device. Because the web may be fragile — particularly at its edge — non-contact sensors are used.  These sensors may be [[Pneumatic web guides|pneumatic]], photoelectric, ultrasonic, or infrared. The system’s controls must put the output signals from the sensors in to a form that can drive the actuator. Many controls today are electronic, typically using an amplifier to convert signals from the sensor, then commanding a special servo motor incorporating a lead or ball screw for guiding actuation. The latest web guiding systems have touch screen controls to simplify the setup procedure. Some web guiding systems have been designed specifically for the converting industry.

==Services==
Many converters specialize in 
* Adhesive coating to make [[labels]] and [[adhesive tape]]
* Silicone coating to make a [[release liner]]
* [[Die (manufacturing)|Die]]-cutting materials into finished parts or labels
* Printing services
* [[Roll slitting]] of wide webs into narrow webs or coils
* Laminating services
* [[Vacuum forming]]

==Newer technology==
Some converting companies now incorporate electronics in their finished products.  For example, converters producing [[RFID]] stock labels must incorporate RFID chips and antenna inlays.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.abgint.com/news_archive/05_apr_rfid_converter.html Description of an RFID upgrade at a conversion company] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131016043335/http://www.abgint.com/news_archive/05_apr_rfid_converter.html |date=2013-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The electronic components make up the [[RFID tag]].  The tag stores the information about the items that have been tagged.  These converters therefore sometimes incorporate volume electronics manufacturing practices including controlling static electricity, electronic manufacturing test and similar processes.  Solving some of the issues of inclusion of materials sensitive to external influences has led to more tech companies embracing roll-based manufacturing processes, with particular success in the lithium ion and solar cell manufacturing sectors.&lt;ref name="lithium"&gt;[http://www.universalconvertingequipment.com/lithium-ion-and-solar-cell-manufacturers-increasingly-embracing-web-processes Lithium ion and solar cell manufacturers increasingly embracing converter web processes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paper converting==
{{advert|date=January 2018}}
The process of processing pre-cut cartons or "blanks" and folding them into the appropriate shape to become finished packaging containers is known as tray forming or carton erecting. These machines can create, for example, nacho trays, chinese noodle soup boxes, pizza boxes, french fry trays, hamburger clamshells, etc.

Those assertions however were proven wrong by all the probes, whose subject was the MP. The results of the last probe, which was conducted by the Counter-Corruption and Unlawful Assets Forfeiture Commission (KPKONPI), were presented June 14 and cleared Delyan Peevski of all suspicions, raised against him by his enemies and opponents, Bulgarian News Agency reported.&lt;ref name="kpkonpi"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bta.bg/en/c/ES/id/1819451 |title=Anti-Corruption Commission Clears MP Delyan Peevski of Conflict of Interest, Tax Evasion Suspicions |date=2018-06-14 |website=BULGARIAN NEWS AGENCY |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621143309/http://www.bta.bg/en/c/ES/id/1819451 | archive-date=2018-06-21 |access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the results' basis, Plamen Georguiev, chairman of KPKONPI, declared Peevski a "model citizen" due to the fact that he has been under scrutiny for more than a decade and all the probes only showed that he committed no violations. Mr. Peevski is one of the biggest taxpayers in this country, Plamen Georguiev stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://btvnovinite.bg/bulgaria/antikorupcionnoto-zveno-deljan-peevski-e-spazval-zakonite-prez-poslednite-15-g.html |title=Антикорупционното звено: Делян Пеевски е спазвал законите през последните 15 г. |last=Racheva |first=Kanna |date=2018-06-14 |website=bTV Новините |access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Peevski graduated from 119 SOU in [[Sofia]] in 1998 and completed his legal studies at the [[South-West University "Neofit Rilski"|South-West University]] in 2003. His university diploma is subject to dispute.{{sfn|Lilov|2013|p=221}}

== Political career ==
In 2001, Peevski joined the [[National Movement for Stability and Progress|National Movement Simeon II (NMSII)]]. In 2007, he was fired as a deputy minister during the Socialist-led government in a corruption scandal. He was investigated, but the investigation was dropped and he was given his job back.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-government-idUSBRE95D0ML20130614|title=Bulgarians protests over media magnate as security chief|last=Tsolova|first=Tsvetelia|date=2017-06-14|work=|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2017-01-31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Peevski was elected President of the [[State Agency for National Security]], with the votes of 116 MPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2013/06/14/2081376_za_15_minuti_parlamentut_izbra_delian_peevski_za_shef/ It took just 15 minutes for Parliament to decide that Peevski should be head of the State Agency "National Security"]&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Bulgarians gathered in front of government headquarters in Sofia to protest Peevski's appointment, chanting "Mafia" and "resign."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Under the pressure of the [[2013–14 Bulgarian protests against the Oresharski cabinet|protests against the Oresharski cabinet]] that followed, Parliament unanimously revised its decision later the same month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fakti.bg/bulgaria/69578-ima-kvorum-za-reshavane-na-kazusa-peevski Peevski is no longer boss of the State Agency "National Security"]&lt;/ref&gt; After a couple of months of lack of clarity whether under these conditions Peevski was still considered an MP or not, eventually in December 2013 the Constitutional Court decided that he still was an MP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapool.bg/konstitutsionniyat-sad-betonira-deputatskiya-mandat-na-delyan-peevski-news214911.html Constitutional Court decides that Peevski is MP]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Peevski was elected to the [[European Parliament]] on the MRF ticket,&lt;ref&gt;[http://results.cik.bg/ep2014/rezultati/ Резултати от избори за Европейски парламент 25.05.2014 г. за страната]&lt;/ref&gt; but immediately thereafter decided to give up his seat. He explained that his motivation to participate in the European elections, while not taking his seat, had been to restore his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapool.bg/praven-kazus-v-tsik-okolo-otkazite-na-peevski-i-stanishev-ot-ep-news220867.html Правен казус в ЦИК около отказите на Пеевски и Станишев от ЕП]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnevnik.bg/izbori2014/2014/05/30/2312010_cik_obiavi_17-te_izbrani_evrodeputati_peevski_e/ ЦИК обяви 17-те избрани евродепутати, Пеевски е заличен от листата на ДПС]&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid June 2014, three people were arrested due to their involvement in an alleged murder plot against Peevski, but they were eventually released because of a lack of sufficient evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapool.bg/sadat-pusna-na-svoboda-trimata-mazhe-gotvili-pokushenie-sreshtu-peevski-news221494.html Съдът пусна на свобода тримата мъже, "готвили покушение" срещу Пеевски, магистратите взеха решението си в болницата, където от снощи лежи единият от обвинените]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapool.bg/peevski-ako-byah-nachalnik-na-sadebnata-vlast-ubiytsite-mi-nyamashe-da-sa-na-svoboda-news221543.html Пеевски: ако бях началник на съдебната власт, убийците ми нямаше да са на свобода. Депутатът от ДПС бе разпитан по сигнала на "Протестна мрежа" и за готвеното му покушение]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary activity===
As a member of the Bulgarian National Assembly he moved together with another two MPs from the parliamentary group of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms - Yordan Tsonev and Hamid Hamid, amendments to the Bank Insolvency Act. The amendments, which are related to Corpbank (KTB), were conclusively adopted in February, 2018, Bulgarian News Agency reported. According to the movers' reasons, the idea of the amendments is to establish an effective mechanism for replenishing a bankrupt bank's bankruptcy estate and to suppress schemes for plundering assets purchased directly or indirectly on money originating from such a bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bta.bg/en/c/DF/id/1741975 |title=Parliament Conclusively Amends Bank Bankruptcy Act |date=2018-02-09 |work=BTA |access-date=2018-03-23 |language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of Bulgaria, [[Rumen Radev]] has put a veto on the amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://seenews.com/news/bulgarian-president-vetoes-changes-to-bank-insolvency-act-602546 |title=Bulgarian president vetoes changes to Bank Insolvency Act. |website=seenews.com |language=en |access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His veto was later overturned by the MPs and the amendments were conclusively adopted by the Parliament on 7 March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.focus-fen.net/news/2018/03/07/428376/mps-override-presidential-veto-on-amendments-to-bankruptcy-law.html |title=MPs override presidential veto on amendments to bankruptcy law |website=FOCUS Information Agency |language=bg |access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those were second amendments, filed by Peevski and his colleagues from the Parliamentary group of MRF, with reference to the so-called "KTB case" and unveiling the truth about the embezzlement of the bank by its majority shareholder Tzvetan Vassilev. In 2016 the MP together with two more members of the same parliamentary group - Yordan Tzonev and the former minister of finances Peter Chobanov, moved urgent amendment to the Bank Insolvency Act in order to allow the publicizing of the report of AlixPartners Services UK LLP, which was contracted to trace and take action for the preservation and recovery of the assets of the failed Corporate Commercial Bank (KTB), Bulgarian News Agency reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bta.bg/en/c/DF/id/1276571 |title=Three Oppossition Movement for Rights and Freedoms MPs Table Urgent Amendments to Bank Bankruptcy Act to Allow Publicizing of Report on Fail |date=2018-02-19 |work=BTA |access-date=2018-03-23 |language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the amendments were adopted, the report was translated in Bulgarian and published in May, 2016. According to the document, the audit confirmed that the bank functioned as a financial pyramid and was siphoned off through large loans to companies related to the majority shareholder Tzvetan Vassilev. More than half of the loans at the value of 2,5 billion BGN were given to companies related to Vassilev. The report also shows that the majority shareholder also used the bank for "personal transactions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bnt.bg/en/a/the-report-by-alixpartners-on-corpbank-published-in-bulgarian |title=THE REPORT BY ALIXPARTNERS ON CORPBANK PUBLISHED IN BULGARIAN | date=2016-05-04 |work=BNT |access-date=2018-03-23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, Parliament approved in principle other amendments, moved by Peevski and his colleagues Yordan Tzonev, Hamid Hamid and Velislava Krusteva, Bulgarian News Agency reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bta.bg/en/c/NW/id/1831364 |title=Parliament Supports in Principle MRF Bill on Disclosure of Real Owners and Financing of Media Organizations |date=2018-07-04 |website=BULGARIAN NEWS AGENCY |language=en-EN |access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new bill is on the disclosure of real owners and financing of media organizations. Authors stated that the amendments aim to bring full transparency on the media sector now having problems with online media outlets, whose owners and financing are unknown. And to show whether or not this is a monopolist market. Yet, the opponents of the amendments stated that the bill attacks Delyan Peesvki's rivals because it requires disclosure of all sources of financing of media organizations other than the proceeds from advertising and bank loans. The opponents of the bill state that "it is aimed against the opposition-minded news media, which use financing from non-government organizations and foreign grants". The day after bill's approval, Peevski, Hamid, Tzonev and Krusteva moved additional amendments requiring disclosure of bank loans and advertising incomes as well in order to meet the expectations of society. Yet the bill is still under attacks by its opponents.

Peevski has the lowest attendance in the current parliament. He appeared in only one plenary session so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://fakti.bg/bulgaria/277493-nai-neredovnite-narodni-predstaviteli |title=Най-нередовните народни представители |website=Fakti.bg - Да извадим фактите наяве |access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in Corporate Commercial Bank closure===
In June 2014, a panic caused a run on Corporate Commercial Bank ("CorpBank") in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2015/10/05/bulgarias-failed-corpbank-the-former-owners-story/#37ceb9b47e79|title=Bulgaria's Failed Corpbank: The Former Owner's Story|last=Coppola|first=Frances|date=2015-10-05|work=|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-01-31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Politico'', the panic "appears to have been triggered when Delyan Peevski … pulled out massive amounts of money from Corporate Commercial Bank."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/bulgaria-calls-early-election/|title=Bulgaria calls early election|date=2014-07-03|newspaper=POLITICO|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The run resulted in the bank being taken over by the Bulgaria National Bank. At the time media reports said that the bank's closing was due to a dispute between bank owner Vassilev and Peevski. Vassilev told a ''Forbes'' reporter, "Delyan Peevski is simply one of the main tools that the Bulgarian political mafia uses to blackmail Bulgarian business—the visible part of a rather large iceberg of corruption."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Vassilev said that the political mafia had tried to "downgrade what happened to Corpbank to a personal conflict between Mr. Peevski and me, which is utterly untrue."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "The claim that I had tried to organize Mr. Peevski's murder was subsequently disproved in court, but it was too late—more than 20% of CorpBank's assets were withdrawn in cash in the span of 4 days," Vassilev said.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
At the same time the above-mentioned report of AlixPartners - the company, which was hired to trace the assets of the bank, shows that the reason Corpbank (KTB) bankrupted was that it had been functioning for years as a financial pyramid. The report says that KTB was siphoned off through large loans to companies related to the majority shareholder Tzvetan Vassilev. More than half of the loans at the value of 2,5 billion BGN were given to companies related to Vassilev. The report also shows that the majority shareholder also used the bank for “personal transactions”. 243 corporate clients of the bank had 472 outstanding loans. These loans, according to the auditors, are unlikely to be recovered, because they were given to non-functioning enterprises or had little collateral, the Bulgarian National TV reported.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bnt.bg/en/a/the-report-by-alixpartners-on-corpbank-published-in-bulgarian&lt;/ref&gt;

The run on CorpBank coincided with a run on another bank, First Investment Bank ("FI Bank"). Media reports and social media messages helped cause the run on both banks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the Bulgaria National Bank shut down CorpBank while keeping Fi Bank open with emergency liquidity. According to Nikolay Staykov of the Bulgarian Protest Network, CorpBank was brought down by the government in order to remove Vassilev, while the government protected FI Bank—the bank that Peevski moved his money into.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2014/08/18/the-bulgarian-banking-disaster/#7a0ef15d9ae6|title=The Bulgarian Banking Disaster|last=Coppola|first=Frances|date=2014-08-18|work=|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-01-31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian judicial system has a reputation for corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Valentina Pop |title=Corruption in Bulgaria and Romania still unpunished, EU says |date=20 July 2011 |url=https://euobserver.com/news/32643 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Forbes'',&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "The removal of Vassilev from the scene leaves Peevski in effective control not only of Bulgarian media and secret services, but of its banking sector too. Such concentration of power is a cause for concern in a supposedly democratic country."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Media and business empire ==

As of 2013, Peevski's media empire controlled six of the 12 largest circulating newspapers. It also had a monopoly on newspaper distribution and digital TV channels.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/09/bulgaria|title=Breaking up with Peevski|date=2013-09-20|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, according to Radio Bulgaria, the number of newspapers he owned increased to more than 20.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bnr.bg/en/post/100673145/smoke-billowing-from-delyan-peevskis-business-empire|title=Smoke billowing from Delyan Peevski’s business empire|last=Daynova|first=Milena|date=2016-03-24|work=Radio Bulgaria|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Peevski also owned several construction companies and was the owner of [[Bulgartabac]], the biggest manufacturer and seller of [[tobacco]] and related products.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; “The Turkish Financial Crime Investigation Board (MASAK) and the Turkish Ministry of Customs and Trade on their part accused Bulgartabac of being one of the biggest cigarette-[[smuggling]] entities in Turkey and of being closely allied to the banned [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|Kurdistan Workers’ Party]], the PKK, which is on the European list of [[Terrorism|terrorist]] organizations,” according to [[Radio Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In early 2016, Peevski published a letter to the media where he said he would no longer start any new business projects in Bulgaria. He said his decision was due to an "ongoing 'smear' campaign" and political pressure.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In an analysis, Radio Bulgaria said it was difficult to pinpoint why Peevski was downsizing his business empire. However, they wrote:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Still, some analysts say there is a connection between the shocks tearing across the Peevski conglomerate and the bankruptcy, two years ago, of the Corporate Commercial Bank with majority owner, Peevksi's own former business partner and friend Tsvetan Vasilev. There is ample evidence that it was precisely the crediting from that bank that helped Delyan Peevksi build his media empire, stone by stone, an empire that has been putting out tentacles into many other economic sectors and spheres. But the cheap (free?) financing is now gone and the media market is not particularly lucrative."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Richter was born in [[Ecséd]], [[Hungary]], but due to the death of his parents, from 1873 he grew up in [[Gyöngyös]]. From 1890 he worked there as a trainee pharmacist. In 1895 Richter completed his degree in [[pharmacology]] with a high mark at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|Budapest University]]. Two years later, he travelled to several European pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies, studying their drug manufacturing methods. In 1901 he bought the pharmacy named as the ''Eagle'' at the corner on the [[Üllői út|Üllői Road]] and Márton Street in [[Budapest]], producing organo-therapeutic drugs. In 1907, in [[Kőbánya]], on 63 Cserkesz Street, he built, and took charge of, the first pharmaceutical factory in Hungary. The factory had its first major success with a kind of [[Aspirin]] called ''Kalmopyrin'', and the disinfectant [[hydrogen peroxide]] in tablets called ''Hyperol'', which were patented in 1912 and went on to play an important role in the [[World War I]]. Before the war, he already had 24 pharmaceutical patents.

== World War 2 ==
By the start of [[World War II]], his pharmaceutical network had representatives on five continents, with 10 subsidiaries and in 34 states with commission repositories.

In 1942, he was stripped from his position as director (due to anti-Semitic laws), and banned from his factory. Then he managed the company from his home with the staff he trusted. In the autumn of 1944 the factory activity was almost completely paralyzed. Even though he had the opportunity to leave Budapest and move to Switzerland, he did not want to leave the company. His wife and himself were hidden by [[Raoul Wallenberg]] with more than a thousand other Jews. After being caught, Richter was murdered by the Hungarian "nyilas" [[Nationalsocialism|national socialists]] ([[Arrow Cross Party]]) in December 1944, along with others shot, and thrown into the ice cold [[Danube]].

== Impact ==
After the war, the factory was rebuilt under the name of [[Gedeon Richter Plc.|Richter Pharmaceutical Factory]] in [[Kőbánya]]. In 1972, on the 100th anniversary of Richter's birth, a commemorative medal was struck, and a memorial plaque was added to the ''Eagle'' pharmacy.

Richter made the first organo-therapeutic composition for raising blood pressure, an adrenal hormone extract ([[adrenaline]]), and the ''Kalmopyrin'' and the [[Tonogen]] suprarenale which are all still used in medicine.

His family house now operates as a school, under the name ''Richter Gedeon Elementary School'' in [[Ecséd]]. The room in which he was born functions as a gym today.

==Personal life==
In 1902 he married to Anna Winkler, the daughter of a timber manufacturer of [[Szeged]], [[Hungary]]. The couple's only son, László was born in 1903. He studied chemistry at the [[ETH Zurich]] and followed his father's footsteps in the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.richter.hu/en-US/about-us/Documents/Tortenelmi%20uzletemberek_angol.pdf Lajos Pillich, István Chladek - Historical businessmen: Gedeon Richter]&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents were practicing Jews, but László converted to the Christian faith of his bride, Ilona Lobmayer, before their marriage in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hdke.hu/files/csatolmanyok/Richter_Gedeon_UrbanBalazs.pdf Balázs Urbán - Családi örökségből világhírű vállalat: Richter Gedeon, a gyógyszergyáros]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grievance Redressal System''' is a mechanism to receive and act on complaints and [[grievance]]s reported by customers of a private organization or public citizens accessing a government (G2C) service.

[[Grievance Redressal]] may be handled directly by organizations through their own [[website]]s or through call centers.  A new innovation is smart [[web portal]]s for grievance processing, connecting customers and action-takers directly through ICT media such as [[Short messaging service|SMS]] and [[email]].

Left to right: Cameron Robertson and Todd Reichert, AeroVelo; Mark Miller, Sikorsky Aircraft Corp; Mike Hirschberg, AHS International.]]
The '''Igor I. Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter Competition''' was established in 1980 by the [[American Helicopter Society (AHS) International]]. The award, the AHS Sikorsky Prize, was given for the first [[human powered helicopter]] (HPH) to meet a set of extremely challenging flight requirements. In summary, the requirements to win the AHS Sikorsky Prize included a flight duration of 60 seconds and reaching an altitude of {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, with the center point of the aircraft hovering over a {{convert|10|by|10|m|ft|adj=on}} square.&lt;ref&gt;AHS International, [http://vtol.org/awards-and-contests/human-powered-helicopter/hph-rules Human Powered Helicopter Regulations], retrieved July 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, 33 years after the competition was established, the award was officially declared won when AeroVelo's [[AeroVelo Atlas|Atlas]] human-powered helicopter conducted a flight that met all the requirements of the AHS International competition, and received the $250,000 prize.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the history of the prize, dozens of teams have designed and built human-powered helicopters, although few have made it airborne.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hirschberg, Mike, ''Vertiflite'', "[http://www.vtol.org/hph-news Human Powered Helicopters Rise Higher]", November–December, 2012. Retrieved July 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The AHS competition was named in honor of [[Igor Sikorsky]], one of the founders of the technical society. AHS initiated the prize purse at $25,000,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vtol.org/hph&lt;/ref&gt; but later raised it to $250,000.&lt;ref name="paur" /&gt;

The first HPH to get off the ground was the ''[[Da Vinci III]]'' in 1989, designed and built by students at [[Cal Poly San Luis Obispo]] in California, USA. It flew for 7.1 seconds and reached a height of {{convert|8|in|cm}}. The second was the ''Yuri I'' in 1994, designed and built by students at [[Nihon University]] in Japan. It flew for 19.46 seconds and reached an altitude of 20&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschberg, Mike, ''Vertiflite'', "Human Powered Helicopters Take-Off", July–August, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

With no human-powered helicopter getting off the ground since 1994, in 2009 [[Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation]] pledged to AHS International an increase in the size of the remuneration to $250,000, which significantly increased interest in the competition.&lt;ref name="paur" /&gt; It resulted in a new generation of human-powered helicopter teams, with two—one the University of Maryland and the other AeroVelo—in a "tight battle" to win.&lt;ref name="paur" /&gt;

Students at the [[University of Maryland]] designed and built the [[University of Maryland Gamera I Human Powered Helicopter|''Gamera I'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.umd.edu/html/media/release.php?id=104 |title=Press Release, A. James Clark School of Engineering, University of Maryland |publisher=Eng.umd.edu |date=May 11, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Gamera I'' successfully flew on May 12, 2011 for approximately four seconds, soon followed by a flight of 11 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/145251/20110513/gamera-maryland-sikorsky.htm |title=Gamera takes off but fails to bag Sikorsky Prize |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=May 13, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011 construction began on the improved [[University of Maryland Gamera II Human Powered Helicopter|''Gamera II'']]. On June 21, 2012, the ''Gamera II'' flew for a duration of 50 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agrc.umd.edu/news/news_story.php?id=6589 |title=Gamera Team Sets New Unofficial World Record for Human-Powered Helicopter Flight |publisher=Agrc.umd.edu |date=June 23, 2012 |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional tests of Gamera IIXR with a larger cruciform and longer rotors on August 28, 2012 yielded official world records of 65 seconds endurance on one flight and 8&amp;nbsp;ft altitude on another – the first "high altitude" flight of a human powered helicopter in history, and the first of the individual requirements to fall.&lt;ref&gt;AHS International, [[University of Maryland, College Park|Gamera team continues setting records]], August 28, 2012. Retrieved July 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24, 2012, the [[NTS Works]] [[NTS Works Upturn I|Upturn]] human-powered helicopter also successfully flew for 10 seconds, climbing to about {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vtol.org/news/upturn-human-powered-helicopter-flies|title=Upturn Human Powered Helicopter Flies! |publisher=Vtol.org |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NTS Works later donated the aircraft to the [[California Polytechnic State University]] which is developing it as the [[NTS Works Upturn II|Upturn II]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3627">'''Invested capital''' represents the total cash investment that [[shareholders]] and [[debtholders]] have made in a company. There are two different but completely equivalent methods for calculating invested capital.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newconstructs.com/education-invested-capital/&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''operating approach'' is calculated as:

Invested capital = operating net working capital + net property, plant &amp; equipment + capitalized operating leases + other operating assets + operating intangibles &amp;minus; other operating liabilities &amp;minus; cumulative adjustment for amortization of R&amp;D

Equivalently, the ''financing approach'' is calculated as
{|
|-
| Invested capital = || total debt and leases
|-
| align="right" | + ||  total equity and equity equivalents
|-
| align="right" | &amp;minus;  || non-operating cash and investments
|}

In symbols:

:&lt;math&gt;K = D + E - M \, &lt;/math&gt;

Invested capital is used in several important measurements of financial performance, including [[return on invested capital]], [[economic value added]], and [[free cash flow]].

'''Jack Cleveland Casino''' (formerly '''Horseshoe Cleveland''') is a [[casino]] in [[Downtown Cleveland|downtown]] [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], owned and operated by [[Jack Entertainment]].

==Casino==
Jack Cleveland Casino is located in the former [[Higbee's|Higbee Building]] at [[Tower City Center]] in downtown Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2015/07/tower_city_the_avenue_-_mall_m.html|work=[[The Plain Dealer|Cleveland.com]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|title=Tower City falters after big name beginning (vintage photos)|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=May 11, 2016|first=Brenda|last=Cain}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of gaming space.    The casino has 1,609 slot machines, 119 table games, and 35 electronic table games. The casino is accessible from Public Square, but is also accessible from the [[Terminal Tower]] and the Tower City Center shopping mall. The casino has teamed with the Renaissance, the Ritz-Carlton, and the [[Marriott at Key Center]] to offer rooms to its guests, and Rock Ohio Caesars purchased the Ritz-Carlton from [[Forest City Enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michelle|last=Jarboe McFee |title=Rock Ohio Caesars to buy Ritz-Carlton in downtown Cleveland, acquires 250 Huron offices |url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2011/12/rock_ohio_caesars_to_buy_cleve.html|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|location=[[Cleveland]]|date=December 9, 2011|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casino is open 24 hours a day and is completely smoke-free, compliant with Ohio law.  Since the casino has limited dining options, it has partnered with nearly a dozen downtown Cleveland restaurants.

==History==
Ohio voters approved (53%) a state constitutional amendment in November 2009 authorizing casinos in the state’s four largest cities: Cleveland, Cincinnati, Columbus and Toledo.&lt;ref&gt;Sheeran, Thomas. "Horseshoe Casino, Cleveland Casino, Opens To The Public". AP.org. Associated Press, 14 May. 2012. Web. 12 Dec 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the fifth statewide vote to legalize gambling in Ohio over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Ott, Thomas. "All Bets Are on." The Plain Dealer [Cleveland] 15 May 2012: A1+. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horseshoe Cleveland opened on May 14, 2012 as the first casino in the state of Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas|last=Ott|title=Ohio begins casino gambling era in Cleveland |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2012/05/ohio_begins_casino_gambling_er.html|work=[[The Plain Dealer|Cleveland.com]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|location=[[Cleveland]]|date=May 14, 2012|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was developed by Rock Ohio Caesars, a joint venture between [[Caesars Entertainment Corporation|Caesars Entertainment]] and [[Dan Gilbert (businessman)|Dan Gilbert]]'s [[Rock Ventures#Gaming|Rock Gaming]], and managed by Caesars.

[[Hollywood Casino Toledo]], developed and operated by [[Penn National Gaming]], opened on May 29, followed by Hollywood Columbus, which opened on October 8, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;"More competition for Detroit: Second Ohio casino opens in Toledo." Ap.org. Associated Press, 29 May. 2012. Web. 12 Dec 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Rock Ohio Caesars also developed [[Horseshoe Casino Cincinnati]], which opened on March 4, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Coolidge, Alexander. "Cincy casino to open March 4." Cincinnati.com. Cincinnati Enquirer, 12 Dec. 2012. Web. 12 Dec 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gross casino revenues are taxed at 33 percent, one of the highest rates in the nation for a resort casino with this level of investment. Portions of the tax revenue are designated for public school districts; the four host cities; all 88 state counties; the Ohio State Racing Commission; law enforcement training; and research and treatment of problem gambling and substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Amanda. "Cincinnati casino on pace to open in spring". AP.org. Associated Press, 6 Sep. 2012. Web. 12 Dec 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The bipartisan Ohio Casino Control Commission was created in 2011 to develop rules for casino gaming in Ohio, to license operators and to regulate and ensure the integrity of operations. It is also funded by casino tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Jeff. "Casino commission's hiring spree to begin."  Bizjournals.com. Cincinnati Business Courier, 12 Dec. 2012. Web. 12 Dec 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Ludington''' (April 18, 1827 &amp;ndash; April 1, 1891) was an American [[entrepreneur]], businessman, lumber baron, and [[Real estate development|real estate developer]].&lt;ref name ="MCHS303"&gt;{{harvnb|Mason County|1980|p=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="MCHS11"&gt;{{harvnb|Mason County|1980|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a businessman he would loan money to other businessmen. In one such loan he had to foreclose for delinquent payments on a sawmill operation in Michigan. He ultimately obtained the sawmill in the village of Pere Marquette. Ludington platted the land there and formed a town with a lumber company operation. He later sold his interest to the lumber company for a large sum of money and became very wealthy. The town later changed its name and became [[Ludington, Michigan]], although he never lived there.

== Biography==

James was born in [[Carmel, New York|Carmel]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on April 18, 1827.&lt;ref name ="Johnson227"&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1907|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843, the [[Ludington family]] moved from New York to [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], when James was 16. James and his father, [[Lewis Ludington]], founded [[Columbus, Wisconsin]] in 1845.&lt;ref name ="MCHS303"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Johnson227"/&gt; In 1849, [[Utah Territory|Utah Territorial]] Governor, [[Brigham Young]], wrote to Ludington, soliciting his help in the construction of a paper mill in the [[Salt Lake Valley]]. Ludington planned to travel west to supervise the mill's construction, but the deal was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;Ludington to Young, 1850 Jan 7, Feb 22, Mar 20. Brigham Young Papers. Church History Library. Salt Lake City, Utah.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 1854, Ludington loaned funds to [[George W. Ford]] for a sawmill operation in what was then known as the village of Pere Marquette in the northwestern part of the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan]]. When Ford defaulted on the loan and became insolvent in 1859, Ludington took over the operations of this sawmill.&lt;ref name ="MCHS303"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="MCHS11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cabot14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cabot|2005|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, Ludington filed for the purchase of unsold school land from the state of Wisconsin that was believed to contain some {{Convert|70000|acres|abbr=off}}. The sale was challenged and ultimately cancelled when the parcel was identified as containing over {{Convert|200000|acres|abbr=off}}. The purchase was re-filed after a further effort to specify which parcels were included. In 1855, the arrangements behind Ludington's purchase were investigated by James Halpin and Dr. Hunt, as to the amount of funds and whether they were properly appropriated. In 1856, Ludington was implicated in a bribery and fraud scheme surrounding the sale. He was cleared of wrongdoing after a lengthy legislative investigation and public testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joint Committee|1856|pp=26–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tuttle|1875|pp=293–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludington platted 360 acres of the land around Pere Marquette in 1867 and sold lots to individuals, developing the town.{{sfn|MasonCounty 1882|1882|p=19}} In the same year, he built a large commercial building, called "The Big Store" that sold a variety of goods. Also at that time Ludington founded the first newspaper in the village, the ''Mason County Record''.&lt;ref name ="MCHS303"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="MCHS11"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "cabot14"/&gt; The sawmill that Ludington acquired developed into an independent entity, called the Pere Marquette Lumber Company, which operated and managed the sawmill and The Big Store. On July 24, 1869, Ludington sold his interests to the company for half a million dollars, making him a  very wealthy person. Ludington used a portion of this money to develop the village. On March 22, 1873, the city of Ludington was chartered.&lt;ref name ="MCHS303"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="MCHS11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michigan150" /&gt;

Ludington lived in New York state as a boy and in Wisconsin as an adult,&lt;ref name ="MCHS303"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Johnson227"/&gt; but never lived in [[Ludington, Michigan]], the town that bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mason County|1980|p=303|ps=: ''He never married and he never lived in the city which bears his name.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The streets of Ludington Avenue and James Street are named after him. The streets Lewis, William, Robert, Charles, Harrison, Emily, Lavina, and Delia are named after his family members.&lt;ref name ="MCHS11"/&gt; Ludington died on April 1, 1891, in his residence at [[John Plankinton#Plankinton House Hotel|Plankinton House Hotel]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="Michigan150" /&gt; He is buried at Carmel where he was born.&lt;ref name=obit1&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=James Ludington passes away |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16740202/ |work= Chicago Tribune, page 5  |location= Chicago, Illinois |date= April 2, 1891 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obit2&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= James Ludington is dead|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ew8aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZSAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6635%2C12370 |work=Milwaukee Journal |location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin  |date= April 1, 1891|access-date=January 21, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6555">'''Kick the cat''' (or '''kick the dog'''&lt;ref name=pt&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200509/learning-not-lash-out|title=Learning Not to Lash Out|work=Psychology Today|first=Kat|last=McGowan|date=1 September 2005|accessdate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[metaphor]] used to describe how a relatively high-ranking person in an organization or family [[Displacement (psychology)|displaces]] his or her frustrations by abusing a lower-ranking person, who may in turn take it out on his or her own subordinate.

==Origin of the idiom==
The term has been used at least since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHwXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA35&amp;dq=%22kick+the+cat%22+business&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NrV1VNC5BbOUsQS7yYKQCg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kick%20the%20cat%22%20business&amp;f=false|title=Journal of Proceedings of the ... Annual Convention of Young Men's Christian Associations of the United States and British Provinces, Volume 14|p=35|year=1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author John Bradshaw, humans were far more cruel to cats at that time, to the extent that kicking one was not perceived to be unusual and hence entered the language as a popular idiom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cat Sense: How the New Feline Science Can Make You a Better Friend to Your Pet|first=John|last=Bradshaw|p=194|publisher=Basic Books|year=2013|isbn=978-0-465-04095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept was reinforced in British culture by a scene in the ''[[Blackadder]]'' episode ''[[Nob and Nobility]]'' in which Edmund Blackadder kicks the cat when annoyed, and the cat bites the mouse, and the mouse bites Baldrick.

In current usage, the name envisions a scenario where an angry or frustrated employee comes home from work looking for some way to take out his anger, but the only thing present is the cat. He physically abuses it as a means of relieving his frustration, despite the cat playing no part in causing it.&lt;ref name="glass"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWy2GlYGDx0C&amp;pg=PT80&amp;lpg=PT80&amp;dq=kick+the+cat+syndrome&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2EgZkGoIvF&amp;sig=U8Gf-TrF4cZLZII107iJg0nv8-o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cLJ1VMNKhsaxBIaggtgP&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=kick%20the%20cat%20syndrome&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Verbal Self Defense|first=Lillian|last=Glass|p=80|publisher=Penguin|year=1999|isbn=978-1-440-65074-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace or family dynamics==
Kicking the cat is commonly used to describe the behaviour of staff abusing coworkers or subordinates as a mechanism to relieve [[Occupational stress|stress]].&lt;ref name="quinn"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/jul/23/careers.theguardian5|title=With colleagues like these|first=Catherine|last=Quinn|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 July 2007|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour can result in a [[chain reaction]], where a higher-ranking member of the company abuses his or her subordinate, who takes it out on his or her own subordinate, and so on down the line. This [[domino effect]] can also be seen in family dynamics, where the father yells at the mother who yells at the older child who yells at the younger child who yells at the pet.&lt;ref&gt;Cooney, Beth, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1999-05-02/features/9904290688_1_chain-reaction-nuclear-families-emotions Grumpy Ol' Dad], Sun-Sentinel, May 2, 1999. Retrieved 5 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blaming]] others can lead to kicking the dog where individuals in a [[hierarchy]] blame their immediate subordinate, and this propagates down a hierarchy until the lowest rung (the "dog"). A 2009 experimental study has shown that blaming can be contagious even for uninvolved onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanna Bryner: [http://livescience.com/culture/blame-contagious-100119.html Workplace Blame Is Contagious and Detrimental], [[LiveScience]], 2010-01-19, citing the January 2010 issue of the ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]''.'.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological theories==
According to ''Psychology Today'', "Anger and frustration in one part of life can lead us to lash out at innocent people (or pets) in another."&lt;ref name=pt/&gt; The technical term for this kind of behaviour is "displaced aggression".&lt;ref name=pt/&gt;

Kicking the cat is looked upon unfavourably and viewed as a sign of  poor [[anger management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nLm2C_J9A90C&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=%22kick+the+cat%22+business&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NrV1VNC5BbOUsQS7yYKQCg&amp;ved=0CFsQuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kick%20the%20cat%22%20business&amp;f=false|title=Understanding and Training Your Cat or Kitten|first=H. Ellen|last=Whiteley|p=147|publisher=Sunstone Press|isbn=978-1-611-39080-3|quote="Learn to handle anger or quit the job"}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Steve Sonderman, "Men funnel 90 percent of their emotions through anger" and may "kick the cat" as a substitute for grief, [[anxiety]] or other emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iv47hJxGc0EC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=%22kick+the+cat%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=frB1VMKMFqyZsQSv3oLIDw&amp;ved=0CEQQuwUwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kick%20the%20cat%22&amp;f=false|title=Mobilizing Men for One-on-One Ministry: The Transforming Power of Authentic Friendship and Discipleship|first=Steve|last=Sonderman|p=168|publisher=Bethany House|year=2010|isbn=978-1-441-21376-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious |reason=A 'Christian author' is not a 'psychology expert', and the claim is outlandish and unsupported.|date=September 2016}} Psychology author [[Raj Persaud]] suggests that people "kick the cat" as a means of [[catharsis]] because they fear expressing their full emotions to the peers and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E86iK3a2mEUC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;dq=kick+the+cat+syndrome&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kKld8O5Z7D&amp;sig=_LsxyfIhnjvAioJpC_wni0JtqIY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hFR3VPS1OtO1sASp9YLwDQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=kick%20the%20cat%20syndrome&amp;f=false|title=Staying Sane|first=Raj|last=Persaud|authorlink=Raj Persaud|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-144-811106-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louis Jean Baptiste Bergeron''' (10 March 1876 – 23 February 1948) was a French entrepreneur, engineer and inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Edmond de Andréas "Bergeron Louis - Aix 1892", [https://mag.arts-et-metiers.fr/ Arts et Métiers Magazine], September 2002, retrieved from [https://patrimoine.gadz.org/gadz/bergeron.htm  "Illustrious GADZ'ARTS / Bergeron (in French)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergeron was born in [[Lagnieu]]. In 1900, he started work as an electrical engineer and made a career in the Farcot company in St Ouen, a factory of steam engines and high-power electrical machines. In 1918, together with Beaudrey, he co-founded the company Beaudrey-Bergeron, which later, after a friendly split with Beaudrey, became Bergeron S.A., now part of [[Alstom]].

He is remembered for his practical, mathematical methodology to study [[water hammer]] in hydraulic pipe systems which he also showed to be useful in the study of electromagnetic voltage/current surges in electricity systems. His last work ''From water hammer in hydraulics to lightning surges in electricity'',&lt;ref&gt;Bergeron, Louis Jean Baptiste "Du Coup de Bélier en Hydraulique - Au Coup de Foudre en Electricité (Waterhammer in hydraulics and wave surges in electricity)", 1950, Paris: Dunod (in French) (English translation by ASME Committee, New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1961.)&lt;/ref&gt; published posthumously, became a reference work in [[electrical engineering]].

In electrical engineering, application of so-called "Bergeron equations" allows the calculation of [[travelling wave]] phenomena in "long" conductors using numerical analysis. [[Hermann W. Dommel]] used these "Bergeron equations" in the [[Emtp|EMTP]] (electromagnetic transient program) software in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.openelectrical.org/index.php?title=Bergeron_Line_Model|title=Bergeron Line Model - Open Electrical|website=wiki.openelectrical.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucien Barrière''' (14 January 1923 – 17 September 1990) was a French entrepreneur and [[businessman]]. He was the heir and founder of the [[Lucien Barrière group]], one of the largest group of casinos, luxury hotels, resorts and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.challenges.fr/entreprise/20130606.CHA0316/bluffant-dominique-desseigne-pdg-de-groupe-lucien-barriere.html|title=Bluffant - Dominique Desseigne, PDG de Groupe Lucien Barrière|work=Challenges|date=June 7, 2013|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

He was born in the French Ardèche region from a modest, goat raising family.

In 1962, he was chosen by his uncle François André, who had no direct descendants, to succeed him as head of several successful companies specializing in the operation of [[casino]]s and luxury hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcbourse.com/apprendre/biographie_lucien_barriere-98|title=Lucien Barriere|work=ABC Bourse|date=|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casinos of [[Deauville]], [[Cannes]] and [[La Baule]] and the hotels Normandy Barriere, Royal Barriere and the Hotel du Golf Barriere de Deauville were among the best known assets of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.normandie-tourisme.fr/Hotel-du-Golf-Barriere/HOT/SAINT-ARNOULT/fiche-HOTNOR014FS001S9-2.html|title=Hotel du Golf Barrière|work=Normandy Tourism|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, he became the general manager of the group. For thirty years he developed the successful Barriere empire following the same policy as his predecessor: luxury, sophistication, perfection, elegance, refinement, friendliness and cultivating the French [[joie de vivre]].

He married Martha Szentgyörgyi (died October 11, 2008), a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] dancer. Martha had a daughter from a previous marriage, Diane, born in 1957, which he adopted and raised as his own. He taught her the know-how of the trade, before designating her as the sole heir of his luxury empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Economie/Dominique-Desseigne-se-devoile-pour-Paris-Match-et-parle-de-ses-relations-avec-Rachida-Dati-136419|title=Dominique Desseigne se dévoile pour PAris Match et parle de ses relations avec Rachida Dati|work=Paris Match|date=October 2, 2012|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, he founded the [[Lucien Barrière group]], one of the first French companies charged with managing casinos and luxury hotels.

In 1975, Lucien Barrière sponsored the creation of the [[American Film Festival]] in Deauville, alongside the major proponents of this idea, the Mayor of Deauville [[Michel d'Ornano]], André Halimi and Lionel Shushan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confidentielles.com/r_13496_le-parcours-de-lucien-barriere.htm|title=Le parcours de Lucien Barrière|work=Confidentielles|date=|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, he died at Caen University Hospital of cardiac arrest at the age of 67, following complications resulting from a [[coronary angioplasty]] carried out by Professor Grollier. Diane, married to the notary Dominique Desseigne, succeeded her adoptive father as head of the group and pursued the same successful policy as her predecessors. In July 1995 she was the victim of a serious plane crash that left her [[quadriplegic]], and later died in May 2001 at 44 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellocoton.fr/to/PaP#http://www.purepeople.com/article/mort-de-martha-barriere-du-groupe-barriere_a17126/1|title=Mort de MArtha Barrière, du groupe Barrière...|work=Pure People|date=|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labandearuquier.com/Hommage-a-Martha-Barriere-l-amie.html|title=Hommage à Martha Barrière, l'ami de Steevy|work=La bande à Ruquier|date=|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maurice''' ("Maus") '''Gatsonides''' (February 14, 1911 in [[Gombong]], [[Kebumen Regency]] &amp;ndash; November 29, 1998 in  [[Heemstede]]) was a Dutch [[rally driver]] and inventor. Gatsonides was born in [[Central Java]] in the former [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]). He founded the company "Gatsometer BV" in the Netherlands in 1958.

Today, Gatsonides' fame largely results from inventing the [[Gatso]] speed camera, a speed measuring device used today by many police forces to catch [[speeding]] drivers. He originally invented the Gatso speed camera to measure his cornering speed in an attempt to improve his driving.

==Motor racing==
Gatsonides is primarily known for inventing the [[speed camera]], but his primary interest was in motor racing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.supercars.net/cars/302.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:1948 Gatso 1500 Sport (37977905262).jpg|thumb|Gatso 1500 Sport, aka "Platje", 1948]]Maurice was passionate about racing and raced in many events. However, in 1949, he built his own car. It was nicknamed the "Platje" (English: "Flatty")  because of its aerodynamic shape. The car caused a sensation at the Dutch [[Circuit Park Zandvoort|Zandvoort Racetrack]], passing all of the opponents including [[MG Cars|MG]]'s. Maurice was forced to sell the Flatty to pay creditors after trying to put his own V8 sportscar into production. The Flatty however, survived. It was found abandoned in the 1970s and has now been restored by Joop Bruggeman. It is the last surviving Gatso car. Gatsonides won the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] in 1953 driving a [[Ford Zephyr]].

'''Media Intelligence''' uses data mining and [[data science]] to analyze public [[social content|social]] and editorial [[media content]]. It refers to marketing systems that synthesize billions of [[online conversation]]s into relevant information that allow organizations to measure and manage content performance, understand trends, and drive communications and [[business strategy]].

Media intelligence can include [[software as a service]] using [[big data]] terminology.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite web |title= Digital Breadcrumbs and the New Media Intelligence |author= Leslie Nuccio |date= January 19, 2015  |url=http://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/digital-breadcrumbs-and-new-media-intelligence |publisher=Social Media Today |access-date= March 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes questions about messaging efficiency, [[share of voice]], audience geographical distribution, message amplification, [[influencer]] strategy, journalist outreach, creative resonance, and competitor performance in all these areas.

Media intelligence differs from [[business intelligence]] in that it uses and analyzes data outside company [[firewall (computing)|firewall]]s.  Examples of that data are [[user-generated content]] on social media sites, [[blog]]s, comment fields, and wikis etc.  It may also include other public data sources like [[press release]]s, news, blogs, legal filings, reviews and job postings.

Media Intelligence may also include competitive intelligence, wherein information that is gathered from publicly available sources such as social media, press releases, and news announcements are used to better understand the strategies and tactics being deployed by competing businesses. 

Media Intelligence is enhanced by means of emerging technologies like [[semantic tagging]], [[Natural language processing|Natural Language Processing]], [[sentiment analysis]] and [[machine translation]]. 

==Technologies used==
Different media intelligence platforms use different technologies for [[Internet surveillance|monitoring]], curating content, engaging with content, data analysis and measurement of communications and marketing campaign success. These technology providers, such as [https://www.buzzcovery.com BuzzCovery] [[Meltwater (company)|Meltwater]], [http://www.synoptos.com Synoptos], [[Salesforce.com|Radian 6]], or Sysomos may obtain content by scraping content directly from websites or by connecting to the API provided by social media or other content platforms that are created for 3rd party developers to develop their own applications and services that access data. [[Facebook Graph Search|Facebook's Graph API]] is one such API that social media monitoring solution products would connect to pull data from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api |title=Graph API |date= |accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology companies may also get '''data from a data reseller,''' such as DataSift (acquired by Meltwater), Gnip (acquired by [[Twitter]]), LexisNexis, or Dow Jones/Factiva.

Some social media monitoring and analytics companies use calls to data providers each time an end-user develops a query. Others archive and index social media posts to provide end users with on-demand access to historical data and enable methodologies and technologies leveraging network and relational data.  Additional monitoring companies use crawlers and spidering technology to find keyword references, known as [[semantic analysis (linguistics)|semantic analysis]] or [[natural language processing]]. Basic implementation involves curating data from social media on a large scale and analyzing the results to make sense out of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De |first1=Shaunak |last2=Maity |first2=Abhishek |last3=Goel |first3=Vritti |last4=Shitole |first4=Sanjay |last5=Bhattacharya |first5=Avik |title=Predicting the popularity of instagram posts for a lifestyle magazine using deep learning |journal=2nd IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems, Computing and IT Applications (CSCITA) |date=2017 |page=174-177 |doi=10.1109/CSCITA.2017.8066548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michigan Avenue''' is a north-south street in [[Chicago]] which runs at 100 east on the [[Roads and freeways in Chicago#Grid|Chicago grid]]. The northern end of the street is at [[Lake Shore Drive]] on the shore of [[Lake Michigan]] in the [[Gold Coast Historic District (Chicago)|Gold Coast Historic District]].  The street's southern terminus is at [[Illinois Route 83|Sibley Boulevard]] in the southern suburb of [[Harvey, Illinois|Harvey]], though like many Chicago streets it exists in several disjointed segments.&lt;ref name=SCMA&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayner|first=Don|first2=Tom|last2=McNamee|title=Streetwise Chicago, Michigan Avenue/Michigan Avenue (Pvt.)|page=87|publisher=Loyola University Press|year=1988|isbn=0-8294-0597-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the home of the [[Chicago Water Tower]], the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], [[Millennium Park]], and the  shopping on the [[Magnificent Mile]], it is a street well known to Chicago natives as well as [[Tourism in Chicago|tourists]] to the city.  Michigan Avenue also is the main commercial street of [[Streeterville]]. It includes all of the [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]] and most of the [[Michigan–Wacker Historic District]], including the scenic urban space anchored by the [[Michigan Avenue Bridge]].

==History==
[[File:Collier's 1921 Vol 2 Frontispiece -- Chicago.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1921 [[Collier's Magazine]] Michigan Avenue from Grant Park]]

The oldest section of Michigan Avenue is the portion that currently borders [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] in the [[Chicago Loop]] section of the city. The name came from [[Lake Michigan]], which until 1871 was immediately east of Michigan Avenue. The street at that time ran north to the [[Chicago River]] and south to the city limits. Originally, Michigan Avenue was primarily residential, and by the 1860s, large homes and expensive row houses dominated Michigan Avenue.

At no point is Michigan Avenue currently called Michigan Boulevard, but prior to the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, the street was officially known as Michigan Boulevard and often referred to as "Boul Mich".&lt;ref name=CLBMT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/Tours/BoulMich.html|title=Boul Mich Tour|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|year=2003|accessdate=2007-05-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033614/http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/Tours/BoulMich.html|archivedate=2007-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in the 1900-1907 Ads for the Chicago Musical College, the address was referred to as "202 Michigan Boul." As recently as the 1920s, North Michigan Avenue (especially the [[Magnificent Mile]]) was referred to as "Upper Boul Mich".&lt;ref name="CNMAic"&gt;Stamper, John M., "Chicago's North Michigan Avenue," University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. ix, {{ISBN|0-226-77085-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Paris]]'s [[Boulevard Saint-Michel]] is the original Boul Mich.

North of the Chicago River today's Michigan Avenue was known as Pine Street. In 1866 a small portion of Pine Street was "vacated" and moved eighty (80) feet further west of the original Pine street location to accommodate the installation of the new pumping station's standpipe. This standpipe, engineered to regulate water pressure, would be housed within architect William W. Boyington's castle structure (Water Tower) that still stands on that site today. In 1869 the Board of Public Works began paving Pine Street from Chicago Avenue to Whitney street (today, Walton street) the northern terminus, with Belgian wood blocks also known as Nicolson pavement.

Pine Street was renamed to Lincoln Park Boulevard as far south as Ohio Street when the street connected with Lake Shore Drive in the early 1890s, and then became part of Michigan Avenue, which already had the name Michigan Avenue (Michigan Boulevard before the Great Chicago Fire in 1871) south of the Chicago River. Both the North and South Michigan Avenues were joined physically with the opening of the Michigan Avenue bridge in 1920. In 1926, after years of clogged automobile traffic, the water tower and pumping station were separated by realigning Michigan Avenue to run between them.[[File:Art Institute, Chicago circa 1907 postcard (front).tiff|thumb|right|250px|A [[postcard]] of the Art Institute posted 1907]]

In the [[Great Chicago Fire|Great Fire of 1871]], all buildings on Michigan Avenue from Congress Street north to the river were destroyed. Immediately after the fire, the character of Michigan remained residential, but the street no longer was directly on the lake shore, as after the Fire, wreckage from the burnt district was used to fill in the inner harbor of Chicago, beginning the landfills that by the 1920s had moved the lake shore more than a quarter-mile east of its original shoreline, creating space for an expanded Grant Park. Beginning in the 1880s, the expansion of the central business district replaced houses on Michigan Avenue so that today, Michigan's character is primarily commercial north of 35th Street.

The first city showcase on Michigan Avenue was the Exposition Building, which was built on the current site of the Art Institute, the east side of Michigan at Adams, in 1874.  By the 1890s, an imposing wall of buildings was constructed on the west side of Michigan Avenue downtown, including the [[Auditorium Building, Chicago|Auditorium Building]] and the main branch of the [[Chicago Public Library]] (now the [[Chicago Cultural Center]]).  As the east side of Michigan Avenue downtown was developed as a park, the wall of buildings lining the west side of Michigan Avenue across from the park became the nucleus of the city's skyline.

In 1924, the first [[traffic light]]s in Chicago were installed on Michigan Avenue after [[John D. Hertz]] fronted the city $34,000 for the purchase, installation, and maintenance.&lt;ref name="magazine"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Golden opportunity | newspaper = Chicago Tribune Magazine | pages = 31 | date = 2007-11-25 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, [[Illinois Route 1]] and [[U.S. Route 41]] were routed on Michigan Avenue. Illinois Route 1 has been truncated to Chicago's south side and U.S. Route 41 is now routed on Lake Shore Drive.

Michigan Avenue originally ended at the Chicago River, and what is now Michigan Avenue north of the river was originally named Pine Street, after scattered pine trees originally found in its vicinity. As early as 1891 plans were proposed to extend Michigan Avenue north across the river.&lt;ref name="Tribune19200514"&gt;{{cite news|title="I Will" Spirit Wins; Open Link Bridge Today|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=May 14, 1920|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Great Boulevard Subway Project for Connecting North and South Divisions of the City|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 22, 1903|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1903 an editorial in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' [[newspaper]] proposed a new [[Bascule bridge]] across the river at Michigan Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Michigan Avenue Dream|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=May 31, 1903|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Experts Praise Boulevard Plan|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 21, 1903|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This plan was further elaborated upon in [[Daniel Burnham]]'s [[1909 Plan of Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burnham|first=Daniel H.|authorlink=Daniel Burnham|last2=Bennett|first2=Edward H.|authorlink2=Edward H.

At its north end it merges into [[Lake Shore Drive]] near the [[Drake Hotel (Chicago)|Drake Hotel]].

Today, the area north of the [[Chicago River]] is referred to as the "[[Magnificent Mile]]", or sometimes simply the Mag Mile. It contains a mixture of upscale [[department store]]s, restaurants, high-end retailers, office buildings and [[hotel]]s, and caters primarily to [[tourist]]s and the affluent. The area also has a high concentration of the city's [[advertising agency|advertising agencies]] and major [[Mass media|media]] firms, including the ''Chicago Tribune''.

It is the home of Chicago's famous [[Chicago Water Tower|Water Tower]] landmark, [[Water Tower Park]] with its historic clock, as well as the eight-level [[Water Tower Place]] shopping center which grew up next door to, and overshadowed, the comparatively diminutive landmark.  North of the shopping center can be found the famous [[John Hancock Center]], the [[art deco]] [[Palmolive Building]] (also known as the ''[[Playboy]]'' Building) and the lavish [[Drake Hotel (Chicago)|Drake Hotel]]. The entire mile is noted for its spectacular [[Christmas]] displays. At the northern edge of this district can be found the [[One Magnificent Mile]] building; [[Chicago Landmark]] [[East Lake Shore Drive District]], an extremely expensive and exclusive one-block area of [[real estate]] running east from North Michigan Avenue and facing directly onto [[Lake Michigan]]; and the on-ramp to northbound [[Lake Shore Drive]].

For a few blocks on both sides of the [[Chicago River]], the road is double-decked, including the bridge over the river. The lower level north of the river is where the famous [[Billy Goat Tavern]] is located, and south of the river it intersects with Lower Wacker Drive.  On the upper lever, tall office buildings and hotels line both sides of the Avenue, until [[Millennium Park]].

The portion of Michigan Avenue opposite [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] is the [[Chicago Landmark]] [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]]. Major cultural institutions, such as the [[Chicago Cultural Center]], [[Symphony Center]], and the [[Auditorium Theater]] are located here, as are many late 19th and early 20th century skyscrapers. In 2009, the Chicago Cultural Mile Association was created to bring "awareness of the unique strengths and diverse offerings available to visitors"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagoculturalmile.org/about/our-history/|title=Our History - Chicago Cultural Mile|work=Chicago Cultural Mile|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this portion of Michigan Avenue.

The [[Art Institute of Chicago]] is across the boulevard, in Grant Park along the Avenue.  Several large historic hotels are located just south of [[Congress Parkway]], including the Hilton Towers Chicago (formerly, the Stevens Hotel), the [[Congress Plaza Hotel]] and the [[Blackstone Hotel]]. Between them is the [[Spertus Institute]] of Jewish Studies.

The Avenue extends south into [[Near South Side, Chicago]] and beyond – past what was once the notorious [[Levee District]], the graceful homes of the [[Prairie Avenue District]], the historic [[Second Presbyterian Church (Chicago, Illinois)|Second Presbyterian Church]], the former home of the legendary [[Chess Records]] at 2120 South Michigan and the site where the [[Lexington Hotel]], a hideout of [[Al Capone]], once stood.

South of [[Cermak Road]] is the [[Motor Row District]], a historic strip along Michigan Avenue that was home to many early 20th century automobile "palaces." A point of interest in this area is the former Illinois Automobile Club, which later was used as the home of the [[Chicago Defender]], a prominent African-American Chicago newspaper at 2400 South Michigan. A little bit further south is [[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]], a historic black community in Chicago. Points of interest include the historic [[Mercy Hospital and Medical Center]], the [[Illinois College of Optometry]] and the [[South Side Community Art Center]].

The intersection of Michigan Avenue and 35th Street is home to two important local institutions. On the northwest corner is [[De La Salle Institute]], a Catholic high school which was attended by future [[Chicago mayors]] [[Richard J. Daley]], [[Richard M. Daley]], and [[Michael Bilandic]]. On the southwest corner is the [[Chicago Police Department]] Headquarters. Michigan Avenue continues through the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] and dead ends at 63rd Street, just north of a rail yard and parking lots.

The Avenue continues heading south at 66th Street to Marquette Road, where it moves a half-block to the east back into alignment with the run north of 63rd Street. It then continues south to 89th Street where it dead ends once again for a housing subdivision and a railroad line. It resumes at 91st Street heading south through the working class [[Roseland, Chicago|Roseland]] community, featuring a large commercial strip along Michigan between 111th and 115th streets. The street dead ends again at 127th Street just before the [[Cal-Sag Channel]]. It begins again in the south [[suburb]] of [[Riverdale, Illinois|Riverdale]] before finally terminating at Sibley Boulevard or IL RT-83.

==Transportation==
The [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|CTA Red Line]]'s Chicago and Grand stations are useful for reaching the Magnificent Mile.  The Jackson station is close to the Art Institute, as are Loop stations on the Brown, Pink and Blue lines. [[Millennium Station|Millennium]] and [[Van Buren Street (Metra station)|Van Buren Street]] Stations are located along Michigan Avenue serving the [[Metra Electric Line|Metra Electric]] and [[South Shore Line|South Shore]] Lines. The avenue is also traversed by a multitude of bus routes and taxi cabs primarily in the Downtown and [[Magnificent Mile]] areas.

The language used in the title can be misleading, as pointed by historian Abel Sierra Madero, "The hybrid structure of work camps cum military units served to camouflage the true objectives of the recruitment effort and to distance the UMAPs from the legacy of forced labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sierra Madero|first1=Abel|title=Academies To Produce Macho-Men In Cuba|url=https://translatingcuba.com/academies-to-produce-macho-men-in-cuba-abel-sierra-madero/|website=Translating Cuba|publisher=Translating Cuba|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;The majority of UMAP servicemen were conscientious objectors. A small portion or about 8% to 9% of the inmates were [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] men, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Catholic priests]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant ministers]], intellectuals, farmers who resisted [[collectivization]], as well as anyone else considered "anti-social" or "counter-revolutionary".&lt;ref name="Guerra"/&gt; Former [[Intelligence Directorate]] agent [[Norberto Fuentes]] estimated that of approximately 35,000 internees, 507 ended up in psychiatric wards, 72 died from torture, and 180 committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Fuentes, Norberto. Dulces Guerreros Cubanos. Barcelona: 1999. 300-303. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1967 human rights report from the [[Organization of American States]] found that over 30,000 internees are "forced to work for free in state farms from 10 to 12 hours a day, from sunrise to sunset, seven days per week, poor alimentation with rice and spoiled food, unhealthy water, unclean plates, congested barracks, no electricity, latrines, no showers, inmates are given the same treatment as political prisoners."&lt;ref name="cidh"&gt;http://www.cidh.org/countryrep/cuba67sp/cap.1a.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The report concludes that the UMAP camps’ two objectives are "facilitating free labor for the state" and "punishing young people who refuse to join communist organizations."&lt;ref name="cidh"/&gt; The Cuban government maintained that the UMAPs are not labor camps, but part of military service.&lt;ref name="cidh"/&gt; In a 2010 interview with ''La Jornada'', [[Fidel Castro]] admitted in response to a question about the UMAP camps that "Yes, there were moments of great injustice, great injustice!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/08/31/mundo/026e1mun|title=La Jornada: Soy el responsable de la persecución a homosexuales que hubo en Cuba: Fidel Castro|last=C.V|first=DEMOS, Desarrollo de Medios, S. A. de|website=La Jornada|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically the Cuban government has presented UMAPs as a mistake, but according to Abel Sierra Madero, this institution has to be understood as part of a project of “social engineering” tailored for political and social control. Sophisticated methodologies were deployed that incorporated judicial, military, educational, medical and psychiatric apparatuses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sierra Madero|first1=Abel|title="El trabajo os hará hombres”: Masculinización nacional, trabajo forzado y control social en Cuba durante los años sesenta.|journal=Cuban Studies|date=2016|volume=44|page=309-349|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/613550|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Origins==
It is rumored that the UMAP camps were initially proposed by [[Fidel Castro]] and implemented by [[Raúl Castro]] after a state visit to the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, where he learned that the Soviets ran camps for "anti-socials".&lt;ref name="Almendros"&gt;Almendros, Néstor, dir. Improper Conduct. 1984. Film.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an April 14, 1966 article in ''[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]]'', the official state newspaper, the UMAP camps were proposed at a November 1965 meeting between Fidel Castro and military leaders.&lt;ref name="Ros_155"&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were concerned over how to handle "misplaced elements".&lt;ref name="Ros_155"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Quedaba por ver el caso de una serie de elementos desubicados, vagos, que ni trabajaban, ni estudiaban. ¿Qué hacer con ellos? La cuestión era tema de preocupación para los dirigentes de la Revolución.''
''Un día del mes de noviembre del pasado año (1965) un grupo de oficiales se encontraban reunidos en el Estado Mayor General y discutían estas cuestiones. Hablaban con Fidel, el cual compartía esas mismas preocupaciones y le propusieron la creación de la UMAP."''&lt;ref name="Ros_155"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 

"Still left to consider was the case of misplaced elements, deadbeats, those who neither studied nor worked. What can be done with these people? This question was the worrying concern for the leaders of the Revolution.
One day in November of last year, 1965, a group of military officials met to discuss these questions. They spoke with Fidel, who shared these concerns and proposed to him the creation of the UMAP."''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- ==Operations==
The main ''recogidas'' ("round ups") of UMAP internees occurred in November 1965 and June 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another large ''recogida'' occurred after an airplane engineer for Cubana Airlines attempted to hijack an airplane in March 1966, which resulted in the firing of many airline employees and their sentencing to UMAP camps even without any connection to the hijacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=140–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most common ways that individuals were taken to UMAP camps was through a false notice to appear for military service, which became obligatory with the establishment of the draft on November 12, 1963 through ''Ley 1129''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=13, 52, 79, 94, 101, 141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals would receive a telegram with a notice to appear at a given location for SMO ("Servicio Militar Obligatorio," ''Obligatory Military Service''). Instead of being taken to an actual military camp to receive training for the army, they would be transported by train, truck, or bus to agricultural UMAP labor camps which were located in Camagüey, the former province on the eastern side of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions on the up to 8 hour trip across the island were poor, with internees provided little clean water, food, or facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=20, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Almendros"/&gt;

Many interviewees in the documentary [[Improper Conduct]] report that police directly rounded up people off the streets into buses to be taken to UMAP camps. This method of selection into UMAP camps appears to have been more common for effeminate gay men and "anti-socials" such as "hippies."&lt;ref name="Almendros"/&gt;

UMAP camps typically held 120 internees, split up into squads of ten.&lt;ref name="Ros_34"&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each UMAP camp typically consisted of three barracks, two for internees and one for military personnel.&lt;ref name="Ros_34"/&gt; Camps had no running water or electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internees at the UMAP camps received no military training and were given no arms.&lt;ref name="Ros_34"/&gt; Their uniform was blue pants, a denim shirt, and boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The labor the internees performed consisted of a variety of agricultural tasks, from tearing down the [[marabou (weed)|marabou]] plant to picking fruit, but they mostly engaged in the cutting of sugar cane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bejel_100"&gt;{{harvp|Bejel|2001|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the military personnel who ran the camps were illiterate or semi-illiterate soldiers.&lt;ref name="Ros_45_46"&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cuban government assigned these undereducated soldiers to UMAP camps because they were trying to professionalize the Cuban military.&lt;ref name="Ros_45_46"/&gt;

Every squad of ten was led by a ''cabo'' ("corporal") who was one of the inmates.&lt;ref name="Ros_161_163"&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=161, 163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''cabo'' was in charge of tasks such as showing their squad where to work, but still wore the same uniform as other internees and still had to perform agricultural labor.&lt;ref name="Ros_161_163"/&gt;

Each camp also had an accountant who was chosen from amongst the inmates.&lt;ref name="Ros_165"&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accountant was in charge of keeping track of the amount of work each internee completed.&lt;ref name="Ros_165"/&gt;

Lastly, each camp had a ''suministro'', also an internee, who was in charge of bringing food rations from a central military barrack back to their respective UMAP camp, where the ''suministro'' would distribute food amongst fellow internees.&lt;ref name="Ros_166_168"&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=166–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''suministro'' would have to carefully allocate the food amongst internees or else they would run out of food before the end of the month.&lt;ref name="Ros_166_168"/&gt; Former ''suministros'' from UMAP camps report that military officials did not provide enough food so that they could take the remaining foodstuffs back home or sell them to people in the countryside (''guajiros'').&lt;ref name="Ros_166_168"/&gt;

Internees were divided by category, into camps for gay men and camps for everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=55, 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internees were often divided by category (Jehovah’s Witnesses, gay men, Catholics, etc.) en route to the camps and also at the camps themselves, where homosexuals and effeminate men would often be selected from one camp to another especially for homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=55, 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are many reports of physical abuse at the camps, especially directed towards Jehovah’s Witnesses. Among the many forms of abuse, former internees report Jehovah’s Witnesses being beaten, threatened with execution, stuffed with dirt in their mouths, buried in the ground until their neck, and tied up naked outside in barbed wire without food or water until fainting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=80, 101, 112, 193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emilio Bejel, author of ''Gay Cuban Nation'', wrote that some of the officials who ran the camps were executed due to how badly they mistreated the inmates.&lt;ref name="Bejel_100"/&gt; Nevertheless, the state-run ''Granma'' newspaper reported: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When the first groups, which were nothing good, began to arrive, some officers didn't have either the necessary patience or the required experience and lost their temper. For these reasons, some officers were submitted to a court-martial. In some cases they were demoted and, in other ones [cases] they were expelled from the Armed Forces (''Granma'', April 14, 1966).&lt;ref&gt;Zayas, Manuel. Mapa de la homofobia. http://manuelzayas.wordpress.com/mapa-de-la-homofobia/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some internees mutilated themselves so they could be transferred from the camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|pp=205–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
===Third-party testimony of UMAP camps===
Paul Kidd, a Canadian foreign news correspondent, provides the only known first-hand, third party account of the UMAP camps. Kidd traveled to Cuba on August 29, 1966 to write for Southam News Service.&lt;ref name="Edmonton"&gt;Kidd, Paul. ""Cuba Expels Reporter"." Edmonton Journal 10 09 1966, Print.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 8, the Cuban foreign ministry asked him to leave "by the first flight" because he took photographs of anti-aircraft guns visible from his hotel room window and exhibited an incorrect attitude toward the revolution in an article he had published earlier.&lt;ref name="Edmonton"/&gt;

During this trip, Kidd departed Havana and wandered through the rural, former province of Camaguey where he encountered a UMAP labor camp near the hamlet of El Dos de Cespedes.&lt;ref name="Kidd"&gt;Kidd, Paul. "The Price of Achievement Under Castro". Saturday Review. 03 1969: 23-25. Web. &lt;http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1969may03-00023&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The barbed-wire enclosed camp was run by 10 security guards and held 120 internees, consisting of Jehovah's Witnesses, Roman Catholics, and "those loosely termed 'social misfits' by the government".&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt; The ages of the inmates ranged from 16 years old to over 60.&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt; None of the internees were given arms; all weapons at the camp were under the control of the ten guards running the camp.&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt;

The internees worked an average of 60 hours a week for a monthly income of 7 pesos (roughly worth a meal) and their internment typically lasted for at least six months.&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt; Cubans who served in the standard SMO ("Servicio Militar Obligatorio", ''Obligatory Military Service'') received the same monthly wage of 7 pesos a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ros|2004|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As long as their agricultural quotas were met, most internees at the camp were allowed a break to visit family after six months of internment.&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt; Family members were allowed to visit internees at the camp on the second Sunday of each month and could bring personal items such as cigarettes to internees.&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt;

Internees at the camp Kidd discovered were housed in two long, white concrete buildings with no windows just the hole in the wall which had bunk beds with sacks slung between wooden beams for mattresses. After agricultural work was complete, internees were instructed in communist ideology for two hours every night.&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt;

Kidd estimated that about 200 such camps existed and in total housed about 30,000 people.&lt;ref name="Kidd"/&gt;

The '''Mouvement des entreprises de France''' ('''MEDEF'''), or the '''Movement of the Enterprises of France''', is the largest [[employer federation]] in [[France]]. Established in 1998, it replaced the '''Conseil national du patronat Français''' ('''[[CNPF]]'''), or the "National Council of the French Employers", which was founded in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qu’est-ce qu’un syndicat et comment s’organise-t-il ?|url=http://www.vie-publique.fr/decouverte-institutions/citoyen/participation/syndicat/qu-est-ce-qu-syndicat-comment-s-organise-t-il.html|publisher=Vie Publique|accessdate=13 January 2013|language=French|date=30 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has more than 750,000 member firms, 90 percent of them being [[small and medium enterprise]]s (SMEs) with fewer than 50 employees. MEDEF is engaged in [[lobbying]] at local, regional, national, and [[European Union|EU]]-wide levels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medef.com/en/who-are-we/overview MEDEF Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, MEDEF International organises a number of delegations of French business leaders with tangible projects to targeted countries, especially [[developing countries]]. MEDEF espouses “[[sustainable development]]”, raising companies’ awareness to the fact that environmental protection can also feature among their competitive advantages.

Its current president, is Geoffrey Roux de Bezieux as of July 2018.

He represented the Commissar on the State Planning Commission. Von Meck outlined his ideas in the field of economics and prospects for domestic rail transport in a series of books published between 1921 and 1927.

He was arrested for the final time in 1928, and in May 1929 the [[OGPU]] (forerunner of the [[KGB]]) sentenced him to death for [[Wrecking (Soviet Union)|wrecking]]; that is, attempts to sabotage Soviet authority through substandard work.

'''Odournet''' is a [[Netherlands]]-based international consultancy company specializing in environmental and product odor management and assessment.&lt;ref name="BSOpp"/&gt; Odournet also manufactures products for odor assessment like [[Olfactometer|olfactometers]] and other odor testing and sampling equipment.&lt;ref name="UAB"/&gt; The company has labs and offices in nations like the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[India]], [[Brazil]], and others.&lt;ref name="BSOpp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UAB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MEN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OloresMerger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GOA"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =Odour management expertise now in india | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Goacom | date =19 February 2013 | url =http://www.goacom.com/business/6237-odour-management-expertise-now-in-india| accessdate =8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The precursor to Odournet, Project Research Amsterdam, was founded in 1980 by Anton Philip "Ton" van Harreveld.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; The [[sole proprietorship]] sought to more efficiently characterize and abate odors in environmental settings.&lt;ref name="Ando"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amiando.com/WGYGFMG.html?page=958097 |title=How R&amp;D improves Sustainability and Quality of Life in Smart Cities |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.amiando.com |publisher=[[Amiando]]|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first computerized olfactometer was developed by VanHarreveld's then unipersonal company Project Research Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; This company was incorporated as a limited, Project Research Amsterdam BV in 1989, adding environmental consultant Frans Vossen as co-founder. The company became known as Odournet in 1993, and they opened their first international office in [[Bradford on Avon]], [[England]] the following year.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizdb.co.uk/company/Odournet-uk-ltd-02900894/|title=Odournet Uk Ltd |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.bizdb.co.uk |publisher=BizDB|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Odournet merged with Ecoma and OLFAtec, two similar odor management consultancy companies based in Germany. Ecoma and OLFAtec were absorbed into Odournet under the terms of the merger.&lt;ref name="OloresMerger"/&gt; Founder Ton van Harreveld served as Odournet's [[CEO]] until 2014. He stepped down from the position, allowing Simon Rützel-Grünberg to take over. Van Harreveld remains a board member and the [[chief innovation officer]] at the company.&lt;ref name="CEO"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =Environmental group, Odournet, appoints Simon Rützel-Grünberg as new CEO | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Future Enviro | date =1 October 2014 | url =http://futurenviro.es/en/simon-rutzel-grunberg-nuevo-director-gerente-del-grupo-environmental-Odournet/| accessdate =8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Odournet GmbH (Kiel) and Odournet BV (Amsterdam) left the Odournet group and became Olfasense. Van Harreveld resumed his function as CEO at Odournet.&lt;ref name="OloresSplit"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =Odournet Group splits into Olfasense and Odournet  | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =Olores | date =22 December 2015 | url =http://olores.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=495:odournet-group-splits-into-olfasense-and-odournet&amp;catid=16&amp;Itemid=504&amp;lang=en| accessdate =29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==

Odournet provides odor management consultancy and odor assessments. Its services can be categorized into four areas: environmental odor management; product and material testing; odour measurement equipment; and calibration and proficiency testing for other odor labs. A large portion of the company's revenue derives from environmental odor management as many companies in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] must adhere to odor emissions guidelines.&lt;ref name="BSOpp"&gt;{{cite news | last=Rao| first=Rakesh| title =Dutch firm Odournet smells big opportunity in odour management in India| newspaper =[[Business Standard]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =22 May 2015 | url =http://www.business-standard.com/content/b2b-chemicals/dutch-firm-Odournet-smells-big-opportunity-in-odour-management-in-india-115052201179_1.html| accessdate =8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company uses olfactometers, [[Chromatography|gas chromatographs]], and [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometers]] to isolate and identify the prevalence of odors in a given environment. They also use trained professionals to identify odors.&lt;ref name="UAB"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =Odournet establishes itself in the UAB Research Park | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]]| date =16 November 2011 | url =http://www.uab.cat/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&amp;cid=1096476786473&amp;pagename=UAB%2FPage%2FTemplatePlanaDivsNoticiesdetall&amp;noticiaid=1321428745840| accessdate =8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain cases, the company may be asked to simply identify the source of an odor. For instance, in 2003, [[Ireland]]'s [[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)|Environmental Protection Agency]] hired Odournet to identify a distinctive scent in the town of [[Shannon, County Clare|Shannon]].&lt;ref name="Irish"&gt;{{cite news | last=Deegan| first=Gordon| title =Odour consultant appointed to trace smell in Shannon| newspaper =[[The Irish Times]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =22 May 2003 | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-24677016.html| accessdate =8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, Odournet will employ odor panelists whose job is to simply identify "nuisance odors." Odors that are intense or particularly bad may be labeled "nuisance odors." Smells are collected with pumps and plastic odor bags and must be analyzed within 30 hours of collection.&lt;ref name="BBCJob"&gt;{{cite news | last=Jones| first=Sarah| title =Average noses wanted in Wiltshire | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =[[BBC]] | date =17 September 2009 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/wiltshire/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8260000/8260556.stm| accessdate =8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bath"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =A job that has to be sniffed at| newspaper =[[Bath Chronicle]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =24 September 2009 | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-20805212.html| accessdate =8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Odournet labs are also used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess odors in particular products and materials, including pharmaceuticals, chemicals, automotive products, foods, personal care products, fragrances, appliances, and more.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite news | last=| first=| title =Dutch Odournet Group sets up odour lab in Goa| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[Yahoo]]| date =16 July 2015 | url =https://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/dutch-Odournet-group-sets-odour-053617366.html| accessdate =8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operational planning''' is the process of planning [[Strategic goal (military)|strategic goals]] and objectives to tactical goals and objectives. It describes milestones, conditions for success and explains how, or what portion of, a strategic plan will be put into operation during a given operational period, in the case of commercial application, a fiscal year or another given budgetary term. An operational plan is the basis for, and justification of an annual operating budget request. Therefore, a five-year strategic plan would typically require five operational plans funded by five operating budgets.

Operational plans should establish the activities and budgets for each part of the organization for the next 1 – 3 years. They link the strategic plan with the activities the organization will deliver and the resources required to deliver them. 

An operational plan draws directly from agency and program strategic plans to describe agency and program missions and goals, program objectives, and program activities. Like a strategic plan, an operational plan addresses four questions:
*Where are we now?
*Where do we want to be?
*How do we get there?
*How do we measure our progress?

The operations plan is both the first and the last step in preparing an operating budget request. As the first step, the operations plan provides a plan for resource allocation; as the last step, the OP may be modified to reflect policy decisions or financial changes made during the budget development process. 

Operational plans should be prepared by the people who will be involved in implementation. There is often a need for significant cross-departmental dialogue as plans created by one part of the organization inevitably have implications for other parts.

Operational plans should contain:
*clear objectives 
*activities to be delivered 
*quality standards 
*desired outcomes 
*staffing and resource requirements 
*implementation timetables 
*a process for monitoring progress

| name=Rafael Resnick Brenner
| nationality= [[Argentina]]
| occupation= Lawyer, businessman, and politician
}}'''Rafael Resnick Brenner''' is an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] lawyer and businessman who served as chief of staff of the Federal Administration of Public Revenue (Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos, or AFIP) from 2009 to 2011. He is one of the six defendants in the [[Boudougate]] case.

Resnick Brenner was unknown to the general public until Boudougate. He is accused of being responsible for managing an “outrageous” payment plan whereby the government would pay 240 million pesos that was owed by the printing firm Ciccone Calcográfica to a collection agency.&lt;ref name=salt&gt;{{cite web| title =Echegaray: extorsiones en el norte argentino | work =Salta Entre Lineas| date =| url =http://www.saltaentrelineas.com/echegaray-extorsiones-en-el-norte-argentino/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Resnick Brenner was born in 1963 or 1964.&lt;ref name=salt/&gt; In the 1990s he bought an apartment in the Belgrano district of [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name=todos&gt;{{cite web| title =Quien es Rafael Resnick Brenner?| work =Todo Salta| date =Feb 7, 2014| url =http://www.todosalta.com/web/quien-es-rafael-resnick-brenner/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Club de Campo Pueyrredón===
As of January 1999, he was president of the Club de Campo Pueyrredón, an exclusive residential area along the [[Pan American Highway]] near the city of Pilar. “The idea is to be able to live in peace without being inside a prison. It doesn't have to be a fortress to make you feel secure,” Resnick Brenner said about the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Intento de robo y tiroteo con la guardia de un country en Pilar| work =La Nacion| date =Jan 18, 1999| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/124960-intento-de-robo-y-tiroteo-con-la-guardia-de-un-country-en-pilar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adevifta===
As of 2007, Resnick Brenner was working with Adevifta, the Argentinian Association for the Defense of Family Housing. Adevifra is a group of homeowners with mortgage debts dating back to the 1980s.&lt;ref name=ipro&gt;{{cite web| title =Banco Hipotecario, comprometido por bolsa de Miceli| work =iProfesional| date =Jul 19, 2007| url =http://www.iprofesional.com/notas/49972-Banco-Hipotecario-comprometido-por-bolsa-de-Miceli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources identify him as director of that organization, while others described him as council for Adevifra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Dema| first =Veronica| title =Fracasa el fondo fiduciario para evitar ejecuciones hipotecarias| work =La Nacion| date =Sep 5, 2007| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/940974-fracasa-el-fondo-fiduciario-para-evitar-ejecuciones-hipotecarias}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, Resnick Brenner filed a complaint on behalf of Adevifra against two former Economy Ministers, [[Eduardo Elsztain]] and [[Felisa Miceli]], accusing them of fraud and “breach of the duties of public officials to the detriment of public administration.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Miceli y el Banco Hipotecario investigados por maniobras| work =infobae| date =Aug 8, 2007| url =http://www.infobae.com/2007/08/08/330867-miceli-y-el-banco-hipotecario-investigados-maniobras}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the defendants were charged with involvement in a scheme whereby home purchasers receiving mortages from the [[Hipotecario Bank]] were diverted to law firms that doubled or tripled their down payments.&lt;ref name=ipro/&gt;

===AFIP===
In 2009, Resnick Brenner was hired as chief of staff of the Federal Administration of Public Revenue (Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos, or AFIP).&lt;ref name=todos/&gt; His superior was [[Ricardo Echegaray]], whom he had met at a rugby club.&lt;ref name=copl&gt;{{cite web| title =Confirman el procesamiento de Resnick Brenner por Ciccone| work =El Acople| date =Feb 20, 2015| url =http://www.elacopleinformativo.com.ar/salta/7166-confirman-el-procesamiento-de-resnick-brenner-por-ciccone.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time he began the job, he had assets of 26,300 pesos. By 2010, according to information presented to the Anticorruption Office, Resnick Brenner had increased his assets by 4100%.&lt;ref name=todos/&gt;&lt;ref name=perf&gt;{{cite web| last =Delfino| first =Emilia| title =Resnick Brenner, el asesor de Echegaray que lo compromete en la causa Ciccone| work =Perfil| date =Aug 11, 2012| url =http://www.perfil.com/ediciones/politica/-20128-701-0074.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was chief of staff of AFIP until June 2011.&lt;ref name=afip&gt;{{cite web| last =Pizzi| first =Nicolas| title =Un funcionario de la AFIP dice que Nuñez Carmona fue a una reunión por Ciccone como representante de Boudou| work =Clarin| date =Jun 12, 2014| url =http://www.clarin.com/politica/Amado_Boudou-caso_Ciccone-Riesnick_Brenner-Reinwick_0_1155484790.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ciccone scandal==
Resnick Brenner was a key figure in the AFIP at the time of the [[Ciccone scandal]].&lt;ref name=todos/&gt; On October 19, 2010, the AFIP approved of the lifting of the bankruptcy of Argentina's largest printing firm, Ciccone Calcográfica, and agreed on a payment plan that would permit the firm to resume printing.&lt;ref name=conf&gt;{{cite web| last =Bertoia| first =Luciana| title =Boudou indictment confirmed| work =Buenos Aires Herald| date =Feb 20, 2015| url =http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/182463/boudou-indictment-confirmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Resnick Brenner who recommended that Ciccone Calcográfica be given a discount on its tax liabilities&lt;ref name=todos/&gt; and who allegedly agreed to a payment plan that benefited Ciccone Calcográfica after it filed for bankruptcy in 2010.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{cite web| title =The other men who will be interrogated in the Ciccone case| work =Buenos Aires Herald| date =May 31, 2014| url =http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/160833/the-other-men-who-will-be-interrogated-in-the-ciccone-case}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Nación'' later determined, based on telephone records, that Resnick Brenner had signed two opinions both of which supported the provision of funds for a payment plan for Ciccone.&lt;ref name=copl/&gt;

At least two government officials challenged Resnick Brenner's action on behalf of Ciccone Calcográfica. The Director of Legal Affairs at the Ministry of Economy, José Guillermo Capdevila, challenged Resnick Brenner and reportedly got into trouble with the AFIP as a result.&lt;ref name=perf/&gt; On November 9, 2010, in defiance of Capdevila, Boudou signed the recommendation to help Ciccone. The next day, Resnick Brenner asked the AFIP's legal department to approve the removal of capital.&lt;ref name=perf/&gt;

Experts stated in August 2012 that Resnick Brenner was more criminally responsible than the director of AFIP, Ricardo Echegaray, because it was he who had acted to remove Ciccone Calcográfica's capital debt in November 2010, which was not a decision that he had any power to make.&lt;ref name=perf/&gt;

It was reported on May 31, 2014, that on July 17, 2014, [[Alejandro Vandenbroele]] and Resnick Brenner would have to appear in court.&lt;ref name=case/&gt; On June 12, 2014, Resnick Brenner was questioned by Judge Ariel Lijo. He presented Lijo with a written statement in which he declared that [[Amado Boudou]], during his tenure as Minister of Economy, had sent his chief adviser, [[César Guido Forcieri]], and his friend [[José María Nuñez Carmona]] to meet with Resnick Brenner to inquire about the procedure for granting Ciccone Calcográfica a payment plan. Resnick Brenner said that he did not remember the date of the meeting. Clarin stated that Resnick Brenner's statement “seriously complicate[d]” matters for Boudou, who had sought to distance himself from the controversy surrounding lifting of the bankruptcy of Ciccone Calcográfica.&lt;ref name=afip/&gt; At his June 12 appearance before Lijo, Resnick Brenner asked the judge to dismiss him from the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Resnick Brenner titular de AFIP-Salta pidió a Lijo su sobreseimiento en causa Ciccone| work =Nuevo Diario| date =Jun 13, 2014| url =http://www.nuevodiariodesalta.com.ar/noticias/7893/resnick-brenner-titular-de-afip-salta-pidio-lijo-s.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resnick Brenner was indicted by Lijo on June 27, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =No waiting: Boudou indicted| work =Buenos Aires Herald| date =Jun 28, 2015| url =http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/163261/no-waiting-boudou-indicted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Federal prosecutor Jorge Di Lello called for Resnick Brenner to be summoned for questioning. On February 19, 2015, Judges Jorge Ballestero, Eduardo Farah, and Eduardo Freiler of the Federal Criminal Appeals Court confirmed Judge Lijo's indictments of Boudou, Núñez Carmona, Alejandro Vandenbroele, [[Nicolás Ciccone]], Resnick Brenner, and Forcieri.&lt;ref name=conf/&gt;

===Salta===
After the Boudougate scandal broke in 2012, according to one source, Brenner was not fired from the AFIP but “ended up being rewarded,” as Hugo Alconada Moon, a columnist for ''La Nación'' and author of a book about Boudougate, stated. Resnick Brenner was put in charge of AFIP in the province of Salta, where he lives. Instead of living in a rented house or apartment, “as is the custom for those officials who are transferred to Salta from other provinces or from the federal capital,” Resnick Brenner was installed at the International Hotel Alejandro I, the province's most exclusive hotel. In August 2014, FM News reported that Resnick Brenner was living at the hotel, a five-star establishment on Belgrano Square in the center of Salta. A week later, Resnick Brenner confirmed that he was living at the hotel but said that he was paying a cheaper rate than people who stayed at the hotel for just a few nights.

In addition to his address in Salta, Resnick Brenner continued to maintain his residences at Club de Campo Pueyrredón and on calle Carlos Pellegrini in Buenos Aires. In addition, AFIP supplied him with a car and chauffeur. Asked about rumors that he was earning 75,000 pesos a month, Resnick Brenner said it was “slander.”

Resnick Brenner's activities in Salta have led to controversy. “From the moment Resnick Brenner took office in Salta,” reports one source, he “launched a well-oiled machinery to squeeze entrepreneurs and farmers,” and began collecting “millions in bribes,” mostly in the vicinity of Oran, where officials of the Federal Court No. 2, located in that town, are suspected of being complicit in his activities. The shakedown process allegedly involves the leveling of false accusations of operational irregularities, such as the use of slave labor, and the issuing of threats of severe sanctions that can only be lifted through the payment of bribes. Resnick Brenner and his cohorts have reportedly “demanded bribes ranging from one million to 10 million pesos, depending on the size of the business or farm.” Some businessmen ended up in prison for several days for resisting Resnick Brenner's extortion efforts.

Among other activities, Resnick Brenner ordered a raid on a 16,000-hectare farm in the department of Oran, and issued a report maintaining that 157 employees had been found to be working in deplorable conditions. In one case in which he claimed to have uncovered the use of slave labor, as well as “a 12-year-old working in very poor condition and people who did not eat for three days,” Resnick Brenner refused to identify the employers in question, purportedly for reasons of “tax secrecy.”&lt;ref name=salt/&gt;

==Taxes==
As of 2014, Resnick Brenner, the former chief of staff of the Argentinian tax agency, was facing “two judgments for unpaid taxes in the province of Buenos Aires.”&lt;ref name=salt/&gt;

'''Ramón Massó Tarruella''' (1928 - 2017) was a Spanish [[Communication|media and communications]] expert and a former [[Carlist]] politician.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Antiga Fabrica Borras i Masso.jpg|thumbnail|190px|left|Borràs &amp; Massó manufacture, [[Mataró]]]]
Ramón Massó Tarruella was born to an established, much branched and well-to-do [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[bourgeoisie]] family. His grandfather, [[Ramón Massó Marcer]], originated from the small seaside town of [[Sant Pere de Ribes]]. In 1885, during rapid expansion of the Catalan [[clothing]] manufacturing, he moved to Barcelona to set up his own business; he started a company specializing in [[dye]]s for the [[textile industry]] (his cousin, [[Ramón Oliveras Massó]], became an academic and taught [[chemistry]] in the Barcelona-based [[Escuela de Ingenieros Industriales]] until 1936). His son, [[Juan Massó Soler]], entered the family business in 1912 and developed it into a successful chemical company. Member of many Catalan commercial and trade institutions, he married Nuria Tarruella Riu.

The couple had 8 children, 3 sons (José Luis, Ramón, Juan Antonio) and 5 daughters (Montserrat, Isabel, Maria Amelia, Pilar and Nuria), all raised in a profoundly [[Catholic]] and traditional ambience. In the 1950s José Luis and Juan Antonio got engaged in the family company and later turned it into [[Comercial Química Massó Sociedad Anónima]], which expanded into new market sectors and remains active until today. In the early 1960s [[John Masso|Juan Antonio]] left the family enterprise and commenced studying [[canon law]], ordained as a [[priest]] in 1965; following his transfer to Australia he later became head ([[Vicar|Regional Vicar]]) of [[Opus Dei]] there, the position retained until his death.

As a child Ramón together with his family fled Barcelona, the city which fell under the [[CNT-FAI|anarchist]] control during the first months of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]]. The family settled in [[San Sebastián]] in the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|nationalist zone]]. The Massó boys joined [[Pelayos (Carlist Youth Organisation)|Pelayos]], the Carlist organization for older children animated mostly by the Catalan emigrees, but terminated their engagement following [[:es:Decreto de Unificación|amalgamation]] of the Carlist and [[Falangist]] juvenile organizations; as a kid Massó took part in the 1937 anti-unification demonstrations, allegedly shouting "death to Franco" and "death to Falange". Following the end of hostilities the family returned to Barcelona, where Ramón together with his brothers became a teenage member of the Catalan Opus Dei.

In late 1940s Massó moved to [[Madrid]] studying Filosofia y Letras to graduate in Philosophy (later he became also Técnico en Publicidad). During his university years he joined [[Agrupación de Estudiantes Tradicionalistas]], a technically illegal though tolerated Carlist student organization. Enraged by increasing marginalization of Carlism within the political realm of the [[Francoist Spain|regime]] he developed his childish anti-Falangist sentiments into a firm anti-Francoist outlook. Engaged in leafleting campaigns and skirmishes against the official [[:es:Sindicato Español Universitario|SEU]] organization, in 1954 Massó (recommended by the Carlist political leader [[Manuel Fal Conde]]) grew to the position of Delegado Nacional of AET.

==Aspiring Carlist==
[[File:Don Javier 1960.jpg|thumbnail|left|170px|Don Javier, 1960]]
Massó was increasingly disappointed by the perceived somnolent atmosphere of the movement's circulos, with the older generation trapped in recollections of the long gone days of glory. Highly emotional semi-clandestine 1956 attempts to dissuade the Carlist [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|claimant]] from a would-be dynastical union with the ''[[Alfonsism|Alfonsinos]]'' and to inspire him towards a decisive policy proved unsuccessful. The Massó-led ''aetistas'', upset with the diffident Don Javier, decided to focus on his eldest son [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Carlos Hugo]], with whom the group found common ground during his brief stay in Madrid en route to Portugal in 1955.
 
Carlos Hugo, at that time a [[French citizen]] completing PhD in economics in [[Oxford]], threw himself into the Spanish politics in liaison with Massó and his team. Following half a year spent quietly in [[Bilbao]] on improving his [[Castellano language|castellano]] and learning Spanish politics (his key tutor Massó just commenced teaching at the local [[Colegio Gaztelueta]]), the prince made a public debut during the annual Carlist amassment at [[Montejurra]] in May 1957. The entry, repeatedly rehearsed, meticulously planned and pre-agreed with the Carlist leadership, turned out to be a masterpiece of public appearance. The unexpected prince's presentation generated exploding enthusiasm of the crowd, excited by youth, optimism and royal firmness of the speaker (though the lecture contained only one reference to God and included phrases sounding like an offer to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]). Massó and his team ensured that ''La Proclama de Montejurra'' gets propagated in the Carlist circulos across Spain. In 1958 Carlos Hugo's speech – again carefully crafted by the prince, Massó and the team – called for profound change, put social issues on the forefront and contained a positive reference to Franco. During the following years the snowballing attendance at Montejurra transformed it from a Carlist-flavored local ''[[Via Crucis]]'' to the largest (save official, religious and football gatherings) public amassment in Francoist Spain. 
[[File:Charles-Hugues de Bourbon-Parme.jpg|thumbnail|180px|Carlos Hugo, 1964]]
The emergence of Carlos Hugo and the ''hugocarlistas'' coincided with the overall change in the Carlist strategy towards Francoism; in 1955 the intransigent Fal Conde was replaced as the movement's leader by a collective governing body, which initiated a new collaborative policy. Tactically Massó also opted for limited collaboration with Francoism (which cost him AET leadership in 1957), judging that gaining room for action is vital for his further aims.  However, while the new Carlist leader [[José María Valiente Soriano|José María Valiente]] sincerely hoped for some sort of prudent partnership between Francoism and Carlism, Massó aimed at dismantling the regime from within. Moreover, while Valiente oriented himself towards the army and bureaucracy, the hugocarlistas approached the hardcore [[syndicalist]] Falange sector, likewise promoting new social order and disdainful towards greedy capitalism.

The collaborative approach appeared to work: in the early 1960s the Carlists were granted a few media and organizational concessions. The ''hugocarlistas'' benefited the most, opening a number of new periodicals turned into their ideological tribunes (mostly ''Azada y asta'' and ''Montejurra''), galvanizing the chain of [[Círculos Culturales Vázquez de Mella]] and launching their own workers' organization, [[Movimiento Obrero Tradicionalista|MOT]], all of them becoming later dissemination channels of their political vision.

==Protagonist Carlist==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|210px|left|the Carlist standard]]
As Carlos Hugo moved to Madrid he organized the young collaborators, dubbed ''camarilla'' and headed by Massó, into his [[Secretaría Politica (of Carlos Hugo)|Secretaría Política]]. The partnership of the old and the young leaders seemed smooth, though some of the former started suspecting the latter of dangerously Leftist ideas. Backed by the aging claimant the ''hugocarlistas'' assumed more powers as the newly established [[Junta de Gobierno (Carlist body)|Junta de Gobierno]] diluted the authority of Valiente. Massó outplayed the chief opponent, [[José Luis Zamanillo González-Camino|José Luis Zamanillo]], marginalized him in 1962–1963 and finally got him expelled early 1964. From this moment on the ''hugocarlistas'' spelled out their vision of Carlism more openly; the same year they published ''Esquema doctrinal'', a lecture which avoided open challenge to Francoism and presented a monarchist [[Corporativism|corporative]] political organization combined with [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and [[Democracy|democratic]] principles. During the 1965 Montejurra the ''hugocarlistas'' voiced their praise of [[socialism]] and even [[Marxism]] at unprecedented levels.

It is not clear whether Massó intended to instaurate the Carlist dynasty by means of new social mobilization or he tried to promote profound transformation using Carlos Hugo as an agent of change; anyway, the two threads became intertwined. The immediate political objective of Massó was to prevent the Alfonsist restoration. The young Carlists dogged the ''juanista niño'', boycotting or jeering [[Juan Carlos]]; they publicly humiliated the royal prince and [[Sofia de Grecia|his wife]] a few times. At the same time, Massó engineered a campaign to promote Carlos Hugo across the country. The operation revealed much understanding of the media role in the [[consumer society]], as it exploited common [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] threads and kept feeding the press with new [[Scoop (term)|scoops]] (the prince as a miner in [[Asturias]], at a [[parachute]] course, at [[Sanfermines]]) and taking advantage of charm and youth of the prince's three sisters. The efforts proved fairly successful, as in the tightly [[Censorship|censured]] media the Borbon-Parmas gained sort of nationwide positive recognition.

The greatest scoop came in 1964, when Carlos Hugo married [[princess Irene of the Netherlands]]. At this point, however, the regime propaganda machine was firmly ordered to backtrack. Franco, though personally delighted that the [[House of Orange-Nassau|Dutch royal family]] (one of the harshest critics of his regime) was publicly humiliated by a Spanish royal hopeful, grew increasingly anxious that the popularity of Carlos Hugo might get him cornered when it comes to an inescapable dynastical decision. Despite wide TV coverage across Western Europe the Spanish media played down the event, which marked hard limits of Massó's strategy and got him bitterly disappointed.

In mid-1960s Massó realized that his strategy had failed; moreover, he realized that Leftist phraseology (with ''socialismo'' and ''autogestión'' most prominent catchwords) had divided and debilitated Carlism. In 1965 he loosened his ties with Carlos Hugo by moving from Madrid to [[Pamplona]], where he commenced teaching at the Opus Dei university. As opposition against his influence mounted from the orthodox [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] camp of Valiente and from the militantly Leftist group of [[José María de Zavala y Castella|José de Zavala]], in 1966 Massó ceased as head of Secretaría Política; in 1967 he and some of his collaborators handed their resignations and withdrew from politics. He remained loosely related to Carlism, e.g. shortly before death taking part in historical conference,

==Media pundit and academic==
[[File:IESE Campus.jpg|thumbnail|left|IESE (contemporary view)]]
In late 1960s Massó settled in Pamplona, working as an academic teacher at [[IESE Business School|Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa]] (IESE), a prestigious business school founded by Opus Dei back in 1958. It was there that he completed the Alta Dirección curriculum himself, a holistic leadership program offered to top corporate managers. Finally disillusioned with Opus Dei and with its role during the process of installing Juan Carlos as the future king of Spain, Massó broke with the organization and moved to Barcelona. In his native city he joined [[Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona]] (UAB), where he became ''catedratico'' in Departamento de publicidad at the Facultad de Ciencias de la Información.
[[File:Biblioteca Comunicacio UAB.JPG|thumbnail|UAB library]]
Massó's small booklet ''Estrategia para unas extrañas elecciones'' (1977) earned him local media recognition  and triggered co-operation with ''[[La Vanguardia]]''; he became its key politics and public affairs commentator (until 1984). Massó experienced most of the Spanish [[Transition to democracy (Spain)|transition to democracy]] not as a protagonist but as a witness, periodically having a regular column in the Sunday issue. As a press pundit he was careful to remain within the limits of political science and styled himself as an unbiased scholarly observer, though his hostility to Francoism and support for reforms remained evident. In general opposed to [[sectarian]] politics, he occasionally kept referring to [[Lenin]] as a political authority. His commentary suggested also that Massó sort of put up with the royal function of Juan Carlos and with his role in the Spanish transition. In late 1970s together with his former Carlist collaborator [[José Antonio Parilla]] he engaged in the Nono Art publishing house and co-ordinated work on a popular series ''Breu História de Catalunya'' (1979–81).

==Communication expert==
[[File:Sede La Caixa.png|thumbnail|left|''la Caixa'' brand]]
In mid-1970s Massó co-founded Alas, one of the first media agencies in Spain and became head of its Barcelona branch. About the same time he launched the term "politing", intended as a merger of "politics" and "marketing" and meant as a specialized knowledge (if not a science itself) on the crossroads of [[social sciences]], [[public relations]] and [[politics]]. His work ''Introducción al “politing”. Lanzamiento de un aspirante'' (1976), apart from gaining official prizes (Premio Markedit, Premio Instituto Nacional de Publicidad), generated also significant interest among the academics, politicians and commentators.  The book was formatted as a systematic theoretical lecture on the basics of [[political marketing]], though it contained many explicit and implicit references to the 1957–1967 political experiences of the author. Relative success of launching Carlos Hugo became one of Masso's key credentials as a scholar in public relations and as a businessman running commercial (he claims authorship of [[La Caixa]] brand) and social (e.g. cancer awareness) media campaigns. He followed with another book, ''De la magia a la artesanía: el politing del cambio español''  (1980), becoming a nationwide recognised scholar and giving courses organised by [[Sociedad Española de Anunciantes]], I[[nstituto Nacional de Publicidad]] or [[Escuela Oficial de Radio y Television]].
[[File:Alblog5.png|thumbnail|communication model (sample)]]
In the 1990s Massó switched his focus to media with ''El exito de la cultura light: Anuncios y noticias'' (1993) and ''Noticias frente a hechos: Entender la realidad despues de leer los periodicos'' (1997). Later on he broadened his interest into the wider realm of public communication, focusing on combined multidimensional holistic forms and channels of information exchange named "integral communication". He co-founded the Barcelona-based [[Institut de Comunicació Integral]], an independent college specializing in [[marketing]], [[Brand|brand communications]] and [[public relations]], and became its president. ICOMI turned out to be a commercial (though not necessarily scientific) success and became a fashionable educational institute (incorporated into [[Abat Oliba CEU University|Universidad Abad Oliva CEU]] in 2003). During the last decade Massó published successive books on culture, communications and politics: ''Otro rey para España: crónica del lanzamiento y fracaso de Carlos Hugo'' (2004), ''Los últimos días de la Telecracia'' (with Enrique Nebot, 2009), ''Nacimiento y muerte de las marcas'' (with Joaquín García-Lavernia Gil, 2010), ''Navegando por el cachondeo de la historia'' (2012) and even a children's book, ''La segunda vida de Don Jos Kintana'' (1999). He maintaied [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] accounts, scarcely active during last years of his life.

==Reception==
[[File:Formal dinner in honour of King Juan Carlos 2 (crop).jpg|thumbnail|180px|left|Juan Carlos de Borbón]]
In the 1990s, looking back on his political past, Massó admitted defeat at the hands of a competitive group of [[Machiavellian]] players coming from the same Opus Dei hotbed (especially [[Laureano López Rodó|López Rodó]]), who outplayed him by dismantling Francoism with technocratic strategy and with Juan Carlos as a better marketed and better designed version of Carlos Hugo. He denied charges that he had implanted Marxism within the Carlist realm; he rather pointed to the Juan Vázquez de Mella heritage, based on ''sociedalismo'' and the concept of [[:es:Democracia orgánica|organic society]].
 
In historiography Massó remains a rather divisive and ambiguous figure, with little agreement as to his role and intentions. Some historians (Payne, Bartyzel) maintain that he unleashed forces which either destroyed Carlism or turned it into its own [[antinomy]]. Some historians (Clemente, Martorell Pérez) claim that he helped to safeguard Carlist identity or at least contributed to emphasizing genuine Carlism and sidetracking its accidental threads.  Some historians (MacClancy, Caspistegui Gorasurreta) suggest that he commenced the process of redirecting Carlism from traditional and orthodox path to a new formula. Some historians (Perez-Nievas) do not consider Massó worth mentioning and present de Zavala as the leader of the group.

According to one group of studies (Martorell Pérez, MacClancy) Massó was primarily motivated by dynastical objectives, according to another (Clemente) he was not a monarchist at all. There are scholars (Bartyzel) who consider him a radical Leftist approximate to Marxism, there are others (Clemente) who consider him a "neocapitalist technocrat". Certain works (Martorell Pérez, in line with Masso's own later narration) present Carlos Hugo as a politician invented and created by Massó, certain works (Clemente) present Massó as Carlos Hugo's sidekick, useful at one political phase and to be replaced at the following one. Massó's departure from politics is explained by failure of his policy (Martorell Pérez), by Carlos Hugo's decision to replace him (Clemente), by his alleged falling in love with one of Carlos Hugo's sisters (Fraga), by pressure from Opus Dei (Lavardín), by combined efforts of enemies from the Right like Valiente and from the Left like de Zavala (Pérez Madrigal) or by pure greed (Zabala).
[[File:Carlism, Concepts, Context and Time.jpg|thumbnail|Carlist concepts over time]]
One thing most historians agree on is that Massó proved instrumental in dismantling Traditionalist Carlism (though they do not agree whether a non-Traditionalist Carlism can actually exist). None of the currently operating Carlist grouplets admits deference to Massó. Traditionalists ([[Carloctavismo|carloctavistas]], [[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma|sixtinos]], [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista|CTC]]) tend to view him as a turncoat, the progressives ([[Carlist Party (1970)|Partido Carlista]], [[Carlos, Duke of Parma|javierocarlistas]]) tend to view him as merely a former [[:ru:Попутчик (жаргон)|fellow-traveller]].

Before death he dedicated his future corpse to scientific research, and hence there was no funeral arranged and there is no grave. His death was acknowledged on few websites related to Partido Carlista, though not by major Spanish media.

==Biography==
Saeid Esmaeilzadeh was born in [[Tehran]] and moved to [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] with his family at the age of 8, living in the suburb of [[Husby, Stockholm|Husby]] northwest of the city.&lt;ref&gt;'' Månadens Stockholmare, Stockholms Stad, http://www.stockholm.se/Fristaende-webbplatser/Fackforvaltningssajter/Stadsledningskontoret/Manadens-stockholmare/Tidigare-manadens-stockholmare/2011/&lt;/ref&gt; His younger sister is neuroscientist and entrepreneur [[Mouna Esmaeilzadeh]]. Esmaeilzadeh started his academic career at [[Stockholm University]] where he studied [[Chemistry]] and [[History of Religions|History of Religion]], before beginning graduate studies at the age of 21. In 2000 he defended his PhD thesis: Crystal Chemistry of Manganese Tantalum Oxides.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Crystal chemistry of manganese tantalum oxides |first=Saeid |last=Esmaeilzadeh  |publisher=Institutionen för fysikalisk kemi, oorganisk kemi och strukturkemi |location=Stockholm |year=2000 |isbn=91-7265-047-8 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Esmaeilzadeh became Sweden’s youngest associate professor at the age of 28, at the same university.&lt;ref&gt;'' Entrepenörskapsforum, http://entreprenorskapsforum.se/natverk/naringspolitiskt-forum/foretagsbyggare-med-35-arsplan/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research ==
After his PhD Esmaeilzadeh worked on a project that set out to study crystals based on [[silicon nitride]].&lt;ref&gt;'' Fakultetsnytt Stockholms Universitet, nr 2, 2006, http://www.science.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.34938.1320940134!/nr2NY_fakultetsnytt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the experiment, silicon nitride was smelted with additives at high temperatures and was then allowed to cool slowly so that crystals formed in the 1,500 to 2,000 degrees [[Celsius]] range. One night something unexpected happened when the cooling system of the furnace malfunctioned, shutting the furnace down and leading the melt to rapidly solidify. This resulted in a small yellowish transparent piece of glass instead of crystals.&lt;ref&gt;'' Vetenskapsrådet, forskarporträtt, {{cite web |url=http://www.vr.se/forskningvistodjer/forskarportratt/aldreintervjuermedforskare/hansexperimentmissleddetillsuperglas.4.2d90e1b81116cee9c4e80002508.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831183508/http://www.vr.se/forskningvistodjer/forskarportratt/aldreintervjuermedforskare/hansexperimentmissleddetillsuperglas.4.2d90e1b81116cee9c4e80002508.html |archivedate=2010-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He gradually discovered that he had created a completely new [[Silicate glass|material]]. He had managed to find a way to produce [[nitride]]-based glass materials with high nitrogen content. It became apparent that the material had high chemical flexibility and that it easily combined with other substances such as metals, while being much harder and having higher [[thermal resistance]]. It also became apparent that it had interesting magnetic properties as well as a [[refractive index]] nearly as high as that of diamonds. Saeid Esmaeilzadeh applied for a patent for the new glass material and brought on childhood friend and business partner [[Ashkan Pouya]] to develop what would ultimately become the materials firm Diamorph AB.&lt;ref&gt;'' SVT Vetenskap, Forskarporträtt, (på Vinnovas hemsida) {{cite web |url=http://www.vinnova.se/sv/Resultat/Filmen-Livsviktigt/Hart-glas/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829224732/http://vinnova.se/sv/Resultat/Filmen-Livsviktigt/Hart-glas/ |archivedate=2013-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Phantom innovation" and "the creative dance"==
In 2008, Esmaeilzadeh − together with his colleague [[Ashkan Pouya]] − published a report by the name of “Phantom Innovation - A Launching Pad for Innovation Processes” that researches and describes the non-linear nature of innovative processes.&lt;ref&gt;'' Link, https://www.academia.edu/323938/The_Phantom_Innovation_a_Launching_Pad_for_Innovation_Processes&lt;/ref&gt; In this report the expression “phantom innovation” was coined. This term describes the phenomenon that an idea or technical solution at its conception often differs significantly from what ultimately becomes the final innovation that is brought to market. In the report, the pair came to the conclusion that the initial innovation is often changed on the way to commercialization (“the creative dance”) and in many cases is introduced to a different market or fulfills a different need than that which is originally envisaged.

That same year Saeid and Ashkan both won the prize for the "Best Student Paper" at the [[ISPIM]] (The International Society for Professional Innovation Management) Symposium in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;ISPIM, http://www.ispim.org/index.php/publications#ui-publication-tab4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serendipity Group==
Together, Esmaeilzadeh − with his background in research − and Pouya − with his background in business − founded Serendipity innovations in 2004. Esmaeilzadeh is the firm’s CEO, and has participated in and founded a number of innovative companies based on leading academic research. In all, the two have founded over 15 companies within the fields of [[medical device]], [[biotechnology]], [[Advanced composite materials (engineering)|advanced materials]], [[clean tech]] and [[information technology]]. These companies include [[NASDAQ OMX]]-listed Episurf Medical,&lt;ref&gt;'' NasdaqOMX, pressmeddelande, http://ir.nasdaqomx.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=599298&lt;/ref&gt; a medical technology company that designs and manufactures individually customized implants for cartilage damage in joints, Diamorph, AB&lt;ref&gt;'' Diamorph AB, hemsida, http://iwww.diamorph.com/.&lt;/ref&gt; an advanced materials company, and OrganoClick a clean technology-company which develops environmentally friendly chemicals for treatment of wood and textiles. OrganoClick has among other awards, received the "Environmental Innovation of the year"&lt;ref&gt;'' OrganoClick, press release, http://organoclick.com/index.php/news-reader/items/organoclick-wins-environmental-innovation-award.html&lt;/ref&gt;  in 2008 and was in 2010 admitted&lt;ref&gt;'' OrganoClick, press release, http://organoclick.com/index.php/news-reader/items/33.html&lt;/ref&gt; to "WWF Climate Solver Programme ".&lt;ref&gt;'' Website,  http://www.climatesolver.org{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Xbrane Biopharma AB&lt;ref&gt;'' Xbrane  BiopharmaAB, website, http://www.xbrane.com&lt;/ref&gt; is a biopharmaceutical company specialized in high demand complex generics. The company has world leading expertise in developing biogenerics for injectable controlled release drugs and proprietary high-yield protein expression technology for the development of biosimilars.

==Selected awards==
Esmaeilzadeh was awarded the 2008 Chemistry Technology Prize (Swedish: Kemiteknikpris), 1&amp;nbsp;kg of silver, from Sveriges Kemiingenjörers Riksförening.&lt;ref&gt;'' SR Swedish Public Radio, http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=412&amp;artikel=2169100/{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the prize for his work with materials development.

In 2010 Esmaeilzadeh was awarded, together with Ashkan Pouya, the [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|H.M King Carl XVI Gustaf]]  "Innovative Pioneer of the Year" award (Swedish: Årets Nybyggare Pionjär).&lt;ref&gt;Stiftelsen IFS utmärkelse Årets Nybyggare, {{cite web |url=http://www.ifs.a.se/en/Nyheter/nybyggareriks2010/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030171817/http://www.ifs.a.se/en/Nyheter/nybyggareriks2010/ |archivedate=2010-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the prize for the following reasons: "Ashkan Pouya and Saeid Esmaeilzadeh began with two empty hands, building up an organization with 8 constituent companies that all have products and services with world-leading technology. They have developed a business model that has in recent years generated returns much greater than the industry average, during a period characterized by the largest economic and stock market downturn in 50 years. With great commitment and dedication, these two young entrepreneurs have managed to win acceptance for their business model among leading researchers. Their vision is grand: to be among the largest listed companies in Sweden in 10 years."

In 2011 Esmaeilzadeh won "[[:sv:Månadens stockholmare|Stockholmer of the Month]]" for the following reasons: "Sweden's youngest associate professor. One of 50 Swedes who are going to change the world. Saeid Esmaeilzadeh has received significant praise, awards and distinctions for his research and for his work as an entrepreneur."&lt;ref&gt;Månadens Stockholmare, http://www.stockholm.se/-/Nyheter/Om-Stockholm/Vi-far-inte-nonchalera-klimathotet1/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6944">In [[computing]] and specifically [[peer-to-peer file sharing]], '''seeding''' is the uploading of already [[download]]ed content for others to download from. A [[peering|peer]], a [[computer]] that is connected to the [[computer network|network]], becomes a seed when having acquired the entire set of [[data]] it tries to download. This data consists out of small parts so that seeds can effectively share their content with other peers, handing out the missing pieces. A peer deliberately chooses to become a seed by leaving the upload task active when content is downloaded. This means that there should be motivation to seed. The opposite of a seed is a [[leech (computing)|leech]], a peer that downloads more than they upload.

[[File:Seeding (computing).gif|thumb|400x150px|This shows in a simplified way when one seeds.]]

== Background ==
Seeding is a practice within peer-to-peer file sharing, a [[content distribution model]] that connects computers with the use of a [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) software program in order to share desired content. An example of such a peer-to-peer software program is [[BitTorrent]]. Peer-to-peer file sharing is different from the [[client-server model]], where content is directly distributed from its [[server (computing)|server]] to a [[client (computing)|client]]. To make peer-to-peer file sharing function effectively, content is divided into parts of 256 kilobyte (KB). This [[segmented downloading]] makes the parts that peers miss be allocated by seeds. It also makes downloads go faster, as content can be exchanged between peers. All peers (including seeds) sharing the same content are called a [[segmented downloading|swarm]].&lt;ref name="bera"&gt;Bera, D., Esposito, F., Matta, I., Michiardi, P. (2011). ''On The Impact Of Seed Scheduling In Peer-To-Peer Networks.'' Computer Science Department, Boston University&lt;/ref&gt;

Data shared via peer-to-peer file sharing contains shared file content, computing cycles and disk storage, among other resources.&lt;ref name="ahmad"&gt;As-Sayid-Ahmad, L., Hawa, M., Khalif, L. (2012). ''On Enhancing Reputation Management Using Peer-To-Peer Interaction History.'' Springer Science and Business Media&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations ==
In peer-to-peer file sharing, the strength of a swarm depends on user behaviour, as peers ideally upload more than they download. This is done by seeding, and there are different motivations to do this. There are two popular motivations to seed, of which one is the reputation-based incentive mechanism and the other is the [[tit for tat]] mechanism. As the name reveals, the former is based on the reputation of a peer, meaning that those peers who have a good reputation will get a better treatment from the uploader.&lt;ref name="ahmad" /&gt; The tit for tat mechanism prevents peers from downloading content if they do not upload to the peers they download from. The latter forces a peer to upload.&lt;ref&gt;Hajek, B., Zhu, Ji. (2011). ''The Missing Piece Syndrome In Peer-To-Peer Communication.'' Department of Electrical And Computer Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

Although seeding is only a social norm, some scholars see the practice of uploading parts of the data bulk to others as a duty, claiming that “downloaders are forced to reward uploads in order to compensate for their resource consumption and encourage further altruistic behaviour.”&lt;ref name="ahmad" /&gt; Other scholars are milder and believe that a group of highly motivated seeders could already provide a notion of fairness by scheduling when to seed, uploading more effectively.&lt;ref name="bera" /&gt;

== Threats ==
Leechers, peers that download more than they upload, are a threat to peer-to-peer file sharing and the practice of seeding. Where the goal of seeding is to upload more than to download, thus contributing to the sharing of content, leechers stop uploading as soon as their download is finished. What this means is that seeders must upload more parts of the data bulk in order to guarantee a healthy download. Leeching is also referred to as free-riding, temporal downloading users that, by not seeding, do not support the distribution of content.

Although leeching is a threat to peer-to-peer sharing and an opposite of seeding, it is not regarded as an immediate problem. With downloads rising, upload is still guaranteed, though few contributors in the system account for most services.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, S., Jin, H., Liao, X., Yao, H., Huang, Q., Tu, X. (2009). ''Measuring Web Feature Impacts In Peer-To-Peer File Sharing Systems.'' Hushing University of Science and Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opportunities ==
Research sees opportunities for seeding as a practice that caters contribution within peer-to-peer file sharing and the distribution of content in the digital world in general. A term for this is economic traffic management (ETM), which is concerned with traffic management solutions to involve all peers, both seeder and leecher. It is ETM’s goal to unite peers that have different objectives and to make the sharing of content with peer-to-peer file sharing more efficient. Locality awareness is raised as the most promising concepts by scholars. This entails stimulating peers to seed downloads in their neighbourhood, which speeds up the upload speed and saves [[inter-domain]] traffic over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Despotovic, Z., Hossfeld, T., Kellerer, W., Lehrieder, F., Oechsner, S., Michel, M. (2011). ''Mitigating Unfairness In Locality-Aware Peer-To-Peer Networks.'' International Journal of Network Management&lt;/ref&gt;
Other opportunities that have arisen out of research are to schedule seeding&lt;ref name="bera"/&gt; and use models that reduce the [[electric energy consumption|power consumption]] of seeding computers.&lt;ref&gt;Hlavacs, H., Wiedlich, R., Treutner, T. (2011). ''Energy efficient peer-to-peer file sharing.'' Springer Science and Business Media&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==
Peer-to-peer file sharing and, with that, seeding, is known as a platform for illegal content. With the sharing being done between peers all over the world, there is no supervision. Control over illegal or manipulated content is therefore difficult. Seeding is a part of this and a peer can therefore be involved in helping other peers download illegal content.&lt;ref&gt;Halldorson, U., Hasslinger, G., Sigurdsson, M. (2007). ''Potentials And Challenges Of Peer-To-Peer Based Content Distribution.'' Telematics And Informatics 24&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand there are also examples of mainstream applications that use peer-to-peer file sharing. [[Skype]] and other [[real-time communication]] systems are examples.

'''Sleepy Hollow''' is a village in the town of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]], in [[Westchester County, New York]]. The village is located on the east bank of the [[Hudson River]], about {{convert|30|mi}} north of [[New York City]], and is served by the [[Philipse Manor (Metro-North station)|Philipse Manor]] stop on the [[Metro-North]] [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]].  To the south of Sleepy Hollow is the village of [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], and to the north and east are unincorporated parts of Mount Pleasant. The population of the village at the 2010 census was 9,870.&lt;ref name="Census 2010"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov| title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Sleepy Hollow village, New York| website=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally incorporated as '''North Tarrytown''' in the late 19th century, in 1996 the village officially adopted the traditional name for the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=North Tarrytown Votes to Pursue Its Future as Sleepy Hollow |first=Joseph |last=Berger |authorlink=Joseph Berger (author) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/11/nyregion/north-tarrytown-votes-to-pursue-its-future-as-sleepy-hollow.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 11, 1996 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The village is known to many via "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]", a short story about the local area and its infamous specter, the [[Headless Horseman]], written by [[Washington Irving]], who lived in Tarrytown and is buried in [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]].

The village is home to the [[Philipsburg Manor House]] and the [[Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow]], as well as the [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]], where in addition to [[Washington Irving]], numerous [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery#Notable burials|other notable people]] are buried.

==History==
[[File:Philipsburg Manor, Sleepy Hollow, New York.JPG|thumb|left|[[Philipsburg Manor House]] at the Upper Mills]]
The land that would become Sleepy Hollow was first bought from [[Adriaen van der Donck]], a [[patroon]] in [[New Netherland]] before the English takeover in 1664. Starting in 1672 [[Frederick Philipse]] began acquiring large parcels of land mainly in today's southern Westchester County. Comprising some {{convert|52000|acre|sqmi}} of land, it was bounded by the [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]], the [[Croton River]], the [[Hudson River]], and the [[Bronx River]]. Philipse was granted a royal charter in 1693, creating the [[Manor of Philipsburg]] and establishing him as first lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Eisenstadt |first=Peter |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the State of New York |title=New York State: An Introduction |edition=First |year=2005 |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |location=[[Syracuse, New York]] |isbn=0-8156-0808-X |pages=1199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In today's Sleepy Hollow he established an upper mill and shipping depot, today part of the [[Philipse Manor House]] historic site.  A pious man, he was architect and financier of the town's [[Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow|Old Dutch Church]], said also to have built the pulpit with his own hands.&lt;ref&gt;''Edited Appletons Encyclopedia, Famous Americans'': Biography of Frederick Philipse: "...He worked at the carpenter's trade for several years, aided in building the Old Dutch church, and is said to have made the pulpit with his own hands.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Philipse died in 1702, the manor was divided between his son, [[Adolphus Philipse]], and his grandson, [[Frederick Philipse II]]. Adolph received the Upper Mills property, which extended from [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]] to the Croton River. Frederick II was given the Lower Mills at the confluence of the [[Saw Mill River|Saw Mill]] and Hudson Rivers, the two parcels being reunited on his uncle's death. His son, [[Frederick Philipse III|Frederick III]], became the third lord of the manor in 1751.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Maika |first=Dennis J. |editor=Peter Eisenstadt |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the State of New York |title=Philipsburg Manor |edition=First |year=2005 |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |location=[[Syracuse, New York]] |isbn=0-8156-0808-X |pages=1199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1779, Frederick Philipse III, a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]], was [[Bill of attainder|attained]] for treason, The manor was confiscated and sold at [[public auction]], split between 287 buyers. The largest tract of land (about {{convert|750|acre|ha}}) was at the Upper Mills; it passed to numerous owners until 1951, when it was acquired by [[Historic Hudson Valley|Sleepy Hollow Restorations]]. Thanks to the philanthropy of [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], about {{convert|20|acre|ha}} were restored as today's historic site.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;

The '''Superannuation Complaints Tribunal''' is an independent statutory body established by the [[Australian Government]] to deal with complaints about superannuation (and certain life insurance annuities).

== History==

The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal was established under the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act in 1993.  It was established at the same time as a new prudential and disclosure framework was put in place under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, protecting employees compulsory superannuation contributions (introduced in 1992).

==Operation of the Tribunal==

In order for the Tribunal to deal with a complaint, a member (former member or potential beneficiary) of a superannuation fund must first make a formal complaint to the Trustee of that fund (under the fund's own internal complaints procedures).  If the complaint is not resolved to the member's satisfaction (or has not been dealt with within a 90-day period) then a complaint can be made to the Tribunal.

The Tribunal will only deal with complaints as they relate to a trustee decision affecting an individual member. The Tribunal cannot deal with complaints about the fund as a whole (e.g. poor investment performance). [http://www.sct.gov.au/Making_a_complaint/default.asp?images=b] 

The Tribunal will first try and resolve the complaint through conciliation (where the SCT will facilitate a discussion with all parties involved).

If conciliation is not successful, the Tribunal will make a "review" decision that is binding on all parties.

From July 1, 2018, the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) will replace the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT) and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7100">'''Theophilus Cazenove''', or '''Theophile Cazenove''' (13 October 1740 – 6 March 1811), was a Dutch financier and one of the agents of the [[Holland Land Company]].

== Life and career ==

Theophilus Cazenove was born in [[Amsterdam]] on 13 October 1740, as the son of Théophile Cazenove and Marie de Rapin-Thoyras, French/Swiss [[Huguenots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huguenot-manakin.org/manakin/brock1.php|title=Huguenot Society FMCV - Documents relating to the Hugenot Emigration|work=huguenot-manakin.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a merchant and banker in Bordeaux, Saint Petersburg, [[Archangelsk]], Stockholm and the West-Indies; in 1759 he lost four ships loaded with sugar and coffee, which were taken by a Bristol [[privateer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7QPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA925 |title=Miscellaneous Correspondence, Containing a Variety of Subjects, Relative to Natural and Civil History, Geography, Mathematics, Poetry, Memoirs of Monthly Occurrences, Catalogues of New Books, &amp;c. |first=Benjamin |last=Martin |date=1759 |page=925}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1760 the elder Théophile gave up his business and his sons Charles and Theophile assumed control of the company. In 1763, Theophile married Margaretha Helena van Jever, the daughter of a tradesman in Russia, and a member of the [[vroedschap]]. Cazenove spent his early career in commercial transactions in France and Russia, but went broke in 1770. In the same year, his portrait was painted by [[Jean-Baptiste Perronneau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.bm-lyon.fr/BML_01ICO001014cd411e7e7d29?&amp;query&amp;#91;&amp;#93;=subject:%22Mus%C3%A9e%20lyonnais%20des%20arts%20d%C3%A9coratifs%20%28Lyon%29%22&amp;hitStart=13&amp;hitTotal=14&amp;hitPageSize=16|title=Photographes en Rhône-Alpes::Chambre de Commerce de Lyon ; Musée des Arts décoratifs : J. -B.

In 1788 he collaborated with [[Étienne Clavière]] and [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]], who both traveled to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warville|first1=Jacques-Pierre Brissot de|last2=Clavière|first2=Étienne|title=New Travels in the United States of America: Including The Commerce of America with Europe; Particularly with France and Great Britain. In Two Volumes|date=1994|publisher=J.S. Jordan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbUVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA149 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1789 Cazenove was retained by [[Wilheim Willink|Pieter Stadnitski]] to travel to the United States to act as an investment agent for Stadnitski and other Dutch investors ([[Nicolaas van Staphorst|Nicolaas and Jacob Van Staphorst]], Pieter &amp; Christiaen [[Van Eeghen]], and Ten Cate &amp; Vollenhoven).&lt;ref&gt;http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/archieven/archiefbank/overzicht/333.nl.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onserfdeel.be/nl/uit_archief_detail.asp?artikel_id=14060&lt;/ref&gt; Casenove settled in at [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]] in [[Philadelphia]], where he dealt with financier [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]]; his fellow traveller [[Gerrit Boon]] later went north. Boon believed that harvesting [[maple syrup]] could be a year-round activity, so slavery on the [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s could be avoided.

In 1792 Cazenove invested his clients' money in development bonds issued by the new states and the federal government, after [[Alexander Hamilton]] promised to fully pay the debt. Another venture included investing in large tracts of undeveloped land in [[Genesee County, New York]], which included the [[Holland Purchase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great American Land Bubble |date=1966 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |isbn=9781610162982 |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYBKl5rM2O8C&amp;pg=PA61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to implement these large and difficult purchases (sometimes complicated by the claims of Native Americans), he employed the advisory services of Hamilton and later [[Aaron Burr]].

Cazenove lived well as a "grand seigneur" and was known for his extreme carelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyccazen/Biographies/CazenoveT.html|title=Theophilus Cazenove Biography|work=ancestry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His business dealings in maple syrup and canals were not particularly successful and the investors barely made any profit, even losing money in the Pennsylvania land dealings which he organized with [[James Wilson]].  He was also hard pressed to account for funds that were under his control. During this period he helped [[Antoine Charles Cazenove|his cousin]] from Geneva to settle in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/record.php?id=122503768&amp;contributor=246&amp;archivename=Winterthur+Museum%2C+Garden%2C+and+Library|title=ArchiveGrid : Papers, 1791-1852,.|work=worldcat.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402173505/http://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/record.php?id=122503768&amp;contributor=246&amp;archivename=Winterthur+Museum%2C+Garden%2C+and+Library|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Baring (writer)|Alexander Baring]] wrote: "Cazenove is a sad dirty fellow and does all the mischief he can."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_bij005196001_01/_bij005196001_01_0003.php|title=Bijdragen en Mededelingen van het Historisch Genootschap|volume= 75 |work=dbnl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798 he hired [[Joseph Ellicott]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffaloah.com/h/1799|title=Buffalo 1600-1799|work=buffaloah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Paolo Busti]] became his successor.

Although he became an American citizen in 1794, Cazenove returned to Europe in 1799. In Amsterdam he began to archive purchase of land for the financiers. He left the employment of the Dutch investors in 1802 and sought a position under [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]], who he had met in Philadelphia in 1795, when also Talleyrand invested in land purchase.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cazenovejournal101caze/cazenovejournal101caze_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Cazenove journal, 1794 : a record of the journey of Theophile Cazenove through New Jersey and Pennsylvania"|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cazenove died in Paris in the [[Rue du Bac]].&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

His correspondence along with the records of the Holland Land Company are held in the [[Amsterdam City Archives]].

== Legacy ==
A number of places in New York are named after him, including the [[Cazenovia (village), New York|Village of Cazenovia]], [[Cazenovia (town), New York|Town of Cazenovia]], [[Cazenovia College]], [[Cazenovia Lake]], and [[Cazenovia Creek]].

'''Thomas Francis Bayard Jr.''' (June 4, 1868 – July 12, 1942) was an American lawyer and politician from [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. He was a Democratic U.S. Senator from Delaware in the 1920s.

==Early life and family==
{{see also|Bayard family}}
Bayard was born in Wilmington, Delaware, son of U.S. Senator [[Thomas F. Bayard|Thomas F. Bayard Sr.]] and grandson of U.S. Senator [[James A. Bayard Jr.]] In 1908, he married Elizabeth Bradford [[Du Pont family|du Pont]], and they had five children, Elizabeth, Thomas, Ellen, James, and [[Alexis I. du Pont Bayard|Alexis]]. They were members of the Episcopal Church.

Bayard graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1890, where he was a member of [[Skull and Bones]],&lt;ref name="Yaleobit194243"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mssa.library.yale.edu/obituary_record/1925_1952/1942-43.pdf | title=Obituary Record Of Graduates Of Yale University Deceased During The Year, 1942-1943 | accessdate=March 25, 2011 | date=January 1, 1944 | publisher=Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} attended [[Yale Law School]] and was admitted to the [[Delaware State Bar Association|Delaware Bar]] in 1893. After living in New York City for four years and working as assistant corporation counsel, he returned to his Delaware law practice in 1901.

He married Elizabeth Bradford du Pont on October 4, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Bayard - du Pont |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/10/04/104811105.pdf |quote=At Rencourt, near Greenville, to-day, Miss Elizabeth B. Du Pont, daughter of Alexis Irene Du Pont and the late Dr. Alexis I. Du Pont, was married to Thomas F. Bayard, son of the late Ambassador Bayard. ... |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=October 4, 1908 |accessdate=2012-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as a chairman of the Delaware Democratic Party's state committee from 1906 to 1916, and as solicitor for the city of Wilmington from 1917 until 1919.

==Professional and political career==
Bayard was elected to the U.S. Senate in a special election on November 7, 1922, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of U.S. Senator [[Josiah O. Wolcott]]. On the same day, he was also elected for the full term to follow, in both instances defeating incumbent Republican U.S. Senator [[T. Coleman du Pont]] (a cousin of Bayard's wife), who had been appointed. During this term, he served in the Democratic minority in the last session of the 67th Congress, and in the 68th, 69th, and 70th Congress.

Bayard lost his bid for a second full term in 1928 to Republican [[John G. Townsend Jr.]], the former governor. He then lost another bid for a second full term in 1930 to incumbent Republican U.S. Senator [[Daniel O. Hastings]]. In all, Bayard served one term and part of another, from November 7, 1922, to March 3, 1929, during the administrations of U.S. presidents [[Warren G. Harding]] and [[Calvin Coolidge]]. Subsequently, he resumed his law practice in Wilmington.

==Death and legacy==
Bayard died at Wilmington and is buried there in the [[Old Swedes Episcopal Church Cemetery]]. His son, [[Alexis I. du Pont Bayard]], served as Lieutenant Governor of Delaware from 1949 to 1953.

He is the namesake of the town of [[Bayard, West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenny|first=Hamill|title=West Virginia Place Names: Their Origin and Meaning, Including the Nomenclature of the Streams and Mountains|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015009099824;view=1up;seq=126|year=1945|publisher=The Place Name Press|location=Piedmont, WV|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Unfair (or disloyal) competition''' in [[commercial law]] is a deceptive business practice that causes economic harm to other businesses or to consumers.&lt;ref name="FindLaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfair Competition|url=http://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/business-laws-and-regulations/unfair-competition-.html|website=FindLaw.com|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LII"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfair Competition|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/unfair_competition|publisher=Legal Information Institute of Cornell University Law School|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a number of areas of law involving acts by one competitor or group of competitors which harm another in the field, and which may give rise to [[Crime|criminal offenses]] and civil [[Cause of action|causes of action]]. The most common actions falling under the banner of unfair competition include:

* Matters pertaining to [[antitrust]] law, known in the [[European Union]] as [[competition law]]. Antitrust violations constituting unfair competition occur when one competitor attempts to force others out of the market (or prevent others from entering the market) through tactics such as [[predatory pricing]] or obtaining exclusive purchase rights to raw materials needed to make a competing product.
* [[Trademark infringement]] and [[passing off]], which occur when the maker of a product uses a name, logo, or other identifying characteristics to deceive consumers into thinking that they are buying the product of a competitor. In the [[United States]], this form of unfair competition is prohibited under the [[common law]] and by state statutes, and governed at the federal level by the [[Lanham Act]].
* [[Misappropriation]] of [[trade secret]]s, which occurs when one competitor uses [[espionage]], [[bribery]], or outright [[theft]] to obtain economically advantageous information in the possession of another. In the United States, this type of activity is forbidden by the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]] and the [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]].
* [[Trade libel]], the spreading of false information about the quality or characteristics of a competitor's products, is prohibited at common law.
* [[Tortious interference]], which occurs when one competitor convinces a party having a relationship with another competitor to breach a contract with, or duty to, the other competitor is also prohibited at common law.

Various [[unfair business practices]] such as [[fraud]], [[misrepresentation]], and [[Unconscionability|unconscionable]] [[contract]]s may be considered unfair competition, if they give one competitor an advantage over others. In the [[European Union]], each member state must regulate unfair business practices in accordance with the principles laid down in the [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], subject to transitional periods. (See also [[trade regulation]] law.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5746">'''Workfare''' is an alternative, and controversial, way of providing money to otherwise unemployed or underemployed people, who are applying for social benefits. The term was first introduced by [[civil rights]] leader [[James Charles Evers]] in 1968; however, it was popularized by [[Richard Nixon]] in a televised speech August 1969.&lt;ref name="peck"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peck|first=Jamie|title=Workfare: a geopolitical etymology.|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|year=1998|volume=16|pages=133–161|doi=10.1068/d160133}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early model of workfare had been pioneered in 1961 by [[Joseph Mitchell (city manager)|Joseph Mitchell]] in [[Newburgh, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leman|first=Christopher|title=The Collapse of Welfare Reform: Political Institutions, Policy, and the Poor in Canada and the United States|place=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=MIT Press|year=1980|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional welfare benefits systems are usually awarded based on certain conditions, such as searching for work, or based on meeting criteria that would position the recipient as unavailable to seek employment or be employed. Under workfare, recipients have to meet certain participation requirements to continue to receive their welfare benefits. These requirements are often a combination of activities that are intended to improve the recipient's job prospects (such as training, [[:wikt:rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], and [[work experience]]) and those designated as contributing to society (such as unpaid or low-paid work). These programs, now common in Australia (as "mutual obligation"), Canada, and the [[Workfare in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], have generated considerable debate and controversy. In the [[Netherlands]] workfare is known as Work First, based on the Wisconsin Works program from the United States.

There are two main types of workfare scheme: those that encourage direct employment to get individuals off the welfare roll and directly into the workforce, and those that are intended to increase human capital by providing training and education to those currently in the welfare system.&lt;ref name="peck" /&gt;

In less developed countries, similar schemes are designed to alleviate rural poverty among day-labourers by providing state-subsidised [[temporary work]] during those periods of the year when little agricultural work is available. For example, the [[National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA)]] in India offers 100 days' paid employment per year for those eligible, rather than unemployment benefits on the Western model. However, a workfare model typically not only focuses on provision of social protection through a wage-income transfer, but also supports workers to get into work.

== Goals ==
The purported main goal of workfare is to generate a "net contribution" to society from welfare recipients. Most commonly, it means getting unemployed people into paid work, reducing or eliminating welfare payments to them and creating an income that generates taxes. Workfare participants may retain certain employee rights throughout the process, however, often workfare programs are determined to be "outside employment relationships" and therefore the rights of beneficiaries can be different. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Dietrich| first1 = Sharon| last2 = Emsellem | first2 = M.| last3 = Paradise| first3 = J.| contribution = Employment Rights of Workfare Participants and Displaced Workers| title = National Employment Law Project Second Edition, March 2000| publisher = NELP| date =| year = 2000| contribution-url = http://www.nelp.org/docUploads/pub18%2Epdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some workfare systems also aim to derive a contribution from welfare recipients by more direct means. Such systems obligate unemployed people to undertake work that is considered beneficial to their community.

==Criticism==
[[File:Workfare.jpg|thumb|Demonstration against "workfare", October 2011.]]
Workfare schemes in the UK are controversial. In the US, critics point out that the type of work offered by workfare providers is generally unskilled and is comparable to community work carried out by criminal offenders being punished on [[community service]] schemes.&lt;ref name="Fuentes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fuentes|first1=Annette|title=Giuliani's Workfare: Slaves of New York|url=http://www.baltimorechronicle.com/workfare.html|journal="The Baltimore Chronicle"|accessdate=15 January 2018|date=6 Feb 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many charities and workers' unions have criticized workfare schemes for undermining the work done by actual charity volunteers, and acting as a threat to low paid unskilled workers.

In Australia, the [[Work for the Dole]] schemes have been linked to the concepts of “mutual obligation” and "compliance". Their effectiveness has been questioned by researchers.
