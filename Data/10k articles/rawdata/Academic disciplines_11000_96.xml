An '''after action review''' (AAR) is a structured review or de-brief ([[debriefing]]) process for analyzing ''what'' happened, ''why'' it happened, and ''how'' it can be done better by the participants and those responsible for the project or event. After-action reviews in the formal sense were originally developed by the [[U.S. Army]].  Formal AARs are used by all US military services and by many other non-US organizations. Their use has extended to business as a [[knowledge management]] tool and a way to build a culture of accountability.

An AAR occurs within a cycle of establishing the leader's intent, planning, preparation, action and review. An AAR is distinct from a de-brief in that it begins with a clear comparison of intended vs. actual results achieved. An AAR is distinct from a post-mortem in its tight focus on participant's own action; learning from the review is taken forward by the participants. Recommendations for others are not produced. AARs in larger operations can be cascaded in order to keep each level of the organization focused on its own performance within a particular event or project.

Formal AAR meetings are normally run by a facilitator, and can be chronological reviews or tightly focused on a few key issues selected by the team leader. Short cycle informal AARs are typically run by the team leader or assistant and are very quick.

==After action reviews in the military==

There are basically two types of military AARs—formal and informal. Formal AARs require more detailed planning, preparation, and resources. They are normally scheduled and conducted as a part of external and internal evaluations. Informal AARs require less planning and preparation than formal AARs and are often on-the-spot reviews of soldier and collective training performance at crew, squad, or platoon level.

===Formal===

Formal AARs are normally conducted at company level and above. However, when a training event is focused at squad or platoon level, and resources are available, a formal AAR may be conducted to gain maximum training benefit. Externally evaluated lane training, small-unit ARTEPs, and tank and BFV gunnery tables are prime examples. Informal crew, squad, and platoon AARs are held prior to company and higher-echelon AARs.

The AAR facilitator (evaluator or controller) provides a mission and task overview and leads a discussion of events and activities that focuses on the objectives. The discussion with leaders and soldiers should orient on the use of terrain integration of key BOS (&lt;ref name="FM 101-5-1 (Operational Terms and Graphics)" group="Department of the Army Publications"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosley|first=Troy|title=Operational Terms and Graphics|url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/army/docs/fm101-5-1/f545-b.htm|work=FM 101-5-1|publisher=Department of the Army|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battlefield Operating Systems), and leader actions. The discussion should also examine the weapons systems and doctrine used by the enemy during the exercise. At the close, the AAR leader summarizes comments from the observers, covering strengths and weaknesses discussed during the AAR and what the unit needs to do to fix the weaknesses.

===Informal===

Informal AARs are usually conducted for soldier and crew-, squad-, and platoon-level training or when resources are not available to conduct a formal review. They are often held for lower echelons prior to a formal company- or higher-level AAR, though they may be conducted at company level. Informal AARs are extremely important since they involve all soldiers and leaders in the participating unit. The formal company AARs for the training event depend on these thorough, informal reviews. These are sometimes referred to as a [[hotwash]].

Informal AARs are conducted similar to formal AARs and may be done for large or small units. They may be scheduled, or leaders may do on-the-spot reviews during the training. Discussion comments could be recorded to use in follow-on AARs or to apply immediately the lessons learned as the exercise is repeated.

'''Alliin''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|i|.|ɪ|n}} is a [[sulfoxide]] that is a natural constituent of fresh [[garlic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a derivative of the [[amino acid]] [[cysteine]]. When fresh garlic is chopped or crushed, the enzyme [[alliinase]] converts alliin into [[allicin]], which is responsible for the aroma of fresh garlic. 

Garlic has been used since antiquity as a therapeutic remedy for certain conditions now associated with [[oxygen toxicity]], and, when this was investigated, garlic did indeed show strong [[antioxidant]] and [[hydroxyl]] [[free radical|radical]]-scavenging properties, it is presumed owing to the alliin contained within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Alliin was the first natural product found to have both carbon- and sulfur-centered stereochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Garlic and other alliums: the lore and the science |author = Eric Block |publisher= [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |year= 2009 |pages= 100–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical synthesis ==
The first reported synthesis, by Stoll and Seebeck in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chemical investigations on alliin, the specific principle of garlic|last = Stoll , Seeback|first = Arthur, Ewald|date = 1951|journal = Advanced Enzymology |volume=11 |pages=377–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; begins the alkylation of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-cysteine with [[allyl bromide]] to form deoxyalliin. Oxidation of this sulfide with [[hydrogen peroxide]] gives both [[diastereomer]]s of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-alliin, differing in the orientation of the oxygen atom on the [[sulfur]] [[stereocenter]].
[[File:H2O2toAlliin.png|centre|frameless|420 px]]
A newer route, reported by Koch and Keusgen in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diastereoselective synthesis of alliin by an asymmetric sulfur oxidation|last = Koch, Keusgen|date = 1998|journal = Pharmazie |volume=53 |issue=668-671}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows stereospecific oxidation using conditions similar to the [[Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation]]. The chiral catalyst is produced from [[diethyl tartrate]] and [[titanium isopropoxide]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16492">'''Artstor''' is a [[non-profit organization]] that builds and distributes the Digital Library, an online resource of more than 2 million images in the arts, architecture, humanities, and sciences, and Shared Shelf, a Web-based cataloging and image management software service that allows institutions to catalog, edit, store, and share local collections.

== History ==
[[File:Artstor_logo.png|thumb|right|Artstor logo]]
Since 2003, the organization has been an independent non-profit 501(C)(3) organization based in New York. Starting in 2016, it joined in a strategic alliance with [[Ithaka Harbors]], which currently operates the services [[JSTOR]], Portico, and Ithaka S+R.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://artstor.wordpress.com/2016/01/28/artstor-and-ithaka-join-forces/|title=Artstor and ITHAKA join forces. |accessdate=2017-08-04 | work=The Artstor Blog | date=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, as universities and libraries began to convert their slide libraries into local digital image databases, Artstor was created to address the growing need for a shared online image library that would be accessible to educational institutions worldwide. The Artstor Digital Library is intended to reduce redundant efforts of scanning and cataloging thousands of the same images from multiple repositories, and also to enable new digital image collections to be shared for teaching and research. The initiative paired innovative digital image and online technologies with Mellon Foundation’s ongoing mission to support higher education, museums, the arts, and art conservation to “bring about a substantial transformation in art-related teaching, learning, and research.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/05/technology/05MELL.html|title=Departing Harvard Leader to Organize Digital Art. |accessdate=2010-12-29 | work=The New York Times | first=Karen W. | last=Arenson | date=2001-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artstor's primary goals as an organization are: to assemble image collections from across many time periods and cultures; to create an organized, central, and reliable digital resource that supports strictly non-commercial use of images for research, teaching and learning; and to work with the arts and educational communities to develop collective solutions for building, managing and sharing digital images for educational use. Like many non-profits, Artstor has a mixed business model; some services are provided on a fee basis (geared toward the size of the subscribing institution) and others are provided free of charge to the community.

== Digital Library ==
The Artstor Digital Library includes a set of software tools to view, present, and manage images for research and teaching purposes.   There are currently more than 1,500 Artstor institutional subscribers in over 40 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artstor.org/interested-in-participation/i-html/current-participants.shtml|title=Current Participating institutions|accessdate=2010-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101226020135/http://www.artstor.org/interested-in-participation/i-html/current-participants.shtml| archivedate= 26 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[college]]s and [[University|universities]], [[museum]]s, [[Library|libraries]], primary and secondary [[school]]s, and other non-profit organizations.
The Artstor Digital Library offers a wide range of images needed for interdisciplinary teaching and research, including contributions from the leading museums, photo archives, libraries, scholars, photographers, artists, and artists’ estates. These diverse collections include: [[Magnum Photos]], Carnegie Arts of the United States, [[Adam Bartsch|The Illustrated Bartsch]], the Mellon International [[Dunhuang]] Archive, The Huntington Archive of Asian Art, and The [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) Architecture and Design Collection, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Bodleian Library]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artstor.org/what-is-artstor/w-html/collection-status.shtml|title=ARTstor Collection descriptions &amp; status |accessdate=2010-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101226003016/http://www.artstor.org/what-is-artstor/w-html/collection-status.shtml| archivedate= 26 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Digital Library comprises more than one million images from hundreds of collections worldwide.

'''Tools and features'''

Artstor users have the ability to search, organize, present, upload, and share images.  In addition to keyword and advanced searching, users may browse works by geography, classification, or collection name.  Users can zoom in on high-resolution images in the image viewer and review related information in image data records. They can also export images for use in classroom presentations and other non-commercial, educational uses, either as [[JPEG]]s, or presentations for [[PowerPoint]] 2007. Artstor has also developed the Offline Image Viewer (OIV), an alternative tool for giving offline classroom presentations. OIV allows users to download much larger images from Artstor, combine Artstor images with their own content to create digital slide show presentations that feature side-by-side comparisons, zooming and panning, and the ability to customize text on the slides. OIV enables instructors to give reliable classroom presentations using both high-resolution Artstor images and local content without being connected to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artstor.org/using-artstor/u-html/remote-access.shtml|title=Access Artstor-anywhere, anytime|accessdate=2010-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101226013819/http://www.artstor.org/using-artstor/u-html/remote-access.shtml| archivedate= 26 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Artstor Digital Library is accessible through Apple iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, and Android-powered devices, providing read-only features such as searching and browsing, zooming, and viewing saved image groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://help.artstor.org/wiki/index.php/ARTstor_Mobile|title=ARTstor Mobile-Artstor Help|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BIOS.jpg|thumb|alt=R/V Atlantic Explorer at the BIOS dock.|R/V ''Atlantic Explorer'' at the dock.]]

The '''Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences''' (known as '''BIOS''') is an independent, non-profit marine science and education institute located in [[Ferry Reach]], [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]], [[Bermuda]]. The Institute, founded in 1903 as the Bermuda Biological Station, hosts a full-time faculty of [[oceanographer]]s, [[biologist]]s, and [[environmental scientist]]s, graduate and undergraduate students, K-12 groups, and [[Road Scholar]] (formerly [[Elderhostel]]) groups. BIOS's strategic mid-[[Atlantic Ocean]] location has at its doorstep a diverse marine environment, with close proximity to [[Deep sea|deep ocean]] as well as [[coral reef]] and near shore habitats.

Prior to 5 September 2006, BIOS was known as the '''Bermuda Biological Station for Research''' (BBSR).

==History==
Founded in 1903 and incorporated in New York as a US not-for-profit institution in 1926, in its initial years BIOS was a seasonal field station for visiting zoologists and biologists to take advantage of Bermuda's diverse marine environment. After the Second World War, BIOS became a year-round research center, anchored by the establishment in 1954 of Hydrostation 'S': regular deep ocean observations of a single point in the ocean that continue today, creating the longest continuous oceanic database in the world. During the following few decades, increasing numbers of visiting scientists brought an increased emphasis on biological and geological studies.

Resident scientific programs strengthened in the 1980s as the institute became a key link in an international effort to describe and understand the ocean-atmosphere system. In 1998, BIOS established the International Center for Ocean and Human Health, considered the first of its kind to explore the ocean health/human health connection on a global scale. The Center for Integrated [[Ocean Observations]] was established in 1999 and uses new technologies to build on a century of marine research at the institute.

'''Other notable dates:''' 1978: Oceanic Flux Program begins, the longest record of deep ocean sediment-trap studies in the world. 1988: [[Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study]] (BATS) begins, establishing BIOS as one of two US centers for [[time-series]] studies on temporal variability in the ocean and providing key data on changing climate and the ocean. 1994: Risk Prediction Initiative, a collaboration between climate scientists and reinsurers, is established.

==Notable visitors==
Summers from 1928 to 1939, oceanographic explorer [[William Beebe]] worked in [[Bermuda]].  During those years, Beebe visited BIOS (then the Bermuda Biological Station for Research) and worked with BIOS staff.  While Beebe is best remembered for his [[Bathysphere]] dives at Nonsuch Island, he made a number of other significant scientific contributions during his stay, mainly the discovery of new species of marine life.

==Research programs==
BIOS has a range of research programs investigating the role of the ocean in global climate, the health of coral reefs, and the connection between healthy oceans and healthy people. The geographical range is not restricted to the waters around Bermuda, but also extends to the [[Arctic]], the [[Antarctic]] and the [[tropics]]. '''The Center for Integrated Ocean Observations''' program is an international collaboration of oceanographers and climate scientists. Taking advantage of Bermuda's unique position, their goal is to better understand the biological, chemical and physical processes that take place in the ocean and the ocean's role in regulating the Earth's climate. '''The International Center for Ocean and Human Health''' is designed to address both health of the ocean (such as pollution threats) and health from the ocean (including nutrients and pharmaceutical applications). Working with experts on [[ocean acidification]], [[coral reefs]], [[ecotoxicology]], [[algae fuel|algal biofuel]], and the [[carbon cycle]]. '''The Risk Prediction Initiative (RPI)'''  program brings climate scientists and insurers together to collaborate to identify new directions for climate research. Matching the Institute's unique research ability with Bermuda's [[reinsurance|insurance]] market, this business-science partnership provides rapid, current and comprehensive information to those parts of the business community affected by environmental change.

==Research vessel==
[[File:CTD JCaison.jpg|thumb|alt=Preparing the CTD for deployment.|Preparing the CTD for deployment from the R/V ''Atlantic Explorer'']]The '''[[RV Atlantic Explorer|R/V Atlantic Explorer]]''' is a [[research vessel]] owned and operated by the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences and is supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] and BIOS.  It operates in compliance with [[United States Coast Guard]], [[University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System]] (UNOLS) and [[American Bureau of Shipping]] (ABS) rules and regulations.

The 168&amp;nbsp;ft Atlantic Explorer is equipped with navigation, laboratory and mechanical systems and equipment to support biological, geological, chemical and physical oceanographic research. Deploying and recovering deep ocean instrumentation [[Mooring (oceanography)|moorings]], conducting [[Conductivity, temperature, depth|CTD casts]], chemical sampling, and gear testing are among the number of operations within the ship's capabilities.

Ready access of two hours or more from Bermuda to the deep ocean makes the Atlantic Explorer useful for both short and extended cruises, for repetitive sampling and time-series research, and for projects requiring analytical and other sophisticated shore facilities.

The '''Canadian Association for Irish Studies''' (L'association canadienne d'études irlandaises)  or CAIS was founded in 1973. Its objective is to promote the study of Irish culture in [[Canada]], and its particular aim is to attract young scholars to the field. It uses conferences, publications and online resources to promote discussion of current ideas relating to Irish studies and culture.

CAIS has members throughout Canada. Others can be found in [[Ireland]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[United States]], Europe, Asia and Australasia.

Among the Association's activities are an annual conference at a university in Canada. These conferences are attended by students, scholars and members of the public.

The Association also publishes the semi-annual ''Canadian Journal of Irish Studies'' and a newsletter.

[[Image:Capandshare02outline.jpg|thumb|300px|A diagram which sets out the basic process of the policy]]

'''Cap and Share''' was originally developed by [[Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability|Feasta]] (the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability) and is a regulatory and economic framework for controlling the use of fossil fuels in relation to climate stabilisation. Accepting that climate change is a global problem and that there is a need to cap and reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions globally, the philosophy of Cap and Share maintains that the earth’s atmosphere is a fundamental common resource. Consequently, it is argued, each individual should get an equal share of the benefits from the limited amount of fossil fuels that will have to be burned and their emissions released into the atmosphere in the period until the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases has been stabilised at a safe level.

== Design ==

This market based mechanism was devised by [[Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability|Feasta]] in 2005 and 2006, and they have set out the case for the introduction of Cap and Share globally in policy documents.&lt;ref name=Feasta1&gt;The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability, 2008. [http://www.feasta.org/documents/energy/Cap-and-Share-May08.pdf Cap and Share: A Fair Way to Cut Greenhouse Gas Emissions]. Feasta, Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt; It calls for global emissions to be capped at their current level and then brought down year by year at a rate fast enough to prevent catastrophic climate change. Each year, the emissions tonnage involved would be shared equally amongst the Earth's adult population, each of whom would receive a certificate representing their individual entitlement. The recipients would then sell their certificates through the banking system to oil, coal and gas producers who would need to acquire enough of them to cover the carbon dioxide emissions that would be emitted from all of the fossil fuel they sold. Everyone would receive at least partial compensation for the higher cost of fossil fuels that limiting their availability would necessarily involve.

Comhar, the National Sustainable Development Council of Ireland, commissioned a report on the mechanism which incorporates policy&lt;ref name=AEAReport&gt;AEA Energy and Environment, 2008. [http://www.feasta.org/documents/energy/AEA_cap_and_share.pdf Cap and Share: Phase 1; Policy Options for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions.] Report to Comhar Sustainable Development Council. AEA, Didcot.&lt;/ref&gt; and economic analysis of using Cap and Share to control emissions in Ireland, particularly from the transport sector. The final report&lt;ref name=AEAReport2&gt;AEA Energy and Environment and Cambridge Econometrics, 2008. [http://www.feasta.org/documents/energy/Comhar_Cap_and_Share_Report.pdf A Study in Personal Carbon Allocation: Cap and Share]. Comhar Sustainable Development Council, Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in December 2008.

Cap and Share is partly an extension and popularisation of the [[Contraction and Convergence]] proposal developed by the Global Commons Institute, which also calls for an equal per capita distribution of emissions. Cap and Share differs in that it insists that emissions allocations should be distributed equally to individuals as their right, whereas Contraction and Convergence (C&amp;C) allows governments to decide if this is the way they wish to share out what is, essentially, their national allocation. C&amp;C also allows for (but does not insist on) a convergence period, during which the richer countries would receive higher per capita emissions allowances than poorer countries. Cap and Share says people in rich countries should get the same emissions entitlement as those in poor countries from the start, but suggests that in the early years of the system, a portion of everyone's emissions entitlement should be held back and distributed to governments of countries which were facing exceptional difficulties in adapting to climate change or to low levels of fossil energy use. The governments involved would sell their certificates to raise money for remedial works. For example, the government of Bangladesh might sell its allocation to pay for better defences against rising sea levels.

== Principles ==

# That a ceiling or cap on carbon dioxide and other green house gas (ghg) emissions from fossil fuels should be calculated that prevents an average global temperature rise of over 2 degrees Celsius.
# That the right to emit such ghgs is a human right, and should be shared on an equal-per-capita basis, with permits going to each individual rather than to their governments.
# That the permits would be saleable through the post office and banking system to the importers and producers of fossil fuels who would need to acquire enough permits to cover the emissions from the fuels they introduce.
# That any national or European Union scheme should be designed as a possible prototype for a global system that will also help set the conditions for the alleviation of poverty and the maintenance of biodiversity.

== Economic assessment ==

If the future were known with certainty, then the economic implications of Cap and Share would equal the economic implications of a carbon tax with lump sum recycling—that is, the carbon tax revenue would be used to send every household a cheque in the post. Some argue that lump sum recycling is an inferior way to recycle the revenue of environmental taxes,&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence H. Goulder (1995), Effects of Carbon Taxes in an Economy with Prior Tax Distortions: An Intertemporal General Equilibrium Analysis, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 29, 271-297.&lt;/ref&gt; and that this has been repeatedly confirmed for Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Adele Bergin et al. (2004), [http://www.epa.ie/downloads/pubs/research/econ/epa_reducing_greenhouse_gas.pdf   The macroeconomic effects of using fiscal instruments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions], Environmental Protection Agency, Johnstown Castle.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Conefrey et al. (2008), [http://ideas.repec.org/p/esr/wpaper/wp251.html The impact of a carbon tax on economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland], Working Paper 251, [[Economic and Social Research Institute]], Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale is that with the carbon tax revenue coming into government coffers, it could be directly spent by the government rather than distributed to the population via cheques, and that other kinds of taxation, such as labour taxation, could be decreased correspondingly. It is argued that this would have a positive effect on GDP since there would be a greater incentive for firms to increase employment, and that it would also positively affect social equity, since labour taxes are regressive by nature.

The NGO that developed Cap and Share, Feasta, argues that while it is definitely a good idea to shift the tax burden away from labour and towards capital, a carbon tax is not the optimal instrument for this purpose. Carbon taxes do not establish a predictable level of emissions cuts, unlike a cap, and can be vulnerable to short-term political pressures such as an increase in the price of oil, since a country's tax policy is usually adjusted each year in the annual Budget.   Feasta suggests that if a carbon tax were to be introduced, it would work best in tandem with Cap and Share. The two policies could be used to help countries fine-tune their responses to climate change and [[Peak Oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feasta.org/documents/papers/IIEA_Occasional_Paper_4.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217174252/http://www.feasta.org/documents/papers/IIEA_Occasional_Paper_4.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feasta also advocates the introduction of a [[land value tax|land-value-based tax]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.feasta.org/documents/landhousing/coritax.html&lt;/ref&gt; which they believe could be used as a substitute for taxation on labour and could therefore have a similar effect on the market to a carbon tax.

As the future is not known with certainty, some argue that cap and share has all the drawbacks of quantity-based regulation for a stock pollutant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Weitzman]] (1974), Prices vs Quantities, [[Review of Economic Studies]], 41 (4), 477-491.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of greenhouse gas emissions, the argument goes, price-based regulation (incl. a carbon tax with lump-sum recycling) is more robust to uncertainty and leads to lower welfare losses.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Pizer (1999), The optimal choice of climate change policy in the presence of uncertainty, Resource and Energy Economics, 21, 255-287.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, however, Cap and Share advocates argue that the problem of assuring that specific emissions targets are reached is not properly addressed by using a purely price-based mechanism for emissions reduction. From their perspective, a definite, substantial decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, carried out in an equitable way so that the poor are not adversely affected, is well worth a possible decrease in "welfare" as measured by GDP (a highly problematic instrument for measuring wellbeing&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUaJMNtW6GA&lt;/ref&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3687">The '''Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence''' (CSTPV) is a research centre at the School of International Relations at the [[University of St. Andrews]], and is Europe's oldest [[terrorism]] research facility. The CSTPV is dedicated to the study of the causes, dynamics, characteristics and consequences of terrorism and related forms of political violence while committed to rigorous, evidence-based, scholarly analysis that is policy-relevant but independent.&lt;ref name="handa"&gt;{{cite web| title =About the Centre|  url =http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~cstpv/about.html|publisher=The Handa Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence|accessdate=2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the CSTPV investigates the responses of states, civil society, and international organizations to violent modes of waging conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Herbert-Burns, Sam Bateman and Peter Lehr (eds.), Lloyd's MIU Handbook of Maritime Security, (Fl: Auerbach Publications, 2008) p.xix&lt;/ref&gt; As the basis of its work, the CSTPV maintains databases, manifestations, and consequences of terrorism and other forms of political violence.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd's MIU Handbook of Maritime Security, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

CSTPV has been able to expand its research and teaching work as the result of a donation from the [[Worldwide Support for Development]] (WSD), chaired by Japanese religious leader [[Haruhisa Handa]]. Hence it was also named as Handa Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence.&lt;ref name="handa"/&gt;

==History==
The Centre was founded in 1994 by [[Paul Wilkinson (academic)|Paul Wilkinson]] and [[Bruce Hoffman]]&lt;ref name="cstpv"&gt;{{cite web| title =CSTPV Hoffman News|  url =http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~cstpv/news/index_files/bruce-hoffman.php|publisher=The Handa Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence|accessdate=2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and created the [[RAND Corporation|Rand]]-St. Andrews terrorism incident database which provides data for their studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hsinchun Chen, Edna Reid, Joshua Sinai, Andrew Silke, Boaz Ganor (eds.), Terrorism Informatics: Knowledge Management and Data Mining for Homeland Security, (New York: Springer, 2008) p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 whilst head of Politics and International Relations at [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen University]], Wilkinson had established The Terrorism Research Unit in the department, which developed a terrorism database in coordination with [[RAND Corporation|RAND]]. At that time RAND's terrorism database was overseen by [[Brian Michael Jenkins|Brian Jenkins]] who in 1989 was replaced by Bruce Hoffman. Hoffman left RAND to set up CSTPV some time in 1994.

In 1998 Bruce Hoffman returned to RAND and Paul Wilkinson took over as Director, amalgamating the role with his position as Chairman. When Wilkinson stepped down [[Magnus Ranstorp]] was appointed Acting Director and then briefly Director from early to mid 2005.

In May 2006 [[Alex P. Schmid|Alex Schmid]] took over as Director.  That autumn CSTPV moved into new premises, occupying now the whole second floor of the West-wing of the New Arts Building.

==Academic programmes==
CSTPV offer a full-time [[Postgraduate Diploma]]/[[M.Litt]] in Terrorism Studies along with two long distance [[E-learning|E-learning courses]]. CSTPV currently runs two E-Learning courses, an online Certificate in Terrorism course, with their commercial partners [[Informa]], and a part-time E-Learning PG Dip/M.Litt in Terrorism Studies. The development of these courses is overseen by the Terrorism Studies Programme Board.

'''Collaborative leadership''' is a management practice which is focused on leadership skills across functional and organizational boundaries.

==Term Exploration==
The phrase collaborative leadership first appeared in the mid-1990s in response to the twin trends of growth in [[strategic alliance]]s between private corporations, and the formation of long-term [[public private partnership]] contracts to rebuild [[public infrastructure]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Kurt Lewin was first to apply cooperative system in scientific method in 1947 about individual nutrition in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Abdolhamid, A. (2016). School principals’ collaborative leadership style and relation it to teachers’ self-efficacy. International Journal of Research Studies in Education, Vol 5, Iss 3, Pp 3-12 (2016), (3), 3. doi:10.5861/ijrse.2015.1218.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1994 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article "Collaborative Advantage", [[Rosabeth Moss Kanter]] addressed leaders who recognize that critical business relationships exist "that cannot be controlled by formal systems but require (a) dense web of interpersonal connections".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rosabeth Moss Kanter on the Frontiers of Management|first=Rosabeth Moss |last=Kanter|journal=Harvard Business Review|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|year=2003|isbn=1-59139-323-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their book published that same year, Chrislip and Larson looked at the attributes of great civic leaders in communities across the US and found some similar attributes. "Collaboration needs a different kind of leadership; it needs leaders who can safeguard the process, facilitate interaction and patiently deal with high levels of frustration"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Collaborative Leadership Fieldbook - A guide for citizens and civic leaders|first=David|last=Chrislip|publisher=Josey Bass|year=2002|isbn=0-7879-5719-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2013, ''Harvard Business Review''&lt;ref name=HBR&gt;{{cite web | url=https://hbr.org/2013/02/why-the-world-needs-tri-sector.html | title=Why the World Needs Tri-Sector Leaders | work=Harvard Business Review | date=February 13, 2013 | accessdate=July 22, 2016 | author=Nick Lovegrove|author2=Matthew Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; authors [[Nick Lovegrove]] and Matthew Thomas (co-founders of The InterSector Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intersector.com/ The InterSector Project]&lt;/ref&gt;), explore the complex relationship between the business, government and social sectors as it relates to said sectors role in addressing society's most pressing challenges; issues such as managing resource constraints, controlling health care costs, training the twenty-first-century workforce, developing and implementing smart-grid and intelligent-urbanization technologies, and stabilizing financial systems to foster sustainable economic growth.  Their research suggests that the future of collaborative leadership depends on the ability of leaders to engage and collaborate with the business, government and social sectors (see below for the distinguishing characteristics of such leaders).&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;

Hank Rubin author and founder of the Institute for Collaborative Leadership has written "A collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to accomplish a shared outcome." In his book ''Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools,'' Rubin asks "Who is a collaborative leader?" and answers "You are a collaborative leader once you have accepted responsibility for building - or helping to ensure the success of - a heterogeneous team to accomplish a shared purpose . Your tools are (1) the purposeful exercise of your behavior, communication, and organizational resources in order to affect the perspective, beliefs, and behaviors of another person (generally a collaborative partner) to influence that person's relationship with you and your collaborative enterprise and (2) the structure and climate of an environment that supports the collaborative relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools|last1=Rubin|first1=Hank|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-6544-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin and Brock distinguish collaborative leadership from collective impact, defining the latter as "...(beginning) when we, as a community, agree to a set of shared outcomes and then, individually, return to our home organizations and work with our staffs, boards, and volunteers to figure out what we - individually and organizationally - can best do to achieve those shared goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/opinion/guest-column/2017/03/01/rochester-monroe-anti-poverty-effort-more-than-collaboration/98603876/|title=Rochester-Monroe anti-poverty effort more than collaboration|last=Brock {{!}} Rubin|first=Leonard {{!}} Hank|date=March 5, 2017|work=Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative leadership is how we align and integrate across organizations.

David Archer and Alex Cameron, in their 2008 book ''Collaborative Leadership: How to succeed in an interconnected world'', identify the basic objective of the collaborative leader as the delivery of results across boundaries between different organisations. They say "Getting value from difference is at the heart of the collaborative leader's task... they have to learn to share control, and to trust a partner to deliver, even though that partner may operate very differently from themselves."&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative leadership – how to succeed in and interconnected world|first1=David|last1=Archer|first2=Alex|last2=Cameron|publisher=Butterworth Heinemann|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7506-8705-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Providing further exploration, in his 2015 book ''Enabling Collaboration – Achieving Success Through Strategic Alliances and Partnerships'' {{ISBN|9780986079337}}, Martin Echavarria argues that Collaborative Leadership is  the result of individual collaborative leadership capability, as well as group leadership. In this respect, he argues that individuals can support and contribute to collaboration and do so from a leadership point of view; but at the group level, where collaboration can be behaviorally experienced. Echavarria cites the work of [[Enrique Pichon-Rivière]], who developed the Operative Group method for working with groups, [[Wilfred Bion]] an influential British psychoanalyst, [[Kurt Lewin]] and others and describes the Operative Partnership Methodology for coaching teams to collaborate (an issue which is addressed vis-a-vis strategic alliances in said publication.&lt;ref&gt;Echavarria, Martin, (2015).

==Characteristics of collaborative leaders==
There have been a number of research projects and reviews of key lessons learned for collaborative leaders.

Nick Lovegrove and Matthew Thomas, writing for the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'',&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt; interviewed over 100 leaders who possess a demonstrated ability to engage and collaborate across the business, government and social sectors.  The authors identified six major, distinguishing characteristics:&lt;ref name=HBR/&gt;

# Balanced motivations. A desire to create public value no matter where they work, combining their motivations to wield influence (often in government), have social impact (often in nonprofits) and generate wealth (often in business)
# Transferable skills. A set of distinctive skills valued across sectors, such as quantitative analytics, strategic planning and stakeholder management
# Contextual intelligence. A deep empathy of the differences within and between sectors, especially those of language, culture and key performance indicators
# Integrated networks. A set of relationships across sectors to draw on when advancing their careers, building top teams, or convening decision-makers on a particular issue
# Prepared mind. A willingness to pursue an unconventional career that zigzags across sectors, and the financial readiness to take potential pay cuts from time to time
# Intellectual thread. Holistic subject matter expertise on a particular intersector issue by understanding it from the perspective of each sector

[[Madeline Carter]], writing for the [[Center for Effective Public Policy]] as part of a research project funded by the [[United States Department of Justice]] and [[State Justice Institute]], defines five qualities of a collaborative leader:&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Madeline M. (2006). ''[http://www.collaborativejustice.org/docs/The%20Importance%20of%20Collaborative%20Leadership.pdf The Importance of Collaborative Leadership in Achieving Effective Criminal Justice Outcomes]''. Center for Effective Public Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Willingness to take risks
# Eager listeners
# Passion for the cause
# Optimistic about the future
# Able to share knowledge, power and credit

Archer and Cameron list ten key lessons for successful collaborative leaders:&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;

*Find the ''personal'' motive for collaborating
*Find ways of simplifying complex situations for your people
*Prepare for how you are going to handle conflict well in advance
*Recognize that there are some people or organisations you just can't partner with
*Have the courage to act for the long term
*Actively manage the tension between focusing on delivery and on building relationships
*Invest in strong personal relationships at all levels
*Inject energy, passion and drive into your leadership style
*Have the confidence to share the credit generously
*Continually develop your interpersonal skills, in particular: empathy, patience, tenacity, holding difficult conversations, and coalition building.

Rod Newing writing in a ''[[Financial Times]]'' supplement special report says "If a collaboration is to be effective, each party must recognise and respect the different culture of the other". And traditional development paths don't prepare leaders well for this "traditional management development, is based on giving potential managers a team of people and a set of resources to control – and success is rewarded with more people and more resources to control. By contrast, collaboration requires managers to achieve success through people and resources outside their control and for this they have had no preparation".{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Steven Wilson mentions in “Collaborative leadership: it’s good to talk,” four major key leadership traits that all highly collaborative leaders share:
* Focus on authentic leadership; placing the goals of the organization ahead of their own self-interest and following through on their commitments
* Relentlessly pursue transparent decision making clear how their decisions are made and who is accountable for the outcomes
* View resources as instruments of action; realizing shared goals through the flexible use of shared resources
* Clarify the relationship between decisions, rights, accountability and rewards; taking time to establish decision paths and a common vocabulary that everyone can comprehend for successful collaborations
Chantale Mailhot, Stephanie Gagnon, Anne Langley and Louis-Felix Binitte did a research project to examine the qualities of distributing leadership and the effects diversity has on groups. They found that "coupling of leaders and objects helped to maintain the worldview of the different groups involved at different levels in the research project, while directing them towards project objectives".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In retrospect, the differences of each individual increases innovation due to the variety of minds at work. With everyone having their own qualities and prior experiences, the integration between them in a leadership role contributes to the overall experience. In this study, the case was made that collaborative leadership has many benefits and is more practical than just one person solely having the role as the leader.

The best thing a collaborative leader can do is to lead by example. They have to ‘walk the talk’, and be seen to model the right behaviors. Leaders must show a willingness take risks, continually question their own ideas, and reward others for their clear communication and valuable insights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=50202a11-e515-462e-b046-643cdfe41aa7@sessionmgr103&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=114|title=Collaborative leadership: it's good to talk.: ".Start Your Research"|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The need for collaborative leadership is being recognised in more and more areas;
#[[Public Private Partnership]]s
#Global [[Supply Chain]]s
#Civic collaboration to solve complex community problems
#On-line collaboration – [[Linux]], [[Wikipedia]] etc.
#Political collaboration to tackle global issues such as the [[Financial crisis of 2007-2008|credit crunch]], [[Global warming|climate change]] and terrorism
#The Government-  According to Heather Getha-Taylor and Ricardo S. Morse as part of their article, collaborative leadership has an impact on the roles of local government officials. It is said that public administration is shifting to a more collaborative leadership oriented field, because it helps with the set of skills necessary for the jobs.&lt;ref&gt;GETHA-TAYLOR, H., &amp; MORSE, R. S. (2013). COLLABORATIVE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS: EXPLORING COMPETENCIES AND PROGRAM IMPACT. Public Administration Quarterly, (1). 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Education- According to Abdolhamid Arbabi and Vali Mehdinezhad collaborative leadership adds to cooperation which allows for adaptability and consistency. It “increases organizational commitment and decreases employee resistance to changes.” There is a significant correlation between the teachers self-efficiency and the principles style of collaborative leadership. According to Gialamas, Pelonis, and Medeiros collaborative leadership allows for leaders to work together. It allows for a better adaptability to change which in turn allows for “growth and development.”&lt;ref&gt;Arbabi, A., &amp; Mehdinezhad, V. (2015). The relationship between the school principals' collaborative leadership style and teachers' self-efficacy. ''Palestrica Of The Third Millennium Civilization &amp; Sport'', ''16''(2), 125-131.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Health Services- According to Markle-Reid, Dykeman, Ploeg, Stradiotto, Andrews, Bonomo, &amp; Stradiotto, collaborative leadership in the Health area will allow for a more widespread set of skills required to help the patients. An example brought up is the idea that the elderly do not receive the help they require because of the fact that the people do not know how to react in the given case. They know what to do, but when confronted by the situation they do not know how to act. Collaborative leadership will allow for the skills necessary as well as a uniform set of actions they must follow.&lt;ref&gt;Markle-Reid, M., Dykeman, C., Ploeg, J., Stradiotto, C. K., Andrews, A., Bonomo, S., &amp; ... Kelly Stradiotto, C. (2017).

''BMC Health Services Research'', ''17''1-12. doi:10.1186/s12913-017-2089-3&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[Ipsos MORI]] research report published in 2007 found that relationship management and collaborative leadership were the top two qualities or capabilities that Directors of organisations involved in large business partnerships would have liked to have had more access to when setting up or running a partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socia.co.uk/knowledge/Research.aspx|title=Business Partnerships Survey|year=2007|publisher=Ipsos MORI|accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Linguistics}}
In [[linguistics]], '''construction grammar''' groups a number of models of [[grammar]] that all subscribe to the idea that knowledge of a language is based on a collection of "form and function pairings". The "function" side covers what is commonly understood as ''meaning'', ''content'', or ''intent''; it usually extends over both conventional fields of [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]].

Language users learn these pairings as individual, whole facts about language. These language facts are indexed to specific interactive contexts and/or linguistic practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Kerstin|date=December 2015|title=Conversation, Construction Grammar, and cognition|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-and-cognition/article/conversation-construction-grammar-and-cognition/F60C5CDB2335B915DD69D2C6E7A1C903|journal=Language and Cognition|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=563–588|doi=10.1017/langcog.2015.23|issn=1866-9808}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be associated in the mind of the language user with a highly particularized [[sociolect]], [[dialect]], pattern of [[jargon]], [[genre]],&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis, Laura A. and Hanbing Feng. 2015.

The guiding insight of '''construction grammar''' (often abbreviated '''CxG''') is that rules of syntactic combination are directly associated with interpretive and use conditions. All construction-based grammars allow units bigger than the word as semantic building blocks of syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/pdf/BoasSag-intro.pdf|title=Introducing Sign Based Construction Grammar|last=Boas, Hans|first=Ivan Sag and Paul Kay|date=2012|website=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the bipartite clausal pattern sometimes referred to as the Correlative Conditional construction, as found in the proverbial expression ''The bigger they come, the harder they fall'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sag|first=Ivan|date=2010|title=English Filler-Gap Constructions|url=|journal=Language|volume=86|pages=486-545|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fillmore|first=Charles|date=1986|title=Varieties of Conditional Sentences|url=|journal=Eastern States Conference on Linguistics|volume=3|pages=163-182|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michaelis|first=Laura A.|date=1994-01-01|title=A Case of Constructional Polysemy in Latin|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/sl.18.1.04mic|journal=Studies in Language|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=45–70|doi=10.1075/sl.18.1.04mic|issn=0378-4177}}&lt;/ref&gt;; another is the Copula Doubling construction exemplified by ''The thing is, is you never really know'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/38263988/BrenierMichaelis.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1521475150&amp;Signature=TWAXUdE0zZ2GItL76IwBVILCcA8%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DOptimization_via_Syntactic_Amalgam_Synta.pdf|title=Optimization via syntactic amalgam: Syntax-prosody mismatch and copula doubling|last=Brenier, Jason|first=Laura Michaelis|date=2005|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In contrast to traditional compositional approaches to syntax, in which all conceptual content comes from the lexicon, and rules of syntactic combination do no more than determine which word sequences function as units for syntactic purposes, constructional approaches assume a continuum of idiomaticity (or generality) of expressions, from tightly bound idioms to fully productive patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, Paul and Laura A. Michaelis. 2012. Constructional Meaning and Compositionality. In C. Maienborn, K. von Heusinger and P. Portner (eds.), Semantics: An International Handbook of Natural Language Meaning. Vol. 3. Berlin: de Gruyter. 2271-2296&lt;/ref&gt; This fundamental commitment unites all of the varieties of CxG, whether or not formal descriptive methods are used and whether the research program targets language development, second-language learning, typology, diachrony, language productions and comprehension, language evolution, conversational practice or social identity. Owing to its focus on descriptive precision, patterns of usage, grammaticalization and the structure of linguistic categories, CxG is closely linked to the explanatory frameworks of [[cognitive-functional linguistics]].

== History ==
Historically, the notion of construction grammar developed out of the ideas of "global rules" and "transderivational rules"{{example needed}} in [[generative semantics]], together with the generative semantic idea of a grammar as a constraint satisfaction system.
[[George Lakoff]]'s "Syntactic Amalgams" paper in 1974 (Chicago Linguistics Society, 1974) posed a challenge for the idea of transformational derivation.

Construction grammar was spurred on by the development of Cognitive Semantics, beginning in 1975 and extending through the 1980s. Lakoff's 1977 paper, Linguistic Gestalts (Chicago Linguistic Society, 1977) was an early version of CxG, arguing that the meaning of the whole was not a compositional function of the meaning of the parts put together locally. Instead, he suggested, constructions themselves must have meanings.

Construction grammar was developed in the 1980s by linguists such as [[Charles J. Fillmore|Charles Fillmore]], [[Paul Kay]], and George Lakoff. Construction grammar was developed in order to handle cases that intrinsically went beyond the capacity of [[generative grammar]].

The earliest study was "There-Constructions," which appeared as Case Study 3 in George Lakoff's ''[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lakoff, George| title=Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal about the Mind| location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press| year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It argued that the meaning of the whole was not a function of the meanings of the parts, that odd grammatical properties of [[Deictic]] There-constructions followed from the pragmatic meaning of the construction, and that variations on the central construction could be seen as simple extensions using form-meaning pairs of the central construction.

Fillmore et al.'s (1988) paper on the English ''let alone'' construction was a second classic. These two papers propelled cognitive linguists into the study of CxG.

== Grammatical construction ==
In construction grammar, like in general [[semiotics]], the [[grammatical construction]] is a pairing of form and content. The formal aspect of a construction is typically described as a [[syntax|syntactic]] template, but the form covers more than just syntax, as it also involves [[phonology|phonological]] aspects, such as [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. The content covers [[semantics|semantic]] as well as [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] meaning.

The semantic meaning of a grammatical construction is made up of conceptual structures postulated in [[cognitive semantics]]: [[Image schema|image-schema]]s, frames, conceptual metaphors, conceptual metonymies, prototypes of various kinds, mental spaces, and bindings across these (called "blends"). Pragmatics just becomes the cognitive semantics of communication—the modern version of the old [[John R. Ross|Ross]]-Lakoff performative hypothesis from the 1960s.

The form and content are [[symbolic relation|symbolically linked]] in the sense advocated by [[Ronald Langacker|Langacker]].

Thus a construction is treated like a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] in which all structural aspects are integrated parts and not distributed over different modules as they are in the [[componential model]]. Consequentially, not only constructions that are lexically fixed, like many idioms, but also more abstract ones like [[argument structure]] schemata, are pairings of form and conventionalized meaning. For instance, the [[ditransitive]] schema [S V IO DO] is said to express semantic content X CAUSES Y TO RECEIVE Z, just like ''kill'' means X CAUSES Y TO DIE.

In construction grammar, a grammatical construction, regardless of its formal or semantic complexity and make up, is a pairing of form and meaning. Thus words and word classes may be regarded as instances of constructions. Indeed, construction grammarians argue that all pairings of form and meaning are constructions, including phrase structures, [[idiom]]s, [[word]]s and even [[morpheme]]s.

== Syntax-lexicon continuum ==
Unlike the componential model, construction grammar denies any strict distinction between the two and proposes a ''syntax-lexicon continuum''. The argument goes that words and complex constructions are both pairs of form and meaning and differ only in internal symbolic complexity. Instead of being discrete modules and thus subject to very different processes they form the extremes of a continuum (from regular to idiosyncratic): syntax &gt; [[Subcategorization|subcategorization frame]] &gt; idiom &gt; [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] &gt;  [[syntactic category]] &gt; word/[[lexicon]] (these are the traditional terms; construction grammars use a different terminology).

== Grammar as an inventory of constructions ==
In construction grammar, the grammar of a language is made up of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] networks of families of constructions, which are based on the same principles as those of the conceptual categories known from [[cognitive linguistics]], such as inheritance, prototypicality, extensions, and multiple parenting.

Four different models are proposed in relation to how information is stored in the taxonomies:

#'''Full-entry model'''
#:In the full-entry model information is stored redundantly at all relevant levels in the taxonomy, which means that it operates, if at all, with minimal generalization.{{example needed}}
#:
#'''Usage-based model'''
#:The [[usage-based model]] is based on [[Inductive reasoning|inductive learning]], meaning that linguistic knowledge is acquired in a bottom-up manner through use. It allows for redundancy and generalizations, because the language user generalizes over recurring experiences of use.{{example needed}}
#:
#'''Default inheritance model'''
#:According to the default inheritance model, each network has a default central form-meaning pairing from which all instances inherit their features. It thus operates with a fairly high level of generalization, but does also allow for some redundancy in that it recognizes extensions of different types.{{example needed}}
#:
#'''Complete inheritance model'''
#:In the complete inheritance model, information is stored only once at the most superordinate level of the network. Instances at all other levels inherit features from the superordinate item. The complete inheritance does not allow for redundancy in the networks.{{example needed}}

===Shift towards usage-based model===
All four models are advocated by different construction grammarians, but since the late 1990s there has been a shift towards a general preference for the usage-based model.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The shift towards the usage-based approach in construction grammar has inspired the development of several [[corpus linguistics|corpus]]-based methodologies of constructional analysis (for example, [[collostructional analysis]]).

== Synonymy and monotony ==
As construction grammar is based on schemas and taxonomies, it does not operate with dynamic rules of derivation. Rather, it is [[monotonic models of grammar|monotonic]].

Because construction grammar does not operate with surface derivations from underlying structures, it adheres to functionalist linguist [[Dwight Bolinger]]'s ''principle of no synonymy'', on which [[Adele Goldberg (linguist)|Adele Goldberg]] elaborates in her book.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book | author=Goldberg, Adele| title=Constructions: A construction grammar approach to argument structure| location=Chicago/London | publisher=University of Chicago Press| year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that construction grammarians argue, for instance, that active and passive versions of the same proposition are not derived from an underlying structure, but are instances of two different constructions. As constructions are pairings of form and meaning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396683.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195396683-e-1|title=Construction Grammar|last=Hoffmann|first=Thomas|last2=Trousdale|first2=Graeme|date=2013-04-18|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195396683.013.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;, active and passive versions of the same proposition are not synonymous, but display differences in content: in this case the pragmatic content.

== Some construction grammars ==
As mentioned above, Construction grammar is a "family" of theories rather than one unified theory. There are a number of formalized Construction grammar frameworks. Some of these are:

===Berkeley Construction Grammar===
Berkeley Construction Grammar (BCG: formerly also simply called Construction Grammar in upper case) focuses on the formal aspects of constructions and makes use of a unification-based framework for description of syntax, not unlike [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]]. Its proponents/developers include Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, [[Laura Michaelis]], and to a certain extent [[Ivan Sag]]. Immanent within BCG works like Fillmore and Kay 1995&lt;ref&gt; Fillmore, Charles J. and Paul Kay. 1995. A Construction Grammar Coursebook. Unpublished ms, University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt; and Michaelis and Ruppenhofer 2001&lt;ref&gt; Michaelis, L. A., &amp; Ruppenhofer, J. 2001. Beyond alternations: A constructional account of the applicative pattern in German. Stanford: CSLI Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; is the notion that phrasal representations—embedding relations—should not be used to represent combinatoric properties of lexemes or lexeme classes. For example, BCG abandons the traditional practice of using non-branching domination (NP over N' over N) to describe undetermined nominals that function as NPs, instead introducing a determination construction that requires ('asks for') a non-maximal nominal sister and a lexical 'maximality' feature for which plural and mass nouns are unmarked. BCG also offers a unification-based representation of 'argument structure' patterns as abstract verbal lexeme entries ('linking constructions'). These linking constructions include transitive, oblique goal and passive constructions. These constructions describe classes of verbs that combine with phrasal constructions like the VP construction but contain no phrasal information in themselves.

===Sign Based Construction Grammar===

In the mid-2000s, several of the developers of BCG, including Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, Ivan Sag and Laura Michaelis, collaborated in an effort to improve the formal rigor of BCG and clarify its representational conventions. The result was Sign Based Construction Grammar (SBCG). SBCG&lt;ref&gt;Boas, H.C. and Sag, I.A. eds., 2012. Sign-based construction grammar (pp. xvi+-391). CSLI Publications/Center for the Study of Language and Information.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis, L.A., 2009. Sign-based construction grammar. The Oxford handbook of linguistic analysis, pp.155-176.&lt;/ref&gt; is based on a multiple-inheritance hierarchy of typed feature structures. The most important type of feature structure in SBCG is the sign, with subtypes word, lexeme and phrase. The inclusion of phrase within the canon of signs marks a major departure from traditional syntactic thinking. In SBCG, phrasal signs are licensed by correspondence to the mother of some licit construct of the grammar. A construct is a local tree with signs at its nodes. Combinatorial constructions define classes of constructs. Lexical class constructions describe combinatoric and other properties common to a group of lexemes. Combinatorial constructions include both inflectional and derivational constructions. SBCG is both formal and generative; while cognitive-functional grammarians have often opposed their standards and practices to those of formal, generative grammarians, there is in fact no incompatibility between a formal, generative approach and a rich, broad-coverage, functionally based grammar. It simply happens that many formal, generative theories are descriptively inadequate grammars. SBCG is generative in a way that prevailing syntax-centered theories are not: its mechanisms are intended to represent all of the patterns of a given language, including idiomatic ones; there is no 'core' grammar in SBCG. SBCG a licensing-based theory, as opposed to one that freely generates syntactic combinations and uses general principles to bar illicit ones: a word, lexeme or phrase is well formed if and only if it is described by a lexeme or construction. Recent SBCG works have expanded on the lexicalist model of idiomatically combining expressions sketched out in Sag 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Sag, Ivan A. (2012) Sign-Based Construction Grammar: An informal synopsis, in H. C. Boas and I. A. Sag, (eds), Sign-Based Construction Grammar. Stanford: CSLI Publications). 69-202&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goldbergian/Lakovian construction grammar===
The type of construction grammar associated with linguists like Goldberg and Lakoff looks mainly at the external relations of [[grammatical construction|constructions]] and the structure of constructional networks. In terms of form and function, this type of construction grammar puts psychological plausibility as its highest desideratum. It emphasizes experimental results and parallels with general cognitive psychology. It also draws on certain principles of cognitive linguistics. In the Goldbergian strand, constructions interact with each other in a network via four inheritance relations: [[polysemy]] link, subpart link, metaphorical extension, and finally instance link.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Cognitive grammar===
Sometimes, Ronald Langacker's [[cognitive grammar]] framework is described as a type of construction grammar. Cognitive grammar deals mainly with the semantic content of constructions, and its central argument is that conceptual semantics is primary to the degree that form mirrors, or is motivated by, content. Langacker argues that even abstract grammatical units like [[part-of-speech]] classes are semantically motivated and involve certain conceptualizations.

===Radical construction grammar===
[[William A. Croft]]'s [[radical construction grammar]] is designed for [[linguistic typology|typological]] purposes and takes into account cross-linguistic factors. It deals mainly with the internal structure of constructions. Radical construction grammar is totally non-[[reductionism|reductionist]], and Croft argues that constructions are not derived from their parts, but that the parts are derived from the constructions they appear in. Thus, in radical construction grammar, constructions are likened to [[wikt:gestalt|Gestalt]]s. Radical construction grammar rejects the idea that syntactic categories, roles, and relations are universal and argues that they are not only language-specific, but also construction specific. Thus, there are no universals that make reference to formal categories, since formal categories are language- and construction-specific. The only universals are to be found in the patterns concerning the mapping of meaning onto form. Radical construction grammar rejects the notion of syntactic relations altogether and replaces them with semantic relations. Like Goldbergian/Lakovian construction grammar and cognitive grammar, radical construction grammar is closely related to cognitive linguistics, and like cognitive grammar, radical construction grammar appears to be based on the idea that form is semantically motivated.

===Embodied construction grammar===
Embodied construction grammar (ECG), which is being developed by the [http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/NTL/ Neural Theory of Language (NTL)] group at ICSI, UC Berkeley, and the University of Hawai{{okina}}i, particularly including Benjamin Bergen and Nancy Chang, adopts the basic constructionist definition of a grammatical construction, but emphasizes the relation of constructional semantic content to [[Embodied cognition|embodiment]] and [[sensorimotor rhythm|sensorimotor]] experiences. A central claim is that the content of all linguistic signs involves [[mental simulation]]s and is ultimately dependent on basic [[image schema]]s of the kind advocated by [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] and George Lakoff, and so ECG aligns itself with cognitive linguistics. Like construction grammar, embodied construction grammar makes use of a [[unification-based]] model of representation. A non-technical introduction to the NTL theory behind embodied construction grammar as well as the theory itself and a variety of applications can be found in Jerome Feldman's ''From Molecule to Metaphor: A Neural Theory of Language'' (MIT Press, 2006).

===Fluid construction grammar===
[[Fluid construction grammar]] (FCG) was designed by [[Luc Steels]] and his collaborators for doing experiments on [http://www.fcg-net.org the origins and evolution of language].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Steels, Luc| title=Design Patterns in Fluid Construction Grammar| location=Amsterdam | publisher=John Benjamins| year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Steels, Luc| title=Computational Issues in Fluid Construction Grammar| location=Heidelberg | publisher=Springer| year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FCG is a fully operational and computationally implemented formalism for construction grammars and proposes a uniform mechanism for parsing and production. Moreover, it has been demonstrated through robotic experiments that FCG grammars can be grounded in embodiment and sensorimotor experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Steels, Luc |editor2=Hild, Manfred | title=Language Grounding in Robots| location=New York | publisher=Springer| year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FCG integrates many notions from contemporary [[computational linguistics]] such as [[feature structure]]s and unification-based language processing. Constructions are considered bidirectional and hence usable both for parsing and production. Processing is flexible in the sense that it can even cope with partially ungrammatical or incomplete sentences. FCG is called 'fluid' because it acknowledges the premise that language users constantly change and update their grammars. The research on FCG is conducted at [http://csl.sony.fr Sony CSL Paris] and the AI Lab at the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]].

===Others===
In addition there are several construction grammarians who operate within the general framework of construction grammar without affiliating themselves with any specific construction grammar program. There is a growing interest in the [[Synchrony and diachrony|diachronic]] aspect of grammatical constructions and thus in the importation of methods and ideas from [[grammaticalization]] studies. Another area of growing interest is the [[pragmatics]] of [[pragmatic constructions]]. This is probably one of the reasons why the usage-based model is gaining popularity among construction grammarians. Another area of increasing interest among construction grammarians is that of [[language acquisition]] which is mainly due to [[Michael Tomasello]]'s work. [[Mats Andrén]] coined the term [[multimodal constructions]] to account for constructions that incorporate both (conventionalized) gesture and speech.

The [[harpsichord]] was largely obsolete, and seldom played, during a period lasting from the late 18th century to the early 20th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ukpianos.co.uk/harpsichord-history.html | title=Harpsichord History | accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument was successfully revived during the 20th century, first in an [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]] form strongly influenced by the piano, then with historically more faithful instruments. The revival was the joint work of performers, builders, and composers who wrote new harpsichord pieces. However the harpsichord never completely disappeared from the public eye as it was used through the mid-19th century for basso continuendo because despite its low volume, it had considerable power to "cut through" the orchestra. The earliest revival efforts began in the mid-19th century due to its increasingly infrequent usage and there was concern that the instrument could become a forgotten relic of the past.

==Instruments==
[[File:Clavecin 1979.JPG|thumb|300px|A heavy-framed mid-century harpsichord by the Sperrhake firm. Such instruments were harshly criticized during the 1960s by [[Wolfgang Zuckermann|Zuckermann]], who described their sound as feeble and their appearance as tubby, a betrayal of the tradition of beauty seen in historical instruments.]]
[[File:Deless-10.jpg|thumb|300px|Harpsichords played today tend to follow closely the building practices established in the historical period. This modern instrument was built by Jean-Paul Rouaud based on a historical instrument made in 1707 by Nicolas Dumont.]]
In the earlier stages, 20th-century harpsichords were heavily influenced by the technology of the modern piano, and usually included metal framing (which was entirely absent in historical instruments). It was felt that such construction would increase the stability of tuning. Since heavy framing tends to stifle harpsichord sound, instruments were bolstered by other means, notably the addition of a [[Eight foot pitch|16']] stop (an additional set of strings that played an octave below normal pitch); such stops were somewhat unusual in the historical period but became widespread in the first half of the 20th century. An example was the harpsichord produced by [[Pleyel et Cie]] at the request of Landowska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.harpsichord.org.uk/EH/Vol2/No5/pleyel.pdf | title=The Pleyel Harpsichord | last=Richard | first=J.A. | publisher=The British Harpsichord Society | year=1979 | accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the mid-20th century, instruments were introduced whose construction followed historical principles, with thinner cases, historical dispositions (arrangements of choirs of strings) and no metal framing. Among the leaders of this shift were [[Frank Hubbard]], [[William Dowd]], and [[Martin Skowroneck]]. With time, such instruments came to dominate the scene, and the older heavy-frame instruments are almost never manufactured today. They retain historical value, however, since they were the instruments that early to mid-20th-century composers had in mind when they wrote their works.&lt;ref&gt;Thus the [[Neupert]] firm still offers its mid-century "Bach" model for sale, defending it explicitly on the grounds of its suitability for 20th-century music ([http://www.jc-neupert.de/en/node/48]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition of harpsichord building toward historicist principles is covered in detail by Hubbard (1965), Zuckermann (1969), and Kottick (2003), cited below.

==Music written for the contemporary harpsichord==

===Classical music===
In the 20th century, classical composers returned to the harpsichord as they sought out variation in the sounds available to them. Under the influence of [[Arnold Dolmetsch]], the [[harpsichordist]]s [[Violet Gordon-Woodhouse]] (1872–1951) and in France, [[Wanda Landowska]] (1879–1959), were at the forefront of the instrument's renaissance.

[[Harpsichord concerto|Concertos]] for the instrument were written by [[Francis Poulenc]] (the ''[[Concert champêtre]]'', 1927–28), [[Manuel de Falla]], [[Walter Leigh]], [[Bertold Hummel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bertoldhummel.de/english/register/register.html Bertold Hummel list of works]: Op. 15 is his ''Divertimento capriccioso'' for harpsichord and chamber orchestra.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henryk Mikołaj Górecki]], [[Michael Nyman]], [[Philip Glass]] and [[Viktor Kalabis]]. [[Bohuslav Martinů]] wrote both a [[concerto]] and a [[sonata (music)|sonata]] for the instrument, and [[Elliott Carter]]'s ''Double Concerto'' is scored for harpsichord, piano and two chamber [[orchestra]]s. The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] composer [[Frank Martin (composer)|Frank Martin]] also wrote a harpsichord concerto for chamber ensemble (1951), and the instrument featured in one of his most famous works, ''[[Petite Symphonie Concertante]]''. 

In chamber music, [[György Ligeti]] wrote a small number of solo works for the instrument (including ''[[Continuum (Ligeti)|Continuum]]''), and [[Henri Dutilleux]]'s ''Les Citations'' (1991) is scored for harpsichord, oboe, double bass and percussions. [[Elliott Carter]]'s ''Sonata for Flute, Oboe, Cello and Harpsichord'' (1952) and his ''Double Concerto For Piano, Harpsichord, and Two Chamber Orchestras'' (1961) explore the timbre possibilities of the modern harpsichord.

[[Iannis Xenakis]] is also one of the composers who have written for harpsichord, with works like ''A l'lle de Gorée'' for amplified harpsichord and chamber orchestra, ''Komboi'' and ''Oophaa'' for harpsichord (again amplified) and percussion, and the two solo works ''Khoai'' and ''Naama''.

[[Josef Tal]] wrote ''Concerto for harpsichord &amp; electronic music'' (1964), ''Three Compositions for recorder &amp; harpsichord'' (1966) and ''Chamber Music'' (1982) for s-recorder, marimba &amp; harpsichord. Both [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] (''Hamlet'', 1964) and [[Alfred Schnittke]] (''Symphony No.8'', 1994) wrote works that use the harpsichord as part of the orchestral texture. [[John Cage]] and [[Lejaren Hiller]] wrote ''[[HPSCHD]]'' (1969) for 1-7 harpsichords and 1-51 computer-generated tapes. [[John Zorn]] has also used harpsichord in works like ''Rituals'' (1998), ''Contes de Fées'' (1999), and ''La Machine de l'Etre'' (2000).

In the Preface to his piano collection ''[[Mikrokosmos (Bartók)|Mikrokosmos]]'', [[Béla Bartók]] suggests some ten pieces as being suitable for the harpsichord.

American composer [[Vincent Persichetti]] composed a number of sonatas for the harpsichord. 

[[Benjamin Britten]] included harpsichord parts in his opera ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and his [[cantata]] ''[[Phaedra (cantata)|Phaedra]]''.

Harpsichordist [[Hendrik Bouman]] has composed pieces in the 17th- and 18th-century style, including works for solo harpsichord, harpsichord concerti, and other works that call for harpsichord continuo. Other contemporary composers writing new harpsichord music in period styles include [[Grant Colburn]], and [[Fernando De Luca]]. Notable performers include [[Oscar Milani]] and [[Mario Raskin]].

Works for harpsichord in the 21st century include Northern Irish composer Alan Mills's ''Two Cubist Inventions'' (2000 / 2013)&lt;ref&gt;Two Cubist Inventions (no date) Available at: http://www.musichaven.co.uk/Two-Cubist-Inventions.html (Accessed: 13 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and French composer Karol Beffa's ''Suite'' (2008), ''Sarabande et Doubles'' (2015) and 'Destroy'' (2007) for harpsichord and string quartet.

===Folk music===
[[Seán Ó Riada]] used the harpsichord both for the soundtracks of film music, and for interpretations of the Irish harper [[Turlough O'Carolan]] during Riada's work with the band [[Ceoltori Cualann]] (later to become [[The Chieftains]]). Riada used harpsichord for the latter with the justification that the harpsichord best replicated the sound of the metal strings of the early [[Irish harp]].&lt;ref name="CooperDawe2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Cooper|author2=Kevin Dawe|title=The Mediterranean in Music: Critical Perspectives, Common Concerns, Cultural Differences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di1KQc6-HCwC&amp;pg=PA220|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5407-9|pages=220–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Love2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy Mason Love|title=The Film Music of Sean O Riada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zq2J4F7cAXIC&amp;pg=PA66|year=2009|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-1-109-20305-9|pages=66–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular music===
The revival of the harpsichord spilled over into [[popular music]]. Its first appearance in [[jazz music]] happened around 1940, when pianist [[Johnny Guarnieri]] was asked to play a harpsichord in [[Artie Shaw]]'s [[quintet]] "[[Gramercy Five]]".&lt;ref name="berindei"&gt;Berindei, Mihai (1976). ''Jazz Dictionary'', Scientific and Encyclopedic Publishing House, Bucharest, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The band recorded eight albums between 1940 and 1945, which were reissued in 1990 (''The Complete Gramercy Sessions'').

In the 1960s and 1970s, the harpsichord was used by groups including [[The Beatles]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[The Kinks]], [[The Monkees]], [[The Partridge Family]], [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]], and [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]]. A great number of other artists since then have used harpsichord in their work such as [[Jens Johansson]] from [[Stratovarius]].

The harpsichord also appeared in film and on television.  For example, it appeared on the television show ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', played by [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]]. It appeared in the 1960s [[Miss Marple]] films featuring [[Margaret Rutherford]] and the cult show ''[[The Prisoner]]''.

[[Boys for Pele]], the third album of American singer-songwriter [[Tori Amos]], is notable for featuring the harpsichord as the main instrument on several songs, including the lead single [[Caught a Lite Sneeze|Caught A Lite Sneeze]].

The '''coronary arteries''' are the [[arteries]] of the [[coronary circulation]], which transports [[blood]] into and out of the [[cardiac muscle]]. They are mainly composed of the left and right coronary arteries, both of which give off branches. Coronary arteries can also be categorized as Epicardial (above the [[epicardium]]) and Microvascular (close to the [[endocardium]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 4336803|year = 2014|last1 = Petersen|first1 = J. W.|title = Microvascular Coronary Dysfunction and Ischemic Heart Disease – Where Are We in 2014?|journal = Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine|volume = 25|issue = 2|pages = 98–103|last2 = Pepine|first2 = C. J.|pmid = 25454903|doi = 10.1016/j.tcm.2014.09.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[left coronary artery]] arises from the [[aorta]] above the left cusp of the [[aortic valve]] and feeds blood to the left side of the [[heart]]. It branches into two arteries and sometimes a third branch is formed at the fork, known as a ''ramus'' or ''intermediate artery''.&lt;ref name="Hurst"&gt;{{cite book | last=Fuster | first=V |author2=Alexander RW |author3=O'Rourke RA  | title=Hurst's The Heart | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2001 | page=53 | edition=10th | isbn=978-0-07-135694-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[right coronary artery]] originates from above the right cusp of the aortic valve. It travels down the right [[coronary sulcus]], towards the [[Crux cordis|crux of the heart]].

There is also the '''conus artery''', which is only present in about 45 per cent of the human population, and which may provide collateral blood flow to the heart when the [[left anterior descending artery]] is occluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Functional significance of the conus artery as a collateral to an occluded left anterior descending artery demonstrated by stress echocardiography |journal=International Journal of Cardiology |volume= 140|issue= 1|pages= e14–5|year=2008 |pmid=19108914 |doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2008.11.039| vauthors=Wynn GJ, Noronha B, Burgess MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The conus artery: a third coronary artery |journal=American Heart Journal |year=1949 |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=823–38 |pmid=15395916| vauthors=Schlesinger MJ, Zoll PM, Wessler S |doi= 10.1016/0002-8703(49)90884-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==
{{Main|Coronary artery disease}}
Either or both [[arteriosclerosis]] and [[atherosclerosis]], can cause one or more of the coronary arteries or their branches to become seriously blocked, leading to [[angina]], [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], or both. [[Percutaneous coronary intervention]]s (such as balloon angioplasty) or [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] can be performed to decrease or bypass the blockages (respectively).

The coronary arteries can constrict as a response to various stimuli, mostly chemical. This is known as a [[coronary reflex]].

There is also a rare condition known as [[spontaneous coronary artery dissection]].

The word ''corona'' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] word meaning "crown", from the [[Ancient Greek]] κορώνη (korōnè, “garland, wreath”). It was applied to the coronary arteries because of a notional resemblance (compare the photos).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5418">A '''deliberatorium''' or '''collaboratorium''' is a form of online collaborative [[argument mapping]]. It was first deployed as the [[MIT]] Collaboratorium, and directed at the question of [[climate change]]. 

==History==

In December 2008,  Center for Collective Intelligence at the [[MIT]] Mark Klein tested a prototype of the collaboratorium at the [[University of Naples]] featuring a 200 student debate on biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bringing order to online discussions about climate change |url=http://blogs.nature.com/boston/2008/04/10/bringing-order-to-online-discussions-about-climate-change |website=Nature.com |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Features==

Deleiberatoriums work by deploying a website which allows the public to post the latest scientific results about climate change. Once done, people can debate how to get rid of carbon emissions which is how politicians get feedback on public opinion.  

The site operates similar to [[Wikipedia]] for authoritative reports but with a more structured, organized debate featuring an argument tree. These reports for the site come from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

'''Denison University''' is a [[Private university#United States|private]], coeducational, and residential four-year [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts]] college in [[Granville, Ohio|Granville]], [[Ohio]], about {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Founded in 1831, it is Ohio's second-oldest liberal arts college. Denison is a member of the [[Five Colleges of Ohio]] and the [[Great Lakes Colleges Association]], and competes in the [[North Coast Athletic Conference]]. The acceptance rate for the class of 2022 was 34 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://denison.edu/news-events/featured/103450|title=Denison Admission Most Selective in College History|publisher=Denison University|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On December 13, 1831, John Pratt, the college's first president and a graduate of [[Brown University]], inaugurated classes at the '''Granville Literary and Theological Institution.'''&lt;ref name=p9&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heritage and Promise: Denison 1831-1981 |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1981 |page=9 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated on a 200-acre farm south of the village of Granville; it was the second [[Baptist]] college west of the Allegheny mountains after [[Georgetown College (Kentucky)|Georgetown College]], which was founded in 1829.&lt;ref name=p9/&gt; While rooted in theological education, the institution offered students the same literary and scientific instruction common to other colleges of the day.&lt;ref name=p9/&gt; The first term included 37 students, 27 of whom hailed from Granville; nearly half of these students were under fifteen years of age. The school was more of an academy than a college.&lt;ref name=p14&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heritage and Promise: Denison 1831-1981 |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1981 |page=14 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school's first Commencement, which graduated three classical scholars, was held in 1840.&lt;ref name=p14/&gt;

In 1845, the institution, which at this point was male-only, officially changed its name to '''Granville College.'''&lt;ref name=p14/&gt; In 1853, [[William S. Denison]], a Muskingum County farmer, pledged $10,000 toward the college's endowment. Honoring an earlier commitment, the trustees accordingly changed the name of the institution to '''Denison University.''' They also voted to move the college to land then available for purchase in the village of Granville.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heritage and Promise: Denison 1831-1981 |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1981 |pages=21–22 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Swasey Chapel (1924), Denison University.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Swasey Chapel (1924)]]
In the years leading up to the Civil War, many students and faculty members at Denison University became deeply involved in the anti-slavery movement. Professor [[Asa Drury]], the chair of Greek and Latin studies, became the leader of a local anti-slavery society. Bancroft House, now a residential hall, served as a stop on the Underground Railroad for refugee slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chessman |first=G. Wallace |title=Denison: The Story of an Ohio College |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1957 |pages=84–85 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denison.edu/library/collections/bancroft_house.html |title=Bancroft House |work=Denison University |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927045421/http://www.denison.edu/library/collections/bancroft_house.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of coeducation at Denison University began in December 1832 with the establishment of the Granville Female Seminary, founded by Charles Sawyer a year before [[Oberlin College]] launched the first coeducational college in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shepardson |first=Francis W. |title=Denison University, 1831-1931: A Centennial History |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1931 |page=32 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heritage and Promise: Denison 1831-1981 |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1981 |page=12 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seminary was superseded by the Young Ladies' Institute, founded in 1859 by Dr. and Mrs. Nathan S. Burton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shepardson |first=Francis W. |title=Denison University, 1831-1931: A Centennial History |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1931 |pages=180–181 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Young Ladies' Institute was sold to Reverend Dr. Daniel Shepardson in 1868 and was renamed the Shepardson College for Women in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shepardson |first=Francis W. |title=Denison University, 1831-1931: A Centennial History |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1931 |pages=186, 193 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shepardson College was incorporated as part of Denison University in 1900, with the two colleges becoming fully consolidated in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chessman |first=G. Wallace |title=Denison: The Story of an Ohio College |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1957 |page=227 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heritage and Promise: Denison 1831-1981 |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1981 |page=114 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, Denison inaugurated a master's program, with resident graduates pursuing advanced studies in the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heritage and Promise: Denison 1831-1981 |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1981 |page=49 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few years, the institution considered offering graduate programs on the doctoral level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heritage and Promise: Denison 1831-1981 |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1981 |pages=71–72 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, the Board of Trustees formalized a new curriculum that would make Denison University an exclusively undergraduate institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Shepardson |first=Francis W. |title=Denison University, 1831-1931: A Centennial History |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1931 |pages=348–351 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of Shepardson College's incorporation, Denison University made plans for enlargement of its campus. In 1916, the college sought the expertise of the [[Olmsted Brothers|Frederick Law Olmsted &amp; Sons]] architectural firm. The resulting "Olmsted Plan" laid a foundation for expansion that has remained the guiding aesthetic for subsequent growth, establishing and maintaining a pedestrian-friendly campus, while also preserving scenic views of the surrounding hills and valleys. Expansion during this period included the acquisition of land to the north and east, the relocation of Shepardson College to the east ridge of College Hill, and the development of a new men's quadrangle beyond the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heritage and Promise: Denison 1831-1981 |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1981 |page=62 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Denison was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name="denison-v-12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.denison.edu/issues/2011_summer-hope/?pg=dpt-alumni-society/2|title=Left.

While the college's origins were rooted in theological education, Denison University has been a non-sectarian institution since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heritage and Promise: Denison 1831-1981 |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1981 |pages=176–177 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005, the college reached its present size of approximately 2,250 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.denison.edu/about/history.html |title= Bancroft House |work= History &amp; Traditions |accessdate= October 8, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100814204200/http://www.denison.edu/about/history.html |archivedate= August 14, 2010 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

[[File:Slayter Hall Student Union (1962), Denison University, Granville, Ohio.jpg|thumb|300px|Slayter Hall Student Union (1962)]]
The campus size is about 1,100 acres (4&amp;nbsp;km²). This includes a 400-acre (1.4&amp;nbsp;km²) biological reserve just east of campus, where professors of sciences like [[geology]] and [[biology]] can hold class. Purchased in 2014 is the Denison Golf Course, an 18-hole course just 0.4 miles from the academic campus, and the Granville Inn and Bar, now owned by the university.

The first building in the "Greater Denison" plan, Swasey Chapel was built at the center of the campus. The chapel seats 990 and plays host to notable campus events such as baccalaureate services, lectures, concerts, and academic award convocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.denison.edu/campus/swasey_chapel.html |title= Denison University: Swasey Chapel |work= Denison University |accessdate= December 29, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110401231115/http://www.denison.edu/campus/swasey_chapel.html |archivedate= April 1, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 18 academic buildings on campus. Knapp Hall, built in 1968, houses humanities and social sciences majors such as Black Studies, Sociology/Anthropology, Educational Studies, Women and Gender Studies, Religion, Political Science, and Philosophy. Ebaugh Laboratories is dedicated to chemistry. Fellows Hall houses the foreign language departments, as well as history and international studies. Also in this building is the Center for Off-Campus Study. 50% of Denison students study abroad during their junior year. Samson Talbot Hall is home to the biology department. Higley Hall, which was once called the Doane Life Sciences Building, is home to Denison's two most popular majors: Economics and Communication. Olin Science Hall contains the astronomy, computer science, geosciences, physics, and mathematics majors. Barney-Davis Hall, one of the oldest academic buildings on campus, holds classes for English majors, Environmental Studies majors, and also has the Denison Writing Center (free tutoring on any academic paper).

Doane Administration Building (the oldest building on campus) and Burton Morgan are also on academic quad (spill-over academic building, but they serve administrative purposes. The Bryant Arts Center opened in August 2009. Originally constructed in 1904 as a men's gymnasium (Cleveland Hall), it was later adapted as a student union. It was adapted and developed as the home of the studio/visual art and art history departments. The {{convert|45000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility has studios for ceramics, painting, printmaking, sculpture, photography and digital media. It also features fully electronic classrooms, open gallery spaces, an art history resource room, outdoor performance spaces, a common area for studio art seniors, and independent studios for faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.denison.edu/campus/bryant_arts.html |title= Denison University: Bryant Arts Center |work= Denison University |accessdate= December 29, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110401231010/http://www.denison.edu/campus/bryant_arts.html |archivedate= April 1, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on the fine arts quad is Doane Dance Building, Ace Morgan Theatre &amp; Arts Building, Burton Music, Cinema MIX Lab, and Burke Performance and Recital Hall. In 2017, construction began on the new Michael D. Eisner Center for the Performing Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://denison.edu/news-events/featured/87685 |title= Denison announces new performing arts center |work= Denison University |accessdate= June 29, 2018 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180611125408/https://denison.edu/news-events/featured/87685 |archivedate= June 11, 2018 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Built in 1937, Doane Library today houses more than 500,000 books and bound periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.denison.edu/campus/william_howard_doane_library.html |title= Denison University: William Howard Doane Library |work= Denison University |accessdate= December 29, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110401231007/http://www.denison.edu/campus/william_howard_doane_library.html |archivedate= April 1, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was envisioned to help foster a sense of community among campus groups. The goal behind this plan was to be both aesthetically pleasing and functional for the university on top of a hill. The landscape design was planned to strategically preserve the natural topography, but also allow for logical and symmetrical arrangements of buildings within each quad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Campus Master Plan|url=http://hcap.artstor.org/cgi-bin/library?a=d&amp;d=p528|publisher=Council of Independent Colleges|accessdate=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Location ===
Denison is located in [[Granville, Ohio]], a New England-style village settled in 1805 by a colony of settlers from [[Granville, Massachusetts]]. Denison is 25 minutes from [[Columbus, Ohio]], the 14th largest city in the United states and home to many business, art, and educational institutions. Columbus has been repeatedly recognized as a top city for millennials, business--including startups and tech, and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://columbusregion.com/market-research/rankings-and-accolades/|title=Columbus Region {{!}} Rankings &amp; Accolades|work=Columbus 2020|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, was recognized as one of the "Best Places to Live" by [[Money (magazine)|Money Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/money/collection/best-places-to-live-2017/|title=The Best Places to Live in America Right Now|website=Money|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2016-17 school year, 2,150 students are enrolled at Denison, with a gender distribution of 43 percent male students and 57 percent female students.&lt;ref name="fast facts"/&gt; They come from 50 states, [[Washington, DC]], and 40 countries, with 78% from out-of-state.&lt;ref name="fast facts"/&gt;  A full-time faculty of 235 professors makes the student-to-faculty ratio 9:1.&lt;ref name="fast facts"/&gt;

Over the past several years, Denison University has increasingly attracted a diverse student population. For instance, 19 percent of the class of 2021 are first-generation college students and 33 percent are multicultural students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://denison.edu/campus/about/fast-facts|title=Fast Facts|last=University|first=Denison|website=Denison University|language=en|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fast facts"/&gt;  While Denison has been recognized for its diversity in the past,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.denison.edu/offices/publicaffairs/featuredstories/ohio_mlk_award_20080117.html |title= State of Ohio honors Denison in Martin Luther King Jr. ceremony |publisher= Denison University |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527121157/http://www.denison.edu/offices/publicaffairs/featuredstories/ohio_mlk_award_20080117.html| archivedate=May 27, 2010|deadurl= yes| accessdate= October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was cited by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2014 as one of America's "Most Economically Diverse Top Colleges."&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leonhardt|first1=David|title=Top Colleges That Enroll Rich, Middle Class, and Poor| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/upshot/top-colleges-that-enroll-rich-middle-class-and-poor.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=1|accessdate=January 23, 2015|publisher=''New York Times''|date=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that list, Denison is ranked at No. 11 in the list of the nation’s top colleges and universities.

With a June 2016 endowment of $750 million, the endowment per student is $348,837.&lt;ref name="fast facts"/&gt; Some of this money goes towards financial aid. While the annual cost of attending is $63,130 per year, Denison awards nearly $60 million in need-based financial aid or merit-based academic scholarships.&lt;ref name="fast facts"/&gt; Furthermore, Denison University announced in September 2016 that they will partner with nonprofit I Know I Can to offer 20 full-tuition scholarships to high school students attending [[Columbus, Ohio]] city schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/09/12/denison-to-offer-total-tuition-scholarships-to-20-seniors-in-columbus-schools-each-year.html|title=Denison to offer full-tuition scholarships to 20 Columbus schools grads each year|newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' piece, president Adam Weinberg argued that the study of [[big data]] may not be unique for post-secondary education, but the marriage of liberal arts and data analytics is a unique concept. "In short," he writes. "a liberal arts background gives data analytics its soul."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-weinberg/data-analytics-and-the-li_b_9721312.html|title=Data Analytics and the Liberal Arts {{!}} Huffington Post|last=Weinberg|first=Adam|last2=|first2=|date=2016-04-19|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interdisciplinary major combines courses in mathematics and computer science, electives from the social and natural sciences and four new courses in data analytics.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newarkadvocate.com/story/news/local/granville/2016/03/23/denison-starting-data-analytics-major/82078762/|title=Denison starting data analytics major|newspaper=The Newark Advocate|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These courses allow students to acquire a foundation, learn the technique, apply the technique across disciplines, and pull it all together.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to Weinberg, this foundation will help students frame questions appropriately, work in interdisciplinary teams, communicate results effectively, and make ethical decisions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As reported by The Newark Advocate, graduates from this major may work in fields like marketing, product development, public health and other vocations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The global commerce major is the result of an 18-month research process, which included interviews with many employers and graduates.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-weinberg/beyond-business-global-co_b_8977910.html|title=Beyond Business: Global Commerce and the Liberal Arts {{!}} Huffington Post|last=Weinberg|first=Adam|last2=|first2=|date=2016-01-14|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another article in [[The Huffington Post]], Weinberg describes the process — "Over and over again, we heard a desire ... for a new kind of academic program that would give students an understanding of how economics, accounting and commerce work, blended with a wide range of liberal arts courses that prepare students to think, read cultures, understand historical patterns, problem-solve and communicate clearly. And the value of multiple internships, externships and opportunities to study abroad was stressed." The global commerce major was created to meet these requirements. The course of study has five main components: the commerce core to develop a sound understanding of economics; a specific global focus or geographic region of study; language proficiency related to their area of interest; off-campus study related to the major; and a senior capstone.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The goal of this major is to produce graduates ready and capable to enter the global workforce&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; with analytical skills and an understanding of how economy and trade are connected to culture, social movements and other global factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newarkadvocate.com/story/news/local/granville/2015/12/16/denison-offering-new-global-commerce-major/77357598/|title=Denison offering new global commerce major|newspaper=The Newark Advocate|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Class of 2022, Denison received over 8000 applications and accepted 34%.

The University Programming Council (UPC) is the main programming body on campus. A fully student operated organization, UPC annually brings in concerts, comedians, hypnotists, lectures and other forms of entertainment to campus. UPC also hosts a number of off-campus trips each year to the Columbus area and beyond. In addition to these events, UPC is well known for its annual events that have become a part of the Denison tradition: Aestavalia (spring festival), Slayter Arcade, and University Gala (Homecoming).

Denison Community Association (DCA) is a volunteer service organization, led by students and entirely student operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://denison.edu/campus/get-involved/dca|title=DCA|last=University|first=Denison|website=Denison University|language=en|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; DCA is the umbrella organization for 24 committees that recruit and train Denison students to volunteer at local community sites.

===Fraternity/sorority life===
Denison has ten active fraternities and eleven sororities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://denison.edu/campus/get-involved/fraternities-sororities|title=Fraternities &amp; Sororities|last=University|first=Denison|website=Denison University|language=en|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 24% of undergraduate men are involved in fraternities and about 30% of women are members in a sorority, although student publications have argued that this number is actually significantly higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denison University|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/denison-university-3042|work=US News Rankings and Reviews|publisher=US News|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oltvai|first=Kristof|title=Bid Day by the numbers|newspaper=The Denisonian|date=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, over 70% of the student body belonged to a fraternity or sorority organization.  Fraternities and sororities at Denison are overseen by four ruling bodies: the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|Interfraternity Council]] or IFC for fraternities, the [[National Panhellenic Conference]] for sororities, the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] for traditionally African American fraternities and sororities, and the Multicultural Greek Council for traditionally multicultural fraternities and sororities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek Life Home|url=http://www.denison.edu/campuslife/studentactivities/greek/mission.html|work=Greek Life Home|publisher=Denison University|accessdate=November 19, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106011435/https://www.denison.edu/campuslife/studentactivities/greek/mission.html|archivedate=November 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The active IFC fraternities are [[Beta Theta Pi]], [[Delta Chi]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Phi Kappa Psi]], and [[Sigma Chi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|https://denison.edu/campus/get-involved/interfraternity-council &lt;/ref&gt;  The Panhellenic Conference sororities are [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Delta Gamma]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], and [[Pi Beta Phi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panhellenic Previous sororities to exist under "Panhell" include Alpha Chi Omega, Alpha Phi, and Kappa Delta Council|url=http://www.denison.edu/campuslife/studentactivities/greek/phc.html|work=Panhellenic Council|publisher=Denison University|accessdate=November 19, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106011448/https://www.denison.edu/campuslife/studentactivities/greek/phc.html|archivedate=November 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] and [[Sigma Gamma Rho]] operate under the National Pan-Hellenic Council system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Pan-Hellenic Council|url=http://www.denison.edu/campuslife/studentactivities/greek/nphc.html|work=National Pan-Hellenic Council|publisher=Denison University|accessdate=November 19, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106011437/https://www.denison.edu/campuslife/studentactivities/greek/nphc.html|archivedate=November 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Multicultural Greek Council is host to the chapters of [[Sigma Lambda Gamma]], the Eta Colony of [[Alpha Sigma Rho]], [[Phi Iota Alpha]], [[Lambda Theta Alpha]] and the Gentlemen of Chi Sigma Tau - Zeta Chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multicultural Greek Council|url=http://www.denison.edu/campuslife/studentactivities/greek/mgc.html|work=Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=Denison University|accessdate=November 19, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106011508/https://www.denison.edu/campuslife/studentactivities/greek/mgc.html|archivedate=November 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Denison's [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] chapter is suspended from official recognition for violations of the Student Code of Conduct, while its [[Kappa Sigma]] chapter was restored to good standing at the beginning of the Fall semester of 2014. Additionally, an unrecognized chapter of [[Phi Gamma Delta]] (FIJI) operates at Denison alongside KZ, an unrecognized local fraternity. [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] was removed from campus following a hazing incident in 2001. The school administration does not extend recognition to these three latter groups, and as such, they are sometimes referred to by the student body as "underground fraternities." Previous fraternities to exist on campus, but are now inactive, include [[Delta Upsilon]] and [[Alpha Tau Omega]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter Statuses|url=http://www.denison.edu/campuslife/greek/greek_life_reports.html|publisher=Denison University|accessdate=November 19, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804015131/http://www.denison.edu/campuslife/greek/greek_life_reports.html|archivedate=August 4, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oltvai|first=Kristof|title=Fraternity investigations conclude with three different results|url=http://www.denisonian.com/2013/07/news/fraternity-investigations-conclude-with-three-different-results/|accessdate=May 1, 2014|newspaper=The Denisonian|date=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious life===
Denison is not religiously affiliated. However, there are religious organizations that add to the dynamic campus culture. Within religious life, Denison seeks to recognize the college's diversity and strives to create opportunities of inter religious experiences and dialogue to promote understanding and acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Life Organizations|url=http://www.denison.edu/offices/studentaffairs/handbook/religious.html|accessdate=February 8, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206065024/http://www.denison.edu/offices/studentaffairs/handbook/religious.html|archivedate=February 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the larger organizations include Denison Christian Community, Newman Catholic Club, Hillel, Muslim Students Association, and Agape Christian Fellowship. Other organizations represent the [[Quakers|Quaker]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Young Life]], [[Sikhism|Sikh]], and Hindu groups on campus. The Open House-Center for Religious and Spiritual Life, located on the South Quad of campus, is not exclusively for spiritual use. Students of all faiths and those with no faith tradition are welcome to come enjoy the homelike atmosphere while they study, enjoy a snack, play board games, meet new friends, or use the house for meetings of a non-religious nature.

===Traditions and folklore===
D-Day, the successor to the college's old Scrap Day, is a celebration of the entire college, put on once a year by the DCGA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heritage and Promise: Denison 1831-1981 |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=1981 |page=129 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kirtley F. Mather|Kirtley Mather]], Class of 1909, named the tallest peak in Alaska's Aleutian Peninsula "Mt. Denison." In 1978, a group of students, professors, and alumni successfully scaled the mountain—a feat repeated nearly 20 years later by another Denison group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Denison Magazine (Spring 2010) |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=2010 |page=31 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those buried on Sunset Hill are Jonathan Going, the college's second president, and [[Elisha Andrews]], its sixth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Denison Magazine (Spring 2010) |publisher=Denison University |location=Granville |year=2010 |page=26 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arts ==
The arts are prominent at Denison University. Students can major or minor in theatre, music, visual art, studio art, art history, dance, or cinema.

'''Diffeomorphometry''' is the metric study of imagery, shape and form in the discipline of [[computational anatomy]] (CA) in [[medical imaging]]. The study of [[image]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=January 2018}} in [[computational anatomy]] rely on high-dimensional [[diffeomorphism]] [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; which generate orbits of the form  &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I} \doteq

\{ \varphi \cdot I \mid \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \} &lt;/math&gt;, in which images &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; can be dense scalar [[Magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance]] or [[computed axial tomography]] images. For [[Deformable bodies|deformable shapes]] these are the collection of [[manifold]]s &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} \doteq

\{ \varphi \cdot M \mid \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \} &lt;/math&gt;,  points, [[Differential geometry of curves|curves]] and [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]]s. The diffeomorphisms move the images and shapes through the orbit according to &lt;math&gt;(\varphi,I)\mapsto \varphi \cdot I&lt;/math&gt; which are defined as the [[Group actions in computational anatomy|group actions of computational anatomy]].

The orbit of shapes and forms  is made into a metric space by inducing a metric on the group of diffeomorphisms.  &lt;nowiki/&gt;The study of metrics on groups of diffeomorphisms and the study of metrics between manifolds and surfaces has been an area of significant investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=M.

Informally, the [[Metric space|metric]]  is constructed by defining a flow of diffemorphisms &lt;math&gt;\dot \phi_t , t \in [0,1], \phi_t \in \operatorname{Diff}_V&lt;/math&gt; which connect the group elements from one to another, so for &lt;math&gt; \varphi,\psi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\phi_0 = \varphi , \phi_1=\psi&lt;/math&gt;.  The metric between two coordinate systems or diffeomorphisms is then the shortest length or [[Geodesic|geodesic flow]] connecting them. The metric on the space associated to the geodesics is given by&lt;math&gt;\rho(\varphi,\psi) = \inf_{\phi: \phi_0=\varphi,\phi_1 = \psi} \int_0^1 \| \dot \phi_t \|_{\phi_t} \, dt&lt;/math&gt;. The metrics on the orbits &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I},\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;  are inherited from the metric induced on the diffeomorphism group.&lt;nowiki/&gt;

The group &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; is thusly made into a smooth [[Riemannian manifold]] with Riemannian metric &lt;math&gt; \| \cdot \|_\varphi  &lt;/math&gt;  associated to the tangent spaces at all &lt;math&gt; \varphi \in\operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt;. The  &lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Riemannian metric]] satisfies at every point of the manifold &lt;math&gt; \phi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt; there is an  [[Inner product space|inner product]] inducing the norm  on the [[tangent space]] &lt;math&gt; \| \dot \phi_t  \|_{\phi_t} &lt;/math&gt;  that varies smoothly across &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Diff}_V &lt;/math&gt;.

Oftentimes, the familiar [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean metric]] is not directly applicable because the patterns of shapes and images don't form a [[vector space]]. In the [[Riemannian Metric and Lie-Bracket Interpretation of the Euler Equation on Geodesics|Riemannian orbit model of Computational anatomy]], diffeomorphisms acting on the forms &lt;math&gt;\varphi \cdot I \in \mathcal {I}, \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V, M \in \mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; don't act linearly. There are many ways to define metrics, and for the sets associated to shapes the [[Hausdorff metric]] is another. The method used to induce the [[Riemannian metric]] is to induce the metric on the orbit of shapes by defining it in terms of the metric length between diffeomorphic coordinate system transformations of the flows. Measuring the lengths of the geodesic flow between coordinates systems in the orbit of shapes is called '''diffeomorphometry'''.

== The diffeomorphisms group generated as Lagrangian and Eulerian flows ==

The diffeomorphisms in [[computational anatomy]] are generated to satisfy the [[Computational anatomy#Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms|Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow fields]], &lt;math&gt; \varphi_t,  t \in [0,1] &lt;/math&gt;, generated via the ordinary differential equation{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;

\frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t = v_t \circ \varphi_t , \ \varphi_0 = \operatorname{id}; &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Lagrangian flow}}}}

with the Eulerian vector fields &lt;math&gt; v \doteq (v_1,v_2,v_3) &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbb R}^3   &lt;/math&gt;  for &lt;math&gt;v_t = \dot \varphi_t \circ \varphi_t^{-1}, t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. The inverse for the flow is given by
&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{d}{dt} \varphi_t^{-1} = -(D \varphi_t^{-1}) v_t, \ \varphi_0^{-1} = \operatorname{id}, &lt;/math&gt;
and the &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; Jacobian matrix for flows in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;  given as &lt;math&gt; \ D\varphi \doteq \left(\frac{\partial \varphi_i}{\partial x_j}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

To ensure smooth flows of diffeomorphisms with inverse,  the vector fields &lt;math&gt;  {\mathbb R}^3   &lt;/math&gt; must be at least 1-time continuously differentiable in space&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;P. Dupuis, U. Grenander, M.I. Miller, Existence of Solutions on Flows of Diffeomorphisms, Quarterly of Applied Math, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;A. Trouvé.

\operatorname{Diff}_V \doteq \{\varphi=\varphi_1: \dot \varphi_t = v_t \circ \varphi_t , \varphi_0 = \operatorname{id}, \int_0^1 \|v_t \|_V \,dt &lt; \infty \} \ .

&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Diffeomorphism Group}}}}

==The Riemannian orbit model==

Shapes in [[Computational anatomy|Computational Anatomy (CA)]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;are studied via the use of diffeomorphic mapping for establishing correspondences between anatomical coordinate systems. In this setting, 3-dimensional medical images are modelled as diffemorphic transformations of some exemplar, termed the template &lt;math&gt; I_{temp} &lt;/math&gt;, resulting in the observed images to be elements of the random [[Computational anatomy#The deformable template orbit model of CA|orbit model of CA]]. For images these are defined as &lt;math&gt; I \in \mathcal {I}

\doteq \{ I = I_{temp} \circ \varphi, \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \} &lt;/math&gt;, with for charts representing sub-manifolds denoted as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \doteq \{ \varphi \cdot M_{temp} : \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \}&lt;/math&gt;.

===The Riemannian metric===

The orbit of shapes and forms in Computational Anatomy  are generated by the group action &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I} \doteq \{ \varphi \cdot I : \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \doteq \{ \varphi \cdot M : \varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V \}&lt;/math&gt;.   These are made into a Riemannian orbits by introducing a metric associated to each point and associated tangent space. For this a metric is defined on the group which induces the metric on the orbit. Take as the metric for [[Computational anatomy]] at each element of the tangent space &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in \operatorname{Diff}_V&lt;/math&gt; in the group of diffeomorphisms

:&lt;math&gt; \| \dot \varphi \|_\varphi \doteq \| \dot \varphi \circ \varphi^{-1} \|_V=\| v \|_V, &lt;/math&gt;

with the vector fields modelled to be in a Hilbert space with the norm in the [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt;. We model &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; as a [[Reproducing kernel Hilbert space|reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)]] defined by a 1-1, differential operator &lt;math&gt; A: V \rightarrow V^*  &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; V^*  &lt;/math&gt; is the dual-space. In general,   &lt;math&gt; \sigma \doteq Av \in V^* &lt;/math&gt; is a generalized function or distribution, the linear form  associated to the inner-product and norm for generalized functions are interpreted by integration by parts according to for &lt;math&gt;v,w \in V&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \langle v , w \rangle_V \doteq \int_X A v \cdot w \, dx, \ \| v\|_V^2 \doteq \int_X A v \cdot v \, dx, \ v,w \in V \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt; Av \doteq \mu \,dx &lt;/math&gt;, a vector density, &lt;math&gt;\int Av \cdot v \,dx \doteq \int \mu \cdot v \, dx = \sum_{i=1}^3 \mu_i v_i \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

The differential operator is selected so that the [[Green's function|Green's kernel]] associated to the inverse is sufficiently smooth so that the [[Computational anatomy#The Smoothness Condition on Vector fields as Modelled in a Reproducing kernel Hilbert space|vector fields support 1-continuous derivative]]. The [[Sobolev embedding]] theorem arguments were made in demonstrating that 1-continuous derivative is required for smooth flows. The [[Green's function for the three-variable Laplace equation|Green's]] operator generated from the [[Green's function]](scalar case) associated to the differential operator smooths.

For proper choice of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; (V,\| \cdot \|_V) &lt;/math&gt; is an RKHS with the operator &lt;math&gt; K = A^{-1}: V^* \rightarrow V &lt;/math&gt;.  The Green's kernels associated to the differential operator smooths since for controlling enough derivatives in the square-integral sense the kernel  &lt;math&gt; k(\cdot,\cdot)

&lt;/math&gt; is continuously differentiable in both variables implying

:&lt;math&gt; K Av (x)_i \doteq \sum_j \int_{{\mathbb R}^3}  k_{ij}(x,y) Av_j(y) \,dy \in V \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

== The diffeomorphometry of the space of shapes and forms ==

===The right-invariant metric on diffeomorphisms===

The metric on the group of diffeomorphisms is defined by the distance as defined on pairs of elements in the group of diffeomorphisms according to
: {{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt;
d_{\mathrm{Diff}_V}(\psi, \varphi) = \inf_{v_t} \left(\int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot v_t \, dx \, dt: \phi_0 = \psi, \phi_1 = \varphi, \dot \phi_t = v_t \circ \phi_t \right)^{1/2} \ .

===Surface geodesics===
For '''surfaces''', the Hamiltonian momentum is defined across the surface has Hamiltonian

: &lt;math&gt;H(\phi_t,p_t) =\frac{1}{2} \int_U \int_U p_t(u)\cdot K(\phi_t (m(u)), \phi_t (m(v))) p_t(v) \, du \, dv &lt;/math&gt;
and dynamics
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
v_t= \textstyle \int_U \displaystyle K(\cdot, \phi_t ( m(u)))p_t(u)\,du \ ,
\\
\dot p_t(u) = - (Dv_t)^T_{|_{\phi_t(m(u))} } p_t(u), u \in U
\end{cases}  &lt;/math&gt;
:The metric between surface coordinates &lt;math&gt;d^2 = (p_0 \mid v_0) =\int_U p_0(u) \cdot \int_U K(m(u), m(u^\prime)) p_0(u^\prime) \, du \, du^\prime &lt;/math&gt;

===Volume geodesics===
For '''volumes''' the Hamiltonian

: &lt;math&gt; H(\phi_t,p_t) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{{\mathbb R}^3} \int_{{\mathbb R}^3}  p_t(x)\cdot K(\phi_t(x),\phi_t(y)) p_t(y) \, dx \, dy \displaystyle &lt;/math&gt;

with dynamics

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
v_t=\textstyle \int_X \displaystyle K(\cdot, \phi_t(x))p_t(x)\,dx \ ,
\\
\dot p_t(x) = - (Dv_t)^T_{|_{\phi_t(x)} } p_t(x), x \in {\mathbb R}^3
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt; 
:The metric between volumes &lt;math&gt;
\displaystyle d^2  =(p_0\mid v_0) = \int_{\mathbb R^3}   p_0(x)\cdot \int_{{\mathbb R}^3}  K(x,y) p_0(y)\,dy \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Shimer Class Chicago.PNG|thumb|An egalitarian dialogue at [[Shimer College]].]]
'''Egalitarian dialogue''' is a dialogue in which contributions are considered according to the validity of their reasoning, instead of according to the status or position of power of those who make them.  Although previously used widely in the [[social sciences]] and in reference to the [[Bakhtin]]ian philosophy of [[dialogue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bakhtin in contexts: across the disciplines |page=142
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=081011268X|isbn=081011268X
|first=Amy |last=Mandelker |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was first systematically applied to [[dialogical education]] by [[Ramón Flecha]] in his 2000 work ''Sharing Words. Theory and Practice of Dialogic Learning''.

Egalitarian dialogue is one of the seven principles of [[dialogic learning]] (Flecha, 2000), the others being cultural intelligence, equality of differences, creation of meaning, instrumental dimension, solidarity, and transformation. The principle of egalitarian dialogue is deeply interrelated with the other principles of dialogic learning. By recognizing all people's [[cultural intelligence]] and respecting differences from an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] standpoint, egalitarian dialogue encourages individuals to create meaning, develop solidarity among different people, and create new instrumental dimensions. This interdependence among the principles of dialogic learning favors constant social transformation.

==Equality of differences==
The recognition and respect of different types of knowledge raises the awareness that each person has something to share, something different and equally important. Therefore, the wider the diversity of voices engaged in egalitarian dialogue, the better the knowledge that can be dialogically constructed. In this sense, dialogic learning is oriented towards equality of differences, stating that true equality includes the right to live in a different way (Flecha, 2000). This perspective, which [[Paulo Freire]] (1997) calls ''unity in diversity'', never defends diversity or difference without simultaneously proposing equality and fairness toward different individual and groups.

Equality of differences is also enacted in the Learning Communities (Valls, 2000; Elboj et al., 2001). The Learning Communities are schools in Spain, Brazil and Chile that have undergone a process of educational and social transformation based on dialogic learning. In the learning communities, the equality of differences principle is shown, among other practices, in the interactive groups (Aubert et al., 2004), where students and adults who have different levels of instruction and are from different backgrounds, teach and learn from each other. Those interactions create [[Zone of Proximal Development]] (Vygotsky, 1978), this showing that [[meaning-making]] and learning do not depend solely on the intervention of professionals, but on all the knowledge brought by anyone related to the students (Flecha, 2000).

==Creation of meaning==
Habermas (2004a, 2004b) has stressed the need to recover the [[lifeworld]] from its systemic colonization by the “steering media” of power, law and bureaucratization. The systemic decolonization is a way of reinventing democracy in public spaces and institutions and for recovering meaning. Habermas' concept of [[lifeworld]] refers to the everyday contexts where people relate to each other and create meaning and structures to organize themselves. In [[Habermas]]' view, and also from a dialogic learning perspective, subjects create meaning through [[intersubjectivity]] or the interaction among subjects engaged in egalitarian dialogue.

Any person can engage in such meaning making dialogue because humans have ''epistemological curiosity'', which when expressed in egalitarian dialogue can criticize and end with what Freire (2001) called the ''bureaucratizing of the mind'', an invisible power of alienating domestication. Such debureaucratization process can be seen in Dialogic Musical Gatherings (CONFAPEA, 2005), where people develop their epistemological curiosity listening to classical music and later engaging in a dialogue about the instruments that were playing, about the composer, his life and his position in a historical context, the style of the music listened to and its relationship with the cultural claims of each participant belonging to the Music Gathering, etc. In this process, meaning is created and recovered because music escapes the system and goes back to people's [[lifeworld]] tearing down the walls of cultural [[elitism]].

==Instrumental dimension==
The Instrumental Dimension of learning, as a principle of dialogic learning, should not be confused with instrumentality or the technocratic colonization of learning. In dialogic learning, as in [[Habermas]] (1984), the instrumental and [[communicative rationality]] are not opposed to each other, but instrumental learning becomes more intense and profound when situated in an adequate dialogical framework. The ability to select and process information is the cognitive tool that best enables one to function confidently in today's society. Dialogue and reflection encourage the development of that ability. Relationships with other people put not only diverse information but also its selection and processing at our disposal(Flecha, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;16). In addition, "when dialogue is egalitarian, it encourages intense reflection, since people need to understand other positions and express their own" (Flecha, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;16). In this sense, in egalitarian dialogue, procedures and ends are dialogically agreed. Those work for purposes of understanding, and do not let interactants hide themselves behind means that obscure exclusionary interests.

In education without dialogue, every single item becomes a target for power claims, even methods and instruments for learning, and therefore, the bureaucratization of those elements is inevitable. For this reason, the instrumental dimension of dialogic learning is never purely instrumental. It is also ethical, respectful, characterized by a sense of solidarity that contributes to break up the existing educational structure.

==Solidarity==
[[Social solidarity|Solidarity]] feeds dialogue, but at the same time, egalitarian dialogue, as essential communication, must underlie any act of solidarity (Freire, 1970). That is why, ''egalitarian educational practices must be grounded in conceptions of solidarity'' (Flecha, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;20).

The emphasis of [[dialogic learning]] on solidarity as the wheel that drives this perspective on education can be evidenced in the Learning Communities. For instance, in the School for Adults La Verneda-Sant Martí (Sánchez, 1999; Flecha, 2000) all the activities are open to anyone from the community and the city, and are also deeply integrated in the neighborhood. Because of discussing books from the classic literature through dialogic learning, the dialogic literary gatherings help improve the lives of the participants in the gathering but also of other people in the school and the neighborhood, when for example some participants in the gathering  take part of different committees of the school that plan actions of social transformation in the neighborhood, the city and beyond.

In this sense, solidarity is not only understood as an act for identifying and denouncing problems, but also as means to solve them. Solidarity does not only imply denouncing the process of dehumanization, but also announcing the dream of a new society (Freire, 2001). In this regard, solidarity goes beyond rebellious attitudes that do not propose an alternative, and reaches a more radically critical and dialogical position that implies the transformation of oneself, institutions, and the world.

Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. In 1741, at 53, he entered into a spiritual phase in which he began to experience dreams and visions, beginning on [[Easter]] Weekend, on 6 April 1744. It culminated in a 'spiritual awakening'
in which he received a revelation that he was appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ to write ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' to reform [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;See Swedenborg, E. [http://www.heavenlydoctrines.org/ ''The Heavenly Doctrine'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', the Lord had opened Swedenborg's spiritual eyes so that from then on, he could freely visit [[heaven]] and [[hell]] to converse with angels, demons and other spirits and the [[Last Judgment]] had already occurred the year before, in 1757.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/LJ.html Swedenborg, E. ''The Last Judgment and Babylon Destroyed. All the Predictions in the Apocalypse are at This Day Fulfilled.'' (Swedenborg Foundation 1952, Paragraphs 1–74)] Retrieved 16 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the last 28 years of his life, Swedenborg wrote 18 published theological works—and several more that were unpublished. He termed himself a "Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ" in ''True Christian Religion'',&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html |title=The True Christian Religion, Containing the Universal Theology of The New Church Foretold by the Lord in Daniel 7; 13, 14; and in Revelation 21; 1, 2, by Emanuel Swedenborg |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he published himself.&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html |title=Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation? |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some followers of ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' believe that of his theological works, only those that were published by Swedenborg himself are fully [[divine revelation|divinely inspired]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html "Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation?"]&lt;/ref&gt;   Others have regarded all Swedenborg's theological works as equally inspired, saying for example that the fact that some works were "not written out in a final edited form for publication does not make a single statement less trustworthy than the statements in any of the other works." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Odhner |first1=Carl Theophilus |title="Diary" and the Spiritual Body |journal=New Church Life |date=1912 |page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Church of the New Jerusalem is a branch of Christianity that reveres Swedenborg's writings as Divinely inspired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/508967814|title=Reasons for separating from the old church. : In answer to a letter received from certain persons in Manchester, who profess to believe in the heavenly doctrines of the New Jerusalem Church, as contained in the theological writings of the Late Hon.

== Early life ==
[[File:Hornsgatan 43 Emanuel Swedenborg Stockholm 2005-06-17 013.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque at the former location of Swedenborg's house at Hornsgatan on [[Södermalm]], [[Stockholm]].]]

Swedenborg's father, [[Jesper Swedberg]] (1653–1735), descended from a wealthy mining family. The first known paternal ancestor was Otte Persson from Sundborn parish, mentioned 1571.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.riddarhuset.se/att/swedenborg/|title=Riddarhuset - Ätte- och vapendatabas - Swedenborg|last=|first=|date=2017-06-04|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He travelled abroad and studied theology, and on returning home, he was eloquent enough to impress the Swedish king, [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]], with his sermons in [[Stockholm]]. Through the king's influence, he would later become professor of theology at [[Uppsala University]] and Bishop of [[Skara]].&lt;ref name="Ugglan"&gt;{{sv icon}} [[Nordisk familjebok]], 2nd edition (Ugglan) ''[http://runeberg.org/nfcg/0486.html article Svedberg, Jesper]'' (1918)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enc1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911|first=Alexander James |last=Grieve|wstitle=Swedenborg, Emanuel |volume=26 |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesper took an interest in the beliefs of the dissenting Lutheran [[Pietism|Pietist]] movement, which emphasised the virtues of communion with [[God]] rather than relying on sheer faith (''[[sola fide]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Svedberg's pietistic interests are described in Bergquist (1999), pp. 230–232.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sola fide'' is a tenet of the [[Lutheran Church]], and Jesper was charged with being a [[pietist]] [[heresy|heretic]]. While controversial, the beliefs were to have a major impact on his son Emanuel's spirituality. Jesper furthermore held the unconventional belief that [[angels]] and [[spirit]]s were present in everyday life. This also came to have a strong impact on Emanuel.&lt;ref name="Ugglan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lamm (1978 [1915]; pp.1–19) notes how all Swedenborg biographies at that draw similarities between the beliefs of Jesper and Emanuel. Lamm himself partially agrees with them, but he maintains that there were marked differences between them too.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1703–1709, Swedenborg lived in [[Erik Benzelius the Younger]]'s house. Swedenborg completed his university course at [[Uppsala]] in 1709, and in 1710, he made his [[grand tour]] through the Netherlands, France and Germany before reaching London, where he would spend the next four years. It was also a flourishing center of scientific ideas and discoveries. Swedenborg studied [[physics]], [[mechanics]] and [[philosophy]] and read and wrote [[poetry]]. According to the preface of a book by the Swedish critic [[Olof Lagercrantz]], Swedenborg wrote to his benefactor and brother-in-law Benzelius that he believed that Swedenborg might be destined to be a great scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, preface.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Delblanc&gt;x&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1715 Swedenborg returned to Sweden, where he devoted himself to natural science and engineering projects for the next two decades. A first step was his meeting with King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] in the city of [[Lund]], in 1716. The Swedish inventor [[Christopher Polhem]], who became a close friend of Swedenborg, was also present. Swedenborg's purpose was to persuade the king to fund an [[observatory]] in northern Sweden. However, the warlike king did not consider this project important enough, but did appoint Swedenborg to be assessor-extraordinary on the [[Swedish Board of Mines]] (''Bergskollegium'') in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;The meeting between the King, Polhelm and Swedenborg is described in detail in Liljegren, Bengt, ''Karl XII i Lund : när Sverige styrdes från Skåne'', (Historiska media, Lund, 1999). {{ISBN|91-88930-51-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1716 to 1718, Swedenborg published a scientific periodical entitled ''Daedalus Hyperboreus'' (''"The Northern [[Daedalus]]"''), a record of mechanical and mathematical inventions and discoveries. One notable description was that of a flying machine, the same he had been sketching a few years earlier (see [[Flying Machine (Swedenborg)]]).&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt;

In 1718, Swedenborg published an article that attempted to explain spiritual and mental events in terms of minute vibrations, or "tremulations".

Upon the death of Charles XII, [[Ulrike Eleonora of Sweden|Queen Ulrika Eleonora]] ennobled Swedenborg and his siblings. It was common in Sweden during the 17th and 18th centuries for the children of [[bishops]] to receive that honour, as a recognition of the services of their father. The family name was changed from Swedberg to Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp.114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1724, he was offered the chair of [[mathematics]] at [[Uppsala University]], but he declined and said that he had dealt mainly with [[geometry]], [[chemistry]] and [[metallurgy]] during his career. He also said that he did not have the gift of eloquent speech because of a stutter, as recognized by many of his acquaintances; it forced him to speak slowly and carefully, and there are no known occurrences of his speaking in public.&lt;ref&gt;Berquist (1999), pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish critic Olof Lagerkrantz proposed that Swedenborg compensated for his impediment by extensive argumentation in writing.&lt;ref&gt;Proposed by Lagercrantz, also mentioned by Bergquist (1999), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New direction of studies ahead of his time ==
During the 1730s, Swedenborg undertook many studies of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. He had the first known anticipation of the [[neuron]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;Fodstad, H. The neuron theory ''Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery'' 2001;77:20-4&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until a century later that science recognized the full significance of the nerve cell. He also had prescient ideas about the [[cerebral cortex]], the hierarchical organization of the [[nervous system]], the localization of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], the functions of the [[pituitary gland]], the perivascular spaces, the [[foramen of Magendie]], the idea of [[somatotopic arrangement|somatotopic organization]], and the association of frontal brain regions with the intellect. In some cases, his conclusions have been experimentally verified in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Gordh, E.

''Handbook Clinical Neurology'' 2010;95:557-70&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1730s, Swedenborg became increasingly interested in spiritual matters and was determined to find a theory to explain how matter relates to spirit. Swedenborg's desire to understand the order and the purpose of creation first led him to investigate the structure of matter and the process of creation itself. In the ''[[The Principia (book)|Principia]]'', he outlined his philosophical method, which incorporated experience, geometry (the means by which the inner order of the world can be known) and the power of reason. He also outlined his cosmology, which included the first presentation of his [[nebular hypothesis]]. (There is evidence that Swedenborg may have preceded Kant by as much as 20 years in the development of that hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newchurchhistory.org/articles/glb2007/baker.pdf Baker, Gregory L. (1983) "Emanuel Swedenborg – An 18th century cosmologist" in ''The Physics Teacher'', October 1983, pp. 441–6] Retrieved 15 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1735, in [[Leipzig]], he published a three-volume work, ''Opera philosophica et mineralis'' (''"Philosophical and mineralogical works''") in which he tried to conjoin philosophy and [[metallurgy]]. The work was mainly appreciated for its chapters on the analysis of the [[smelting]] of iron and copper, and it was the work that gave Swedenborg his international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 142–155.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he also published the small manuscript ''de Infinito'' ("On the Infinite") in which he attempted to explain how the finite is related to the infinite and how the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is connected to the body. It was the first manuscript in which he touched upon such matters. He knew that it might clash with established theologies since he presented the view that the soul is based on material substances.&lt;ref&gt;Lamm (1987), pp. 42–43, notes that by assuming that the soul consists of matter, as Swedenborg did, one becomes a [[materialist]]. He further notes that it was also noted by contemporaries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; He also conducted dedicated studies of the fashionable philosophers of the time such as [[John Locke]], [[Christian von Wolff]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and [[Descartes]] and earlier thinkers such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plotinus]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 165–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1743, at the age of 55, Swedenborg requested a leave of absence to go abroad. His purpose was to gather source material for ''Regnum animale'' (''The Animal Kingdom'', or ''Kingdom of Life''), a subject on which books were not readily available in Sweden. The aim of the book was to explain the soul from an anatomical point of view. He had planned to produce a total of 17 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc and Lönnroth, p.325.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Journal of Dreams'' ==
By 1744, Swedenborg had travelled to the Netherlands. Around the time, he began having strange dreams. Swedenborg carried a travel journal with him on most of his travels and did so on this journey. The whereabouts of the diary were long unknown, but it was discovered in the [[Royal Library of Sweden|Royal Library]] in the 1850s and was published in 1859 as ''Drömboken'', or ''Journal of Dreams''.

Swedenborg experienced many different dreams and visions, some greatly pleasurable, others highly disturbing.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, pp. 200–208.&lt;/ref&gt; The experiences continued as he traveled to London to progress the publication of ''Regnum animale''. This process, which one biographer has proposed as cathartic and comparable to the [[Catholic]] concept of [[Purgatory]],&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; continued for six months. He also proposed that what Swedenborg was recording in his ''Journal of Dreams'' was a battle between the love of himself and the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;Analysis by Bergquist, p. 209. Bergquist has previously published a separate book commenting on the Journal called ''Swedenborgs drömbok : glädjen och det stora kvalet'' (Stockholm, Norstedt, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visions and spiritual insights ===
In the last entry of the journal from 26–27 October 1744, Swedenborg appears to be clear as to which path to follow. He felt that he should drop his current project and write a new book about the worship of God. He soon began working on ''De cultu et amore Dei'', or ''The Worship and Love of God''. It was never fully completed, but Swedenborg still had it published in London in June 1745.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745, Swedenborg was dining in a private room at a tavern in London. By the end of the meal, a darkness fell upon his eyes, and the room shifted character. Suddenly, he saw a person sitting at a corner of the room, telling him: "Do not eat too much!". Swedenborg, scared, hurried home. Later that night, the same man appeared in his dreams. The man told Swedenborg that he was the Lord, that he had appointed Swedenborg to reveal the spiritual meaning of the Bible and that he would guide Swedenborg in what to write. The same night, the spiritual world was opened to Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Small Theological Works and Letters" by Emanuel Swedenborg. Edited and published by the Swedenborg Society (London, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scriptural commentary and writings ==
[[File:Arcana Caelestia 0001.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'', first edition (1749), title page.]]

In June 1747, Swedenborg resigned his post as assessor of the board of mines. He explained that he was obliged to complete a work that he had begun and requested to receive half his salary as a pension.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt; He took up afresh his study of [[Hebrew]] and began to work on the spiritual interpretation of the Bible with the goal of interpreting the spiritual meaning of every verse. From sometime between 1746 and 1747 and for ten years henceforth, he devoted his energy to the task. Usually abbreviated as ''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'' or under the [[Latin]] variant ''Arcana Caelestia''&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

Stephen McNeilly (London: Swedenborg Society, 2002), p. 1. Accessed 2010-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt; (translated as ''Heavenly Arcana'', ''Heavenly Mysteries'', or ''Secrets of Heaven'' depending on modern English-language editions), the book became his ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and the basis of his further theological works.&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was anonymous, and Swedenborg was not identified as the author until the late 1750s. It had eight volumes, published between 1749 and 1756. It attracted little attention, as few people could penetrate its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge. ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

His life from 1747 to his death was spent in Stockholm, the Netherlands and [[London]]. During the 25 years, he wrote another 14 works of a spiritual nature; most were published during his lifetime.

One of Swedenborg's lesser-known works presents a startling claim: that the Last Judgment had begun in the previous year (1757) and was completed by the end of that year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/LJ.html ''The Last Judgment and Babylon Destroyed. All the Predictions in the Apocalypse are At this Day Fulfilled from Things Heard and Seen''. From 'De Ultimo Judicio Et De Babylonia Destructa'']&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had witnessed it.&lt;ref&gt;''Last Judgment'', #60.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', the Last Judgment took place not in the physical world but in the World of Spirits, halfway between heaven and hell, through which all pass on their way to heaven or hell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/HH.html Swedenborg, E. ''Heaven and Its Wonders From Things Heard and Seen''] (Swedenborg Foundation 1946, #421–535).&lt;/ref&gt; The Judgment took place because the Christian church had lost its charity and faith, resulting in a loss of spiritual free will that threatened the equilibrium between heaven and hell in everyone's life.&lt;ref&gt;''Last Judgment'' #33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|For an extensive explanation of the inner spiritual sense of the book of the ''Apocalypse'', see Swedenborg, E. ''The Apocalypse Revealed Wherein are Disclosed the Arcana Foretold Which Have Hitherto Remained Concealed'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1928).}}

''The Heavenly Doctrine'' also teaches that the Last Judgement was followed by the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]], which occurred not by Christ in person but by a revelation from him through the inner, spiritual sense of the Word&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html |title = Swedenborg, E. ''The True Christian Religion: Containing the Universal Theology of The New Church Foretold by the Lord in Daniel 7; 13, 14; and in Revelation 21;1,2'' (Swedenborg Foundation 1952, paragraphs 193–215) |publisher = Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = |accessdate = 2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;''True Christian Religion'', paragraphs 753–786&lt;/ref&gt;

In another of his theological works, Swedenborg wrote that eating meat, regarded in itself, "is something profane" and was not practiced in the early days of the human race. However, he said, it now is a matter of conscience, and no one is condemned for doing it.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ac&amp;section=1002 ''Arcana Coelestia'' #1002, 1003] (Swedenborg Foundation, 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the early-days ideal appears to have given rise to the idea that Swedenborg was a [[vegetarian]]. That conclusion may have been reinforced by the fact that a number of Swedenborg's early followers were part of the vegetarian movement that arose in Britain in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ivu.org/history/thesis/bible-christian.html|title=The vegetarian movement in England, 1847–1981: A study in the structure of its ideology |last=Twigg |first=Julia |publisher=University of London |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the only reports on Swedenborg himself are contradictory. His landlord in London, Shearsmith, said he ate no meat, but his maid, who served Swedenborg, said that he ate eels and [[pigeon pie]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt, C. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epictc.htm ''The Swedenborg Epic: The life and works of Emanuel Swedenborg''] Bookman Associates, 1952, p. 476, # 642).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Earths in the Universe'', it is stated that he conversed with spirits from [[Jupiter]], [[Mars]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Saturn]], [[Venus]] and the [[Moon]] as well as spirits from planets beyond the [[solar system]].&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E.[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/EU.html ''The Earths in Our Solar System Which are called Planets and the Earths in the Starry Heaven, and Their Inhabitants; Also the Spirits and Angels There From Things Heard and Seen''] 1758. Also Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 9-178.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 'encounters', he concluded that the planets of our solar system are inhabited and that such an enormous undertaking as the universe could not have been created for just one race on a planet or one 'Heaven' derived from its properties per planet. Many Heavenly societies were also needed to increase the perfection of the angelic Heavens and Heaven to fill in deficiencies and gaps in other societies. He argued: "What would this be to God, Who is infinite, and to whom a thousand or tens of thousands of planets, and all of them full of inhabitants, would be scarcely anything!"&lt;ref&gt;''Arcana Coelestia'' #6698&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg and the question of life on other planets has been extensively reviewed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Simons K. [http://swedenborgproject.org/2007/09/08/the-life-on-other-planets-question/ The Life on Other Planets Question] The Swedenborg Project 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg published his work in London or the Netherlands because of their freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 477–478.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trobridge, G. ''Swedenborg, Life and Teaching'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1976, p. 272).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Swedenborg's grave.jpg|right|thumb|Swedenborg's crypt in [[Uppsala Cathedral]].]]
In July 1770, at the age of 82, he traveled to [[Amsterdam]] to complete the publication of his last work. The book, ''Vera Christiana Religio'' (''The True Christian Religion''), was published there in 1771 and was one of the most appreciated of his works. Designed to explain his teachings to [[Lutherans]], it is the most concrete of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In the summer of 1771, he traveled to London. Shortly before [[Christmas]], he suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed and confined to bed. His health improved somewhat, but he died in 1772. There are several accounts of his last months, made by those with whom he stayed and by Arvid Ferelius, a pastor of the Swedish Church in London, who visited him several times.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 471–476. Accounts of Swedenborg's last days were collected and published in Tafel II:1, pp. 577 ff, 556 ff, 560 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that Swedenborg wrote a letter to [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], in February. Swedenborg said that he had been told in the world of spirits that Wesley wanted to speak with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5plNwQ4xyfwC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=john+wesley+swedenborg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tv48ELMH0Y&amp;sig=xsFqXKc2uEibBH5YjydRkhEJmvM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=K0OgTbjLM5TUgQfBsd3lBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20wesley%20swedenborg&amp;f=false |title = Documents concerning the life and character of Emanuel Swedenborg – Johann Friedrich Immanuel Tafel – Google Books |publisher = Books.google.com |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley, startled since he had not told anyone of his interest in Swedenborg, replied that he was going on a journey for six months and would contact Swedenborg on his return. Swedenborg replied that that would be too late since Swedenborg would be going to the spiritual world for the last time on March 29.&lt;ref&gt;''Epic'', pp. 430ff.&lt;/ref&gt; (Wesley later read and commented extensively on Swedenborg's work.)&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. ''True Christianity, Containing a Comprehensive Theology of the New Church That Was Predicted by the Lord in Daniel 7:13–14 and Revelation 21:1, 2'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 2006, Translator's Preface, Vol. 2, p. 36 ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg's landlord's servant girl, Elizabeth Reynolds, also said that Swedenborg had predicted the date and that he was as happy about it as if he was "going on holiday or to some merrymaking":&lt;ref&gt;''Epic'', p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|In Swedenborg's final hours, his friend, Pastor Ferelius, told him some people thought he had written his theology just to make a name for himself and asked Swedenborg if he would like to recant.  Raising himself up on his bed, his hand on his heart, Swedenborg earnestly replied,

"As truly as you see me before your eyes, so true is everything that I have written; and I could have said more had it been permitted. When you enter eternity you will see everything, and then you and I shall have much to talk about".&lt;ref name="Epic 433"&gt;''Epic'', p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

He then died, in the afternoon, on the date he had predicted, March 29.&lt;ref name="Epic 433"/&gt; |}}
[[File:Swedenborg House London.jpg|thumb|Swedenborg House, London]]

He was buried in the [[Nordic churches in London#Swedish Church|Swedish Church]] in Princes Square in [[Shadwell]], London. On the 140th anniversary of his death, in 1912/1913, his remains were transferred to [[Uppsala Cathedral]] in Sweden, where they now rest close to the grave of the [[botanist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]]. In 1917, the [[Swedish Church]] in Shadwell was demolished, and the Swedish community that had grown around the parish moved to [[Marylebone]]. In 1938, Princes Square was redeveloped, and in his honour the local road was renamed Swedenborg Gardens. In 1997, a garden, play area and memorial, near the road, were created in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ukstreetmap.info/map-london-swedenborg-gardens-street.html |title = Street map Swedenborg Gardens, map London with Swedenborg Gardens |publisher=Ukstreetmap.info |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ewan-M Ewan Munro+ Add Contact |url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/55935853@N00/3111893982/ |title = Swedenborg Gardens, London Borough of Tower Hamlets, E1 - Flickr – Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastlondonhistory.com/2011/06/16/history-of-swedenborg-gardens/|title=History of Swedenborg Gardens - eastlondonhistory.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veracity ==
Swedenborg's transition from scientist to revelator or mystic has fascinated many people ever since it had occurred.

Swedenborg has had a variety of both supporting and critical biographers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/es.html "Who Was Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772)?"] An article including a list of biographies about Swedenborg, with a brief analysis of each biographer's point of view. Accessed June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some propose that he did not have a revelation at all but developed his theological ideas from sources that ranged from his father to earlier figures in the history of thought, notably [[Plotinus]]. That position was first and most notably taken by the Swedish writer Martin Lamm, who wrote a biography of Swedenborg in 1915 that is still in print.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The citation "Bergquist (1999)", which is used here repeatedly, appears to contain mislabelled quotes. See the "Talk" section of this page, under the heading "Bergquist footnote problem".}} [[Olof Lagercrantz]], the Swedish critic and publicist, had a similar point of view, calling Swedenborg's theological writing "a poem about a foreign country with peculiar laws and customs".&lt;ref&gt;''en dikt om ett främmande land med sällsamma lagar och seder''. Largercrantz (1996), backpage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg's approach to demonstrating the veracity of his theological teachings was to find and use voluminous quotations from the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] to demonstrate agreement between the Bible and his theological teachings. His demonstration of the agreement is found throughout his theological writings since he rejected blind faith and declared true faith to be an internal acknowledgement of the truth.

The vast and consistent use of Biblical confirmations in Swedenborg's theological writings led a Swedish Royal Council in 1771 to examine the heresy charges of 1770 against two Swedish supporters of his theological writings: "there is much that is true and useful in Swedenborg's writings".&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt (1952), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Hugo]], in Chapter 14 of ''[[Les misérables]]'', felt that Swedenborg had "lapsed into madness".

==Scientific beliefs==
Swedenborg proposed many scientific ideas during his lifetime. In his youth, he wanted to present a new idea every day, as he wrote to his brother-in-law [[Erik Benzelius the Younger|Erik Benzelius]] in 1718. Around 1730, he had changed his mind, and instead believed that higher knowledge is not something that can be acquired, but that it is based on intuition. After 1745, he instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge in a spontaneous manner from angels.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1745, when he considered himself to have entered a spiritual state, he tended to phrase his "experiences" in [[empirical]] terms, to report accurately things he had experienced on his spiritual journeys.

One of his ideas that is considered most crucial for the understanding of his theology is his notion of [[correspondence (theology)|correspondences]]. But, in fact, he first presented the theory of correspondences only in 1744, in the first volume of ''Regnum Animale'' dealing with the human soul.&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt;

The basis of the correspondence theory is that there is a relationship among the natural ("physical"), the spiritual, and the divine worlds. The foundations of this theory can be traced to [[Neoplatonism]] and the philosopher [[Plotinus]] in particular. With the aid of this scenario, Swedenborg now interpreted the Bible in a different light, claiming that even the most apparently trivial sentences could hold a profound spiritual meaning.&lt;ref name=Korr&gt;Lamm (1987 [1915]), dedicates a chapter to the correspondence theories, pp. 85–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg argued that it is the presence of that spiritual sense which makes the Word divine.&lt;ref&gt;(Swedenborg E, ''The True Christian Religion Containing the Universal Theology of the New Church.'' Swedenborg Foundation 1946, # 200)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prophetic accounts==
Four incidents of purported psychic ability of Swedenborg exist in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several versions of each story.

=== Fire anecdotes ===
On Thursday, 19 July 1759 a great and well-documented fire broke out in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.{{efn|The accounts are fully described in Bergquist, pp. 312–313 and in Chapter 31 of ''The Swedenborg Epic''. The primary source for these accounts is a letter from [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1768 and the Swedenborg collection by Tafel (see [[#Further reading|Further reading]]).}}&lt;ref name="brandhistoriska.org"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.brandhistoriska.org/olyckor_se.html |title = Årtal och händelser i Jönköping |publisher = Brandhistoriska.org |date = |accessdate = 2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staffan Högberg, ''Stockholms historia'' (Stockholm's history), part 1, p. 342; in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D-IYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR18&amp;lpg=PR18&amp;dq=%22documents+concerning+swedenborg%22+tafel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qu-XD4a3Ry&amp;sig=57fzfakBqB4wjrNlLqYXAZYycjo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LLi-SfEuhtYwnN_Qqgg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPR3,M1 For July 19 date see especially Documents 271–273 in ''Documents concerning the Life and Character of Emanuel Swedenborg Collected, Translated and Annotated by Tafel, RL.''

When the fire broke out Swedenborg was at a dinner with friends in [[Gothenburg]], about 400&amp;nbsp;km from Stockholm.  He became agitated and told the party at six o'clock that there was a fire in Stockholm, that it had consumed his neighbor's home and was threatening his own. Two hours later, he exclaimed with relief that the fire had stopped three doors from his home. In the excitement following his report, word even reached the ears of the provincial governor, who summoned Swedenborg that same evening and asked for a detailed recounting.

At that time, it took two to three days for news from Stockholm to reach Gothenburg by courier, so that is the shortest duration in which the news of the fire could reach Gothenburg.  The first messenger from Stockholm with news of the fire was from the Board of Trade, who arrived Monday evening.  The second messenger was a royal courier, who arrived on Tuesday.  Both of these reports confirmed every statement to the precise hour that Swedenborg first expressed the information.  The accounts are fully described in Bergquist, pp.&amp;nbsp;312–313 and in Chapter 31 of ''The Swedenborg Epic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic31.htm |title = The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 31 |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = |accessdate = 2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As noted above,  primary source for these accounts is a letter from [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1768 and the Swedenborg collection by Tafel (''Documents'' #271–273)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Swedenborg's biographer Lars Bergquist, however, this event took place on Sunday, July 29 – 10 days after the fire.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Bergquist: Swedenborgs Hemlighet, Stockholm 1999. {{ISBN|91-27-06981-8}}. (In Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

(Bergquist states, but does not document, that Swedenborg confirmed his vision of the fire incident to his good  friend, Consul Christopher Springer, "one of the pillars of the church, ... "a man of enviable reputation for virtue and intelligence",&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt S. [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic35.html ''The Swedenborg Epic,'' Chapter 35] Bookman 1952&lt;/ref&gt; "and that Swedenborg's innkeeper, Erik Bergström, heard Swedenborg affirming the story.&lt;ref&gt;Berguist, L. ''Swedenborg's Secret'' Swedenborg Foundation, 2005, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;)

It seems unlikely that the many witnesses to Swedenborg's distress during the fire, and his immediate report of it to the provincial governor,&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, L, ''Swedenborg's Secret'' (London, The Swedenborg Society, 2005, p. 270).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; would have left room for doubt in the public eye of Swedenborg's report.  If Swedenborg had only received news of the fire by the normal methods there would have been no issue of psychic perception recorded for history.  Instead, "when the news of Swedenborg's extraordinary vision of the fire reached the capital, public curiosity about him was very much aroused."&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt, Chapter 35&lt;/ref&gt;

A second fire anecdote, similar to the first one, but less cited, is the incident of the mill owner Bolander.  Swedenborg warned him, again abruptly, of an incipient fire in one of his mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic38.htm |title=The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 38 |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queen of Sweden===
The third event was in 1758 when Swedenborg visited Queen [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia|Louisa Ulrika]] of Sweden, who asked him to tell her something about her deceased brother [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia]]. The next day, Swedenborg whispered something in her ear that turned the Queen pale and she explained that this was something only she and her brother could know about.&lt;ref&gt;''Swedenborg Epic'' pp. 278ff.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|According to Bergquist (1999), pp. 314–315, There are several different accounts of the events which makes it difficult to conclude the exact details of the event. Carl Robsahm (see [[#Sources|reference]]) reports the story in this way.}}

=== Lost document ===
The fourth incident involved a woman who had lost an important document, and came to Swedenborg asking if a recently deceased person could tell him where it was, which he (in some sources) was said to have done the following night.{{efn|According to Bergquist (1999), p. 316, there are some ten different reports of this event. There are two trustworthy descriptions, one by Robsahm (writing down Swedenborg's own description) and one by a priest who enquired of the woman in a letter fifteen years later.}}

Although not typically cited along with these three episodes, there was one further piece of evidence:  Swedenborg was noted by the seamen of the ships that he sailed between Stockholm and London to always have excellent sailing conditions.&lt;ref name="Sigstedt, p. 329"&gt;Sigstedt, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked about this by a friend, Swedenborg played down the matter, saying he was surprised by this experience himself and that he was certainly not able to do miracles.&lt;ref name="Sigstedt, p. 329" /&gt;

== Kant's view ==

In 1763, [[Immanuel Kant]], then at the beginning of his career, was impressed by these accounts and made inquiries to find out if they were true.  He also ordered all eight volumes of the expensive ''Arcana Cœlestia'' (''Heavenly Arcana'' or ''Heavenly Mysteries''). One Charlotte von Knobloch wrote Kant asking his opinion of Swedenborg's psychic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Benz, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This letter is further discussed in Laywine, A., "Kant's Early Metaphysics". ''North American Kant Society Studies in Philosophy'', volume 3 (Atascadero, California: Ridgeview Publishing Company, 1993), pp. 72–74.}}  Kant wrote a very affirmative reply, referring to Swedenborg's "miraculous" gift, and characterizing him as "reasonable, agreeable, remarkable and sincere" and "a scholar," in one of his letters to [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]],&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; and expressing regret that he (Kant) had never met Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 202, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benz 2001, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Green (merchant)|Joseph Green]], his English friend, who investigated the matter for Kant, including by visiting Swedenborg's home, found Swedenborg to be a "sensible, pleasant and openhearted" man and here again, a scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, three years later, in 1766, Kant wrote and published anonymously a small book entitled ''Träume eines Geistersehers'' (''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'')&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, G., Magee, G. E. (Swedenborg Foundation 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; that was a scathing critique of Swedenborg and his writings. He termed Swedenborg a "spook hunter"&lt;ref&gt;Benz 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; "without official office or occupation."&lt;ref&gt;Benz, E., Heron, A. (Translator) ''Spiritual Vision and Revelation'', Chapter VI. ''The Mystery of a Date&amp;nbsp;– Fresh light on Kant's Criticism of Swedenborg'', p. 13, reprinted in ''The New Philosophy'' 2001 104:7,&lt;/ref&gt; As rationale for his critique, Kant said he wanted to stop "ceaseless questioning".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and inquiries about ''Dreams'' from "inquisitive" persons, both known and unknown",&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, G. Did Kant dissemble his interest in Swedenborg? "The New Philosophy" 1999, 102: 531&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's friend [[Moses Mendelssohn]] thought there was a "joking pensiveness" in ''Dreams'' that sometimes left the reader in doubt as to whether ''Dreams'' was meant to make "metaphysics laughable or spirit-seeking credible".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his letters to Mendelssohn, Kant refers to ''Dreams'' less-than-enthusiastically as a "desultory little essay".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant never closed off the possibility of [[mysticism]] or spirits in ''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'' and the exact relationship of his thought to Swedenborg's remains unclear, according to contemporary scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 185-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
{{Lutheranism}}
Swedenborg claimed in ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' that the teachings of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ were revealed to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture''#4, ''True Christian Religion'' # 859, 750, 779&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg considered his [[theology]] a revelation of the true Christian religion that had become obfuscated through centuries of theology. However, he did not refer to his writings as theology since he considered it based on actual experiences, unlike theology,&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt; except in the title of his last work. Neither did he wish to compare it to [[philosophy]], a discipline he discarded in 1748 because, he claimed, it ''"darkens the mind, blinds us, and wholly rejects the faith"''.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Bergquist (1999), p. 178, based on Swedenborg's ''Spiritual Experiences'' (1748), §767 (However, ''Spiritual Experiences'' is not among the works Swedenborg published himself, and thus may not be authoritative revelation. See [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html "Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of Swedenborg's theology was laid down in ''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'' (''Heavenly Mysteries''), published in eight Latin volumes from 1749 to 1756. In a significant portion of that work, he interprets the Biblical passages of Genesis and Exodus. He reviews what he says is the inner spiritual sense of these two works of the Word of God. (He later made a similar review of the inner sense of the book of Revelation in ''Apocalypse Revealed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/AR.html |title=The Apocalypse Revealed Wherein are Disclosed the Arcana Foretold Which Have Hitherto Remained Concealed |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Most of all, he was convinced that the Bible describes a human's transformation from a materialistic to a spiritual being, which he calls rebirth or regeneration. He begins this work by outlining how the [[creation myth]] was not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man's rebirth or regeneration in six steps represented by the six days of creation. Everything related to mankind in the Bible could also be related to [[Jesus Christ]], and how Christ freed himself from materialistic boundaries through the glorification of his human presence by making it Divine. Swedenborg examines this idea in his exposition of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 286–309.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
One often discussed aspect of Swedenborg's writing is his ideas on marriage. Swedenborg himself remained a bachelor all his life, but that did not hinder him from writing voluminously on the subject. His work on ''Marriage Love'' (''Conjugial Love''{{efn|"[[wiktionary:conjugial|conjugial]]" should not be confused with "[[wiktionary:conjugal|conjugal]]", the general term for marriage.}} in older translations) (1768) was dedicated to this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=1 |title = ML 1 – Small Canon Search – Reading – The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God – Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible – The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher = Small Canon Search |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central question with regard to marriage is whether it stops at death or continues into heaven. The question arises due to a statement of Jesus' that there is no marriage in heaven (Luke 20:27–38, Matthew 22:23–32, and Mark 12:18–27). Swedenborg wrote ''The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven'' as a detailed analysis of what he meant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.swedenborgproject.org/2011/08/22/the-lord-god-jesus-christ-on-marriage-in-heaven// |title = The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven |publisher = The Swedenborg Project |date = |accessdate = 2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of the relationship between husband and wife resumes in the spiritual world in whatever state it was at their death in this world. Thus, a couple in true marriage love remain together in that state in [[heaven]] into eternity. A couple lacking in that love by one or both partners, however, will separate after death and each will be given a compatible new partner if they wish. A partner is also given to a person who loved the ideal of marriage but never found a true partner in this world. The exception in both cases is a person who hates chaste marriage and thus cannot receive such a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=46 |title=Marriage Love 46–50) |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg saw creation as a series of pairings, descending from the Divine love and wisdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=dlw&amp;section=52 |title =Marriage Love #52 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; that define [[God]] and are the basis of [[:wikt:creation|creation]]. This duality can be seen in the pairing of good and truth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=84 |title=Marriage Love #84 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; charity and faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=fa&amp;section=1 |title=Marriage Love #1 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; God and the church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=117 |title = Marriage Love #117 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=83 |title=Marriage Love #83 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the goal for these pairs is to achieve [[wiktionary:conjunction|conjunction]] between the two component parts. In the case of marriage, the object is to bring about the joining together of the two partners at the spiritual and physical levels, and the happiness that comes as a consequence.

===Trinity===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
Swedenborg rejected the common explanation of the [[Trinity]] as a Trinity of Persons, which he said was not taught in the [[early Christian]] church. There was, for instance, no mention in the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostolic]] writings of any "Son from eternity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=tcr&amp;section=175 |title=TCR 175 – Small Canon Search – Reading – The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God – Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible – The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher=Small Canon Search |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he explained in his theological writings how the Divine Trinity exists in One Person, in One God, the Lord [[Jesus Christ]], which he said is taught in Colossians 2:9. According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', Jesus, the  [[Son of God]], came into the world due to the spread of evil here.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html ''The True Christian Religion'', particularly sections 163–184 ] (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/DL.html ''The Doctrine of the Lord'']  (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/AC.htm ''The Arcana Coelestia''] (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, various dates)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/njhd.html ''The New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine,'' particularly sections 280–310] New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg spoke in virtually all his works against what he regarded as the incomprehensible Trinity of Persons concept. He said that people of other religions opposed Christianity because of its doctrine of a Trinity of Persons. He considered the separation of the Trinity into three separate Persons to have originated with the [[First Council of Nicaea]] and the [[Athanasian]] Creed. According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' the Athanasian Creed is true, however, if the Trinity is understood to mean a Trinity in one person and that person being the Lord God Jesus Christ.

===''Sola Fide'' (Faith Alone)===
''The Heavenly Doctrine'' rejects the concept of salvation through [[faith alone|faith-alone]] (''sola-fide'' in Latin), since he considered both [[faith]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] necessary for [[salvation]], not one without the other, whereas the Reformers taught that faith-alone procured justification, although it must be a faith which resulted in obedience. The purpose of faith, according to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', is to lead a person to a life according to the truths of faith, which is charity, as is taught in 1 Corinthians 13:13 and James 2:20.

In other words, Swedenborg spoke sharply against the faith-alone doctrine of Luther and others.  He held that justification before God was not based solely upon some imputed righteousness before God, and was not achievable merely by a gift of God's grace (''sola gratia''), granted without any basis in a person's actual behavior in life.  ''Sola-fide'' was a doctrine averred by Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli and others during the Protestant Reformation, and was a core belief especially in the theology of the Lutheran reformers [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]].

Although the ''sola-fide'' doctrine of the Reformers also emphasized that saving faith was one that effected works&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org/Reformation_faith_works.html |title=Reformation Faith + Works |publisher=Peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (by faith-alone, but not by a faith which is alone), Swedenborg protested against faith-alone being the instrument of justification, and held that salvation is only possible through the conjunction of faith and charity in a person, and that the purpose of faith is to lead a person to live according to the truths of faith, which is [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]. He further states that faith and charity must be exercised by doing good out of willing good whenever possible, which are good works or good uses or the conjunction perishes. In one section he wrote:

{{quotation|It is very evident from their [[Epistles]] that it never entered the mind of any of the [[apostles]] that the church of this day would separate faith from charity by teaching that [[Sola fide|faith-alone]] justifies and saves apart from the works of the law, and that charity therefore cannot be conjoined with faith, since faith is from God, and charity, so far as it is expressed in works, is from man. But this separation and division were introduced into the Christian church when it divided God into three persons, and ascribed to each equal Divinity.|True Christian Religion, section 355&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblemeanings.info/books/tcr/sect-336ff.html#TCR355 |title=True Christian Religion, sections 336 ff |publisher=Biblemeanings.info |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Later history ==
Swedenborg made no attempt to found a church.&lt;ref&gt;Block, M.B [https://archive.org/details/newchurchinthene028276mbp ''The New Church in the New World. A Study of Swedenborgianism in America''] (Holt 1932; reprint Octagan 1968), Chapter 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benz, E. ''Emanuel Swedenborg. Visionary Savant in The Age of Reason'' (translated by Goodrick-Clarke (Swedenborg Foundation, 2002, p. 487).&lt;/ref&gt; A few years after his death&amp;nbsp;– 15 by one estimate&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, S. ''Emanuel Swedenborg'' (Chelsea House, 2005, p. 76).&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– for the most part in England, small reading groups formed to study his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As one scholar states, ''The Heavenly Doctrine''  particularly appealed to the various dissenting groups that sprang up in the first half of the 18th century who were "surfeited with revivalism and narrow-mindedness" and found his optimism and comprehensive explanations appealing.&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom, S. E. ''A Religious History of the American People'' (Yale 1972, p. 483).&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of important cultural figures, both writers and artists, were influenced by Swedenborg's writings, including [[Robert Frost]],&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Jeffrey, ''Robert Frost: A Biography'', Houghton Mifflin, 1996, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Johnny Appleseed]], [[William Blake]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Daniel Burnham]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.classic-literature.co.uk/scottish-authors/arthur-conan-doyle/the-history-of-spiritualism-vol-i/ebook-page-02.asp |title = Arthur Conan Doyle – The History of Spiritualism Vol I Page 02 |publisher=Classic-literature.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

T. Suzuki]], and [[W. B. Yeats]]. His philosophy had a great impact on the Duke of [[Södermanland]], later King [[Carl XIII]], who as the [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of Swedish [[Freemasonry]] (''Svenska Frimurare Orden'') built its unique system of degrees and wrote its rituals. In contrast, one of the most prominent Swedish authors of Swedenborg's day, [[Johan Henric Kellgren]], called Swedenborg "nothing but a fool".{{efn|[[Johan Henrik Kellgren]] published an often quoted satirical poem entitled ''Man äger ej snille för det man är galen'' ("''You Own Not Genius For That You are Mad''") in 1787. See Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth (1999). (''[[wikisource:sv:Man äger ej snille för det man är galen|Link to the full poem, in Swedish]]'')}} A [[heresy]] trial was initiated in Sweden in 1768 against Swedenborg writings and two men who promoted them.{{efn|The trial in 1768 was against Gabrial Beyer and Johan Rosén and was essentially concerned whether Swedenborg's theological writings were consistent with Christian doctrine. A royal ordinance in 1770 declared that writings were "clearly mistaken" and should not be taught. Swedenborg then begged the King for grace and protection in a letter from Amsterdam. A new investigation against Swedenborg stalled and was eventually dropped in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 453–463.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the two and a half centuries since Swedenborg's death, various [[The New Church (Swedenborgian)|interpretations]] of his theology have been made, and he has also been scrutinized in biographies and psychological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/es.html |title = Who was Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772)? |publisher = Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = 2006-11-19 |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|See "[[#Sources|Sources]]" and "[[#Further reading|Further reading]]" sections, below.}} Swedenborg, with his claimed new [[Dispensation (period)|dispensation]], has been considered by some to suffer from [[mental illness]].{{efn|[[Johan Henrik Kellgren]] published an often quoted satirical poem entitled ''Man äger ej snille för det man är galen'' (''You Own Not Genius For That You are Mad'') in 1787.

He mentions an earlier biography by the Swedish physician Emil Kleen who concluded that Swedenborg was blatantly mad, suffering "[[paranoia]] and [[hallucinations]]. A similar conclusion was proposed more recently by [[psychiatrist]] John Johnson in "Henry Maudsley on Swedenborg's messianic psychosis", ''British Journal of Psychiatry'' 165:690–691 (1994), who wrote that Swedenborg suffered hallucinations of "acute [[schizophrenia]] or epileptic [[psychosis]]". Another contemporary critique, Foote-Smith E, Smith TJ. Emanuel Swedenborg. ''Epilepsia'' 1996 Feb; 37(2):211-8, proposed that Swedenborg suffered from [[Temporal Lobe Epilepsy]].

While the insanity explanation was not uncommon during Swedenborg's own time, it is mitigated by his activity in the Swedish [[Riddarhuset]] (The House of the Nobility), the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] (the Swedish parliament), and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. Additionally, the system of thought in his theological writings is considered by some to be remarkably coherent.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, he was characterized by his contemporaries as a "kind and warm-hearted man", "amiable in his meeting with the public", speaking "easily and naturally of his spiritual experiences",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic37.htm |title = The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 37 |publisher = Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trobridge, G.''Swedenborg, Life and Teaching'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1976, p. 202.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://archive.org/details/emanuelswedenbor00trobuoft |title = Emanuel Swedenborg : his life, teachings and influence : Trobridge, George, 1851–1909 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher = Archive.org |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with pleasant and interesting conversation... An English friend of Kant's who visited Swedenborg at Kant's behest described Swedenborg as a "reasonable, pleasant and candid man and scholar".&lt;ref&gt;Benz, E. ''Emanuel Swedenborg. Visionary Savant in the Age of Reason''. (Swedenborg Foundation, 2002, pp. 226, 227.)&lt;/ref&gt; Of note here is Swedenborg's statement that he was commanded by the Lord to publish his writings and "Do not believe that without this express command I would have thought of publishing things which I knew in advance would make me look ridiculous and many people would think lies..."&lt;ref&gt;Block, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Copies of the original Latin version in which Swedenborg wrote his revelation are available from the following sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heavenlydoctrines.org/Writings%20Latin_title.html ''Online text from the Heavenly Doctrines database''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924163247/http://heavenlydoctrines.org/Writings%20Latin_title.html |date=2013-09-24 }}, From Heavenly Doctrine database.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baysidechurch.org/writings/ ''Online photocopy of first Latin edition published by Swedenborg''] From Bayside Church image database.&lt;/ref&gt;

List of referenced works by Swedenborg and the year they were first published.&lt;ref&gt;The original title, and year of publication is based on Bergquist (1999), ''Litteraturförteckning'' (pp.525–534).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://emanuelswedenborg.org/ The Works of Emanuel Swedenborg in Chronological Order], Emanuel Swedenborg Studies, accessed February 3, 2011 .&lt;/ref&gt;

''Swedenborg: his life and writings'' Bath : I. Pitman, Phonetic Institution, 1856) and this second one in 1867. White worked for the Swedenborg Society in London and wrote an affirmative biography of Swedenborg.  However, he was fired for publishing spiritist books and selling them at the Society's store, as well as otherwise interfering with the Society's function. White's response was the 1867 biography, in which he, in Tafel's words, "turn[ed] a complete somersault in his convictions," and wrote a highly derogatory biography of Swedenborg and his teachings.

A not-for-profit organisation, the '''European Language Resources Association''' ("ELRA") is established under the law of the Grand Duchy of [[Luxembourg]].  Its seat is in Luxembourg and its headquarters in [[Paris]] (France).

==Activities==
Since its foundation in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2016/pdf/1250_Paper.pdf Khalid Choukri, Valérie Mapelli, Hélène Mazo and Vladimir Popescu,  	LR Infrastructures and Architectures, LR National/International Projects, Infrastructural/Policy issues]&lt;/ref&gt; the European Language Resources Association has been a conduit for the '''distribution''' of speech, written and terminology Language Resources (LRs) for the Human [[Language Technology]] (HLT), a key compound of [[Information Society Technologies|IST]]. In order to do so, a number of technical and logistic, commercial (prices, fees, royalties), legal ([[License|licensing]], [[Intellectual Property]] Rights, Management), and information dissemination issues had to be addressed. Since its foundation, ELRA's mission has enlarged slightly, broadening its objectives and responsibilities towards the HLT community. ELRA is also involved in the '''production''', or commissioning of the production, of language resources through a number of initiatives, also actively committed to the '''evaluation''' of language engineering tools as well as to the '''identification''' of new resources. The set up of the identification number [[ISLRN]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2016/pdf/1251_Paper.pdf Valérie Mapelli, Vladimir Popescu, Lin Liu and Khalid Choukri,	Language Resource Citation: the ISLRN Dissemination and Further Developments]&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by NLP12 in 2013, is the most recent initiative led by ELDA to enhance the identification of Language Resources and their citation in publications.
Finally, every other year, ELRA organizes a major conference [[LREC]], the International Language Resources and Evaluation Conference.

==Mission==
The mission of the Association is to promote language resources and evaluation for the Human Language Technology sector in all their forms and their uses, in a [[Europe]]an context. Consequently, the goals are: to coordinate and carry out identification, production, validation, distribution, standardisation of languages resources, as well as support for evaluation of systems, products, tools, etc. Information Dissemination is also part of ELRA's missions which is carried through both the organisation of the conference [[LREC]] and the Language Resources and Evaluation Journal&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/journal/10579 Language Resources and Evaluation Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Springer.

==Antonio Zampolli Prize==
The ELRA Board has created a prize to honour the memory of its first president, Professor [[:it:Antonio Zampolli|Antonio Zampolli]], a pioneer and visionary scientist who was internationally recognized in the field of computational linguistics and Human Language Technologies (HLT). He also contributed much through the establishment of ELRA and the [[LREC]] conference. 
To reflect Antonio Zampolli’s specific interest in our field, the Prize is awarded to individuals whose work lies within the areas of Language Resources and [[Language Technology]] Evaluation with acknowledged contributions to their advancement. So far, the Antonio Zampolli Prize was awarded to:

* [[Frederick Jelinek]], from [[Johns Hopkins University]], Baltimore (USA), at LREC 2004, in [[Lisbon]].
* [[Christiane Fellbaum]] and [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]], from [[Princeton University]], Princeton (USA), at LREC 2006, in [[Genoa]].
* [[Yorick Wilks]], from the [[Oxford Internet Institute]] and the Computer Science Department of the [[University of Sheffield]] (UK), at LREC 2008, in [[Marrakech]].
* [[Mark Liberman]], from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], Philadelphia (USA), at LREC 2010, in [[Valletta]].
* [[Charles J. Fillmore|Charles Fillmore]] and Collin F. Baker, from the [[International Computer Science Institute]] (ICSI), University of California Berkeley (USA) and Oriental Committee for the Co-Ordination and Standardisation of Speech Databases and Assessment Techniques (Oriental COCOSDA), at LREC 2012, in [[Istanbul]].

==ELDA (Evaluations and Language Resources Distribution Agency)==
To handle every issues related to the association affairs, ELDA, Evaluations &amp; Language resources Distribution Agency, was created, as ELRA operational body. ELDA is responsible for the development and the execution of ELRA’s strategies and plans, and handles issues related to the distribution of language resources.

'''Fisheries Research Services''' (FRS) was an [[List of Scottish Executive agencies|Executive Agency]] of the [[Scottish Government]]. FRS was responsible for scientific and technical research into the marine and freshwater [[Scottish fisheries|fisheries]] and [[aquaculture]], and the protection of the aquatic [[Ecosystem|environment]] in [[Scotland]]. For these purposes, the agency had two fishery [[laboratories]], allowing specialisation in both marine and freshwater fisheries. The FRS also maintained two research vessels. 

On 1 April 2009, Fisheries Research Services was merged with the [[Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency]] and the Scottish Government Marine Directorate to form Marine Scotland, part of the core Scottish Government. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.frs-scotland.gov.uk/ Former FRS website] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The [[FRS Marine Laboratory|marine laboratory]] is based in Victoria Road, Aberdeen; and the freshwater laboratory is based in [[Pitlochry]], [[Perth and Kinross]]. The Agency also maintained other temporary research sites throughout Scotland. The Agency also had two [[research vessel]]s, {{ship|FRV|Scotia}} and {{ship|FRV|Alba-Na-Mara}}.

The Agency was directly funded by the Scottish Government, which made up around 60% of income. The other 40% was derived from research income for projects carried out in conjunction with other [[government bodies]] in [[Europe]]. The Agency also worked with private firms.

Low-mass stars have nearly vertical evolution tracks until they arrive on the main sequence. For more-massive stars, the Hayashi track bends to the left into the [[Henyey track]]. Even more-massive stars are born directly onto the Henyey track.&lt;br&gt;
The end (leftmost point) of every track is labeled with the star's mass in [[solar masses]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}), and represents its position on the main sequence.
The red curves labeled in years are isochrones at the given ages. In other words, stars &lt;math&gt;10^5&lt;/math&gt; years old lie along the curve labeled &lt;math&gt;10^5&lt;/math&gt;, and similarly for the other 3 isochrones.]]

The '''Hayashi track''' is a luminosity–temperature relationship obeyed by infant stars of less than {{Solar mass|3|link=y}} in the [[pre-main-sequence star|pre-main-sequence phase]] (PMS phase) of stellar evolution. It is named after Japanese astrophysicist [[Chushiro Hayashi]]. On the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], which plots luminosity against temperature, the track is a nearly vertical curve. After a [[protostar]] ends its phase of rapid contraction and becomes a [[T Tauri star]], it is extremely luminous. The star continues to contract, but much more slowly.  While slowly contracting, the star follows the Hayashi track downwards, becoming several times less luminous but staying at roughly the same surface temperature, until either a [[radiative zone]] develops, at which point the star starts following the [[Henyey track]], or nuclear fusion begins, marking its entry onto the [[main sequence]].

The shape and position of the Hayashi track on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram depends on the star's mass and chemical composition. For solar-mass stars, the track lies at a temperature of roughly 4000 K. Stars on the track are nearly fully convective and have their [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] dominated by hydrogen ions. Stars less than {{Solar mass|0.5}} are fully convective even on the main sequence, but their opacity begins to be dominated by [[Kramers' opacity law]] after nuclear fusion begins, thus moving them off the Hayashi track. Stars between 0.5 and {{Solar mass|3}} develop a radiative
zone prior to reaching the main sequence. Stars between 3 and {{Solar mass|10}} are fully radiative at the beginning of the pre-main-sequence. Even heavier stars are born onto the main sequence, with no PMS evolution.&lt;ref name=Palla2012/&gt;

At an end of a low- or intermediate-mass star's life, the star follows an analogue of the Hayashi track, but in reverse—it increases in luminosity, expands, and stays at roughly the same temperature, eventually becoming a [[red giant]].

==History==
In 1961, Professor [[Chushiro Hayashi]] published two papers&lt;ref name=hayashi1/&gt;&lt;ref name=hayashi2/&gt; that led to the concept of the [[pre-main-sequence]] and form the basis of the modern understanding of early stellar evolution. Hayashi realized that the existing model, in which stars are assumed to be in [[radiative equilibrium]] with no substantial convection zone, cannot explain the shape of the [[red giant branch]].&lt;ref name=Stahler1988/&gt;  He therefore replaced the model by including the effects of thick [[convection zone]]s on a star's interior.

A few years prior, [[Donald Edward Osterbrock|Osterbrock]] proposed deep convection zones with efficient convection, analyzing them using the opacity of H- ions (the dominant opacity source in cool atmospheres) in temperatures below 5000K.  However, the earliest numerical models of Sun-like stars did not follow up on this work and continued to assume radiative equilibrium.&lt;ref name=Palla2012/&gt;

In his 1961 papers, Hayashi showed that the convective envelope of a star is determined by:

&lt;math&gt;E = 4\pi G^{3/2}(\mu H/k)^{5/2}M^{1/2}R^{3/2}P/T^{5/2}&lt;/math&gt;

where E is unitless, and not the [[energy]].  Modelling stars as [[polytrope]]s with index 3/2—in other words, assuming they follow a pressure-density relationship of &lt;math&gt;P=K\rho^{5/3}&lt;/math&gt;—he found that E=45 is the maximum for a [[quasistatic process|quasistatic]] star.  If a star is not contracting rapidly, E=45 defines a curve on the HR diagram, to the right of which the star cannot exist.  He then computed the evolutionary tracks and [[Stellar isochrone|isochrones]] (luminosity-temperature distributions of stars at a given age) for a variety of stellar masses and noted that [[NGC2264]], a very young star cluster, fits the isochrones well.  In particular, he calculated much lower ages for solar-type stars in NGC2264 and predicted that these stars were rapidly contracting [[T Tauri stars]].

In 1962, Hayashi published a 183-page review of stellar evolution.  Here, he discussed the evolution of stars born in the forbidden region.  These stars rapidly contract due to gravity before settling to a quasistatic, fully convective state on the Hayashi tracks.

In 1965, numerical models by Iben and Ezer &amp; Cameron realistically simulated pre-main-sequence evolution, including the [[Henyey track]] that stars follow after leaving the Hayashi track.  These standard PMS tracks can still be found in textbooks on stellar evolution.

==Forbidden zone and Hayashi limit==

The '''forbidden zone''' is the region on the HR diagram to the right of the Hayashi track where no star can be in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], even those that are partially or fully radiative.  Newborn [[protostar]]s start out in this zone, but are not in hydrostatic equilibrium and will rapidly move towards the Hayashi track.

Because stars emit light via [[blackbody radiation]], the power per unit surface area they emit is given by the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;j^{\star} = \sigma T^4&lt;/math&gt;
The star's luminosity is therefore given by:
:&lt;math&gt;L = 4\pi R^2\sigma T^4&lt;/math&gt;

For a given L, a lower temperature implies a larger radius, and vice versa. Thus, the Hayashi track separates the HR diagram into two regions: the allowed region to the left, with high temperatures and smaller radii for each luminosity, and the forbidden region to the right, with lower temperatures and correspondingly higher radii.  The '''Hayashi limit''' can refer to either the lower bound in temperature or the upper bound on radius defined by the Hayashi track.

The region to the right is forbidden because it can be shown that a star in the region must have a temperature gradient of:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \ln T}{d \ln P} &gt; 0.4&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\frac{d \ln T}{d \ln P} = 0.4&lt;/math&gt; for a monatomic ideal gas undergoing [[adiabatic]] expansion or contraction.  A temperature gradient greater than 0.4 is therefore called superadiabatic.

Consider a star with a superadiabatic gradient.  Imagine a parcel of gas that starts at radial position r, but moves upwards to r+dr in a sufficiently short time that it exchanges negligible heat with its surroundings—in other words, the process is adiabatic.  The pressure of the surroundings, as well as that of the parcel, decreases by some amount dP.  The parcel's temperature changes by &lt;math&gt;dT = 0.4\frac{T}{P}dP&lt;/math&gt;.  The temperature of the surroundings also decreases, but by some amount dT' that is greater than dT.  The parcel therefore ends up being hotter than its surroundings.  Since the [[ideal gas law]] can be written &lt;math&gt;P = \frac{\rho RT}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;, a higher temperature implies a lower density at the same pressure.  The parcel is therefore also less dense than its surroundings.  This will cause it to rise even more, and the parcel will become even less dense than its new surroundings.

Clearly, this situation is not stable.  In fact, a superadiabatic gradient causes [[convection]].  Convection tends to lower the temperature gradient because the rising parcel of gas will eventually be dispersed, dumping its excess thermal and kinetic energy into its surroundings and heating up said surroundings.  In stars, the convection process is known to be highly efficient, with a typical &lt;math&gt;\frac{d \ln T}{d \ln P}&lt;/math&gt; that only exceeds the adiabatic gradient by 1 part in 10 million.&lt;ref name=struct_evol/&gt;

If a star is placed in the forbidden zone, with a temperature gradient much greater than 0.4, it will experience rapid convection that brings the gradient down.  Since this convection will drastically change the star's pressure and temperature distribution, the star is not in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], and will contract until it is.

A star far to the left of the Hayashi track has a temperature gradient smaller than adiabatic. This means that if a parcel of gas rises a tiny bit, it will be more dense than its surroundings and sink back to where it came from. Convection therefore does not occur, and almost all energy output is carried radiatively.

==Star formation==
Stars form when small regions of a [[giant molecular cloud]] collapse under their own gravity, becoming [[protostar]]s. The collapse releases gravitational energy, which heats up the protostar.  This process occurs on the [[Free fall|free-fall timescale]], which is roughly 100,000 years for solar-mass protostars, and ends when the protostar reaches approximately 4000 K.  This is known as the Hayashi boundary, and at this point, the protostar is on the Hayashi track.  At this point, they are known as [[T Tauri stars]] and continue to contract, but much more slowly.  As they contract, they decrease in luminosity because less surface area becomes available for emitting light. The Hayashi track gives the resulting change in temperature, which will be minimal compared to the change in luminosity because the Hayashi track is nearly vertical.  In other words, on the HR diagram, a T Tauri star starts out on the Hayashi track with a high luminosity and moves downward along the track as time passes.

The Hayashi track describes a fully [[convective]] star.  This is a good approximation for very young pre-main-sequence stars they are still cool and highly [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], so that [[radiative transport]] is insufficient to carry away the generated energy and convection must occur.  Stars less massive than {{Solar mass|0.5}} remain fully convective, and therefore remain on the Hayashi track, throughout their pre-main-sequence stage, joining the main sequence at the bottom of the Hayashi track. Stars heavier than {{Solar mass|0.5}} have higher interior temperatures, which decreases their central opacity and allows radiation to carry away large amounts of energy.  This allows a [[radiative zone]] to develop around the star's core. The star is then no longer on the Hayashi track, and experiences a period of rapidly increasing temperature at nearly constant luminosity.  This is called the [[Henyey track]], and ends when temperatures are high enough to ignite hydrogen fusion in the core.  The star is then on the [[main sequence]].

Lower-mass stars follow the Hayashi track until the track intersects with the main sequence, at which point hydrogen fusion begins and the star follows the main sequence.  Even lower-mass 'stars' never achieve the conditions necessary to fuse hydrogen and become [[brown dwarfs]].

==Derivation==
The exact shape and position of the Hayashi track can only be computed
numerically using computer models.  Nevertheless, we can make an extremely
crude analytical argument that captures most of the track's properties.  The
following derivation loosely follows that of Kippenhahn, Weigert, and Weiss in
''Stellar Structure and Evolution''.&lt;ref name=struct_evol/&gt;

In our
simple model, a star is assumed to consist of a fully convective interior
inside of a fully radiative atmosphere.

The convective interior is assumed to be an ideal monatomic gas with a perfectly adiabatic temperature gradient:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\ln{T}}{d\ln{P}} = 0.4&lt;/math&gt;

This quantity is sometimes labelled &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;.  The following
adiabatic equation therefore holds true for the entire interior:

:&lt;math&gt;P^{1-\gamma}T^{\gamma} = C&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[adiabatic gamma]], which is 5/3 for an ideal
monatomic gas.  The ideal gas law says:

:&lt;math&gt;P = NkT/V&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \frac{\rho kT}{\mu H}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= (\frac{k\rho C}{\mu H})^\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the molecular weight per particle and H is (to a very good
approximation) the mass of a hydrogen atom.  This equation represents a
[[polytrope]] of index 1.5, since a polytrope is defined by 
&lt;math&gt;P = K\rho^{1 + 1/n}&lt;/math&gt;, where n=1.5 is the polytropic index.  Applying 
the equation to the center of the star gives:
&lt;math&gt;P_c = (\frac{k\rho_c C}{\mu H})^\gamma&lt;/math&gt;
We can solve for C:
:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{\mu HP_c^{1/\gamma}}{\rho_c k}&lt;/math&gt;

But for any polytrope, &lt;math&gt;P_c = W_n\frac{GM^2}{R^4}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\rho_c = K_n\rho_{avg}&lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt;R^{\frac{3-n}{n}} M^{\frac{n-1}{n}} = \frac{K}{GN_n}&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;W_n, K_n,
N_n,&lt;/math&gt; and K are all constants independent of pressure and density,
and the average density is defined as 
&lt;math&gt;\rho_{avg} \equiv \frac{M}{4/3 \pi R^3}&lt;/math&gt;.  Plugging all 3 equations
into the equation for C, we have:

:&lt;math&gt; C \sim M^{2-\gamma} R^{3\gamma - 4}&lt;/math&gt;

where all multiplicative constants have been ignored.  Recall that our original
definition of C was:

:&lt;math&gt;P^{1-\gamma}T^\gamma = C&lt;/math&gt;

We therefore have, for any star of mass M and radius R:

:&lt;math&gt;P^{1-\gamma}T^\gamma \sim M^{2 - \gamma} R^{3\gamma - 4}&lt;/math&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\ln P = \frac{2-\gamma}{1-\gamma}\ln M + \frac{3\gamma - 4}
{1 - \gamma}\ln R - \gamma \ln T&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

We need another relationship between P, T, M, and R, in order to eliminate P.
This relationship will come from the atmosphere model.

The atmosphere is assumed to be thin, with average [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] k.  Opacity is
defined to be optical depth divided by density. Thus, by definition, the
optical depth of the stellar surface, also called the [[photosphere]], is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\tau}{dr} = k\rho&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \int_R^\infty k\rho dr&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = k\int_R^\infty \rho dr&lt;/math&gt;

where R is the stellar radius, also known as the position of the photosphere.
The pressure at the surface is:

:&lt;math&gt;P_0 = \int_R^\infty g\rho dr&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \frac{GM}{R^2}\int_R^\infty \rho dr&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = \frac{GM\tau}{kR^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The optical depth at the photosphere turns out to be &lt;math&gt;\tau = 2/3&lt;/math&gt;. By
definition, the temperature of the photosphere is &lt;math&gt;T = T_{eff}&lt;/math&gt; where effective
temperature is given by &lt;math&gt;L = 4\pi R^2T_{eff}^4&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore,
the pressure is:

:&lt;math&gt;P_0 = \frac{GM}{R^2}\frac{2}{3k}&lt;/math&gt;

We can approximate the opacity to be:

:&lt;math&gt;k = k_0P^aT^b&lt;/math&gt;

where a=1, b=3.  Plugging this into the pressure equation, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;P_0 = const(\frac{M}{R^2T_{eff}^b})^{\frac{1}{a+1}}&lt;/math&gt;
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\ln P_0 = \ln{const} + \frac{1}{a+1}(\ln{M} - 2\ln{R} - 
b\ln{T_{eff}}) &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Finally, we need to eliminate R and introduce L, the luminosity.  This can be
done with the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;L = 4\pi R^2\sigma T_{eff}^4&lt;/math&gt;
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\ln{R} = 0.5\ln{L} - 2\ln{T_{eff}} + const
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Equation {{EquationNote|1}} and {{EquationNote|2}} can now be combined by
setting &lt;math&gt;T=T_{eff}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P=P_0&lt;/math&gt; in Equation 1, then eliminating &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt;.
R can be eliminated using Equation {{EquationNote|3}}.  After some algebra,
and after setting &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 5/3&lt;/math&gt;, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln{T_{eff}} = A\ln{L} + B\ln{M} + const&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{0.75a-0.25}{5.5a+b+1.5}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{0.5a + 1.5}{5.5a+b+1.5}&lt;/math&gt;

In cool stellar atmospheres (T &lt; 5000 K) like those of newborn stars, 
the dominant source of opacity is the H- ion, for which 
&lt;math&gt;a \approx 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \approx 3&lt;/math&gt;, we get 
&lt;math&gt;A = 0.05&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = 0.2&lt;/math&gt;.

Since A is much smaller than
1, the Hayashi track is extremely steep: if the luminosity changes by a factor
of 2, the temperature only changes by 4 percent.  The fact that B is positive
indicates that the Hayashi track shifts left on the HR diagram, towards higher
temperatures, as mass increases.  Although this model is extremely crude, these
qualitative observations are fully supported by numerical simulations.

At high temperatures, the atmosphere's opacity begins to be dominated by
[[Kramers' opacity law]] instead of the H- ion, with a=1 and b=-4.5  In that
case, A=0.2 in our crude model, far higher than 0.05, and the star is no longer
on the Hayashi track.

In ''Stellar Interiors'', Hansen, Kawaler, and Trimble go through a similar
derivation without neglecting multiplicative constants,&lt;ref name=interiors/&gt; 
and arrived at:

:&lt;math&gt;T_{eff} = (2600 K)\mu^{13/51}(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}})^{7/51}(\frac{L}{L_{\odot}})^{1/102}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the molecular weight per particle.  The authors note that the coefficient of 2600K is too
low—it should be around 4000K—but this equation nevertheless shows that
temperature is nearly independent of luminosity.

==Numerical results==
[[File:Hayashi composition.png|thumb|Hayashi tracks of a {{Solar mass|0.8}} star with helium mass fraction 0.245, for 3 different metallicities]]

The diagram at the top of this article shows numerically computed stellar 
evolution
tracks for various masses.  The vertical portions of each track is the Hayashi
track.  The endpoints of each track lie on the main sequence.
The horizontal segments for higher-mass stars show the [[Henyey track]].

It is approximately true that: 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \ln{T_{eff}}}{\partial \ln{M}} \approx 0.1&lt;/math&gt;.

The diagram to the right shows how Hayashi tracks change with changes in
chemical composition.  Z is the star's [[metallicity]], the mass fraction not
accounted for by hydrogen or helium.  For any given hydrogen mass fraction,
increasing Z leads to increasing molecular weight.  The dependence of 
temperature on molecular weight is extremely steep—it is approximately
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \ln{T_{eff}}}{\partial \ln{\mu}} \approx -26&lt;/math&gt;.
Decreasing Z by a factor of 10 shifts the track right, changing 
&lt;math&gt;\ln{T_{eff}}&lt;/math&gt; by about 0.05.

Chemical composition affects the Hayashi track in a few ways.  The
track depends strongly on the atmosphere's opacity, and this opacity is
dominated by the H- ion.  The abundance of the H- ion is proportional to the
density of free electrons, which, in turn, is higher if there are more metals
because metals are easier to ionize than hydrogen or helium.

==Observational status==
[[File:Ngc 2264.png|thumb|The young star cluster NGC 2264, with a large number of T Tauri stars contracting towards the main sequence.  The solid line represents the main sequence, while the two lines above that are the &lt;math&gt;10^{6.5}&lt;/math&gt; yr (upper) and &lt;math&gt;10^{6.7}&lt;/math&gt; yr (lower) isochrones.]]

Observational evidence of the Hayashi track comes from color-magnitude plots—the observational equivalent of HR diagrams—of young star clusters.&lt;ref name=Palla2012/&gt; For
Hayashi, [[NGC 2264]] provided the first evidence of a population of contracting
stars. In 2012, data from NGC 2264 was re-analyzed to account for dust
reddening and extinction.  The resulting color-magnitude plot is shown at
right.

In the upper diagram, the isochrones are curves along which stars of a certain 
age
are expected to lie, assuming that all stars evolve along the Hayashi track.
An isochrone is created by taking stars of every conceivable mass, evolving
them forwards to the same age, and plotting all of them on the color-magnitude
diagram.
Most of the stars in NGC 2264 are already on the main sequence (black line), 
but a substantial population lies between the isochrones for 3.2 million and 5
million years, indicating that the cluster is 3.2-5 million years old and a large population of T Tauri stars is still on their respective Hayashi tracks.
Similar results have been obtained for NGC 6530, IC 5146, and NGC 6611.&lt;ref name=Palla2012/&gt;

[[File:T Tauri tracks.png|thumb|The numbered curves show the Hayashi tracks of stars of that mass (in solar masses).  The small circles represent observational data of T Tauri stars.  The bold curve to the right is the birthline, above which few stars exist.]]

The lower diagram shows Hayashi tracks for various masses, along with T Tauri
observations collected from a variety of sources.  Note the bold curve to
the right, representing a [[stellar birthline]].  Even though some Hayashi tracks
theoretically extend above the birthline, few stars are above it.  In effect,
stars are 'born' onto the birthline before evolving downwards along their
respective Hayashi tracks.

The birthline exists because stars formed from overdense cores of giant molecular
clouds in an inside-out manner.&lt;ref name=Stahler1988/&gt;  That is, a small central region first
collapses in on itself while the outer shell is still nearly static.  The outer
envelope then accretes onto the central protostar.  Before the accretion is 
over, the protostar is hidden from view, and therefore not plotted on the
color-magnitude diagram.  When the envelope finishes accreting, the star is
revealed and appears on the birthline.

In [[anthropology]], a '''house society''' is a society where [[kinship]] and political relations are organized around membership in corporately-organized dwellings rather than around [[descent group]]s or [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]s, as in the "[[House of Windsor]]". The concept was originally proposed by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] who called them "''sociétés à maison''".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lévi-Strauss |first=Claude |title=The Way of the Mask |year=1982 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. 1987. Anthropology and Myth: Lectures, 1951-1982. R. Willis, trans. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been applied to understand the organization of societies from [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Moluccas]] to [[North Africa]] and medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Rosemary A. &amp; Susan D. Gillespie (eds.). 2000. Beyond Kinship: Social and Material Reproduction in House Societies. University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carsten, Janet &amp; Stephen Hugh-Jones (eds.) About the House: Lévi-Strauss and Beyond. Cambridge University Press, May 4, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The House society is a hybrid, transitional form between kin-based and class-based social orders, and is not one of Lévi-Strauss' '[[Alliance theory|elementary structures]]' of kinship. Lévi-Strauss introduced the concept as an alternative to 'corporate kinship group' among the cognatic kinship groups of the Pacific region. The socially significant groupings within these societies have variable membership because kinship is reckoned bilaterally (through both father's and mother's kin) and come together for only short periods. Property, genealogy and residence are not the basis for the group's existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Errington |first=Shelly |title=Meaning and Power in a Southeast Asian Realm |year=1989 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== House societies and kinship ==

Lévi-Strauss' most succinct definition of a House was that it is "a corporate body holding an estate made up of both material and immaterial wealth, which perpetuates itself through the transmission of its name, its goods and its titles down a real or imaginary line considered legitimate as long as this continuity can express itself in the language of kinship or of affinity and, most often, of both."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lévi-Strauss |first=Claude |title=The Way of the Mask |year=1982 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three elements to this definition:&lt;ref name="Schrauwers 2004 75–6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and Class: On the Importance of Capitals in central Sulawesi |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |year=2004 |volume=160 |issue=1 |pages=75–6 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The House is a corporate body ("moral person") holding an estate made up of both material and immaterial goods.
# As a "moral person", it is an alternate metaphor replacing "blood" in defining the social identity of the group. As a symbol of the group, the House persists over generations and links the group to its sacred origins.
# The House persists over time by transmitting its titles through conditional kinship principles: "patrilineal descent and matrilineal descent, filiation and residence, hypergamy and hypogamy, close marriage and distant marriage, heredity and election: all these notions which usually allow anthropologists to distinguish the various known types of society, are united in the house, as if, in the last analysis the spirit (in the eighteenth-century sense) of this institution expressed an effort to transcend, in all spheres of collective life, theoretically incompatible principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lévi-Strauss |first=Claude |title=The Way of the Mask |year=1982 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the core group (the highest-ranking members) will inhabit the House as a residence. The other House members (which Errington refers to as the "server group") will only come together on special ritual occasions, making this an "occasional kinship group." Other House members have multiple overlapping ties to other Houses as well, through both mother's and father's kin. Their ability to assert a claim to membership in a House will depend on a number of criteria, such as their parents' participation, their ability to contribute to the House's upkeep, and their participation in its rituals. Successful claims of membership may bring special benefits, such as the right to utilize House resources with the consent of the core members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Errington |first=Shelly |title=Meaning and Power in a Southeast Asian Realm |year=1989 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |pages=233–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== House societies and social ranking ==

Most of the examples of ‘sociétés à maison’ cited by Lévi-Strauss, with the exception of the [[Kwakwaka'wakw|Kwakiutl]] Indians of the North-west coast of Canada, were [[Feudalism|feudal]]. This has led some to ask if feudalism was an essential feature of House societies, and answering in the negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waterson |first=Roxanna |title=About the House: Lévi-Strauss and Beyond |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=53–4 |chapter=Houses and hierarchies in island Southeast Asia |editor=Carsten J. and S. Hugh-Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schrauwers, in contrast, has argued that House societies are characteristically organized around a system of [[Social stratification|social ranks]], not feudalism. That is, the House is not an economic class but a socially ranked group (e.g. a nobility) in a society organized around a system of social ranks; while a House may own property, it is thus not tied to a feudal mode of production. Schrauwers gives, as an alternate example, societies organized around slavery where a noble group's property are its slaves (such as the Kwakiutl case).&lt;ref name="Schrauwers 2004 75–6"/&gt;

== Houses and politics ==
{{Political anthropology}}

Houses are political in three ways; there is an intra-House politics by which leadership is determined and resources are allocated within the House, as well as an inter-House politics between rival Houses. These two forms of political engagement may be connected through agonistic exchange institutions such as the [[Potlatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Errington |first=Shelly |title=Meaning and Power in a Southeast Asian Realm |year=1989 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |pages=96–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, lastly, also a politics of struggle and incorporation between highly ranked noble Houses and those groups like slaves and commoners who lack the resources to maintain their organization as a House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and Class: On the Importance of Capitals in central Sulawesi |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |year=2004 |volume=160 |issue=1 |pages=86–90 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intra-House political struggle===
Houses are tied together through oftentimes contradictory forms of kinship, whether descent or alliance. Given that Houses are not lineages, leadership is rarely ascribed by genealogical seniority alone (i.e. [[primogeniture]]). Leadership of a House is gained through status competition.

===Inter-House political struggle===
A number of traditional Southeast Asian kingdoms, such as those in [[Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|Bali]], or the kingdom of [[Luwu]] in Sulawesi, were dominated by noble Houses that competed with each other for control of the state. These states have alternately been described as [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]] states.

===Political struggles between classes within a House society===
Although they may be referred to as House Societies, not all societies with Houses have those Houses uniformly distributed among all ranks and classes. The House in Bali, as well as in the kingdom of Luwu in Sulawesi, is an "optional" kinship group. Schrauwers has argued that class and House formation are linked. He points out, for example, that the inherited estate of some Sulawesi House societies in the kingdom of Luwu is composed of slaves; that is, the House's property is composed of another social rank of individuals. In this case, class and rank are synonymous. Because they are property, slaves are prevented from forming their own Houses. Commoners in those societies are of a different rank, but lack property, and therefore cannot form their own houses either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and Class: On the Importance of Capitals in central Sulawesi|journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde|year=2004|volume=160|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way in which these lower classes were prevented from forming Houses was two-fold. On the one hand, they might be engaged in the agonistic exchange systems with Noble Houses that results in their using up and losing all of their House property. On the other hand, noble Houses at the centre of the state might engage in policies of divide and rule, urging different groups at the periphery to attack each other, take slaves, and these would form Houses which then intermarry with the Houses at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title=Houses, hierarchy, headhunting and exchange; Rethinking political relations in the Southeast Asian realm of Luwu |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |year=1997 |volume=153 |issue=3 |pages=356–80 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Disability}}

The '''Individualized Education Program''', also called the '''IEP''', is a document that is developed for each [[State school|public school]] child who needs special education. The IEP is created through a team effort, reviewed periodically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/what-is-an-iep/ |title=What is an IEP? |publisher=GreatKids |date=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], this program is known as an Individualized Education Program .(IEP), and similarly in [[Canada]] it is referred to as an Individualized Education Plan or a Special Education Plan (SEP). In [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], an equivalent document is called an '''Individual Education System'''. In [[Saudi Arabia]], the document is known as an '''Individual Education Program'''.{{Sfn|Alquraini|2011|p=151}}

An IEP defines the individualized objectives of a child who has been determined to have a disability or requires specialized accommodation, as defined by federal regulations. The IEP is intended to help children reach educational goals more easily than they otherwise would.&lt;ref name = 34CFR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2007-title34-vol2/xml/CFR-2007-title34-vol2-sec300-320.xml |title=34 C.F.R. 300.320 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases the IEP must be tailored to the individual student's needs as identified by the IEP evaluation process, and must especially help teachers and related service providers (such as [[paraprofessional educator]]s) understand the student's disability and how the disability affects the learning process.

The IEP describes how the student learns, how the student best demonstrates that learning and what teachers and service providers will do to help the student learn more effectively. Developing an IEP requires evaluating students in all areas related to the suspected disabilities, simultaneously considering ability to access the general curriculum, considering how the disability affects the student’s learning, forming goals and objectives that correspond to the needs of the student, and choosing a placement in the [[least restrictive environment]] possible for the student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=La Salle|first1=Tamika|last2=Roach|first2=Andrew|last3=McGrath|first3=Dawn|title=The Relationship of IEP Quality to Curricular Access and Academic Achievement for Students with Disabilities|journal=International Journal of Special Education|date=2013|volume=28|issue=1|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As long as a student qualifies for special education, the IEP is mandated to be regularly maintained and updated up to the point of high school graduation, or prior to the 21st birthday or 22nd birthday. If a student in special education attends [[university]] upon graduation, the university's own system and procedures take over. Placements often occur in "general education," [[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstream]] classes, and specialized classes or sub-specialties taught by a [[special education]] teacher, sometimes within a [[resource room]].

An IEP is meant to ensure that students receive an appropriate placement, not only in special education classrooms or [[special schools]]. It is meant to give the student a chance to participate in regular school culture and academics as much as is possible for that individual student. In this way, the student is able to have specialized assistance only when such assistance is absolutely necessary, and otherwise maintains the freedom to interact with and participate in the activities of his or her more general school peers.

==Definition of individualized==
The individual needs of each child in the IEP. Such as resources available to ensure they receive accurate education according to their needs.

== Saudi Arabia ==
In Saudi Arabia, all schools must provide an IEP for all students who have disabilities.{{Sfn|Alquraini|2011|p=156}} The process of creating an IEP in Saudi Arabia may exclude the parents and other providers of services.{{Sfn|Alquraini|2011|p=156}}

==United States==
In the US, the [[IDEA 2004|Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA)]] requires public schools to develop an IEP for every student with a disability who is found to meet the federal and state requirements for [[special education]].&lt;ref name = 1400d&gt;20 U.S.C. §1400(d)(1) A)&lt;/ref&gt; The IEP must be designed to provide the child with a [[Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)]]. The IEP refers both to the educational program to be provided to a child with a disability and to the written document that describes that educational program.
The IDEA requires that an IEP be written according to the needs of each student who is eligible under the IDEA; an IEP must also meet state regulations. The following must be included.
*The student's present levels of academic and functional performance
*Measurable annual goals, including academic and functional goals
*How the student's progress toward meeting annual goals is to be measured and reported to the parents
*Special-education and related services, as well as supplementary aids to be provided to the student
*Schedule of services to be provided, including when the services are to begin, the frequency, duration and location for the provision of services
*Program modifications or supports provided to school personnel on behalf of the child
*Least Restrictive Environment data which includes calculations of the amount of time to be spent each day by the student in general-education settings as opposed to the amount of time to be spent in special-education settings
*Explanation of any time the child will not participate along with non-disabled children
*Accommodations to be provided during state and district assessments that are necessary to the measuring the student's academic and functional performance&lt;ref&gt;Purdue University, [http://online.purdue.edu/sped/masters-special-education/resources/what-is-special-ed "What is Special Education?"], ''Purdue University'', 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*The student should attend when appropriate. If the student is over fourteen, he or she should be invited to be a part of the IEP team.
*Additionally, when the student is sixteen years of age, a statement of post-secondary goals and a plan for providing what the student needs to make a successful transition is required.&lt;ref name = 1400d/&gt; This transition plan can be created at an earlier age if desired, but must be in place by the age of sixteen.

An IEP must also include other pertinent information found necessary by the team, such as a health plan or a behavior plan for some students.

== Canada ==
In Canada, an Individual Education Plan (IEP) is often referred to as a Special Education Plan (SEP), Individualized Program Plan (IPP), Student Support Plan (SSP), or an Individual Support Services Plan (ISSP) depending on the province or territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://caddac.ca/adhd/document/the-individual-education-plan-iep/|title=The Individual Education Plan (IEP) - Centre for ADHD Awareness Canada|work=Centre for ADHD Awareness Canada|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IEP system in Canada functions very similarly relative to the US, however regulations vary between provinces.

==Procedural requirements for development==
The outcome of the IEP development process is an official document that describes the education plan designed to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability.

===Determination of eligibility for special education===
{{details|Special education in the United States}}
&lt;!-- Consider adding article for Qualifying for only special education services --&gt;
Before an IEP is written for a child with a disability, the school must first determine whether the child qualifies for special education services. To qualify, the child's disability must have an adverse effect on the child's educational progress.&lt;ref name="parentcenterhub.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/repository/categories/|title=Categories of Disability Under IDEA {{!}} Center for Parent Information and Resources|website=www.parentcenterhub.org|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine eligibility, the school must conduct a full evaluation of the child in all areas of suspected disability. Based in part on the results of the evaluation, the school along with the parents meet to review the results and the child's current level of performance and to determine whether special education services are needed.

If the child is found eligible for services, the school is required to convene an IEP team and develop an appropriate educational plan for the child. The IEP should be implemented as soon as possible after the child is determined eligible. IDEA does not state specific time-frames for each step. However, some states have added specific timelines that schools must follow for the eligibility, IEP development, and IEP implementation milestones.

As outlined by IDEA, students can receive free appropriate education under special education law if they fall under one of 14 categories:&lt;ref name="parentcenterhub.org"/&gt;

1. [[Autism]]

2. [[Deafblindness|Deaf-blindness]]

3. [[Hearing loss|Deafness]]

4. [[Developmental delay|Developmental]] delay (for children aged 3–9, varies by state)

5. [[Emotional and behavioral disorders]]

6. [[Hearing Impairment|Hearing]] impairment

7. [[Intellectual disability|Intellectual]] disability (formerly referred to as mental retardation)

8. [[Multiple disabilities|Multiple]] disabilities

9.  Orthopedic impairment

10. Other health impairment

11. Specific learning disability

12. Speech or language impairment

13. [[Traumatic brain injury|Traumatic]] brain injury

14. [[Visual impairment|Visual]] impairment, including blindness

While teachers and school psychologists have the ability to initiate evaluations for special education service eligibility, they are unqualified to make medical diagnoses.  Attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and physical and developmental delays must be diagnosed by a physician.  Although most children with physical or developmental delays, who have received consistent medical care, are diagnosed at an early stage by their pediatricians, it is imperative to include a medical professional in the student’s evaluation process if one of the aforementioned conditions is suspected, but undiagnosed.  When children are diagnosed early, they can start receiving services at earlier stages of development.  State health and/or education departments offer early intervention services for children under the age of three years.  The public school system offers services for children from ages three through twenty-one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/repository/evaluation/|title=Evaluating Children for Disability {{!}} Center for Parent Information and Resources|website=www.parentcenterhub.org|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Members of the IEP team===
The IEP team includes the student, the student's parent(s) or legal guardian(s), a special education teacher, at least one general-education teacher, a representative of the school or of the school district who is knowledgeable about the availability of school resources, and an individual who can interpret the instructional implications of the results of the student's evaluation (such as the school psychologist).&lt;ref name = 34CFR/&gt;

The parent or school may also bring other individuals who have knowledge or special expertise regarding the child. For example, the school may invite related service providers such as speech and occupational therapists. The parent may invite professionals who have worked with or assessed the child, or someone to assist the parent in advocating for the needs of his or her child, such as a parent advocate or an attorney.

If appropriate, the child may also participate in IEP team meetings. For example, some children begin participating in their IEP meetings when they reach middle school age.

A typical IEP team, and team meeting includes:

* One or both of the child's parents. Consistent with the IDEA's stated policy, parents should expect to be treated as equal participants with school personnel in developing the IEP.
* A case manager or a representative of the school district (not the student's teacher) who is qualified to provide or supervise [[special education]].
* The student's teacher(s), and principal(s). If the child has more than one teacher, then all teachers are invited to attend, with at least one teacher required to attend.
* If the program to be recommended includes activities with general education students, even if the child is in a special education class in the school, a general education teacher is required to attend.
* Any provider of a related service to the child. Normally this would be speech therapy, occupational therapy, or adapted physical education.
* Professionals who are qualified to explain the results of the testing. Usually this requires at least the presence of a psychologist and educational evaluator, if an assessment or report is reviewed. This usually occurs at the 3-year review, or triennial IEP.
* Parents may bring with them any others involved with the child who they feel are important for the IEP team to hear; for example, the child's psychologist or tutor.
* Parents may elect to bring an educational advocate, a social worker, and/or a lawyer knowledgeable in the IEP process.
* Although not required, if the student is receiving related services (such as speech therapy, music therapy, physical therapy or occupational therapy), it is valuable for related service personnel to attend the meeting or at least provide written recommendations concerning the services in their area of specialty.
* The student's guidance counselor may be needed in attendance to discuss courses that may be required for the student for his or her education.

===Role of the parents===
Parents are to be considered full and equal members of the IEP team, along with school personnel.&lt;ref name = 34CFR/&gt; Parents have the right to be involved in meetings that discuss the identification, evaluation, IEP development, and educational placement of their children. They also have the right to ask questions, dispute points, and request modifications to the plan, as do all members of the IEP team. 

Although IEP teams are required to work toward consensuses, school personnel ultimately are responsible for ensuring that the IEP includes the services that the student needs. School districts are obligated by law to make a proposal for services to the parent. If an agreement cannot be reached, the school district cannot delay in providing the services which it believes are the best services to ensure that the student receives an effective educational program.

Under IDEA Part D, the United States Department of Education funds at least one parent training and information center in each state and most territories to provide parents the information they need to advocate effectively for their child.&lt;ref&gt;20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(11))&lt;/ref&gt; Some centers may also provide a knowledgeable person to accompany a parent to IEP meetings to assist the parent in the process.

The school is mandated to make an effort to ensure that one or both of the parents are present at each IEP team meeting. If parents do not attend, the school is required to show that due diligence was made to enable the parents to attend, including notifying the parents early enough that they have an opportunity to attend, scheduling the meeting at a mutually agreed on time and place, offering alternative means of participation, such as a phone conference.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The school is required to ensure that the parent understands the proceedings of IEP team meetings, including arranging for an interpreter for parents who are deaf or whose native language is not English.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing the student's education plan===
After the student is determined to be eligible for special education services, the IEP team is required to develop an individual education plan to be implemented as soon as possible after eligibility is determined. Using the results of the full individual evaluation (FIE), the IEP team works together to identify the student's present level of educational performance, as well as the student's specific academic and any related or special services that the child needs in order to benefit from their education.

When developing an IEP, the team must consider the strengths of the student, the concerns of the parent for their student's education, results of the initial or most recent evaluation of the child (including private evaluations conducted by the parents), and the academic, developmental, and functional needs of the child. The team must also consider areas of deficits. Corresponding annual goals and objectives should be created to improve the deficit areas. In the case of a child whose behavior impedes the student's learning or that of other children, the team is required to consider the use of Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports to address the behavior. An FBA may be required by the team to address the behavioral concerns. An FBA is conducted by a child psychologist with input from the IEP team.

The IEP team is required to consider the communication needs of the child. For example, if a child is blind or visually impaired, the IEP is mandated to provide for instruction in Braille and the use of Braille unless an evaluation of the child's reading and writing skills, needs, and future needs indicate that this instruction is not appropriate for the child. If a child is deaf or hard of hearing, the team is required to consider the child's language and communication needs, including the need to communicate with school personnel and peers, and the child's need for direct instruction in the child's language and communication mode. In the case of a child with [[limited English proficiency]], the team is required to consider the language needs of the child as those needs relate to the child's IEP.

A matrix is drafted containing the student’s present level of performance, indicators about ways the student’s disability influences participation and progress in the general curriculum, a statement of measurable goals, including benchmarks or short-terms objectives, the specific educational services to be provided, including program modifications or supports, an explanation of the extent that the child will not participate in general education, a description of all modifications in statewide or district-wide assessments, the projected date for initiation of the services and the expected duration of those services, the annual statement of transition service needs (beginning at age 14), and a statement of interagency responsibilities to ensure continuity of services when the student leaves school (by age 16), a statement regarding how the student’s progress will be measured and how the parents will be informed in the process.

IDEA requires a child's IEP be developed solely based on the child's needs, and not based on pre-existing programs or services available in the district. Whether particular services are available in the district should not be considered when identifying the services a child needs to receive an appropriate education.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Determining the appropriate placement==

After the IEP is developed, the IEP team determines placement—that is, the environment in which the child's IEP can most readily be implemented. IDEA requires that the IEP be complete before placement decisions are made so that the child's educational needs drive the IEP development process. Schools may not develop a child's IEP to fit into a pre-existing program for a particular classification of disability. The IEP is written to fit the student. The placement is chosen to fit the IEP.

IDEA requires state and local education agencies to educate children with disabilities with their non-disabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate. A child can only be placed in a separate school or special classes if the severity or nature of the disability is such that appropriate education cannot be provided to the child in the regular classroom, even with the use of supplementary aids and services. When determining placement, the starting assumption must be the student's current academic level and needs as evident by the disability.

Some of the more common placement settings include the general education classroom, an integrated class, a resource class, a self-contained class, and other settings, which include separate schools and residential facilities.  A school system may meet its obligation to ensure that the child has an appropriate placement available by: providing an appropriate program for the child on its own, consulting with another agency to provide an appropriate program, or utilizing some other mechanism/arrangement that is consistent with IDEA.  The placement group will base its decision on the IEP and which placement option is appropriate for the child.&lt;ref&gt;Kupper, L. (Ed.). (2007, March 23). Guide to the Individualized Education Program. Retrieved September 17, 2017, from https://www2.ed.gov/parents/needs/speced/iepguide/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  The general education classroom is seen as the least restrictive environment. In addition to the general education teacher, there will also ideally be a Special Education teacher. The special education teacher adjusts the curriculum to the student's needs. Most school-age IEP students spend at least 80 percent of their school time in this setting with his or her peers. Research suggests student's with special needs benefit from being included in general education and from participation in the general education curriculum.&lt;ref name = Friend&gt;{{cite book |author=Friend, Marilyn |title=Special Education: Contemporary Perspectives for School Professionals|publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J |year=2010 |pages=56–59 |isbn=0-13-703327-3 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An integrated classroom is made up of mostly neuro-typical children with several children who have IEPs. These are typically higher functioning children with disabilities that require help in areas of social skills. This setting allows them to model the behavior of the neuro-typical children. Typically there is an aide in this classroom setting to assist those children with IEPs.

The next setting is a resource class where the Special Education teacher works with small groups of students using techniques that work more efficiently with the students. This setting is available for students who spend between 40- 79 percent of their time in the general education classroom. The term “resource” in this context refers to the amount of time spent outside general education, not the form of instruction.&lt;ref name = Friend/&gt;

Another setting option is a separate classroom. When students spend less than 40 percent of their day in the general education class, they are said to be placed in a separate class. Students are allowed to work in small, highly structured settings with a special education teacher. Students in the separate class may be working at different academic levels. Other settings include separate schools and residential facilities. Students in these settings receive highly specialized training to address both special learning and behavioral needs. The students will acquire both academic and life skills instruction. These schools have the highest degree of structure, routine, and consistency.

==Implementation==
After the IEP is developed and placement is determined, the student's teachers are responsible for implementing all educational services, program modifications or supports as indicated by the individual education plan.

Schools are required to have an IEP in effect at the beginning of the school year. Initial IEPs are required to be developed within 30 days of the determination of eligibility, and the services specified in the child's IEP are required to be provided as soon as possible after the IEP is developed.

===Annual review===
The IEP team is responsible for conducting an annual review to ensure that the student is meeting goals and/or making progress on the benchmarks specified for each objective. If an IEP is not helping the student in the classroom, an immediate revision is to occur.

===Acceptance and amendments===
An initial IEP is required to be accepted and signed by a parent or guardian before any of the outlined services may begin. Formerly parents had 30 calendar days to take the paper work home for their consideration. Currently the IEP must be signed or appealed within 10 days, or the school can implement the most recent version.

==Procedural safeguards==
School personnel have an obligation to provide parents with a Procedural Safeguards Notice, which is required to include an explanation of all of the procedural safeguards built into IDEA. In addition, the information must be in understandable language and in the native language of the parent.

A copy of the Procedural Safeguards Notice is required to be presented at an IEP meeting. The school is required to give the parent a copy of the child's IEP at no cost to the parent.&lt;ref&gt;20 U.S.C. 1414(d)(1)(B)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;

An extensive system of conflict resolution procedures are set out in the statutory provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1415 |title=20 U.S.C. 1415 |publisher=Cornell University Law School Legal Information Institute |accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include: the right to examine records, advance notification of intent to change the educational program, the right to engage in mediation, and a right to an impartial due process hearing.

==Services that may be provided to a child with a disability==
*Specially designed instruction
*Parental involvement
*Related services
*Program modifications
*[https://adayinourshoes.com/printable-list-of-strategies-sdis-for-your-iep-meeting/ Classroom accommodations]
*Supplementary aids and services
*[[Resource room]]

===Specially designed instruction===
Specially designed instruction affects the instructional content, method of instructional delivery, and the performance methods and criteria that are necessary to assist the student make meaningful educational progress. This instruction is designed by or with an appropriately credentialled special education teacher or related service provider. Students may have better success with small-group instruction as presented in a resource room (mandated by program and placement outlined in the IEP) particularly with languaged-based instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thorson |first=Sue |date=November 1995 |title=Macbeth in the Resource Room: Students with Learning Disabilities Study Shakespeare |journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities |volume=28 |pages=575–581 |issn=0022-2194 |doi=10.1177/002221949502800907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some students, teachers may need to present information through the use of manipulatives. For other students, teachers may need to select and teach only important key concepts and then alter evaluation activities and criteria to match this content change.

The IEP team determines whether a specific type of instruction is included in a student’s IEP. Generally, if the methodology is an essential part of what is required to meet the individualized needs of the student, the methodology is included. For instance, if a student has a learning disability and has not learned to read using traditional methods, then another method is used. When including such an IEP recommendation, the Team describes the components of the appropriate type of methodology, as opposed to naming a specific program.

=== Parental Involvement ===
Researchers have proven the importance of parental involvement in a child’s education. In fact, James Griffith (1996) found that schools having higher levels of parental involvement and empowerment also had higher student criterion-referenced test scores. Although much attention has been focused on ways of involving the parent in school activities, little has been written on how to better involve parents of special education students. The U.S. Office of Education 1998 revisions of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (I.D.E.A.) contained major changes specifically designed to increase the parent’s involvement in the educational process. These revisions required school districts to invite the parent to be involved in the diagnosis of the disability, determination of need for special education programs and services and the extent to which the child would receive these services. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1174&amp;context=colleagues|title=Parental Involvement: Transdisciplinary Service

With Special Education Students|last=Cross|first=Robert J.|date=5/31/2012|website=Grand Valley State University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related services===
If the child needs additional services in order to access or benefit from special education, schools are required to provide the related services. These are including, but not limited to, speech therapy, occupational or physical therapy, interpreters, medical services (such as a nurse to perform procedures the child needs during the day, for example, catheterization), orientation and mobility services, parent counseling and training to help parents support the implementation of their child's IEP, psychological or counseling services, recreation services, rehabilitation, social work services, and transportation.

===Program modifications===

* Modifications to the content of the program
* Lowered success criteria for academic success
* Decrease alternative state assessments, such as off-grade level assessments

===[https://adayinourshoes.com/printable-list-of-strategies-sdis-for-your-iep-meeting/ Classroom accommodations]===
Some of a student's educational needs may be met using accommodations. Accommodations are typically provided by general educators within the general education environment. Accommodations do not involve modifying the material content but do allow students to receive information or to demonstrate what they have learned in ways that work around their impairment, thereby minimizing the likelihood of a significant disability. For example, a child may complete fewer/different parts of a homework assignment or an assessment than other students.  They may also write shorter papers or be given different projects and assignments in replacement of the original task.

Accommodations may also include such provisions as preferential seating, providing photocopies of teacher notes, giving oral rather than written quizzes, extended time for tests and assignments, use of a word processor or laptop, taking tests in a quiet room, prompts and reminders for focus, breaks for sensory needs, and assistance with specific subject areas.

Modifications in the curriculum can occur if a student needs to learn material that the class has moved on from, like working on exponents while the class is moving on to applying them in the order of operations. They also may occur in grading rubrics, where a student with an IEP may be assessed on different standards than other students.

===Supplementary aids and services===
*[https://adayinourshoes.com/assistive-technology-iep-special-education/ Assistive technology]
*Teacher's aide in classroom that provide additional support for one or more specific students

===Transportation===
If necessary a student will be provided with specialized transportation. This can be the case if the student has a severe disability and requires a wheelchair, or is identified with an emotional problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4774">'''Inner-worldly asceticism''' was characterized by [[Max Weber]] in ''[[Economy and Society]]'' as the concentration of human behavior upon activities leading to salvation within the context of the everyday world.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Elton, ''Reformation Europe'' (1969) p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

He saw it as a prime influence in the emergence of [[modernity]] and the technological world,&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (1972) p. 14 and p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; a point developed in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''.

==Four-fold typology==

Weber's [[Ideal type|typology]] of religion set off the distinction between asceticism and [[mysticism]] against that between inner-worldly and other-worldly orientations, to produce a four-fold set of religious types.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talcott Parsons]], Introduction, Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p. li&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pawel Stefan Zaleski "Ideal Types in Max Weber’s Sociology of Religion: Some Theoretical Inspirations for a Study of the Religious Field", ''Polish Sociological Review'' No. 3(171)/2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to Talcott Parsons, otherwordly stances provided no leverage upon socio-economic problems, and inner-worldly mystics attached no significance to the material world surrounding them,&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, p. li-lii&lt;/ref&gt; the inner-worldly ascetic acted within the institutions of the world, while being opposed to them, and as an instrument of God. However Stefan Zaleski showed that inner-worldly mysticism that is magic was interested in active transformation of reality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In religions which can be characterized by inner-world-asceticim, the world appears to the religious virtuoso as his responsibility.&lt;ref name="weber_asceticism"&gt;Weber, Max. "Asceticism, Mysticism and Salvation." In ''Economy and society; an outline of interpretive sociology''.. New York: Bedminster Press, 1968. 542.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationalism==

For Weber, the worldly ascetic is a rationalist. He rationalizes his own conduct but also rejects conduct which is specifically irrational, esthetic, or dependent upon his own emotional reactions to the world.&lt;ref name="weber_asceticism2"&gt;Weber, Max. "Asceticism, Mysticism and Salvation." In ''Economy and society; an outline of interpretive sociology''.. New York: Bedminster Press, 1968. 544.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inner-worldly asceticism, including above all [[Protestantism]], taught the fulfillment of obligations in the world as the sole method of proving religious merit. Its emphasis on the importance of one's [[Vocation|calling]] encouraged the differentiation of life-spheres, while its rationality favoured an emphasis on [[natural law]]&lt;ref&gt;David Owen, ''Maturity and Modernity'' (1994) p. 11-7&lt;/ref&gt; – further aspects enhancing the impact Weber postulated such asceticism had upon the development of [[capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 528&lt;/ref&gt; or rather the particular type of capitalism Weber saw as marked by "the rational organization and institutionalization of social relationships...rational bourgeois capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Weber, ''Sociology'' p. 183 and p. lix&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

* Critics have challenged the validity of Weber's linking of Calvinism, and predestination in particular, with the emergence of the capitalist spirit;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Oakes, 'The Thing That Would Not Die: Notes on Refutation' in H. Lehman/G. Roth eds, ''Weber's Protestant Ethic'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as disputing more generally any inherent or correlative link between Protestantism and capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Elton, p. 312-8&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Postmodernism]] in its repudiation of [[metanarratives]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Appiganesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; has rejected Weber's theory as one (Eurocentric) aspect of such grand tales;&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Fredric Jameson]] sees it as illuminating at least one facet of the bourgeois cultural revolution&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2005) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;—the psycho-sociological transformation that accompanied the move from [[Traditional society|traditional]] [[agrarian society]] to the modern urban world-system.

The '''Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality''' (est. 1976) is an [[Unaccredited institutions of higher education|unaccredited]],&lt;ref name="ed"&gt;[[U.S. Department of Education]] [http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/ "Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs].&lt;/ref&gt; for-profit, degree-granting institution and resource center in the field of [[sexology]] located in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="IASHS_home"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iashs.edu/ |title=Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Sexuality |accessdate=2009-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Degree and certificate programs focus on [[public health]], [[sex therapy]], and sexological research.

The Institute grew out of research in the 1960s highlighting the general lack of understanding of and formal training in human sexuality. The library and archives are a collection of [[Pornographic film|adult films]], academic [[Sexology|sexological]] and erotological resources, and [[sex therapy]] training materials.

The IASHS has trained many of the current directors of sexology programs in other countries. Most recently, a sister school of the IASHS has been launched in China.

Like all post-secondary schools in California, IASHS is required by California law to register with the State of California [[Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education]], an anti-fraud or anti-[[diploma mill]] unit of the [[California Department of Consumer Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bppe.ca.gov/schools/accredited_institutions.shtml|title=Approval by Means of Accreditation Overview|publisher=Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education|accessdate=5 April 2013 |quote=&lt;br&gt;'''Q'''.  Does the Bureau accredit institutions?&lt;br&gt; '''A'''. No. The Bureau approves a person to operate an institution in California. An approval to operate signifies that an institution is in compliance with state standards as set forth in the Private Postsecondary Education Act. Only accrediting agencies can accredit an institution. Accreditation is a voluntary non-governmental review process. On the other hand, state approval is mandatory for a person operating an institution subject to the [[California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 2009]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;   IASHS has BPPE "approval to operate", which means that IASHS meets the minimum legal standards for "offering of ''bona fide'' instruction by qualified faculty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://app.dca.ca.gov/bppe/default.asp|title=Approved Institutions|publisher=Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The path that led to the founding of the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in 1976 began in 1962 with a program called the National Young Adult Project (NYAP). Originating in the then Methodist Church, the NYAP ultimately became an ecumenical project that included the Evangelical United Brethren, Presbyterian Church USA, and United Church of Christ denominations on the national level. Other church bodies (African Methodist Episcopal, American Baptist, Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, Protestant Episcopal, United Presbyterian Church in the USA, and Lutheran Church of America) also participated on a regional or local level. Dr. Ted McIlvenna, a Methodist minister, and cofounder, owner and president of the Institute, headed the San Francisco project for the NYAP. Of the 50+ nationwide projects the NYAP developed by 1968, only the three connected to him and to Glide Memorial Methodist Church had anything to do with sexuality issues. McIlvenna believed that there was a lack of research on human sexuality and the absence of demonstrated effective training and educational methodologies. A meeting in 1967 at the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction|Institute for Sex Research]] led to the formation of the National Sex Forum as part of the [[Glide Foundation]] to address this lack.&lt;ref name="sex_enc1994" /&gt;

By 1974, it was clear to the Forum that a free-standing institute dedicated to the study of and education and training in the emerging field of [[sexology]] was required. They divided the creation of the academic institute as: McIlvenna to re-envision the Forum as an academic setting; Laird Sutton to collect a graphic-resource library; Herbert Vandervoort to organize and prepare the academic work of the study team; and Marguerite Rubenstein, Loretta Haroian, and Phyllis Lyon to define the professional training standards for the new academically trained professional sexologists.&lt;ref name="sex_enc1994"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bullough, Bonnie |author2=Bullough, Vern L. |title=Human sexuality: an encyclopedia |publisher=Garland Pub |location=New York |year=1994 |pages=310&amp;ndash;312 |isbn=0-8240-7972-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wardell Pomeroy]] was the first Academic Dean.&lt;ref name="HirsArch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/CHR07.HTM#kopf |title=Archive for Sexology: Modern Sex Research (1938– ) |accessdate=2009-10-23 |publisher=Magnus Hirschfeld Archive for Sexology at Humboldt University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute was integral to the development of ''[[Humanistic psychology|humanistic sexology]]'', emphasizing experiential techniques and sexual pleasure over positivist empiricism. The culture of casual as well as clinical nudity and the inclusion of various [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]] and [[erotic massage]] techniques led to the Institute being nicknamed "Fuck U" by some critics.&lt;ref name="Irvine2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Irvine, Janice M. |title=Disorders of desire: sexuality and gender in modern American sexology |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=1-59213-151-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of [[Reichian therapy]] and other techniques not well founded in research has similarly led to criticism.&lt;ref name="Irvine2005" /&gt;

== Academics ==
Degrees are offered in Master of Human Sexuality, Master of Public Health in Human Sexuality, and Doctor of Human Sexuality, as well as Doctor of Education and Doctor of Philosophy degrees with a focus in sexology and erotology. They also offer [[Professional certification|professional certificates]] in: Associate in [[Sex Education]], [[Clinical Sexology]], [[Sexological Bodywork]], Sexological Instructor/Advisor of AIDS/[[STI Prevention]], [[Sex Coaching]], and [[Erotology]] Certificates.

Coursework varies by degree sought, but includes formal academic lectures, group-based discussion, video lectures and webinars (which may be undertaken off-site as part of a [[distance education]] program), and hands-on training in therapy and [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]]. Research-based degrees include independent or directed use of the Institute's extensive primary and secondary archives of sexological material.&lt;ref name="Irvine2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="courses"&gt;[http://www.humansexualityeducation.com/courses.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all of the faculty listed on the Institute's website obtained their most advanced degree from the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humansexualityeducation.com/faculty-administration.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==
The Institute is not accredited.&lt;ref name="ed" /&gt; The Institute's FAQ page, in response to the question "Is the Institute an accredited academic institution?", states that the Institute is approved by the [[California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education]] (BPPE).&lt;ref&gt;[https://app.dca.ca.gov/bppe/view-school.asp?schlcode=3800061 Database record for IASHS]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the BPPE is not an [[List of recognized higher education accreditation organizations#United States|accrediting agency]]; the agency's main focus is on identifying [[diploma mills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://finance.boston.com/boston/news/read?GUID=17952325 | work=The Boston Globe | title=More financial news | date=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ftp://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0651-0700/sb_675_cfa_20110428_143825_sen_comm.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the BPPE sent a [http://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/ntc_3800061.pdf Notice to Comply] to IASHS regarding several violations. In early 2016, the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education sent a [http://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation_1516058.pdf Citation: Assessment of Fine and Order of Abatement] to IASHS, for seven violations.

As of September 2014, IASHS is required by [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB1247 CA SB1247] to seek and obtain accreditation.

[[Quackwatch]] identifies the Institute as a "Questionable Organization".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quackwatch.com/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecorg.html&lt;/ref&gt; Students at unaccredited institutions are never eligible for [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]], including [[student loans]], through any government agency. In some states, it can be illegal to use a degree from an unaccredited institution, unless approved by the state licensing agency.&lt;ref name=DM&gt;U.S. Department of Education, [http://www.ed.gov/students/prep/college/diplomamills/accreditation.html Diploma Mills and Accreditation]&lt;/ref&gt;

“We don’t take federal money and that’s why we won’t be accredited by the traditional state agencies. We don’t want to be handcuffed as to what we can provide, say and do. We’ve been approached by accrediting bodies run by Mormons and Roman Catholics that wanted us to change our code of ethics to promote contraception and change our name to reflect ‘family and marriage counseling’ instead of sexuality. We won’t do it,” according to IASHS founder Dr. Ted McIlvenna.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
In addition to its educational and archival mission, the Institute engages in outreach, such as teaching [[sex education]] to underserved teenagers in demographics at high risk for [[Teenage pregnancy|pregnancy]]. Ted McIlvenna, president of the Institute, favors a curriculum focusing on teaching teenagers techniques for "obtaining healthy, respectful relationships with their partners" rather than [[abstinence-only sex education]].&lt;ref name="sex-ed_2002"&gt;{{cite news | first=Phil | last=Busse | title=Birds don't do it, Bees don't do it: Surprise!

Jordania is known for his model of the origins of human [[choral singing]] in the wide context of [[human evolution]] and was one of founders of the [[International Research Centre for Traditional Polyphony]] in Georgia.

Jordania’s academic interests include study of worldwide distribution of choral [[polyphonic]] traditions, origins of [[choral singing]], origins of [[rhythm]], origins of human [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[behaviour]], cross-cultural prevalence of [[stuttering]], [[dyslexia]] and acquisition of [[phonological]] system in children, study of the [[cognitive]] threshold between animal and human cognitive abilities. His primary expertise is Georgian and Caucasian traditional music and vocal polyphony.

==Career==
Jordania was born in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (former [[Soviet Union]]). He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in [[ethnomusicology]] from [[Tbilisi State Conservatory]] in 1978. During 1979–1983 he was elected as the President of the Board of Creative Youth of Tbilisi. In 1982 he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in [[musicology]]–[[ethnomusicology]] from Tbilisi Theatrical Institute, and served as lecturer, senior lecturer, assistant professor, and professor at the Department of Georgian Traditional Music at [[Tbilisi State Conservatory]]. For one year (in 1984) he served as a dean of the Faculty of Musicology. In 1991 he received the title [[D.Mus]] from [[Kiev Conservatory]]. From 1988 until 1995 Jordania was the head of the Musical Sector of the Centre of the Mediterranean Studies at the Tbilisi State University. He published his first monograph on choral polyphony in 1989. In 1984 he was instrumental in organizing the conference "Problems of Folk Polyphony". This conference became the beginning of the series of biannual international conferences (1984, 1986, 1988, 1998, 2000) and symposia (2002, 2004, 2006, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016) on traditional polyphony, and led to establishing the [[International Research Centre for Traditional Polyphony]] at Tbilisi State Conservatory in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doijašvili|first=Manana|title=The Vano Saradjishvili Tbilisi State Conservatoire, 1917-2007|year=2008|publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]]|isbn=1600219101|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWOM8ia2-2wC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22Joseph+Jordania%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-sUhUs-hFfLh4AP8wYHoDQ&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Joseph%20Jordania%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, in recognition of "his contribution to systematic analysis of folk polyphonies of the world, proposing a new model for the origins of traditional choral singing in a broad context of human evolution" Jordania was awarded the [[Fumio Koizumi Prize for ethnomusicology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geidai.ac.jp/labs/koizumi/awarde/21jj1e.html|title=21st Annual (2009) Koizumi Fumio Prize|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Koizumi Fumio Prize|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astrophysics]], the '''Lane–Emden equation''' is a dimensionless form of [[Poisson's equation]] for the gravitational potential of a Newtonian self-gravitating, spherically symmetric, [[polytropic]] fluid. It is named after astrophysicists [[Jonathan Homer Lane]] and [[Robert Emden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lane|first=Jonathan Homer|title=On the Theoretical Temperature of the Sun under the Hypothesis of a Gaseous Mass Maintaining its Volume by its Internal Heat and Depending on the Laws of Gases Known to Terrestrial Experiment|journal=The American Journal of Science and Arts|date=1870|volume=50|series=2|pages=57–74|author-link=Jonathan Homer Lane}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equation reads

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\xi^2} \frac{d}{d\xi} \left({\xi^2 \frac{d\theta}{d\xi}}\right) + \theta^n = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensionless radius and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is related to the density, and thus the pressure, by &lt;math&gt;\rho=\rho_c\theta^n&lt;/math&gt; for central density &lt;math&gt;\rho_c&lt;/math&gt;. The index &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the polytropic index that appears in the polytropic equation of state,

: &lt;math&gt; P = K \rho^{1 + \frac{1}{n}}\, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; are the pressure and density, respectively, and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a constant of proportionality. The standard boundary conditions are &lt;math&gt;\theta(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta'(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;. Solutions thus describe the run of pressure and density with radius and are known as ''polytropes'' of index &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. If an isothermal fluid (polytropic index tends to infinity) is used instead of a polytropic fluid, one obtains the [[Emden–Chandrasekhar equation]].

== Applications ==
Physically, hydrostatic equilibrium connects the gradient of the potential, the density, and the gradient of the pressure, whereas Poisson's equation connects the potential with the density. Thus, if we have a further equation that dictates how the pressure and density vary with respect to one another, we can reach a solution. The particular choice of a polytropic gas as given above makes the mathematical statement of the problem particularly succinct and leads to the Lane–Emden equation. The equation is a useful approximation for self-gravitating spheres of plasma such as stars, but typically it is a rather limiting assumption.

== Derivation ==

=== From hydrostatic equilibrium ===
Consider a self-gravitating, spherically symmetric fluid in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. Mass is conserved and thus described by the [[continuity equation]]

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dm}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a function of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. The equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{Gm}{r^2} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is also a function of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Differentiating again gives

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{dP}{dr}\right) &amp;= \frac{2Gm}{r^3}-\frac{G}{r^2}\frac{dm}{dr} \\
&amp;=-\frac{2}{\rho r}\frac{dP}{dr}-4\pi G\rho
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the continuity equation has been used to replace the mass gradient. Multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;r^2&lt;/math&gt; and collecting the derivatives of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; on the left, one can write

: &lt;math&gt; r^2\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{dP}{dr}\right)+\frac{2r}{\rho}\frac{dP}{dr}
= \frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{r^2}{\rho}\frac{dP}{dr}\right)=-4\pi Gr^2\rho &lt;/math&gt;

Dividing both sides by &lt;math&gt;r^2&lt;/math&gt; yields, in some sense, a dimensional form of the desired equation. If, in addition, we substitute for the polytropic equation of state with &lt;math&gt;P=K\rho_c^{1+\frac{1}{n}}\theta^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho=\rho_c\theta^n&lt;/math&gt;, we have

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2K\rho_c^\frac{1}{n}(n+1)\frac{d\theta}{dr}\right)=-4\pi G\rho_c\theta^n&lt;/math&gt;

Gathering the constants and substituting &lt;math&gt;r=\alpha\xi&lt;/math&gt;, where

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2=(n+1)K\rho_c^{\frac{1}{n}-1}/4\pi G,&lt;/math&gt;

we have the Lane–Emden equation,

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\xi^2} \frac{d}{d\xi} \left({\xi^2 \frac{d\theta}{d\xi}}\right) + \theta^n = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

=== From Poisson's equation ===

Equivalently, one can start with [[Poisson's equation]],

: &lt;math&gt; \nabla^2\Phi=\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left( r^2\frac{d\Phi}{dr} \right) = 4\pi G\rho &lt;/math&gt;

One can replace the gradient of the potential using the hydrostatic equilibrium, via

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\Phi}{dr}= - \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{dP}{dr} &lt;/math&gt;

which again yields the dimensional form of the Lane–Emden equation.

==Exact Solutions==
For a given value of the polytropic index &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, denote the solution to the Lane–Emden equation as &lt;math&gt;\theta_n(\xi)&lt;/math&gt;. In general, the Lane–Emden equation must be solved numerically to find &lt;math&gt;\theta_n&lt;/math&gt;. There are exact, analytic solutions for certain values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, in particular: &lt;math&gt;n = 0,1,5&lt;/math&gt;.  For &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; between 0 and 5, the solutions are continuous and finite in extent, with the radius of the star given by &lt;math&gt;R = \alpha \xi_1 &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta_n(\xi_1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

For a given solution &lt;math&gt;\theta_n&lt;/math&gt;, the density profile is given by

: &lt;math&gt; \rho = \rho_c \theta_n^n &lt;/math&gt;.

The total mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; of the model star can be found by integrating the density over radius, from 0 to &lt;math&gt;\xi_1&lt;/math&gt;.

The pressure can be found using the polytropic equation of state, &lt;math&gt;P = K \rho^{1+\frac{1}{n}} &lt;/math&gt;, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt; P = K \rho_c^{1+\frac{1}{n}} \theta_n^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, if the gas is [[ideal gas law|ideal]], the equation of state is &lt;math&gt;P = k_B\rho T/\mu&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; the mean molecular weight. The temperature profile is then given by

: &lt;math&gt; T = \frac{K\mu}{k_B} \rho_c^{1/n} \theta_n &lt;/math&gt;

In spherically symmetric cases, the Lane–Emden equation is integrable for only three values of the polytropic index &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

=== For ''n'' = 0 ===
If &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt;, the equation becomes

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\xi^2} \frac{d}{d\xi} \left( \xi^2 \frac{d\theta}{d\xi} \right) + 1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Re-arranging and integrating once gives

: &lt;math&gt; \xi^2\frac{d\theta}{d\xi} = C_1-\frac{1}{3}\xi^3 &lt;/math&gt;

Dividing both sides by &lt;math&gt;\xi^2&lt;/math&gt; and integrating again gives

: &lt;math&gt; \theta(\xi)=C_0-\frac{C_1}{\xi}-\frac{1}{6}\xi^2 &lt;/math&gt;

The boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;\theta(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta'(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; imply that the constants of integration are &lt;math&gt;C_0=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_1=0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore,

: &lt;math&gt; \theta(\xi) = 1 - \frac{1}{6}\xi^2&lt;/math&gt;

=== For ''n'' = 1 ===
When &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, the equation can be expanded in the form

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2\theta}{d\xi^2}+\frac{2}{\xi}\frac{d\theta}{d\xi} + \theta = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

One assumes a power series solution:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta(\xi)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n \xi^n &lt;/math&gt;

This leads to a recursive relationship for the expansion coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt; a_{n+2} = -\frac{a_n}{(n+3)(n+2)} &lt;/math&gt;

This relation can be solved leading to the general solution:

: &lt;math&gt; \theta(\xi)=a_0 \frac{\sin\xi}{\xi} + a_1 \frac{\cos\xi}{\xi} &lt;/math&gt;

The boundary condition for a physical polytrope demands that &lt;math&gt; \theta(\xi) \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; \xi \rightarrow 0 &lt;/math&gt;.
This requires that &lt;math&gt; a_0 = 1, a_1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, thus leading to the solution:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta(\xi)=\frac{\sin\xi}{\xi} &lt;/math&gt;

=== For ''n'' = 5 ===
We start from with the Lane–Emden equation:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac1{\xi^2} {\frac{d}{d\xi}} \left(\xi^2\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}\right) + \theta^5 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

====Schuster's integral====

Rewriting for &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\theta}{d\xi} &lt;/math&gt; produces:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\theta} {d\xi} = \frac1 2 \left(1+\frac{\xi^2}{3}\right)^{3/2} \frac{2\xi} 3 = \frac {\xi^3}{3 \left[ 1+\frac {\xi^2} 3 \right]^{3/2}}
 &lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating with respect to ''ξ'' leads to:

: &lt;math&gt; \theta^5 =\frac{\xi^2}{\left[1+\frac{\xi^2}{3}\right]^{3/2}} + \frac{3\xi^2}{9\left[1+\frac{\xi^2}3\right]^{5/2}} = \frac 9 {9\left[1+\frac{\xi^2}3\right]^{5/2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Reduced, we come by:

: &lt;math&gt;
\theta^5 = \frac 1 { \left[ 1+\frac{\xi^2}3 \right]^{5/2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the Lane–Emden equation has the solution

: &lt;math&gt; \theta(\xi)=\frac 1 {\sqrt{1+\xi^2/3}} &lt;/math&gt;

when &lt;math&gt;n=5&lt;/math&gt;. This solution is finite in mass but infinite in radial extent, and therefore the complete polytrope does not represent a physical solution. Chandrasekhar believed for a long time that finding other solution for &lt;math&gt;n=5&lt;/math&gt; "is complicated and involves elliptic integrals".

====Srivastava's solution====
In 1962, Sambhunath Srivastava found an explicit solution when &lt;math&gt;n=5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Srivastava, S. (1962). A New Solution of the Lane-Emden Equation of Index n= 5. The Astrophysical Journal, 136, 680-681.&lt;/ref&gt; His solution is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{\sin(\ln \sqrt \xi)}{\sqrt\xi[3-2 \sin^2 (\ln \sqrt\xi)]},&lt;/math&gt;

and from this solution, a family of solutions &lt;math&gt;\theta(\xi)\rightarrow \sqrt A\, \theta(A\xi)&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained using homology transformation. Since this solution does not satisfy the conditions at the origin (in fact, it is oscillatory with amplitudes growing indefinitely as the origin is approached), this solution can be used in composite stellar models.

== Numerical solutions ==
In general, solutions are found by numerical integration. Many standard methods require that the problem is formulated as a system of first-order [[ordinary differential equation]]s. For example,

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \frac{d\theta}{d\xi}=-\frac{\varphi}{\xi^2} \\[6pt]
&amp; \frac{d\varphi}{d\xi}=\theta^n\xi^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(\xi)&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as the dimensionless mass, defined by &lt;math&gt;m(r)=4\pi\alpha^3\rho_c\varphi(\xi)&lt;/math&gt;. The relevant initial conditions are &lt;math&gt;\varphi(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;. The first equation represents hydrostatic equilibrium and the second represents mass conservation.

== Homologous variables ==

=== Homology-invariant equation ===
It is known that if &lt;math&gt;\theta(\xi)&lt;/math&gt; is a solution of the Lane–Emden equation, then so is &lt;math&gt;C^{2/n+1}\theta(C\xi)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chandrasekhar|first=Subrahmanyan|title=An introduction to the study of stellar structure|date=1939|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago, Ill.|bibcode=1939isss.book.....C|author-link=Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solutions that are related in this way are called ''homologous''; the process that transforms them is ''homology''. If one chooses variables that are invariant to homology, then we can reduce the order of the Lane–Emden equation by one.

A variety of such variables exist. A suitable choice is

: &lt;math&gt;U=\frac{d\log m}{d\log r}=\frac{\xi^3\theta^n} \varphi &lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;V=\frac{d\log P}{d\log r}=(n+1)\frac \varphi {\xi\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

We can differentiate the logarithms of these variables with respect to &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, which gives

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{U}\frac{dU}{d\xi}=\frac 1 \xi (3-n(n+1)^{-1}V-U)&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{V}\frac{dV}{d\xi}=\frac 1 \xi (-1+U+(n+1)^{-1}V)&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, we can divide these two equations to eliminate the dependence on &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, which leaves

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dV}{dU}=-\frac{V}{U}\left(\frac{U+(n+1)^{-1}V-1}{U+n(n+1)^{-1}V-3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This is now a single first-order equation.

=== Topology of the homology-invariant equation ===

The homology-invariant equation can be regarded as the autonomous pair of equations

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{d\log\xi}=-U(U+n(n+1)^{-1}V-3)&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dV}{d\log\xi}=V(U+(n+1)^{-1}V-1).&lt;/math&gt;

The behaviour of solutions to these equations can be determined by linear stability analysis. The critical points of the equation (where &lt;math&gt;dV/d\log\xi=dU/d\log\xi=0&lt;/math&gt;) and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the [[Jacobian matrix]] are tabulated below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horedt|first=Georg P.|title=Topology of the Lane-Emden equation|journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]|date=1987|volume=117|issue=1-2|pages=117–130|bibcode=1987A&amp;A...177..117H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

\begin{array}{|l|l|l|}

=== Lichens and Nitrogen Cycle ===
The [[nitrogen cycle]] is one of the Earth’s biogeochemical cycle that involves the conversion of nitrogen into different chemical forms. The main processes of the nitrogen cycle are the fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. As one of the macronutrients, nitrogen plays an important role in plant growth. Both nitrogen-fixing lichens and non-nitrogen fixing lichens absorb the nitrogen as the one of the nutrient.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seneviratne|first=Gamini|last2=Indrasena|first2=I. K.|date=December 2006|title=Nitrogen fixation in lichens is important for improved rock weathering|journal=Journal of Biosciences|volume=31|issue=5|pages=639–643|issn=0250-5991|pmid=17301502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different environments have different factors that contributes or affect the nitrogen cycle. For example, in the subarctic heath, increase in temperature can cause N2 fixation to increase or decrease based on season while overall climate warming indirectly caused the vegetation change which in turn affected of the N2 fixation process.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lett|first=Signe|last2=Michelsen|first2=Anders|date=2014-06-01|title=Seasonal variation in nitrogen fixation and effects of climate change in a subarctic heath|journal=Plant and Soil|volume=379|issue=1–2|pages=193–204|doi=10.1007/s11104-014-2031-y|issn=0032-079X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lichen]]s are symbiotic organisms that play an important role in the biogeochemical cycle on Earth. Lichen's characteristic, such as strong resistances to factors such as desiccation, ability to grow and breakdown rocks allow lichen to grow in different types of environment including highly nitrogen limited area such as subarctic health.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henriksson|first=Elisabet|last2=Simu|first2=Barbro|date=1971|title=Nitrogen Fixation by Lichens|jstor=3543371|journal=Oikos|volume=22|issue=1|pages=119–121|doi=10.2307/3543371}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it does not occur often, formation of [[akinete]]s (type of cell formed by cyanobacteria which are resistant to cold and desiccation) was observed in N2 fixing lichen.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; Depending on its partner, lichens derive the carbon and nitrogen from algal and cyanobacteria photobionts (which fixes N2 from the air).&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahlman|first=Lena|last2=Näsholm|first2=Torgny|last3=Palmqvist|first3=Kristin|date=2002-02-01|title=Growth, nitrogen uptake, and resource allocation in the two tripartite lichens Nephroma arcticum and Peltigera aphthosa during nitrogen stress|journal=New Phytologist|volume=153|issue=2|pages=307–315|doi=10.1046/j.0028-646X.2001.00321.x|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichen fungi can fix dinitrogen during the day and night, as long the dark period is not too long.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;

=== Nitrogen-Fixing Lichens vs. Non-Nitrogen-Fixing Lichens ===
Both N2-fixing lichens and non-N2-fixing lichens take up nitrogen from the environment as nutrient. Both type of lichen secretes many different organic compounds to absorb minerals from the substrates.

Main difference between N2 fixing lichen and non-N2 fixing lichen is their photosynthetic partner. N2 fixing lichen is partnered with cyanobacteria which can fix N2 from the air while green alga, partner of non N2 fixing lichen, can't perform the same process.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henskens|first=F. L.|last2=Green|first2=T. G.

Some lichens such as Placopsis gelada contain both N2 fixing phototrophs and non N2-fixing phototrophs in which [[Nostoc]] (cyanobacteria, the phototrophic N2 fixer) was dwelling within [[Cephalodium|cephalodia]] (small gall like structure within lichen; contains cyanobacteria symbionts).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In such cases, [[heterocyst]] differentiation was greater in cephalodia when compared to having Nostoc as the primary symbionts in lichens, showing that, in the presence of non N2-fixing phototroph, Nostoc specialize for N2 fixation.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Interaction with Lichen ==
=== Response to Nitrogen and Phosphorus ===
Lichen's response to nutrient enrichment depends on not only on species and environmental factors but also partially on thallus concentrations of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johansson|first=Otilia|last2=Olofsson|first2=Johan|last3=Giesler|first3=Reiner|last4=Palmqvist|first4=Kristin|date=2011-08-01|title=Lichen responses to nitrogen and phosphorus additions can be explained by the different symbiont responses|journal=New Phytologist|volume=191|issue=3|pages=795–805|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03739.x|pmid=21534972|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonium, nitrate and organic nitrogen can be assimilated by lichen along with phosphorus as an important stimulants for [[cyanolichen]]s. Photobiont will become less dependent of fungal nutrient supply when nitrogen deposition increases as it will be able to access its own nitrogen and it will stimulate photobiont, causing it to build up, resulting the increase in photosynthesis which increases carbon input.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; However, for lichens that cannot increase their photobiont growth, nitrogen deposition can be damaging due to higher nitrogen concentration than their biological requirements.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Generally, when a lichenized algal cell is nitrogen limited, the addition of nitrogen caused the growth of algal cells.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Under nitrogen limiting condition, chlorophyll concentration was positively correlated with the growth of algal cells indicating that should the concentration of chlorophyll increases, the photobiont population will also increase.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; As lichens absorb nitrogen through fixation, it will have a very strong negative reaction if the nitrogen availability changes indicating its sensitivity to environmental changes. According to the experiment by Sparrius et al., when nitrogen fertilizer was added into the soil, lichen cover was reduced by ~50%, while the addition of phosphorus showed opposite result.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sparrius|first=Laurens B.|last2=Kooijman|first2=Annemieke M.|last3=Sevink|first3=Jan|date=2013-01-01|title=Response of inland dune vegetation to increased nitrogen and phosphorus levels|journal=Applied Vegetation Science|volume=16|issue=1|pages=40–50|doi=10.1111/j.1654-109X.2012.01206.x|issn=1654-109X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the region such as [[Taiga|boreal forest]], where nitrogen and phosphorus are limiting nutrients and for symbiotic interaction to occur properly, their ratio must be balanced.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; General pollution of climate that is indicated by the concentration of NOx can also affect the growth of lichen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyvärinen|first=M.|last2=Crittenden|first2=P. D.|date=1998-11-01|title=Relationships between atmospheric nitrogen inputs and the vertical nitrogen and phosphorus concentration gradients in the lichen Cladonia portentosa|journal=New Phytologist|volume=140|issue=3|pages=519–530|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1998.00292.x|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to [[bryophyte]] (non-vascular land plant), which is also sensitive to nitrogen fertilizer, lichen showed a much stronger response.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Nitrogen Metabolism ===
There are many different species of lichens and each has its own way of allocating nitrogen. The non N2 fixing lichen invests a large amount of nitrogen into photosynthetic tissue, whereas N2 fixing lichen will invest into the fungal tissue.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; N2-fixing lichen species can only attain a certain amount of nitrogen as the addition of ammonium decreases its rate of N2-fixation, which decreases the amount of nitrogen that is exported into the adjacent [[hypha]]e.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; N2 fixation is energy dependent and very costly for lichens.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Millbank|first=J. W.|last2=Kershaw|first2=K. A.|date=1969-07-01|title=Nitrogen Metabolism in Lichens|journal=New Phytologist|volume=68|issue=3|pages=721–729|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1969.tb06476.x|issn=1469-8137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lichens at the region where nitrogen deposition is high, have a lower uptake of nitrogen in comparison to the Antarctic green algal lichen, which takes up 90% of nitrogen deposition in both [[nitrate]] and [[ammonium]] form.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Some lichen species are able to refrain from assimilating excessive amount of nitrogen in order to maintain a balanced tissue concentration.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Majority of lichen species absorbs more NH4+ than NO3- and the impact of temperature on the rate of fixation is "consonant to the normal enzymatic kinetics of them".&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

=== Effects of Nitrogen Fixation ===
N2 fixing lIchens actively fixes atmospheric nitrogen using the [[Nostoc]], located in the [[Cephalodium|cephalodia]]. Lichens are sensitive to nitrogen availability.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Upon nitrogen fixation, there will be an increase of algal cell growth, chlorophyll concentration, and photobiont population. While costly, in regions where nitrogen availability is low, fixation process is the main way for the lichen to absorb nitrogen which is [[Nutrient|macronutrient]] (essential nutrient).

== Importance ==
=== Ecology ===
Nitrogen, as a macronutrient and a biogeochemical cycle, also affects the ecology. Through the nitrogen cycle, it breaks down into the chemical form that allows plants to absorb as nutrients. There are certain regions in the world that most plants can not live due to harsh environments as well as lack of nutrients such as nitrogen. That means that at in some regions, the biogeochemical cycle (including nitrogen cycle and carbon cycle) is unlikely to run smoothly. Lichen is able to absorb nitrogen is multiple forms from soil, rock, and air, taking a part in carbon cycle at the same time. Even though the only small fraction of lichens have the ability to fix nitrogen, it helps the lichen to spread throughout the world and survive even in the harsh environment.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt;

The industrial nitrogen fertilizer greatly affected the vegetation and agriculture throughout the world, resulting significantly increased the amount of food with better quality, but it has a negative impact on ecology in the long run.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crews|first=T. E|last2=Peoples|first2=M. B|date=2004-05-01|title=Legume versus fertilizer sources of nitrogen: ecological tradeoffs and human needs|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880903003402|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=102|issue=3|pages=279–297|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2003.09.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deposition of nitrogen causes the soil acidification and the nitrogens in the fertilizer are often leached through soil and water, running off the different area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riley|first=W.

=== Rock and Soil ===
Earth's mantle contains non-atmospheric nitrogen in the form of rocks and in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halama|first=Ralf|last2=Bebout|first2=Gray E.|last3=John|first3=Timm|last4=Scambelluri|first4=Marco|date=2014-10-01|title=Nitrogen recycling in subducted mantle rocks and implications for the global nitrogen cycle|journal=International Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=103|issue=7|pages=2081–2099|doi=10.1007/s00531-012-0782-3|issn=1437-3254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weathering of the rocks and stone are normally caused by physical, chemical and biological processes. Plants cannot absorb nitrogen from rocks however, fungi can. Fungi within lichens can extract nutrients from mineral surfaces by secreting organic acids. The organic acids (e.g. phenolic acids) are important in solubilizing nutrients from inorganic substrates.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; A study was conducted to test rock phosphate solubilization by lichen-forming fungi. Bacteria that were attached to biotic or abiotic surfaces stimulate exopolysaccharide synthesis.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; While lichens have the ability to absorb nitrogen from rock, this only accounts for a small portion of the nitrogen cycle compared to the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen as it is more easily available.

=== Effects on Plants/Vegetation ===
Photobiont will become less dependent on fungal nutrient supply when nitrogen deposition increases as it will be able to access its own nitrogen and primary producers' nutrient limit will also be reduced.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Nitrogen is one of the more limiting nutrients and the addition of nitrogen stimulate the photobiont, building up its cell, which subsequently increases its photosynthesis and its carbon input. Multiple nitrogen compounds can be assimilated by lichens, such as NH4+, NO3- and organic nitrogen compounds.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Nitrogen deposition reduces the nutrient limitation of primary production. Increase in nitrogen deposition will allow the photobiont to access its own nitrogen which makes it less fungal dependent but only up to certain point.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Depending on the environmental nitrogen availability, the addition of nitrogen can either increase and decrease the growth of the lichen. If the lichen cannot increase its photobiont growth, high nitrogen uptake may result in a higher concentration than it physiologically requires which will negatively affect the lichen and it's host plant as the other nutrients are too limiting.

Lichen’s response to nutrient enrichment is both species-specific and dependent its environmental factors e.g. nutrient concentration, light availability and water supply.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Nitrogen Stress ==
Lichen is nitrogen sensitive and change in nitrogen availability can affect its health greatly.

Two main nitrogen stress factors for lichens are nitrogen deficiency and high nitrogen deposition.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Both types of nitrogen stress result in the reduction of the rate of thallus expansion in lichen. Nitrogen stressed lichen did not show the significant change in chitin: chlorophyll ratios but ergosterol concentration was showed significant increase indicating a higher load of respiratory.

The [[Haber process|Haber-Bosch process]] is the main industrial procedure for nitrogen fertilizer (ammonia) production today which is used for the agricultural purpose and it is stated that more than 5 billion people owe their existence to it.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; It has increased the food production and the farmers no longer have to sacrifice crop yield for nitrogen application not have to use [[Crop rotation|rotating sequence]].&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; However, nitrogen deposition cause soil acidification as well as nitrogen [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]]. In the long term, use of nitrogen fertilizer causes the soil to acidify which reduce the crop performance due heavy metal toxicity and reduction of other nutrients.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; Leached nitrogen can also travel to other regions via water which will contaminate the water and affect plant biodiversity in the nearby areas such as forest or empty fields where lichens are likely to be present.

According to the experiment, the ammonium toxicity due to nitrogen deposition reduced the vitality of lichen greatly at different regions such as inland dunes, boreal conditions, and Antarctic heaths.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

[[File:Codex Bruchsal 1 01v cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Christ in Majesty]] shown within a mandorla shape in a medieval [[illuminated manuscript]].]]
A '''mandorla''' is an [[aureola]], or frame, usually in the shape of a [[vesica piscis]], which surrounds the figures of Christ and the Virgin Mary in traditional Christian art.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinguished from a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] in that it encircles the entire body, and not just the head. It is commonly used to frame the figure of [[Christ in Majesty]] in early medieval and [[Romanesque art]], as well as [[Byzantine art]] of the same periods.  

==Depictions==
The term ''mandorla'', from the [[Italian language]] name for the "[[almond]]" nut, refers to the usual shape. Sometimes  however, especially in earlier depictions, the mandorla takes circular or elliptical forms. Sometimes, also usually in earlier forms, the mandorla is shown as the intersection of two circles. [[Rhombus|Rhombic]] mandorlas are also sometimes seen.

In [[icon]]s of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the mandorla is used to depict sacred moments which transcend time and space, such as the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] and the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] of Christ and the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]]. These mandorla will often be painted in several concentric patterns of color which grow darker as they come close to the center. This is in keeping with the church's use of [[apophatic theology]], as described by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Dionysius the Areopagite]] and others. As holiness increases, there is no way to depict its brightness except by darkness.

In architectural iconography, the frame of the mandorla is often marked with [[Molding (decorative)|decorative mouldings]]. The interior of the mandorla is usually undecorated, but may contain the symbols [[Alpha and Omega|Α and Ω]] or, less frequently, depictions of a starry sky or clouds.

In a famous romanesque fresco of Christ in Glory at [[Sant Climent de Taüll]], the inscription ''Ego Sum Lux Mundi'' ("I Am the Light of the World") is incorporated in the mandorla design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xtec.es/~jarrimad/medieval/romanico/taull.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] at [[Conques]] has Christ, with a gesture carved in [[romanesque sculpture]], indicate the angels at his feet bearing candlesticks. Six surrounding stars, resembling blossoming flowers, indicate the known planets including the [[Moon]]. Here the symbolism implies Christ as the [[Sun God|Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handinaute.org/roman.img/Conques02.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007071716/http://www.handinaute.org/roman.img/Conques02.jpg |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one special case, at Cervon ([[Nièvre]]), Christ is seated surrounded by eight stars, resembling blossoming flowers.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepage.uvt.nl/~s239062/EDIFICES/cervon/CERVONtim.JPG{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Conques the flowers are six-petalled. At Cervon, where the almond motif is repeated in the rim of the mandorla, they are five-petalled, as are almond flowers—the first flowers to appear at the end of winter, even before the leaves of the almond tree. The symbolism of the nine-branched [[Chanukkiyah]] candelabrum may be relevant. In the 12th century a great school of [[Judaism|Judaic]] thought radiated from [[Narbonne]], coinciding with the origins of the [[Kabbalah]].&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scholem |first=Gershom |authorlink=Gershom Scholem |title=Origins of the Kabbalah |publisher=Princeton Paperback |year=1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dRi8v-j7OMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q |isbn=0-691-07314-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, at Cervon the eight star/flower only is six petalled: the Root of David, the Morningstar, mentioned at the close of [[Book of Revelation]] (22:16).&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160808231625/http://www.romanes.com/Cervon/Saint_Barthelemy_de_Cervon_0011.html&lt;/ref&gt; (In one of the oldest manuscripts of the complete [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], one finds the [[Star of David]] imbedded in an octagon.)

In the symbolism of [[Hildegard of Bingen]] the mandorla refers to the [[Cosmos]].&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22272">In [[music cognition]] and [[musical analysis]], the study of '''melodic expectation''' considers the engagement of the brain's predictive mechanisms in response to music.&lt;ref name="Margulis2007"/&gt; For example, if the ascending musical partial [[octave]] "do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-..." is heard, listeners familiar with Western music will have a strong expectation to hear or provide one more note, "do", to complete the octave.

Melodic expectation can be considered at the [[Esthesic and poietic|esthesic level]],&lt;ref name="Nattiez1990"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jean-Jacques Nattiez | publisher  =Princeton University Press  |date= 1992 |title=Music and Discourse: Toward a Semiology of Music (Musicologie générale et sémiologie), translated by Carolyn Abbate | isbn=978-0-691-02714-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which case the focus lies on the listener and its response to music.&lt;ref name="Margulis2007"/&gt; It can be considered at the [[neutral level]],&lt;ref name="Nattiez1990"/&gt; in which case the focus switches to the actual musical content, such as the "printed notes themselves".&lt;ref name="EN1992"/&gt; At the neutral level, the observer may consider logical implications projected onto future elements by past elements&lt;ref name="EN1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "SC5"/&gt; or derive statistical observations from [[information theory]].&lt;ref name="Youngblood1958"/&gt;

==A multifaceted concept==

The notion of melodic expectation has prompted the existence of a corpus of studies in which authors often choose to provide their own terminology in place of using the literature's.&lt;ref name = "SC5"/&gt; This results in an important number of different terms that all point towards the phenomenon of musical expectation:&lt;ref name = "SC5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MMF2006"&gt;{{cite web |author=Morwaread M.

Expectation can also be found mentioned in relation to concepts originating from the field of [[information theory]] such as [[entropy]].&lt;ref name="Youngblood1958"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer1957"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abdallah2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hiller1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knopoff1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Margulis2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Snyder1990"/&gt;
Hybridization of information theory and humanities results in the birth of yet other notions, particularly variations upon the notion of entropy modified for the need of description of musical content.&lt;ref name="Culpepper2010"&gt;{{cite web |author=Sarah E. Culpepper | publisher  =The University of Iowa  |date= | url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1844&amp;context=etd |title=  Musical time and information theory entropy, submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master of Arts degree in Music in the Graduate College of The University of Iowa| accessdate=2014-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consideration of musical expectation can be sorted into four trends.&lt;ref name = "SC5"/&gt;

* A first trend may include publications written in the 1950s by Meyer, Younblood and Krahenbuehl &amp; Coons that are concerned with objectivization and rationalization of the concepts of arousal, uncertainty, or non-confirmation of a prediction using information theory.&lt;ref name="Youngblood1958"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer1957"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krahenbuehl1959"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=David Krahenbuehl  |author2=Edgar Coons  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher  =Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, XVII/4   |date=1959 |title= Information as a measure of experience in music|jstor=428224  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A second trend may concern the more recent publications that include a step-by-step music analysis process at the neutral level, such as the [[generative theory of tonal music]]&lt;ref name="GTTM"/&gt; and Narmour's [[Implication-Realization]] model.&lt;ref name="EN1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EN1990"/&gt;
* A third trend may provide quantitative models based on computer algorithms, such as Margulis' model of melodic expectation or Farbood's model of musical tension.&lt;ref name="MMF2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EHM2005"/&gt;
* A fourth trend may group generalist theories whose focus lies neither in step-by-step processes nor in quantitative operations, and may include elements pertinent to the esthesic level such as cognition and neurophysiology. This includes Larson's "musical forces"&lt;ref name="Larson2005"/&gt; and Huron's theory of general expectation.&lt;ref name="Huron2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Huron | publisher  =M.I.T. Press  |date=2006  |title=Sweet anticipation: music and the psychology of expectation | isbn= 9780262582780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leonard Meyer ==

[[Leonard B. Meyer|Leonard Meyer]]'s ''Emotion and Meaning in Music''&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonard B. Meyer | publisher  = Chicago University Press |date=1956 | title= Emotion and Meaning in Music |isbn=978-0-226-52139-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the classic text in music expectation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Meyer's starting point is the belief that the experience of music (as a listener) is derived from one's emotions and feelings about the music, which themselves are a function of relationships within the music itself.  Meyer writes that listeners bring with them a vast body of musical experiences that, as one listens to a piece, conditions one's response to that piece as it unfolds.  Meyer argued that music's evocative power derives from its capacity to generate, suspend, prolongate, or violate these expectations.

Meyer models listener expectation in two levels.  On a perceptual level, Meyer draws on [[Gestalt psychology]] to explain how listeners build mental representations of auditory phenomena.  Above this raw perceptual level, Meyer argues that learning shapes (and re-shapes) one's expectations over time.

{{main|Implication-Realization}}
Narmour's (1992) Implication-Realization (I-R) Model is a detailed formalization based on Meyer's work on expectation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} A fundamental difference between Narmour's models and most theories of expectation lies in the author's conviction according to which a genuine theory should be formulated in falsifiable terms. According to Narmour, prior knowledge of musical expectation is based too heavily upon percepts, introspection and internalization, which bring insoluble epistemological problems.&lt;ref name="EN1992"/&gt; The theory focuses on how ''implicative intervals'' set up expectations for certain ''realizations'' to follow. The [[Implication-Realization|I-R]] model includes two primary factors: proximity and direction.&lt;ref name="EN1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EN1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EGS1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author=E.

* while Narmour's two fundamental hypotheses address the relations between three elements,&lt;ref name="EN1990"/&gt; the fundamental hypotheses leading to the S&amp;C model address the relations between four elements. Therefore, it can be considered as more directly suited to the classical ''sentence'' and ''period'' forms,&lt;ref name="Caplin"&gt;{{cite book|author=William E. Caplin | publisher  = Oxford University Press |date=1998 | title= Classical Form: A Theory of Formal Functions for the Instrumental Music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven |isbn=978-0195143997}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to popular music forms;&lt;ref name = "SC5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SC2"/&gt;

* the S&amp;C model may encompass all aspects of the musical language, not only the melodic structure.&lt;ref name="SC5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SC2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SC3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SC4"/&gt;

== Margulis's model of melodic expectation ==

Margulis's 2005 model&lt;ref name="EHM2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Elizabeth H. Margulis |date=2005 | title= A model of melodic expectation | journal  = Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=663–714 | doi  = 10.1525/mp.2005.22.4.663 }}&lt;/ref&gt; further extends the I-R model.  First, Margulis added a melodic attraction factor, from some of Lerdahl's work.  Second, while the I-R model relies on a single (local) interval to establish an implication (an expectation), Margulis attempts to model intervalic (local) expectation as well as more deeply schematic (global) expectation.  For this, Margulis relies on Lerdahl's and Jackendoff's GTTM&lt;ref name="GTTM"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fred Lerdhal  |author2=Ray Jackendoff  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher  = MIT Press |date=1983 | title= A Generative Theory of Tonal Music |isbn=978-0-262-62107-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a time-span reduction.  At each hierarchical level (a different time scale) in the reduction, Margulis applies her model.  These separate levels of analysis are combined through averaging, with each level weighted according to values derived from the time-span reduction.  Finally, Margulis's model is explicit and realizable, and yields quantitative output. The output - melodic expectation at each time instant - is a single function of time.

Margulis's model describes three distinct types of listener reactions, each derived from listener-experienced ''tension'':
*Surprise-Tension: inversely proportional to degree of expectancy; results in intensity or dynamism.
*Denial-Tension: proportional to the discrepancy between the expectancy of the most expected event and the expectancy of the actually perceived event; results in desire, drive, will.
*Expectancy-Tension: proportional to the degree of expectancy of the most expected event (in other words, if the listener had no idea what to expect next, the expectancy-tension would be low); results in strain or yearning.&lt;ref name="MMF2006"/&gt;

The '''Museu da Imagem e do Som do Rio de Janeiro''' (in [[English language|English]], '''Rio de Janeiro Museum of Image and Sound''') was inaugurated on September 3, 1965, as part of celebrations of the fourth centenary of the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The '''MIS''' is a museum of the Secretary of Culture of the state of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] dedicated to ''[[carioca]]'' culture.

The institution has launched a pioneering gender audiovisual museum, which would be followed in other Brazilian cities. In addition to having qualified as music and picture documentation center, it was also a cultural center of avant-garde in the 1960s and 1970s, a place of meetings and launching new ideas and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museusdorio.com.br/joomla/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=144:funda%C3%A7%C3%A3o-museu-da-imagem-e-do-som-do-rio-de-janeiro|title=Fundação Museu da Imagem e do Som do Rio de Janeiro

== History ==
In addition to the safekeeping and preservation of the collections, the MIS produces its own collection by collecting testimonies for posterity, project conceived in 1966 as a way to legitimize the action of the museum in the cultural milieu of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Currently, the museum has a collection of more than 900 interviews with approximately four thousand hours of recording covering the various segments of culture. The MIS is not restricted to guard remaining objects from the past, but it is up to date with the present and facing the future. Records and preserves the memory by making use of technologies available each season. The museum, which currently has its collections split between two locations – one in Praça XV (Centro) and the other in [[Lapa, Rio de Janeiro|Lapa]] – is seen as an important part of Rio’s cultural heritage.

== New Museu da Imagem e do Som ==
[[File:Novo Museu da Imagem e do Som do Rio de Janeiro (2014).jpg|thumb|250px|Facade of the new museum in June 2014.]]
The plans for the new MIS are ambitious and building costs are said to be in the region of [[R$]]70 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0,,MUL1453733-5606,00.html|title=Museu da Imagem e do Som terá boate no lugar da Help

The new headquarters of the Museum of Image and Sound will celebrate the culture and musical history of [[Rio de Janeiro]] throughout its eight floors. The first floor of the building will be dedicated to humor and irreverence Rio, while the second floor will tell the history of music in the city, including [[samba]] and [[choro]]. The third floor will honor Brazilian television as well as [[Carmen Miranda]], incorporating the entire museum collection dedicated to the singer, currently located at [[Flamengo Park|Parque do Flamengo]]. In other floors, visitors circulate through images of the urban evolution of the city. The museum's basement will house a multipurpose room, and the terrace receive outdoor cinema sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-real-estate/mis-museum-in-copacabana-is-delayed-again/#|title=MIS Museum in Copacabana is Delayed Again|publisher=riotimesonline.com/|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new headquarters of the museum is an achievement of the Government of Rio de Janeiro, through the Secretary of State for Culture, with the support of the Secretary of State for Works/Public Works Company (EMOP), made in partnership with the [[Roberto Marinho |Roberto Marinho Foundation]].

The project has direct investment of the Government of Rio de Janeiro, through its own resources and of the State Law of Cultural Incentive, and financing of the Tourism Development Program (PRODETUR) and Investment Support United (PROINVEST). The project also includes [[Rede Globo]], [[Itaú]] and [[Natura]] as patrons and sponsored by [[Vale (mining company)|Vale]], [[IBM]], [[AmBev]] and [[Light S.A.|Light]], the support of the [[Votorantim Group]], NHJ of Brazil and the [[Ministry of Culture (Brazil)|Ministry of Culture]], through the Federal Law of Cultural Incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2014/04/no-ultimo-dia-do-cargo-cabral-visita-obras-do-museu-da-imagem-e-do-som.html|title=No último dia do cargo, Cabral visita obras do Museu da Imagem e do Som|publisher=[[Globo.com]]|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/rio/novo-museu-da-imagem-do-som-comeca-surgir-na-paisagem-de-copacabana-12756395|title=Novo Museu da Imagem e do Som começa a surgir na paisagem de Copacabana|publisher=[[O Globo]]|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NK-92®️, a proprietary immortal cell line owned and controlled by [https://NantKwest.com NantKwest, Inc]., is a continuously growing cell line that has features and characteristics of natural killer (NK) cells that every person has circulating in the blood.  Blood NK cells and NK-92®️ cells recognize "invaders" such as viruses and fungus. Most importantly, NK-92®️ cells, like blood NK cells, can attack cancer cells as long as the tumor has not grown out of control. NK-92®️ cells were isolated and characterized by the laboratory of Dr. H. Klingemann - at that time at the British Columbia Cancer Agency in Vancouver, Canada.[1] The cells came from a patient who had a NK cell lymphoma, a rare lymphoma type. Although several other NK cell lines have been cloned, only NK-92®️ cells can be expanded to larger numbers and consistently kill tumor cells vigorously.[2] When NK-92®️ cells bind to a cancer or infected cell, they secrete perforinwhich punches holes in target cells followed by release of granzymes which induce apoptosis in the target cells. NK-92®️ cells also attack cancer cells through the Fas-Fas Ligand system and are capable of producing cytokines that by themselves can kill cancer cells (such as TNF-alpha) or stimulate and expand other immune cells such as interferon.[3] 

== NK-92®️ Cell Line Licensing and Rights ==

The cell line has been licensed to [https://nantKwest.com/ NantKwest], Inc. and is currently being developed in the clinic: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For intravenous therapy in hematological malignancies and solid tumors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For local intra-tumor injection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As effector cells for antibody-mediated killing via CD16 modified cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As effector cells for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific killing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
NK-92®️ cells is a registered trademark of [https://nantkwest.com/ NantKwest, Inc.] in the United States and is pending in Europe.

The cell line has been licensed for non-clinical applications to [http://brinkbiologics.com/ Brink Biologics Inc.] and has been licensing for veterinary applications to Coneksis, Inc.

NantKwest's only authorized distributor for all requestors is [https://brinkbiologics.com Brink Biologics Inc.], which makes NK-92®️ cells and certain genetically-modified variants available for a wide-range of laboratory assays and in vivo research, including ADCC assays that quantify the contribution of ADCC in the therapeutic effect of monoclonal antibodies (Brink Biologics’ Neukopanel) and for other non-clinical assay applications.
==NK-92&lt;sup&gt;®️&lt;/sup&gt; Cells in Clinical Trials==
Three phase I clinical trials, led by experts in adoptive immunotherapy of cancer, have so far yielded excellent results.  Hans Klingemann, MD, PhD and Sally Arai, MD completed the US trial at [[Rush University Medical Center]] ([[Chicago]]) in renal cell and melanoma patients,&lt;ref&gt;Arai S, Meagher R, Swearingen M, et al. Infusion of the allogeneic cell line NK-92®️ in patients with advanced [[renal cell]] cancer or [[melanoma]]: a phase I trial. Cytotherapy 2008;10:625-32&lt;/ref&gt; and Torsten Tonn, MD and Oliver Ottmann, MD completed the European trial at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] in patients with various solid and hematological malignancies.&lt;ref&gt;Tonn T, Becker S, Esser R, Schwabe D, Seifried E. Cellular immunotherapy of malignancies using the clonal natural killer cell line NK-92®️. J Hematother Stem Cell Res 2001;10:535-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Armand Keating, MD is completing the last cohort of patients in the Canadian trial at [[Princess Margaret Cancer Centre|Princess Margaret Hospital]] in [[Toronto]] in [[lymphoma]] patients after autologous bone marrow transplants. In all three programs, NK-92®️ cells were administered as a simple intravenous infusion, dosed two or three times per treatment course and given in the outpatient setting.

Most importantly, there were no grade ≥ 2 side-effects during or after the short infusion of NK-92®️ cells. The maximum dose given in the Frankfurt trial was 10e10 cells/me2 x 2 infusions, each 48 hours apart. The Chicago study infused NK-92®️ cells at a maximum of 5 x 10e cells/me2 x 3 infusions, each 48 hours apart. This was not the MTD but rather the number of cells that could be expanded in culture bags over a three-week culture period. Alternative cell expansion technologies (bioreactors) will make it possible to further expand the numbers of NK-92®️ cells on a smaller 'footprint'.   Anecdotal reports of antitumor activity in the two completed phase I studies have been observed in 6/11 patients with renal cancer, 3/4 patients with lung cancer, and 1/1 patient with melanoma, all with very advanced disease. In addition to disease stabilization and regression of metastases in lung and [[lymph node]]s, the severe pain associated with tumor metastases in several patients, which had been refractory to standard chemotherapy, was remarkably lessened.  The ongoing trial in Toronto treats patients with lymphoma who have relapsed after an autologous stem cell transplant. Preliminary results suggest a significant benefit in several patients.

== Genetic Engineering of NK-92&lt;sup&gt;®️&lt;/sup&gt; Cells ==
NK-92®️ cells  can be genetically engineered to recognize and kill human cancer cells. 
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) engineered [[T-lymphocyte]]s are currently the buzz in Immuno-Oncology, having shown that infusion of those engineered cells can achieve remissions in some patients with [[acute leukemia|acute]] and [[chronic leukemia]].&lt;ref name="pmid21830940"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Porter DL, Levine BL, Kalos M, Bagg A, June CH |title=Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells in chronic lymphoid leukemia |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=365 |issue=8 |pages=725–33 | date=August  2011 |pmid=21830940 |pmc=3387277 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1103849 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, NK cells (either from peripheral blood or cord blood) have not generated sufficient interest as CAR{{nbhyph}}engineered cytotoxic effector cells, largely for two reasons: the extent of NK cell expansion can be  dependent on the donor; secondly, transfection efficiency, even with lentiviral or retroviral vectors is only moderately efficient. NK-92®️ cells on the other hand, have predictable expansion kinetics and can be grown in bioreactors to billions of cells within a couple of weeks. They can easily be transfected either with viral supernatant or physical methods. Even [[mRNA]] can be shuttled into the cells with high efficiency. Since no integration of mRNA into the genome occurs, this transfection is less risky and  the regulatory burden is equally reduced.

NK-92®️ cells have also been transfected with a high affinity Fc Receptor (NK-92Fc) which is the main receptor for monoclonal antibodies to execute antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicty (ADCC) - examples: rituximab, ofatumumab. Based on this variant, an assay has been developed to quantify the ADCC of monoclonal antibodies (Neukopanel),&lt;ref name="pmid19562616"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weitzman J, Betancur M, Boissel L, Rabinowitz AP, Klein A, Klingemann H |title=Variable contribution of monoclonal antibodies to ADCC in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia |journal=Leuk.

In manufacturing industry, '''Nesting''' refers to the process of laying out cutting patterns to minimize the [[raw material]] waste. Examples include manufacturing parts from flat raw material such as [[sheet metal]].

Such efforts can also be applied to additive manufacturing, such as [[3D printing]]. Here the advantages sought can include minimizing tool movement that is not producing product, or maximizing how many pieces can be fabricated in one build season. One difference from nesting of cut pieces is that 3D parts often have a cross section that changes with height, which can cause interference between adjacent parts as they are built up.

==Process==
To minimize the amount of [[scrap]] raw material produced during cutting, companies use proprietary nesting [[software]]. The software analyses the parts (shapes) to be produced at a particular time. Using  [[algorithm]]s, it then determines how to lay these parts out in such a way as to produce the required quantities of parts, while minimizing the amount of raw material wasted. Off-the-shelf nesting software packages address the optimization needs. While some cater only to rectangular nesting, others offer profile or shape nesting where the parts required can be any odd shape. These irregular parts can be created using popular [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) tools. Most of the profile nesting software can read IGES or DXF profile files automatically, a few of them work with built-in converters. An important consideration in shape nesting is to verify that the software in question actually performs true profile nesting and not just block nesting. In block nesting an imaginary rectangle is drawn around the shape and then the rectangles are laid side-by side which actually is not profile nesting. There remains scope for waste reduction.

Nesting software must take into account the limitations and features of the [[machining]] technology in use, such as: &lt;ref&gt;https://www.sigmanest.com/2017/02/choosing-the-right-nesting-engine/&lt;/ref&gt;

* Machining cannot take place where the raw material is clamped into place;
* Some machines can access only half of the material at a particular time; the machine automatically flips the sheet over to allow the remaining half to be accessed;
* When punching, the width of the punch tool must be considered;
* Shearing may be permitted only in certain areas of the sheet due to limitations of the machinery;


Nesting software may also have to take into account material characteristics, such as: &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sigmanest.com/images/pdfs/AutoNEST_NoSh.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://files.jetcam.net/pdf/expert_new.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

* Defects on material that must be discarded;
* Different quality areas that must match corresponding quality levels required for different parts;
* Direction constraints, that may come from a printed pattern or from fiber direction;

Many machine manufacturers offer their own custom nesting software designed to offer ease of use and take full advantage of the features of their specific machines.

If a fabricator operates machines from more than one vendor, they may prefer to use an [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] nesting package from a third-party vendor. They then have the potential to run jobs on any available machine, and their staff should not have to learn several different software packages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5180">{{Distinguish | De Oratore}}
'''''Orator''''' was written by [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] in the latter part of the year 46 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Tempest, Kathryn. "Prologue." In Cicero: politics and persuasion in ancient Rome. London: Continuum, 2011. 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; It is his last work on [[rhetoric]], three years before his death.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson"&gt;Cicero, Marcus Tullius, and George L. Hendrickson. Brutus Orator / Cicero. With an English transl. by H.M. Hubbell.. Rev. and repr. ed. London: Heinemann [u.a.], 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing rhetoric, Cicero addresses previous comments on the five canons of rhetoric: [[Inventio]], [[Dispositio]], [[Elocutio]], [[Memoria]], and [[Pronuntiatio]]. In this text, Cicero attempts to describe the perfect orator, in response to [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]]’ request. ''Orator'' is the continuation of a debate between [[Brutus]] and [[Cicero]], which originated in his text ''[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]'', written earlier in the same year. 

The oldest partial text of ''Orator'' was recovered in the monastery of [[Mont Saint-Michel]] and now is located in the library at [[Avranches]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, G. L. . "Cicero's Correspondence with Brutus and Calvus on Oratorical 	Style ." ''The American Journal of Philology'' 47, no. 3 (1926): 237-238.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-seven existing manuscripts have been discovered from this text. Another complete text was discovered in 1421, near [[Milan]] in the town of [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]]. These two texts vary considerably between the two manuscripts and modern translators rely on both. 

In 46. B.C, when Cicero wrote ''Orator'', many young Roman men revolted against the stylistic paradigms put forward by Cicero, and from most Roman traditions in general.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson" /&gt; Cicero writes in a defensive posture to this hostile audience.

==Context and summary==
In ''Orator'', Cicero depicts several models for speakers. Cicero states to the Romans the importance of searching and discovering their own sense of [[rhetoric]]. “I am sure, the magnificence of [[Plato]] did not deter [[Aristotle]] from writing, nor did [[Aristotle]] with all his marvelous breadth of knowledge put an end to the studies of others” &lt;ref name= "Cicero"&gt;Cicero, Marcus Tullius, and B White. Cicero's Brutus, or history of famous orators: 	also, his Orator, or accomplished speaker. Now first translated into English, by E. Jones. London: Printed for B. White, 1776.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero encouraged the [[plebeians]] through his writing, “Moreover, not only were outstanding men not deterred from undertaking [[Liberal arts education|liberal]] pursuits, but even craftsmen did not give up their arts because they were unable to equal the beauty of the picture of Ialysus . . . .”&lt;ref name= "Cicero" /&gt; Cicero proposes that rhetoric cannot be confined to one specific group but rather outlines a guide that will lead to the creation of successful orators across Roman society.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson" /&gt;

In ''Orator'', Cicero also addressed the accusation lodged by his fellow senators, including [[Brutus]], that he was an “[[Atticism|Atticist]].” Cicero addresses this claim by saying that he is too independent and bold to be associated with [[Atticism]], producing his own unique style. Cicero claims the perfect orator creates his own “[[elocutio]],” or diction and style, rather than following this movement.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson" /&gt;
	Cicero states that all five canons are equally important. Throughout the text, Cicero advises his Roman audience on how to form proper oratory by formal guidelines but also how to specialize in individually in their own sense of oratory. ''Orator'' is written with ideas ranging from the construction of arguments to rhetorical performance. In relation to other Ciceronian works on rhetoric, Orator receives less treatment with scarce research compared to other rhetorical works.

==Goals of the Orator==
The three aims of the orator, according to Cicero, are "''docere, delectare, et movere''."  That is: to prove your thesis to the audience, to delight the audience, and to emotionally move the audience.&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Donald|title=Rhetoric and Poetry in the Renaissance|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10140/10140-h/10140-h.htm|publisher=Distributed Proofreaders|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional vividness of poetic language becomes part of the rhetorical tools in service of persuading the audience to your point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cicero|first=Marcus Tullius|title=Orator|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/orator.shtml#69|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62612">'''Perceptual control theory''' ('''PCT''') is a model of [[behavior]] based on the principles of [[negative feedback]], but differing in important respects from [[Control theory|engineering control theory]]. Results of PCT experiments have demonstrated that an organism controls neither its own behavior, nor external environmental variables, but rather its own perceptions of those variables. Actions are not controlled, they are varied so as to cancel the effects that unpredictable environmental disturbances would otherwise have on controlled perceptions. As a catch-phrase of the field puts it, "behavior is the control of perception." PCT demonstrates circular causation in a negative feedback loop closed through the environment. This fundamentally contradicts the classical notion of linear causation of behavior by stimuli, in which environmental stimuli are thought to cause behavioral responses, mediated (according to [[cognitive psychology]]) by intervening cognitive processes.  &lt;sup&gt;[[citation needed]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Numerous computer simulations of specific behavioral situations demonstrate its efficacy,&lt;ref&gt;For example in [http://mindreadings.com/demos.htm this collection].&lt;/ref&gt; with extremely high correlations to observational data (0.95 or better), which are vanishingly rare in the so-called 'soft' sciences.&lt;ref name=Runkel.cast/&gt; While the adoption of PCT in the scientific community has not been widespread, it has been applied not only in [[experimental psychology]] and [[neuroscience]], but also in sociology, linguistics, and a number of other fields, and has led to a method of psychotherapy called the [[method of levels]].

==The place of purpose (intention) and causation in psychology==

A tradition from Aristotle through William James recognizes that behavior is ''purposeful'' rather than merely reactive. However, the only evidence for intentions was subjective. Behaviorists following [[Wilhelm Wundt|Wundt]], [[Edward Thorndike|Thorndyke]], [[John B. Watson|Watson]], and others rejected introspective reports as data for an objective science of psychology. Only observable behavior could be admitted as data.&lt;ref&gt;"The behaviorist asks: Why don't we make what we can observe the real field of psychology? Let us limit ourselves to things that can be observed, and formulate laws concerning only those things. Now what can we observe? We can observe behavior—what the organism does or says." Watson, J.B. (1924). ''Behaviorism''. New York: People's Institute Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

There follows from this stance the assumption that environmental events (stimuli) cause behavioral actions (responses). This assumption persists in [[cognitive psychology]], which interposes [[cognitive maps]] and other postulated [[information processing]] between stimulus and response, but otherwise retains the assumption of linear causation from environment to behavior.&lt;ref name=Marken2009rev&gt;{{cite journal | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | author-link = | title =You say you had a revolution: Methodological foundations of closed-loop psychology | journal =Review of General Psychology | volume =13 | issue =2 | pages =137–145 | publisher = | location = | date =June 2009 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi =10.1037/a0015106 | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, more specific reason for psychologists' rejecting notions of purpose or intention was that they could not see how a goal (a state that did not yet exist) could cause the behavior that led to it. PCT resolves these philosophical arguments about [[teleology]] because it provides a model of the functioning of organisms in which purpose has objective status without recourse to [[introspection]], and in which causation is circular around [[feedback loops]].&lt;ref name=Runkel-PLT&gt;{{cite book | last =Runkel | first =Philip J. | author-link = | title =People as living things | publisher =Living Control Systems Publishing | edition = | date =2003 | location =Hayward, CA | pages =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0-9740155-0-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

PCT has roots in insights of [[Claude Bernard]] and 20th century [[control systems engineering]] and [[cybernetics]]. It was originated as such, and given its present form and experimental methodology, by [[William T. Powers]].&lt;ref name=Runkel.cast&gt;{{cite book | last =Runkel | first =Philip J. | author-link = | title =Casting nets and testing specimens: Two grand methods of psychology | publisher =Praeger | edition = | date =1990 | location =New York | page =103 | isbn =0-275-93533-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cziko.TWD&gt;{{Citation | last =Cziko | first =Gary | author-link = | title =The things we do: Using the lessons of Bernard and Darwin to understand the what, how, and why of our behavior | place =Cambridge, MA | publisher =MIT Press | year =2000 | page =9 | isbn =0-262-03277-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powers recognized that to be purposeful implies control, and that the concepts and methods of engineered control systems could be applied to biological control systems. A key insight is that the variable that is controlled is not the output of the system (the behavioral actions), but its input, that is, a sensed and transformed function of some state of the environment that could be affected by the control system's output. Because some of these sensed and transformed inputs appear as consciously perceived aspects of the environment, Powers labelled the controlled variable "perception". The theory came to be known as "Perceptual Control Theory" or PCT rather than "Control Theory Applied to Psychology" because control theorists often assert or assume that it is the system's output that is controlled.&lt;ref name=Astrom&gt;{{cite book | last =Astrom | first =Karl J. | last2 =Murray | first2 =Richard M. | title =Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers | publisher =Princeton University Press | series = | volume = | edition = | date =2008 | location = | pages = | language = | url =http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/AM08/pdf/am08-complete_28Sep12.pdf | doi = | id = | isbn =0-691-13576-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In PCT it is the internal representation of the state of some variable in the environment—a "perception" in everyday language—that is controlled.&lt;ref&gt;For additional information about the history of PCT, see interviews with William T. Powers in the "Audio" section under "External links".&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principles of PCT were first published by Powers, Clark, and MacFarland as a "general feedback theory of behavior" in 1960,&lt;ref name=PCM1960&gt;{{cite journal | last =Powers | first =William T. | last2 =Clark | first2 =R.K. | last3 =McFarland | first3 =R.L. | title =A general feedback theory of human behavior (Part I) | journal =Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume =11 | issue =1 | pages =71–88 | publisher = | location = | date =1960 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.2466/pms.1960.11.1.71| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }} and {{cite journal | last =Powers | first =William T. | last2 =Clark | first2 =R.K. | last3 =McFarland | first3 =R.L. | title =A general feedback theory of human behavior (Part II) | journal =Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume =11 | issue =3 | pages =309–323 | publisher = | location = | date =1960 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.2466/pms.1960.11.3.309| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }} [Reprinted in {{citation | last =Bertalanffy | first =Ludwig von | last2 =Rapoport | first2 =Anatol | title =General Systems: Yearbook of the Society for General Systems Research | place =Ann Arbor, Michigan | publisher =Society for General Systems Research | series = | volume =5 | orig-year =1960 | year = | month= | edition = | chapter = | chapter-url = | page = | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }},  pages 63-73, 75-83.

==Example==

A simple negative feedback control system is a [[cruise control]] system for a car. A cruise control system has a sensor which "perceives" speed as the rate of spin of the drive shaft directly connected to the wheels. It also has a driver-adjustable 'goal' specifying a particular speed. The sensed speed is continuously compared against the specified speed by a device (called a "comparator") which subtracts the currently sensed input value from the stored goal value. The difference (the error signal) determines the throttle setting (the accelerator depression), so that the engine output is continuously varied to prevent the speed of the car from increasing or decreasing from that desired speed as environmental conditions change. This type of classical negative feedback control was worked out by engineers in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="black93"&gt;Harold Black and the Negative-Feedback Amplifier, Ronald Kline, IEEE Control Systems, Aug 1993, Volume 13, Issue 4, Pages 82-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite journal | last =Bennett | first =Stuart | author-link = | title =A brief history of automatic control | journal =IEEE Control Systems Magazine | volume =16 | issue =3 | pages =17–25 | publisher = | location = | date =June 1996 | language = | url =http://ieeecss.org/CSM/library/1996/june1996/02-HistoryofAutoCtrl.pdf | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.1109/37.506394| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = 18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the speed of the car starts to drop below the goal-speed, for example when climbing a hill, the small increase in the error signal, amplified, causes engine output to increase, which keeps the error very nearly at zero. If the speed begins to exceed the goal, e.g. when going down a hill, the engine is throttled back so as to act as a brake, so again the speed is kept from departing more than a barely detectable amount from the goal speed (brakes being needed only if the hill is too steep). The result is that the cruise control system maintains a speed close to the goal as the car goes up and down hills, and as other disturbances such as wind affect the car's speed. This is all done without any planning of specific actions, and without any blind reactions to stimuli. Indeed, the cruise control system does not sense disturbances such as wind pressure at all, it only senses the controlled variable, speed. Nor does it control the power generated by the engine, it uses the 'behavior' of engine power as its means to control the sensed speed.

The same principles of negative feedback control (including the ability to nullify effects of unpredictable external or internal disturbances) apply to living control systems.&lt;ref name=Wiener48/&gt; The thesis of PCT is that animals and people do not control their behavior; rather, they vary their behavior as their means for controlling their perceptions, with or without external disturbances. This directly contradicts the historical and still widespread assumption that behavior is the final result of stimulus inputs and cognitive plans.&lt;ref name=Marken2009rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Miller| first =George |author2=Galanter, Eugene |author3=Pribram, Karl| title =Plans and the structure of behavior| publisher =[[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]| year =1960| location =[[New York City|New York]]| isbn=0-03-010075-5  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The methodology of modeling, and PCT as model==

The principal datum in PCT methodology is the controlled variable. The fundamental step of PCT research, the test for controlled variables, begins with the slow and gentle application of disturbing influences to the state of a variable in the environment which the researcher surmises is already under control by the observed organism. It is essential not to overwhelm the organism's ability to control, since that is what is being investigated. If the organism changes its actions just so as to prevent the disturbing influence from having the expected effect on that variable, that is strong evidence that the experimental action disturbed a controlled variable. It is crucially important to distinguish the perceptions and point of view of the observer from those of the observed organism. It may take a number of variations of the test to isolate just which aspect of the environmental situation is under control, as perceived by the observed organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Runkel | first =Philip J. | author-link = | title =People as living things | publisher =Living Control Systems Publishing | edition = | date =2003 | location =Hayward, CA | pages =77–79  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0-9740155-0-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marken.center.fielder&gt;{{cite journal | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | author-link = | title =Controlled variables: psychology as the center fielder views it | journal =American Journal of Psychology | volume =114 | issue =2 | pages =259–281 | publisher =University of Illinois Press | location = | date =2001 | language = | url = | jstor =1423517 | issn = | doi =10.2307/1423517 | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCT employs a [[black box]] methodology. The controlled variable as measured by the observer corresponds quantitatively to a reference value for a perception that the organism is controlling. The controlled variable is thus an objective index of the purpose or intention of those particular behavioral actions by the organism&amp;mdash;the goal which those actions consistently work to attain despite disturbances. With few exceptions, in the current state of [[neuroscience]] this internally maintained reference value is seldom directly observed as such (e.g. as a rate of firing in a neuron), since few researchers trace the relevant electrical and chemical variables by their specific pathways while a living organism is engaging in what we externally observe as behavior.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. works [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2EgcIyIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en listed here].&lt;/ref&gt; However, when a working negative feedback system simulated on a digital computer performs essentially identically to observed organisms, then the well understood negative feedback structure of the simulation or model (the white box) is understood to demonstrate the unseen negative feedback structure within the organism (the black box).&lt;ref name=Runkel.cast/&gt;

Data for individuals are not aggregated for statistical analysis;&lt;ref&gt;See Runkel 1990 on the limitations of statistical methods and the value of individual performance data.&lt;/ref&gt; instead, a generative model is built which replicates the data observed for individuals with very high fidelity (0.95 or better). To build such a model of a given behavioral situation requires careful measurements of three observed variables:

{|
|- valign="top"
| ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' || The input quantity, that aspect of the stimulus which the subject perceives and has been demonstrated to be controlling.
|- valign="top"
| ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' || The output quantity, that aspect of the subject's behavior which affects the state of ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.
|- valign="top"
| ''d'' || The disturbance, a value summing the effects that any other influences in the environment have on the state of ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. In a controlled experiment one aims to have just one disturbing influence that is under the control of the investigator, but in naturalistic observation the situation is frequently more complex.

A fourth value, the internally maintained reference ''r'' (a variable ′setpoint′), is deduced from the value at which the organism is observed to maintain ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', as determined by the test for controlled variables (described at the beginning of this section).

With two variables specified, the controlled input ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the reference ''r'', a properly designed control system, simulated on a digital computer, produces outputs ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' that almost precisely oppose unpredictable disturbances ''d'' to the controlled input. Further, the variance from perfect control accords well with that observed for living organisms.&lt;ref name=Powers2008&gt;{{cite book | last =Powers | first =William T. | title =Living Control Systems III: The fact of control | publisher =Benchmark Publications | date =2008 | location =New Canaan, CT | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0-9647121-8-8 }} [Mathematical appendix by Dr. Richard Kennaway. Includes computer programs for the reader to demonstrate and experimentally test the theory.]&lt;/ref&gt; Perfect control would result in zero effect of the disturbance, but living organisms are not perfect controllers, and the aim of PCT is to model living organisms. When a computer simulation performs with &gt;95% conformity to experimentally measured values, opposing the effect of unpredictable changes in ''d'' by generating (nearly) equal and opposite values of ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'', it is understood to model the behavior and the internal control-loop structure of the organism.&lt;ref name=Runkel-PLT/&gt;&lt;ref name=PCM1960/&gt;&lt;ref name=Powers73/&gt;

By extension, the elaboration of the theory constitutes a general model of cognitive process and behavior. With every specific model or simulation of behavior that is constructed and tested against observed data, the general model that is presented in the theory is exposed to potential challenge that could call for revision or could lead to refutation.

==Mathematics==

To illustrate the mathematical calculations employed in a PCT simulation, consider a pursuit tracking task in which the participant keeps a mouse cursor aligned with a moving target on a computer monitor.

The model assumes that a perceptual signal within the participant represents the magnitude of the input quantity ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. (This has been demonstrated to be a rate of firing in a neuron, at least at the lowest levels.)&lt;ref name=Powers73&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Behavior: The Control of Perception]]| year=1973| first=William T.| last=Powers| isbn=0-7045-0092-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yin.BG2014&gt;{{cite journal | last =Yin | first =Henry H. | author-link = | title =How Basal Ganglia Outputs Generate Behavior | journal =Advances in Neuroscience | volume =2014 | issue =768313 | pages =28 | publisher =Hindawi Publishing Corporation | location = | date =18 November 2014  | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi =10.1155/2014/768313 | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tracking task, the input quantity is the vertical distance between the target position ''T'' and the cursor position ''C'', and the random variation of the target position acts as the disturbance ''d'' of that input quantity. This suggests that the perceptual signal ''p'' quantitatively represents the cursor position ''C'' minus the target position T, as expressed in the equation ''p''=''C''&amp;ndash;''T''.

Between the perception of target and cursor and the construction of the signal representing the distance between them there is a delay of ''&amp;Tau;'' milliseconds, so that the working perceptual signal at time ''t'' represents the target-to-cursor distance at a prior time, ''t'' &amp;ndash; ''&amp;Tau;''. Consequently, the equation used in the model is

1. ''p''(''t'') = ''C''(''t&amp;ndash;&amp;Tau;'') &amp;ndash; ''T''(''t&amp;ndash;&amp;Tau;'')

The negative feedback control system receives a reference signal ''r'' which specifies the magnitude of the given perceptual signal which is currently intended or desired. (For the origin of ''r'' within the organism, see under "[[#A hierarchy of control|A hierarchy of control]]", below.) Both ''r'' and ''p'' are input to a simple neural structure with ''r'' excitatory and ''p'' inhibitory. This structure is called a "comparator".&lt;ref name=Powers73/&gt; The effect is to subtract ''p'' from ''r'', yielding an error signal ''e'' that indicates the magnitude and sign of the difference between the desired magnitude ''r'' and the currently input magnitude ''p'' of the given perception. The equation representing this in the model is:

2. ''e'' = ''r&amp;ndash;p''

The error signal ''e'' must be transformed to the output quantity ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' (representing the participant's muscular efforts affecting the mouse position). Experiments have shown that in the best model for the output function, the mouse velocity ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'' is proportional to the error signal ''e'' by a gain factor ''G'' (that is, ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''G''*''e''). Thus, when the perceptual signal ''p'' is smaller than the reference signal ''r'', the error signal ''e'' has a positive sign, and from it the model computes an upward velocity of the cursor that is proportional to the error.

The next position of the cursor ''C&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the current position ''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' plus the velocity ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'' times the duration ''dt'' of one iteration of the program. By simple algebra, we substitute ''G''*''e'' (as given above) for ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'', yielding a third equation:

3. ''C&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''G''*''e''*''dt''

These three simple equations or program steps constitute the simplest form of the model for the tracking task. When these three simultaneous equations are evaluated over and over with the same random disturbances ''d'' of the target position that the human participant experienced, the output positions and velocities of the cursor duplicate the participant's actions in the tracking task above within 4.0% of their peak-to-peak range, in great detail.

This simple model can be refined with a damping factor ''d'' which reduces the discrepancy between the model and the human participant to 3.6% when the disturbance ''d'' is set to maximum difficulty.

3'. ''C&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' + [(''G''*''e'')&amp;ndash;(''d''*''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'')]*''dt''

Detailed discussion of this model in (Powers 2008)&lt;ref name=Powers2008/&gt; includes both source and executable code, with which the reader can verify how well this simple program simulates real behavior. No consideration is needed of possible nonlinearities such as the [[Weber-Fechner Law|Weber-Fechner law]], potential noise in the system, continuously varying angles at the joints, and many other factors that could afflict performance if this were a simple linear model. No [[inverse kinematics]] or predictive calculations are required. The model simply reduces the discrepancy between input ''p'' and reference ''r'' continuously as it arises in real time, and that is all that is required&amp;mdash;as predicted by the theory.&lt;ref name=Runkel-PLT/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powers73" /&gt;

==PCT as a solution to GOFAI complexity==

[Symbolic_artificial_intelligence|Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI)] is an early (1960s) approach to building intelligent systems. GOFAI assumes that AI programs are more complex versions of existing software designs, and that they can be built by extending existing procedural approaches and standard software methodologies. Objections to GOFAI can be separated into those based on program semantics, and those based on algorithmic complexity.

Implicit in the  theoretical approach  to GOFAI is the belief that minds (animal and human) are essentially syntactic, that is, made from symbols combined into expressions, a stance known as the [[Physical symbol system|Physical Symbol Systems Hypothesis]]. In recent years, this belief has been challenged by those who believe that minds are essentially semantic, i.e. they process embodied and situated meaning, not abstract data symbols. The 'poster child' of this oppositional stance is a thought experiment (Gedankenexperiment) called [[Chinese Room|Searle's Chinese Room (SCR)]], named after its inventor, philosopher [[John Searle]]. PCT is inherently situated, embodied, and dynamic.

Practical attempts  to building GOFAI soon run into asymptotic increases in algorithmic complexity, so-called 'complexity explosions'. They arise from the control paradigm assumed by GOFAI practitioners, which views governance (= feedforward command + feedback control) as modeling. In other words, for a GOFAI system to 'reason' about the world, it must first build an internal symbolic model of that world upon which it can apply sequences of symbolic manipulations in accord with the principles of [[Turing machine|Turing]] and [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] abstract machines. Even small changes in the world must be updated by the GOFAI program, in case they might be critical to its logical output. But any world model which contains sufficient detail to ensure correct GOFAI output is inevitably too complex, with too many moving parts to be practical, so that by the time world changes are updated, the world has already moved on.

PCT avoids the complexity issues of GOFAI by basing its real-time governance on a perceptual window (dimensionally reduced projection) of the world, which is much more tractable than the entire world. [[Jakob von Uexküll|Uexküll]],{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}, Dyer,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} and Powers arrived independently at this insight, which is important for robotics.

==Distinctions from engineering control theory==

In the artificial systems that are specified by [[Control theory|engineering control theory]], the reference signal is considered to be an external input to the 'plant'.&lt;ref name=Astrom/&gt; In engineering control theory, the reference signal or set point is public; in PCT, it is not, but rather must be deduced from the results of the test for controlled variables, as described above in the [[#The methodology of modeling, and PCT as model|methodology section]]. This is because in living systems a reference signal is not an externally accessible input, but instead originates within the system. In the hierarchical model, error output of higher-level control loops, as described in the [[#A hierarchy of control|next section below]], evokes the reference signal ''r'' from synapse-local memory, and the strength of ''r'' is proportional to the (weighted) strength of the error signal or signals from one or more higher-level systems.&lt;ref name=levels&gt;{{Citation | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | first2 =Powers | last2 =William T. | contribution =Levels of intention in behavior | year =1989 | title =Volitional Action | editor-last =Hershberger | editor-first =Wayne | pages =409–430 | place =Amsterdam | publisher =Elsevier B.V. | series =Advances in psychology | volume =62 | isbn =978-0-444-88318-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In engineering control systems, in the case where there are several such reference inputs, a 'Controller' is designed to manipulate those inputs so as to obtain the effect on the output of the system that is desired by the system's designer, and the task of a control theory (so conceived) is to calculate those manipulations so as to avoid instability and oscillation. The designer of a PCT model or simulation specifies no particular desired effect on the output of the system, except that it must be whatever is required to bring the input from the environment (the perceptual signal) into conformity with the reference. In Perceptual Control Theory, the input function for the reference signal is a weighted sum of internally generated signals (in the canonical case, higher-level error signals), and loop stability is determined locally for each loop in the manner sketched in the preceding section on the [[#Mathematics of PCT|mathematics of PCT]] (and elaborated more fully in the [[#References|referenced literature]]). The weighted sum is understood to result from [[#Reorganization in evolution, development, and learning|reorganization]].

Engineering control theory is computationally demanding, but as the [[#Mathematics of PCT|preceding section]] shows, PCT is not. For example, contrast the implementation of a model of an [[inverted pendulum]] in engineering control theory&lt;ref&gt;Documented e.g. at [http://csuchico-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.4/145/4%2022%2009%20Jose%20Miranda.pdf?sequence=1 Miranda, José Luis Corona. 2009.

This is one of many computer demonstrations that are available, with source code, at [http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/demos/tutor_pct.html www.livingcontrolsystems.com/demos/tutor_pct.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==A hierarchy of control==

Perceptions, in PCT, are constructed and controlled in a hierarchy of levels. For example, visual perception of an object is constructed from differences in light intensity or differences in sensations such as color at its edges. Controlling the shape or location of the object requires altering the perceptions of sensations or intensities (which are controlled by lower-level systems). This organizing principle is applied at all levels, up to the most abstract philosophical and theoretical constructs.

The Russian physiologist Nicolas Bernstein&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Nicolas. 1967. ''Coordination and regulation of movements''. New York: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; independently came to the same conclusion that behavior has to be multiordinal—organized hierarchically, in layers. A simple problem led to this conclusion at about the same time both in PCT and in Bernstein's work. The spinal reflexes act to stabilize limbs against disturbances. Why do they not prevent centers higher in the brain from using those limbs to carry out behavior? Since the brain obviously does use the spinal systems in producing behavior, there must be a principle that allows the higher systems to operate by incorporating the reflexes, not just by overcoming them or turning them off. The answer is that the reference value (setpoint) for a spinal reflex is not static; rather, it is varied by higher-level systems as their means of moving the limbs. This principle applies to higher feedback loops, as each loop presents the same problem to subsystems above it.

Whereas an engineered control system has a reference value or [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] adjusted by some external agency, the reference value for a biological control system cannot be set in this way. The setpoint must come from some internal process. If there is a way for behavior to affect it, any perception may be brought to the state momentarily specified by higher levels and then be maintained in that state against unpredictable disturbances. In a hierarchy of control systems, higher levels adjust the goals of lower levels as their means of approaching their own goals set by still-higher systems. This has important consequences for any proposed external control of an autonomous living control system (organism). At the highest level, reference values (goals) are set by heredity or adaptive processes.

==Reorganization in evolution, development, and learning==

If an organism controls inappropriate perceptions, or if it controls some perceptions to inappropriate values, then it is less likely to bring progeny to maturity, and may die. Consequently, by [[natural selection]] successive generations of organisms evolve so that they control those perceptions that, when controlled with appropriate setpoints, tend to maintain critical internal variables at optimal levels, or at least within non-lethal limits. Powers called these critical internal variables "intrinsic variables" (Ashby's "essential variables").

The mechanism that influences the development of structures of perceptions to be controlled is termed "reorganization", a process within the individual organism that is subject to natural selection just as is the evolved structure of individuals within a species.&lt;ref name="Byte"&gt;For an introduction, see the ''Byte'' articles on robotics and the article on the origins of purpose in this [http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/intro_papers/bill_pct.html collection].&lt;/ref&gt;

This "reorganization system" is proposed to be part of the inherited structure of the organism. It changes the underlying parameters and connectivity of the control hierarchy in a random-walk manner. There is a basic continuous rate of change in intrinsic variables which proceeds at a speed set by the total error (and stops at zero error), punctuated by random changes in direction in a hyperspace with as many dimensions as there are critical variables. This is a more or less direct adaptation of Ashby's "[[homeostat]]", first adopted into PCT in the 1960 paper&lt;ref name=PCM1960 /&gt; and then changed to use E. coli's method of navigating up gradients of nutrients, as described by Koshland (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Koshland, Daniel. (1980). ''Bacterial chemotaxis as a model behavioral system''. New York: Raven Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reorganization may occur at any level when loss of control at that level causes intrinsic (essential) variables to deviate from genetically determined set points. This is the basic mechanism that is involved in trial-and-error learning, which leads to the acquisition of more systematic kinds of learning processes.&lt;ref name="Cziko 1995"&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Without Miracles]]| year=1995| first=Gary| last=Cziko| isbn=0-262-03232-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict==

In a hierarchy of interacting control systems, different systems at one level can send conflicting goals to one lower system. When two systems are specifying different goals for the same lower-level variable, they are in [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]]. Protracted conflict is experienced by human beings as many forms of psychological distress such as anxiety, obsession, depression, confusion, and vacillation. Severe conflict prevents the affected systems from being able to control, effectively destroying their function for the organism.

Higher level control systems often are able to use known strategies (which are themselves acquired through prior reorganizations) to seek perceptions that don't produce the conflict. Normally, this takes place without notice. If the conflict persists and systematic "problem solving" by higher systems fails, the reorganization system may modify existing systems until they bypass the conflict or until they produce new reference signals (goals) that are not in conflict at lower levels.

When reorganization results in an arrangement that reduces or eliminates the error that is driving it, the process of reorganization slows or stops with the new organization in place. (This replaces the concept of reinforcement learning.) New means of controlling the perceptions involved, and indeed new perceptual constructs subject to control, may also result from reorganization. In simplest terms, the reorganization process varies things until something works, at which point we say that the organism has learned. When simulations of this method are done in the right way, they demonstrate that this method is surprisingly efficient.

==Psychotherapy: the method of levels (MOL)==
{{Main|Method of levels}}

The reorganization concept has led to a method of psychotherapy called the [[method of levels]] (MOL). Using MOL, the therapist aims to help the patient shift his or her awareness to higher levels of perception in order to resolve conflicts and allow reorganization to take place.&lt;ref name=Mansell.Carey.2012&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mansell |first1=Warren |last2=Carey |first2=Timothy A |last3=Tai |first3=Sara |title=A transdiagnostic approach to CBT using method of levels therapy: distinctive features |year=2012 |series=The CBT distinctive features series |location=Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9780415507639 |oclc=774499959 |doi=10.4324/9780203081334 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==

===Learning===

Currently, no one theory has been agreed upon to explain the synaptic, neuronal or systemic basis of learning. Prominent since 1973, however, is the idea that [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) of populations of [[synapse]]s induces learning through both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms (Bliss &amp; Lømo, 1973; Bliss &amp; Gardner-Medwin, 1973). LTP is a form of [[Hebbian learning]], which proposed that high-frequency, tonic activation of a circuit of neurones increases the efficacy with which they are activated and the size of their response to a given stimulus as compared to the standard neurone (Hebb, 1949).&lt;ref name=Hebb49&gt;{{cite book | last =Hebb | first =Donald | title =The organization of behavior: A neuropsychological theory | publisher =Wiley &amp; Sons | date =1949 | location =New York | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanisms are the principles behind Hebb's famously simple explanation: "Those that fire together, wire together" (Hebb, 1949).

LTP has received much support since it was first observed by [[Terje Lømo]] in 1966 and is still the subject of many modern studies and clinical research. However, there are possible alternative mechanisms underlying LTP, as presented by Enoki, Hu, Hamilton and Fine in 2009, published in the journal ''[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]]''. They concede that LTP is the basis of learning. However, they firstly propose that LTP occurs in individual synapses, and this plasticity is graded (as opposed to in a binary mode) and bidirectional (Enoki et al., 2009). Secondly, the group suggest that the synaptic changes are expressed solely presynaptically, via changes in the probability of transmitter release (Enoki et al., 2009). Finally, the team predict that the occurrence of LTP could be age-dependent, as the plasticity of a neonatal brain would be higher than that of a mature one. Therefore, the theories differ, as one proposes an on/off occurrence of LTP by pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms and the other proposes only presynaptic changes, graded ability, and age-dependence.

These theories do agree on one element of LTP, namely, that it must occur through physical changes to the synaptic membrane/s, i.e. synaptic plasticity. Perceptual control theory encompasses both of these views. It proposes the mechanism of [[#Reorganization in evolution, development, and learning|'reorganisation']] as the basis of learning. Reorganisation occurs within the inherent control system of a human or animal by restructuring the inter- and intraconnections of its hierarchical organisation, akin to the neuroscientific phenomenon of neural plasticity. This reorganisation initially allows the trial-and-error form of learning, which is seen in babies, and then progresses to more structured learning through association, apparent in infants, and finally to systematic learning, covering the adult ability to learn from both internally and externally  generated stimuli and events. In this way, PCT provides a valid model for learning that combines the biological mechanisms of LTP with an explanation of the progression and change of mechanisms associated with developmental ability (Plooij 1984,&lt;ref name=Plooij1984&gt;{{cite book | last =Plooij | first =Frans X. | title =The behavioral development of free-living chimpanzee babies and infants. | publisher =Ablex | date =1984 | location =Norwood, N.J. | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1987,&lt;ref name=Plooij-Plooij1987&gt;{{cite journal | last =van de Rijt-Plooij | first =Hetty | last2 =Plooij | first2 =Frans | author-link = | title =Growing independence, conflict and learning in mother-infant relations in free-ranging chimpanzees | journal =Behaviour | volume =101 | issue = | pages =1–86 | publisher = | location = | date =1987 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.1163/156853987x00378| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2003,&lt;ref name=Plooij2003&gt;{{Citation | last =Plooij | first =Frans X. | contribution = | year =2003 | title =The trilogy of mind | editor-last =Heimann | editor-first =M. | volume =Regression periods in human infancy | pages =185–205 | place =Mahwah, New Jersey | publisher =Erlbaum | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plooij &amp; Plooij (1990),&lt;ref name=Plooij-Plooij1990&gt;{{cite journal | last =Plooij | first =Frans X. | last2 =van de Rijt-Plooij | first2 =Hetty | title =Developmental transitions as successive reorganizations of a control hierarchy | journal =American Behavioral Scientist | volume =34 | issue = | pages =67–80 | publisher = | location = | date =1990 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.1177/0002764290034001007| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013&lt;ref name="Plooij-Plooij2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=[[The Wonder Weeks]]: How to Stimulate Your Baby's Mental Development and Help Him Turn His 10 Predictable, Great, Fussy Phases into Magical Leaps Forward|last=van de Rijt-Plooij|first=Hetty|last2=Plooij|first2=Frans|date=October 22, 2013|publisher=Kiddy World Publishing|year=|isbn=9491882007|location=Arnhem, Netherlands|pages=480|language=|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Powers (2008) produced a simulation of arm co-ordination.&lt;ref name=Powers2008/&gt; He suggested that in order to move your arm, fourteen control systems that control fourteen joint angles are involved, and they reorganise simultaneously and independently. It was found that for optimum performance, the output functions must be organised in a way so as each control system's output only affects the one environmental variable it is perceiving. In this simulation, the reorganising process is working as it should, and just as Powers suggests that it works in humans, reducing outputs that cause error and increasing those that reduce error. Initially, the disturbances have large effects on the angles of the joints, but over time the joint angles match the reference signals more closely due to the system being reorganised. Powers (2008) suggests that in order to achieve coordination of joint angles to produce desired movements, instead of calculating how multiple joint angles must change to produce this movement the brain uses negative feedback systems to generate the joint angles that are required. A single reference signal that is varied in a higher-order system can generate a movement that requires several joint angles to change at the same time.&lt;ref name=Powers2008/&gt;

===Hierarchical organisation===

Botvinick (2008) proposed that one of the founding insights of the cognitive revolution was the recognition of hierarchical structure in human behavior. Despite decades of research, however, the computational mechanisms underlying hierarchically organized behavior are still not fully understood. Bedre, Hoffman, Cooney &amp; D'Esposito (2009) propose that the fundamental goal in cognitive neuroscience is to characterize the functional organization of the frontal cortex that supports the control of action.

Recent neuroimaging data has supported the hypothesis that the frontal lobes are organized hierarchically, such that control is supported in progressively caudal regions as control moves to more concrete specification of action. However, it is still not clear whether lower-order control processors are differentially affected by impairments in higher-order control when between-level interactions are required to complete a task, or whether there are feedback influences of lower-level on higher-level control (Bedre, Hoffman, Cooney &amp; D'Esposito 2009).

Botvinik (2008) found that all existing models of hierarchically structured behavior share at least one general assumption – that the hierarchical, part–whole organization of human action is mirrored in the internal or neural representations underlying it. Specifically, the assumption is that there exist representations not only of low-level motor behaviors, but also separable representations of higher-level behavioral units. The latest crop of models provides new insights, but also poses new or refined questions for empirical research, including how abstract action representations emerge through learning, how they interact with different modes of action control, and how they sort out within the prefrontal cortex (PFC).

Perceptual control theory (PCT) can provide an explanatory model of neural organisation that deals with the current issues. PCT describes the hierarchical character of behavior as being determined by control of hierarchically organized perception. Control systems in the body and in the internal environment of billions of interconnected neurons within the brain are responsible for keeping perceptual signals within survivable limits in the unpredictably variable environment from which those perceptions are derived. PCT does not propose that there is an internal model within which the brain simulates behavior before issuing commands to execute that behavior. Instead, one of its characteristic features is the principled lack of cerebral organisation of behavior. Rather, behavior is the organism's variable means to reduce the discrepancy between perceptions and reference values which are based on various external and internal inputs (Cools, 1985). Behavior must constantly adapt and change for an organism to maintain its perceptual goals. In this way, PCT can provide an explanation of abstract learning through spontaneous reorganisation of the hierarchy. PCT proposes that conflict occurs between disparate reference values for a given perception rather than between different responses (Mansell 2011), and that learning is implemented as trial-and-error changes of the properties of control systems (Marken &amp; Powers 1989),&lt;ref name=levels/&gt; rather than any specific response being ''reinforced''. In this way, behavior remains adaptive to the environment as it unfolds, rather than relying on learned action patterns that may not fit.

Hierarchies of perceptual control have been simulated in computer models and have been shown to provide a close match to behavioral data. For example, Marken&lt;ref name=Marken86&gt;{{cite journal | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | author-link = | title =Perceptual organization of behavior: A hierarchical control model of coordinated action. | journal =Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume =12 | issue =3 | pages =267–276 | publisher = | location = | date =Aug 1986 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi =10.1037/0096-1523.12.3.267 | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted an experiment comparing the behavior of a perceptual control hierarchy computer model with that of six healthy volunteers in three experiments. The participants were required to keep the distance between a left line and a centre line equal to that of the centre line and a right line. They were also instructed to keep both distances equal to 2&amp;nbsp;cm. They had 2 paddles in their hands, one controlling the left line and one controlling the middle line. To do this, they had to resist random disturbances applied to the positions of the lines. As the participants achieved control, they managed to nullify the expected effect of the disturbances by moving their paddles. The correlation between the behavior of subjects and the model in all the experiments approached .99. It is proposed that the organization of models of hierarchical control systems such as this informs us about the organization of the human subjects whose behavior it so closely reproduces.

==Robotics==

PCT has significant implications for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. The architecture, of a hierarchy of perceptual controllers, is an ideal and comparatively simple implementation for artificial systems by avoiding the need to generate specific actions whether by complex models of the external world or the computation from input-output mappings. 
This is in stark contrast to traditional methodologies, such as the computational approach and Behavior-based Robotics.

The application of perceptual control to Robotics was outlined in a seminal paper &lt;ref name=Young2017&gt;{{cite journal | last =Young| first =Rupert | author-link = | title =A General Architecture for Robotics Systems: A Perception-Based Approach to Artificial Life. | journal =Artificial Life| volume =23 | issue =2 | pages =236–286 | date =Jun 2017 | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Artificial Life journal by Rupert Young of Perceptual Robots in 2017.  The architecture has been applied to a number of real-world robotic systems including robotic rovers,&lt;ref&gt;

Traditional approaches to robotics, which generally depend upon the computation of actions in specific situations, result in inflexible, clumsy robots unable to cope with the dynamic nature of the world. PCT robots, on the other hand, demonstrate robots that inherently resist and counter the chaotic, unpredictable world.

==Current situation and prospects==

The preceding explanation of PCT principles provides justification of how this theory can provide a valid explanation of neural organisation and how it can explain some of the current issues of conceptual models.

Perceptual control theory currently proposes a hierarchy of 11 levels of perceptions controlled by systems in the human mind and neural architecture. These are: intensity, sensation, configuration, transition, event, relationship, category, sequence, program, principle, and system concept. Diverse perceptual signals at a lower level (e.g. visual perceptions of intensities) are combined in an input function to construct a single perception at the higher level (e.g. visual perception of a color sensation). The perceptions that are constructed and controlled at the lower levels are passed along as the perceptual inputs at the higher levels. The higher levels in turn control by adjusting the reference levels (goals) of the lower levels, in effect telling the lower levels what to perceive.&lt;ref name=Powers73/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cziko 1995"/&gt;

While many computer demonstrations of principles have been developed, the proposed higher levels are difficult to model because too little is known about how the brain works at these levels. Isolated higher-level control processes can be investigated, but models of an extensive hierarchy of control are still only conceptual, or at best rudimentary.

Perceptual control theory has not been widely accepted in mainstream psychology, but has been effectively used in a considerable range of domains&lt;ref&gt;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-28/november-2015/perceptual-control-revolution&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/06/book-review-behavior-the-control-of-perception/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IJHCS"&gt;The June 1999 Issue of ''The International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'' contained papers ranging from tracking through cockpit layout to self-image and crowd dynamics.&lt;/ref&gt; in human factors,&lt;ref name="CBUT"&gt;PCT lies at the foundation of [[Component-Based Usability Testing]].&lt;/ref&gt; clinical psychology, and psychotherapy (the "[[Method of Levels]]"), it is the basis for a considerable body of research in sociology,&lt;ref&gt;For example: McClelland, Kent A. and Thomas J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7522">[[Image:Fiederung.svg|thumb|right|300px|'''Figure 1''' Pennate muscle fiber arrangements. The green lines represent PCSA; the blue lines represent ACSA]]

In [[muscle]] [[physiology]], '''physiological cross-sectional area''' (PCSA) is the area of the cross section of a [[muscle]] perpendicular to its fibers, generally at its largest point. It is typically used to describe the contraction properties of [[pennate muscle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jp.physoc.org/cgi/content/abstract/338/1/37 Strength and cross-sectional area of human skeletal muscle]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the same as the anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA), which is the area of the crossection of a muscle perpendicular to its longitudinal axis. In a non-pennate muscle the fibers are parallel to the longitudinal axis, and therefore PCSA and ACSA coincide.

== Definition ==

One advantage of pennate muscles is that more muscle fibers can be packed in parallel, thus allowing the muscle to produce more force, although the fiber angle to the direction of action means that the maximum force in that direction is somewhat less than the maximum force in the fiber direction.&lt;ref name = Gans&gt;
C. Gans (1982). Fiber architecture and muscle function. Exercise &amp; Sports Science Reviews. 10:160–207.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Otten&gt;
E. Otten (1988). Concepts and models of functional architecture in skeletal muscles. Exercise &amp; Sports Science Reviews. 16:89–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The muscle cross-sectional area (blue line in figure 1, also known as anatomical cross-section area, or ACSA) does not accurately represent the number of muscle fibers in the muscle. A better estimate is provided by the total area of the cross-sections perpendicular to the muscle fibers (green lines in figure 1). This measure is known as the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), and is commonly calculated and defined by the following formula, developed in 1975 by Alexander and Vernon:&lt;ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{PCSA} = {\text{muscle volume} \over \text{fiber length}} = 
                     {\text{muscle mass}   \over {\rho \cdot \text{fiber length}}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is the density of the muscle: 
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = {\text{muscle mass} \over \text{muscle volume}}.&lt;/math&gt;

PCSA increases with pennation angle, and with muscle length. In a pennate muscle, PCSA is always larger than ACSA. In a non-pennate muscle, it coincides with ACSA.

=== Estimating muscle force from PCSA ===
The total force exerted by the fibers in their oblique direction is proportional to PCSA. If the ''specific tension'' of the muscle fibers is known (force exerted by the fibers per unit of PCSA), it can be computed as follows:&lt;ref name="Sacks"&gt;R.D. Sacks, R.R. Roy (1982). Architecture of The Hind Limb Muscles of Cats: Functional Significance. Journal of Morphology, 185–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Total force} = \text{PCSA} \cdot \text{Specific tension}&lt;/math&gt;

However, only a component of that force can be used to pull the tendon in the desired direction. This component, which is the true ''muscle force'' (also called ''tendon force''&lt;ref name="Maganaris" /&gt;), is exerted along the direction of action of the muscle:&lt;ref name="Maganaris"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Muscle force} = \text{Total force} \cdot \cos \Phi&lt;/math&gt;

The other component, orthogonal to the direction of action of the muscle (Orthogonal force = Total force × sinΦ) is not exerted on the tendon, but simply squeezes the muscle, by pulling its aponeuroses toward each other.

Notice that, although it is practically convenient to compute PCSA based on volume or mass and fiber length, PCSA (and therefore the total fiber force, which is proportional to PCSA) is not proportional to muscle mass or fiber length alone. Namely, the maximum ([[tetanic contraction|tetanic]]) force of a muscle fiber simply depends on its thickness (cross-section area) and [[Skeletal muscle#Muscle fibers|type]]. By no means it depends on its mass or length alone. For instance, when muscle mass increases due to [[Human development (biology)|physical development]] during childhood, this may be only due to an increase in length of the muscle fibers, with no change in fiber thickness (PCSA) or fiber type. In this case, an increase in mass does not produce an increase in force.

Sometimes, the increase in mass is associated with an increase in thickness. Only in this case it will have some effect on fiber force, but this effect will be proportional to the increase in thickness, not to the increase in mass. For instance, in some stages of physical development, the increase in mass may be due to both an increase in PCSA and in fiber length. Even in this case, muscle force does not increase as much as muscle mass does, because the mass increase is partly produced by a variation in fiber length, and fiber length has no effect on muscle force.

== Alternative definition ==
In 1982 a different definition of PCSA, herein denoted PCSA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to facilitate comparison with the previous definition, was introduced by Sacks &amp; Roy:&lt;ref name="Sacks"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{PCSA}_2 = {\text{muscle volume} \cdot \cos \Phi \over \text{fiber length}} = 
                       {\text{muscle mass}   \cdot \cos \Phi \over {\rho \cdot \text{fiber length}}},&lt;/math&gt;

The comparison shows that 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{PCSA}_2 = \text{PCSA} \cdot \cos \Phi.&lt;/math&gt;

in a pennate muscle, since &lt;math&gt;\cos\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is always smaller than 1, PCSA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is always smaller than PCSA. Hence, it cannot be described as the total area of the cross-sections perpendicular to the muscle fibers (green lines in figure 1). It can be interpreted two ways:
# Projection of PCSA (green line in figure 1) on the anatomical cross-section plane (blue line).&lt;ref&gt;This is because the angle between the anatomical and physiological cross-section planes (angle between blue line and green line in figure 1) coincides with &amp;Phi;, by definition.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ACSA of a non-pennate muscle with the same force as the pennate muscle.&lt;ref&gt;In a non-pennate muscle, ACSA = Muscle force / Specific tension, and Muscle force = PCSA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × Specific tension, hence PCSA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = Muscle force / Specific tension = ACSA.&lt;/ref&gt;

This implies that, in a muscle such as that in figure 1A, PCSA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coincides with ACSA. The disadvantage of this definition is its more complex interpretation, its advantage is that muscle force can be computed more directly:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Muscle force} = \text{PCSA}_2 \cdot \text{Specific tension}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Sacks"/&gt;

Currently, some authors keep using the original definition of PCSA,&lt;ref name="Narici" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maganaris" /&gt; probably because of its intuitively appealing geometrical interpretation (figure 1).

'''Plant disease forecasting''' is a management system used to predict the occurrence or change in severity of [[phytopathology|plant diseases]].  At the field scale, these systems are used by growers to make economic decisions about disease treatments for control.  Often the systems ask the grower a series of questions about the susceptibility of the [[host (biology)|host crop]], and incorporate current and forecast [[weather]] conditions to make a recommendation.  Typically a recommendation is made about whether disease treatment is necessary or not.  Usually treatment is a [[pesticide]] application.

Forecasting systems are based on assumptions about the pathogen's interactions with the host and environment, the [[Plant disease epidemiology|disease triangle]].&lt;ref name="Agrios"&gt;{{cite book| last =Agrios | first =George | authorlink = | title =Plant Pathology | publisher =Academic Press | date =2005 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0-12-044565-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective is to accurately predict when the three factors – host, environment, and pathogen – all interact in such a fashion that disease can occur and cause economic losses.

In most cases the host can be suitably defined as [[Gene-for-gene relationship|resistant]] or susceptible, and the presence of the pathogen may often be reasonably ascertained based on previous cropping history or perhaps survey data.  The environment is usually the factor that controls whether disease develops or not.  Environmental conditions may determine the presence of the pathogen in a particular season through their effects on processes such as [[overwintering]].  Environmental conditions also affect the ability of the pathogen to cause disease, e.g. a minimum [[leaf wetness]] duration is required for [[grey leaf spot]] of corn to occur.  In these cases a disease forecasting system attempts to define when the environment will be conducive to disease development.  

Good disease forecasting systems must be reliable, simple, cost-effective and applicable to many diseases. As such they are normally only designed for diseases that are irregular enough to warrant a prediction system, rather than diseases that occur every year for which regular treatment should be employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Campbell | first =C.

Polycyclic epidemics such as [[Phytophthora infestans|potato late blight]] are usually best modelled by using the logistic model, whereas monocyclic epidemics may be best modelled using the monomolecular model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Madden | first =Laurence | authorlink = |author2=Gareth Hughes |author3=Frank Van Den Bosch  | title =Study of Plant Disease Epidemics | publisher =American Phytopathological Society | date =2007 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0-89054-354-2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Correct choice of a model is essential for a disease forecasting system to be useful.

Plant disease forecasting models must be thoroughly tested and validated after being developed.  Interest has arisen lately in [[model validation]] through the quantification of the economic costs of [[false positives]] and [[false negatives]], where disease prevention measures may be used when unnecessary or not applied when needed respectively.&lt;ref name="Esker" /&gt;  The costs of these two types of errors need to be weighed carefully before deciding to use a disease forecasting system.

== Future developments ==

In the future, disease forecasting systems may become more useful as computing power increases and the amount of data that is available to plant pathologists to construct models increases. Good forecasting systems also may become increasingly important with [[climate change]].  It will be important to be able to accurately predict where disease outbreaks may occur, since they may not be in the historically known areas.

The PTLLS is currently the lowest of the teaching qualifications specifically for this sector of education, with others being the [[Qualifications and Credit Framework|QCF]] Level 3/4 [[Certificate in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector]] (CTLLS)&lt;ref name="C&amp;GCT292014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityandguilds.com/qualifications-and-apprenticeships/learning/teaching/6304-teaching-in-the-lifelong-learning-sector-ctlls#tab=information |title=Certificate in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector (CTLLS) (6304) |date=29 Aug 2014 |author=City &amp; Guilds}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Qualifications and Credit Framework|QCF]] Level 5 [[Diploma in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector]] (DTLLS)&lt;ref name="C&amp;GDT292014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityandguilds.com/qualifications-and-apprenticeships/learning/teaching/6305-teaching-in-the-lifelong-learning-sector-dtlls#tab=information |title=Diploma in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector (DTLLS) (6305) |date=29 Aug 2014 |author=City &amp; Guilds}}&lt;/ref&gt; qualifications. Following successful completion of the PTLLS and upon achieving the qualification, an associate teacher would then have to take the more advanced CTLLS for the Certificate and after that the DTLLS for the Diploma.

To achieve the certification, the learner/associate teacher/trainer does not have to be in a teaching role in order to be assessed, making it a very achievable certification and a suitable starting point for anyone wanting to become an educator. Assessment is in the form of a 'micro-teach' session and submission of assignments and portfolio of evidence. The Level 4 CTLLS, however, requires one to be in a teaching or training role in order to be assessed 'on-the-job', as well as through the submission of assignments and a portfolio of evidence.

The PTLLS is the first stage of a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] (Post Graduate Certificate in Education) in [[Lifelong learning]] and is currently required prior to achieving the CTLLS and DTLLS to gain [[Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills]] (QTLS) status. It is a requirement that all teachers obtain the PTLLS award, or the equivalent, to be able to continue to teach in the [[further education]] sector in the UK.

The PTLLS is in the process of being phased out along with the CTLLS and the DTLLS, and will eventually be replaced with the [[Award in Education and Training]] qualification at QCF Level 3, 4 and 5, respectively.&lt;ref name="C&amp;GITTMay2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talent.ac.uk/uploads/news/2978_City&amp;Guilds_Need_to_know_May_v1.pdf |title=For the attention of the Initial Teacher Training PTLLS/CTLLS/DTLLS tutors, teachers and coordinators |date=May 2013 |author=City &amp; Guilds |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908041411/http://www.talent.ac.uk/uploads/news/2978_City%26Guilds_Need_to_know_May_v1.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sakarya University Middle East Institute''' ({{lang-tr|Sakarya Üniversitesi Ortadoğu Enstitüsü}}, also known as '''ORMER''') is located on the campus of [[Sakarya University]] in Sakarya, Turkey. Its mission is to enhance understanding the Middle East and contribute with rigorous programs to research and teaching on the people, economies, religions and politics of the region. As part of this mission, the institute hosts graduate programs and organizes academic conferences and events. Almost half of ORMER’s graduate students are international, coming mostly from the Balkans, the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. ORMER has more than 10 full-time faculty and 18 research assistants.

==History==
The idea of Sakarya University Middle East Institute goes back to the year 2005 when the first issue of Middle East Annual ('''Ortadoğu Yıllığı''') was published by a group of academics including the founding director of the institute, [[Kemal Inat]]. In the aftermath of the [[Arab Spring]], this idea turned a concrete step with the opening of a master program on the Middle East under the Social Science Institute of [[Sakarya University]] in May 2012. At the same year, an online master program on the Middle East was also inaugurated. Those who opened Master-level programs organized the first Middle East Congress on Politics and Society between 9 and 11 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://researchturkey.org/middle-eastern-congress-on-politics-and-society-conference/&lt;/ref&gt;

After the opening of another Middle East program at PhD level, '''the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Sakarya University''' was established on 11 December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2013/12/20131211-9.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of the center was the effect of the [[Arab Spring]] on politics, society and economy of the Middle East. Accordingly, the second Middle East Congress on Politics and Society was organized in order to deal with effects of the Arab Spring on the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;http://ormer.sakarya.edu.tr/en/ii-middle-eastern-congress-on-politics-and-society/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:ormer.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Building of Middle East Institute]]
According to founding director of the institute, Turkey's need for academically-educated experts on the Middle East became a problem especially after two important political developments in the opening years of the 21st Century, rising interest of Turkey towards the Middle East region, and political turmoil following the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sakaryayenigun.com.tr/19039-uzmanlar-burada-yetisiyor-haberi.html&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by these political developments, the center reorganized itself as an institute. Therefore, Sakarya University Middle East Institute was officially established on May 25, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2015/06/20150605-25-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and all graduate programs and staff were transferred to this institute. However, the institute continues to use ORMER as its abbreviation. ORMER is a shortened form of '''Ortadoğu Merkezi''' (Middle East Center).

==Graduate programs==
'''Sakarya University Middle East Institute''' mainly offers graduate programs of study at both MA level and PhD level. Both MA and PhD programs cover a wide range of elective courses (such as media, international relations, postcolonial studies, religion, and sociology).

'''Master of Arts''' (MA) - This two-year degree program is research-focused, allowing students to produce an original 15,000-word thesis. The program’s interdisciplinary coursework emphasizes contemporary Middle Eastern politics, Middle Eastern history, Middle Eastern economies, and Islamic studies. Courses are lectured in Turkish and English.

'''Doctor of Philosophy''' (PhD) - This at least four-year degree program is research-focused, composing three stages, completion of coursework, a [[comprehensive examination]], and a dissertation. After student complete first two stages, they are expected to produce an original dissertation. The program’s interdisciplinary coursework emphasizes political theories with a special focus on the Middle East, Islamic philosophy, religious studies, and security studies. Courses are lectured in Turkish and English.

In addition to graduate programs, ORMER also provides courses on main Middle Eastern languages such as Arabic, Persian, and Hebrew.

==Activities==
As part of its mission, Sakarya University Middle East Institute offers a variety of opportunities including conferences, lecture series, workshops, and outreach activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://ormer.sakarya.edu.tr/en/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; The institute also publishes booklets, detailed reports, policy briefs, and short commentaries on current affairs of the Middle East.

The main activity of the institute is to organize '''Middle East Congress on Politics and Society''' biennially. Prior to the establishment of the institute, this congress was organized firstly by [[Department of International Relations, Sakarya University]] in 2012. The second Middle East Congress on Politics and Society was organized by the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at [[Sakarya University]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://ormer.sakarya.edu.tr/en/i-middle-eastern-congress/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ibn Khaldun Library==
The Ibn Khaldun Library, which is named after the leading Islamic sociologist [[Ibn Khaldun]], is one of the largest libraries collecting books on the Middle East in [[Turkey]]. It contains over 10,000 books, and many periodicals focusing on the Middle East. Although it is a newly established library, it includes a significant number of academic sources on [[postcolonial studies]]. The library also provides Web access to its own holdings, and the holdings of the main library of [[Sakarya University]].

The library is located on the first floor of the institute building.

==Periodicals==
In addition to policy briefs, and short commentaries published in its web page on occasion, '''Sakarya University Middle East Institute''' is the editorial home to a peer-review academic journal and a peer-review academic annual, both of which focus particularly on the Middle East.

[[The Middle East Annual]], ({{lang-tr|Ortadoğu Yıllığı}}), published since 2005, covers political, economic and societal developments in each country of the Middle East.

[[Turkish Journal of Middle Eastern Studies]] ({{lang-tr|Türkiye Ortadoğu Çalışmaları Dergisi}}),&lt;ref&gt;http://tjmes.org/index.php/TJMES&lt;/ref&gt; published since 2014, is a peer-review academic journal.

A '''stressor''' is a chemical or [[biological agent]], [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] condition, [[Stimulus (physiology)|external stimulus]] or an event that causes [[Stress (biology)|stress]] to an [[biological organism|organism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sato|first1=Tadatoshi|last2=Yamamoto|first2=Hironori|last3=Sawada|first3=Naoki|last4=Nashiki|first4=Kunitaka|last5=Tsuji|first5=Mitsuyoshi|last6=Muto|first6=Kazusa|last7=Kume|first7=Hisae|last8=Sasaki|first8=Hajime|last9=Arai|first9=Hidekazu|last10=Nikawa|first10=Takeshi|last11=Taketani|first11=Yutaka|last12=Takeda|first12=Eiji|title=Restraint stress alters the duodenal expression of genes important for lipid metabolism in rat|journal=Toxicology|date=October 2006|volume=227|issue=3|pages=248–261|doi=10.1016/j.tox.2006.08.009|pmid=16962226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologically speaking, a stressors can be events or environments that an individual would consider demanding, challenging, and or threaten the individual's safety.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Deckers, Lambert (2018). Motivation Biological, Psychological, and Environmental. New York, NY: Routledge. pp. 208-

212. &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN 978-1-138-03632-1&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

An event that triggers the [[stress response]] may include:
* environmental stressors ([[:en:Hypothermia|hypo]] or [[:en:Hyperthermia|hyper]]-thermic [[:en:Thermoregulation|temperatures]], [[noise health effects|elevated sound levels]], [[over-illumination]], [[overcrowding]])
* daily stress events (e.g., [[traffic]], lost keys, money, quality and quantity of physical activity)
* life changes (e.g., [[divorce]], bereavement)
* workplace stressors (e.g., high job demand vs. low job control, repeated or sustained exertions, forceful exertions, extreme postures)
* chemical stressors (e.g., [[tobacco]], [[alcohol]], drugs{{Specify |reason=Please provide specific examples. |date=March 2018}})
* social stressor (e.g., societal and family demands)

Stressors have physical, chemical and mental responses inside of the body. Physical stressors produce mechanical stresses on skin, bones, ligaments, tendons, muscles and nerves that cause tissue deformation and in extreme cases tissue failure.  Chemical stresses also produce biomechanical responses associated with [[metabolism]] and tissue repair. Physical stressors may produce pain and impair work performance.  Chronic pain and impairment requiring medical attention may result from extreme physical stressors or if there is not sufficient recovery time between successive exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council|title=Musculoskeletal Disorders and the Workplace: Low Back and Upper Extremities. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press|year=2001|publisher=National Academey Press|isbn=0-309-07284-0|pages=512|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council|title=Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders: Report, Workshop Summary, and Workshop Papers|year=199|publisher=National Academy Press|isbn=0-309-06397-3|pages=240|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=6431d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stressors may also affect mental function and performance. One possible mechanism involves stimulation of the [[hypothalamus]], CRF ([[corticotropin release factor]]) -&gt; [[pituitary gland]] releases ACTH ([[adrenocorticotropic hormone]]) -&gt; [[adrenal cortex]] secretes various stress hormones (e.g., [[cortisol]]) -&gt; [[stress hormone]]s (30 varieties) travel in the blood stream to relevant [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], e.g., [[glands]], [[heart]], [[intestines]] -&gt; [[flight-or-fight response]]. Between this flow there is an alternate path that can be taken after the stressor is transferred to the [[hypothalamus]], which leads to the sympathetic [[nervous system]]. After which, the [[adrenal medulla]] secretes [[epinephrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Stress?|url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/a-level/psychology/stress/revise-it/what-is-stress|publisher=S-Cool}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental and social stressors may affect behavior and how individuals respond to physical and chemical stressors.

Life requires everyone to make sudden and planned adjustments to meet its demands, but the greater the demand comes with a greater adjustment and possibly more stress. Determining the impact of these various stressors allow individuals to decide the relationship between the types of stressors and the degree of distress. Identifying the stressor-stress relationship must involve quantifying the impact of life demands and all stress spurred from it. To do this, subjective measures and objective measures will be used depending on the situation. Individuals determine the degree of adjustment themselves in subjective measures, but a degree of adjustment will be or has already been assigned to the individual in an objective measure. The degrees of adjustment are measured by life change units, where one unit equals a degree of adjustment necessary to cope with the life change. The practice of measuring life change units led to the creation of many scales composed of these units that are tailored to certain life events or situations, such as social readjustment and college students &lt;ref&gt;Deckers Page 215&lt;/ref&gt;. 
	Once the relationship between the stressor (event) and the stress, the individual can then begin to focus on the stress magnitude and the stress itself. For life events with a lower magnitude of impact, the ability to cope and adjust may not be very complex and relatively brief. But for others, life events with high magnitudes can impact their lives in many ways for an extended amount of time. The various stressors listed above can all have events or stressors that range anywhere from minor to traumatic. Traumatic events are very debilitating stressors, and often times these stressors are uncontrollable. Traumatic events can deplete an individual’s coping resources to an extent where the individual may develop acute stress disorder or even post-traumatic stress disorder. Acute stress disorder is a psychological disorder where a traumatic event that is life threatening or threatens an injury causes a reaction of fear and helplessness lasting up to four weeks. Post-traumatic stress disorder has symptoms of lasting longer than one month, and the first symptom is a history of experiencing a traumatic event followed with a reaction of intense fear, helplessness, or horror. The traumatic event is persistently reexperienced in one of these ways: recurrent distressing recollections, dreams, flashbacks, illusions, or a sense of reliving the experience, and distress or physical arousal by reminders of this event. The individual suffers from a persistent avoidance of reminders of the event. People who have been abused, victimized, or terrorized are often more susceptible to stress disorders &lt;ref&gt;Deckers Page 216&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Nevid, Spencer, and Greene, et al., 2014&lt;/ref&gt;. 
	No matter the magnitude of the stressor and stress, most stressor-stress relationships can be evaluated and determined by either the individual or a psychologist. Without proper attention, stress can produce severe effects on mental health and the immune system, which can eventually lead to effects on the physical body. Therapeutic measures are often taken to help replenish and rebuild the individual’s coping resources while simultaneously aiding the individual in dealing with the current stressor. 

'''Psychological Stressors''' 

Stressors occur when an individual is unable to cope with the demands of their environment (such as crippling debt with no clear path to resolving it).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Generally, stressors take many forms, such as: traumatic events, life demands, sudden medical emergencies, and daily inconveniences, to name a few. There are also a variety of characteristics that a stressor may possess (different durations, intensity, predictability, and controllability).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Predictability and Controllability'''

When individuals are informed about events before they occur, the magnitude of the stressor is less than when compared to individuals who were not informed of the stressor.&lt;ref&gt;Grillon, C., Baas, J. P., Lissen, S., Smith, K., &amp; Milstein, J. (2004). Anxious responses to predictable and unpredictable aversive events. Behavioral Neuroscience, 2004, 118, 916-924.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an individual would prefer to know when they have a deadline ahead of time in order to prepare for it in advance, rather than find out about the deadline the day of. In knowing that there is a deadline ahead of time, the intensity of the stressor is smaller for the individual, as opposed to the magnitude of intensity for the other unfortunate individual who found out about the deadline the day of. When this was tested, psychologists found that when given the choice, individuals had a preference for the predictable stressors, rather than the unpredictable stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Lejuez, C. W., Eifert, G. H., Zvolensky, M. J., &amp; Richards, J. B. (2000). Preference between onset predictable and unpredictable administrations of 20 percent carbon-dioxide-enriched air: Implications for better understanding the etiology and treatment of panic disorder. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 6, 349-358.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the degree to which the stressor can be controlled plays a variable in how the individual perceives stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research has found that if an individual is able to take some control over the stressor, then the level of stress will be decreased. During this study, it was found that the individuals become increasingly anxious and distressed if they were unable to control their environment.&lt;ref&gt;Zvolensky M. J., Eifert, G. H., &amp; Lejuez, C. W. (2001). Offset control during recurrent 20 percent carbon-dioxide- enriched air induction: Relation to individual difference variables. Emotion, 1, 148-165.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, imagine an individual who detests baths in the Middle Ages, taking a bath. If the individual was forced to take the bath with no control over the temperature of the bath (one of the variables), then their anxiety and stress levels would be higher than if the individual was given some control over the environment (such as being able to control the temperature of the water).

Based on these two principles (predictability and control), there are two hypotheses that attempt to account for these preferences; the preparatory response hypothesis and safety hypothesis attempt to accommodate these preferences.

'''Preparatory Response Hypothesis'''

The idea behind this hypothesis is that an organism can better prepare for an event if they are informed beforehand, as this allows them to prepare for it (biologically).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In biologically preparing for this event beforehand, the individual is able to better decrease the event's aversiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, C. C. (1955). The stimulus conditions which follow learned responses. Psychological Review, 62, 341-348.&lt;/ref&gt; In knowing when a potential stressor will occur (such as an exam), the individual could, in theory, prepare for it in advance, thus decreasing the stress that may result from that event.

'''Safety Hypothesis'''

In this hypothesis, there are two time periods, one in which is deemed safe (where there is no stressor), and one which is deemed unsafe (in which the stressor is present).&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M. E. P. (1971). Phobias and preparedness. Behavior Therapy, 2, 207-320.&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to procrastination and cramming; during the safe intervals (weeks before an exam) the individual is relaxed and not anxious, and during the unsafe intervals (the day or night before the exam) the individual most likely experiences stress and anxiety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="974">'''Subglacial streams''' are streams which flow in a channel at the bottom of an [[ice-sheet]] or a [[glacier]], and are usually close to the [[glacier terminus]] or snout. These are fed by streams on top of the glacier which descend through ducts in the ice called moulins. The pressures are very high in these streams due to the huge mass of ice above them, consequently, they have very high erosive power meaning they will increase the volume of water flowing through, maintaining the high pressure. Some subglacial streams have the strange property of 'flowing' uphill due to the colossal pressures that are present.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last1 = Moore | first1 = Peter D. | last2 = Garratt | first2 = Richard | title = Tundra | publisher = Infobase Publishing | year = 2007 | pages = 50–51 | isbn = 978-0-8160-5933-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''São Paulo State University''' ({{lang-pt|Universidade Estadual Paulista "Júlio de Mesquita Filho"}}, '''UNESP''') is one of the six public [[University|universities]] of the [[Brazil]]ian [[States of Brazil|state of]] [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] (the others are [[University of São Paulo|USP]], [[São Paulo State Technological Faculty|FATEC]], [[Universidade Estadual de Campinas|UNICAMP]], [[Universidade Federal do ABC|UFABC]], [[Universidade Federal de São Paulo|UNIFESP]]  and [[UFSCar]]). UNESP is part of the state’s higher education system and the only Brazilian member of the [[Compostela Group of Universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.usc.es/gcompostela/en/menu_superior/members/index.html|title=CGU Members|website=www2.usc.es|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESP has a combined student body of over 45,000 spread among its 23 campuses. The first of them is the Araraquara Pharmacy and Odontology Faculty, founded in 1923 and incorporated by the state of São Paulo in 1956. Before the university’s official foundation in 1976, its original 12 campuses were public independent faculties.

With a budget of R$2.6 billion in 2015, UNESP currently has 33 teaching, research and extension units in 23 campuses spread across inland and coastal cities, as well as in the city of São Paulo. It also has 30 libraries, two hospitals, three animal hospitals, five farms and seven complementary units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feg.unesp.br/Home/PaginasPessoais/profsalomon/unesp.pdf|title=Presentation about UNESP|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== History ==

Universities in Brazil are a recent phenomenon, compared to other Latin American countries. The first one was created in 1808 (Rio de Janeiro Medicine Faculty). Before the 20th century, there were no universities in the country. Existing institutions in higher education were either public or church-run independent institutes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro Federal University]] was the first one, containing every faculty inside Rio de Janeiro city in 1926. São Paulo’s first university was [[University of São Paulo|USP]], founded in 1933. By the 1950s, countryside people had to move toward capitals for undergraduate study. There were few higher education institutes outside Brazilian metropolises then.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[São Paulo state government]] created many colleges outside the capital in the 1950s and 1960s. Prominent cities in the state received these isolated institutes, known as “Faculdade de Filosofia”.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In the 1970s, discussions were made within state government on how to coordinate the separate institutes. One Suggestions was to join the 14 institutes in a federation or a single university, which was enacted on subsequently.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Inspired by the [[University of California]] multi-campus system, UNESP was founded in 1976. The original campuses were in [[Araçatuba]], [[Araraquara]], [[Assis]], [[Botucatu]], [[Franca]], [[Guaratinguetá]], [[Ilha Solteira]], [[Jaboticabal]], [[Marília]], [[Presidente Prudente, São Paulo|Presidente Prudente]], [[Rio Claro, São Paulo|Rio Claro]], [[São José dos Campos]], [[São José do Rio Preto]] and São Paulo. [[Bauru]] campus was incorporated in 1988.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The name "Universidade Estadual Paulista" was suggested by the first rector of UNESP, Professor Luiz Ferreira Martins, and the name "Júlio de Mesquita Filho" was suggested by Prof. Dr. Moacyr Expedito Marret Vaz Guimarães, then President of the State Council of Education (EEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ict.unesp.br/#!/instituicao/memorias/biografias/luis-ferreira-martins/|title=UNESP: Câmpus de São José dos Campos - Instituto de Ciência e Tecnologia|website=www.ict.unesp.br|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==
[[File:Unesp_Marília.jpg|thumb|Campus Marília]]UNESP has a total of 1,900 laboratories and 30 libraries, which together have around 900,000 books available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.unesp.br/portal#!/international/about-unesp/libraries|title=Unesp - Universidade Estadual Paulista - Portal|website=www2.unesp.br|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In addition the facilities encompass museums, gardens, parks, botanical gardens and five experimental farms, totaling an area of 62.8 million m², of which 745.4 thousand m² are developed area.

The university also owns the Hospital de Clínicas de Botucatu and manages the State Hospital of Bauru, which together have around 800 beds, as well as veterinary hospitals and dentistry, psychology, speech therapy and physiotherapy clinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.unesp.br/portal#!/international/about-unesp/history|title=Unesp - Universidade Estadual Paulista - Portal|website=www2.unesp.br|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2018}}[[File:SaoPaulo_RedeUNESP.svg|thumb|Map of the state of São Paulo with districts that are home to a campus of UNESP.]][[File:Unesp_Campus_Marília.jpg|thumb|Campus Marília]]

== Organization and administration ==
UNESP is governed by a [[Rector (academia)|rector]], appointed by the [[state governor]] who chooses the final candidate from a list of three nominees. The nominees are selected through elections, taking place among university’s academics held every four years. Usually, the governor selects the winner of those elections.{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The rector presides over the University Council, composed of directors of every institute in the system and academic representatives. There are ten students representatives. The council makes most decisions that affect the university.{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Each institute (there are campuses with more than one) has one director and a council who rules with a degree of autonomy.{{Additional citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Academics ==
UNESP employs about 3,500 teachers, in addition to another 10,600 employees in various positions. The university provides 171 options for undergraduate courses in 62 higher education professions, with a total of over 45,000 students, of which 5,600 new professionals are trained annually by UNESP. About 10,000 students study in 118 postgraduate programs, with 117 academic masters, 6 professional masters and 93 academic doctorates.

The academic year at UNESP follows a two-semester schedule, with slight differences depending on the courses and programs chosen. The spring semester runs from August - December and the fall semester from February - June.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.unesp.br/portal#!/international/campus-life/plan-a-visit|title=Unesp - Universidade Estadual Paulista - Portal|website=www2.unesp.br|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recent decade Brazil has generally become more widely recognized as a good academic environment (developing alongside the rest of the countries economy).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-09-12|title=Spotlight on Latin America|url=https://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj0389|journal=Nature Jobs|doi=10.1038/nj0389|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; But with the economic crisis some universities in Brazil have struggled in the last years; the number of publications authored and co-authored from UNESP however, has continually risen since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/brazils-subsumed-science-sector-struggles-to-stay-afloat|title=Brazil’s subsumed science sector struggles to stay afloat|website=www.natureindex.com|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Admissions ===
Admissions to UNESP are restricted by a state-wide, general admissions exam, known as ''[[vestibular]]''. For [[architecture]], [[arts]] and [[design]] undergraduate courses, additional specific exams are required.

Prepared by VUNESP, an institution specialized in exams organization, UNESP vestibular are held on three days, separated in two phases.

# The first phase consists of 90 questions in the following disciplines: [[philosophy]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[physics]] and [[English language|English]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. 
# The second phase of exams, separated in two days, is made up of specific questions in Humane and Natural Sciences on the first day. The second day of the second phase consists of specific questions in Languages (Portuguese and English or Spanish) and a writing exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/29/world/rio-journal-for-brazil-s-college-bound-a-brutal-test-of-mettle.html|title=Rio Journal; For Brazil's College-Bound, a Brutal Test of Mettle|last=Rohter|first=Larry|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A student can only apply for a single course in the São Paulo State University system, preventing a simultaneous application for e.g. History and Geography.

=== Exchange programmes ===
UNESP has 140 international exchange and cooperation agreements with institutions of higher education in 52 countries. The main exchange countries for UNESP are currently [[Argentina]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Russia]], the [[United States]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.unesp.br/portal#!/international/study|title=Unesp - Universidade Estadual Paulista - Portal|website=www2.unesp.br|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unan.unesp.br/guidaprofissoes/pdf/m14_u6_21092017-13-40-56.pdf|title=Career guide UNESP - International Exchange|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To further support international students the university launched a program called "International Courses" in 2013. The program comprised four different areas initially: [[Agricultural science|Agricultural Sciences]], [[Alternative energy|Alternative Energy]], [[Dentistry]] and [[Literature]] and [[Linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.unesp.br/portal#!/international-courses|title=Unesp - Universidade Estadual Paulista - Portal|website=www2.unesp.br|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IDF women soldiers in basic training 1954 (טירוניות בבה).jpg|250px|thumb|Women soldiers during tironut, Training Base 12, 1954]]
'''Tironut''' ({{lang-he|טירונות}}) is the [[Hebrew]] term for the [[recruit training]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF). 

There are different levels of recruit training, and each corps or major unit has their own training program. Upon completing tironut, non-combat recruits are certified as Rifleman 02.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4261231,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Combat recruits must complete Rifleman 03 basic training. Generally, infantry-specific training ranges from Rifleman 05 (combat engineering) to Rifleman 07 (infantry and combat engineers [[sapper]]s, upon completion of advanced infantry training), whereas armored or artillery corps complete Rifleman 03 training. Elite units such as [[Sayeret Matkal]] do not complete a standard basic training course for a rifleman certification and have their own extended training courses which last over one year.

All recruits in the IDF basic training wear the general all-army [[olive drab]] beret and get their corps beret upon completion, in a ceremony where the recruits swear into the IDF. Infantry units and some others such as [[Israeli Military Police|military police]] swear in at the [[Western Wall]], other units at other locations such as the Armoured Corps Memorial at [[Latrun]], the [[Western Wall]] and [[Ammunition Hill]] in [[Jerusalem]], [[Akko]] prison, training bases etc. 

==Course of the training==
At the beginning of each basic training course, there are several days of 'integration', where drill instructors convert recruits from civilians to soldiers. These are usually considered the most difficult days of any basic training program, even though they are not physically draining. During these days, recruits receive no breaks and the discipline is at its highest level.

While essentially each rifleman level and each corps training varies greatly, there are some commonalities between the entire army. All soldiers are issued weapons after their integration days and must carry them until the end of the basic training course. Many lessons are also common for all corps, such as ''moreshet krav'' (literally "battle heritage"), where soldiers are taught about past IDF operations.

Physical and verbal aggression are not permitted in the IDF basic training, which leaves drill instructors with a limited number of ways to hand out punishments. Physical punishments such as push-ups and running are common ways to punish for several discipline issues. Another method of punishment is giving detention - keeping a soldier several more days in the training base instead of visiting home; or simply delaying the visit home by a few hours. Combat units also see more group punishments, where if one soldier makes a mistake, the entire platoon suffers; although non-combat units also sometimes see this punishment. Training soldiers may avoid certain tasks or punishments with proper documents from doctors and specialists, if they see fit that the process would harm their health condition.

At the end of each basic training program, recruits swear in to the IDF and receive their corps berets, after which they go to their respective professional training courses. In most units, there is a ceremony called ''distance-breaking'', which involves the commanders telling the recruits their names, after which they are no longer these specific recruits' commanders and may call them by their first names only. In most combat units, distance-breaking is done after the professional course.

==Training bases==
*All-army (non-combat) - Rifleman 02
**[[Bahad 4|Bahad 4 (Bahar Zikim)]] (זיקים)
**Camp Yehoshu'a (a.k.a. Nitzanim) (ניצנים)
**Camp Dotan (a.k.a. Camp 80) (מחנה 80)
*Soldiers with adaptation problems (''Mak'am'') - Rifleman 02
**Havat HaShomer (חוות השומר)
*Soldiers with fewer than twelve years of general education (at the conclusion of their service period) or lack of Hebrew speaking skills - Rifleman 02
**Mikhve Elon (מחוה אלון)
*Military police - Rifleman 02
**Bahad 13
*Ordnance Corps - Rifleman 02
**Bahad 20
*Home Front Command rescue units
**[[Bahad 16]]
*Anti Aircraft - Rifleman 03
**Bisnam (ביסנ"מ - acronym of school for AA)
*Air force cadets
**Designated air force bases - Riflemen 02 Cadet / Extended&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaf.org.il/4376-38302-he/IAF.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification requirements==
Each rifleman certification has a number of requirements, although recruit training programs typically include more than what the certification requires. Some programs, such as the Extended Rifleman 02, train recruits for the next Rifleman qualification (in this case, Rifleman 03), but the recruits do not get the higher certificate.

For weapons, theoretical and practical knowledge is typically required - theoretical being the knowledge of how the gun works, the names of its parts, etc. Practical is the ability to take apart the weapon, load it, fix jams, etc. Recruits are also required to be able to hit targets with most weapons they work with.

===Rifleman 02===
*Knowledge of the [[M16 rifle|M16]] assault rifle (theory and practical)
*Ability to hit targets with the [[M16 rifle|M16]] assault rifle (out of at least fifteen bullets)
*Knowledge of the standard IDF communications equipment (theory and practical)
*Knowledge of [[first aid]] (theory)
*Knowledge of how to protect oneself against chemical and biological weapons/hazards (theory and practical)

===Rifleman 02 Cadets/ Extended===
*All Rifleman 02 requirements
*(Back when the Galil was in service) Knowledge of the [[IMI Galil]] assault rifle (theory and practical)
*Knowledge of several types of hand grenades (theory with "pakpak" grenades)
*Single and squad combat maneuvers 
*Basic field navigation (theory and practical) - "field week"
*Knowledge of radio equipment operation (MK 77)

'''''Treatise on the Gods''''' (1930) is [[H. L. Mencken]]'s survey of the history and philosophy of [[religion]], and was intended as an unofficial companion volume to his [[Treatise on Right and Wrong]] (1934).&lt;ref&gt;https://openlibrary.org/b/OL14380373M/Treatise_on_right_and_wrong&lt;/ref&gt; The first and second printings were sold out before publication, and eight more printings followed.&lt;ref&gt;''Treatise on the Gods'', preface to the Revised Edition&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first edition received a major 5-column review in the ''[[New York Times]]'', written by one P.W. Wilson;&lt;ref&gt;See the NYT online archive&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Marxism|Marxist]] literary critic [[Granville Hicks]] called it "the best popular account we have of the origin and nature of religion." However, the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] theologian [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], writing in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', claimed that "It is only in dealing with moral and social issues that [Mencken] achieves the heights of complete detachment, and in this case the detachment is that of a cynic rather than that of a scientist." By the end of its first year ''Treatise'' had sold thirteen thousand copies.&lt;ref&gt;''The Skeptic: A Life of H. L. Mencken'', by [[Terry Teachout]]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940 its popularity had waned, and although it went temporarily out of print in 1945, Mencken considered it "my best book, and by far."&lt;ref&gt;''The Skeptic: A Life of H. L. Mencken'', by [[Terry Teachout]]&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of its original publisher [[Alfred A Knopf]], Mencken wrote a revised edition (1946), eliminating (among other changes) a controversial quote about [[Jews]]:

:The Jews could be put down very plausibly as the most unpleasant race ever heard of. As commonly encountered, they lack many of the qualities that mark the civilized man: courage, dignity, incorruptibility, ease, confidence. They have vanity without pride, voluptuousness without taste, and learning without wisdom. Their fortitude, such as it is, is wasted upon puerile objects, and their charity is mainly a form of display.&lt;ref&gt;''Treatise on the Gods'', 1930, pp. 345–46&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after publication the ''[[New York Times]]'' published another review, this one by [[Philip Wylie]] and accompanied by a [[caricature]] of Mencken by [[Miguel Covarrubias|Covarrubias]]. Wylie referred to the book as a "[[Tourbillon (disambiguation)|tourbillon]] by the [[Burgrave]] of [[Baltimore]]". Two more editions of the book followed, in 1997 and 2006.

[[Image:Solvognen-00100.tif|thumb|280px|The gilded side of the Trundholm sun chariot.]]
[[Image:Solvognen Do 2010 1278.tif|thumb|280px|The left side of the disk shows no traces of gilding.]]

The '''Trundholm sun chariot''' ({{lang-da|Solvognen}}), is a [[Nordic Bronze Age]] artifact discovered in [[Denmark]]. It is a representation of the  [[sun chariot]],  a [[bronze]] statue of a [[horse]] and a large bronze disk, which are placed on a device with spoked [[wheels]].

The sculpture was discovered with no accompanying objects in 1902 in a [[peat bog]] on the Trundholm moor in [[Odsherred]] in the northwestern part of [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], (approximately {{Coord|55|55|N|11|37|E|}}). It is now in the collection of the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]].

==Description==
The horse stands on a bronze rod supported by four wheels. The rod below the horse is connected to the disk, which is supported by two wheels. All of the wheels have four [[spoke]]s.  The artifact was cast in the [[Lost-wax casting|lost wax]] method.

The whole object is approximately {{convert|54|x|35|x|29|cm|in|abbr=on}} in size (width, height, depth).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsbutikken.dk/default.aspx?load=main&amp;Data=ProductInfo&amp;key=180029&amp;group=kopier2 Nationalmuseet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The disk has a diameter of approximately {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}}. It is gilded on one side only, the right-hand side (when looking at the horse from behind). It consists of two bronze disks that are joined by an outer bronze ring, with a thin sheet of gold applied to one face. The disks were then decorated with punches and gravers with zones of motifs of concentric circles, with bands of zig-zag decoration between borders.  The gold side has an extra outer zone which may represent rays, and also a zone with concentric circles linked by looping bands that "instead of flowing in one direction, progress like the steps of the dance, twice forward and once back".  The main features of the horse are also highly decorated.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 184-185&lt;/ref&gt;

The two sides of the disk have been interpreted as an indication of a belief that the [[sun]] is drawn across the heavens from East to West during the day, presenting its bright side to the Earth and returns from West to East during the night, when the dark side is being presented to the Earth. A continuation around a globe would have the same result.  It is thought that the chariot was pulled around during religious rituals to demonstrate the motion of the sun in the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 184; see also Nationalmuseet video&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
The sculpture is dated by the National Museum to about 1400 BC,&lt;ref&gt;http://natmus.dk/historisk-viden/danmark/oldtid-indtil-aar-1050/bronzealderen-1700-fkr-500-fkr/solvognen/&lt;/ref&gt; though other dates have been suggested. It was found before pollen-dating was developed, which would have enabled a more confident dating.

A model of a [[horse-drawn vehicle]] on spoked wheels in Northern Europe at such an early time is surprising; they would not be expected to appear until the end of the Late Bronze Age, which ranges from 1100 BC to 550 BC.  This and aspects of the decoration may suggest a Danubian origin or influence in the object, although the Nationalmuseet is confident it is of Nordic origin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719103334/http://www.nationalmuseet.dk/sw59869.asp Nationalmuseet video]; Sandars, 183-185 favours Danubian influence, and a date at the end of the 13th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible function as a calendar==
[[File:Trundholm sun chariot animation.gif|thumb|Rotating image]] 
Klaus Randsborg, professor of archeology at the [[University of Copenhagen]],  has pointed out that the sum of an addition of the number of spirals in each circle of the disk, multiplied by the number of the circles in which they are found, counted from the middle (1x1 + 2x8 + 3x20 + 4x25), results in a total of 177, which comes very close to the number of days in six [[synodic]] months, only 44 min 2.8 s shorter each.

The [[synodic cycle]] is the time that elapses between two successive conjunctions of an object in the sky, such as a specific star, with the sun. It is the time that elapses before the object will reappear at the same point in the sky when observed from the Earth, so it is the ''apparent'' orbital period observed from Earth.

He asserts his belief that this demonstrates that the disk was designed by a person with some measure of astronomic knowledge and that the sculpture may have functioned as a calendar.

==Sun chariot in Indo-European mythology==
{{main|Sun chariot}}

===Norse mythology===

The chariot has  been interpreted as a possible [[Bronze Age]] predecessor to [[Skinfaxi]],&lt;ref name=LINDOW272&gt;[[John Lindow|Lindow, John]]. (2001) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KlT7tv3eMSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs]'', page 272. [[Oxford University Press]] {{ISBN|0-19-515382-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the horse that pulled [[Dagr]], the personification of day, across the sky.

===Celtic Pantheon===
The sky god [[Taranis]] is typically depicted with the attribute of a spoked wheel.

===Rigveda===
[[File:Surya chariot.jpg|thumb|right|Surya's chariot]]
{{Main|Historical Vedic religion}}
The [[Rigveda]] also reflects the mytheme of the Sun chariot. [[Mandala 10|RV 10]].85 mentions the sun god's bride as  seated on a chariot pulled by two steeds.
The relevant verses are the following (trans.  Griffith):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
10. Her spirit was the bridal car; the covering thereof was heaven:
     Bright were both Steeds that drew it when [[Surya]] approached her husband's home.&lt;br&gt;
11. Thy Steeds were steady, kept in place by holy verse and Sama-hymn:
     All car were thy two chariot wheels: thy path was tremulous in the sky,&lt;br&gt;
12. Clean, as thou wentest, were thy wheels, wind was the axle fastened there.
     Surya, proceeding to her Lord, mounted a spirit-fashioned car.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Rig Veda|book=Mandala 10/Hymn 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
