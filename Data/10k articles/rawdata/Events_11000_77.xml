The '''2002 Rome summit''' was an exceptional (and thus unnumbered) [[NATO summit]] of NATO and Russia at the level of Heads of State and Government. [[NATO]] Allies and the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] created the [[NATO–Russia relations|NATO–Russia Council]], which replaced the NATO–Russia Permanent Joint Council. The summit was held in the [[Pratica di Mare Air Base]] outside [[Rome]] because of outstanding security requirements soon after the [[september 11 attacks|9/11]] attacks.

There are many [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] that attribute the planning and execution of the [[September 11 attacks]] against the [[United States]] to parties other than, or in addition to, [[al-Qaeda]]&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;{{cite web  | author=Norman, Joshua  | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/9-11-conspiracy-theories-wont-stop/  | title=9/11 conspiracy theories won't stop | publisher=[[CBS News]]  |date=September 11, 2011 | accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including that there was [[September 11 attacks advance-knowledge conspiracy theories|advance knowledge of the attacks]] among high-level government officials. Government investigations and independent reviews have rejected these theories.&lt;ref name=popularmechanics.com /&gt;&lt;ref name=Purdue /&gt; Proponents of these theories assert that there are inconsistencies in the commonly accepted version, or evidence that was either ignored or overlooked.&lt;ref name=VF&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vanityfair.com/ontheweb/features/2006/08/loosechange200608 | title=Click Here For Conspiracy | author=Sales, Nancy Jo | publisher=Vanity Fair | date=July 9, 2006 | accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent conspiracy theory is that the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse of the Twin Towers]] and [[7 World Trade Center]] were the [[World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theories|result of controlled demolitions]] rather than structural failure due to impact and fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Summers | first=Anthony | title=The Eleventh Day: The Full Story of 9/11 and Osama bin Laden | year=2011 | publisher=Ballantine | location=New York | isbn=978-1-4000-6659-9 | page=104 | author2=Swan, Robbyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Staff Editors | date = February 3, 2005 | title = Debunking the 9/11 Myths: Special Report – The World Trade Center | journal = Popular Mechanics| publisher = Hearst Communication | url = http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/news/debunking-911-myths-world-trade-center | quote = That explanation hasn't swayed conspiracy theorists, who contend that all three buildings were wired with explosives in advance and razed in a series of controlled demolitions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent belief is that [[the Pentagon]] was hit by a missile launched by elements from inside the U.S. government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Summers | first=Anthony | title=The Eleventh Day: The Full Story of 9/11 and Osama bin Laden|year=2011 | publisher=Ballantine | location=New York | isbn=978-1-4000-6659-9|page=109 | author2=Swan, Robbyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usgovDidPlaneHitPentagon" /&gt; or that a commercial airliner was allowed to do so via an effective stand-down of the American military.

== Background ==
9/11 conspiracy theorists reject one or both of the following facts about the 9/11 attacks:

* [[Al-Qaeda]] suicide operatives hijacked and crashed [[United Airlines Flight 175]] and [[American Airlines Flight 11]] into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, and crashed [[American Airlines Flight 77]] into the Pentagon. The impact and resulting fires caused the collapse of the Twin Towers and the destruction and damage of other buildings in the World Trade Center complex. The Pentagon was severely damaged by the impact of the airliner and the resulting fire. The hijackers also crashed [[United Airlines Flight 93|a fourth plane]] into a field near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]] after the passengers and flight crew attempted to regain control of the aircraft.{{refn|&lt;ref name="investigation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="finalreport"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Flight93Story'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/flni/historyculture/index.htm | title = The Flight 93 Story |accessdate=September 22, 2011 | publisher = National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/profiles-of-9-11/about911.jsp |title=Profiles of 9/11 – About 9/11 |publisher=Biography.com |date=September 11, 2001 |accessdate=July 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716140728/http://www.biography.com/profiles-of-9-11/about911.jsp |archivedate=July 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* Pre-attack warnings of varying detail of the planned attacks against the United States by al-Qaeda were ignored due to a lack of communication between various law enforcement and intelligence personnel. For the lack of interagency communication, the 9/11 report cited bureaucratic inertia and laws passed in the 1970s to prevent abuses that caused scandals during that era, most notably the [[Watergate scandal]]. The report faulted both the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton]] and the [[Presidency of George W.

The first elaborated theories appeared in Europe. One week after the attacks, the "inside job" theory was the subject of a thesis by a researcher from the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] published in ''[[Le Monde]]''. Other theories sprang from the far corners of the globe within weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Summers|first=Anthony|title=The Eleventh Day: The Full Story of 9/11 and Osama bin Laden|year=2011|publisher=Ballantine|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4000-6659-9|page=95|author2=Swan, Robbyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months after the attacks, [[Thierry Meyssan]]'s piece on 9/11, ''L'Effroyable Imposture'', topped the French bestseller list.

The 9/11 conspiracy theories started out mostly in the political left but have broadened into what ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine describes as "[[terra incognita]] where left and right meet, fusing [[Counterculture of the 1960s|sixties countercultural]] distrust with the [[Gadsden flag|don't-tread-on-me]] variety".&lt;ref name=StrangeMan&gt;{{cite web|last=Hagan |first=Joe |url=http://nymag.com/news/media/alex-jones-2011-4/ |title=How Radio Host Alex Jones Has Cornered the Bipartisan Paranoia Market |publisher=New York Magazine |date=March 27, 2011 |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2004, conspiracy theories about the September 11 attacks began to gain ground in the United States. One explanation is that the rise in popularity stemmed more from growing criticism of the [[Iraq War]] and the newly re-elected President George W. Bush than from any discovery of new or more compelling evidence or an improvement in the technical quality of the presentation of the theories.&lt;ref name="Knight" /&gt; [[Knight Ridder|Knight Ridder news]] theorized that revelations that [[weapons of mass destruction]] did not exist in Iraq, the belated release of the [[President's Daily Brief of August 6, 2001]], and reports that [[NORAD]] had lied to the [[9/11 Commission]], may have fueled the conspiracy theories.&lt;ref name="Knight" /&gt;

Between 2004 and the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2006, mainstream coverage of the conspiracy theories increased.&lt;ref name="Knight" /&gt; The U.S. government issued a formal analysis by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) of the collapse of the World Trade Center.&lt;ref name="nistfaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm |title=NIST's Investigation of the Sept. 11 World Trade Center Disaster – Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Wtc.nist.gov |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address the growing publicity of the theories, the [[State Department]] revised a webpage in 2006 to debunk them.&lt;ref name="usgovTopConspiracyTheories"&gt;{{cite web

Some of the conspiracy theories about the September 11 attacks do not involve representational strategies typical of many conspiracy theories that establish a clear dichotomy between good and evil, or guilty and innocent; instead, they call up gradations of negligence and complicity. Matthias Bröckers, an early proponent of such theories, dismisses the commonly accepted account of the September 11 attacks as being itself a conspiracy theory that seeks "to reduce complexity, disentangle what is confusing," and "explain the inexplicable".&lt;ref name="Knight" /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to the German daily ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', the videos that were published shortly before the ninth anniversary of the attacks provide "new food for conspiracy theorists." Many of the videos show images of [[7 World Trade Center]], a skyscraper in the vicinity of the WTC towers that also [[Collapse of the World Trade Center#Collapse of 7 World Trade Center|collapsed]] on September 11, 2001.&lt;ref name="FAZ Videos"&gt;

According to writer Jeremy Stahl, since Bush left office, the overall number of believers in 9/11 conspiracy theories has dipped, while the number of people who believe in the most "radical" theories has held fairly steady.&lt;ref name=Stahl&gt;Stahl, Jeremy. [http://www.slate.com/id/2302853/ "Why Trutherism Lives On The 9/11 conspiracy movement has faded, but the conspiracy theory will never die"]. ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. September 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The most prominent conspiracy theories can be broadly divided into three main forms:
* LIHOP ("Let it happen on purpose") – suggests that key individuals within the government had at least some foreknowledge of the attacks and deliberately ignored it or actively weakened United States' defenses to ensure the hijacked flights were not intercepted.&lt;ref name=VF/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Eleventh Day pp92" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCevolution"/&gt; [[Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory|Similar allegations]] were made about [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]].
* MIHOP ("Make/Made it happen on purpose") – that key individuals within the government planned the attacks and collaborated with, or framed, al-Qaeda in carrying them out. There is a range of opinions about how this might have been achieved.&lt;ref name=VF/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Eleventh Day pp92" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCevolution" /&gt;
* Others – who reject the accepted account of the September 11 attacks are not proposing specific theories, but try to demonstrate that the U.S. government's account of the events is wrong. This, according to them, would lead to a general call for a new official investigation into the events of September 11, 2001. According to Jonathan Kay, managing editor for comment at the Canadian newspaper ''[[National Post]]''&lt;ref name="Kay Nashville"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kay|first=Jonathan|journal=Newsweek|title=Black Helicopters Over Nashville|date=February 9, 2010|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/233331/page/2|accessdate=March 14, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100213061042/http://www.newsweek.com/id/233331/page/2| archivedate=February 13, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author of the ''[[Among the Truthers|Among the Truthers: A Journey Through America's Growing Conspiracist Underground]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weigel |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2292081/pagenum/all/#p2 |title=You're All Nuts!

== Theories ==
=== Foreknowledge ===
{{See also|U.S. military response during the September 11 attacks|United States government operations and exercises on September 11, 2001}}

Conspiracy theorists claim that action or inaction by U.S. officials with foreknowledge was intended to ensure that the attacks took place successfully. For example, [[Michael Meacher]], former British environment minister and member of [[Tony Blair]]'s government, said that the United States knowingly failed to prevent the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/sep/06/september11.iraq |title=Michael Meacher: This war on terrorism is bogus Politics |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=July 20, 2009 |date=December 4, 2003| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090715133257/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/sep/06/september11.iraq| archivedate=July 15, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/sep/06/uk.iraq |title=Meacher sparks fury over claims on September 11 and Iraq war Politics |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=July 20, 2009 |first=Ewen |last=MacAskill |date=September 6, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Suspected insider trading ====
Some conspiracy theorists maintain that just before 9/11, an "extraordinary" amount of [[put option]]s were placed on [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] stocks and speculate that insiders may have known in advance of the coming events of 9/11 and placed their bets accordingly. An analysis into the possibility of [[insider trading]] on 9/11 concludes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A measure of abnormal long put volume was also examined and seen to be at abnormally high levels in the days leading up to the attacks. Consequently, the paper concludes that there is evidence of unusual option market activity in the days leading up to September 11 that is consistent with investors trading on advance knowledge of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Unusual Option Market Activity and the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 | journal = [[The Journal of Business]] | year = 2006 | first = Allen M. | page = 1703 | last = Poteshman | volume = 79 | issue = 4| doi = 10.1086/503645 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

—Allen M. Poteshman, ''[[The Journal of Business]]''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This study was intended to address the "great deal of speculation about whether option market activity indicated that the terrorists or their associates had traded in the days leading up to September 11 on advance knowledge of the impending attacks."&lt;ref&gt;"Unusual Option Market Activity and the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001", Allen M. Poteshman The Journal of Business Vol. 79, No. 4 (July 2006), pp. 1703–1726&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days leading up to 9/11, analysis shows a rise in the put to call ratio for United Airlines and American Airlines, the two airlines from which planes were hijacked on 9/11. Between September 6 and 7, the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] recorded purchases of 4,744 "put" option contracts in UAL and 396 call options. On September 10, more trading in Chicago saw the purchase of 4,516 put options in American Airlines, the other airline involved in the hijackings, with a mere 748 call options in American purchased that day. No other airline companies has unusual put to  call ratio in the days leading up to the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/mystery-of-terror-insider-dealers-631325.html |location=London |work=The Independent |title=Mystery of terror 'insider dealers' |first=Chris |last=Blackhurst |date=October 14, 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310025104/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/mystery-of-terror-insider-dealers-631325.html |archivedate=March 10, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 9/11 Commission concluded that all these abnormal patterns in trading were coincidental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/rumors/putcall.asp | title=September 11 Put Call | work=[[Snopes]] | date=11 December 2005 | accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insurance companies saw anomalous trading activities as well. [[Citigroup Inc.]], which has estimated that its [[Travelers Insurance]] unit may pay $500 million in claims from the World Trade Center attack, had about 45 times the normal volume during three trading days before the attack for options that profit, if the stock falls below $40. Citigroup shares fell $1.25 in late trading to $38.09. [[Morgan Stanley]], which occupied 22 floors at the World Trade Center, experienced bigger-than-normal pre-attack trading of options that profited when stock prices fell. Other companies directly affected by the tragedy had similar jumps.&lt;ref&gt;BLOOMBERG NEWS, September 20, 2001 ''SEC asks Goldman, Lehman for data''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raytheon]], a defense contractor, had an anomalously high number of call options trading on September 10. A Raytheon option that makes money, if shares are more than $25 each had 232 options contracts traded on the day before the attacks, almost six times the total number of trades that had occurred before that day.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The initial options were bought through at least two [[brokerage firm]]s, including [[Fidelity Investments#Mutual funds and stock brokerage|NFS]], a subsidiary of [[Fidelity Investments]], and [[TD Waterhouse]]. It was estimated that the trader or traders would have realized a five million dollar profit. The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] launched an [[insider trading]] investigation in which [[Osama bin Laden]] was a suspect after receiving information from at least one Wall Street Firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/09/19/eveningnews/main311834.shtml |title=Profiting From Disaster? |publisher=CBS News – 60&amp;nbsp;Minutes |date=September 19, 2001 |accessdate=October 15, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100924195744/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/09/19/eveningnews/main311834.shtml| archivedate=September 24, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[9/11 Commission Report]] concluded that "Exhaustive investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, FBI, and other agencies have uncovered no evidence that anyone with advance knowledge of the attacks profited through securities transactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf |title=Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |page=172 |accessdate=2015-07-20 |date=2004-07-22 |publisher=9-11commission.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report further stated:

{{quote|text=Highly publicized allegations of insider trading in advance of 9/11 generally rest on reports of unusual pre-9/11 trading activity in companies whose stock plummeted after the attacks. Some unusual trading did in fact occur, but each such trade proved to have an innocuous explanation. For example, the volume of put options — investments that pay off only when a stock drops in price — surged in the parent companies of United Airlines on September 6 and American Airlines on September 10 — highly suspicious trading on its face. Yet, further investigation has revealed that the trading had no connection with 9/11. A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included ''buying'' 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9, which recommended these trades. These examples typify the evidence examined by the investigation. The SEC and the FBI, aided by other agencies and the securities industry, devoted enormous resources to investigating this issue, including securing the cooperation of many foreign governments. These investigators have found that the apparently suspicious consistently proved innocuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2004-07-22 |title=Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |publisher=9-11commission.gov |page=499 |url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Air defense stand down theory ====
A common claim among conspiracy theorists is that the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) issued a stand down order or deliberately scrambled fighters late to allow the hijacked airplanes to reach their targets without interference. According to this theory, NORAD had the capability of locating and intercepting planes on 9/11, and its failure to do so indicates a government conspiracy to allow the attacks to occur.{{sfn|Molé|2006}} Conspiracy theorist Mark R. Elsis says: "There is only one explanation for this&amp;nbsp;...

One of the first actions taken by the hijackers on 9/11 was to turn off or disable each of the four aircraft's on board transponders. Without these transponder signals to identify the airplane's tail number, altitude, and speed, the hijacked airplanes would have been only blips among 4,500 other blips on NORAD's radar screens, making them very difficult to track.{{sfn|Dunbar|Reagan|2011|p=33}}{{sfn|Molé|2006}}

On 9/11, only 14 fighter jets were on alert in the contiguous 48 states. There was no automated method for the civilian air traffic controllers to alert NORAD.{{sfn|Dunbar|Reagan|2011|p=32}} A passenger airline had not been hijacked in the U.S. since 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |medium=Television production|title = 9/11: The Conspiracy Files |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/conspiracy_files/6160775.stm |publisher = [[BBC News]] |airdate = February 18, 2007 |accessdate=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "They had to pick up the phone and literally dial us," says Maj. Douglas Martin, public affairs officer for NORAD. Only one civilian plane—a [[1999 South Dakota Learjet crash|chartered Learjet 35]] with golfer Payne Stewart and five others on board—was intercepted by NORAD over North America in the decade prior to 9/11, which took one hour and 19&amp;nbsp;minutes.{{sfn|Dunbar|Reagan|2011|p=38}}

Rules in effect at that time, and on 9/11, barred supersonic flight on intercepts. Before 9/11, all other NORAD interceptions were limited to offshore [[Air Defense Identification Zone (North America)|Air Defense Identification Zones]] (ADIZ). "Until 9/11 there was no domestic ADIZ," says FAA spokesman Bill Schumann. After 9/11, the FAA and NORAD increased cooperation. They set up hotlines between command centers while NORAD increased its fighter coverage and installed radar to watch airspace over the continent.&lt;ref name="popularmechanics.com" /&gt;

The longest warning NORAD received of the hijackings was some eight minutes for American Airlines Flight 11, the first flight hijacked. The FAA alerted NORAD to the hijacked Flight 175 at just about the same time it was crashing into the World Trade Center's South Tower. The FAA notified NORAD of the missing – not hijacked – Flight 77 three minutes before it struck the Pentagon. NORAD received no warning of the hijack of United Flight 93 until three minutes after it had crashed in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Summers|first=Anthony|title=The Eleventh Day: The Full Story of 9/11 and Osama bin Laden|year=2011|publisher=Ballantine|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4000-6659-9|pages=123-|author2=Swan, Robbyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Israeli agents ====

It has been claimed that [[Mossad|Israeli agents]] may have had foreknowledge of the attacks. Four hours after the attack, the FBI arrested five Israelis who had been filming the smoking skyline from the roof of a white van in the parking lot of an apartment building, for "puzzling behavior." The Israelis were videotaping the events, and one bystander said they acted in a suspicious manner: "They were like happy, you know&amp;nbsp;... They didn't look shocked to me.

=== World Trade Center ===
{{See also|World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theories}}
[[File:NIST 7 WTC Exterior buckling.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Criticism of the reports published by [[NIST]] on the destruction of the World Trade Center buildings plays a central role in theories about an alleged controlled demolition. The picture shows the simulated exterior buckling of [[7 World Trade Center|7 WTC]] during the collapse.]]

The plane crashes and resulting fires caused the [[collapse of the World Trade Center]]. [[World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theories|Controlled demolition conspiracy theories]] say the collapse of the North Tower, South Tower, or of [[7 World Trade Center]] was caused by explosives installed in the buildings in advance.

Demolition theory proponents, such as [[Brigham Young University]] physicist [[Steven E. Jones]], architect [[Richard Gage (architect)|Richard Gage]], software engineer [[Jim Hoffman]], and theologian [[David Ray Griffin]], argue that the aircraft impacts and resulting fires could not have weakened the buildings sufficiently to initiate a catastrophic collapse, and that the buildings would not have collapsed completely, nor at the speeds that they did, without additional factors weakening the structures.

In the article "Active Thermotic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe", which appeared in the ''Open Chemical Physics Journal'', authors Niels Harrit of the [[University of Copenhagen]]'s Department of Chemistry, Jeffrey Farrer of [[Brigham Young University]]'s Department of Physics and Astronomy, Steven E. Jones, and others state that [[thermite]] and [[nano-thermite]] composites in the dust and debris were found following the collapse of the three buildings. The article contained no scientific rebuttal and the editor in chief of the publication subsequently resigned.&lt;ref name=NYTCountersTheories&gt;{{Cite news | author=Jim Dwyer | title=2 U.S. Reports Seek to Counter Conspiracy Theories About 9/11 | date=September 2, 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/02/nyregion/02conspiracy.html | accessdate=2009-04-30 | work=The New York Times | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110512221337/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/02/nyregion/02conspiracy.html | archivedate=2011-05-12&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deseret-Dean-2006"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dean |first=Suzanne |journal=Deseret Morning News |title=Physicist says heat substance felled WTC |date=2006-04-10 |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,635198488,00.html |accessdate=2009-05-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510002116/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1%2C5143%2C635198488%2C00.html |archivedate=May 10, 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Barber | first=Peter | date=2008-07-08 | journal=Financial Times | title=The truth is out there | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8d66e778-3128-11dd-ab22-000077b07658.html | accessdate=2009-05-23 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090603164130/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8d66e778-3128-11dd-ab22-000077b07658.html | archivedate=2009-06-03&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones has not explained how the amount of explosive needed  to bring down the buildings could have been positioned in the two buildings without drawing attention, but mentioned efforts to research the buildings' maintenance activity in the weeks prior to the event. Federal investigators at the National Institute of Standards and Technology state that enormous quantities of thermite would have to be applied to the structural columns to damage them, but Jones disputed this, saying that he and others were investigating "superthermite".&lt;ref name=NYTCountersTheories/&gt; Brent Blanchard, author of "A History of Explosive Demolition in America",&lt;ref name=HEDA&gt;{{cite conference | author = Brent Blanchard | title = A History of Explosive Demolition in America | booktitle = Proceedings of the Annual Conference on Explosives and Blasting Technique | pages = 27–44 | date=February 2002 | ISSN =0732-619X | publisher = International Society of Explosives Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt; who corresponded with Jones, states that questions about the viability of Jones' theories remain unanswered, such as the fact that no demolition personnel noticed any telltale signs of thermite during the eight months of debris removal following the towers' collapse. Blanchard also said that a verifiable chain of possession needs to be established for the tested beams, which did not occur with the beams Jones tested, raising questions of whether the metal pieces tested could have been cut away from the debris pile with acetylene torches, shears, or other potentially contaminated equipment while on site, or exposed to trace amounts of thermite or other compounds while being handled, while in storage, or while being transferred from Ground Zero to memorial sites.

Jones also said that molten steel found in the rubble was evidence of explosives, as an ordinary airplane fire would not generate enough heat to produce this, citing photographs of red debris being removed by construction equipment, but Blanchard said that if there had been any molten steel in the rubble any excavation equipment encountering it would have been immediately damaged.&lt;ref name=NYTCountersTheories/&gt; Other sampling of the pulverized dust by [[United States Geological Survey]] and RJ Lee did not report any evidence of thermite or explosives.

August 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Thomas of ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine, noting that the residue in question was claimed to be thermotic because of its iron oxide and aluminum composition, pointed out that these substances are found in many items common to the towers. Thomas said that in order to cut through a vertical steel beam, special high-temperature containment must be added to prevent the molten iron from dropping down, and that the thermite reaction is too slow for it to be practically used in building demolition. Thomas pointed out that when [[Jesse Ventura]] hired [[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology|New Mexico Tech]] to conduct a demonstration showing nanothermite slicing through a large steel beam, the nanothermite produced copious flame and smoke but no damage to the beam, even though it was in a horizontal, and therefore optimal position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Thomas | first1=Dave | title=The 9/11 Truth Movement: The Top Conspiracy Theory, a Decade Later | journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] | date=July–August 2011 | pages=34–40 | volume=35 | issue=4 | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_9_11_truth_movement_the_top_conspiracy_theory_a_decade_later/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) concluded the accepted version was more than sufficient to explain the collapse of the buildings.

Knowledge that the burning temperatures of jet fuel would not melt the steel support structure of the WTC contributed to the belief among skeptics that the towers would not have collapsed without external interference (something other than the planes).

Political activist [[Thierry Meyssan]] and filmmaker [[Dylan Avery]] claim that [[American Airlines Flight 77]] did not crash into [[the Pentagon]]. Instead, they argue that the Pentagon was hit by a missile launched by elements from inside the U.S. government. Some claim that the holes in the Pentagon walls were far too small to have been made by a Boeing 757: "How does a plane 125&amp;nbsp;ft. wide and 155&amp;nbsp;ft. long fit into a hole which is only 60&amp;nbsp;ft. across?" Meyssan's book, ''L'Effroyable Imposture'' (published in English as ''9/11: The Big Lie'') became available in more than a dozen languages. When released, the book was heavily criticized by both the mainstream French and American press, and later, from within the [[9/11 Truth movement]]. The French newspaper ''Liberation'' called the book "a tissue of wild and irresponsible allegations, entirely without foundation."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |last=Editors |first=The |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/1227842.html?do=print |title=Popular Mechanics |publisher=Popular Mechanics |accessdate=July 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329153037/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/1227842.html?do=print |archivedate=March 29, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/01/september11.france |title=US invented air attack on Pentagon, claims French book |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Jon |last=Henley |date=April 12, 2002 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090617172525/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/apr/01/september11.france |archivedate=June 17, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ConspiracyTheoristsDownButNotOut"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4990686.stm |title=Conspiracy theorists down but not out |author=Paul Reynolds |date=May 16, 2006 |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=September 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the conspiracy theorists' claim of a missile hitting the Pentagon, Mete Sozen, a professor of civil engineering at [[Purdue University]] argues that: "A crashing jet doesn't punch a cartoon-like outline of itself into a reinforced concrete building.

Evidence contradicting some conspiracy theorists' claim of a missile hitting the Pentagon have been described by researchers within the 9/11 Truth Movement, such as Jim Hoffman, in his essay "The Pentagon Attack: What the Physical Evidence Shows", and by others broadly refuting the role of other conspiracies in the attacks.

Further, Flight 77 passengers made phone calls reporting that their airplane had been hijacked.

Another passenger named [[Barbara Olson]] called her husband (U.S. Solicitor General [[Theodore Olson]]) and said that the flight had been hijacked, and that the hijackers had [[knives]] and [[box cutters]].&lt;ref name="usgovDidPlaneHitPentagon"&gt;{{cite web

=== Flight 93 ===
[[File:UA93 crash site.jpg|thumb|left|Flight 93 crash site]]

The fourth plane hijacked on 9/11, [[United Airlines Flight 93]], crashed in an open field near [[Shanksville]], [[Pennsylvania]], after the passengers revolted. Out of the four planes hijacked on that day, Flight 93 was the only one not to reach its target.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/conspiracy_files/6341851.stm#8 |title=Programmes &amp;#124; Conspiracy Files &amp;#124; Q&amp;A: What really happened |publisher=BBC News |date=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the popular conspiracy theories surrounding this event is that Flight 93 was actually shot down by a U.S. fighter jet. [[David Ray Griffin]] and [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]] say that large parts of the plane including the main body of the engine landed miles away from the main wreckage site, too far away for an ordinary plane crash. Jones says that planes usually leave a small debris field when they crash, and that this is not compatible with reports of wreckage found farther away from the main crash site. One person claimed that the main body of the engine was found miles away from the main wreckage site with damage comparable to that which a heat-seeking missile would do to an airliner.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /&gt;

According to some theories, the plane had to be shot down by the government because passengers had found out about the alleged plot.&lt;ref name="women.timesonline.co.uk"/&gt;

According to Phil Molé of ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' magazine, "[this] claim rests largely on unsupported assertions that the main body of the engine and other large parts of the plane turned up miles from the main wreckage site, too far away to have resulted from an ordinary crash. This claim is incorrect, because the engine was found only 300&amp;nbsp;yards from the main crash site, and its location was consistent with the direction in which the plane had been traveling."&lt;ref name="skepticMagazine"&gt;{{cite web |last=Molé |first=Phil |url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/06-09-11 |title=The Skeptics Society &amp; Skeptic magazine |publisher=Skeptic |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael K. Hynes, an airline accident expert who investigated the crash of [[TWA Flight 800]] in 1996, says that, at very high velocities of 500&amp;nbsp;mph or more, it would only take a few seconds to move or tumble across the ground for 300&amp;nbsp;yards.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skepticMagazine"/&gt;

Reports of wreckage discovered at Indian Lake by local residents are accurate. CNN reported that investigators found debris from the crash at least eight miles away from the crash site, including in [[New Baltimore, Pennsylvania|New Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=CNN|title='Black box' from Pennsylvania crash found|date=September 13, 2001|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/09/13/penn.attack/|accessdate=July 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to CNN, this debris was all very light material that the wind would have easily blown away, and a ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' article from September 14, 2001, describes the material as "mostly papers", "strands of charred insulation", and an "endorsed paycheck". The same article quotes FBI agent Bill Crowley that, "Lighter, smaller debris probably shot into the air on the heat of a fireball that witnesses said shot several hundred feet into the air after the jetliner crashed. Then, it probably rode a wind that was blowing southeast at about 9&amp;nbsp;m.p.h."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=James |last=O'Toole |author2=Tom Gibb|author3=Cindi Lash |title=Flight data recorder may hold clues to suicide flight |date=September 14, 2001 |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/headlines/20010914scene0914p2.asp |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the distance between the crash site and Indian Lake was misreported in some accounts. According to the BBC, "In a straight line, Indian Lake is just over a mile from the crash site. The road between the two locations takes a roundabout route of 6.9&amp;nbsp;miles—accounting for the erroneous reports."&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /&gt;

Some conspiracy theorists believe a small white jet seen flying over the crash area may have fired a missile to shoot down Flight 93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/defense/1227842.html?page=7 |title=Flight 93 |accessdate=July 12, 2009 |date=March 2005 |work=Debunking the 9/11 Myths: Special Report |publisher=Popular Mechanics |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704084428/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/defense/1227842.html?page=7 |archivedate=July 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious| reason=In the reference, no one specifically theorizes that the "small white jet" observed by witnesses committed a shootdown.

Some internet videos, such as ''[[Loose Change (film series)|Loose Change]]'', speculate that Flight 93 safely landed in [[Ohio]], and a substituted plane was involved in the crash in Pennsylvania. Often cited is a preliminary news report that Flight 93 landed at a [[Cleveland]] airport;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/06-09-11|title=9/11 Conspiracy Theories: The 9/11 Truth Movement in Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was later learned that Delta Flight 1989 was the plane confused with Flight 93, and the report was retracted as inaccurate. Several websites within the 9/11 Truth Movement dispute this claim, citing the wreckage at the scene, eyewitness testimony, and the difficulty of secretly substituting one plane for another, and claim that such "hoax theories&amp;nbsp;... appear calculated to alienate victims' survivors and the larger public from the 9/11 truth movement". The editor of the article has since written a [[rebuttal]] to the claims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060720083200/http://blogs.scripps.com/wcpo/staff/2006/02/wcpocoms_flight_93_story.html WCPO.com's Flight 93 Story] (Archived by the [[Internet Archive|Wayback Machine]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Valencia McClatchey, a local woman who took the only photograph of the mushroom cloud from the impact of Flight 93 seconds after it hit the ground, says she has been harassed over the telephone and in person by conspiracy theorists, who claim she faked the photo. The FBI, the Somerset County authorities, the Smithsonian, and the National Park Service's Flight 93 National Memorial staff have all individually examined the photograph as well as the film negatives and all four agencies consider the photo to be authentic.&lt;ref name=Flight93Photo&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/us/10cnd-shanksville.html |title=Picture Made on 9/11 Takes a Toll on Photographer |work=The New York Times |first=Sean D. |last=Hamill |date=September 10, 2007 |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the initial confusion surrounding the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the [[BBC]] published the names and identities of what they believed to be some of the hijackers.&lt;ref name="911Ct_SteveHerrmann" /&gt; Some of the people named were later discovered to be alive, a fact that was seized upon by 9/11 conspiracy theorists as proof that the hijackings were faked.&lt;ref name="911Ct_SteveHerrmann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Panoply"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Summers|first=Anthony|title=The Eleventh Day: The Full Story of 9/11 and Osama bin Laden|year=2011|publisher=Ballantine|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4000-6659-9|pages= |author2=Swan, Robbyn}}{{page needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC explained that the initial confusion may have arisen because the names they reported back in 2001 were common Arabic and Islamic names.&lt;ref name="911Ct_SteveHerrmann" /&gt; In response to a request from the BBC, the FBI said that it was confident to have identified all nineteen hijackers, and that none of the other inquiries had raised the issue of doubt about their identities.&lt;ref name="911Ct_SteveHerrmann"&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Herrmann |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2006/10/911_conspiracy_theory_1.html |title=9/11 Conspiracy Theory, by Steve Hermann, BBC Editor |publisher=BBC |date=October 27, 2006 |accessdate=January 28, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100108134031/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2006/10/911_conspiracy_theory_1.html| archivedate=January 8, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' also acknowledged these as cases of mistaken identity.&lt;ref&gt;Sack, Kevin.

According to John Bradley, the former managing editor of ''Arab News'' in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the only public information about the hijackers was a list of names issued by the FBI on September 14, 2001. When the FBI released photographs four days after the cited reports on September 27, the mistaken identities were quickly resolved. According to Bradley, "all of this is attributable to the chaos that prevailed during the first few days following the attack. What we're dealing with are coincidentally identical names." In Saudi Arabia, says Bradley, the names of two of the allegedly surviving attackers, [[Said al-Ghamdi]] and [[Walid al-Shari]], are "as common as John Smith in the United States or Great Britain."&lt;ref name="Panoply"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,265160-2,00.html |title=Panoply of the Absurd |work=Der Spiegel |date=September 23, 2001 |accessdate=May 30, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604163010/http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0%2C1518%2C265160-2%2C00.html |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thomas Kean, chair of the 9/11 Commission, "Sixteen of the nineteen shouldn't have gotten into the United States in any way at all because there was something wrong with their visas, something wrong with their passports.

A conspiracy theory documented by the [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[Conspiracy Encyclopedia|Thom Burnett]] and others is that the state of [[Israel]] was involved in the attacks, and may have planned them. A variety of motives are suggested, including: to cause the United States to attack enemies of Israel; to divert public attention away from Israel's treatment of [[Palestinians]]; to help [[Zionists]] take control of world affairs; and to persuade Americans to support Israel. Variants of the theory contend that the attack was organized by [[Ariel Sharon]], [[Mossad]], or the government of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;

Some proponents of this believe that Jewish employees were forewarned by Israeli intelligence to skip work on September 11, resulting in no Jewish deaths at the World Trade Center.

==== Antisemitism in conspiracy theories ====
In 2003, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) published a report attacking "hateful conspiracy theories" that the 9/11 attacks were carried about by Israelis and Jews, saying they had the potential to "rationalize and fuel global [[anti-Semitism]]." It found that such theories were widely accepted in the [[Arab conspiracy theories|Arab and Muslim world]], as well as in Europe and the United States.

The ADL's report found that "The Big Lie has united American [[far-right politics|far-right]] extremists and [[white supremacy|white supremacists]] and elements within the Arab and Muslim world". It asserted that many of the theories were modern manifestation of the 19th century [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], which purported to map out a Jewish conspiracy for world domination.&lt;ref name=mutations&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/presrele/asint_13/4346_13.htm |title=Conspiracy Theories About Jews and 9/11 Cause Dangerous Mutations in Global Anti-Semitism |publisher=Adl.org |date=September 2, 2003 |accessdate=May 30, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110525143344/http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASInt_13/4346_13.htm| archivedate=May 25, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/ADL_Opinions/Anti_Semitism_Arab/911_Conspiracies.htm|title=9/11 Conspiracy Theories Take Root in Arab/Muslim World|author=Abraham H.

=== No-planes theory ===
[[File:Noseoutframe.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The "no-plane theory", promoted via Internet videos, claims that this shot of the second impact, taken from a news helicopter, depicts a video composite of a [[Boeing 767]] accidentally appearing from behind a [[Layers (digital image editing)#Layer Mask|Layer Mask]].]]
Nico Haupt and former chief economist within the Labor Department under the Bush administration, [[Morgan Reynolds]], argue that no planes were used in the attacks. Reynolds claims it is physically impossible that the Boeing planes of Flights 11 and 175 could have penetrated the steel frames of the Towers, and that [[digital compositing]] was used to depict the plane crashes in both news reports and subsequent amateur video. "There were no planes, there were no hijackers", Reynolds insists. "I know, I know, I'm out of the mainstream, but that's the way it is". According to [[David Shayler]], "the only explanation is that they were missiles surrounded by holograms made to look like planes", he says, which would be well beyond the capabilities of contemporaneous [[hologram]] technology. "Watch footage frame by frame and you will see a cigar-shaped missile hitting the World Trade Center". Most no-planes adherents, including [[Thierry Meyssan]] and Reynolds, assert that either CGI of a passenger plane was overlaid onto a winged cruise missile or military aircraft, or that computer-generated images of a passenger plane were inserted into the video footage and plane-shaped explosive cut-outs were planted in the buildings in order to create the impression of plane impact.&lt;ref&gt;[Weekend Live, Fox News, September 10, 2006|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reQZT9Hzvt8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/01/september11.france]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Great Derangement, Matt Taibbi, New York, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some truth movement veterans have repeatedly refuted the "no-plane" claims.&lt;ref name="women.timesonline.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003250424_911conspire09.html| title = WP: 9/11 conspiracy theories| author = Michael Powell| date = September 8, 2006| publisher = [[MSNBC]]| accessdate = June 13, 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100723110251/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003250424_911conspire09.html| archivedate = July 23, 2010| deadurl = yes| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, discussion of no-plane theories has been banned from certain conspiracy theory websites and advocates have sometimes been threatened with violence by posters at other conspiracy theory websites.&lt;ref name=Yoda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2007-08-09/news/the-yoda-of-9-11/5 |title=The Yoda of 9/11|page=5 |work=Phoenix News|publisher=Phoenixnewtimes.com |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cockpit recorders ===
[[File:Flight 77 CVR.jpg|thumb|The [[cockpit voice recorder]] from [[American Airlines Flight 77|Flight 77]] was heavily damaged from the impact and resulting fire.]]
According to the 9/11 Commission Report, both black boxes from Flight 77 and both black boxes from Flight 93 were recovered. However, the CVR from Flight 77 was said to be too damaged to yield any data. On April 18, 2002, the FBI allowed the families of victims from Flight 93 to listen to the voice recordings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/04/18/rec.flight.93/index.html Families hear tape from hijacked Flight 93] April 18, 2002 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922042419/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/04/18/rec.flight.93/index.html |date=September 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006, a transcript of the CVR was released as part of the [[Zacarias Moussaoui]] trial.&lt;ref name="United93FullTranscript"&gt;{{Cite news

Two men, Michael Bellone and Nicholas DeMasi, who worked extensively in the wreckage of the World Trade Center, said in the book ''Behind-The-Scenes: Ground Zero'' that they helped federal agents find three of the four "black boxes" from the jetliners:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=William |last=Bunch |title=9/11 "black box" cover-up at Ground Zero? |date=October 28, 2004 |publisher=Philadelphia Newspapers, LLC |url=http://www.pnionline.com/dnblog/extra/archives/001139.html |work=Philadelphia Daily News |accessdate=November 6, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124011925/http://www.pnionline.com/dnblog/extra/archives/001139.html |archivedate=November 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bin Laden tapes ===
{{Main|Videos of Osama bin Laden}}

A series of interviews, audio and videotapes were released in the years following the 9/11 attacks that were reported to be from Osama bin Laden. In the first of these the speaker denied responsibility for the attacks. On September 17, 2001, in a statement issued to [[Al Jazeera]], Bin Laden is quoted as saying: "The U.S. government has consistently blamed me for being behind every occasion its enemies attack it. I would like to assure the world that I did not plan the recent attacks, which seems to have been planned by people for personal reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.binladen.denial/index.html |title=Bin Laden says he wasn't behind attacks CNN September 17, 2001 |publisher=CNN |date=September 17, 2001 |accessdate=July 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707090738/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.binladen.denial/index.html |archivedate=July 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a tape released in December 2001 known as 'the [[Jalalabad]] tape', the speaker is alleged to have foreknowledge of the attacks. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] claimed the tape was probably from [[Osama bin Laden]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Some observers, especially people in the [[Muslim world]], doubted the authenticity of the tape.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/september11/story/0,11209,619188,00.html U.S. urged to detail origin of tape] ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' December 15, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2001, German TV channel "[[Das Erste]]" broadcast an analysis of the White House's translation of the videotape. On the program ''Monitor'', two independent translators and an expert on [[Oriental Studies]] found the White House's translation to be both inaccurate and manipulative, stating, "At the most important places where it is held to prove the guilt of bin Laden, it is not identical with the Arabic", and that the words used that indicate foreknowledge can not be heard at all in the original. Prof. Gernot Rotter, professor of Islamic and Arabic Studies at the Asia-Africa Institute at the [[University of Hamburg]], said "The American translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that cannot be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021218105636/http://www.wdr.de/tv/monitor/beitraege.phtml?id=379 "Bin-Laden-Video: Falschübersetzung als Beweismittel?] WDR, Das Erste, MONITOR Nr. 485 am December 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
Some members of [[Scholars for 9/11 Truth]] believe that the man in this videotape is not Osama bin Laden at all, citing differences in weight and facial features, along with his wearing of a gold ring, which is forbidden by Muslim law, and writing with his right hand although bin Laden was left-handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Looking Glass News |url=http://www.lookingglassnews.org/viewstory.php?storyid=6233 |title=Osama Tape Appears Fake, Experts Conclude |publisher=Looking Glass News |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an audiotape released in November 2007, Bin Laden claimed responsibility for the attacks and denied the [[Taliban]] and the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] government or people had any prior knowledge of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/alqaida/page/0,12643,839823,00.html |title=Timeline: the al-Qaida tapes The Guardian Unlimited |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=July 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKL2912911920071129?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=Bin Laden urges Europe to quit Afghanistan Reuters UK November 29, 2007 |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=November 29, 2007 |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters-Voice&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKWAT00851220071129 |title=U.S. says voice on Qaeda tape appears to be bin Laden |publisher=Reuters |date=November 29, 2007 |accessdate=September 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with al-Jazeera, [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] and [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], two of al-Qaeda's alleged masterminds of the attacks, also confessed their involvement in the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We left out nuclear targets, for now|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/04/alqaida.terrorism|accessdate=July 11, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 March 2003|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Tenet released a statement denying the agency deliberately withheld information about the pair and noted Clarke himself said he had no proof.&lt;ref&gt;Shenon, Philip.

== Motives ==

=== Pax Americana ===
{{Main|Pax Americana}}

In 2006, members of the group [[Scholars for 9/11 Truth]] argued that a group of US neo-conservatives called the [[Project for a New American Century]] (PNAC), which included [[Paul Wolfowitz]], [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]], was set on US world dominance and orchestrated the 9/11 attacks as an excuse to hit Iraq, Afghanistan and later Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Narain|first=Jaya|journal=Daily Mail|title=Fury as academics claim 9/11 was 'inside job'|date=September 6, 2006|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-403757/Fury-academics-claim-9-11-inside-job.html|accessdate=December 8, 2009 | location=London| archiveurl= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20080923032338/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article%2D403757/Fury%2Dacademics%2Dclaim%2D9%2D11%2Dinside%2Djob.html| archivedate=September 23, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2000 the PNAC released a strategic treatise entitled ''Rebuilding America's Defences''. [[David Ray Griffin]] in his 2004 book ''[[The New Pearl Harbor|The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions About the Bush Administration and 9/11]]'' argued that the treatise may have been the blueprint for 9/11 attacks. Specifically the language in the paper that read "the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor" was describing an alleged motive.

The Defense Planning Guidance of 1992, was drafted by [[Paul Wolfowitz]] on behalf of then [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]]. This was described as "a blueprint for permanent American global [[hegemony]]" by [[Andrew Bacevich]] in his book ''American Empire: The Realities and Consequences of U.S. Diplomacy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Andrew J. Bacevich|title=American Empire: The Realities and Consequences of U.S. Diplomacy|location=Cambridge|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2002|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Taibbi argued in his book ''The Great Derangement'' that conspiracy theorists have taken what is written in the paper "completely out of context", and that the "transformation" referenced in the paper is explicitly said to be a decades-long process to turn the [[Cold War]]-era military into a "new, modern military" which could deal with more localized conflicts.&lt;ref name="tgd"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Taibbi| first = Matt| title = The Great Derangement| publisher = Spiegel &amp; Grau| year = 2008| location = New York| pages = 9–12, 148–166| isbn = 978-0-385-52034-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that, for this to be evidence of motive, either those responsible would have decided to openly state their objectives, or would have read the paper in 2000 and quickly laid the groundwork for the 9/11 attacks using it as inspiration.&lt;ref name="tgd" /&gt;

=== Invasions ===
Conspiracy theorists have questioned whether ''[[The Oil Factor]]'' and 9/11 provided the United States and the United Kingdom with a reason to launch a war they had wanted for some time, and suggest that this gives them a strong motive for either carrying out the attacks, or allowing them to take place. For instance, [[Andreas von Bülow]], a former research minister in the German government, has argued that 9/11 was staged to justify the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Connolly |first=Kate |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1447232/German-Sept-11-theory-stokes-anti-US-feeling.html |title=Telegraph, Nov 20, 2003 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=November 20, 2003 |accessdate=July 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Malaysia]]n premiere [[Mahathir Mohamad]] was quoted as saying that there was "strong evidence" that the attacks were faked so the United States could go to war against Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thejakartaglobe.com/home/if-us-could-create-avatar-it-could-fake-911-attacks-mahathir/354031 |title=If US Could Create 'Avatar', It Could Fake 9/11 Attacks: Mahathir Jakarta Times January 21, 2010 |work=Jakarta Globe |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722015907/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/if-us-could-create-avatar-it-could-fake-911-attacks-mahathir/354031 |archivedate=July 22, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of these allegations, the Bush administration specifically rejected proposals to immediately attack Iraq in response to 9/11,&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/sept11/911Report.pdf 9/11 Commission Report] pp. 334–336&lt;/ref&gt; and acknowledged that there was no evidence of Iraqi involvement in the attacks.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

=== New World Order ===
{{Main|New World Order (conspiracy theory)}}
[[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]] and other personalities hold that 9/11 was initiated by a disparate variety of banking, corporate, globalization, and military interests for the purpose of creating a globalist government. Such [[New World Order conspiracy theories]] predate 9/11.&lt;ref name=Stahl/&gt;

== Suggested historical precedents ==
Conspiracy theorists often point to [[Operation Northwoods]] as a model for the 9/11 attacks, theorizing the attacks were carried out by the U.S. government as a [[false flag]] operation and then blamed on Islamic extremists.&lt;ref name=Knight/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/16693/on-conspiracy-theories/ |author=Arshad Zaman |title=On conspiracy theories |publisher=The Express Tribune |date=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Northwoods was an unimplemented, apparently rejected, plan approved by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1962. One proposal in the plan suggested that covert operatives commit multiple acts of terrorism in U.S. cities and blame Cuba, thus providing a pretext for invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92662&amp;page=1#.Txr9tIHhfTo|title=U.S. Military Wanted to Provoke War With Cuba|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=May 1, 2001|accessdate=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine contrasted events which inspired past conspiracy theories with those that inspire 9/11 conspiracy theories such as the [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|assassination of John F. Kennedy]]. ''Time'' called the public assassination of Kennedy a "private, intimate affair" when compared with the attack on the World Trade Center, which was witnessed by millions of people and documented by hundreds of videographers; and said, "there is no event so plain and clear that a determined human being can't find ambiguity in it."&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

9/11 Conspiracy theory critic [[Jonathan Kay]] asserts that for the most part proponents are not out for financial gain and in some cases have left lucrative careers to become activists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/the_persistence_of_conspiracy_theories/24330366.html The Persistence of Conspiracy Theories Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty September 16, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

They found that proponents of 9/11 conspiracy theories were more likely to try and debunk the mainstream account than promote their own theories and also were more likely to believe in other conspiracy theories. Proponents of the mainstream account tended to argue for that account and showed a greater hostility toward conspiracy theory proponents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontiersin.org/personality_science_and_individual_differences/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00409/abstract "What about building 7?"

=== Dissecting the 9/11 Truth movement community ===
According to a 2011 analysis in a ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' article, people involved in this movement, which seemingly is a disparate group with very diversified backgrounds, could be classified into three groups. They join the movement for different reasons, loosely self-assemble to fill different roles and are united by their shared mistrust in experts and the establishment (government and reputable sources of knowledge), and conspiratorial stance. Through their engagement, they each find their own fulfillment and satisfaction. Together, they contribute to the persistence, resilience and exaggerated claims of acceptance (in general public) of the movement. These three groups are:&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bartlett |first1=Jamie |last2=Miller |first2=Carl |title=A Bestiary of the 9/11 Truth Movement: Notes from the Front Line |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|volume=35.4|issue=July/August|pages=43–46|year=2011|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/a_bestiary_of_the_9_11_truth_movement_notes_from_the_front_line |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hard Core: The organizers and active members of the various 9/11 Truth Movement organizations. They produce the information, spot the anomalies and technical inconsistencies, provide the technical base and form the theories. While they claim to be only interested in facts and to use [[scientific method]], they commit the logical fallacy of '[[confirmation bias]]' by pre-determining the outcome, then searching for corroborating evidence while ignoring the vast body of [[peer-review]]ed, independent, consensual research which contradict their theories. They supply the physical structure of the movement by organizing events, seminars, discussions, marches and distributing flyers and pamphlets. Their numbers are relatively small but they are tight-knit and highly connected. Their worldview favors 'super-conspiracy', a master plan that is behind conspiracies which they believe they are uncovering.&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt;
* Critically turned: They are the young students and political activists whose affiliation with the 9/11 Truth Movement often is rooted from their dissatisfaction and anger at the established political and social order. Their sense of justice and [[idealism]] propels them to activism against perceived oppression and social injustice. Their penchant to use Internet, especially [[social media]], and tech savvy make them the propaganda machine for the movement. They produce [[YouTube]] videos and films with cool, countercultural content, make good use of pop culture parody and eye-catching graphics. The countercultural street cred of their productions buy them broad appeal and exposure to millions of people.&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt;
* Illiterati: They are the movement's mass membership backbone, a large, diffuse group which give the movement exaggerated claims of popularity and influence. Participation in the 9/11 Truth Movement, to this group of people, is as much a social and recreational pursuit as the quest for truth. Their partaking is mostly through [[web 2.0]] social networking and YouTube. Their commentaries often are emotional and they make no pretense to be accurate, balanced or to show genuine intent to find truth. Involvement with the movement that fit their worldview gives them a sense of identity and belonging, which they find more appealing than the facts and evidences of the 9/11 terrorist attack itself.&lt;ref name=Bartlett/&gt;

== Media reaction ==
While discussion and coverage of these theories is mainly confined to Internet pages, books, documentary films, and conversation, a number of mainstream news outlets around the world have covered the issue.

The Norwegian version of the July 2006 ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' sparked interest when they ran, on their own initiative, a three-page main story on the 9/11 attacks and summarized the various types of 9/11 conspiracy theories (which were not specifically endorsed by the newspaper, only recensed).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lmd.no/index.php?article=947 11.September – en innsidejobb?], Norwegian edition of ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', July 2006.

An article in the September 11, 2006, edition of ''Time'' magazine comments that the major 9/11 conspiracy theories "depend on circumstantial evidence, facts without analysis or documentation, quotes taken out of context and the scattered testimony of traumatized eyewitnesses", and enjoy continued popularity because "the idea that there is a malevolent controlling force orchestrating global events is, in a perverse way, comforting". It concludes that "conspiracy theories are part of the process by which Americans deal with traumatic public events" and constitute "an American form of national mourning."&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Lev.

Australian newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' published an article titled "The CIA couldn't have organised this&amp;nbsp;..." which said "The same people who are making a mess of Iraq were never so clever or devious that they could stage a complex assault on two narrow towers of steel and glass" and "if there is a nefarious plot in all this bad planning, it is one improvised by a confederacy of dunces". This article mainly attacked a group of scientists led by Professor [[Steven E. Jones]], now called [[9/11 Truth Movement#Scholars for 9/11 Truth &amp; Justice|Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice]]. They said "most of them aren't scientists but instructors&amp;nbsp;... at second-rate colleges".&lt;ref name="CIACouldntHaveOrganisedThis"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/09/08/ftterror08.xml&amp;page=4 |title = The CIA couldn't have organised this&amp;nbsp;... |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |author = Michael Shelden |accessdate=September 23, 2009 |date=September 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doug MacEachern in a May 2008 column for ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' wrote that while many "9/11 truthers" are not crackpots that espouse "crackpot conspiracy theories", supporters of the theories fail to take into account both human nature and that nobody has come forward claiming they were participants in the alleged conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/viewpoints/articles/0511vip-maceachern0511.html |title=Truthers are overlooking key point about 9/11 Human nature Doug MacEachern for the Arizona Republic May 11, 2008 |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=May 11, 2008 |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was seconded by Timothy Giannuzzi, a ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' [[op-ed]] columnist specializing in foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Calgary |first=The |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/theeditorialpage/story.html?id=0bc82ffe-1e2e-4991-93ea-0f384b864bad&amp;p=2 |title=Washington can't live up to standards of 9/11 'truthers Timothy Giannuzzi for the Calgary Herald July 10, 2008 |publisher=Canada.com |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918100543/http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/theeditorialpage/story.html?id=0bc82ffe-1e2e-4991-93ea-0f384b864bad&amp;p=2 |archivedate=September 18, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2008, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' published a lengthy article on the [[9/11 Truth Movement]] and 9/11 conspiracy theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8d66e778-3128-11dd-ab22-000077b07658.html |title=The Truth Is Out There |work=Financial Times |author=Peter Barber |date=June 7, 2008 |accessdate=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlie Brooker]], a British comedian and multimedia personality, in a July 2008 column published by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as part of its "Comment is free" series agreed that 9/11 conspiracy theorists fail to take in account human fallacies and added that believing in these theories gives theorists a sense of belonging to a community that shares privileged information thus giving the theorists a delusional sense of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Charlie Brooker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/14/september11.usa |title=So, you believe in conspiracy theories, do you?

On September 12, 2008, [[All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company|Russian State Television]] broadcast in prime time a documentary made by [[Member of the European Parliament]] [[Giulietto Chiesa]] entitled ''Zero'', sympathetic to those who question the accepted account of the attacks according to Chiesa. According to [[Thierry Meyssan]] in conjunction with the documentary, Russian State Television aired a debate on the subject. The panel consisted of members from several countries including 12 Russians who hold divergent views. The motive of Russian State Television in broadcasting the documentary was questioned by a commentator from ''[[The Other Russia (coalition)|The Other Russia]]'' who noted that Russian State Television had a history of broadcasting programs involving [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving the [[United States government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3626100,00.html |title=DPA News Agency Filmmaker Urges International Tribunal to Probe 9/11 September 9, 2008 |publisher=Dw-world.de |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasir Mahmood in a commentary printed by the ''[[Pakistan Observer]]'' wrote favorably about a 9/11 truth lecture and film festival held in California and quoted a Jewish speaker at that festival who said that none of the 19 suspected hijackers had been proven guilty of anything and compared racism against Muslims resulting from what he called false accusations to the racism against Jews in the Nazi era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pakobserver.net/200809/15/news/topstories07.asp |title=19 Muslims involved in 9/11 never proved guilty by anybody |author=Nasir Mahmood |publisher=Pakistan Observer |date=September 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918020434/http://pakobserver.net/200809/15/news/topstories07.asp |archivedate=2008-09-18 |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the [[birther movement]] in 2009 has led to comparisons between that movement and the 9/11 Truth movement, with both movements seen in a very negative light.

On August 31, 2009, the [[National Geographic Channel]] aired the program ''9/11 Science and Conspiracy'', in which the [[Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center]] tested some of the claims frequently made by those who question the accepted 9/11 account. Specifically, the experiments concluded that burning jet fuel alone can sufficiently raise the temperature of a steel support column to the point of structural failure, that a controlled demolition using conventional techniques would leave clear evidence that was not found at Ground Zero, that using [[thermite]] is not an effective technique to melt a steel column, and that even if thermite chemical signatures were found, it would be impossible to tell if thermite was actually used or if the traces came from the reaction of aircraft aluminum with other substances in the fire. The testing also concluded that the type of hole found at the Pentagon was consistent with the standard scenario, and that damage from a bombing or missile attack would differ from the damage that occurred. In the program, several prominent 9/11 conspiracy theorists viewed rough edits of the experiments, and expressed their disagreement with the findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/9-11-science-and-conspiracy-4067/ |title=9/11 Science and Conspiracy Theory Website |publisher=Channel.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=May 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518135528/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/9-11-science-and-conspiracy-4067/ |archivedate=May 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[National Geographic Channel]] 9/11 Science and Conspiracy.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' editorialized against [[Yukihisa Fujita]], a prominent Japanese politician who has espoused 9/11 conspiracy theories. They described Fujita as a man "susceptible to the imaginings of the lunatic fringe". It went on to say that the [[Japan–United States relations|U.S.–Japan alliance]] would be "severely tested" if Fujita's party continued to tolerate these kinds of comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/07/AR2010030702354.html |title=A leading Japanese politician espouses a 9/11 fantasy Washington Post March 8, 2010 |work=The Washington Post |date= March 8, 2010|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the ninth anniversary of the attacks the Egyptian daily ''[[Al-masry Al-youm]]'' published an article questioning the U.S. Government story and promoting conspiracy theories. The senior analyst for the semi-official [[Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies]] and a member of Parliament from the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] was quoted.

Gordon Farrer, the technology editor for ''[[The Age]]'', theorized in a November 2010 column for the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' that the popularity of 9/11 conspiracy theories was a result of two main factors. One revolved around the personality traits of the theorists themselves (cynical, anxious, belief that they are [[Freethought|freethinkers]]). The second revolved around the high [[internet search]] ranking 9/11 conspiracy theories receive, leading to a false air of authority to the theories. Speaking of the theorists. Farrer wrote that "when politicians and media don't give them voice they feel more threatened, more suspicious, cornered, helpless; and so they go on the attack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/blogs/untangling-the-web/dont-get-caught-in-the-web-of-conspiracy-theory-truthiness/20101105-17gq1.html |title=Don't get caught in the web of conspiracy theory truthiness|first= Gordon |last=Farrer|publisher= Sydney Morning Herald – Smh.com.au |date=November 5, 2010 |accessdate=May 30, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110315183816/http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/blogs/untangling-the-web/dont-get-caught-in-the-web-of-conspiracy-theory-truthiness/20101105-17gq1.html| archivedate=March 15, 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article also said there are conspiracy theories that claim that [[7 World Trade Center]] was also downed by a controlled demolition, that the Pentagon being hit by a missile, that the hijacked planes were packed with explosives and flown by remote control, that Israel was behind the attacks, that a plane headed for the Pentagon was shot down by a missile, that there was [[insider trading]] by people who had foreknowledge of the attacks were all false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/05/9-11-conspiracy-theories-debunked|title = 9/11 conspiracy theories debunked|date = September 5, 2011|accessdate = February 5, 2016|website = [[The Guardian]]|last = McGreal|first = Chris|publication-place = Washington, D.C.|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205131010/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/05/9-11-conspiracy-theories-debunked|archive-date = February 5, 2016|dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Critics of these conspiracy theories say they are a form of [[conspiracism]] common throughout history after a traumatic event in which [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] emerge as a mythic form of explanation.{{sfn|Barkun|2003}} A related criticism addresses the form of research on which the theories are based. Thomas W. Eagar, an engineering professor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], suggested they "use the 'reverse scientific method'. They determine what happened, throw out all the data that doesn't fit their conclusion, and then hail their findings as the only possible conclusion." Eagar's criticisms also exemplify a common stance that the theories are best ignored. "I've told people that if the argument gets too mainstream, I'll engage in the debate." According to him, this happened when Steve Jones, a physics professor at [[Brigham Young University]], took up the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Walch |first = Tad |year = 2006 |url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,645200098,00.html |title = Controversy dogs Y.'s Jones |work = Utah news |publisher = Deseret News Publishing Company |accessdate=September 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]], writing in ''[[Scientific American]]'', said:
"The mistaken belief that a handful of unexplained anomalies can undermine a well-established theory lies at the heart of all conspiratorial thinking. All the evidence for a 9/11 conspiracy falls under the rubric of this fallacy. Such notions are easily refuted by noting that scientific theories are not built on single facts alone but on a convergence of evidence assembled from multiple lines of inquiry."&lt;ref name="SciAm"/&gt;

Journalist [[Matt Taibbi]], in his book ''The Great Derangement'', discusses 9/11 conspiracy theories as symptomatic of what he calls the "derangement" of American society; a disconnection from reality due to widespread "disgust with our political system".&lt;ref name="tgd"/&gt; Drawing a parallel with the [[Charismatic Movement]], he argues that both "chose to battle bugbears that were completely idiotic, fanciful, and imaginary," instead of taking control of their own lives.&lt;ref name="tgd" /&gt; While critical, Taibbi explains that 9/11 conspiracy theories are different from "[[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]-era black-helicopter paranoia", and constitute more than "a small, scattered group of nutcases [...] they really were, just as they claim to be, almost everyone you meet."&lt;ref name="tgd" /&gt;

Columnist Matt Mankelow, writing for the online edition of the British ''[[Socialist Worker]]'', concludes that 9/11 Truthers, while "desperately trying to legitimately question a version of events", end up playing into the hands of the [[neoconservatives]] they are trying to take down by creating a diversion.

[[Harvard University|Harvard]] Law professor [[Cass Sunstein]] co-authored a 2009 paper which used members of the 9/11 Truth movement and others as an examples of people who suffer from "crippled epistemologies", to public trust and the political system. He wrote that "[t]hey do not merely undermine democratic debate&amp;nbsp;[...] In extreme cases, they create or fuel violence.

In June 2011 the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] was criticized for hosting a lecture by Richard Gage, president of [[Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth]]. Rick Bell, the director of the [[American Institute of Architects]] New York chapter, who was a witness to the 9/11 attacks, said that "no amount of money" would persuade him to allow the group to talk at his headquarters and said that Gage lacks credibility among the professional community. [[Kohn Pedersen Fox|Eugine Kohn]], former spokesperson for the American Institute of Architects, said Gage's theories were "ridiculous", "[t]here were no explosives planted", and "[t]he buildings were definitely brought down by the planes". The decision to host the event was also criticized by the former president of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] and the founding president of the [[American Institute of Architects]]' United Kingdom chapter. Gage has been warned by the AIA against giving a false impression that he has a relationship with them. A July article in the organization's magazine criticized Gage for continuing to intimate that he has an association with them and claimed there were no architects at an Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth screening held in an American Institute of Architects boardroom &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architectmagazine.com/architecture/architects-shy-from-truther-conspiracy-theory_1.aspx Architects Shy From Truther 9/11 Conspiracy Theory Architect Magazine July 19, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616211232/http://www.architectmagazine.com/architecture/architects-shy-from-truther-conspiracy-theory_1.aspx |date=June 16, 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Institute of British Architects released a statement saying the perception that the group endorses events held in its buildings is "regrettable", and said they would review policy on "private hire" of its buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Petrunia, Paul.

U.S. representative [[Peter T.

The hosts of "[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]]" (the "SGU") have spoken repeatedly about the "absurdity of 9/11 conspiracy theories". In addition to critiquing the theories using the same or similar arguments as the above, the "SGU" hosts say that, like most conspiracy theories, this one collapses under its own weight and contradicts itself. In order for the 9/11 conspiracy theories to be correct, the U.S. government would not only have to orchestrate the claimed false flag operation regarding the airplanes that crashed into the World Trade Center, but they would also have to orchestrate a superfluous controlled demolition and cover their tracks so flawlessly that it becomes indistinguishable to physicists from the "official story," yet the plan would have to be flawed enough so that "losers in their mothers' basement" will discover the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;SGU Productions.

Former Canadian [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] leader [[Stéphane Dion]] forced a candidate from [[Winnipeg]], Lesley Hughes, to terminate her campaign after earlier writings from Hughes surfaced in which Hughes wrote that U.S., German, Russian and Israeli intelligence officials knew about the 9/11 attacks in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/FederalElection/article/506806 |title=Dion drops candidate over 9/11 remarks Toronto Star September 26, 2008 |work=Toronto Star |date=September 26, 2008 |accessdate=July 20, 2009 | first=Bruce | last=Campion-Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BeWaryOfThoseWhoSay911WasAFake"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/comment/story.html?id=efc419f6-7030-45c7-b431-8976158b23df| title = Be wary of those who say 9/11 was a fake| date = October 5, 2008| accessdate = September 20, 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006123037/http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/comment/story.html?id=efc419f6-7030-45c7-b431-8976158b23df| archivedate = October 6, 2008| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, [[Peter Kent]], Deputy Editor of [[Global Television Network]] News and [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] candidate in the 2008 Canadian election, had called for Hughes's resignation saying that the 9/11 Truth movement is "one of Canada's most notorious hatemongering fringe movements" composed of "conspiracy theorists who are notorious for holding anti-Semitic views."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Conservative Party Of Canada |url=https://www.conservative.ca/EN/1091/106439 |title=Dion must fire his anti-israel candidate Conservative Party Press Release September 26, 2008 |publisher=Conservative.ca |date=September 26, 2008 |accessdate=July 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103175309/http://www.conservative.ca/EN/1091/106439 |archivedate=November 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 16, 2009, Hughes sued Kent, the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]], the [[B'nai B'rith]] of Canada and four senior members of the two organizations alleging the [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] allegations were untrue and defamatory and ruined her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Nick |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/hughes-sues-mp-bnai-brith-says-anti-semite-accusations-have-ruined-career-48864447.html |title=Hughes sues MP, B'Nai Brith Says anti-Semite accusations have ruined career Winnipeg Free Press June 23, 2009 |publisher=Winnipegfreepress.com |date=June 23, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090628115751/http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/hughes-sues-mp-bnai-brith-says-anti-semite-accusations-have-ruined-career-48864447.html| archivedate=June 28, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later another Conservative Party candidate called for the leader of the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] to fire a candidate for her pro 9/11 truth views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Conservative Party Of Canada |url=https://www.conservative.ca/EN/1091/106644 |title=Ottawa NDP continue to flirt with fringe Conservative Party Press release September 30, 2008 |publisher=Conservative.ca |accessdate=July 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103175808/http://www.conservative.ca/EN/1091/106644 |archivedate=November 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zijad Delic]] head of Canada's largest Muslim advocacy organization, the [[Canadian Islamic Congress]] is trying to remove 9/11 conspiracy theorists from the board of the organization, in an effort to what he describes as purifying within and totally canadianize the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/Saturday+Interview+Canadian+imam/3646630/story.html |title=Saturday Interview: The CIC's Canadian imam National Post October 2010 |work=National Post |location=Canada |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, calls for the resignation of [[Richard Falk]], the special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories for the United Nations, were partially based on his support investigating the validity of 9/11 conspiracy theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abrams |first=Joseph |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,369122,00.html |title=Critics Demand Resignation of U.N.

In September 2009, [[Van Jones]], an adviser to US President Barack Obama, resigned after his signature on a 2004 petition calling for an investigation into whether government officials deliberately allowed the 9/11 attacks to occur and other controversial statements came to light drawing criticism. Van Jones said he was a victim of a smear campaign, adding that he does not currently, nor ever has agreed with that theory.&lt;ref name="ObamaDidNotOrderVanJonesResignation"&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/09/06/obama.adviser.resigns/| title = Obama did not order Van Jones' resignation, adviser says| date = September 6, 2009| publisher = CNN |accessdate=September 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9/11 truth movement became an issue in the 2010 Texas Gubernatorial Republican primary when candidate [[Debra Medina]] replied when asked by [[Glenn Beck]] about US government involvement in the 9/11 attacks: "I think some very good questions have been raised in that regard, there are some very good arguments, and I think the American people have not seen all of the evidence there, so I have not taken a position on that." After being criticized for the remarks by opposing candidates, Medina said that she has never been a 9/11 truth movement member and believes the twin towers were attacked by Muslim terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2010/02/11/2200374.aspx|title=Perry, KBH blast Medina|publisher=MSNBC|date=February 11, 2010|accessdate=October 23, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216135306/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2010/02/11/2200374.aspx|archivedate=February 16, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2010/0211/Debra-Medina-self-destructs-on-Glenn-Beck-radio-show |title=Debra Medina self-destructs on Glenn Beck radio show Cristian Science Monitor February 11, 2010 |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date=February 11, 2010 |accessdate=October 23, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101022025158/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2010/0211/Debra-Medina-self-destructs-on-Glenn-Beck-radio-show| archivedate=October 22, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] made statements that were skeptical of al-Qaeda executing the 9/11 attacks.]]
On September 23, 2010, Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in a speech to the United Nations said that "[t]he majority of the American people, as well as other nations and politicians, believe [...] some segments within the U.S. government orchestrated the attack to reverse the declining U.S. economy and its grips on the Middle East in order also to save the [[Zionism|Zionist]] regime".

In 2012, Egyptian President [[Mohamed Morsi]] has called for a scientific conference to look into the events of 9/11 and speculated that the attacks were an inside job. According to an international poll that same year, huge majorities in Muslim countries prefer to believe baseless conspiracy theories rather than listen to the mainstream facts of what happened on September 11, 2001, in New York City and Washington. Although al-Qaeda occasionally brags about its "achievement," 75 percent of Egyptian citizens, for example, still deny that Arabs carried out the attacks, as a Pew study reported in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/getting-egypts-morsi-to-give-up-911-conspiracy-rhetoric/2012/09/11/4ca304ea-fb97-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_story.html |title=Getting Egypt's Morsi to give up his 9/11 'truther' talk by Robert Satloff and Eric Trager of the Washington Post September 11, 2012 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal cases ==
Army specialist April Gallop filed suit claiming that Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and other Bush administration officials orchestrated the 9/11 attacks and that the Pentagon was hit by an attack ordered by Cheney. The suit was dismissed in 2010 by Judge [[Denny Chin]], who said the claim was "the product of cynical delusion and fantasy". Her lawyers filed an appeal to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]] which in April 2010 issued a [[show cause order]] why the lawyers and Gallop should not be sanctioned for filing a frivolous lawsuit. Her lawyers asked that the judges on the Court of Appeals recuse themselves because their emotions made them prejudge the case and abuse their power. On October 14, 2011, the judges sanctioned her lawyers $15,000 each for both the frivolous lawsuits and the accusations of prejudice. Gallop was not fined because of her unfamiliarity with the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=vicfedorov |url=http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=1202519035977&amp;slreturn=1 |title=Circuit Levels $15,000 in Sanctions Against 9/11 Conspiracy Theorists New York Law Journal October 17, 2010 |publisher=Newyorklawjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alternative Party''' is a [[demoscene]] and [[art]] event in Finland. It was first organized in 1998 in [[Turku]] and since 2000 in [[Helsinki]]. The event is organized by Alternative Party ry, a non-profit association.

Alternative Party is one of the largest [[demo party|demo parties]] in Finland. The aim of the event is to encourage artists (both demoscene and traditional arts) to creativity and new perspectives &amp;ndash; regardless of the used equipment. The event is known for its peculiar competitions. The main focus has traditionally mean on less common computers, although PCs are currently accepted as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sektori.com/artikkelit/3108/ristikuulustelussa Ristikuulustelussa Alternative Partyjen puuhamies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070630/http://sektori.com/artikkelit/3108/ristikuulustelussa |date=2007-09-27 }} {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peliplaneetta.net/artikkelit/160/ Mikko Heinonen: Alternative Party 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717073336/http://www.peliplaneetta.net/artikkelit/160/ |date=2007-07-17 }} {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competitions — except for the main demo competition — tend to change every year as an extra challenge. There is also a traditional concert on the first evening, featuring artists of demoscene background playing live music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altparty.org/archive.html Alternative Party | Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The seventh Alternative Party was held on 2-4 November 2007 in Helsinki.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altparty.org/alternative-party-2007.html Alternative Party 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers included [[Al Lowe]], creator of the legendary [[Leisure Suit Larry]] series of games.

The Alternative Party held on 24-26 October 2008 in Helsinki was the first time that one of the big pioneers of industrial music, [[Front 242]], played for a Finnish audience. The special guest of honour was [[Brad Templeton]], founder of [[ClariNet]] and, from 2008, chairman of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. 

Cyberpunk themed Alt Party 2009 was held on 23-25 October 2009 at Cable Factory ([[Kaapelitehdas]]), Helsinki.

The '''Australian Wooden Boat Festival''' ('''[[MyState Financial|MyState]] Australian Wooden Boat Festival''') is a biennial event held in [[Hobart]] [[Tasmania]] celebrating [[wooden boat]]s. AWBF is held concurrently with the [[Royal Hobart Regatta]].  The festival welcomes wooden boats of all sizes including wooden [[canoes]], [[kayaks]] and [[dinghies]] as well as [[yachts]] and [[tall ships]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australianwoodenboatfestival.com.au/ Australian Wooden Boat Festival Web site &lt;/ref&gt;

This festival is a celebration of Australia's maritime heritage, though restricts participation by organizations with interests in modern maritime issues, such as preservation of maritime law and combating poachers in the [[Australian Whale Sanctuary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seashepherd.org.au/news-and-commentary/news/hobart-festival-banned-sea-shepherd.html|title=Sea Shepherd Australia - Hobart festival banned Sea Shepherd|website=www.seashepherd.org.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Tasmania's rich history of food and wines are also a focal point during this event. It has a major economic benefit to the island state of Tasmania, with accommodation fully booked during the event.

'''The MSA British RallyCross Championship'''  is an [[auto racing]] [[RallyCross]] series, running in the [[United Kingdom]].  The 2018 championship is known as the [[Toyo Tire &amp; Rubber Company|TOYO Tyre's]] MSA British RallyCross Championship. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rallycrossbrx.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The championship is recognised as an official Championship by the [[Motor Sports Association]] who are the governing body of Motorsport in Great Britain.  

==History==

The first Rallycross event was organised at Lydden circuit, near Canterbury in Kent, on Saturday 4 February 1967.

Originally intended as a one off conceived by Robert Reed, a producer on ABC TV's World of Sport programme and organised for the broadcaster by the Tunbridge Wells centre of the 750 Motor Club under the leadership of Bud Smith, the event was such a huge success that more TV specials soon followed. And it wasn't long before 'clubmans' events were being run for autocross, race and rally drivers who'd become captivated by the new sport.

The first event was won by Vic Elford – already a successful rally driver and someone who would go on to drive in F1 and have great success as a sports car racer – driving a [[Porsche 911]] owned by AFN, at that time the official [[Porsche]] importer for Great Britain.

It is claimed that the foot and mouth outbreak of 1967, which caused the cancellation of that year's [[RAC Rally]], gave rise to Rallycross. However, Rallycross had been born in February 1967 and the November foot and mouth disease actually prevented some drivers attending the first Rallycross event to be staged at Croft, near Darlington in County Durham, on 30 December 1967.

There is a link to the abandoned RAC British Rally of 1967. A televised Rallycross had been organised to take place following the rally. However, following its cancellation, most of the foreign drivers and teams left Britain and the Rallycross lost many of its expected star entries. The event still took place and was won by Rootes Group driver Andrew Cowan.

With the bit firmly between its teeth, [[ITV Network|ITV]] ran a championship season through the winter of 1967–68, the winner of which, and the first man ever to win a Rallycross championship was Welshman Tony Chappell.

ITV's monopoly on the sport, its man Reed had thought up, was lost in August 1968 when the [[BBC]] struck a deal with Lydden owner Bill Chesson giving them virtually exclusive access to events at the Kentish track. ITV moved North, basing itself at Croft and later added events at Cadwell Park, near Louth in Lincolnshire.

The television companies first fought over Rallycross then ignored it. ITV was gone by the middle '70s and BBC's coverage had declined to one or two events a year by the time it dropped the British round of the [[European Rallycross Championship]] from its roster a decade later. The British Rallycross Grand Prix was the last event to be shown by the national broadcaster but that too ended after the 1994 event – the last to be run at Brands Hatch and in the event's traditional winter slot.

Rallycross spread to Europe within a couple of years of its creation and in 1973 the 'Embassy European Trophy' was won by Scotsman John Taylor in an Escort RS1600. The first officially sanctioned European Rallycross Championship followed in 1976 – won by Austria's Franz Wurz in a Lancia Stratos – the same year that Britain got its official British Rallycross Championship, won by Trevor Hopkins in an Escort RS1800.

'''''Clue'''''  is a 1985 American [[ensemble film|ensemble]] [[Mystery film|mystery]] [[comedy film]] based on the [[Cluedo|board game of the same name]]. The film was directed by [[Jonathan Lynn]], who collaborated on the script with [[John Landis]], and stars [[Eileen Brennan]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Madeline Kahn]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Michael McKean]], [[Martin Mull]], and [[Lesley Ann Warren]]. The film was produced by [[Debra Hill]].

In keeping with the nature of the board game, the theatrical release included three possible endings, with different theaters receiving one of the three endings. In the film's home video release, all three endings were included. The film initially received mixed reviews and did poorly at the [[box office]], ultimately grossing $14.6 million in the United States against its budget of $15 million,&lt;ref name="Clue 1985"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=clue.htm |title=Clue (1985) |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date=1988-07-05 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it later developed a [[cult following]].&lt;ref name= "Buzzfeed"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/something-terrible-has-happened-here-the-crazy-story-of-how |title='Something Terrible Has Happened Here': The Crazy Story of How 'Clue' Went from Forgotten Flop to Cult Triumph |publisher=Buzzfeed.com |date=2013-09-02 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1954, six strangers are invited to a dinner party at Hill House, a secluded New England mansion. They are met by the [[butler]], Wadsworth, who gives each of them a [[pseudonym]], with none of them knowing or being addressed by their real names. The guests – Colonel Mustard, Mrs. White, Mrs. Peacock, Mr. Green, Professor Plum, and Miss Scarlet – are served by Wadsworth and the maid, Yvette.

During dinner, a seventh guest, Mr. Boddy, arrives. Afterwards, Wadsworth reveals the real reason they are there: Mr. Boddy has been [[blackmail]]ing the other guests (as well as Wadsworth and his now-dead wife, it is later revealed) for some time now. The group is here to confront him and turn him over to the police.

Mr. Boddy, however, reminds them that if he is arrested, their guilty secrets for which he has been blackmailing them will be exposed. He then gives each of the other guests a different weapons as a gift (a [[candlestick]], a [[dagger]], a [[Water pipe|lead pipe]], a [[revolver]], a [[rope]], and a [[wrench]]), suggesting that one of them kill Wadsworth instead to avoid exposure and humiliation. When he turns out the lights, a gunshot rings out, and when the lights are turned back on, they find Mr. Boddy apparently dead with no visible trace as to how. Later, the cook Mrs. Ho is found dead, stabbed with the dagger, and Mr. Boddy's body disappears, only to be rediscovered dead again but with new injuries from the candlestick.

Wadsworth locks the weapons in the cupboard and is about to throw the key out when a stranded motorist arrives and is locked in the [[Living room|lounge]]. Wadsworth then throws the key out onto the blacktop. Colonel Mustard proposes they split into pairs and search the house to make sure no one else is there. While they are searching, the motorist is killed with the wrench by a figure that is presumed to be his former employer. Mustard and Scarlet find his corpse in the locked lounge and Yvette uses the revolver from the now-open cupboard to break the keyhole. A police officer investigating the motorist's abandoned car arrives and comes inside to use the phone. The guests resume their search of the mansion. The electricity is then turned off. Yvette, the cop, and a singing telegram girl are subsequently murdered with the rope, lead pipe, and revolver, respectively.

Wadsworth and the others regroup after he turns the electricity back on, and he reveals he knows who the murderer is. He proceeds to recreate the events of the night so far as to explain how the murders occurred. He reveals that the other five people who died with Mr. Boddy were his accomplices, who gave him vital information about the different guests. After an evangelist interrupts them, Wadsworth continues and shuts off the electricity again.

In the theatrical showing, at this point audiences would then be shown one of the three following endings after Wadsworth brings the lights back up. In the home media, all three endings were included, with "Ending A" and "Ending B" identified as possible endings but "Ending C" being how the events really occurred.

===Ending A===
Yvette murdered the cook and Mr. Boddy under orders from Miss Scarlet, for whom she once worked as a call girl. Miss Scarlet then killed her along with the other murder victims. She wanted to keep her business of extortion safe and now plans to sell the other guests' secrets. She intends to shoot Wadsworth, who asserts there are no more bullets in the gun. Wadsworth then reveals himself to be an undercover FBI agent, takes the gun from Miss Scarlet and apprehends her. The evangelist is revealed to be a police chief, who arrives with cops and agents. To prove that the gun was empty, Wadsworth fires it towards the ceiling. However, it still contained one bullet, and the gunshot brings down the hall chandelier right behind Colonel Mustard, narrowly missing him (again, the first time being when Yvette breaks the keyhole).

===Ending B===
Mrs. Peacock killed all the victims to cover up her engagement of bribes from foreign powers. Mrs. Peacock holds the others at gunpoint while she escapes to her car, but she is caught by the chief (the evangelist). Wadsworth reveals he is an undercover FBI agent planted to spy on her activities as to secure her arrest.

===Ending C===
Each murder was committed by a different person. Professor Plum killed Mr. Boddy in the hall with the candlestick, Mrs. Peacock killed the cook in the kitchen with the knife, Colonel Mustard killed the motorist in the lounge with the wrench (and picked out the key from Wadsworth's pocket), Mrs. White killed Yvette in the billiard room with the rope, and Miss Scarlet killed the cop in the library with the lead pipe. Mr. Green is therefore accused of killing the singing telegram girl, but Wadsworth reveals he killed her in the hall with the revolver, and that he is, in fact, the real Mr. Boddy (the man Professor Plum killed was his butler). With the witnesses to each of their secret activities dead and the evidence destroyed, Mr. Boddy now plans on continuing to blackmail them all. Mr. Green suddenly pulls out a revolver and kills Mr. Boddy. He reveals himself as an undercover FBI agent who has been on Mr. Boddy's case. He brings in the chief/evangelist to arrest the others.

==Production==

===Development===
The multiple-ending concept was developed by [[John Landis]], who claimed in an interview to have invited playwright [[Tom Stoppard]], writer and composer [[Stephen Sondheim]] and actor [[Anthony Perkins]] to write the screenplay. The script was ultimately finished by director Jonathan Lynn.&lt;ref name = Buzzfeed /&gt;

A fourth ending was filmed, but Lynn removed it because, as he later stated, "it really wasn't very good. I looked at it, and I thought, 'No, no, no, we've got to get rid of that.'"&lt;ref name="farr20120313"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abnormaluse.com/2012/03/abnormal-interview-my-cousin-vinny-director-jonathan-lynn.html | title=Abnormal Interviews: My Cousin Vinny Director Jonathan Lynn | publisher=Gallivan, White &amp; Boyd, P.A. | work=Abnormal Use: An Unreasonably Dangerous Products Liability Blog | date=2012-03-13 | accessdate=June 8, 2012 | author=Farr, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the unused fourth ending, Wadsworth committed all of the murders. He was motivated by his desire for perfection. Having failed to be either the perfect husband or the perfect butler, he decided to be the perfect murderer instead. Wadsworth reports that he poisoned the champagne the guests had drunk earlier so they would soon die, leaving no witnesses. The police and the FBI arrive, and Wadsworth is arrested. He breaks free and steals a police car, but his escape is thwarted when three police dogs lunge from the back seat. This ending is documented in ''Clue: The Storybook'', a tie-in book released in conjunction with the film.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, pp. 57-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
[[Carrie Fisher]] was originally contracted to portray Miss Scarlet, but withdrew to enter treatment for drug and alcohol addiction.&lt;ref name = ewbad&gt;[http://movieline.com/2011/12/14/bad-movies-we-love-clue/ Bad Movies We Love: ''Clue'']&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Lynn's first choice for the role of Wadsworth was [[Leonard Rossiter]], but he died before filming commenced. The second choice was [[Rowan Atkinson]], but it was decided that he wasn't well known enough at the time, so Tim Curry was eventually cast.

===Filming===
''Clue'' was filmed on [[sound stage]]s at the [[Paramount Pictures]] film studios in Hollywood. The set design is credited to Les Gobruegge, Gene Nollmanwas, and William B. Majorand, with set decoration by Thomas L. Roysden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088930/fullcredits#cast | title=Full cast and crew for Clue (1985) | accessdate=2007-08-15 | publisher=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; To decorate the interior sets, authentic 18th and 19th century furnishings were rented from private collectors, including the estate of [[Theodore Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/| title=80s Rewind, Clue (1985)| accessdate=2007-08-15| publisher=www.fast-rewind.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completion, the set was bought by the producers of ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', who used it as the fictional hotel ''The Carlton''.

All interior scenes were filmed at the Paramount lot, with the exception of the ballroom scene. The ballroom, as well as the driveway gate exteriors, were filmed on location at a mansion located in [[South Pasadena, California]]. This site was destroyed in a fire on October 5, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/| title=Photos from Filming Location - 2003 | accessdate=2007-08-15| publisher=www.theartofmurder.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exterior shots of the Pasadena mansion were enhanced with [[matte painting]]s to make the house appear much larger, and these were executed by matte artist Syd Dutton, in consultation with [[Albert Whitlock]].

The color of each character's car is the same color as his or her playing piece from the original board game.

==Release==
The film was released theatrically on December 13, 1985. Theaters received one of the three endings, and some theaters announced which ending the viewer would see.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19851212/REVIEWS/512120301/1023 Clue Review] - Roger Ebert. December 12, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novelizations===
The [[novelization]] was written by [[Michael McDowell (author)|Michael McDowell]] based on the screenplay by Jonathan Lynn. There was also a children's adaptation entitled, ''Paramount Pictures Presents Clue: The Storybook'' written by Landis, Lynn, and [[Ann M. Martin|Ann Matthews]]. Both adaptations were published in 1985, and differ from the movie in that they feature a fourth ending cut from the final film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXhKPQAACAAJ |publisher=Google Books |title=Paramount Pictures Presents Clue: The Storybook |deadurl=no |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this ending, Wadsworth says that he killed Boddy as well as the other victims, and then reveals to the guests that he has poisoned them all so that there will be no witnesses and he will have committed the perfect crime. As he runs through the house to disable the phones and lock the doors, the chief detective – who had earlier been posing as an [[Cluedo characters#The Inspector|evangelist]] (Howard Hesseman) – returns, followed by the police, who disarm Wadsworth. Wadsworth then repeats the confession that he had given earlier to the guests, physically acting out each scene himself. When he arrives at the part about meeting Colonel Mustard at the door, he steps through the door, closes it, and locks it, leaving all the guests trapped inside. The police and guests escape through a window, while Wadsworth attempts to make a getaway in a [[police car|police squad car]], only to hear the growling of a [[Doberman Pinscher]] from the backseat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDowell|first=Michael|title=Paramount PIctures Presents Clue|year=1985|publisher=Fawcett Gold Medal|location=New York|isbn=0-449-13049-5|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Matthews |first=Ann |last2=Lynn |first2=Jonathan |last3=Landis |first3=John |title=Paramount PIctures Presents Clue: The Storybook |year=1985 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-671-61867-9 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
The movie was released to home video in [[VHS]] format in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] in 1986 and, on February 11, 1991, to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/clue/?dvd_ver=1#sell_thru_main |title=Clue Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on DVD in June 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/clue/?dvd_ver=7#sell_thru_main |title=Clue Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Blu-ray]] on August 7, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=8058 |title=Paramount Teases Four Upcoming Blu-ray Releases |publisher=Blu-ray.com |date=2012-01-18 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The home video, television broadcasts, and on-demand streaming by services such as [[Netflix]] include all three endings shown sequentially, with the first two characterized as possible endings but the third (Ending C) being the true one. The Blu-ray and DVD however, gives you the option to watch the endings separately (chosen randomly by the player), as well as the "home entertainment version" ending with all three of them stitched together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Clue Blu-ray|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Clue-Blu-ray/37011/|accessdate=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soundtrack===
In February 2011, La-La Land Records released John Morris' score for the film as a limited-edition soundtrack CD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lalalandrecords.com/Clue.html |title=La-La Land Records Clue Soundtrack |publisher=La-La Land Records |date= |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film was initially received with mixed reviews. Janet Maslin of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote negatively of the film and stated that the beginning "is the only part of the film that is remotely engaging. After that, it begins to drag."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C05E3DE143BF930A25751C1A963948260 |title='Clue,' from Game to Film |publisher= |date=December 13, 1985 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, writing, "''Clue'' offers a few big laughs early on followed by a lot of characters running around on a treadmill to nowhere."&lt;ref name=siskel&gt;{{cite news |first=Gene |last=Siskel |title=Did The Butler Do It? Clue Offers 3 Answers |newspaper=The Chicago Tribune |date=December 13, 1985 |page=A |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-12-13/entertainment/8503260263_1_outlying-theaters-star-john-morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Siskel particularly criticized the decision to release the film to theaters with three separate endings, calling it a "gimmick" that would distract audiences from the rest of the film, concluding that "''Clue'' is a movie that needs three different middles rather than three different endings."&lt;ref name=siskel /&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film a 2 out of 4 stars review, writing that despite a "promising" cast, the film's "screenplay is so very, very thin that [the actors] spend most of their time looking frustrated, as if they'd just been cut off right before they were about to say something interesting."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger (1985). "[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/clue-1985Clue review]", retrieved 2014-06-05&lt;/ref&gt; On [[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies]], both agreed that the "A" ending was the best while the "C" ending was the worst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siskel|first1=Gene|last2=Ebert|first2=Roger|title=At the Movies with Siskel &amp; Ebert|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP5c9AbfnR0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=19m7s|date=December 1985|quote=The best ending...is "A"...stay away from the worst which is "C".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film holds a 59% positive rating on the [[film-critic]]s aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 27 reviews, with an average score of 5.8/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/clue/ |title=Clue Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
''Clue'' has grossed $14.6 million in North America, just short of its $15,000,000 budget.&lt;ref name="Clue 1985"/&gt;

==Remake==
[[Universal Studios]] announced in 2011 that a new film based on the game was being developed. The film was initially dropped,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Katey Rich |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Clue-Movie-Dropped-By-Universal-But-Hasbro-Is-Still-Making-It-On-Their-Own-26034.html|title=Clue Movie Dropped By Universal, But Hasbro Is Still Making It On Their Own |publisher=Cinema Blend |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; then resumed as Hasbro teamed up with [[Gore Verbinski]] to produce and direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Michael Fleming |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000533.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Gore Verbinski to develop 'Clue' |publisher=Variety |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, The Tracking Board reports that Hasbro has landed at [[20th Century Fox]] with Josh Feldman producing for [[Hasbro Studios]] and Ryan Jones serving as the executive producer while Daria Cercek is overseeing for Fox. The film will be a "worldwide mystery" with action-adventure elements, potentially setting up a possible franchise that could play well internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tracking-board.com/20th-century-fox-gets-a-clue-and-will-produce-classic-board-game-remake-with-hasbro-exclusive/|title=20TH CENTURY FOX GETS A "CLUE" AND WILL PRODUCE CLASSIC BOARD GAME REMAKE WITH HASBRO (EXCLUSIVE)|publisher=The Tracking Board|last=Lyons|first=Josh|date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, Fox announced that [[Ryan Reynolds]], who had established a three-year [[first look deal]] with the studio, would star in a live-action remake of ''Clue'', with [[Rhett Reese]] and [[Paul Wernick]], writers for the Reynolds-led ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', its [[Deadpool 2|sequel]] and ''[[Life (2017 film)|Life]]'', as scriptwriters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2018/film/news/ryan-reynolds-clue-movie-fox-1202672829/ | title = Ryan Reynolds Signs First-Look Deal at Fox With 'Clue' Movie in the Works | author = Dave McNary| date = January 22, 2018 | accessdate = January 25, 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1300">The '''Drottningholm Music''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Drottningholmsmusiken'') is the popular name of the music that was composed by [[Johan Helmich Roman]] and first performed at [[Drottningholm Palace]] at [[Lovön]] near [[Stockholm]] on 18 August 1744 at the [[wedding]] of Crown Prince [[Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden|Adolf Frederick]] and Princess [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia]].

The music was composed especially for the royal wedding, and consists of 33 [[Movement (music)|movements]]. The movements are very different from each other; there is music both for ceremonious entries and for dance, for example [[minuet]]s. The wedding was celebrated in three days, under which the royal orchestra, directed by Roman, is believed to have been strengthened by the orchestra that Adolf Frederick had brought from Germany. The number of musicians was approximately 24.

[[File:USMC-110915-M-PH080-059.jpg|thumb|275px|U.S. Marines and sailors participate in an egg-toss competition at the Commissary Commando competition held at the Camp Foster commissary]]
'''Egg tossing''', '''egg toss''', or '''egg throwing''' is a [[game]] associated with [[Easter]]. The egg was a symbol of the rebirth of the [[earth]] in [[Pagan]] celebrations of spring and was adopted by early [[Christians]] as a symbol of the rebirth of man at Easter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/web/corporate/pages.nsf/Links/EA816EE5D35EB8258025714700320280/$file/History+of+the+Easter+Egg.pdf www.warwickshire.gov.uk The history of the Easter egg] Retrieved on 2008-03-17&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In one version of the game the idea is to toss an egg so it falls on the ground without breaking. This is possible on, for example, grassy [[meadows]].&lt;ref name=newall&gt;Venetia Newall (1971) ''An Egg at Easter: A Folklore Study'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=2KU9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA335&amp;dq=%22egg+tossing%22&amp;sig=uAGDiy2zc0kPi-WVq2yqYDQxhjM#PPA335,M1 p. 335]&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, children invented a way to spin the egg during the toss so that it lands on its tip still spinning.&lt;ref name=newall/&gt;

In [[medieval]] [[Great Britain|Britain]] there was an egg throwing festival held in the churches at Easter. The priest would give out one hard-boiled egg which was tossed around the [[nave]] of the church and the [[choirboy]] who was holding the egg when the clock struck twelve would get to keep it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2008/03/14/edeggs114.xml The Telegraph: Easter Eggs: time to get cracking]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch children play a game called "egg sales" in which one child sells an egg to another. The new owner then throws the egg in the grass and if it does not break it must be returned to the seller.&lt;ref name=newall/&gt;

Egg tossing is also known as a team competition with basically the following rules, although the exact details may vary. One member of a two-person team  tosses an egg to another. If the egg does not break, they step apart and the toss is repeated. The contest continues until one egg is left unbroken. (A popular variation uses [[water balloon]]s.)

On July 4, 2011, in [[Grangeville, Idaho]], the world record for the number of persons participating in an egg toss was set, with 2,130 persons participating.

An egg throwing feat was recorded in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'': on November 12, 1978 a Johnny Dell Foley successfully tossed a fresh hen's egg for a distance of 323&amp;nbsp;ft 2in (98.51m) to a Keith Thomas at [[Jewett, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Guinness Book of Records 1999'', {{ISBN|0-553-58075-2}}, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The record was undefeated until at least 1999. Since 2000 the feat is no longer listed in the book.

Since the world record in Egg Throwing has not been recorded in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' since 1999, the World Egg Throwing Federation, based in Swaton, England, now certifies official world records. The world record in Egg Throwing was held until May 19, 2013 by the Dutchmen Andries Smink and Hillebrand Visser with a certified distance of throw and catch of 69.5 meters (228.01837&amp;nbsp;ft) thrown on August 17, 2012. May 19, 2013 the Irish 'Wild' Willie O'Donevan and 'Big' Warren McElhone set a new world record at the Irish National Open of 71.2 meters.

WETF World Records:
- During the Dutch Open Egg Throwing championship, July 9, 2012, The Dutchmen Andries Smink (catcher) and Hillebrand Visser set an official WETF World Record at 61.50 meters

- On August 7, 2012 Andries Smink and Hillebrand Visser broke their own WETF World record and set it 69.25 meters

- A WETF World Record was set on May 19, 2013, during the Open Irish Eggthrowing at Ballinrobe, when "Wild" Willie O'Donovan (tosser) and Warren Mc Elhone (catcher) overcame a distance of 71.2 meters.

- During the Dutch Open Eggthrowing Championships, July 13, 2013 the world record was taken back by the Dutch, Andries Smink and Allard Adema covered a distance of 73.77 meters.

- A new official WETF World Record was set on May 23, 2014 by the brothers Andries and Bauke Jetze Smink, at 76.27 meters (250.22&amp;nbsp;ft). 

- The WETF World Record was taken from the Smink brothers during WETF World Championships 2017 on June 25 by the New Zealand team Robbie Hollander and Nick Hornstein with a distance of 81 meters (265.74 feet).

- The Hollander/Hornstein world record was broken on March 11, 2018 by Ricki Paewai and Kris Richards with a throw and catch at 85,96 meters.

The [[Hagerstown Suns]] have hosted the annual [[National Egg Toss Championship]] since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herald-mail.com/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=111148&amp;edition_id=713&amp;format=html "Egg-tossing event coming here"], ''[[The Herald-Mail]],'' April 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herald-mail.com/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=111477&amp;format=html "Teams scramble for title"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[World Egg Throwing Federation]] championship is held in [[Swaton]], England each year on the last Sunday in June since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/lincolnshire/content/articles/2009/06/15/egg_throwing09_feature.shtml "The Rowntree's Randoms Egg Throwing Championships - Swaton 28 June"] ''[[BBC]]''-[[Lincolnshire]], June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 and 2007 [[Disney Channel Games]] included egg tossing games.

'''''Evita, vida y obra de Eva Perón''''' ({{lang-es|Evita, life and work of Eva Perón}}) is an Argentine historical comic book by [[Héctor Germán Oesterheld]] and [[Alberto Breccia]], which narrates the biography of [[Eva Perón]]. It was censored at the time of creation and was published after Oesterheld's death.

==Editorial story==
The Argentine comic book authors [[Héctor Germán Oesterheld]] and [[Alberto Breccia]] started in 1968 a number of comic books devoted to the biographies of important people of Latin American history. The first issue was ''[[Vida del Che]]'' ({{lang-es|Life of Che}}), and it was about [[Che Guevara]]. When it was finished and published, they started working in one for Eva Perón. However, when Che's comic book was published, it was removed from distribution and all copies of it were destroyed. Facing such situation, Oesterheld stopped the whole project. Although Oesterheld had finished the script and Breccia the drawings, the production was not finished.&lt;ref&gt;"''Apenas Che apareció a la venta, Oesterheld comenzó a trabajar en el argumento de Evita y consecuentemente Breccia empezó con los dibujos. En medio de esto, Che fue retirado de la venta y los originales destruidos. Esta persecución obligó al editor a considerar abortado el proyecto y los autores, consecuentemente, lo abandonaron''" Doeyo, "Palabras del editor"&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Breccia received a new offer to draw a comic book about Eva Perón. It had a politically neutral script, whereas the one by Oesterheld had a radical peronist style. The art was the same than in the unpublished comic book, but being coloured, whereas the original was meant to be a black and white comic book.&lt;ref&gt;"''Entre 1969 y 1970 se editó con otro guionista y dibujo de Breccia, en una versión despolitizada, inconseguible hoy por hoy''". Martignone, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Oesterheld was [[Forced disappearance|disappeared]] in 1978 and Breccia died in 1993.

In 2002, the editor [[Javier Doeyo]] found the original script written by Oesterheld at the house of Breccia's widow, while searching for material for another project.&lt;ref&gt;"''en mayo de 2001 [...] me encontraba hurgando entre las carpetas de Breccia en casa de su viuda Irma, en busca del guión faltante de un capítulo de Buscavidas que estaba sin letrear. Para mi sorpresa [...] encuentro el argumento original de Oesterheld con el que Breccia empezó a trabajar y que por la cancelación del proyecto dejó de lado''" Doeyo, "Palabras del editor"&lt;/ref&gt; With this script, he could restore the original unpublished comic book. The art was already published as described, and the colours were removed to restore the originally intended black &amp; white by using image editing software. The script received minor corrections, fixing outdated information.&lt;ref name="panfleto"&gt;"''...actualizadas ciertas partes históricas (se recuperó el cadáver de Eva tras su abominable hurto [...]), la biografía es arrolladora y panfletaria, pero cuenta la historia de nuestro país''". Martignone, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the fate of Evita's corpse was still unknown in 1968, whereas by 2002 it had been recovered and placed at [[La Recoleta cemetery]].&lt;ref name="panfleto"/&gt;

The work was thus published in 2002 by [[Doedytores]]. In 2007 it was edited again by [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]], along with work about Che, as part of a series of reprints of noteworthy comic books.

==Description==
The comic book describes the life of Eva Perón in a biographical manner, from birth to death. It has a strong [[peronist]] point of view, and is highly critical of the military and other political forces.&lt;ref name="panfleto"/&gt; It does not employ the common techniques of the genre, and hasn't any [[speech balloon]]s or [[sequential art]]. The drawings are used merely to illustrate the events being described by the text. Alberto Breccia would explain that "''My work is testimonial, it can't be otherwise, because it includes characters like Goulart, Frondizi, Mao...''".&lt;ref&gt;"''Mi trabajo es testimonial, no podría ser de otra manera porque aparecían personajes como Goulart, Frondizi, Mao..." (Breccia) Doeyo, "Palabras del editor".&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pictures are made from famous photos or iconography of the time. For example, the first image (used by Doeyo to design the comic book cover) is based upon the cover of Evita's autobiography, ''[[La Razón de mi Vida]]''.

'''Festival Latinoamericano''', or ''Latin American Festival'', is an annual three-day [[Labor Day]] weekend festival in downtown [[Provo, Utah]]. The festival highlights [[Utah]]'s Hispanic culture through food, vendors, and performances and is free to the public. [[Centro Hispano]] hosts Festival Latinoamericano. It is currently in its fourteenth year.

==History and Purpose==
During the first year in 2001, the Festival was held at the Boulders Apartment Complex with about 75 attendants. The inaugural festival was a giant success, and quickly outgrew its South Provo location. The festival has since become a large yearly event in downtown Provo on the Utah County Historic Courthouse grounds on University Avenue and Center Street. In the last six years the festival has maintained an attendance of approximately 30,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centrohispanouc.org/FestivalLatinoamericano/tabid/197/language/en-US/Default.aspx Festival Background&lt;/ref&gt;

The Festival's purpose is to provide a venue for nonprofit organizations and new companies to provide their services to the Hispanic population. The audience at this event is not restricted to the state of Utah; there are visitors from multiple states including California, Wyoming, and Nevada.

The event showcases local performers of Latin dance and music, and also allows attendees to further explore Latin-American cuisine and culture through dozens of various vendors. Other attractions include carnival rides and [[lucha libre]].

'''Festival Welfare Services''' is a United Kingdom [[voluntary organisation]] established in 1972 to improve [[Public welfare|welfare service]]s at [[pop festival]]s. Prior to formation of FWS a variety of voluntary groups were providing services at festivals which, at the instigation of [[Release (agency)|Release]], came together to improve their cooperation and effectiveness. Following the [[Windsor Free Festival|Windsor]] and [[Watchfield#Watchfield Festival 1975|Watchfield]] festivals the government provided funding, from 1976, for a full-time worker (Penny Mellor) to coordinate FWS activities, although the majority of work remained voluntary. Volunteers often came from a festival-sympathetic background and thus were quite relaxed with even some of the wilder events but also sometimes distrusted by the authorities. Government funding was withdrawn in 1995.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5861">The '''Fiesta del Pacifico''' (English: ''Festival of the Pacific'') was a civic [[festival]] held in [[San Diego]], [[California]] during the 1950s. The event was staged throughout the city for several weeks in the mid to late summer. It was intended to attract tourists and to highlight San Diego's [[New Spain|Spanish]] and [[Mexico|Mexican]] heritage.

==History==
In 1955 the [[San Diego City Council]] approved a plan for a month-long celebration to take place in the summer of 1956.&lt;ref name = "Golden" /&gt; A private organization run by Wayne Dailard, who had served as manager of the 1936&amp;ndash;37 [[California Pacific International Exposition]], put on a 33-day-long event in 1956, with some financial support from the city and [[San Diego County|county]].&lt;ref name="Pourade"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pourade|first=Richard F. |title=City of the Dream 1940&amp;ndash;1970|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/books/pourade/dream/dreamchapter5.htm|year=1977|publisher=Copley Press|chapter=5: A Fiesta &amp;ndash; Reliving the days of the dons|ISBN=978-0913938195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fiesta was intended to be an annual event, but revenue projections fell short, and tourism industry representatives complained that it was drawing traffic away from the more established attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balboaparkhistory.net/glimpses/expohost.htm|title=Can San Diego hold a legitimate international exposition?|last=Amero|first=Richard W.|date=November 1999|pages=balboaparkhistory.net|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival continued for three more years but was shorter and less ambitious each year: July 18 to August 12 in 1956, July 24 to August 10 in 1957, August 29 to September 9 in 1958, and September 4 to 17 in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Fiesta-Pacifico-Official-Program-August/dp/B004O4M2LS|title=Fiesta del Pacifico San Diego Official Program July 18 Thru August 12, 1956|work=Fiesta|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "1957 program" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalpostercollection.com/travel/tourism/usa/1958-viva-la-fiesta-del-pacifico-san-diego/|title=1958 Viva La Fiesta del Pacifico!

==Description==
The festival included weeks of varied activities throughout the city, including a beauty pageant, several parades, a series of road races, a rodeo, street parties, and multiple displays of dancing, art, and other cultural activities. The main event was an epic theatrical production entitled ''The California Story,'' which had originally been written for the California Centennial celebration in 1950 and had been presented in the [[Hollywood Bowl]]. The extravaganza was performed in [[Balboa Stadium]] on a stage as long as a city block. It featured 35 scenes and a cast of 1,300 people, including a symphony orchestra and a 150-voice choir.&lt;ref name = "Pourade" /&gt; [[Lucille Norman]] was the star and lead singer in the 1957 production.&lt;ref&gt;"Fiesta Parade, Pageant Set Today," (July 27, 1957), p. 1, [[The San Diego Union]], [[San Diego, CA]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by [[Vladimir Rosing]] and conducted by [[Meredith Willson]]; both had filled the same role at the Hollywood Bowl.&lt;ref name = "program"&gt;Official Program, ''Fiesta del Pacifico'', San Diego, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/freeman/20020601-9999_1c1freeman.html|title='Music Man' still leads Broadway's hit parade|last=Freeman|first=Don|date=June 1, 2002|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production dramatized the history of California from the arrival of [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]] in 1540 through the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Golden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Starr|first=Kevin|title=Golden Dreams: California in an Age of Abundance, 1950&amp;ndash;1963|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gvFyunCAQbMC&amp;pg=PT84&amp;lpg=PT84&amp;dq=%22Fiesta+del+Pacifico%22+%22San+Diego%22|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-515377-4|page={{page needed|date=June 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was billed as "the biggest non-movie spectacle ever produced anywhere."&lt;ref name = "1957 program"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Diego-Fiesta-Pacifico-folder-1957/dp/B00EVUAMFS|title=San Diego Fiesta del Pacifico folder 1957|work=Program|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the last year of the fiesta, the ''California Story'' production was replaced by a 2-hour show called ''Stars over Pacific''.&lt;ref name = "timeline" /&gt;

==Legacy==
The celebration inspired the most popular and most-performed work by composer [[Roger Nixon]]: a piece for symphonic band called ''Fiesta del Pacifico''. It was composed in 1958&amp;ndash;59 and first performed in 1960. Nixon explained the name of his composition as follows: "Fiesta del Pacifico is held in San Diego and features a play on the history of the area, a parade, a rodeo, and street dances. It is one of several festivals held annually in various communities in California that celebrate the Old Spanish Days of the State, and I chose its name as representative of the spirit of those occasions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salzman|first=Timothy (ed.)|title=A Composer's Insight: Thoughts, Analysis and Commentary on Contemporary Masterpieces for Wind Band|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6lyqCsgVrYC&amp;pg=PA134|year=2006|publisher=Meredith Music Publications|pages=134–5|chapter=Roger Nixon, by William Berz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=January 2013}}
'''Financial intelligence''' ('''FININT''') is the gathering of information about the financial affairs of entities of interest, to understand their nature and capabilities, and predict their intentions.  Generally the term applies in the context of  law enforcement  and related activities.

One of the main purposes of financial intelligence is to identify [[financial transaction]]s that may involve [[tax evasion]], [[money laundering]] or some other criminal activity. FININT may also be involved in identifying financing of criminal and terrorist organisations.

Financial intelligence can be broken down into two main areas, collection and analysis.   Collection is normally done by a government agency, known as a financial intelligence organisation or Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).  The agency will collect raw transactional information and [[Suspicious activity report]]s (SAR) usually provided by banks and other entities as part of regulatory requirements.  Data may be shared with other countries through intergovernmental networks.  

Analysis, may consist of scrutinizing a large volume of transactional data using [[data mining]] or data-matching techniques to identify persons potentially engaged in a particular activity.  SARs can also be scrutinized and linked with other data to try and identify specific activity.

==Collection==
FININT involves scrutinizing a large volume of transactional data, usually provided by banks and other entities as part of regulatory requirements. Alternatively, [[data mining]] or data-matching techniques may be employed to identify persons potentially engaged in a particular activity.

Many industrialized countries have regulatory reporting requirements for its financial organisations. 

It may be possible for the FININT organization to obtain access to raw data at a financial organization. From a legal standpoint, this type of collection can be quite complex. For example, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] obtained access to the [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] (SWIFT) data streams through the [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]], but this violated Belgian privacy law.  

Reporting requirements may not affect [[Informal value transfer system]]s (IVTS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fincen.gov/advis33.pdf |author=United States Department of the Treasury, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network |title=Informal Value Transfer Systems, FinCEN Advisory Issue 33 |date=March 2003 |id=FinCEN-2003-33 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121142607/http://www.fincen.gov/advis33.pdf |archivedate=November 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of which may simply be customary in a culture, and of amounts that would not require reporting if in a conventional financial institution. IVTS also can be used for criminal purposes of avoiding oversight.

==Analysis==
Examples of financial intelligence analysis could include:
* Identifying high-[[risk]] housing tenants on the basis of past rental histories.
* Detecting tax payers trying to avoid their fiduciary obligations by moving wealth surreptitiously out of a tax-levying jurisdiction.
* Discovering [[tax haven|safe havens]] where criminals park the proceeds of [[crime]].
* Accounting for how a large sum of money handed to a targeted individual disappears
* Checking to see if a corrupt individual has had any sudden and unexplained windfalls.
* Detecting relationships between [[terrorist]] cells through remittances.

==Financial intelligence organizations==
According to the [[Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units]], financial intelligence organizations (FIUs) are national centres which collect information on suspicious or unusual financial activity from the financial industry and other entities or professions required to report transactions suspicious of being money laundering or terrorism financing. FIUs are normally not law enforcement agencies; their mission being to process and analyze the information received. If sufficient evidence of unlawful activity is found, the matter is passed to the public prosecution.&lt;ref name=Egmont&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an FIU?|url=http://www.egmontgroup.org/|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government organizations may simply receive and process raw financial reports, and forward them, as appropriate, to law enforcement or intelligence agencies, include the multinational Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, and national organizations, including:

* [[Argentina]] – [[Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera]] 
* [[Australia]] – [[Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre]] (AUSTRAC)
* [[Brazil]] – [[Council for Financial Activities Control|COAF]] Conselho de Controle de Atividade Financeira
* [[Canada]] – [[Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada]] (FINTRAC)

== United States examples ==
The United States has different organizations focused on domestic and international financial activity.
The United States has several laws requiring the reporting to the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|FinCEN]]. These include the [[Right to Financial Privacy Act]] (RFPA) of 1978, the [[Bank Secrecy Act]] of 1970 (and other names of revisions), and the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] of 1999 (GLBA). Some reports also need to go to the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]].

For example, the reports
{| class="wikitable"
&lt;Caption&gt;Representative Reports required from US financial institutions&lt;/caption&gt;
|-
! Report and definition
! Authority
! Receiving Agency
|-
| '''Currency Transaction Report (CTR)'''. Cash transactions in excess of $10,000 during the same business day. The amount over $10,000 can be either from one transaction or a combination of cash transactions.
| Bank Secrecy Act
| Internal Revenue Service
|-
| '''Negotiable Instrument Log (NIL)'''.	Cash purchases of negotiable instruments (e.g., money orders, cashiers checks, travelers cheques) having a face value of $3,000, or more.
| Bank Secrecy Act
| Internal Revenue Service
|-
|'''Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)'''.	Any cash transaction where the customer seems to be trying to avoid BSA reporting requirements (e.g., CTR, NIL). A SAR must also be filed if the customer's actions indicate that s/he is laundering money or otherwise violating federal criminal law. The customer must not know that a SAR is being filed.
| Bank Secrecy Act
| Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
|}

Actions that can trigger an SAR being filed include:
:#Any kind of insider abuse of a financial institution, involving any amount;
:#Federal crimes against, or involving transactions conducted through, a financial institution that the financial institution detects and that involve at least $5,000 if  a suspect can be identified, or at least $25,000 regardless of whether a suspect can be identified;
:#Transactions of at least $5,000 that the institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect involve funds from illegal activities or are structured to attempt to hide those funds;
:#Transactions of at least $5,000 that the institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect are designed to evade any regulations promulgated under the Bankruptcy Secrecy Act; or
:#Transactions of at least $5,000 that the institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect have no business or apparent lawful purpose or are not the sort  in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage and for which the institution knows of no reasonable explanation after due investigation.  The language of the RFPA indicates that a SAR filed under this rule comes from an individual transaction, not a profile of activities that make the transaction stand out.

===International===
International financial activity comes primarily from the Department of the Treasury and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. See [[CIA activities in Russia and Europe#Belgium 2006|CIA access]] to the [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] (SWIFT).

===US domestic FININT===
At the highest level, US domestic FININT, and also some international work, comes under the [[Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence]], heading the Office of Terrorism and Financial Analysis, including:
*[[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]]: tracks domestic transactions
*[[Office of Foreign Assets Control]]: focused on foreign assets in the US
*Office of Intelligence and Analysis

Information developed by these units, when related to domestic security and especially when state and local law enforcement, is disseminated by the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) in the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]], under the [[Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis]]. This Office is not restricted to FININT, but handles collection, analysis and fusion of intelligence throughout the entire Department. It disseminates intelligence throughout the Department, to the other members of the [[United States Intelligence Community]], and to affected [[first responder]]s at the state and local level.

Depending on the specific Federal violation, law enforcement investigation may be under agencies including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[United States Secret Service]], or the [[Internal Revenue Service]].

==Terrorist financing scenarios==

===Gems as an untraceable currency and source of income for terrorists===
Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] an allegation was made in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that [[tanzanite]] stones were being used as an untraceable currency and source of income for terrorists.  This has not since been firmly established.  See [[CIA Activities by Transnational Topic: Crime and Illicit Drug Trade#Conflict diamonds and militant financing|possible examples]].&lt;ref name=Farah2003&gt;{{cite web
| title = The Role of Conflict Diamonds and Failed States in the Terrorist Financial Structure
| author = Farah, Douglas
| publisher = The Watson Institute, Brown University
| date = 2003-10-24
| url = http://www.douglasfarah.com/articles/conflict-diamonds.shtml
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom common in Africa, uncut diamonds tend to be the de facto standard currency of the illicit small arms trade.  Diamonds may be easily counted with a uniform valuation per carat to people in places of the world where there are no automated teller machines.  An entire briefcase filled with uncut diamonds without the serial numbers found on refined precious metals can be used to make large illicit value transfers.  The practice coexists with human trafficking, narcotics, weapons dealing, terrorism, and the evasion of economic sanctions and embargoes.

However, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] has since instituted new [[anti-money laundering]] regulations to control the gem trade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=154465,00.html "New Requirement for the Precious Metal, Precious Stone, and Jewel Industries"], irs.gov.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213202653/https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0%2C%2Cid%3D154465%2C00.html |date=December 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Front-running the market in a terrorist attack===
Another intriguing possibility is that a terrorist might buy stocks which are likely to appreciate in the event of a terrorist attack, such as defense industry stocks, or sell short stocks which are likely to depreciate, such as airlines.  This possibility led to many investigations of the financial markets subsequent to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/chi-0109190296sep19,0,3496437.story "Terrorist trade probe widens: Options buying rose in firms that attack affected", by Robert Manor and Melissa Allison, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'',  September 19, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Financial Intelligence Unit Network ==
The Financial Intelligence Unit Network (FIU.NET) is a decentralized computer network that provides an information exchange between the financial intelligence units of the European Union.&lt;ref name="Van Duynen"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Georgios A.

All the connected FIUs have their FIU.NET equipment within their own premises and manage their own information. Through FIU.NET the connected FIUs create bilateral or multilateral cases. Ma&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;tch (autonomous, anonymous, analysis) is a matching tool within FIU.NET. Ma&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;tch makes it possible for FIUs to match names in order to find relevant data that is possessed by other connected FIUs. As the data is anonymized, there is no breaching of privacy and data protection rules.

===Connected FIUs===
FIU.NET is funded by the European Commission and participating FIUs.&lt;ref name="DG HOME"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundings|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/financing/fundings/projects/stories/fiu_net_en.htm|work=European Commission|publisher=European Commission - DG Home Affairs (HOME)|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the connected EU Member State FIUs are:&lt;ref name="FIU.NET website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Parties involved|url=http://www.fiu.net/home/parties-involved|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

[[File:The Fine Art Society 9906158113.jpg|thumb|The Fine Art Society, London]]
The '''Fine Art Society''' is a gallery in Dundas Street in [[Edinburgh]]'s [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] (originally Bourne Fine Art, established 1978). The [[New Bond Street]], [[London]] gallery closed its doors in August 2018 after being occupied by The Fine Art Society since February 1876, the entrance facade of which was built in 1881 by [[Edward William Godwin]] (1833–1886).

==History==
Founded in 1876 by a group of like-minded men led by William Longman of the publishing family, [[Marcus Bourne Huish]] (1843–1904), lawyer, editor, writer and collector, who became the first Managing Director while at the same time editing ''[[The Art Journal]]''; and [[Archibald Stuart-Wortley (politician)|Archibald Stuart-Wortley MP]].  The gallery, first managed by Ernest Brown (later founder of [[Leicester Galleries]]) has for many years largely concentrated on British art and design from 1600 to the present day; with the Edinburgh premises specialising in Scottish art of the same period. The Edinburgh branch of the company is directed by Emily Walsh.  The Chairmen were all drawn from the Longman family until the death of Mark Longman in 1972. Since then only Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden KT (until 1998), Sir Angus Grossart (until 2016) and Robin Holland-Martin (current) have held the position. Only seven people have held the position of Managing Director in the past 139 years, the last being Pippa Stockdale.

The Fine Art Society has taken part in key international art fairs over the years, most notably at [[TEFAF]] Maastricht, Masterpiece, London, [[Frieze Masters]], London and at the [[London Original Print Fair]], whose founder and chairman, Gordon Cooke, is also the society's 19th and 20th century prints specialist. The society has also exhibited in art fairs in New York, Miami, Hong Kong, Paris and Dubai.

==Exhibitions==
The gallery is also known as the pioneer of the one-man exhibition, most famously that of [[James McNeill Whistler]]'s First Venice Set of etchings in December 1880; the gallery having sent Whistler to [[Venice]] in 1879 in part to enable him to escape from the issues following his libel action against [[John Ruskin]]. The commission was for Whistler to travel to Venice for three months to create a series of twelve etchings. Beguiled by the city, he stayed for fourteen months and completed approximately fifty etchings. Venice also inspired Whistler to make some hundred works in pastel, of which 53 were shown in the Venice Pastels exhibition in 1881. During Whistler's absence in Venice, the gallery showed his antagonist John Ruskin's private Collection of Watercolours by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and ran a subscription to pay for Ruskin's legal costs: a supreme exhibition of political sleight of hand. Other living exhibitors at the London premises included [[Sir John Everett Millais]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Burne-Jones]], [[Frank Brangwyn]], [[Walter Richard Sickert]], [[Walter Crane]], [[George Washington Lambert]], [[Henry Charles Brewer]] and [[Joseph Southall]], and more recently [[Leonard Rosoman]], Emma Sargent, [[Emily Young]], [[John Byrne (playwright)|John Byrne]], [[Alexander Stoddart]] and Geoffrey Clarke.  Of many memorial exhibitions held,  one was for [[Lady Alma Tadema]] in 1910.

A Contemporary gallery was created in 2005, originally managed by Toby Clarke, subsequently by [[Kate Bryan]], and most recently by Lee Cavaliere. Sara Terzi is now the Contemporary art specialist at the gallery. The Contemporary team have embraced the nineteenth and twentieth century heritage of the gallery and increased cross-cultural links, particularly in Asia, Australia and the US. Among the artists shown are [[Chris Levine]], Angela Palmer, [[Annie Kevans]], [http://thefineartsociety.com/artists/35-jacky-tsai/overview/ Jacky Tsai] and [http://thefineartsociety.com/artists/27-bartholomew-beal/overview/ Bartholomew Beal].

In October 2014 The Fine Art Society Contemporary staged the first exhibition to be held at the gallery across all 5 floors, 'What Marcel Duchamp Taught Me.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://howtospendit.ft.com/art/65691-what-marcel-duchamp-taught-me|title = What Marcel Duchamp Taught Me|website = How To Spend It|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/09/marcel-duchamp-exhibition-celebrate-father-conceptual-art|title = Marcel Duchamp: exhibition to celebrate father of conceptual art|last = Brown|first = Mark|date = 2014-10-09|last2 = correspondent|first2 = arts|newspaper = The Guardian|language = en-GB|issn = 0261-3077|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition featured artwork by 50 contemporary global artists including [[Peter Blake (artist)|Sir Peter Blake]], [[Cornelia Parker]], [[Gavin Turk]], [[Chris Levine]], [[Conrad Shawcross]], [[Keith Tyson]], [[Michael Craig-Martin]], [[Jonathan Yeo]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Idris Khan]], [[Annie Kevans]] and [[Charming Baker.]] The exhibition curated by [[Kate Bryan]] was one of the most successful in the history of the gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/artists-to-pay-respects-to-marcel-duchamp-in-new-exhibition-9773803.html|title = Artists to pay respects to the revolutionary Marcel Duchamp in new|website = The Independent|language = en-GB|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marked 100 years since [[Marcel Duchamp]] created the [[Found object|readymade]].

{{Wiktionary|FOAF}}
In [[sociology]], a '''friend of a friend''' is a human contact that exists because of a mutual friend. Person C is a friend of a friend of person A when there is a person B that is a [[friend]] of both A and C. Thus the human relation "friend of a friend" is a compound relation among friends, similar to the [[uncle]] and [[aunt]] relations of [[kinship]]. Though friendship is a [[symmetric relation|reciprocal relation]], the relation of a friend of a friend may not be a friendship, though it holds potential for coalition building and dissemination of information.

==Balance theory==
{{Main|Balance theory}}
The tendency of a friend of a friend to become a friend was noted by [[Fritz Heider]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritz Heider]] (1946) "Attitudes and Cognitive Organization", [[The Journal of Psychology]] 21: 107 to 21&lt;/ref&gt; though he also considered the possibility that one of the friendships might breakdown, according to ''balance theory'', which his view of human triangles is called. According to Heider, the friend of a friend contact could be stressful enough to undermine one or another of the friendships. Extending the study of social dynamics caused by such friend-of-a-friend tensions to social networks beyond triangles, D. Cartwright and [[Frank Harary]] used [[signed graph]]s to indicate positive or negative sentiments between persons.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, D. and [[Frank Harary]] (1956)[http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/cartwright56balance.pdf Structural balance: a generalization of Heider's theory],  [[Psychological Review]] 63: 277–293 link from [[Stanford University]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 [[Anatol Rapoport]] summarized the theory: "The hypothesis implies roughly that attitudes of the group members will change is such a way that one's friends' friends will tend to become one's friends, ..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Anatol Rapoport]] (1963) "Mathematical models of social interaction", in [https://archive.org/details/handbookofmathem017893mbp ''Handbook of Mathematical Psychology'', v. 2], pp 493 to 580, especially 541, editors: R.A. Galanter, R.R. Lace, E. Bush, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1975 [[Dartmouth College]] offered a symposium&lt;ref&gt;Paul W. Holland &amp; Samuel Leinhardt (editors) (1979) ''Perspectives on Social Network Research'', [[Academic Press]] {{ISBN|9780123525505}}&lt;/ref&gt; on these dynamics.

Bo Anderson made an analysis of the friend-of-a-friend relationship in connection with his criticism of balance theory.&lt;ref&gt;Bo Anderson (1979) "Cognitive Balance Theory and Social Network Analysis: Remarks on some fundamental theoretical matters", pages 453–69 in ''Perspectives on Social Network Research'', editors: Paul W. Holland &amp; Samuel Leinhardt, [[Academic Press]], see page 458.&lt;/ref&gt;
:We have all encountered cases in which somebody has said, "You should meet so-and-so", only to find that we have little in common with that person, even though he or she was introduced to us by a mutual friend...In ''some'' friendships the persons value the exclusiveness of their relationship and are therefore not likely to let others into it. Friends differ from acquaintances in that they are not merely slots in a grid of social network relationships, but are valued for their personal, ''unique'' qualities. Hence, when I relate to a friend of a friend, I need to know something about the perceptions and exchanges that make up this friendship. My reaction to my friend's friend (or spouse) may even be ''unfavorable'', although I may ''also'' well understand and sympathize with my friend’s affection for her, given ''his'' needs, perceptions, interests and so on. 

Considering [[friendship]] between people to be a [[binary relation]], the connection to a friend of a friend is a [[composition of relations|composition]] of the relationship with itself. Composed relations are used to describe [[kinship#Composition of relations|kinship]], so it may be natural to apply composition to friendship. One consequence is that frequently a person's friends have more friends than him (the [[friendship paradox]]), which accents the reach of the compound connection. But the fact that friendship is not automatically a [[transitive relation]] produces some social dynamics.

==Meme==
'''Friend of a friend''' ('''FOAF''') is a phrase used to refer to someone that one does not know well, literally, a friend of a friend.

In some [[social sciences]], the phrase is used as a half-joking shorthand for the fact that much of the information on which people act comes from distant sources (as in "It happened to a friend of a friend of mine") and cannot be confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goodreau SM, Kitts JA, Morris M |title=Birds of a feather, or friend of a friend?

The acronym ''FOAF'' was coined by [[Rodney Dale]] and used in his 1978 book ''The Tumour in the Whale: A Collection of Modern Myths''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Urban Legends, Updated and Expanded Edition|first=Jan Harold|last=Brunvand|authorlink=Jan Harold Brunvand|page=241|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9xOb-19lXx8C&amp;pg=PA241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gaskell Ball''' is a [[Victorian era|Victorian]]-styled [[Ball (dance)|ball]] held by Ye Gaskell Occasional Dance Society in [[Oakland, California]], United States, popular among historical re-creationists and [[vintage dance]] enthusiasts.

The ball came to be over 25 years ago, as an offshoot of a dance portion of the Great Dickens Christmas Fair held in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ye Gaskell Occasional Dance Society|author=Liz Scott|publisher=Santa Cruz Sentinel, The Guide|date=16 February 2007|url=http://adserver1.harvestadsdepot.com/stcruzsentnl/ss/059096/014/014_001/014_001.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was held at [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]'s Scottish Rite Center on the shore of [[Lake Merritt]] every two months through the end of 2014. Due to the increased costs of the hall, the event has become less frequent; only one ball was held in 2015, in October.  Music for the event is provided by "Brassworks", a popular local band. The evening  includes a basic vintage waltz lesson for early attendees and some small potluck refreshments.  Dances are taught during a brief course before the ball begins, and include vintage [[waltz]], [[schottische]], [[polka]], [[mazurka]], and several [[English country dance]]s.  Occasionally, groups will form on the sidelines to dance alternate arrangements to the English Country songs; previous examples include [[Irish dance|Irish four-hand reels]], the [[Scottish country dance]] "Petronella", the [[Virginia reel (dance)|Virginia reel]], and various [[Contra dance]]s.  Full Victorian dress is not required; the dress code is formal wear of the nineteenth or twentieth centuries. A minimum of semi-formal attire is requested by the ball staff.  Although seldom exercised, the staff reserves the right to refuse entrance to those who are inappropriately attired.  There are occasional performances by local dance troupes during the intermission, however there is no official dance group affiliated with the ball.

The Gaskell Ball is a favorite among dancers from the [[Stanford]], [[UC Berkeley]] and [[UC Santa Cruz]] social dance circles, and is widely credited for popularizing John Hertz's ''[[Congress of Vienna Waltz]]'' and [[Richard Powers (dance historian)|Richard Powers]]' ''[[Bohemian National Polka]]'' choreographies.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==History==
The Gaskell Ball is named for the British writer [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]. The Gaskell Ball originated in 1979, when the troupe playing the Gaskell family at the [[The Great Dickens Christmas Fair and Other Victorian Holiday Party|Charles Dickens Fair]] decided to hold a ball in her honor. The first ball was held at [[Mills College]], a women's college in Oakland. In proceeding years it was held at the Veterans' Auditorium in Oakland. In the 1990s the ball outgrew the hall and was moved to accommodate the increased attendance.

"'''Get Your Gunn'''" is a song by American rock band [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], released as the [[lead single]] from their debut [[studio album]], ''[[Portrait of an American Family]]'' (1994). The song was written by the band's [[Marilyn Manson|eponymous vocalist]] along with original guitarist and bassist [[Daisy Berkowitz]] and [[Gidget Gein]], respectively, and was [[Record producer|produced]] by Manson with [[Trent Reznor]]. "Get Your Gunn" was inspired by the [[murder of David Gunn|murder]] of [[abortion in the United States|abortion]]ist [[David Gunn (doctor)|David Gunn]] by a [[United States pro-life movement|pro-life]] activist, an event which angered Manson.

A [[gothic rock]] and [[hard rock]] song, the track received a mostly positive response from music critics, who described it as both nightmarish and well-produced, while Manson garnered acclaim for his vocal performance. The song features [[saxophone]] played by [[Sugarsmack]] vocalist [[Hope Nicholls]], and an audio sample of the televised suicide of [[R. Budd Dwyer]]. According to Berkowitz, the writing of the song marked a change of direction for Manson, after which he began to write more politically-charged songs. "Get Your Gunn" was blamed by the [[far-right politics|far-right]] in the United States for the [[Columbine High School massacre]], and multiple critics have deemed it one of the most controversial songs of all time. Its [[music video]] was directed by Rod Chong and released in 1994. The clip garnered acclaim from critics, and the song reached number 11 on the [[Canadian Hot 100]], three years after its initial release.

==Background and release==
[[File:Michael Griffin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|Michael Frederick Griffin (''pictured'') [[Murder of David Gunn|murdered David Gunn]]; the murder inspired "Get Your Gunn".]]
Abortionist [[David Gunn (doctor)|David Gunn]] was [[Murder of David Gunn|shot and killed in 1993]] at an anti-abortion protest by Michael Frederick Griffin, a [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]]. At his trial, Griffin claimed to have been manipulated into killing Gunn by John Burt, a [[United States pro-life movement|pro-life]] leader and former member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Gunn's death was, in the words of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''{{'}}s [[Dahlia Lithwick]], "the first targeted killing of an abortion doctor in America".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/14/us/the-clinic-gunman-and-the-victim-abortion-fight-reflected-in-2-lives.html |title=The Clinic Gunman and the Victim: Abortion Fight Reflected in 2 Lives |author=Sara Rimer |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 14, 1993 |accessdate=January 17, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428002621/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/14/us/the-clinic-gunman-and-the-victim-abortion-fight-reflected-in-2-lives.html |archivedate=April 28, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/10/michael-frederick-griffin-killed-an-abortion-doctor-he-could-soon-be-a-free-man.html| last=Lithwick| first=Dahlia| title=The Murderer Who Started a Movement| publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''| date=October 31, 2017| accessdate=January 17, 2018| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102203809/https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/10/michael-frederick-griffin-killed-an-abortion-doctor-he-could-soon-be-a-free-man.html| archivedate=November 2, 2017| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murder inspired "Get Your Gunn", hence the spelling of the song's title. Manson told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 1999 that Gunn's death "was the ultimate hypocrisy I witnessed growing up: that these people killed someone in the name of being 'prolife.'"&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;

Manson has said that the murder "almost made me laugh, but it made me mad. When you think about it, it's so fucking backwards, despite the whole Christian belief of [[Matthew 5:44|love thy enemy]] and all that."&lt;ref name=pheonix&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/marilyn-manson-i-like-to-smoke-and-hang-out-with-the-gangsta-rappers-6615701| last=Louvau| first=Jim| title=Marilyn Manson: "I Like To Smoke and Hang Out With The Gangsta Rappers"| publisher=''[[Phoenix New Times]]''| date=May 30, 2013| accessdate=January 17, 2018| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319044000/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/marilyn-manson-i-like-to-smoke-and-hang-out-with-the-gangsta-rappers-6615701| archivedate=March 19, 2016| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When writing the track, Manson also drew inspiration from his longtime fascination with [[abortion]].&lt;ref name=book/&gt;  Commenting on both "Get Your Gunn" and "[[Lunchbox (song)|Lunchbox]]", Manson noted that "The somewhat positive messages of these songs are usually the ones that sensationalists misinterpret as promoting the very things I am decrying."&lt;ref name=rs&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Marilyn Manson|title=Columbine: Whose Fault Is It?|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|issue=815|date=June 24, 1999|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/columbine-whose-fault-is-it-19990624|access-date=April 10, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721192522/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/columbine-whose-fault-is-it-19990624|archivedate=July 21, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When deciding the direction of ''Portrait of an American Family'', Manson and band-mate [[Scott Putesky|Daisy Berkowitz]] deicided that it would comment on what they saw as the hypocrisy of the U.S. media. Discussing "Get Your Gunn" with ''[[Vice (magazine)|Noisey]]'' in 2014, Berkowitz said: "When we started out [Manson's lyricism] was more psychedelic. It was weirdness. We played up weirdness rather than anything socially pointed. We got more social and political as things went on. Like with our song, 'Get Your Gunn' that definitely wasn't something that we started out doing."&lt;ref name=vice&gt;{{cite web| url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/65aab6/daisy-berkowitz-marilyn-manson-scott-putesky-interview-1| last=Tron| first=Gina| title=Daisy Berkowitz: Portrait of an American Ex-Marilyn Manson Member| publisher=''[[Vice (magazine)|Noisey]]''| date=April 14, 2014| accessdate=January 17, 2018| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113124905/https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/65aab6/daisy-berkowitz-marilyn-manson-scott-putesky-interview-1| archivedate=November 13, 2017| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manson has said that "Get Your Gunn" is his favorite song from ''Portrait of an American Family''.&lt;ref name=pheonix/&gt; Manson told the ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' that "What's great is that ["Get Your Gunn"] is the most uncommercial track, the most politically incorrect."&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; "Snake Eyes and Sissies" was originally planned to be the band's debut single, but "Get Your Gunn" was released instead&lt;ref name=team/&gt; on June 9, 1994.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt; The single featured "Get Your Gunn" and "Misery Machine", another song from ''Portrait of an American Family'', as well as two other tracks: "Mother Inferior Got Her Gunn" and "Revelation #9". The titles of the two latter songs are puns based on songs from the [[The Beatles (album)|White Album]].&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt; The child pictured on the sleeve for the disc is Wes Brown, the half-brother of [[Twiggy Ramirez]].&lt;ref name=twiggy&gt;{{cite book |first=Kurt |last=Reighley |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LZtVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=noisey+manson+get+your+gunn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vRh-BikqYH&amp;sig=d7t1kZbL61KLhbrB7rwXacrOAyY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGmo2zt-DYAhXM0FMKHTNgANwQ6AEITTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=wes%20brown&amp;f=false |title=Marilyn Manson |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |date=April 15, 1998 |page=45 |accessdate=2018-01-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120234007/https://books.google.com/books?id=LZtVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=noisey+manson+get+your+gunn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vRh-BikqYH&amp;sig=d7t1kZbL61KLhbrB7rwXacrOAyY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGmo2zt-DYAhXM0FMKHTNgANwQ6AEITTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=wes%20brown&amp;f=false |archivedate=January 20, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Get Your Gunn" is a [[gothic rock]]&lt;ref name=goth/&gt; and [[hard rock]] song&lt;ref name=stereogum/&gt; with a length of three minutes and eighteen seconds.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt; The song's lyrics were written by the band's [[Marilyn Manson|eponymous vocalist]], while its music was written by [[Scott Putesky|Daisy Berkowitz]] and [[Gidget Gein]]; the track was produced by Manson and [[Trent Reznor]].&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; The aforementioned murder is reflected in its lyrics "God damn your righteous hand/ I eat innocent meat/ The housewife I will beat/ The prolife I will kill".&lt;ref name=gigwise/&gt; Alec Chillingworth of ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' found the song's "wacky, stomping hook" reminiscent of the music of [[Jack Off Jill]].&lt;ref name=jack/&gt;

Joseph Schafer of ''[[Stereogum]]'' described Manson's vocals on the track as raspy and unpolished, as well as reminiscent of [[Maynard James Keenan]]'s vocals on [[Tool (band)|Tool]]'s EP ''[[Opiate (EP)|Opiate]]'' (1992).&lt;ref name=stereogum/&gt; Schafer saw similarities between the riff in the song's verses and the music of [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]], and thought that the [[snare drum]]s and [[cymbals]] in the song's chorus evoke the work of artists signed to [[Wax Trax! Records]], particularly [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]].&lt;ref name=stereogum/&gt; The chorus of "Get Your Gunn" is "Goddamn/oh Lord/ goddamn".&lt;ref name=twiggy/&gt; The bridge of "Get Your Gunn" includes audio from the televised [[press conference]] where American politician [[R.

==Critical reception and controversy==
[[File:Robin Thicke 2012 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|"Get Your Gunn" created controversy comparable to that sparked by "[[Blurred Lines]]" (2013) by [[Robin Thicke]].]]
Schafer of ''Stereogum'' ranked the song eighth on his list of "The 10 Best Marilyn Manson Songs", saying that "While the remainder of ''Portrait Of An American Family'' comes across as undercooked, even for an early-'90s alt-metal album, 'Get Your Gunn' feels lean and vitriolic. Sadly, Manson seldom matched its aggression again." Schafer also praised Manson's "charming" vocal performance on the song.&lt;ref name=stereogum&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.stereogum.com/1792094/the-10-best-marilyn-manson-songs/franchises/10-best-songs/| last=Schafer| first=Joseph| title=The 10 Best Marilyn Manson Songs| publisher=''[[Stereogum]]''| date=April 5, 2015| accessdate=December 17, 2017| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709164025/http://www.stereogum.com/1792094/the-10-best-marilyn-manson-songs/franchises/10-best-songs/| archivedate=July 9, 2017| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Louvau of the ''Phoenix New Times'' named it one of his favorite Marilyn Manson songs alongside "[[Long Hard Road Out of Hell]]" (1997).&lt;ref name=pheonix/&gt; [[Bloody Disgusting]]'s [[Brad Miska]] opined that "In retrospect, its level of cheese is of legend, but in 1994 ''Portrait'' was some dark and weird shit (see 'Cake and Sodomy', 'My Monkey', 'Get Your Gun' {{sic}}, etc.)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3324933/from-worst-to-best-marilyn-mansons-albums/3/| last=Miska| first=Brad| title=[Ranked] Marilyn Manson’s Albums!| publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]| date=April 19, 2014| accessdate=January 16, 2018| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814174231/http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3324933/from-worst-to-best-marilyn-mansons-albums/3/| archivedate=August 14, 2017| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Gigwise]]'' said that the song has "brutal" lyrics which "set the precedent for the rest of the band's career".&lt;ref name=gigwise&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.gigwise.com/photos/56046/The-20-Most-Controversial-Songs-Of-All-Time| title=The 20 Most Controversial Songs Of All Time| publisher=''[[Gigwise]]''| date=April 26, 2010| accessdate=January 18, 2018| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401013658/https://www.gigwise.com/photos/56046/The-20-Most-Controversial-Songs-Of-All-Time| archivedate=April 1, 2016| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandra Schulman of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' said that the song is "Horrifyingly good, loopy music, with discordant riffs that crawl under your skin and stay there.

In America, the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] blamed the [[Columbine High School massacre]] on "Get Your Gunn"; Manson responded to this claim by saying that "In my work I examine the America we live in, and I've always tried to show people that the devil we blame our atrocities on is really just each one of us." Due to its association with the Columbine massacre, Daisy Jones of ''Dazed'' placed "Get Your Gunn" on her list of the most controversial songs of all time, though she deemed the association absurd. Jones wrote that the song created an amount of controversy comparable to that sparked by "[[Fuck tha Police]]" (1988) by [[N.W.A]] and "[[Blurred Lines]]" (2013) by [[Robin Thicke]].&lt;ref name=dazed/&gt; Similarly, a [[PRS for Music]] survey conducted in 2010 revealed that the British public considered "Get Your Gunn" the eighth most controversial song of all time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |date=23 November 2010 |title=Ozzy, Manson, Rage Make Top Ten Controversial Songs List |url=http://www.prsformusic.com/aboutus/press/latestpressreleases/Pages/UKPublicVotesProdigySongAsMostControversial.aspx |publisher=[[PRS for Music]] |accessdate=2011-09-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828191525/http://www.prsformusic.com/aboutus/press/latestpressreleases/Pages/UKPublicVotesProdigySongAsMostControversial.aspx |archivedate=28 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Schafer of ''Stereogum'' noted in 2015 that it was "still one of the most controversial songs in Manson’s repertoire".&lt;ref name=stereogum/&gt; ''Gigwise'' ranked the track fifteenth on their list of "The 20 Most Controversial Songs of All Time".&lt;ref name=gigwise/&gt;

==Music video==
The music video, directed by Rod Chong, features Manson performing in an abandoned house. It is one of four Marilyn Manson music videos where the band's frontman has eyebrows.&lt;ref name=team&gt;{{cite web| url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-01-05/the-13-best-marilyn-manson-videos| last=Young| first=Simon| title=The 13 best Marilyn Manson videos| publisher=[[Metal Hammer|Team Rock]]| date=January 5, 2016| accessdate=January 18, 2018| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119001152/http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-01-05/the-13-best-marilyn-manson-videos| archivedate=January 19, 2018| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was accepted by MTV. Although it was rarely aired by the network, it was shown on ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''. Manson told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that MTV wanted to censor the use of the word "goddamn" in the track's chorus, commenting "They wanted the word God bleeped, which is assbackward because damn is the cussword."&lt;ref name=twiggy/&gt; The clip focuses on Manson's eyes, and features imagery of light coming in through windows.&lt;ref name=sun/&gt;

Simon Young of [[Metal Hammer|Team Rock]] called the "Get Your Gunn" video one of the band's "classic videos".&lt;ref name=team/&gt; Sandra Shulman of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' called the video "a searing and tight piece of work".&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; Dan Epstein of ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' wrote that "Marilyn Manson might be best known as a musician, but he's also made his mark as a video artist, simultaneously captivating and disgusting viewers since 1994's 'Get Your Gunn' clip all the way up to this year's nympho-nuns-with-guns visual '[[We Know Where You Fucking Live]]'."&lt;ref name=revolver&gt;{{cite web|work= [[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]|url= https://www.revolvermag.com/culture/5-most-horrifying-moments-marilyn-manson-music-videos#1-beautiful-people-1996|first= Dan|last= Epstein|title= 5 Most Horrifying Moments From Marilyn Manson Music Videos|date= July 17, 2014|accessdate= December 10, 2017|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171211104958/https://www.revolvermag.com/culture/5-most-horrifying-moments-marilyn-manson-music-videos#1-beautiful-people-1996|archivedate= December 11, 2017|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MTV]]'s Rob Mancini viewed the video for "Get Your Gunn" as one of Marilyn Manson's "early nuggets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1431699/marilyn-manson-plans-live-album-home-video/| last=Mancini| first=Rob| title=Marilyn Manson Plans Live Album, Home Video| publisher=[[MTV]]| date=September 7, 1999| accessdate=January 17, 2018| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118122613/http://www.mtv.com/news/1431699/marilyn-manson-plans-live-album-home-video/| archivedate=January 18, 2018| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grampians Grape Escape''' is one of the longest running food and wine festivals in Australia and a hallmark event for Victoria. It was launched in 1992.

Held in the [[Grampians National Park]] at [[Halls Gap]] during the first weekend of May every year, the Grampians Grape Escape provides food and wine offerings by more than 100 local artisan producers, live music and family entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vic.gov.au/news/2014-grampians-grape-escape.html|title=2014 Grampians Grape Escape|work=www.vic.gov.au|accessdate=31 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205213229/http://www.vic.gov.au/news/2014-grampians-grape-escape.html|archivedate=5 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grampians Wine ==
The festival features [[Grampians_(wine)]] produced by some of the oldest vines in the word; the area was first vinified in 1862 with plantings at Concongella Creek and Great Western by French winemaker Charles Pierlot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grampianswine.com.au/wine_region.html|title=grampians wine... nothing short of spectacular! - wine region|work=grampianswine.com.au|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each year participating wineries select a parcel of wine from the year's vintage for inclusion in the special release Grampians Reserve Shiraz, which is auctioned exclusively at the Festival. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweeklyadvertiser.com.au/2011/04/27/winemakers-set-for-20th-auction/|title=Winemakers set for 20th auction|work=theweeklyadvertiser.com.au|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grape Stomping ==
Up to a tonne of grapes are donated to the Festival each year by local vineyards and picked by school students for a traditional grape stomping competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.araratadvertiser.com.au/story/2284326/grape-stomp-a-premier-event/|title=Grape Stomp a premier event|author=Fairfax Regional Media|date=15 May 2014|work=The Ararat Advertiser|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Festival commenced in 1992 as the Halls Gap Gourmet Weekend and was rebranded as Grampians Grape Escape in 2002. It celebrated its 21st year over 5–6 May 2012 and has grown to attract a crowd of up to 10,000 foodies from across the world. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winecompanion.com.au/news/news-articles/2012/february/grampians-grape-escape-celebrates-21-years-of-indulgence|title=Grampians Grape Escape celebrates 21 years of home-grown wine and food indulgence|work=winecompanion.com.au|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous Festival identities have included: [[Manu Feildel]], [[Poh Ling Yeow]], [[Tobie Puttock]], [[Ed Halmagyi]], [[Rachel Berger]], [[Rebecca Barnard]], [[Monique Brumby]], Adrian Richardson and Stefano de Pieri. 

==Recognition==
The Festival is recommended by [[Australian Traveller]] as one of Australia’s top 30 wine and beer festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiantraveller.com/post/30-australian-wine-beer-cider-festivals/|title=30 Australian wine &amp; beer festivals definitely worth a taste|work=Australian traveller magazine|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2652">[[Image:Neck-procession.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Guldize procession with "neck" Penzance 2008]]'''Guldize''', Gooldize or Goel dheys (sometimes dicklydize or Nickly Thize) is the harvest festival of the [[Cornish people]]. Guldize is Cornish language for "the feast of ricks" (i.e., grain stacks). The festival itself was held at the end of the [[wheat]] harvest and took the form of a vast feast usually around the time of the [[Equinox|autumnal equinox]]. The ceremony of [[Crying The Neck]] took place before the feast, the neck being formed into a [[Corn dolly]], which presided over the celebrations.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;AK Hamilton Jenking ''Cornish Homes and Customs'' 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008 a revived Guldize celebration has been held in Penzance and since 2010 in several other locations across Cornwall.

==Historical description==
[[A. K. Hamilton Jenkin]] wrote in his book ''Cornish Homes and Customs'',
{{quote|On the evening of the day on which the neck was cut the harvesters would repair to the farmhouse kitchen. Here numerous company in addition to farmers own family would sit down to a substantial meal of broiled pork and potatoes, the second course consisted of Apple pie, cream and 'fuggans' the whole being washed down with cider and spirits.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;}}

The playing of music and communal singing followed sometimes throughout the night.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; A number of songs in particular have been recorded as being sung on these occasions, including "Green Brooms", "Here's a health to the barley mow", and "Harvest Home".

A number of customs also were associated with the feast; a man would have been chosen to rush to the site of the feast with the corn neck and enter the building by stealth avoiding an appointed lady who would have soaked the carrier of the neck if discovered. If this game was successful then the carrier of the neck would have been entitled to take a kiss from female "guard" of the property.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Reed - The Cornish Traditional Year 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest reference to Guldize was in 1602 by [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] in his ''Survey of Cornwall''.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Carew, 1602 ''Survey of Cornwall''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4200">'''Humanitarian [[visa (document)|visa]]s''' are granted by some countries to  fulfill their [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees#Responsibilities of parties to the Refugee Convention|international obligation to protecting refugees from persecution]].  The [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] is often used as the main criteria in assessing whether or not there is a legitimate claim for protection, as this defines a refugee as a person:
* who is outside their country of origin or legal residence
* who is unable, or unwilling to return to their country of legal residence because of a legitimate fear of persecution regarding their race, religion, nationality, group membership, or a political belief, as defined by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]
* who has not been convicted of a serious crime by a fair tribunal.

Persons primarily seeking better [[economic migrant|economic opportunities]] may reasonably quote war, famine or environmental disasters as their main motive for leaving their countries of legal residence, for which reason humanitarian visas may be difficult to obtain.

==Australia==
Humanitarian visas are listed as “Subclass 200”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findlaw.com.au/articles/4303/what-are-the-types-of-humanitarian-visas-available.aspx Findlaw Australia article:What are the Types of Humanitarian Visas Available in Australia?]&lt;/ref&gt; and have several distinct forms
* 201: In-country Special Humanitarian Program Visa 
* 202: Global Special Humanitarian Program Visa (“SHP”) 
* 203: Emergency Rescue Visa 
* 204: Woman at Risk Visa

==European Union==
Humanitarian visas are not yet issued by the European Union, but have been recommended by, [[Alexander Betts (academic)|Alexander Betts]], who is the director of the Refugee Studies Centre, University of Oxford. He is the author of a book Survival Migration: Failed Governance and the Crisis of Displacement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Survival Migration: Failed Governance and the Crisis of Displacement|author=Alexander Betts|publisher=Cornell University|isbn=978-0801477775|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betts cites these as an alternative to the current choice for families between 
* [[refugee camp]]s,  which are often makeshift and overcrowded, with minimal facilities for hygiene, [[health care]] or education
* dangerous journeys, often  arranged by [people smuggler]s at very high cost.
* [[urban poverty]] as undocumented entrants working illegally  
The European Union Migration and Home Affairs directorate is considering establishing a unified agency &lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/asylum/index_en.htm EU Policy:Common European Asylum System]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian Federation==
Humanitarian visas may be  issued to stateless persons or citizens from countries such as the USA who may be considered potentially hostile, and traveling to  for a variety of reasons including cultural or political exchanges, sports events, scientific or technical conferences and providing temporary specialist services such as humanitarian relief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ils-usa.com/main.php?id=humanitarian&amp;lang=en Russian Visa Center, USA advice page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== USA:Humanitarian parole==
Humanitarian visas are also known as humanitarian [[Parole (United States immigration)|parole]] in the USA which are documents granted for short-term urgent humanitarian relief, typically for up to one year. People  who would otherwise be unable to enter the U.S. may be granted humanitarian parole in exceptional personal circumstances, but these do not permit them to obtain permanent residency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traveltips.usatoday.com/humanitarian-visa-108465.html USA Today, What Is a Humanitarian Visa?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indie Game Challenge''' is an award competition run in conjunction between the [[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] (AIAS), [[GameStop]] and [[The Guildhall at SMU|The Guildhall at Southern Methodist University (SMU)]] to support [[independent video game development]]. Started in 2009, the competition highlights ten to twelve independent games, with winning games receiving monetary rewards in addition to the award. The Indie Game Challenge ceremonies are held during the annual [[D.I.C.E. Summit]], during which the finalists are able to demonstrate their games to the press.

==Concept==
The Indie Game Challenge awards were created by AIAS, Gamestop, and the Guildhall to promote innovation in gaming from independent development. Mike Hogan, senior vice-president of marketing for Gamestop, cited the need for "new, cutting edge game developers who continue to stretch the boundaries and imaginations of gamers" in the industry, and hoped that the awards would "stimulate a new generation of game developers".&lt;ref name="cinemablend"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Indie-Game-Challenge-Offers-300-000-In-Prizes-18660.html | title = Indie Game Challenge Offers $300,000 In Prizes | first = William | last= Usher | date = 2009-07-15 | accessdate = 2012-08-17 | publisher = Cinema Blend }}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was designed to offer both monetary and scholarship prizes, valued up to $300,000.&lt;ref name="cinemablend"/&gt;

The Challenge accepts games in playable, near-complete versions (including [[beta software]]), and for games that have been released, limits such entries to those that have earned less than $100,000 prior to the competition.

'''Indivisible''' is a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] movement in United States politics, initiated in 2016 as a [[Trump resistance|reaction to the election]] of [[Donald Trump]] as [[President of the United States]]. The movement began with the online publication of a handbook written by [[Congressional staff]]ers with suggestions for peacefully but effectively resisting the move to the right in the [[Federal_government_of_the_United_States#Executive_branch|executive branch of the United States government]] under the Trump administration that was widely anticipated and feared by progressives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4xmSPefMnI|title=Anti-Donald Trump Backlash Outpacing Tea Party|first=Rachel|last=Maddow|publisher=MSNBC|date=February 2, 2017|accessdate=July 18, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of Indivisible, according to [[Peter Dreier]], is to "save American democracy" and "resume the project of creating a humane America that is more like [[social democracy]] than [[corporate plutocracy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dreier|first1=Peter|title=The Anti-Trump Movement: Recover, Resist, Reform|url=http://prospect.org/article/anti-trump-movement-recover-resist-reform-0|publisher=''[[The American Prospect]]''|accessdate=July 28, 2017|date=April 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The movement started with the online publication of a 23-page handbook, ''Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indivisible.org/guide|title=Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda|website=Indivisible Guide|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the document, most notably Ezra Levin, Jeremy Haile, Leah Greenberg, and Angel Padilla,&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/05/13/anti-trump-indivisible-tea-party/|title=Meet the husband-wife duo who are sparking a liberal Tea Party movement|author=Caey Tolan|date=May 13, 2017|website=mercurynews.com|accessdate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; were former [[Congressional staff]]ers.  Greenberg worked as an aide to Democratic Representative [[Tom Perriello]] of [[Virginia]],&lt;ref name=politico&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/protest-movement-republicans-234863|title=Inside the protest movement that has Republicans reeling|publisher=politico|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Levin, Greenberg's husband, worked as an aide to [[Lloyd Doggett]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Texas]]. After the 2016 presidential election, in mid-December 2016, Levin and Greenberg began working on an online guide in the form of a [[Google Docs, Sheets and Slides|Google Document]] on how to make contact with congressional aides as a way of grieving over Trump's victory. Angel Padilla, and Jeremy Haile, and dozens of other staffers for Democratic members of the [[United States Congress]] joined in the creation of the online publication.&lt;ref name=politico/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JwOLRWaGX4|title=Online Guide Helps Focus Anti-Donald Trump Movement - Rachel Maddow - MSNBC|first=|last=MSNBC|date=January 5, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=July 18, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors modeled their document after the [[Tea Party movement]], which focused on local activism and obstructing the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s agenda following the election of President [[Barack Obama]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-crowd-sourced-guide-to-fighting-trumps-agenda|title=The Crowdsourced Guide to Fighting Trump's Agenda|last=Bethea|first=Charles|date=December 16, 2016|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They thought that similar action taken by the left could be effective against what they perceived as Trump's "bigoted and anti-democratic agenda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/opinion/to-stop-trump-democrats-can-learn-from-the-tea-party.html|title=To Stop Trump, Democrats Can Learn From the Tea Party|date=January 2, 2017|first1=Ezra|last1=Levin|last2=Greenberg|first2=Leah|last3=Padilla|first3=Angel|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the guide was to encourage resistance to [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump's presidency]], most notably by targeting Republican elected members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] by attending town halls, calling congressional officials, visiting their offices, and showing up at public events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/11/politics/indivisible-profile-trnd|title=What is Indivisible? Political group hopes to be flip side of tea party|last=Criss|first=Doug|date=February 11, 2017|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was first published online on [[Google Docs, Sheets and Slides|Google Docs]] on December 14, 2016, with Levin posting a link to it on his personal [[Twitter]] account. It soon went [[Viral phenomenon|viral]],&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; with, among others, [[Robert Reich]], [[Jonathan Chait]], [[George Takei]] and [[Miranda July]] circulating it online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/magazine/democratic-party-election-trump.html|title=The New Party of No|last=Homans|first=Charles|date=March 13, 2017|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Since the guide's publication, its authors have created a website with further resources on using the guide and organizing local movements. The guide is continuously updated and is available in English and Spanish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By February 4, 2017, less than two months from the publication of the Indivisible Guide, and about two weeks after Trump's [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]], more than 3,800 local groups identifying as "Indivisibles" had formed and declared their support for the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indivisible.org/act-locally|title=local action groups|author=|date=|website=indivisibleguide.com|accessdate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February, they organized as a [[501(c) organization#501(c)(4)|501(c) organization]].&lt;ref name="politico" /&gt;

Many groups attended [[town hall]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buffalonews.com/2017/02/18/huge-crowd-progressives-overwhelms-reed-town-hall-meeting/|title=Raucous crowds overwhelm Reed town hall meetings|first=Jerry|last=Zremski|date=February 18, 2017|website=buffalonews.com|accessdate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated against nominees for [[Cabinet of Donald Trump|Trump's Cabinet]], and worked with organizers of the [[2017 Women's March|Women's March]]. [[John Kasich]] and [[Mo Brooks]] acknowledged that the protests would impact [[efforts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kasich-obamacare-protesters_us_58b2dcb8e4b060480e08b507|title=John Kasich Admits Protesters Are Affecting Obamacare Debate|first=Matt|last=Fuller|date=February 26, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=April 17, 2017|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/24/politics/kfile-mo-brooks-obamacare-repeal/index.html|title=GOP Rep.

[[File:Keezhvenmani martyrs memorial building opening (4).JPG|thumb|Raised fist carried as part of the 2014 inauguration of the Keezhvenmani martyrs memorial]]
The '''Kilvenmani massacre''' (or '''Keezhvenmani massacre''') was an incident in [[Kizhavenmani]] village, 8&amp;nbsp;km from Kilvelur which is Taluk headquarters, Nagapattinam District, [[Tamil Nadu]] on 25 December 1968&lt;ref name="TheHindu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Farmers pay tribute to Kilvenmani victims|work=[[The Hindu Times|The Hindu]]|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-pay-tribute-to-kilvenmani-victims/article4951771.ece|date=25 July 2013|accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a group of 44 women and children, the families of striking [[Dalits]] village labourers, were murdered by a gang, allegedly led by their landlords.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=4363915 | title=Indian Peasant Uprisings |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=9 |issue=32/34 |year=1974 |pages=1391–1412 | author=[[Kathleen Gough]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Gopalakrishna Naidu]],a landlord from Irinjiur near to Keezhvenmani([[Kizhavenmani|Kilvenmeni]]) [[Nagapattinam]] (once part of [[Thanjavur]]) and he was the president of the [[Thanjavur|Tanjore]] [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] Area Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.milligazette.com/news/13400-no-one-killed-the-dalits|title=‘No One Killed the Dalits’|website=www.milligazette.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formed a Paddy Producers Association with [[Narayanasamy Naidu]], a former MLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesundayindian.com/en/story/red-rice-caste-and-class-war/7/30961/|title=Red Rice: caste and class war - N Sundharabuddhan - The Sunday Indian|website=www.thesundayindian.com|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Gopalakrishna naidu]] was the architect of Keezhvenmani Massacre and killed 44 farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=HfNRO-LtsN4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=gopalakrishna+naidu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD74bQ8_PdAhUHfCsKHchYDxAQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=gopalakrishna%20naidu&amp;f=false|title=Uproot Hindutva: The Fiery Voice of the Liberation Panthers|last=Thirumaavalavan|date=2004|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=9788185604794|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became a notable event in [[left wing]] political campaigns of the time and in [[Self-Respect Movement|Dravidianist ideology]]. The incident helped to initiate large-scale changes in the local rural economy, engendering a massive redistribution of land in the region.&lt;ref name="hin2009"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/anniversary-of-keezhvenmani-carnage-observed/article126200.ece | title=Anniversary of Keezhvenmani carnage observed | work=The Hindu | date=26 December 2009 | accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/anniversary-of-keezhvenmani-carnage-observed/article126200.ece | title=New memorial to commemorate Keezhvenmani massacre | work=The Hindu | date=10 March 2014 | accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Massacre==
The incident occurred when the landless peasants were influenced by the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] to organise themselves into a campaign for higher wages following the increase in agricultural production as the result of [[Green revolution in India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Administrator, Vol. 35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0WFAAAAMAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dnaindia.com/analysis/standpoint-continued-violence-against-dalits-raises-the-question-how-tolerant-are-hindus-1984690 | title=Continued violence against Dalits raises the question, how 'tolerant' are Hindus? | work=DNA India | date=3 May 2014 | accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The lands were controlled by powerful families, while the labourers were from a Dalit community. In 1968, the agricultural labourers of [[Tanjore District (Madras Presidency)|unified Tanjore district]] formed a union seeking better working conditions and higher wages.&lt;ref name="new" /&gt; To mark their union the workers hoisted red flags in their villages, irking their landlords. The landlords formed a separate union with yellow flags and started laying off workers belonging to the Communist unions.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

This led to tensions and finally a boycott by all labourers. The peasants withheld part of the harvest as a negotiating tactic.&lt;ref name = "gokul"/&gt; The Paddy Producers Association, representing the local landlords, organised external labourers to continue the harvest. Matters became fraught when a local shopkeeper who supported the protesters was kidnapped by supporters of the landlords and beaten up. Protesters attacked the kidnappers, forcing them to release their hostage. In the clash, one of the landlords' agents was killed.&lt;ref name="Armstrong2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elisabeth Armstrong|title=Gender and Neoliberalism: The All India Democratic Women’s Association and Globalization Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YQIKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|date=7 November 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-91142-5|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vens.jpg|thumb|44 people burnt alive]]
According to eye witness accounts, on 25 December 1968, at around 10 p.m., the landlords and their 200 henchmen came in Police lorries and surrounded the hutments, cutting off all routes of escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2017/dec/24/fire-of-1968-still-burning-inside-1735689.html|title=Fire of 1968 still burning inside|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers shot at the labourers, mortally wounding two of them. Labourers and their families could only throw stones to protect themselves or flee from the spot. Many of the women and children, and some old men, took refuge in a hut that was 8 ft x 9 ft. But the attackers surrounded it and set fire to it, burning them to death. The fire was systematically stoked with hay and dry wood. &lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josian Racine &amp; Jean Racine, [http://cssaame.com/issues/18_1/RACINES.pdf ''Dalit Identities and the Dialectic of Oppression and Emancipation in a Changing India: The Tamil Case and Beyond'']&lt;/ref&gt; Two children thrown out from the burning hut in the hope that they would survive were thrown back into the flames by the arsonists. Of six people who managed to come out of the burning hut, two of whom were caught, hacked to death and thrown back into the flame. Post this heinous crime, attackers went straight to the police station, demanded protection against reprisals and got it. The massacre resulted in death of 44, including 5 aged men, 16 women and 23 children.&lt;ref name="new" /&gt;

Reacting to the carnage, the then [[List of Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu|Chief Minister]] [[C. Annadurai]], sent two of his Cabinet Ministers – PWD Minister [[M Karunanidhi]] and Law Minister [[S. Madhavan]]- to the site of the incident. He also conveyed his condolences and promised action.

In the subsequent trial, the landlords were convicted of involvement in the event. Ten of them were sentenced to 10 years in jail. However, an appeal court overturned the conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thesundayindian.com/en/story/red-rice-caste-and-class-war/7/30961/ | title=Red Rice: caste and class war | work=The Sunday Indian | date=11 March 2012 | accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irinjur Gopalakrishnan Naidu]], leader of the Paddy Producers Association, was accused of being behind the massacre. the [[Madras High Court]] acquitted the landlord in 1975, quashing the [[Nagapattinam]] district court judgment awarding him 10 years of imprisonment in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2017/dec/24/fire-of-1968-still-burning-inside-1735689.html|title=Fire of 1968 still burning inside|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;but was murdered in a revenge attack in 1980.&lt;ref name="gokul"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/Communists-dalit-groups-pay-respects-to-Keezhvenmani-massacre-victims/articleshow/17762971.cms | title=Communists, dalit groups pay respects to Keezhvenmani massacre victims | work=Times Of India | date=26 December 2012 | accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/New-memorial-to-commemorate-Keezhvenmani-massacre/article11405049.ece|title=New memorial to commemorate Keezhvenmani massacre|last=Reporter|first=Staff|date=2014-03-10|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The massacre led to widespread demand for changes in land ownership and to attitudes regarding caste. Gandhian reformer [[Krishnammal Jagannathan]] and her husband led a series of non-violent demonstrations, arguing for the redistribution of land owned by the local Hindu temple and Trust lands in Valivalam to members of the Dalit caste. The couple also founded an organisation to promote their aims.  Krishnammal Jeganathan later said, on the eve of a commemoration of the massacre, "I could not sleep last night, and the sight of the violence feels fresh in my mind - fresh blood of a butchered child, and charred bodies of women and children, who had taken refuge in a hut".&lt;ref name="hin2009" /&gt;

Feminist activists played a significant role in making the massacre well known. Six years after the killings the first state conference of the [[All India Democratic Women's Association|Democratic Women's Association]] was held in Kizhavenmani.&lt;ref&gt;Omvedt, Gail, ''Reinventing Revolution: New Social Movements and the Socialist Tradition in India'', M.E. Sharpe, Armonk, 1993, p..78&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mythili Sivaraman]] helped to publicize the atrocities through her articles and essays. A collection of her writings about the incident was released as a book named ''Haunted by Fire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/lest-we-forget/article5282920.ece | title=Lest we forget... | work=The Hindu | date=29 October 2013 | accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|Periyar]],a month later speaks about the event,“wage is not something you can demand, a wage is that which is fixed by market conditions”,and he blamed the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|Communists]] for the massacre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.milligazette.com/news/13400-no-one-killed-the-dalits|title=‘No One Killed the Dalits’|website=www.milligazette.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://toanewdawn.blogspot.com/2015/11/no-one-killed-dalits-part-i-by-meena_21.html|title=No One Killed the Dalits (Part I) by Meena Kandasamy|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=GRIDBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=kilvenmani+periyar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd-I-vlvTdAhVaXisKHbsXADAQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Gypsy Goddess|last=Kandasamy|first=Meena|date=2014-06-30|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers India|isbn=9789351160281|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
[[File:Keezhvenmani martyrs memorial building opening (5).JPG|thumb|The opening of the new memorial]]
The [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] organises an annual "Venmani Martyrs Day" to commemorate the massacre. Foundation stone for memorial was laid by Jyoti Basu in 1969 when he was Deputy Chief Minister of West Bengal. The memorial was erected by the party in the form of a black granite monolith carved with the names of the forty-four victims, including fourteen victims from one family.  It is topped with the hammer and sickle of the CPI(M). A plantain bud "carved out of monolithic red granite mounted on a platform serves as a memory of the dead".&lt;ref name="hin2009" /&gt;
Other political groups have also participated in the commemorations.&lt;ref name="gokul" /&gt; The Dalit political party [[Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi]] have objected to Communist control of the event. Its district secretary S. Vivekanandam said, "We also want to pay tributes to the martyrs. But the CPM does not allow us to arrange for any programmes during the anniversary saying that only their party stood in support of the farmers of Keezhvenmani. They also said that they had got the place of massacre registered in their party's name. It is unacceptable that a single party claims ownership of the historical place".&lt;ref name="gokul" /&gt;

In 2006, the CPI(M) announced that it would begin the construction of a much larger memorial (referred to as "Mani Mandapam"). In 2014, the partially completed new memorial was inaugurated by the party. It comprises 44 granite pillars, representing each of the victims, surrounding a large building functioning as a museum and centre of commemoration.&lt;ref name="new" /&gt;

Her body was not identified until 2013. The case received national attention due to the young age of the victim and the manner of her death.

==Death==
Castillo's abusive father, Genaro Ramirez, had taken two of his three young children and disappeared &amp;ndash; her mother, Margarita Castillo, figured that he had taken Anjelica and her sister and returned to his native Mexico.&lt;ref name=sister&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lorena Mongelli |author2=Reuven Fenton  |author3=Bruce Golding|title=My sister, Baby Hope|url=https://nypost.com/2013/10/14/what-baby-hope-would-have-grown-up-to-look-like/|accessdate=10 September 2014|agency=New York Post|date=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=devastated&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fenton|first1=Reuvan|title=Baby Hope's mom 'devastated'|url=https://nypost.com/2013/10/14/baby-hopes-mom-devastated-after-torture-revealed/|accessdate=10 September 2014|agency=New York Post|date=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, he left Anjelica in New York, taking her to stay with the children's grown cousin, Balvina Juarez-Ramirez, who lived in a house in [[Astoria, Queens]].&lt;ref name=confesses/&gt;&lt;ref name=sister/&gt;

Years later, Balvina's brother/Anjelica's cousin, Conrado Juarez, admitted to torturing, raping and sodomizing the child before [[smother]]ing her. Juarez, who was 30 years old at the time of the murder, had bound Anjelica to a table in his sister's apartment and deprived her of water on multiple occasions. Juarez claimed he originally did not intend to kill her but then suffocated her with a pillow after she cried out during her rape.  Juarez immediately informed Juarez-Ramirez that their cousin was dead, and his sister insisted they dispose of the body.&lt;ref name=confesses/&gt; Anjelica's body was placed in a [[cooler]], and the siblings took a car service to Manhattan to dump the cooler.&lt;ref name=reveals/&gt;&lt;ref name= network/&gt;

Anjelica's mother, believing her likely in Mexico with the father, and also unable to communicate in English, never reported her missing.&lt;ref name=confesses/&gt;&lt;ref name=mail/&gt;&lt;ref name=reveals&gt;{{cite news|title=Mom of "Baby Hope" Reveals Why She Didn't Call Police|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Mom-of-Baby-Hope-Interview-Explains-Didnt-Call-Police-Anjelica-227826221.html|accessdate=10 September 2014|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margarita did claim that she and her family had searched for her daughter but were unable to locate her, for which she became the subject of much criticism and anger when Anjelica was identified in 2013.&lt;ref name=sister/&gt; Other reports reveal that her family also neglected to report her missing, as some of the family members, including Margarita, were apparently [[undocumented immigrants]]. They feared that if it was discovered that some were in the country without documentation during the course of an investigation, they would be [[deportation|deported]].&lt;ref name=report2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dahl|first1=Julia|title="Baby Hope" Case: Why didn't anyone in Anjelica Castillo's family ever report her missing?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/baby-hope-case-why-didnt-anyone-in-anjelica-castillos-family-ever-report-her-missing/|accessdate=10 September 2014|agency=48 Crimesider|publisher=CBS|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
[[File:Baby Hope cooler.jpg|thumb|left|The cooler in which Castillo's body was found.]]

Anjelica's [[decomposition|decomposing]] body was discovered on July 23, 1991, inside a navy blue [[cooler]] along the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]] in Manhattan, New York. The body was so decomposed that identification was at first impossible, as her face was not recognizable&amp;mdash;she soon came to be known as "Baby Hope".&lt;ref name=report/&gt;&lt;ref name=killer/&gt; She was naked and had been bound with both [[rope]] and a [[Window blind|Venetian blind]] cord. She was placed in a [[fetal position]] with her hands pressed together.&lt;ref name=killer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daly|first1=Michael|title=Baby Hope Killer Confesses After 22 Years|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/13/baby-hope-killer-confesses-after-22-years.html|accessdate=10 September 2014|agency=The Daily Beast|date=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body was then wrapped in a [[Bin bag|garbage bag]] and placed inside the cooler, which was filled with unopened [[Soft drink|soda]] cans and water (which was presumably [[Ice cube|ice]] at one time). Examiners concluded that "Baby Hope" was possibly Hispanic, had dark, wavy hair in a [[ponytail]], was [[Malnutrition|malnourished]], weighing only {{convert|28|lb|kg|abbr=off}}, was a victim of sexual abuse, and had died on-or-about July 18.&lt;ref name=network/&gt;&lt;ref name=killer/&gt; She was initially estimated to have been between three and five years old.&lt;ref name=nypd&gt;{{cite news|title=NYPD REOPENING 20-YEAR-OLD COLD CASE OF BABY HOPE|url=http://7online.com/archive/9181896/|accessdate=11 September 2014|agency=Eyewitness News 7|publisher=ABC|date=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After examination was completed and the case remained unsolved, police provided the money in 1993 to have the victim [[burial|buried]] after a public [[funeral]] was held.&lt;ref name=confesses&gt;{{cite news|author1=Paddock, Barry |author2=Tracy, Robert |author3=Parascandola, Rocco |author4=Schapiro, Robert |title='Baby Hope' case: Cousin confesses to sexually assaulting, killing toddler Anjelica Castillo more than two decades ago|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/relative-arrested-baby-hope-case-article-1.1483690|accessdate=10 September 2014|agency=New York Daily News|date=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A casket was donated in which to bury the little girl, and her headstone was marked as "Baby Hope". One of the officers who was investigating the case gave a eulogy. Two hundred people attended.&lt;ref name=killer/&gt;

==Investigation==
After the remains were originally discovered, a witness told authorities that she had seen a [[Hispanic]] man and woman carrying a cooler in the location where the body was found, prior to the discovery, around the time the girl was estimated to have been murdered. A few months later, in the autumn of 1991, some [[child pornography|images of a nude child]] were located in New Jersey, which some believed might have been "Baby Hope", as the girl in the photographs matched the victim's description.&lt;ref name=network&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 50UFNY|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/50ufny.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
"Baby Hope's" body was exhumed in 2006 and 2011 to obtain DNA information.&lt;ref name=confesses/&gt; Authorities reopened the case in 2013 and requested information from the public. The tip that broke the case came from an anonymous woman who told authorities that she had overheard a conversation two years prior between a mother and another person regarding the disappearance of her daughter.&lt;ref name=mother&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiss|first1=Murray|title=Baby Hope's Mother Identified 22 Years After Notorious Murder Of 4-Year-Old Girl In NYC|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/08/baby-hope-mother-identified-murder-new-york_n_4063017.html|accessdate=10 September 2014|agency=Huffington Post|date=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This information led investigators to Margarita Castillo, and DNA comparisons confirmed that she was the mother of "Baby Hope"&amp;mdash;who could now be identified as Anjelica Castillo.&lt;ref name=nypd/&gt;

{{quotebox|width=25%|align=left|quote="She wasn't missing; her father took them [her children] away and maybe that was my mistake, let him take them away. I did not go to the police because I was afraid of not being heard. I was afraid, not knowing the language." -Margarita Castillo, mother of the victim}}

Once investigators had identified Anjelica and her family, further effort led them to the names of her paternal cousins &amp;ndash; 52-year-old Conrado Juarez and his already deceased sister, Balvina Juarez-Ramirez. Juarez was questioned by detectives after being located working as a dishwasher in a restaurant in Manhattan. The subsequent interrogation led to his arrest for the crime.&lt;ref name=confesses/&gt;&lt;ref name=killer/&gt; He was initially believed to have traveled back to his native Mexico before his arrest.&lt;ref name=mail/&gt; He was subsequently charged with [[felony murder]].&lt;ref name=confesses/&gt; Police stated that they also suspect that Anjelica may not have been Juarez's only victim.&lt;ref name=reveals/&gt;

When first interviewed by reporters, Margarita Castillo refused to show her face but spoke through a closed door. She gave her explanation of why Anjelica was not reported missing and also described her devastation when she learned of the fate of Anjelica, and her anger toward Juarez. She was subjected to criticism throughout the community for not reporting anything about Anjelica's disappearance.&lt;ref name=devastated/&gt;&lt;ref name=out&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sandoval, Edgar |author2=Marcius, Chelsia Rose |author3=Parascandola, Rocco |author4=Moore, Tina |title=Baby Hope's mom speaks out after arrest in daughter's murder: 'I'm devastated'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/slain-baby-hope-mom-speaks-devastated-article-1.1484798|accessdate=10 September 2014|agency=New York Daily News|date=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members and friends of Anjelica's family had never known she had even existed.&lt;ref name=devastated/&gt; Anjelica's sister, Laurencita Ramirez, spoke to reporters about the case. When she was 11 she learned about Anjelica's existence and abduction by their father years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sister of 'Baby Hope': I wish I had met her|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20131015/us-baby-hope/|accessdate=10 September 2014|agency=Huffington Post|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramirez stated that she did not become familiar with "Baby Hope" until the case was re-opened and publicized in 2013. When she saw the artist recreations in the media, she saw a resemblance between the victim and herself and wondered if the still unidentified "Baby Hope" might be the missing sister she had heard about.&lt;ref name=sister/&gt;

When Anjelica was first identified, her father, Genaro Ramirez, was believed to be involved in her death, until Juarez confessed.

[[Rock and roll]] emerged as a defined musical style in the [[United States]] in the early to mid-1950s. It derived most directly from the [[rhythm and blues]] music of the 1940s, which itself developed from earlier [[blues]], [[boogie woogie]], [[jazz]] and [[swing music]], and was also influenced by [[gospel music|gospel]], [[country music|country and western]], and traditional [[folk music]]. Rock and roll in turn provided the main basis for the music that, since the mid-1960s, has been generally known simply as [[rock music]].

The phrase "rocking and rolling" originally described the movement of a ship on the ocean, but it was used by the early 20th century, both to describe a spiritual fervor and as a sexual analogy. Various gospel, blues and swing recordings used the phrase before it became used more frequently – but still intermittently – in the late 1930s and 1940s, principally on recordings and in reviews of what became known as "rhythm and blues" music aimed at black audiences. In 1951, Cleveland-based disc jockey [[Alan Freed]] began playing this music style while popularizing the term "rock and roll" to describe it.&lt;ref name="Turning Points"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordowitz|first=Hank|title=Turning Points in Rock and Roll|year=2004|publisher=Citadel Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-8065-2631-7|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various recordings that date back to the 1940s have been named as the first rock and roll record.

==The term "rock and roll"==
The alliterative phrase "rocking and rolling" originally was used by [[wikt:mariner|mariner]]s at least as early as the 17th century to describe the combined "rocking" ([[wikt:fore|fore]] and [[wikt:aft|aft]]) and "rolling" (side to side) motion of a ship on the ocean.&lt;ref name="hoyhoy"&gt;[http://www.hoyhoy.com/dawn_of_rock.htm Morgan Wright's HoyHoy.com: The Dawn of Rock'n'Roll], 1998-2008&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include an 1821 reference, "...&amp;nbsp;prevent her from rocking and rolling&amp;nbsp;...",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IzECAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=%22rocking+and+rolling%22+ship&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jfRPTcCzDNGYhQfnuKGoDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBTiCAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rocking%20and%20rolling%22%20ship&amp;f=false Richard Franck, ''Northern Memoirs, calculated for the meridian of Scotland&amp;nbsp;...'', A. Constable and Co., 1821]&lt;/ref&gt; and an 1835 reference to a ship "...&amp;nbsp;rocking and rolling on both beam-ends".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U_UbAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22rocking+and+rolling%22+ship&amp;q=406#v=onepage&amp;q=rocking%20and%20rolling&amp;f=false The United Service Journal, 1835, p.406]&lt;/ref&gt; As the term referred to movement forwards, backwards and from side to side, it acquired sexual connotations from early on; the [[sea shanty]] "Johnny Bowker" (or "Boker"), probably from the early 19th century, contains the lines "Oh do, my Johnny Bowker/ Come rock and roll me over".&lt;ref name="tosches country" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsward.com/shanty/JohnnyBoker/colcord.html John Ward's "Shanties and Sea Songs": Johnny Boker]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[hymn]] "Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep", with words written in the 1830s by [[Emma Willard]] and tune by [[Joseph Philip Knight]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ingeb.org/songs/rockdint.html "Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep" at Ingeb.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/r/o/rockcrad.htm "Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep" at Cyberhymnal.org]&lt;/ref&gt; was recorded several times around the start of the 20th century by the Original Bison City Quartet before 1894,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/RockedInTheCradleOfTheDeepByTheOriginalBisonCityQuartet1892- "Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep" by the Original Bison City Quartet]&lt;/ref&gt; the Standard Quartette in 1895,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r-k9ysIaaEUC&amp;pg=PA624&amp;lpg=PA624&amp;dq=%22Rocked+in+the+Cradle+of+the+Deep%22+reed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T50kBV4biU&amp;sig=mA1oXnPDzn5kqikFCm3yp0q75MI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DUN8TrO2JaLH0QX-ibXrDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rocked%20in%20the%20Cradle%20of%20the%20Deep%22&amp;f=false Tim Brooks, ''Lost sounds: Blacks and the birth of the recording industry, 1890–1919'', University of Illinois Press, 2004, p.99]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John W. Myers]] at about the same time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?queryType=@attr+1=1020&amp;num=1&amp;start=1&amp;query=cylinder7917 "Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep" by John W. Myers]&lt;/ref&gt; and Gus Reed in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpevky41tkA "Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep" by Gus Reed]&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, the specific phrase "rocking and rolling" was also used by [[African American]]s in [[spirituals]] with a religious connotation.&lt;ref name="hoyhoy" /&gt;

A comic song titled "Rock and Roll Me" was performed by Johnny Gardner of the Moore's Troubadours theatrical group during a performance in Australia in 1886, and one newspaper critic wrote that Gardner "made himself so amusing that the large audience fairly rocked and rolled with laughter." &lt;ref&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/73767425?searchTerm=%22rock%20and%20roll%20me%22%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=sortby=dateAsc# Independent (Footscray, Victoria) 27 November 1886 p 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known recording of the phrase in use was on a 1904 [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] phonograph record "The [[Camp Meeting]] Jubilee" by the [[Haydn Quartet (vocal ensemble)|Haydn Quartet]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://victor.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/matrix/detail/200001758/B-987-Camp_meeting_jubilee Victor Records number 4003]. A video of this record being played is here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPbcKW7gok0].&lt;/ref&gt; with the words "We've been rockin' an' rolling in your arms/ Rockin' and rolling in your arms/ Rockin' and rolling in your arms/ In the arms of Moses." Another version was issued on the [[Little Wonder Records|Little Wonder]] record label in 1916. "Rocking" was also used to describe the spiritual [[rapture]] felt by worshippers at certain religious events, and to refer to the rhythm often found in the accompanying music.&lt;ref name="hoyhoy" /&gt;

At the same time, the terminology was used in secular contexts, for example to describe the motion of railroad trains. It has been suggested that it also was used by men building railroads, who would sing to keep the pace, swinging their hammers down to drill a hole into the rock, and the men who held the steel spikes would "rock" the spike back and forth to clear rock or "roll", twisting it to improve the "bite" of the drill.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Reynolds Nelson, ''Steel Drivin' Man'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; "Rocking" and "rolling" were also used, both separately and together, in a sexual context; writers for hundreds of years had used the phrases "They had a roll in the hay" or "I rolled her in the clover".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockabillyhall.com/BillHaley.html Bill Haley &amp; The Comets]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 20th century the words increasingly were used together in secular black slang with a [[double entendre|double meaning]], ostensibly referring to dancing and partying, but often with the subtextual meaning of sex.&lt;ref name="unterberger birth"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/birth-of-rock--roll-t523 |title=Richie Unterberger, ''Birth of Rock &amp; Roll'', Allmusic.com |access-date=February 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209194624/http://allmusic.com/explore/essay/birth-of-rock--roll-t523 |archive-date=December 9, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. DeCurtis, ''Present tense: rock &amp; roll and culture'' ([[Duke University Press]], 1992), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, blues singer [[Trixie Smith]] recorded "My Man Rocks Me (with One Steady Roll)," first featuring the two words in a secular context.&lt;ref&gt;N. Tosches, ''Where Dead Voices Gather'' (Little Brown And Company, 2002), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was played with a [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]] and was one of the first "around the clock" lyrics, this slow minor-key [[blues]] was by no means "rock and roll" in the later sense.&lt;ref name="Trixie Smith"&gt;[http://www.redhotjazz.com/trixiesmith.html Trixie Smith]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the terms "rocking", and "rocking and rolling", were increasingly used through the 1920s and 1930s, especially but not exclusively by black secular musicians, to refer to either dancing or sex, or both. In 1927, blues singer [[Blind Blake]] used the couplet "Now we gonna do the old country rock / First thing we do, swing your partners" in "West Coast Blues", which in turn formed the basis of "Old Country Rock" by [[William Moore (musician)|William Moore]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Wyman]] and Richard Havers, ''Bill Wyman's Blues Odyssey'', Dorling Kindersley, 2001, {{ISBN|0-7513-3442-1}}, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1927, traditional country musician [[Uncle Dave Macon]], with his group the Fruit Jar Drinkers, recorded "Sail Away Ladies" with a refrain of "Don't she rock, daddy-o", and "Rock About My Saro Jane".&lt;ref name=macon&gt;[http://countrydiscography.blogspot.com/search/label/Macon%20Uncle%20Dave Uncle Dave Macon discography]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duke Ellington]] recorded "Rockin' in Rhythm" in 1928, and Robinson's Knights of Rest recorded "Rocking and Rolling" in 1930.&lt;ref name="hoyhoy" /&gt;

In 1932, the phrase "rock and roll" was heard in the [[Hal Roach]] film ''Asleep in the Feet''.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} In 1934, [[the Boswell Sisters]] had a pop hit with "Rock and Roll" from the film ''Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0025905/ Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round (1934)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Perkins and D. McGee, ''Go, Cat, Go!'' (Hyperion, 1996), p. 76, {{ISBN|0-7868-6073-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where the term was used to describe the motion of a ship at sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boswellmuseum.org/aboutsisters.html The Sisters]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, [[Red Allen|Henry "Red" Allen]] recorded "Get Rhythm in Your Feet and Music in Your Soul" which included the lyric "If Satan starts to hound you, commence to rock and roll / Get rhythm in your feet..." The lyrics were written by the prolific composer [[J. Russel Robinson]] with Bill Livingston. Allen's recording was a [[Race record|"race" record]] on the [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] label, but the tune was quickly covered by white musicians, notably [[Benny Goodman]] with singer [[Helen Ward (jazz singer)|Helen Ward]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Other notable recordings using the words, both released in 1938, were "[[Rock It for Me]]" by [[Chick Webb]], a swing number with [[Ella Fitzgerald]] on vocals featuring the lyrics "...&amp;nbsp;Won't you satisfy my soul, With the rock and roll?"; and "Rock Me" by [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], a gospel song originally written by [[Thomas A. Dorsey|Thomas Dorsey]] as "Hide Me in Thy Bosom". Tharpe performed the song in the style of a city blues, with secular lyrics, ecstatic vocals and [[electric guitar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1781 "Sister Rosetta" Tharpe (1915–1973) – Encyclopedia of Arkansas]&lt;/ref&gt; She changed Dorsey's "singing" to "swinging," and the way she rolled the "R" in "rock me" led to the phrase being taken as a [[double entendre]], with the interpretation as religious or sexual.&lt;ref&gt;Wald, Gayle, ''Shout, Sister, Shout!'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, [[Western swing]] musician [[Buddy Jones (Western swing musician)|Buddy Jones]] recorded "Rockin' Rollin' Mama", which drew on the term's original meaning – "Waves on the ocean, waves in the sea/ But that gal of mine rolls just right for me/ Rockin' rollin' mama, I love the way you rock and roll". In August 1939, [[Irene Castle]] devised a new dance called "The Castle Rock and Roll", described as "an easy swing step", which she performed at the Dancing Masters of America convention at the [[Hotel Astor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kg4hJLFOie4C&amp;pg=PA245&amp;lpg=PA245&amp;dq=Irene+Castle%27s+Rock+and+Roll&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wP7Rq6XxDo&amp;sig=P4GvVpLM5OdOJCipy7XB1kr0BEM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QJacToKeLsGUOprryIkJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Eve Golden, ''Vernon and Irene Castle's Ragtime Revolution'', University Press of Kentucky, 2007, p.245]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Marx Brothers]]' 1941 film ''[[The Big Store]]'' featured actress [[Virginia O'Brien]] singing a song starting out as a traditional lullaby which soon changes into a rocking boogie-woogie with lines like "Rock, rock, rock it, baby&amp;nbsp;..."'. Although the song was only a short comedy number, it contains references which, by then, would have been understood by a wide general audience.

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', an early use of the word "rock" in describing a style of music was in a review in ''[[Metronome (magazine)|Metronome]]'' magazine on July 21, 1938, which stated that "[[Harry James]]' "Lullaby in Rhythm" really rocks."&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/39786/why-do-exciting-things-rock English Language &amp; Usage: Why do exciting things "rock"?]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, a review of "Ciribiribin" and "Yodelin' Jive" by [[the Andrews Sisters]] with [[Bing Crosby]], in the journal ''The Musician'', stated that the songs "...&amp;nbsp;rock and roll with unleashed enthusiasm tempered to strict four-four time".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eTJEAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22rock+and+roll%22&amp;dq=%22rock+and+roll%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lZucTu7nCpDm-gb4kKX5CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBTgK The Musician, vols 44–45, 1939, p.219]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1940s, the term "rock and roll" also was being used in record reviews by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' journalist and columnist [[Maurie Orodenker]]. In the May 30, 1942 issue, for instance, he described Sister Rosetta Tharpe's vocals on a re-recording of "Rock Me" with [[Lucky Millinder]]'s band as "rock-and-roll spiritual singing",&lt;ref name=billboard300542&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MAwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT101&amp;dq=Billboard+may+30+1942&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EZ97TqDkEYqp8APzh8zFCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=orodenker&amp;f=false ''Billboard'', May 30, 1942], page 25&lt;/ref&gt; and on October 3, 1942, he described [[Count Basie]]'s "It's Sand, Man!" as "an instrumental screamer.. [which].. displays its rock and roll capacities when tackling the righteous rhythms."&lt;ref&gt;[http://antifolkexplicator.blogspot.com/2010_12_01_archive.html J. J. Hayes's Amazing Antifolk Explicator &amp; Philosophic Explicator]&lt;/ref&gt; In the April 25, 1945 edition, Orodenker described [[Erskine Hawkins]]' version of "[[Caldonia]]" as "right rhythmic rock and roll music", a phrase precisely repeated in his 1946 review of "Sugar Lump" by [[Joe Liggins]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oREEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT6&amp;dq=billboard+magazine+%22+april+1945%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lXU8TazRDsiAhAeug7y1Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Billboard'', April 25, 1945], page 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oREEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT6&amp;dq=billboard+magazine+%22+april+1945%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lXU8TazRDsiAhAeug7y1Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Billboard'', June 22, 1946], page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

A double, ironic, meaning came to popular awareness in 1947 in blues artist [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]]'s song "[[Good Rocking Tonight]]", covered in 1948 by [[Wynonie Harris]] in a wilder version, in which "rocking" was ostensibly about dancing but was in fact a thinly veiled allusion to sex. Such double-entendres were well established in blues music but were new to the radio airwaves. After the success of "Good Rocking Tonight", many other R&amp;B artists used similar titles through the late 1940s. At least two different songs with the title "Rock and Roll" were recorded in the late 1940s: by [[Paul Bascomb]] in 1947 and [[Wild Bill Moore]] in 1948.&lt;ref name=Aquila2000&gt;R. Aquila, ''That old-time rock &amp; roll: a chronicle of an era, 1954–1963'' (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2000), pp. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1948, [[Savoy Records]] advertised "Robbie-Dobey Boogie" by [[Brownie McGhee]] with the tagline "It jumps, it's made, it rocks, it rolls."&lt;ref name="tosches unsung"/&gt; Another record where the phrase was repeated throughout the song was "Rock and Roll Blues", recorded in 1949 by [[Erline Harris|Erline "Rock and Roll" Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;JammUpp – Issue no. 11, e-magazine, http://home.earthlink.net/~jaymar41/otherfems.html, retrieved 05/08/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

These songs were generally classed as "[[race music]]" or, from the late 1940s, "rhythm and blues", and were barely known by mainstream white audiences.{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 55, track 3; show 3, track 3}} However, in 1951, Cleveland disc jockey [[Alan Freed]] began broadcasting rhythm, blues, and country music for a multi-racial audience. Freed, familiar with the music of earlier decades, used the phrase rock and roll to describe the music he aired over station [[WKNR|WJW]] (850&amp;nbsp;[[AM broadcasting|AM]]); its use also is credited to Freed's sponsor, record store owner [[Leo Mintz]], who encouraged Freed to play the music on the radio.&lt;ref name="Turning Points"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=FA|title=Freed, Alan|year=2007|work=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]]|accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally Freed used the name "Moondog" for himself and any concerts or promotions he put on because he used as his regular theme music a piece called "Moondog Symphony" by the street musician [[Moondog|Louis "Moondog" Hardin]]. Hardin subsequently sued Freed on grounds that he was stealing his name, and because Freed was no longer allowed to use the term Moondog, he needed a new [[catchphrase]]. After a night of heavy drinking, he and his friends came up with the name ''The Rock and Roll Party'' because he already was using the phrase ''Rock and Roll Session'' to describe the music he was playing.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} As his show became extremely popular, the term became widely used to describe the style of music.

==Development of the musical style==
Rock and roll music emerged from the wide variety of musical genres that existed in the United States in the first half of the 20th century among different ethnic and social groups. Each genre developed over time through changing fashion and innovation, and each one exchanged ideas and stylistic elements with all the others. The greatest contribution came from the musical traditions of America's black population, with an ancient heritage of oral storytelling through music of African origin, usually with strong rhythmic elements, with frequent use of "[[blue notes]]" and often using a "[[call and response]]" vocal pattern. [[Music of Africa|African music]] was modified through the experience of slavery, and through contact with white musical styles such as the folk [[ballad]], and instruments, such as the Spanish guitar. New styles of music emerged among black Americans in the early 20th century in the form of [[blues]], [[ragtime]], [[jazz]], and [[gospel music]].&lt;ref name="unterberger birth"/&gt;&lt;ref name=palmer3-14&gt;[[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]], "Rock Begins", in ''Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'', New York : Rolling Stone Press/Random House, 1976-1980, pp. 3–14 (UK edition)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the writer [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Rock 'n' roll was an inevitable outgrowth of the social and musical interactions between blacks and whites in the South and Southwest. Its roots are a complex tangle. Bedrock black church music influenced blues, rural blues influenced white folk song and the black popular music of the Northern ghettos, blues and black pop influenced jazz, and so on. But the single most important process was the influence of black music on white."&lt;ref name=palmer /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the 1930s, [[African-American music|African American musicians]], such as [[Cab Calloway]], [[Fletcher Henderson]] and [[Duke Ellington]], were developing [[swing music]], essentially jazz played for dancing, and in some areas such as New York City processes of social integration were taking place. According to Palmer, by the mid-1930s, elements of rock and roll could be found in every type of American folk and blues music. Some jazz bands, such as [[Count Basie]]'s, increasingly played rhythmic music that was heavily based on blues riffs. In Chicago, blues performers formed into small groups, such as [[the Harlem Hamfats]], and explored the use of amplification. In the Midwest, jump bands developed instrumental blues based on riffs, with saxophone solos and shouted vocals. In Nashville and elsewhere, country music played by white musicians such as [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] incorporated blues styles, and in some cases was recorded with (uncredited) black musicians. In Texas and Oklahoma, [[Western swing]] bands, such as [[Bob Wills]], combined elements of big band, blues and country music into a new style of dance music. As musicians from different areas and cultures heard each other's music, so styles merged and innovations spread.&lt;ref name=palmer /&gt; Increasingly, processes of active cross-fertilisation took place between the music played and heard by white people and the music predominantly played and heard by black people. These processes of exchange and mixing were fueled by the spread of radio, [[78&amp;nbsp;rpm]] and later [[gramophone record|records]] and [[jukeboxes]], and the expansion of the commercial popular music business. The music also benefited from the development of new [[Amplifier|amplification]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction|electronic recording]] techniques from the 1930s onward, including the invention of the [[electric guitar]], first recorded as a virtuoso instrument by [[Charlie Christian]].&lt;ref name="unterberger birth"/&gt;
[[File:Louis Jordan, New York, N.Y., ca. July 1946 (William P. Gottlieb 04721).jpg|thumb|[[Louis Jordan]] in 1946]]
In 1938, promoter and record producer [[John H. Hammond]] staged the first "[[From Spirituals to Swing]]" concert in New York City to highlight black musical styles. It featured pianist [[Pete Johnson]] and singer [[Big Joe Turner]], whose recording of "[[Roll 'Em Pete]]" helped spark a craze across American society for "boogie woogie" music, mostly played by black musicians. In both musical and social terms, this helped pave the way for rock and roll music. Economic changes also made the earlier [[Big band|big bands]] unwieldy; [[Louis Jordan]] left [[Chick Webb]]'s orchestra the same year to form the Tympany Five. Mixing of genres continued through the shared experiences of the World War II, and afterward a new style of music emerged, featuring "honking" saxophone solos, increasing use of the electric guitar, and strongly accented boogie rhythms. This "[[jump blues]]" encompassed both novelty records, such as those by Jordan, and more heavily rhythmic recordings such as those by [[Lionel Hampton]]. 

Increasingly, the term "rocking" was used in the records themselves, and by the late 1940s frequently was used to describe the music of performers such as [[Wynonie Harris]] whose records reached the top of the newly christened "rhythm and blues" charts.&lt;ref name="unterberger birth"/&gt;&lt;ref name=palmer /&gt;

In 1947, blues singer [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]] recorded "[[Good Rocking Tonight]]", a song that parodied church music by appropriating its references, including the word "rocking" and the gospel call "Have you heard the news?", relating them to very worldly lyrics about dancing, drinking and sex. The song became much more successful the following year when recorded by Wynonie Harris, whose version changed the steady blues rhythm to an uptempo gospel beat, and it was re-recorded by Elvis Presley in 1954 as his second single. A craze began in the rhythm and blues market for songs about "rocking", including "We're Gonna Rock" by [[Wild Bill Moore]], the first commercially successful "honking" sax record, with the words "We're gonna rock, we're gonna roll" as a background chant. One of the most popular was "[[Rock the Joint]]", first recorded by [[Jimmy Preston]] in May 1949, and a R&amp;B top 10 hit that year. Preston's version is often considered a prototype of a rock-and-roll song, and it was covered in 1952 by [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets|Bill Haley and the Saddlemen]]. [[Marshall Lytle]], Haley's bass player, claimed that this was one of the songs that inspired [[Alan Freed]] to coin the phrase "rock and roll" to refer to the music he played.&lt;ref name="hoyhoy" /&gt;

Freed first started playing the music in 1951, and by 1953 the phrase "rock and roll" was becoming used much more widely to market the music beyond its initial black audience. The practitioners of the music were young black artists, appealing to the post-war community's need for excitement, dancing and increasing social freedoms, but the music also became very attractive to white teenagers. As well as "rocking" rhythm and blues songs, such as the massively successful and influential "[[Rocket 88]]" recorded by [[Ike Turner]] and his band but credited to singer [[Jackie Brenston]], the term was used to encompass other forms of black music. In particular, vocal harmony group recordings in the style that later became known as "doo-wop", such as "[[Gee (The Crows song)|Gee]]" by [[the Crows]] and "[[Earth Angel]]" by [[the Penguins]], became huge commercial successes, often for the new small independent record companies becoming established. These included [[Modern Records|Modern]], [[Imperial Records|Imperial]], [[Specialty Records|Specialty]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[King Records (USA)|King]] and [[Chess Records|Chess]].

The adoption of rock and roll by white people was hindered by racist attitudes. As [[Billy Burnette]] said about his father [[Dorsey Burnette]] and uncle [[Johnny Burnette]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;They'd buy their clothes on [[Beale Street]], at Lansky Brothers, where all the black people shopped. Right outside Memphis, there was a voodoo village, all black-real mystic kind of people... A lot of real old line southern people called my dad and my uncle white nigger. Nobody was doing rock-and-roll in those days except people they called white trash. When my dad and my uncle started doin' it, they were just about the first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rockin' in Time|last = Szatmary|first = David P.|publisher = Pearson|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-205-93624-3|location = New Jersey|pages = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although some of the rhythm and blues musicians who had been successful in earlier years – such as Joe Turner, [[Ruth Brown]], and [[Fats Domino]] who had his first R&amp;B hit in 1950 – made the transition into new markets, much of the initial breakthrough into the wider pop music market came from white musicians, such as Haley, Presley, [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], re-recording earlier rhythm and blues hits, often making use of technological improvements in recording and innovations such as [[double tracking]], developed by the large mainstream record companies, as well as the invention of the 45-rpm record and the rapid growth of its use in [[jukeboxes]]. At the same time, younger black musicians such as [[Little Richard]], [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Bo Diddley]] took advantage of the gradual breakdown of ethnic barriers in America to become equally popular and help launch the rock and roll era. By the time of Haley's first hits in 1953, and those of Berry, Little Richard and then Presley the next year, rock and roll was firmly established.&lt;ref name="hoyhoy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="unterberger birth"/&gt;
The Pentecostal church has also been identified as a crucial component in the development of rock and roll. The modern Pentecostal movement parallels rock and roll in many ways. Further, the unhinged, wild energy of the church is evidenced in the most important of early rock performers that were also raised in Pentecostal churches, including Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;Cosby, James A.

It contains the line "It takes a rocking chair to rock, a rubber ball to roll," which had previously been used in 1924 by [[Ma Rainey]] in "Jealous Hearted Blues",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueslyrics.com.ar/Ma-Rainey/JealousH.html Lyrics of "Jealous Hearted Blues"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425122215/http://www.blueslyrics.com.ar/Ma-Rainey/JealousH.html |date=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and which Bill Haley would later incorporate into his 1952 recording "Sundown Boogie."
* "It's Tight Like That" by [[Tampa Red]] with pianist Georgia Tom ([[Thomas A. Dorsey]]), recorded on October 24, 1928, was a highly successful early [[hokum]] record, which combined bawdy rural humor with sophisticated musical technique. With his Chicago Five, Tampa Red later went on to pioneer the Chicago small group "[[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]]" sound, and Dorsey became "the father of [[gospel music]]".
* "Pine Top's Boogie Woogie" by [[Pinetop Smith|Clarence "Pinetop" Smith]], recorded on December 29, 1928, was one of the first hit "[[Boogie-woogie (music)|boogie woogie]]" recordings, and the first to include classic rock and roll references to "the girl with the red dress on" being told to "not move a peg" until she could "shake that thing" and "mess around". Smith's tune derives from [[Jimmy Blythe]]'s 1925 recording "Jimmy's Blues",&lt;ref name="silvester" /&gt; and earlier records had been made in a similar style by [[Meade "Lux" Lewis]] and others.

* "[[Standing on the Corner (Blue Yodel No. 9)]]" by [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], recorded on July 16, 1930, was one of a series of recordings made by the biggest early star of country music in the late 1920s and early 1930s, based on blues songs he had heard on his travels. "Blue Yodel No. 9" was recorded with an uncredited [[Louis Armstrong]] (cornet) and [[Lil Armstrong]] (piano), foreshadowing later collaborations between black and white musicians but which at the time were almost unprecedented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/39/jimmie-rodgers-the-father-of-country-music Ted Ownby, ''Jimmie Rodgers: The Father of Country Music'', Mississippi History Now, July 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007161643/http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/39/jimmie-rodgers-the-father-of-country-music |date=October 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Tiger Rag]]" by [[the Washboard Rhythm Kings]] (later known as the Georgia Washboard Stompers), recorded in 1932, was a virtually out-of-control performance, with a rocking [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]] and unusually high energy.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p165639/biography|pure_url=yes}} Yanow, Scott, "Washboard Rhythm Kings: Biography"]&lt;/ref&gt; It opens with a repeated one-note guitar lick that would transform into a chord in the hands of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], [[T-Bone Walker]] and others. This is just one of many recordings by spasm bands, [[jug band]]s, and [[skiffle|skiffle group]]s that have the same wild, informal feel that early rock and roll had. After the original recording by the [[Original Dixieland Jass Band]] in 1917, "Tiger Rag" had become a [[jazz standard]] as well as widely covered in dance band and march orchestrations.
* "Good Lord (Run Old Jeremiah)" by Austin Coleman with Joe Washington Brown, from 1934, was a frenzied and raucous [[ring shout]] recorded by [[John Lomax|John]] and [[Alan Lomax]] in a church in [[Jennings, Louisiana]], with the singer declaiming "I'm going to rock, you gonna rock&amp;nbsp;... I sit there and rock, I sit there and rock, yeah yeah yeah."&lt;ref name=hoyhoy /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2010/02/good-lord-austin-coleman-and-joe-washington-brown.html WFMU's Beware of the Blog, 22 February 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Music historian [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] wrote that "the rhythmic singing, the hard-driving beat, the bluesy melody, and the improvised, stream-of-consciousness words... all anticipate key aspects of rock 'n roll as it would emerge some 20 years later."&lt;ref name=palmer /&gt;
* "Oh! Red" by [[the Harlem Hamfats]], recorded on April 18, 1936, was a hit record made by a small group of jazz and blues musicians assembled by [[J. Mayo Williams]] for the specific purpose of making commercially successful dance records. Viewed at the time (and subsequently by jazz fans) as a novelty group, the format became very influential, and the group's recordings included many with sex and drugs references.&lt;ref&gt;Sleevenotes to CD ''Let's Get Drunk and Truck'', Fabulous FABCD 253, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Dust My Broom|I Believe I'll Dust My Broom]]" (recorded on November 23, 1936), "[[Crossroad Blues]]" (recorded on November 27, 1936), and other recordings by [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], while not particularly successful at the time, directly influenced the development of [[Chicago blues]] and, when reissued in the 1960s, also strongly influenced later rock musicians.
* "[[Rock It for Me]]" was recorded by [[Ella Fitzgerald]] with [[Chick Webb]] and His Orchestra in 1937. Its lyrics mentioned a kind of music called "rock and roll": "Every night/You'll see all the nifties/Plenty tight/Swingin' down the fifties/Now they're all through with symphony/Ho ho ho, rock it for me!/Now it's true that once upon a time/The opera was the thing/But today the rage is rhythm and rhyme/So won't you satisfy my soul/With the rock and roll?"
* "[[One O'Clock Jump]]" by [[Count Basie]], arranged by [[Eddie Durham]] and recorded on July 7, 1937, was based on a 12-bar blues that builds in rhythmic intensity and features, like many of Basie's other records, the [[rhythm section]] of [[Jo Jones]] (drums), [[Walter Page]] (bass), and [[Freddie Green]] (rhythm guitar) that "all but invented the notion of swing through their innovations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=16602 David Rickert, ''Count Basie: "One O'Clock Jump"'', All About Jazz, 4 March 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Sing, Sing, Sing]]" by [[Benny Goodman]], also from 1937, written by [[Louis Prima]], featured repeated drum breaks by [[Gene Krupa]], whose musical nature and high showmanship presaged rock and roll drumming.
* "Rock Me" by [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], recorded on October 31, 1938, was important not only for its lyrical content, but for its style. Many later rock and roll stars, including [[Elvis Presley]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and [[Little Richard]], cited Tharpe's singing, [[electric guitar]] playing, and energetic performance style as an influence.&lt;ref&gt;Gayle Wald, ''Shout, Sister, Shout!'', p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; Tharpe performed the song with pianist [[Albert Ammons]] at the ''[[From Spirituals to Swing]]'' concert presented by [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] in [[Carnegie Hall]] on December 23, 1938. She also re-recorded the song with [[Lucky Millinder]]'s band in 1942, and columnist [[Maurie Orodenker]] described her vocals as "rock-and-roll spiritual singing".&lt;ref name=billboard300542/&gt;
* "[[Ida Red]]" by [[Bob Wills]] and the Texas Playboys, recorded in 1938 by a [[Western swing]] band, featuring electric guitar by [[Eldon Shamblin]].

* "[[Early in the Morning (Sonny Boy Williamson I song)|New Early in the Morning]]" and "Jivin' the Blues", both recorded on May 17, 1940 by [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|"Sonny Boy" Williamson]], the first of the two musicians who used that name, are examples of the very influential and popular rhythmic small group Chicago blues recordings on [[Lester Melrose]]'s Bluebird label, and among the first on which drums (by Fred Williams) were prominently recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afgen.com/williamson.html Biography: John Lee Williamson]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Down the Road a Piece]]" by the [[Will Bradley]] Orchestra, a smooth rocking boogie number, was recorded in August 1940 with drummer "Eight Beat Mack" [[Ray McKinley]] sharing the vocals with the song's writer [[Don Raye]]. The song would later become a rock and roll standard. The "eight beats" in McKinley's nickname and the popular phrase "eight to the bar" in many songs indicate the newness of the shift from the four beats per bar of jazz to [[boogie woogie]]'s eight beats per bar, which became, and remains, characteristic of rock and roll. Bradley also recorded the first version of Raye's "[[Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar]]", later recorded with greater commercial success by [[the Andrews Sisters]], whose biggest hit "[[Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy]]" also contains numerous proto-rock and roll elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigbands.org/andrewsbio.htm The Andrews Sisters Bio]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Flying Home]]" was recorded most famously in 1942 by [[Lionel Hampton]] and His Orchestra, with [[saxophone|tenor sax]] solo by [[Illinois Jacquet]], recreated and refined live by [[Arnett Cobb]]. This became a model for rock and roll solos ever since: emotional, honking, long, not just an instrumental break but the keystone of the song. The [[Benny Goodman]] Sextet had a popular hit in 1939 with a more subdued version of the song, featuring electric guitarist [[Charlie Christian]]. The book ''What Was the First Rock'n'Roll Record?'' by [[Jim Dawson]] and Steve Propes discusses 50 contenders as the "first rock and roll record", the earliest being "Blues, Part 2" from the 1944 ''[[Jazz at the Philharmonic]]'' live album, also featuring Jacquet's saxophone but with an even more "honking" solo.&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* "[[Mean Old World]]" by [[T-Bone Walker]], recorded in 1942, is an early classic by this hugely influential guitarist, often cited as the first song in which he fully found his sound. [[B.B. King]] credits Walker as inspiring him to take up the electric guitar,&lt;ref&gt;Helen Oakley Dance and B.B. King, ''Stormy Monday'', p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; but his influence extended far beyond the blues to jazz and rock and roll.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, Bill, [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p27828/biography|pure_url=yes}} T-Bone Walker: Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Among other innovations, "Mean Old World" has a two-string guitar lick where Walker bends notes on the G string up to the notes on the B string, which would be used by Chuck Berry in "[[Johnny B.

* "[[Caldonia]]", first recorded by [[Louis Jordan]] and then by [[Erskine Hawkins]] and others, seems to have been the first song to which the phrase "right rhythmic rock and roll music" was applied by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine in 1945. Jordan, by the time of his recording of the song, was an established star, whose novelty performances had been influenced in particular by [[Cab Calloway]]. Jordan's 1944 disc "[[G.I. Jive]]" had been the first record by a black performer to top both the [[Hot 100|pop]] and [[R&amp;B chart]]s. Big bands became increasingly less economically viable, and smaller groups such as Jordan's Tympany Five became more popular.&lt;ref name="unterberger birth"/&gt; Many of his recordings, including "[[Choo Choo Ch'Boogie]]" (recorded in January 1946) and "[[Let the Good Times Roll (Louis Jordan song)|Let the Good Times Roll]]", were hugely influential in style and content, and popular across both black and white audiences. Their producer [[Milt Gabler]] produced [[Bill Haley]]'s hits, and Jordan's guitarist [[Carl Hogan]], on such songs as "[[Ain't That Just Like a Woman (They'll Do It Every Time)|Ain't That Just Like a Woman]]" (also 1946), was also a direct influence on Chuck Berry's guitar style, and specifically Berry's solo in "[[Johnny B. Goode]]".&lt;ref name="tosches unsung"/&gt;
* "Rock Me Mamma" by [[Arthur "Big Boy" Crudup]], recorded on December 15, 1944, was the blues singer's first and biggest R&amp;B chart hit, but in later decades became overshadowed by his – at the time, much less successful – 1946 recording of "[[That's All Right]]", later to be covered by [[Elvis Presley]] in 1954 as his first single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinerootsofrock.com/blues/artists/crudup/ |title=Arthur 'Big Boy' Crudup |publisher=The Online Roots of Rock |date= |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Strange Things Happening Every Day]]" by [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], recorded in 1944 with pianist [[Sammy Price]], was a [[boogie-woogie]] flavored gospel song that "crossed over" to become a hit on the "race records" chart, the first gospel recording to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/sister-rosetta-tharpe-got-rock-rolling-long-before-elvis Dan DeLuca, ''Sister Rosetta Tharpe got rock rolling long before Elvis'', The Philadelphia Inquirer, 27 February 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; It featured Tharpe on an [[electric guitar]] and is considered an important precursor to rock and roll.&lt;ref name="F. Wald, 2008"/&gt;
* "[[The Honeydripper]]" by [[Joe Liggins]], recorded on April 20, 1945, synthesized boogie-woogie piano, jazz, and the riff from the folk chestnut "[[Shortnin' Bread]]", into an exciting dance performance that topped the R&amp;B "race" charts for 18 weeks (a record later shared with Jordan's "Choo Choo Ch'Boogie") and also made the pop charts. The lyrics proclaimed urban arrogance and were sexually suggestive – "He's a solid gold cat, the honeydripper... he's a killer, a Harlem diller...".&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* "[[Guitar Boogie (song)|Guitar Boogie]]" by [[Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith|Arthur Smith]], originally recorded in 1945 but not a hit until reissued in 1948, was the first boogie woogie played on the electric guitar, and was much imitated by later rock and roll guitarists. The tune was based on "Pinetop's Boogie Woogie" from 1929.&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* "[[The House of Blue Lights (song)|The House of Blue Lights]]" by [[Freddie Slack]] and [[Ella Mae Morse]] was recorded on February 12, 1946. The song was co-written by Slack with Don Raye, and, like Raye's "Down the Road a Piece", was recorded later by many rock and roll singers. Morse was one of the first white singers to perform what would now be regarded as rhythm and blues music.&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* "[[Route 66 (song)|Route 66]]", was recorded by the [[Nat Cole]] Trio on March 15, 1946. Written by [[Bobby Troup]], the song was a big hit for Cole – who by that time already had 11 top ten hits on the R&amp;B chart, starting with "That Ain't Right" in 1942 – and was later widely covered by rock and roll performers, including Chuck Berry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apileocole.alongthehall.com/sessions/session1946.html#session1 Nat "King" Cole Discography]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Boogie Woogie Baby," "Freight Train Boogie" and "Hillbilly Boogie" by [[the Delmore Brothers]], featuring harmonica player [[Wayne Raney]], were typically up-tempo recordings, heavily influenced by the blues, by this highly influential country music duo, who had first recorded in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=113# Delmore Brothers at Country Musc Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070723170059/http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/inductees.aspx?cid=113 |date=July 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rocky-52.net/chanteursd/delmore_brothers.htm Delmore Brothers discography]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Open the Door, Richard]]" was a novelty R&amp;B record based on a comedy routine performed by [[Dusty Fletcher]], [[Pigmeat Markham]] and others. It was first recorded in September 1946 by [[Jack McVea]], and immediately covered by many other artists, including Fletcher, [[Count Basie]], The Three Flames, and Louis Jordan, all of whom had hits with it. It was the precursor of many similar novelty R&amp;B-based records, which became a mainstay of early rock and roll in recordings by groups such as [[the Coasters]].&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* "[[Move It on Over (song)|Move It on Over]]" by [[Hank Williams]] was recorded on April 21, 1947. It was Williams' first hit on the country music charts, reaching no. 4. It used a similar melody to Jim Jackson's 1927 "Kansas City Blues" and was adapted several years later for "[[Rock Around the Clock]]".&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* "[[Good Rocking Tonight]]", in separate versions by [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]] (1947) and [[Wynonie Harris]] (1948), led to a craze for blues with "rocking" in the title. "Rock and Roll" by [[Wild Bill Moore]] was recorded in 1948 and released in 1949. This was a rocking boogie where Moore repeats throughout the song "We're going to rock and roll, we're going to roll and rock" and ends the song with the line "Look out mamma, going to do the rock and roll." Another version of this song (with songwriting credit to Moore) was recorded in 1949 by Doles Dickens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vocalgroupharmony.com/Findem.htm The Vocal Group Harmony Web Site: Doles Dickens]&lt;/ref&gt; Also related were "Rock and Roll Blues" by [[Erline Harris|Erline 'Rock and Roll' Harris]], a female singer, with the lyrics "I'll turn out the lights, we'll rock and roll all night" and "Hole in the Wall" by [[Albennie Jones]], co-written and produced by Milt Gabler, with the lyrics "We're gonna rock and roll at the hole in the wall tonight".&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoyhoy.com/artists/erline.htm Erline Harris]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Boogie Chillen']]" (or "Boogie Chillun") is a [[blues]] song written by [[John Lee Hooker]] and recorded in 1948. It was Hooker's debut record release and became a No. 1 [[Billboard R&amp;B chart]] hit in 1949. The guitar figure from "Boogie Chillen'" has been called "the riff that launched a million songs",&lt;ref name="Koda"&gt;

* "[[Rock Awhile]]" by [[Goree Carter]] was recorded in April 1949. It has been cited as a contender for the "first rock and roll record" title and a "much more appropriate candidate" than the more frequently cited "Rocket 88" (1951). Carter's [[Distortion (music)|over-driven]] [[electric guitar]] style was similar to that of [[Chuck Berry]] from 1955 onward.&lt;ref name="palmer19"&gt;[[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]], "Church of the Sonic Guitar", pp. 13–38 in Anthony DeCurtis, ''Present Tense'', [[Duke University Press]], 1992, p. 19. {{ISBN|0-8223-1265-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Rock the Joint]]", recorded by [[Jimmy Preston]] in May 1949, was a prototype rock and roll song which was successful in its own right and highly influential in that it was recorded three years later in 1952 by [[Bill Haley]] in the same hard rocking style. Although Haley first recorded in 1946, his early recordings, including "Rovin' Eyes", were essentially in the Western swing style of country music as was his 1951 cover of "Rocket 88" (see below). "Rock the Joint" became the first of his records in the style that became known as [[rockabilly]].&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* "[[The Fat Man (song)|The Fat Man]]" by [[Fats Domino]], recorded in New Orleans on December 10, 1949, featured Domino on [[wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]] mouth trumpet as well as piano and vocals. The insistent [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]] of the rhythm section dominates. The song is based on "Junker's Blues", by pianist [[Willie Hall (pianist)|Willie Hall]]. It was the first of Domino's 35 US top 40 hits and helped establish his career; he also played piano on [[Lloyd Price]]'s big 1952 hit "[[Lawdy, Miss Clawdy]]".&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;

===Early 1950s===
* "Boogie in the Park" by [[Joe Hill Louis]], recorded in July 1950 and released in August 1950, featured Louis as a [[one-man band]] performing "one of the loudest, most overdriven, and [[distortion (music)|distorted]] guitar stomps ever recorded" while playing on a rudimentary [[drum kit]] at the same time. It was the only record released on [[Sam Phillips]]' early Phillips label before founding Sun Records.&lt;ref name="decurtis_phillips"&gt;{{cite book|last=DeCurtis|first=Anthony|title=Present Tense: Rock &amp; Roll and Culture|year=1992|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|location=Durham, N.C.|isbn=0-8223-1265-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bsT3RQ9e58kC|edition=4. print.|quote=His first venture, the Phillips label, issued only one known release, and it was one of the loudest, most overdriven, and distorted guitar stomps ever recorded, "Boogie in the Park" by Memphis one-man-band Joe Hill Louis, who cranked his guitar while sitting and banging at a rudimentary drum kit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis' [[electric guitar]] work is also considered a distant ancestor of [[heavy metal music]].&lt;ref name="rolling_memphis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Jim|title=The Rolling Stone illustrated history of rock &amp; roll|year=1980|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|location=New York|isbn=0-394-51322-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZEUAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=July 5, 2012|quote=Black country bluesmen made raw, heavily amplified boogie records of their own, especially in Memphis, where guitarists like Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson (with the early Howlin' Wolf band) and Pat Hare (with Little Junior Parker) played driving rhythms and scorching, distorted solos that might be counted the distant ancestors of heavy metal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Hot Rod Race]]" recorded by [[Arkie Shibley]] and His Mountain Dew Boys in late 1950, another early example of "rockabilly", highlighted the role of fast cars in teen culture.&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* "[[Sixty Minute Man]]" by [[Billy Ward and the Dominoes|the Dominoes]], recorded on December 30, 1950, was the first (and most sexually explicit) big [[R&amp;B]] hit to cross over to the pop charts. The group featured the gospel-style lead vocals of [[Clyde McPhatter]] (though not on this song), and appeared at many of [[Alan Freed]]'s early shows. McPhatter later became lead singer of [[the Drifters]], and then a solo star.&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* "[[Rocket 88]]" was recorded on March 5, 1951 by [[Jackie Brenston]] and His Delta Cats – actually [[Ike Turner]] and the [[Kings of Rhythm]] – and covered later in the year by Bill Haley and the Saddlemen. Brenston's version – produced in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] by [[Sam Phillips]] and leased to [[Chess Records]] – was highly influential for its sound and lyrical content, and was a big hit. It reached no. 1 on the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|Billboard Rhythm and Blues chart]] on June 9, 1951, and set Phillips on the road to success by helping to finance his company [[Sun Records]]. Haley's version was one of the first white covers of an R&amp;B hit.&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt; The song also features an early example of [[distortion (music)|distortion]], or [[fuzz (electric guitar)|fuzz guitar]], played by the band's guitarist Willie Kizart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Shepard  | first = John  | title = Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World  | publisher = Continuum International  | series = Performance and Production  | volume = Vol. II  | year = 2003  | page = 286  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pJvzEzjahkQC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=rocket+88+distortion&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QpnFTYnQBIfGsAO9uvyaAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=rocket%2088%20distortion&amp;f=false  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "[[Cry (Churchill Kohlman song)|Cry]]" by [[Johnnie Ray]] was recorded on October 16, 1951. Ray's emotional delivery – he was mistaken for a woman, as well as for a black man – set a template for later vocal styles, and more importantly, showed that music could cross racial barriers both ways by topping the R&amp;B chart as well as the pop chart.&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* "Rock and Roll Blues" by [[Anita O'Day]] recorded on January 22, 1952. One of Anita O'Day's few compositions, she was one of the best jazz singers ever, and recorded this blues single on Mercury Records with her own orchestra.
* "[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]" by [[Big Mama Thornton|Willie Mae "Big Mama" Thornton]] was recorded on August 13, 1952. A raucous R&amp;B song recorded with [[Johnny Otis]]' band (uncredited for contractual reasons), it was written by white teenagers [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]], covered three years later by [[Freddie Bell and the Bellboys]] (Teen Records 101), and then more famously by Elvis Presley.&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* "Love My Baby" and "[[Mystery Train]]" were recorded by [[Junior Parker]] with his [[electric blues]] band, the Blue Flames in 1953, "contributing a pair of future rockabilly standards" that later would be covered by [[Hayden Thompson]] and Elvis Presley, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p112422|pure_url=no|label=Junior Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Presley's version of "Mystery Train", [[Scotty Moore]] also borrowed the guitar riff from Parker's "Love My Baby",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/encyclopaedia/p/P20.HTM PARKER, Little Junior : MusicWeb Encyclopaedia of Popular Music] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614015637/http://www.musicweb-international.com/encyclopaedia/p/P20.HTM |date=June 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; played by [[Pat Hare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillett|first=Charlie|title=The sound of the city: the rise of rock and roll|year=1984|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York|isbn=0-394-72638-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lkwUAQAAIAAJ|edition=Rev.|accessdate=July 6, 2012|quote="Love My Baby" in particular featured some blistering guitar playing by Pat Hare, which inspired the rockabilly style discussed elsewhere.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Gee (The Crows song)|Gee]]" by [[the Crows]] was recorded on February 10, 1953. This was a big hit in 1954, and is credited by rock n' roll authority, Jay Warner, as being "the first rock n' roll hit by a rock and roll group".&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Jay, American Singing Groups: A History from 1940 to Today (2006), published by Hal Leonard Corporation, p.137&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]" by Bill Haley and his Comets, recorded in April 1953, was the first of his recordings to make the ''Billboard'' pop chart. This was not a cover, but an original composition, and has been described as "the first white rock hit".
* "[[Mess Around]]" by [[Ray Charles]] was recorded in May 1953, one of his earliest hits. The writing credit was claimed by [[Ahmet Ertegün]], with some lyrics riffing off of the 1929 classic "Pinetop's Boogie Woogie". "[[I've Got a Woman]]", recorded in November 1954 and first performed when Charles was on tour with [[T-Bone Walker]], was a bigger hit, widely considered to be the first [[soul music|soul]] song, combining gospel with R&amp;B;&lt;ref&gt;Lydon, Michael, ''Ray Charles: Man and Music'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/ray-charles Ray Charles] (inducted 1986), Rock and Roll Hall of Fame &amp; Museum&lt;/ref&gt; its tune was derived from the gospel song "My Jesus Is All the World to Me" by [[Alex Bradford]].&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* "[[The Things That I Used to Do]]" by [[Guitar Slim]] was recorded on October 16, 1953. It was an electric blues song that had a major impact on rock and roll and featured distorted [[overtone]]s on the electric guitar a full decade before [[Jimi Hendrix]].&lt;ref name="aswell_slim"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aswell|first=Tom|title=Louisiana Rocks!

* "[[Work with Me, Annie]]" by [[Hank Ballard]] and the Midnighters, was recorded on January 14, 1954. Despite, or because of, its salacious lyrics, it was immediately successful in the R&amp;B market, topping the R&amp;B chart for seven weeks, and led to several sequels, including Ballard's "Annie Had a Baby" and [[Etta James]]' first hit "[[The Wallflower (Dance with Me, Henry)|The Wallflower]]", also known as "Roll with Me, Henry". Although the records were banned from radio play and led to calls for rock and roll to be banned, the lyrics were soon rewritten for a more conservative white audience, and [[Georgia Gibbs]] topped the pop charts in 1955 with her version "Dance with Me, Henry".&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* "[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]" by [[Big Joe Turner]] was recorded on February 15, 1954, and was covered early in July by Bill Haley and his Comets, whilst Turner's version topped the ''Billboard'' R&amp;B chart in June. Haley's version, which substantially was different in lyric and arrangement,{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 4, track 5}} reached no. 7 in the pop chart at the end of August and predated his much wider success with "Rock Around the Clock" by almost a year. Elvis Presley's later 1956 version combined Haley's arrangement with Turner's lyrics, but was not a substantial hit.&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" by Bill Haley and His Comets (recorded on April 12, 1954) was the first no. 1 rock and roll record on the US pop charts. It stayed in the Top 100 for a then-record 38 weeks. The record is often credited with propelling rock into the mainstream, at least the teen mainstream. At first it had lackluster sales but, following the success of two other Haley recordings, "Shake Rattle and Roll" and "Dim, Dim the Lights", was later included in the movie ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]'' about a raucous high-school, which exposed it to a wider audience and took it to worldwide success in 1955.{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 55, track 2; show 5, track 2}} The song itself had first been recorded in late 1953 by [[Sonny Dae &amp; His Knights]], a novelty group whose recording had become a modest local hit at the time Haley recorded his version.&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt;
* [[James Cotton]]'s "[[:File:James Cotton - Cotton Crop Blues.ogg|Cotton Crop Blues]]" and [[Pat Hare]]'s "I'm Gonna Murder My Baby" (both recorded in May 1954), were electric blues records which feature heavily distorted, [[power chord]]-driven electric guitar solos by Pat Hare that anticipate elements of [[heavy metal music]].&lt;ref name="palmer"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Anthony DeCurtis|DeCurtis, Anthony]]; [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Palmer, Robert]] et al.|chapter=Church of the Sonic Guitar|pages=13–38|title=Present Tense|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|year=1992|isbn=0-8223-1265-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O43vdMqqtCMC&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other side of Cotton's "Cotton Crop Blues" single "Hold Me in Your Arms" also featured a heavily distorted guitar sound by Hare that resembles the "distorted tones favored by modern rock players."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p84274/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Pat Hare |author=Koda, Cub |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[That's All Right]]" by Elvis Presley was recorded on July 5, 1954. This cover of [[Arthur Crudup]]'s tune was Presley's first single. Its [[B-side]] was a rocking version of [[Bill Monroe]]'s [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] song "Blue Moon of Kentucky", recognized by various rock singers as an influence on the music.

The music historian [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] wrote that [[Goree Carter]]'s earlier 1949 song "[[Rock Awhile]]" is a "much more appropriate candidate" than "the more frequently cited" "Rocket 88", primarily because of the presence of loud electric guitar work on the former song.&lt;ref name="palmer19"/&gt; Palmer wrote that "Rocket 88" is credited for its raucous saxophone, boogie-woogie beat, fuzzy amplified guitar, and lyrics that celebrate the automobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Palmer, Robert|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubWAht7N7zsC&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll:The Definitive History of the Most Important Artists and Their Music|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=1992|accessdate=August 13, 2013|isbn=0-679-73728-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he regards "Rock Awhile" to be a more appropriate candidate for the "first rock and roll record" title, because it was recorded two years earlier, and because of Carter's guitar work bearing a striking resemblance to Chuck Berry's later guitar work, while making use of an over-driven amplifier, along with the backing of boogie-based rhythms, and the appropriate title and lyrical subject matter.&lt;ref name="palmer19"/&gt; Roger Wood and [[John Lomax#Legacy|John Nova Lomax]] also have cited "Rock Awhile" as the first rock &amp; roll record.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Wood (2003), ''Down in Houston: Bayou City Blues'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=gdY5aJMVKkcC&amp;pg=PA46 pages 46-47], [[University of Texas Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lomax#Legacy|John Nova Lomax]] (December 2014), [http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/who-invented-rock-and-roll Roll Over, Ike Turner], ''[[Texas Monthly]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Others have taken the view that the first was [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]]'s "[[Good Rocking Tonight]]", or [[Wynonie Harris]]' 1948 version; the song received greater exposure when Elvis Presley covered it in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Jay|page=255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eyfeVZ6jf1oC&amp;pg=PA255|title=On this Day in Black Music History|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|year=2006|isbn=0-634-09926-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]]'s 1944 song "[[Strange Things Happening Every Day]]" has also been viewed as among the first.&lt;ref name="F.

Most rock historians have cited [[Bill Haley]]'s 1953 song "[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]" as the first rock and roll record to reach the ''Billboard'' charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crouse|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Crouse|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9rHJuNaJ-cC&amp;pg=PA18|title=Big Bang, Baby: Rock Trivia|publisher=[[Dundurn Press|Dundurn]]|year=2000|isbn=1-4597-1890-9|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haley's "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" released in 1954 was the first rock and roll record to achieve significant commercial success and was joined in 1955 by a number of other records that pioneered the genre.&lt;ref name="Ruhlmann"/&gt; Along with "Rock Around the Clock", several rock critics also have pointed to Presley's "[[That's All Right]]" from 1954 as a candidate for the first rock and roll record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLgqFaYmgw8C&amp;pg=PA189|accessdate=August 11, 2013|page=189|title=Icons of R &amp; B and Soul|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2007|isbn=0-313-34044-7|last=Gulla|first=Bob|authorlink=Bob Gulla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1992 book ''What Was the First Rock'n'Roll Record?'' by [[Jim Dawson]] and Steve Propes&lt;ref name="dawson propes" /&gt; discusses 50 contenders, from [[Illinois Jacquet]]'s "Blues, Part 2" (1944) to Elvis Presley's "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]" (1956), without reaching a definitive conclusion. In their introduction, the authors claim that since the modern definition of rock 'n' roll was set by [[disc jockey]] [[Alan Freed]]'s use of the term in his groundbreaking ''The Rock and Roll Show'' on New York's [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] in late 1954, as well as at his ''Rock and Roll Jubilee Balls'' at St. Nicholas Arena in January 1955, they chose to judge their candidates according to the music Freed spotlighted: R&amp;B combos, black vocal groups, honking saxophonists, blues belters, and several white artists playing in the authentic R&amp;B style ([[Bill Haley]], [[Elvis Presley]]). The artists who appeared at Freed's earliest shows included orchestra leader [[Buddy Johnson]], the [[Clovers]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Big Joe Turner]], the [[Moonglows]], [[Clyde McPhatter]] and [[the Drifters]], and [[the Harptones]]. That, say Dawson and Propes, was the first music being called rock and roll during that short time when the term caught on all over America. Because the honking tenor saxophone was the driving force at those shows and on many of the records Freed was playing, the authors began their list with a 1944 squealing and squawking live performance by [[Illinois Jacquet]] with [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]] in Los Angeles in mid-1944. That record, "Blues, Part 2," was released as Stinson 6024 and is still in print as a CD on the Verve label. Several notable jazz greats accompanied Jacquet on "Blues", including Paul Leslie and Slim Nadine (the monikers employed by Les Paul and Nat "King" Cole, respectively, in order to appear at the JATP concert incognito).

In 2004, Elvis Presley's "[[That's All Right Mama]]" and Bill Haley's "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" both celebrated their 50th anniversaries. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' felt that Presley's song was the first rock and roll recording.&lt;ref&gt;Cave, Damien, Matt Diehl, Gavin Edwards, Jenny Eliscu, David Fricke, Lauren Gitlin, Matt Hendrickson, Kirk Miller, Austin Scaggs, and Rob Sheffield. 2004.

Browne, ''The guide to United States popular culture'' (Popular Press, 2001), p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' felt that while there were rock and roll records before Presley's, his recording was the moment when all the strands came together in "perfect embodiment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/may/02/popandrock |title=The 50 moments that shaped pop history |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |publisher=guardian.co.uk |accessdate=January 22, 2011 |location=London |first=Sean |last=O'Hagan | authorlink= Sean O'Hagan (journalist) | date=May 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presley is quoted as saying: "A lot of people seem to think I started this business, but rock and roll was here a long time before I came along."&lt;ref&gt;''Race, Rock and Elvis'', Michael T.

Others point out that performers like [[Arthur Crudup]] and [[Fats Domino]] were recording blues songs as early as 1946 that are indistinguishable from later rock and roll, and that these blues songs were based on themes, chord changes, and rhythms dating back decades before that.&lt;ref name="Farley"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2013}} [[Wynonie Harris]]' 1947 cover of [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]]'s "[[Good Rocking Tonight]]" is also a claimant for the title of first rock and roll record, as the popularity of this record led to many answer songs, mostly by black artists, with the same rocking beat, during the late 1940s and early 1950s.&lt;ref name=hoyhoy /&gt; [[Big Joe Turner]]'s 1939 recording "[[Roll 'Em Pete]]" is close to 1950s rock and roll.&lt;ref name=Campbell2008&gt;M. Campbell, ed., ''Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes on'' (Cengage Learning, 3rd edn., 2008), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]] also was recording shouting, stomping music in the 1930s and 1940s, such as "[[Strange Things Happening Every Day]]" (1944), that in some ways contained major elements of mid-1950s rock and roll.&lt;ref name="F. Wald, 2008"/&gt; Pushing the date back even earlier, blues researcher [[Gayle Dean Wardlow]] has stated that "Crazy About My Baby" by [[Blind Roosevelt Graves]] and his brother, recorded in 1929, "could be considered the first rock 'n' roll recording".&lt;ref name=wardlow/&gt;

By contrast, musician and writer [[Billy Vera]] argued that because rock and roll was "an evolutionary process", it would be foolish to name any single record as the first.&lt;ref&gt;Billy Vera, Foreword to ''What Was the First Rock'n'Roll Record?'', by [[Jim Dawson]] and Steve Propes, [[Faber &amp; Faber]] 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Nick Tosches]] similarly felt that, "It is impossible to discern the first modern rock record, just as it is impossible to discern where blue becomes indigo in the spectrum."&lt;ref name="tosches country"&gt;Nick Tosches, ''Country: the twisted roots of rock 'n' roll'', New York : Da Capo Press, 1985. The quote with the blue and indigo comparison is on page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Music writer [[Rob Bowman (music writer)|Rob Bowman]] remarked that the long-debated question is useless and cannot be answered because "criteria vary depending upon who is making the selection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Rob Bowman (music writer)|Bowman, Rob]]|page=397|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ulLJUDmptFMC&amp;pg=PA397|title=The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Volume 1|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2013|accessdate=August 12, 2013|isbn=1-136-09570-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OrlandoCon''', also known as '''O'Con''', was a long-running [[comic book]] [[Comic convention|fan convention]] which was held annually between [[1974 in comics|1974]] and 1994 in [[Orlando]], [[Florida]]. The first comic book convention held in the Orlando area, OrlandoCon billed itself as a "Central Florida comic art convention and early TV/film festival." [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]-creator [[C. C. Beck]] was a regular guest of the show; as were many other [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] creators who lived in the Orlando area.

The founders of OrlandoCon were regional chairman of the [[National Cartoonists Society]] Jim Ivey, and local enthusiasts Charlie Roberts, Richard Kravitz, Rob Word, and Neil Austin.&lt;ref name=Scoop /&gt; Most OrlandoCons took place over a September weekend.

== Events and activities ==
Each year's show featured a banquet for attending cartoonists and the presentation to the guest of honor of a gold brick called the Ignatz Award&lt;ref&gt;[[R. C. Harvey|Harvey, R. C.]] ""Blood &amp; Thunder: Two for Cho, ''The Comics Journal'' #219 (Jan. 2000), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; named in honor of [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]''.

Each show featured a charity auction to benefit the [[Milt Gross]] Fund of the [[National Cartoonists Society]].&lt;ref name=Scoop&gt;Roberts, Charlie. [http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/Home/4/1/73/1017?articleID=112322 "Milton Caniff and Shel Dorf: A Personal View,"] ''Scoop''. Accessed Dec. 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The OrlandoCon often featured screenings of early TV shows, as well as panels, seminars, and workshops with comic book professionals. In addition, there was a floorspace for exhibitors, including comic book dealers and [[collectibles]] merchants. The show included an autograph area, as well as an Artists' Alley where comics artists signed autographs and sold or produced free sketches.

==History==
The first OrlandoCon was held in September 1974 at the Orlando [[Howard Johnson's]] Convention Center — guests include [[C. C. Beck]], [[Roy Crane]], [[Hal Foster]], [[Ron Goulart]], {{ill|Mel Graff|fr}}, [[Les Turner]], [[Ralph Dunagin]], [[Bill Crooks (comics)|Bill Crooks]], [[Harold McCauley]], "[[Scorchy Smith]]" artist [[Edmund Good]], and Disney artist [[Ralph Kent]].

In 1976 OrlandoCon moved venues from the Howard Johnson Convention Center to the International Inn, where the convention stayed for most of the rest of its existence.

Even though he moved to Pennsylvania in 1974, Charlie Roberts stayed with the OrlandoCon as co-organizer with Jim Ivey until 1979,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/Home/4/1/73/1013?articleID=136554 "Superstars: The Charlie Roberts Collection at Hake’s,"] ''Scoop''. Accessed Dec. 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; at which point small press publisher [[Bill Black (comics)|Bill Black]] became involved with the convention.

With the collapse of the [[Comic book collecting|comic book speculating market]] in 1993, the show petered out. The final OrlandoCon was produced by local retailer Mike Kott on September 10–11, 1994, at the Clarion Towers; guests include show founder Jim Ivey and [[Martin Nodell]].&lt;ref name="Sentinal94"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4930">The '''Pacific International Children's Choir Festival''' (PICCFEST) was established in 1998 as a week-long residential event and quickly became regarded as one of the top treble choir festivals in North America. The festival's co-founder and Artistic Director is Peter Robb, a composer and arranger of choral music as well as a conductor.  The other co-founders are Genevieve Robb and Rebecca Robb Hicks. The gathering takes place each year in [[Eugene, Oregon]], [[United States]], in conjunction with the long-established [[Oregon Bach Festival]].

In 2015 the name was changed to '''Pacific International Choral Festivals''' ('''picfest''') in order to better identify the expansion from one festival to two festivals each season. With the slogan Longer season, shorter name, '''picfest''' announced a line-up of four distinct events. On even numbered years, the June event is now Youth Choral Festival (open to all voicings of young choirs up through age 18) and the new July event is the Young Women's Choral Festival (for female singers through age 18). On odd numbered years, '''picfest''' features the Treble Choral Festival in June and the newly renamed Sing Brothers Sing! Choral Festival in July (for male singers up through age 18).

'''picfest''' is built on a non-competitive model. Each year ten -sixteen choirs are admitted through an audition process that takes into account the choir's history, repertoire, and recordings. Since inception, more than 180 choirs from 38 states and provinces in the United States, Canada, Australia, Finland, Taiwan and the Philippines have been selected and participated.

Choirs and their chaperones are housed on the beautiful [[University of Oregon]] campus.

The collaboration between '''picfest''' and the Oregon Bach Festival usually results in a performance by the '''picfest''' Chorus at the opening ceremonies of the Oregon Bach Festival. In 2008, with the U.S. Olympic Track &amp; Field Trials running concurrently with the festivals, the opening ceremonies performance took place on the performance venue at track's legendary [[Hayward Field]]. In 2011 and 2017, the Oregon Bach Festival had no official opening ceremony, and the entire '''picfest''' Chorus performed a free On-The-House concert.

'''picfest''' presents one of the Oregon Bach Festival's On-The-House concerts in the [[Hult Center]] lobby during each festival. This concert features one or two of the visiting choirs or the entire festival chorus, as in 2011 and 2017. Attending choirs also perform individually at various local churches on the Sunday of the June Festival. Each festival concludes with a ticketed concert -  the Gala Concert in June and the Finale Concert in July - performed by the Festival Chorus and guest musicians.

== Conductors  and themes==
Each year '''picfest''' features a guest conductor of international stature. Recent guest conductors have included Sandra Snow (2003, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2015), [[Bob Chilcott]] (2005, 2008, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018), Lynne Gackle (2010), Andrea Ramsey (2014, 2016) and [[Henry Leck]] (2001, 2006, 2013, 2017).

Beginning in 2014, the season expanded to two festivals each summer. On even numbered years: Youth Choral Festival and Young Women's Choral Festival;  and on odd numbered years: Treble Choral Festival and Boys &amp; Young Men's Choral Festival. Scheduled for 2019 are Susan Brumfield (Treble Choral Festival) and Fernando Malvar-Ruiz (Sing Brothers Sing! Choral Festival). The 2020 season features Bob Chilcott (Youth Choral Festival) and Andrea Ramsey/Sandra Snow (Young Women's Choral Festival). 

The repertoire of the festival chorus reflects a theme selected for each year, except for 2010 and 2012, which didn't have official themes:

1998 - Our Voices Raised in Song

1999 - Color the World with a Song

[[File:PhUSE Computational Science Symposium 2016 (26133831630).jpg|thumb|All members of a conference are expected to attend plenary sessions]]
A '''plenary session''' is a [[Session (parliamentary procedure)|session]] of a [[Convention (meeting)|conference]] which all members of all parties are to attend. Such a session may include a broad range of content, from [[keynote]]s to panel discussions, and is not necessarily related to a specific style of presentation or deliberative process.

The term has been used in the teaching profession to describe when information is summarized. This often encourages class participation.

The [[Congress of Vienna]] is an example of a [[congress]] that did not meet in plenary sessions.

==Early life and education==
Radovan Karadžić was born on 19&amp;nbsp;June 1945 in the village of [[Petnjica, Šavnik|Petnjica]] in the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]], [[Provisional Government of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]], near [[Šavnik]].{{sfn|Donia|2014|p=23}} Karadžić's father, Vuko (1912–1987),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:279208-Necu-da-pogazim-rec|title=Neću da pogazim reč|publisher=Novosti|date=6 August 2008|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.co.me/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1582:crnogorac-prodao-radovana&amp;Itemid=2062|title=Crnogorac prodao Radovana|publisher=Monitor|date=2 April 2010|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a cobbler from Petnjica. His mother, Jovanka ({{nee}} Jakić; 1922–2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/umrla-majka-radovana-karadzica/263909.aspx|title=Umrla majka Radovana Karadžića|publisher=Index|date=5 May 2015|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a peasant girl from [[Pljevlja]]. She married Karadžić's father in 1943, aged twenty.{{sfn|Donia|2014|p=23}} Karadžić claims to be related to the Serbian linguistic reformer [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] (1787–1864), although this claim cannot be confirmed.{{sfn|Donia|2014|p=24}}

His father had been a [[Chetnik]] — the army of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]'s [[government-in-exile]] during World War II—and was imprisoned by the post-war communist regime for much of his son's childhood.{{sfn|Donia|2014|p=25}} Karadžić moved to [[Sarajevo]] in 1960 to study psychiatry at the [[University of Sarajevo|Sarajevo University]] School of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J.

[[File:Radovan Karadžić 1971 publicity photo.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Publicity photo of Karadžić in 1971]]
Karadžić studied [[neurotic disorders]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] at [[Næstved]] Hospital in [[Denmark]] in 1970, and during 1974-1975 he underwent further medical training at [[Columbia University]] in New York.&lt;ref name=CNN23Jul08&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/07/22/karadzic.profile/index.html|title=Karadzic: Psychiatrist-turned 'Butcher of Bosnia'|accessdate=23 July 2008|date=22 July 2008|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moreorless.au.com/killers/karadzic.html|title=Info on graduate studies at Columbia U.|publisher=moreorless.au.com|accessdate=26 July 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726045044/http://www.moreorless.au.com/killers/karadzic.html|archivedate=26 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his return to Yugoslavia, he worked in the Koševo Hospital in Sarajevo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/karadzic/radovan/marketplace.html|title=Karadzic - The Marketplace Massacre And Radovan Karadzic {{!}} The World's Most Wanted Man|website=pbs.org|access-date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a poet, influenced by [[Serbia]]n writer [[Dobrica Ćosić]], who encouraged him to go into politics. During his spell as an ecologist, he declared that "Bolshevism is bad, but nationalism is even worse".&lt;ref name="Judah1997"/&gt;

==Financial misdeeds==
Soon after graduation, Karadžić started working in a treatment centre at the psychiatric clinic of the main Sarajevo hospital, Koševo.

==Political life==
Following encouragement from [[Dobrica Ćosić]], later the first president of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], and [[Jovan Rašković]], leader of the [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]], he cofounded the [[Serb Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Serb Democratic Party]] ({{lang|sr-Latn|Srpska Demokratska Stranka}}) in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1989. The party aimed at unifying the Republic's [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] community and joining Croatian Serbs in leading them in remaining as part of Yugoslavia in the event of secession by those two republics from the federation.

Throughout September 1991, the SDS began to establish various "Serb Autonomous Regions" throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the Bosnian parliament voted on sovereignty on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1991, a separate Serb Assembly was founded on 24&amp;nbsp;October 1991 in [[Banja Luka]], to exclusively represent the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The following month, Bosnian Serbs held a [[referendum]] which resulted in an overwhelming vote in favour of staying in a federal state with Serbia and Montenegro, as part of Yugoslavia. In December 1991, a top secret document, ''For the organisation and activity of organs of the Serbs people in Bosnia-Herzegovina in extraordinary circumstances'', was drawn up by the SDS leadership. This was a centralised programme for the takeover of each municipality in the country, through the creation of shadow governments and para-governmental structures through various "crisis headquarters", and by preparing loyalist Serbs for the takeover in co-ordination with the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gow|first=James|title=The Serbian Project and Its Adversaries: A Strategy of War Crimes|year=2003|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal|isbn=1850654999|pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9&amp;nbsp;January 1992, the Bosnian Serb Assembly proclaimed the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Република српског народа Босне и Херцеговине/Republika srpskog naroda Bosne i Hercegovine). On 28&amp;nbsp;February 1992, the constitution of the Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted. It declared that the state's territory included Serb autonomous regions, municipalities, and other Serbian ethnic entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as "all regions in which the Serbian people represent a minority due to the Second World War genocide" (although how this was established was never specified), and that it was to be a part of the federal Yugoslav state. On 29&amp;nbsp;February and 1&amp;nbsp;March 1992 a referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Yugoslavia was held. Many Serbs boycotted the referendum and pro-independence [[Bosniaks]] (Muslims) and [[Croats]] turned out.&lt;ref&gt;Nettelfield, Lara J. (2010).

On 6&amp;nbsp;and 7&amp;nbsp;April 1992, Bosnia was recognized as an independent state by the European Community &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/07/world/europe-nods-to-bosnia-not-macedonia.html|work=New York Times|title=Europe Nods to Bosnia, Not Macedonia|last1=Riding|first1=Alan|date=7 April 1992|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/countries/bosnia-herzegovina|title=A guide to the United States' history of recognition, diplomatic, and consular relations, by country, since 1776: Bosnia-Herzegovina|publisher=US Department of State, Office of the Historian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was admitted to the UN on 22&amp;nbsp;May 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml|title=Member States of the United Nations|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Karadžić was voted President of Republika Srpska, the Bosnian Serb administration, in [[Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Pale]] on about 13&amp;nbsp;May 1992 after the breakup of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. At the time he assumed this position, his ''[[de jure]]'' powers, as described in the constitution of the Bosnian Serb administration, included commanding the [[Army of Republika Srpska|army of the Bosnian Serb administration]] in times of war and peace, and having the authority to appoint, promote and discharge officers of the army. Karadžić made three trips to the UN in New York in February and March&amp;nbsp;1993 for negotiations on the future of Bosnia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diana/karadzic/3junea.htm|title=Doe v.

He went to Moscow in 1994 for meetings with Russian officials on the Bosnian situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/karadzic-arrest-hailed-as-step-towards-serbia-eu-membership/2008/07/22/1216492402328.html|title=Karadzic arrest hailed as step towards Serbia EU membership|accessdate=25 July 2008|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=22 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] declared Karadžić "one of the most prominent sons of our Lord Jesus Christ working for peace", and decorated him with the nine-hundred-year-old Knights' Order of the First Rank of Saint Dionysius of Xanthe.&lt;ref name=Velkonia&gt;{{cite book|first=Mitja|last=Velikonja|title=Religious separation and political intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2003|location=College Station|isbn=978-1-58544-226-3|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew]] announced that "the Serbian people have been chosen by God to protect the western frontiers of Orthodoxy".&lt;ref name=Velkonia/&gt;

On Friday 4&amp;nbsp;August 1995, with a massive Croatian military force [[Operation Storm|poised to attack]] the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina|Serb-held Krajina]] region in central Croatia, Karadžić announced he was removing General [[Ratko Mladić]] from his commandant post and assuming personal command of the VRS himself. Karadžić blamed Mladić for the loss of two key Serb-held towns in western Bosnia that had recently [[Operation Mistral 2|fallen to the Croats]], and he used the loss of the towns as the excuse to announce his surprise command structure changes. General Mladić was demoted to an "adviser". Mladić refused to go quietly, claiming the support of the Bosnian Serb military and the people. Karadžić countered by attempting to pull political rank as well as denouncing Mladić as a "madman", but Mladić's popular support forced Karadžić to rescind his order on 11&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/special/karadzic/timeline The Hague's Most Wanted – timeline of events]. SETimes.com (21&amp;nbsp;July 2008). Retrieved 13&amp;nbsp;November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War crimes charges===
Karadžić was accused by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) of personal and [[command responsibility]] for numerous war crimes committed against non-Serbs, in his roles as Supreme Commander of the Bosnian Serb armed forces and President of the National Security Council of the Republika Srpska. He was accused by the same authority of being responsible for the deaths of more than 7,500&amp;nbsp;[[Bosniaks]] (Muslims). Under his direction and command, Bosnian Serb forces initiated the [[Siege of Sarajevo]]. He was accused by the ICTY of ordering the [[Srebrenica genocide]] in 1995, directing Bosnian Serb forces to "create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival of life" in the UN [[safe area (Bosnian War)|safe area]]. He was also accused by the ICTY of ordering that United Nations personnel be taken hostage in May&amp;ndash;June&amp;nbsp;1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/tdec/en/121211_1.pdf Prosecutor v. Radovan Karadžić], Decision of 11&amp;nbsp;December 2012, [[ICTY]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was jointly indicted by the [[International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] in 1995, along with General [[Ratko Mladić]]. The indictment charged Karadžić on the basis of his individual criminal responsibility (Article 7(1) of the Statute) and superior criminal responsibility (Article&amp;nbsp;7(3) of the Statute) with:
* Five counts of [[crimes against humanity]] (Article&amp;nbsp;5 of the Statute – extermination, murder, persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds, persecutions, inhumane acts (forcible transfer));
* Three counts of violations of the [[laws or customs of war|laws of war]] (Article&amp;nbsp;3 of the Statute – murder, unlawfully inflicting terror upon civilians, taking hostages);
* One count of grave breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]] (Article&amp;nbsp;2 of the Statute – willful killing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/glance/karadzic.htm|title=UN Indictment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unlawful [[population transfer|transfer of civilians]] because of religious or national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7520682.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Karadzic will fight extradition|date=23 July 2008|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States government offered a $5&amp;nbsp;million reward for his and [[Ratko Mladić]]'s arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/english/index.cfm?page=Karadzic|title=Rewards for Justice|accessdate=13 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417040300/http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/english/index.cfm?page=Karadzic|archivedate=17 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fugitive==
Authorities missed arresting Karadžić in 1995 when he was an invitee of the United Nations. During his visit to the United Nations in 1993, he was handed a [[service of process]] for a civil claim under the United States of America Code of Laws [[Alien Tort Act]]. The Courts ruled that Karadžić was properly served and the trial was allowed to proceed in [[United States District Court]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kadić v. Karadžić'', 70&amp;nbsp;F.3d&amp;nbsp;232 (2d Cir. 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Karadžić's ability to evade capture for over a decade increased his esteem among some Bosnian Serbs, despite an alleged deal with [[Richard Holbrooke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7062288.stm|title=Hague probes Karadzic 'deal' claim |publisher= BBC |accessdate=24 July 2008|date=26 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources allege that he received protection from the United States as a consequence of the [[Dayton Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radovan Karadzic 'was under US protection until 2000'|work=The Telegraph|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/serbia/2496948/Karadzic-was-under-US-protection.html |author=Jon Swaine|date=4 August 2008|accessdate=13 July 2015|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holbrooke, however, repeatedly denied that such a deal was ever made.&lt;ref name="bbc-holbrooke"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7062288.stm |title=Hague probes Karadzic 'deal' claim|accessdate=13 July 2015|publisher=BBC|author=Nick Hawton|date=26 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as fugitive he was helped by several people, including [[Bosko Radonjich]] and in 2001, hundreds of supporters demonstrated in support of Karadžić in his home town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.esquire.com/features/radovan-karadzic-1297 |title=Radovan Karadzic: A Deeply Misunderstood Mass Murderer|accessdate=28 July 2008|publisher=Esquire}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2003, his mother Jovanka publicly urged him to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/01/comment.warcrimes|title=Whatever happened to ... Radovan Karadzic?|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=24 July 2008|date=1 July 2006|first=Iain|last=Hollingshead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British officials conceded [[military action]] was unlikely to be successful in bringing Karadžić and other suspects to trial, and that putting political pressure on [[Balkans|Balkan]] governments would be more likely to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiss.org/whats-new/iiss-in-the-press/july-2008/karadzic-snared-by-spy-tip-and-political-will/|title=Karadzic snared by spy tip and political will|publisher=The International Institute For Strategic Studies|accessdate=26 July 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813031615/http://www.iiss.org/whats-new/iiss-in-the-press/july-2008/karadzic-snared-by-spy-tip-and-political-will|archivedate=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May&amp;nbsp;2004, the UN learned that: "the brother of a war crimes suspect allegedly in the process of providing information on Radovan Karadzic and his network to the ICTY, was mistakenly killed in a raid by the Republika Srpska police" and added that "It is being argued that the informer was targeted in order to silence him before he was able to say more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/42f736424.pdf|title=Update on Conditions for Return to Bosnia and Herzegovina (2005)|accessdate=13 July 2015|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Bosnian Serb leaders called on Karadžić to surrender, stating that Bosnia and Serbia could not move ahead economically or politically while he remained at large. After a failed raid earlier in May, on 7&amp;nbsp;July 2005 [[NATO]] troops arrested Karadžić's son, Aleksandar, but released him after 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4659319.stm|title=Nato troops arrest Karadzic's son|publisher=BBC|date=7 July 2005|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28&amp;nbsp;July, Karadžić's wife, [[Ljiljana Zelen Karadžić|Ljiljana]], made a call for him to surrender after, what she called, "enormous pressure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4725923.stm|title=Karadzic's wife urges surrender|publisher=BBC|date=29 July 2005|accessdate=4 January 2010}} See also:{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2005/07/29/srpski/P05072807.shtml|title=Radovane, predaj se!|publisher=Yugoslavia News|date=29 July 2005|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC reported that Karadžić had been sighted in 2005 near [[Foča]]: "38&amp;nbsp;km (24&amp;nbsp;miles) down the road, on the edge of the Sutjeska national park, Radovan Karadžić has just got out of a red Mercedes" and asserted that "Western intelligence agencies knew roughly where they were, but that there was no political will in London or Washington to risk the lives of British, or U.S. agents, in a bid to seize" him and Mladić.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Bosnia's most wanted run free|publisher=BBC|date=28 June 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7477912.stm|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10&amp;nbsp;January 2008, the BBC reported that the passports of his closest relatives had been seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|title=Karadzic family passports seized|date=10 January 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7181568.stm|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21&amp;nbsp;February 2008, at the time [[Kosovo]] [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared independence]], portraits of Karadžić were on display during [[Belgrade]]'s "[[Kosovo is Serbia protest]]".&lt;ref&gt;Photos at {{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1715332_1538115,00.html|title=Belgrade Riots|work=TIME Magazine|accessdate=26 July 2008|date=21 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1715332_1538120,00.html|title=Belgrade Riots|work=TIME Magazine|accessdate=26 July 2008|date=21 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegedly evading capture in Austria===
There were reports that Karadžić evaded capture in May&amp;nbsp;2007 in [[Vienna]], where he lived under the name Petar Glumac, posing as a Croatian seller of herbal solutions and ointments. [[Federal Police (Austria)|Austrian police]] talked to him during the raid regarding an unrelated homicide case in the area where Karadžić lived but failed to recognize his real identity. He had obtained a [[Croatian passport]] in the name of Petar Glumac and claimed to be in Vienna for training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.at/cms/site/news_item.html?channel=CH0069&amp;doc=CMS1217014246968 |title=Karadzic nannte sich "Peter Schauspieler" |accessdate=26 July 2008 |publisher=Austria Press Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531200419/http://www.apa.at/cms/site/news_item.html?channel=CH0069&amp;doc=CMS1217014246968 |archivedate=31 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The police did not ask any further questions nor demanded to fingerprint him as he appeared calm and readily answered questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL543550020080725?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |title=Karadzic escaped arrest in Austria last year |accessdate=26 July 2008 |publisher=Reuters |first=Boris |last=Groendahl |date=25 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, this claim came into doubt when a man named Petar Glumac, an alternative medical practitioner from [[Banatsko Novo Selo]], Serbia, claims to have been the person the police talked with in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.293.html:219746-Dabic-glumio-Glumca |title=Dabić glumio Glumca |first=V. |last=Popović |website=novosti.rs |language=Bosnian |date=27 July 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glumac reportedly bears a striking resemblance to Karadžić's appearance as Dragan Dabić.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/serbia/2465136/Radovan-Karadzic-stole-a-lookalikes-image.html |title=Radovan Karadzic stole a lookalike's image |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=28 July 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dragan Karadžić, his nephew, claimed in an interview to the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' that Karadžić attended football matches of [[Serie A]] and visited [[Venice]] under the name of Petar Glumac.&lt;ref name="corriere.it"/&gt;

The arrest of Radovan Karadžić took place on 21&amp;nbsp;July 2008 in [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref name=BBC-2008-07-22/&gt; He was in hiding, posing as a doctor of alternative medicine mostly in [[Belgrade]] but also in [[Vienna]], Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wtop.com/?nid=383&amp;sid=1444312 |title=Karadzic interviewed about details of his arrest |accessdate=26 July 2008 |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Karadžić was transferred into ICTY custody in the [[Hague]] on 30 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/110336/Karadzic-being-held-in-same-jail-as-Milosevic-was|title=Karadzic being held in same jail as Milosevic |publisher=gmanews.tv |accessdate=13 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522062729/http://www.gmanews.tv/story/110336/Karadzic-being-held-in-same-jail-as-Milosevic-was |archivedate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karadžić appeared before judge [[Alphons Orie]] on 31&amp;nbsp;July, in the tribunal, which has sentenced 64 accused since 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/sid/24 |title=ICTY -TPIY: Key Figures |publisher=ICTY}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first hearing Radovan Karadžić expressed a fear for his life by saying: "If [[Richard Holbrooke|Holbrooke]] wants my death and regrets there is no death sentence at this court, I want to know if his arm is long enough to reach me here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/31/AR2008073100363.html?hpid=moreheadlines |title=Karadzic appears at UN court |work=Washington Post |date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that the deal he made with [[Richard Holbrooke]] is the reason why it took 13&amp;nbsp;years for him to appear in front of the ICTY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |agency=AFP |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gZy0ZegDYcy8yLg1vT7wnZjJcRvw |title=Holbrooke promised no ICTY trial: Karadzic |publisher=Google |date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910070936/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gZy0ZegDYcy8yLg1vT7wnZjJcRvw |archivedate=10 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made similar accusations against the former U.S. Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=AFP |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hDjfrs7G6ubbn16kfGGmiJuCRu0Q |title=US wants me dead: Karadžić |publisher=Google |date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520153719/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hDjfrs7G6ubbn16kfGGmiJuCRu0Q |archivedate=20 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhamed Sacirbey]], Bosnian foreign minister at the time, claimed that a Karadžić-Holbrooke deal was made in July 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=65316&amp;sectionid=351020606 |title=Karadzic-Holbrooke deal confirmed |publisher=Presstv.ir |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August&amp;nbsp;2008 Karadžić claimed there is a conspiracy against him and refused to enter a plea, whereupon the court entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf to all 11 charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7587623.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Karadzic refuses war crimes pleas |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the [[tribunal]], chaired by Scottish judge [[Iain Bonomy]], a "court of NATO" disguised as a court of the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cctv.com/english/20080830/100530.shtml |title=UN tribunal enters plea for Karadzic |publisher=cctv.com |date=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/30/world/europe/30hague.html?ref=europe |title=Karadzic Declines to Plead at War Crimes Court |work=New York Times |first=Marlise |last=Simons |date=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13&amp;nbsp;October 2009, the BBC reported that Karadžić's plea to be granted immunity from his charges was denied. However, the start of his trial was moved to 26 October so he could prepare a defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8305707.stm |title=Karadzic immunity appeal rejected |publisher=BBC News |date=13 October 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 26&amp;nbsp;October 2009 Karadžić's trial was suspended after 15&amp;nbsp;minutes after he carried out his threat to boycott the start of the hearing. Judge [[O-Gon Kwon]] said that in the absence of Karadžić, who was defending himself, or any lawyer representing him, he was suspending the case for 24&amp;nbsp;hours, when the prosecution would begin its opening statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Watts |date=26 October 2009 |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Radovan-Karadzic-Beast-Of-Bosnia-Boycotts-Start-Of-His-Genocide-Trial-At-The-Hague/Article/200910415417404?f=rss |title='Beast Of Bosnia' Boycotts Genocide Trial |publisher=Sky News Online |accessdate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5&amp;nbsp;November 2009, the court imposed a lawyer on him, and postponed his trial until 1&amp;nbsp;March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8344851.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Court imposes lawyer on Karadzic |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26&amp;nbsp;November 2009, Karadžić filed a motion challenging the legal validity and legitimacy of the tribunal, claiming that "the UN Security Council lacked the power to establish the ICTY, violated agreements under international law in so doing, and delegated non-existent legislative powers to the ICTY",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icr.icty.org/LegalRef/CMSDocStore/Public/English/Motions/NotIndexable/IT-95-5%2318/MOT7937R0000278701.pdf |title=IT-95-5/18: Motion challenging the legal validity and legitimacy of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (English, 16&amp;nbsp;Pages) |date=20 November 2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which the Prosecution response was that "The Appeals Chamber has already determined the validity of the Tribunal’s creation in previous decisions which constitute established precedent on this issue", therefore dismissing the Motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icr.icty.org/LegalRef/CMSDocStore/Public/English/Response/NotIndexable/IT-95-5%2318/MRA18498R0000278901.pdf |title=IT-95-5/18: Prosecution response to motion challenging the legal validity and legitimacy of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (2&amp;nbsp;Pages) |date=1 December 2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution started its case on 13&amp;nbsp;April 2010, and completed it on 25 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radovan Karadžić (IT-95-5/18) Case Information Sheet |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/cis/en/cis_karadzic_en.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204094800/http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/cis/en/cis_karadzic_en.pdf |archivedate=4 December 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of more than 300&amp;nbsp;previously unknown bodies in a mass grave at the Tomasica mine near [[Prijedor]] in September&amp;nbsp;2013 caused a flurry of motions which ended with the court denying reopening prosecutorial evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 March 2014 |newspaper=Sense Agency |title=Tomasica Evidence 'Not in the Interest of Justice' |url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/tomasica-evidence-%E2%80%98not-in-the-interest-of-justice%E2%80%99.29.html?news_id=15799 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401071558/http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/tomasica-evidence-%E2%80%98not-in-the-interest-of-justice%E2%80%99.29.html?news_id=15799 |archivedate=1 April 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defence began its case on 16&amp;nbsp;October 2012 and completed it in March&amp;nbsp;2014; Karadžić decided not to testify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Karadzic Decides not to Testify in His Own Defence |date=20 February 2014 |newspaper=Sense Agency |url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/karadzic-decides-not-to-testify-in-his-own-defense.29.html?cat_id=1&amp;news_id=15735 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227115820/http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/karadzic-decides-not-to-testify-in-his-own-defense.29.html?cat_id=1&amp;news_id=15735 |archivedate=27 February 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closing arguments in the case began on 29&amp;nbsp;September 2014 and were concluded on 7&amp;nbsp;October 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/cis/en/cis_karadzic_en.pdf Case information sheet: Radovan Karadžić], [[ICTY]]&lt;/ref&gt; Karadžić having failed in his demand for a re-trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NO RE-MATCH IN KARADZIC CASE |date=14 August 2014 |newspaper=Sense Agency |url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/no-re-match-in-karadzic-case.29.html?news_id=16054 |accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bosnian genocide trial===
Karadžić and Mladić were placed on trial for charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Srebrenica, Prijedor, Ključ, and other districts of Bosnia. They were charged, separately, with:&lt;ref&gt;Paul R. Bartrop. (20116). ''Bosnian Genocide: The Essential Reference Guide'', p.&amp;nbsp;113. ABC-CLIO. {{ISBN|9781440838699}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Count&amp;nbsp;1: Genocide. On 28&amp;nbsp;June 2012, the trial chamber granted a defence motion for acquittal on this count as "the evidence, even if taken at its highest, did not reach the level from which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that genocide occurred in the municipalities [in question]". Motions for acquittal on nine other counts were dismissed. The Appeals Chamber subsequently concluded that the court had erred and reinstated Count 1 on 11 July 2013.
** Municipalities: [[Bratunac]], [[Foča]], [[Ključ, Una-Sana Canton|Ključ]], [[Kotor Varoš]], [[Prijedor]], [[Sanski Most]], [[Vlasenica]] and [[Zvornik]].
* Count&amp;nbsp;2: Genocide.
** Municipality: [[Srebrenica]].
* Count&amp;nbsp;3: Persecutions on Political, Racial and Religious Grounds, a Crime Against Humanity.
** Municipalities: [[Banja Luka]], [[Bijeljina]], [[Bosanska Krupa]], [[Bosanski Novi]], [[Bratunac]], [[Brčko (town)|Brčko]], [[Foča]], [[Hadžići]], [[Ilidža]], [[Kalinovik]], [[Ključ, Una-Sana Canton|Ključ]], [[Kotor Varoš]], [[Novi Grad, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Novi Grad]], [[Novo Sarajevo]], [[Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Pale]], [[Prijedor]], [[Rogatica]], [[Sanski Most]], [[Sokolac]], [[Trnovo, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Trnovo]], [[Vlasenica]], [[Vogošća]], [[Zvornik]], and [[Srebrenica]].
* Count&amp;nbsp;4: Extermination, a Crime Against Humanity.
* Count&amp;nbsp;5: Murder, a Crime Against Humanity.
* Count&amp;nbsp;6: Murder, a Violation of the Laws or Customs of War.
* Count&amp;nbsp;7: Deportation, a Crime Against Humanity.
* Count&amp;nbsp;8: Inhumane Acts (forcible transfer), a Crime Against Humanity.

* Count&amp;nbsp;10: Unlawful Attacks on Civilians, a Violation of the Laws or Customs of War.
* Count&amp;nbsp;11: Taking of Hostages, a Violation of the Laws or Customs of War.

The Yugoslav war crimes court rejected on 27&amp;nbsp;June 2012 one of the two genocide charges against Karadžić.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/ind/en/markedup_indictment_091019.pdf |format= pdf |title= Prosecutor's Marked-up Indictment |id= ICTY Case No. IT-95-5/18-PT |work= The Prosecutor v Radovan Karadzic |date= 19 October 2009 |access-date= 7 June 2011 |publisher= United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mladic/ind/en/110601.pdf |format= pdf |title= Prosecutor's Marked-up Indictment |id= ICTY Case No. IT-09-92-I |work= The Prosecutor v Radovan Karadzic |edition= 2nd amended |date= 1 June 2011 |access-date= 7 June 2011 |publisher= United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 11&amp;nbsp;July 2013, the Appeals Chamber reinstated these charges.

===Conviction and sentence===
On 24&amp;nbsp;March 2016 he was found guilty of [[genocide]], [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]], and sentenced to 40&amp;nbsp;years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/24/europe/karadzic-war-crimes-verdict/index.html |title=Karadzic sentenced to 40&amp;nbsp;years for genocide |website=CNN |access-date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was found guilty of genocide for the [[Srebrenica massacre]], which aimed to kill "every able-bodied male" in the town and systematically exterminate the Bosnian Muslim community. He was also convicted of persecution, extermination, deportation, forcible transfer ([[ethnic cleansing]]), and murder in connection with his campaign to drive Bosnian Muslims and Croats out of villages claimed by Serb forces.&lt;ref name="nyt24-03-2016" /&gt;

{{Campaignbox Rif Dimashq Campaign}}
The '''Rif Dimashq clashes''' were a series of unrests and armed clashes in and around [[Damascus]], the capital of [[Syria]], from November 2011 till a stalemate in March 2012. The violence was part of the wider [[Early insurgency phase of the Syrian Civil War|early insurgency phase]] of the [[Syrian Civil War]]. Large pro-government and anti-government protests took place in the suburbs and center of Damascus, with the situation escalating when members of the [[Free Syrian Army]] started attacking military targets in November.

It is claimed that in January 2012, parts of rural Damascus and the Damascus suburbs started to fall under opposition control. On 27 January 2012, the [[Syrian Army]] launched a [[Battle of Zabadani (2012)|military operation]] which retook the Damascus suburbs and the town of [[Zabadani]] with the offensive ending on 11 February. However, fighting still continued, when on 15 February FSA fighters were seen on the streets of a district in the Damascus centre, trying to recruit and mingling with opposition protesters. A few anti-government protests were still ongoing after the army offensive.

On 12 March 2012, major clashes were reported in central Damascus between the FSA and the Syrian Army for the first time. By April 2012 a fragile cease-fire was brokered by the UN peace envoy Kofi Annan. However, following the cease fire collapse, by July 2012, rebels erupted again into most Damascus suburbs and rural areas around the city, launching the [[Battle of Damascus (2012)|Battle of Damascus]], also known as Operation Damascus Volcano.

Fourteen were killed in house-to-house raids and in protests in Damascus suburbs, and an activist in the eastern Damascus suburb of Harasta, who gave his name as Assem, said three deserters were killed after they abandoned military units which fired live ammunition at a demonstration of 1,500–2,000 people in the al-Zar neighbourhood. "Security police could not put down the demonstration.

On 6 January 2012, SANA claimed that another suicide bomber killed at least 26 when a police building or intelligence building was attacked. However, the opposition pointed the finger at the Government, saying "this is a plot staged by the government to deter thousands of people that were planning to converge on that same spot to call for the international community to step in and enforce a no-fly zone and enforce also a dramatic end to the regime". Later SANA reported the death of General [[Mohammed Abdul-Hamid al-Awwad]], claiming he was assassinated while he was headed for work in the al-Ghouta area of Damascus. His driver, who was injured, said that "As we were heading to the Brigadier General's military unit, we saw a taxi on the right of the road…it overtook us and then blocked our way. Four gunmen started shooting at us. Brigadier al-Awwad was shot in the head and I was also injured."&lt;ref name="san"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sana.sy/eng/337/2012/01/16/394558.htm |accessdate=3 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120151207/http://www.sana.sy/eng/337/2012/01/16/394558.htm |archivedate=20 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January 2012, the Syrian army launched an offensive, trying to retake some of the Damascus suburbs from rebel control. Amateur video appeared to show tanks rolling in to Al-Ghouta and Zamalka to the east. Al-Ghouta is historically known for being a hub of dissent against the Assad government, and the crackdown appeared to be an attempt "to avoid any Tahrir Square-style mass movements,".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/01/2012129131321937927.html |title=Syrian army in offensive near Damascus |publisher=Aljazeera.com |date=2012-01-29 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to activists, 14 civilians and 5 opposition fighters were killed in shelling of neighbourhoods. 2,000 pro-assad forces and 50 tanks and armoured vehicles took part in the offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yacoub |first=Khaled |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/29/us-syria-idUSTRE80S08620120129 |title=Syria troops battle to retake Damascus suburbs, 19 die |publisher=Reuters.com |date=2012-01-29 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they met fierce resistance and six government soldiers, including two officers, were killed and six wounded in the opposition controlled suburb of Sahnaya when their bus was blown up by a remote-controlled bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/jan/29/syria-6-soldiers-killed-in-bus-ambush/ |title=Syria: 6 soldiers killed in bus ambush |publisher=Utsandiego.com |date=2012-01-29 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some activists claimed that the fighting in Damascus was not unusual, and there wasn't any tanks in the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/syria-jan-29-2012-1700 |title=AJE live blog |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.net |date=2012-01-29 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others said that it was "the worst fighting around the capital in the 10-month uprising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/syria-jan-29-2012-1702 |title=Syria Live Blog |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.net |date=2012-01-29 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clashes were also reported near Damascus airport, leading to its closure.

Other Damascus suburbs that have come under fire from heavy artillery and mortar rounds from government forces include Douma, Saaba, [[Arbin, Syria|Arbin]] and Hamuriyeh, activists said. "The more the regime uses the army, the more soldiers defect," Ahmed al-Khatib, a local rebel council member on the Damascus outskirts, told the AFP news agency. A spokesperson for the rebel FSA, which at the time, had 40,000 men and whose leadership was in Turkey, said that the fighting came a day after "a large wave of defections," with 50 officers and soldiers turning their back on Assad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/syria-jan-29-2012-1817 |title=AJE live blog |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.net |date=2012-01-29 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least two generals and other "high-ranking officers" reportedly defected to the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=İpek Yezdani |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/syrian-opposition-defections-rise.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=12670&amp;NewsCatID=352 |title=Syrian opposition: defections rise |publisher=Hurriyetdailynews.com |date=2011-09-13 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two days of clashes, oppositions and FSA sources confirmed that the Syrian army gained back control of some of the eastern suburbs of Damascus from the rebels and started to make house to house checks and arrests. Hamouriyeh was taken by the Syrian government, as was Kfar Batna by the end of the clashes.

=== February 2012 ===

On 1 February 2012, the Syrian army extended their cleaning operations, with more troops moving into the mountainous area of Qalamoun, north of Damascus. Further north, the troops which took the control of Rankous, started to extend their control into farmland surrounding the city. In the eastern suburbs of Mesraba, activist reported that army snipers were positioned and that tanks were in the streets.&lt;ref name="re"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gutterman |first=Steve |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/01/us-syria-idUSTRE80S08620120201 |title=Russia says veto unacceptable Syria resolution |publisher=Reuters |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fighting in Wadi Barada, located north-west of Damascus in the Rif Damashk governorate, the Local Committee of Coordination initially reported that 12 people, including six FSA fighter, were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/01/world/meast/syria-unrest/?hpt=hp_bn2 |title=U.N.

The opposition activist group also wrongly stated that the government poisoned the water supply of Wadi Barada, however, there was no independent confirmation and no other media reported the claim. One other FSA fighter was reportedly killed in fighting in the suburb of Moadhamieh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lccsyria.org/5962 |title=Syria Today 1-2-2012 |publisher=Lccsyria.org |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2012-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806202953/http://www.lccsyria.org/5962 |archivedate=6 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Deir Kanoun and Ein al Fija were also under army assaults according to the London-based SOHR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keath |first=Lee |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/feb/1/syrian-troops-move-new-rebel-areas-near-damascus/ |title=Syrian troops move on new rebel areas near Damascus |publisher=Washingtontimes.com |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syria's state news agency SANA said a general, [[Rajeh Mahmoud]], was killed along with three other soldiers on the outskirts of Damascus.&lt;ref name="re"/&gt;

In Saqba, a working-class eastern suburb city of Damascus, had in-midst a peaceful anti-government demonstrations shortly fallen into control of a dozen armed and masked fighters from the Free Syria Army (FSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rebel fighters control Saqba|url=http://rt.com/news/damascus-captured-masked-gunmen-877/|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSA also tried to resist against retaking by the Syrian army, but was later purged. And the fighting had stopped after the soldiers cleared the area street by street. Checkpoints were manned at main intersections and FSA fighters had either fled or been killed or wounded in the fighting. Damages were visible in the streets. Bodies of killed civilians where found severely mutilated, some had their hands bound. A resident told that he saw tanks firing into shops and talked about Iranian and Hezbollah involvement while there was no other evidence of that. Some others vowed to continue to protest once the soldiers would have left. Another resident blamed the FSA for provoking a fight they could not win and said that ordinary people were paying the price of the fighting, fearing more fighting in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/gruesome-face-of-syrias-deadly-suburban-war/story-e6frg6so-1226261250916 |title=gruesome face of Syria's deadly subur|publisher=The Times|author=Richard Beeston|date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Lebanese source close to the Syrian government said that the offensive had the goal to cleanse from rebels all the areas near the capital and to set up a security zone.

On 29 June 2012 the latest development came as an activist reported a "massacre" in the Damascus suburb of Douma, about 15&amp;nbsp;km (9 miles) outside the capital Damascus. Heavy shelling was evident as the military tried to enter the suburb. 51 People were reportedly killed, including 10 who tried to flee the suburb but were stopped at a checkpoint by militiamen and executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/06/201262994612753522.html |title=Annan 'optimistic' about Syria talks|publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=29 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resident of the city meanwhile said to press that city of Douma, on suburbs of Damascus, had become effectively ghost city, with most of its 200,000 population forced to flee as a result of rebel seizing with consequent army shelling. He also reported hearing for more than a week explosions from shelling in Harasta suburb, what resulted in collapse of ordinary life in Damascus. Security forces enforced unofficial curfew after 7 or 8pm when Shabiha militias arrest anyone wandering around the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2012-06-29/damascus-resident-describes-the-collapse-of-ordinary-life/ |title=Damascus resident describes the 'collapse of ordinary life' |publisher=Itv.com |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 2012, it was reported that the military had regained control of Douma after a 10-day military offensive. Loyalists battled to control the ring of suburbs and settlements in the surrounding countryside. The army launches frequent offensives into the suburbs only to see them slip back into rebel control after they leave. Human rights groups said that conditions in Douma are miserable, with dead bodies in the streets. There is a lack of food, electricity and running water.&lt;ref name=ajdouma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/topic/syria/syria-activists-regime-troops-recover-rebellious-damascus-suburb-douma |title=Syria activists: Regime troops recover rebellious Damascus suburb of Douma – Al Jazeera Blogs |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.net |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The army was accused of damaging hospitals that treated the wounded in Douma and carrying out waves of mass arrests and also execution of Rebels.&lt;ref name=ajdouma/&gt;

Also residents reported that the army, after weeks of intensive shelling, finally managed to push its way into former rebel-controlled Douma City center and was sweeping streets in search of rebel fighters who according to other resident withdrew from city night before, after 10-day government offensive. Residents also reported decaying dead bodies lying on streets and arrest of hundreds of citizens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/topic/syria/syrian-forces-invade-damascus-suburb-after-weeks-shelling |title=Al Jazeera Live Blog |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.net |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; to check on their implication with the rebels.

On 2 July 2012, ITV News correspondent managed to get to the Irbeen suburb of Damascus with help of FSA fighters and confirmed that this and several other suburbs, including Zamalka, are completely out of government control with local rebel fighters patrolling on the streets openly.

There were also indications that the government knew about the planned rebel raid and acted on the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/721521.shtml |title=Syrian capital's clashes continue in southern part |publisher=Globaltimes.cn |date=2012-07-17 |accessdate=2012-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728161937/http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/721521.shtml |archivedate=28 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One FSA commander claimed that the Battle for "liberation" of Damascus had begun,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/41304/iraq-calls-on-citizens-in-syria-to-return-home |title=FSA: 'Battle for liberation' of Damascus has begun |publisher=Lbcgroup.tv |date=2012-07-17 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; with another dubbing it ''Operation Damascus Volcano''.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

But Tarek, the rebel spokesman in Damascus, dismissed the claims, stating the clashes were still only skirmishes. He also said the FSA didn't start the battle, which would be in line with earlier reports that the military made a preemptive strike on the opposition forces, after learning of their plan for the attack on the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weaver |first=Matthew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/17/syria-crisis-damascus-clashes-live#block-14 |title=1.44pm: Syria |publisher=Guardian |date=2012-07-17 |accessdate=2012-09-29 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2013 ==
The fifth tour featured seven bands, reaching 27 cities and dates during October and ending on November 5, 2013 in New York City.  The lineup was heavily criticized for the smaller number of bands.

[[Capture the Crown]] dropped off the tour in late October due to mechanical problems with their transportation.

Due to issues with attendance, a 2014 tour was not set up, and it is unclear whether the tour will be back again in 2015 and as of March 2016 nothing yet has been announced.&lt;ref&gt;http://substreammagazine.com/2014/09/scream-it-like-you-mean-it-not-happening-this-year/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6869">'''Shasta Regional Medical Center''', formerly known as '''Redding Medical Center''', is one of two major hospitals that are located in [[Redding, California]]. It opened in 1945 and currently has 246 beds with an acute care facility and has become a regional medical center serving far Northern California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srmc.phcs.us/about-us.html Shasta Medical Center Website]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the first fully accredited chest pain center in northern California.

==History==
It was purchased by [[Tenet Healthcare|Tenet Healthcare Corporation]] in 1976 and renamed Redding Medical Center. In 2002, amid a federal investigation of two cardiologists at the hospital, Drs. Chae Hyun Moon and Fidel Realyvasquez,&lt;ref name="investigatin"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/06/business/doctor-s-procedures-were-monitored-by-rival-hospital.html New York Times 11/6/2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/16/business/16tenet.html?_r=1 New York Times 11/16/2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/04/business/california-patients-talk-of-needless-heart-surgery.html New York Times 11/4/2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/24/AR2005072400969.html Washington Post 7/25/2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and as part of a settlement with federal regulators, Tenet Healthcare Corporation was compelled to sell the hospital to Hospital Partners of America for $60&amp;nbsp;million USD in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115480370.html Tenet Healthcare Agrees to Sell Redding, Calif., Medical Center. ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hospital Partners of America then renamed the hospital to its current name of Shasta Regional Medical Center and took measures to ensure that this incident would not occur in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redding.com/news/2008/oct/30/prime-healthcare-services-one-states-largest-hospi/ Redding.com 10/30/2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hospital Partners of America went into bankruptcy in 2008, and the hospital operations were taken over by [[Prime Healthcare Services]].

Shasta Regional is the only hospital in Shasta County certified as a Chest Pain Center and became a Primary Stroke Center for the region in 2006.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} It was the first hospital in California and 11th in the nation to be certified as an Advanced Inpatient Diabetes Care hospital in 2010 by The Joint Commission.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The hospital was named as a "Top Performer on Key Quality Measures" by The Joint Commission based on care and patient outcomes for Heart Attack, Heart Failure, Pneumonia and Surgical Care in 2010.&lt;ref name="jointcommission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jointcommission.org/top_performers_on_key_quality_measures/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001182433/http://www.jointcommission.org/top_performers_on_key_quality_measures/|archive-date=2011-10-01|dead-url=yes|title=The Joint Commission’s Top Performers on Key Quality Measures &amp;#124; Joint Commission|accessdate=2014-07-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

===Unnecessary care and billing===
At Redding Medical Center, the early-2000s investigation, raid and litigation were prompted because "physicians undertook large volumes of inappropriate and unnecessary procedures on largely healthy patients".&lt;ref name="GoWrong"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Walshe K, Shortell SM| title=When things go wrong: how health care organizations deal with major failures. | journal=[[Health Aff (Millwood)]] | year= 2004 | volume= 23 | issue= 3 | pages= 103–11 | pmid=15160808 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.23.3.103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation into Moon and Realyvasquez was the result of multiple whistleblower lawsuits filed under the Federal [[False Claims Act]] alleging unnecessary medical procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/07/17/60minutes/main563755.shtml CBS News 7/17/2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic Priest [[John Corapi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-11-10/news/17569435_1_redding-medical-center-invasive-heart-heart-surgery SFGate.com 11/10/2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Zerga and Redding physician Patrick Campbell split 15% of the total $62.55&amp;nbsp;million settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]|date=November 15, 2005|title=Redding Cardiologists Agree to Pay Millions in Settlement|url=http://mathiasconsulting.com/cases/2005/11/CA/redding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tenet had already agreed to pay $54&amp;nbsp;million in 2003 to settle the federal case without admitting any wrongdoing but with an agreement for new oversight procedures for physicians and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kaiser Health Policy Report |date=August 7, 2003|title=Tenet to pay $54M to settle allegations that surgeons performed unnecessary procedures |url=http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?hint=3&amp;DR_ID=19246}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, Tenet established a $395&amp;nbsp;million fund for 769 cardiac patients to settle civil suits relating to procedures performed by Moon and Realyvasquez.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gjel.com/verdicts/tenet1.html $117 Million: Victims of Unnecessary Heart Surgeries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kaiser Health Policy Report|date=December 22, 2004 |title=Tenet Healthcare Agrees to $395 million settlement of lawsuit filed over alleged unnecessary heart surgeries |url=http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?hint=3&amp;DR_ID=27373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence that [[Prime Healthcare Services]] engages in upcoding elderly patients to [[malnutrition]]. At Shasta Regional Medical Center, Prime reported 16.1% of their [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] patients suffered from [[kwashiorkor]]. The state of [[California]] average for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] patients is 0.2% suffering from kwashiorkor. Prime Healthcare Services is currently being investigated for [[Medicare fraud]] by [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] and the [[California Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name = "malnutrition"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williams|first=Lance|author2=Christina Jewett |author3=Stephen K. Doig |title=Hospital chain, already under scrutiny, reports high malnutrition rates |journal=California Watch|date=February 19, 2011 |url=http://californiawatch.org/health-and-welfare/hospital-chain-already-under-scrutiny-reports-high-malnutrition-rates-8786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2684">In [[philosophy]], a '''state of affairs''' ({{lang-de|Sachverhalt}}), also known as a '''situation''', is a way the [[actual world]] must be in order to make some given ''proposition'' about the actual world true; in other words, a state of affairs (situation) is a ''truth-maker'', whereas a [[proposition]] is a ''truth-bearer''. Whereas states of affairs (situations) either ''obtain'' or ''fail-to-obtain'', propositions are either ''true'' or ''false''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/states-of-affairs/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[David Malet Armstrong]] is well known for his defence of a '''factualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, a position according to which the world is a world of facts and not a world of things.&lt;ref&gt;David Armstrong, ''A World of States of Affairs'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In a sense of "state of affairs" favored by [[Ernest Sosa]], states of affairs are situational [[Condition (philosophy)|conditions]]. In fact, in the ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'',&lt;ref name=Sosa&gt;[[Ernest Sosa]], 1999. "Condition".  ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''.  R.Audi, Ed.  Cambridge: Cambridge UP. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Sosa defines a condition to be a state of affairs, "way things are" or situation—most commonly referred to by a [[nominalization]] of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. The expression "Snow's being white", which refers to the condition snow's being white, is a nominalization of the sentence "Snow is white".&lt;ref name=Sosa/&gt; "The [[truth]] of the proposition that "snow is white" is a nominalization of the sentence "the proposition that snow is white is true". Snow's being white is a necessary and sufficient condition for the truth of the proposition that snow is white. Conditions in this sense may be called situational.

Usually, [[necessity and sufficiency]] relate conditions of the same kind. Being an animal is a necessary attributive condition for being a dog.  Fido's being an animal is a necessary situational condition for Fido's being a dog.

The '''TVB Star Awards Malaysia''' ({{zh|s=TVB 马来西亚星光荟萃颁奖典礼}}) is an annual awards ceremony honoring Cantonese programming achievements in [[Television in Malaysia|Malaysia]]. It is produced by [[TVB|TVB Entertainment News]], with [[Astro (television)|Astro]] and MY FM as media partners. The ceremony was previously known as the '''My AOD Favourites Awards''' ({{zh|s=MY AOD我的最爱颁奖典礼}}), which succeeded the '''Astro Wah Lai Toi Drama Awards''' ({{zh|s=Astro华丽台电视剧大奖}}).

The Malaysian television channel [[Astro Wah Lai Toi]], presented by Astro, airs Hong Kong television programmes produced by [[TVB]]. In 2005, Astro organised its first awards ceremony, the [[2004 Astro Wah Lai Toi Drama Awards]], presenting awards to Hong Kong actors and actresses for their acting achievements in TVB television dramas. [[TVB|TVB Entertainment News]] took over the production of the awards series in 2013, renaming it The TVB Star Awards. It has since become an annual event, and is regarded as a prelude to Hong Kong's [[TVB Anniversary Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://img.b.tvb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/tvbi/files/2014/02/20131201_tvb-star-awards-malaysia-2013_post.pdf |title=The Star-studded Malaysian TV Awards Presentation, TVB Star Awards Malaysia 2013”, Chilam Cheung and Linda Chung were crowned my favourite actor and actress | publisher=TVBI Company Limited |format=PDF |access-date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[2015 TVB Star Awards Malaysia|most recent awards show]] took place on 28 November 2015.

The nominations for the TVB Star Awards are jointly determined by Astro and TVB for TVB programmes shown on [[Astro Wah Lai Toi]] throughout the designated year. Winners are decided by the Malaysian public. Presently, voting is done through a mobile app produced by TVB and Astro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Astro ZhongWen | url=http://zhongwen.astro.com.my/Channels/WLT/ArticleDetails.aspx?ArticleId=5866 | title=《TVB 马来西亚星光荟萃颁奖典礼 2015》 正式揭开序幕 |trans-title=The TVB Star Awards Malaysia 2015 has arrived | date=2015-10-13 | accessdate=2015-10-27 | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hoober-Bloob Highway''''' is an [[animation|animated]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[television special|special]] written by [[Dr. Seuss]] and produced by [[DePatie–Freleng Enterprises]]. The special first aired February 19, 1975 on [[CBS]], and was the last Dr. Seuss special produced for that network. Seuss also composed the song lyrics, which were set to music by [[Dean Elliott]]. 

Mr. Hoober-Bloob, a [[dispatcher]] of newborn children from some location in space, is preparing to send a new child down his [[highway]] to [[Earth]], but first, he gives the child a chance to decide for himself whether he wants the life of a human. Mr. Hoober-Bloob shows him the realistic problems and pleasures that people face in life. The story suggests that while things may be pretty bad, there's always something to be thankful for.

==Plot==
The titular highway is a long and winding road that leads to [[Earth]] from an area high up in space where [[Pregnancy|newborn babies come from]]. The plot revolves around a newborn child, referred to as "Bub", as he tries to decide what he wants out of its life, or even if he wants to go at all, before being sent down the Hoober-Bloob Highway to be born.

Mr. Hoober-Bloob, with the help of a [[lute]] with arms and legs that often breaks into fast-paced solos (which annoys Mr. Hoober-Bloob), explains to the child what to expect in human life. His explanations are often accompanied by musical [[sketch comedy|vignettes]] of the baby, depicted as a pre-adolescent boy, in an unusual situation that accompanies the song (such as being placed in front of a long and quickly scrolling tape with checkboxes on it and being expected to check the boxes quickly in the "Answer Yes or No" segment). Eventually, the baby makes the decision to depart for the world below, and Mr. Hoober-Bloob excitedly pushes his carriage down the Hoober-Bloob Highway at last.

{{The Route of the K-Money}}
'''The Route of the K-Money''' ({{lang-es|La ruta del dinero K}}; "K" stands for "''[[Kirchnerism]]''") was a 2013 political scandal in Argentina. It began with reports on the ''[[Periodismo para todos]]'' television program on the results of its investigation, led by journalist [[Jorge Lanata]]. [[Embezzlement]] and an associated [[money trail]] involved Argentine presidents [[Néstor Kirchner]], [[Cristina de Kirchner]] and their employee, businessman [[Lázaro Báez]].&lt;!-- contractor? associate? verify --&gt; The investigation concluded that Báez diverted money intended for public infrastructure to [[tax haven]]s. The scandal led to an official investigation.&lt;ref name="Mercopress"&gt;

[[File:Lanata400.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Smiling man dressed in blue, standing in front of books|Jorge Lanata in 1994; ''Periodismo para todos'' host]]
''Periodismo para todos'' began its 2013 season on April 14. [[Jorge Lanata]] reported that according to the tax return [[Néstor Kirchner]] sent to the AFIP, the Argentine revenue-collection agency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afip.gob.ar/english/|title=''Administracion Federal''|website=AFIP|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he and wife [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] had personal wealth of US$1.4&amp;nbsp;million when he became president in 2003. She was elected president four years later; when Néstor Kirchner died in 2010, their assets were US$14.1&amp;nbsp;million. Lanata said that there was also a large amount of undeclared money.

The first program included interviews with [[Leonardo Fariña]] and [[Federico Elaskar]], who detailed methods used by Lázaro Báez to send €55&amp;nbsp;million to tax havens. Báez, a businessman from [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz Province]], was a close friend of Néstor Kirchner. Fariña worked for Báez, and Elaskar headed SGI (a financial firm used for [[money laundering]]).&lt;ref name="comercio"&gt;

[[Eduardo Arnold]], vice-governor of Santa Cruz during Néstor Kirchner's presidency, said on the TV program ''[[La cornisa]]'' that in 2001 Cristina Kirchner showed him a [[bank vault|vault]] in her home in [[El Calafate]] for the family's savings; Arnold suspected that the vault, larger than a home safe, confirmed the alleged money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;

In later programs, Lanata presented more evidence for the allegations. The second episode focused on the relationship between Báez and the Kirchners. Lanata documented agreements between Báez and Néstor Kirchner authorizing a builder, Austral Construcciones (owned by Báez), to build apartments on land owned by Kirchner. These documents had already been sent to the courts by deputy Elisa Carrió, who alleged illegal collaboration by Báez, Kirchner and minister [[Julio de Vido]].&lt;ref name="lanjus"/&gt; Lanata also detailed unusual growth in Báez's finances since the beginning of the Kirchner presidencies, and favoritism toward Austral Construcciones in the awarding of the majority of public contracts in the province.&lt;ref&gt;

On April 28, Lanata detailed links between minister [[Julio de Vido]], Kirchner and Báez. De Vido allegedly requested bribes for Báez. Estela Kank, former owner of Kank y Costilla, described collusion by De Vido and Báez to force her to sell her company to Báez.&lt;ref&gt;

On August 18 Lanata said that according to official reports, Cristina Kirchner visited the [[Seychelles]] on January 21 and 22, although there was no record of presidential activities on those days. The islands were mentioned by Elaskar as a fiscal destination. Several months after her visit, Seychelles no longer met the criteria for [[tax haven]]s. Lanata also said that Néstor Kirchner created a [[Shell corporation|shell subsidiary]] of his [[Panama]]nian corporation in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;

===Judiciary===
[[File:Elisa Carrió - Diputados.jpg|thumb|alt=Smiling, blonde woman with multicolored scarf|Deputy Elisa Carrió filed a court case.]]
Several politicians petitioned the courts after the first program was aired. Deputy [[Elisa Carrió]] filed a case with judge [[Julián Ercolini]], who was already investigating Lázaro Báez for conspiracy. Ercolini gave Carrió's case to a Kirchner supporter, judge [[Sebastián Casanello]]. Prosecutor Guillermo Marijuan began an investigation; attorney Alejandro Sánchez Kalbermatten filed a similar case against Lázaro Báez, his sons Martín Báez and Leandro Báez, Daniel Pérez Gadín and Fabián Rossi after Carrio's, but before her case was given to Casanello. The prosecutor was Miguel Ángel Osorio. Attorney Ricardo Monner Sans and deputies [[Manuel Garrido]] and [[Graciela Ocaña]] filed additional cases. Since the cases were similar, President of the Federal Chamber [[Martín Irurzun]] had to decide which judge would preside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1573164-la-oposicion-presento-cinco-denuncias-por-el-escandalo-de-lazaro-baez|title= La oposición presentó cinco denuncias por el escándalo de Lázaro Báez|trans-title=The opposition presented five denouncements for the Lázaro Báez scandal|language= Spanish|author= |date= April 16, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canicoba Corral rejected the case and sent it to Casanello, who sent it to the Federal Chamber;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1573576-el-juez-casanello-remitio-las-denuncias-sobre-presunto-lavado-de-dinero-a-la-camara-federal|title= El juez Casanello remitió las denuncias sobre presunto lavado de dinero a la Cámara Federal|trans-title=Judge Casanello sent the denounces about alleged money laundering to the Federal Chamber|language= Spanish|author= |date= April 17, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casanello was finally confirmed as judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1573584-casanello-sera-el-juez-que-investigara-el-presunto-lavado-de-dinero-de-baez|title= El juez Casanello investigará a Báez por "asociación ilícita y encubrimiento"|trans-title=Judge Casanello will investigate Báez for "illicit association and concealment"|language= Spanish|author= |date= April 17, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canicoba Corral roled that although a hidden camera may be acceptable as proof in [[investigative journalism]], it is inadmissible in court, adding that he had not analyzed the case and had no opinion. Argentine [[case law]] does not accept hidden cameras as proof of  crime, since they constitute [[self-incrimination]]. However, they are admissible when  witnesses have conflicting testimony; an unedited film may clarify which witness is more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1573450-canicoba-resto-valor-a-las-camaras-ocultas|title= Canicoba restó valor a las cámaras ocultas|trans-title=Canicoba dismissed the value of the hidden cameras|language= Spanish|author= |date= April 17, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors Ramiro González and Carlos Gonella asked Casanello for an investigation of Fariña and Elaskar when he was confirmed as judge. Their initial request did not mention Lázaro Báez or the Kirchners, but was open to expansion. The prosecutors requested unedited copies of both films aired by ''Periodismo para todos'' and the later TV programs, where Fariña and Elaskar said that they had lied.&lt;ref name="farelaros"/&gt; Jorge Lanata gave his testimony to the prosecutor [[José María Campagnoli]] on April 22.&lt;ref name="lanjus"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1575139-jorge-lanata-declaro-ante-la-justicia-por-las-denuncias-de-lavado-de-dinero-de-su-programa|title= Jorge Lanata declaró ante la Justicia por las denuncias de lavado de dinero de su programa|trans-title=Jorge Lanata gave testimony to the judiciary for the denounces in his program|language= Spanish|author= |date= April 22, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Mario Cimadevilla]] of the [[Radical Civic Union]] criticized Gils Carbó for the appointment of prosecutors, including Gonella, without Senate approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1575691-denunciaron-a-gils-carbo-por-designar-fiscales-ilegalmente|title= Denunciaron a Gils Carbó por designar fiscales ilegalmente|trans-title=Gils Carbó was denounced for appointing prosecutors illegally|language= Spanish|author= Hernán Cappiello|date= April 24, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbó streamlined the appointment system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1576024-tras-la-denuncia-cambian-los-concursos-de-fiscales|title= Tras la denuncia, cambian los concursos de fiscales|trans-title=After the denouncement, the system for appointing prosecutors is changed|language= Spanish|author= |date= April 25, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the charges against him were dropped ten days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1579571-la-justicia-cerro-la-causa-contra-gils-carbo-por-las-designaciones-ilegales-de-fiscales|title= La Justicia cerró la causa contra Gils Carbó por las designaciones ilegales de fiscales|trans-title=The judiciary closed the case against Gils Carbó for the appointment of prosecutors|language= Spanish|author= Paz Rodriguez Niell|date= May 7, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guillermo Marijuan appealed this, saying that he had received death threats against his daughters and was receiving protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1580197-a-pesar-de-las-amenazas-marijuan-apelo-contra-su-jefa-gils-carbo|title= A pesar de las amenazas, Marijuan apeló contra su jefa, Gils Carbó|trans-title=Despite the threats, Marijuan appealed against his chief, Gils Carbó|language= Spanish|author= Paz Rodriguez Niell|date= May 9, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campagnoli mentioned that the AFIP, IGJ and Migrations{{clarify|date=June 2014}} refused to give him information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1585311-el-fiscal-denuncio-que-la-afip-la-igj-y-migraciones-le-negaron-informacion|title= El fiscal denunció que la AFIP, la IGJ y Migraciones le negaron información|trans-title=The prosecutor denounced that the AFIP, IGJ and Migrations refused information|language= Spanish|author= Hernán Cappiello|date= May 25, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrió provided photos and a witness to the emptying of a vault at Báez's house in Santa Cruz; Casanello gave the witness protection, and proposed to send the case to the judiciary of the Santa Cruz province. Marijuan, however, thought it should be incorporated into the existing case.

The [[Uruguayan Air Force]] and Uruaguayan customs began an informal investigation of the Uruguayan link.

Initially, the government had no comment about the controversy.&lt;ref name="Mercopress" /&gt; Only deputy [[Carlos Kunkel]] said that although he did not know Lázaro Báez, if he committed a crime he had to go to prison; however, he thought there was insufficient evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1573225-carlos-kunkel-dijo-que-si-se-prueba-que-lazaro-baez-cometio-un-delito-deberia-ir-preso|title= Carlos Kunkel dijo que si se prueba que Lázaro Báez cometió un delito, debería ir "preso"|trans-title=Carlos Kunkel said that, if it proved that Lázaro Báez committed a crime, he should go to prison|language= Spanish|author= |date= April 16, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor of Santa Cruz province [[Daniel Peralta]] denied any connection to Báez, saying that public works in the province were financed by the national government since 2008 through [[Vialidad Nacional]]. Once a Kirchner supporter, Peralta had turned to [[Federal Peronism]]. He said that the national government had invested [[Argentine peso|$]]770&amp;nbsp;million in public works from 2007 to 2012, and that control of such finances was the purview of the [[Sindicatura General de la Nación|SIGEN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1573461-el-cruce-de-denuncias-hace-crecer-el-scandalo-en-santa-cruz|title= En Santa Cruz el escándalo crece por el cruce de denuncias|trans-title=The scandal grows in Santa Cruz because of the crossed denounces|language= Spanish|author= Mariela Arias|date= April 17, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minister [[Julio de Vido]] considered the scandal an attempt to halt construction of the dams [[Néstor Kirchner Dam|Néstor Kirchner]] and [[Jorge Cepernic Dam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1573556-julio-de-vido-jorge-lanata-leonardo-farina|title= De Vido habla de una "operación mediática para parar" la construcción de dos represas|trans-title=De Vido talks about a "media operation" to halt the construction of two dams|language= Spanish|author= |date= April 17, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Báez, in a [[news conference]] where he took no questions, considered it an attempt to defame Néstor Kirchner; he questioned Fariña and Elaskar's reliability and the authenticity of the documents shown on the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1574432-lazaro-baez-me-quisieron-usar-como-forro-de-un-amigo-que-era-nestor-kirchner|title= Lázaro Báez: "Me quieren utilizar de forro para manchar la imagen de mi amigo Néstor"|trans-title=Lázaro Báez: "They want to use me as a condom to stain the image of my friend Néstor"|language= Spanish|author= Mariela Arias|date= April 19, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Leonardo Fariña was the husband of television personality [[Karina Jelinek]], the government tried to treat the program's revelations as a dispute between TV presenters on its controlled TV channels to discredit it.&lt;ref name="Mendelevich158" /&gt; It hoped focusing Fariña would deflect attention from Kirchner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1573167-eing l-gobierno-buscara-farandulizar-el-caso|title= El gobierno buscará farandulizar el caso|trans-title=The government will attempt to trivialize the case|language= Spanish|author= |date= April 16, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attempt failed, and the extended coverage increased awareness of the controversy among the apolitical population. Details of the money's being weighed (instead of counted) and politicians' home vaults increased lay understanding of the corruption controversy's scope.&lt;ref name="Mendelevich158"&gt;Mendelevich, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Public interest in the controversy resembled that in a [[telenovela]]; a large portion of the population awaited each new airing of ''Periodismo para todos'', and its revelations were discussed during the week. A survey concerning the controversy found that 80% of the respondents followed it, 70% thought the accusations were true and 65% thought it affected the president's public image. Two-thirds of the respondents agreed that the level of corruption during the Kirchner presidencies was similar (or higher) than that during the presidency of [[Carlos Menem]]. Public reception of the controversy may have been influenced by the ongoing [[Argentine economic crisis]], the suspicion of presidential involvement and Lanata's persuasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1580958-el-caso-baez-un-escandalo-de-repercusion-inedita|title= El caso Báez, un escándalo de repercusión inédita|trans-title=The Baez case, a scandal of unprecedented repercution|language= Spanish|author= Eduardo Fidanza|date= May 11, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government tried to shrink the audience for ''Periodismo para todos'' by rescheduling the most-important soccer match of the week against it. The tactic was unsuccessful; Lanata received 24.7 rating points, compared with 16 for the Boca-[[Newell's Old Boys]] match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com.uy/mundo/mundo-lanata-gobierno-quiere-rating.html|title= Que Mujica "se ponga de acuerdo" con su ministro sobre si hay lavado|trans-title=Let Mujica "come to an agreement" with his minister about the presence of embelezzment|language= Spanish|author= |date= May 27, 2013|work= |publisher= El País|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Jorge Fernández Díaz said that soccer matches had not been scheduled so late the previous year, when ''Periodismo para todos'' had an average of 15 ratings points instead of 25.&lt;ref name="futbol" /&gt; The June 16 match between [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] and [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]] violated an [[Argentine Football Association]] rule requiring the last two matches of teams with chances to win a tournament to be played concurrently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1592823-por-cuarta-semana-consecutiva-jorge-lanata-le-gano-al-futbol|title= Por cuarta semana consecutiva, Jorge Lanata le ganó al fútbol|trans-title=For the fourth consecutive week, Jorge Lanata prevailed over soccer|language= Spanish|author= |date= June 17, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aranhas. ninho. Vilarromaris. Galiza.jpg|thumb|right|Newly hatched ''[[Araneus diadematus]]'']]
'''The Spider Bite''' or '''The Red Spot''' is a modern [[urban legend]] that emerged in Europe during the 1970s.

==Plot==
The legend features a young woman from an ordinary, northern location ([[England]], [[New York City]], etc.), who is on vacation abroad in an exotic, southern location ([[Mexico]], [[South America]], etc.). While sunbathing on the beach, she is bitten on the cheek by a spider. The bite swells into a large boil and she rushes home to seek medical treatment. She finds a doctor to lance the boil then hundreds of tiny spiders come running out of her cheek. She then goes insane from the shock.

==Variations==
In other versions, a young girl is asleep while a spider crawls across her face and rests on her cheek for a few moments. The next morning, she asks her mother about the red spot on her cheek and the mother responds, "It looks like a spider bite. It will go away, just don't scratch it." As time passes, the spot grows into a small boil. She confronts her mother again and complains that it is getting larger and that it's sore. The mother replies, "That happens sometimes, it's coming to a head." More days pass and the girl complains that it hurts and is unsightly. Finally concerned that it might be infected, the mother agrees to take her to a doctor, but he is not available until the next day. In order to soothe herself that evening, the girl takes a bath. As she soaks, the boil bursts and releases a swarm of baby spiders into the water from the eggs that the mother had laid.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz; p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  

In telling the story, there are versions that are set in one's own country instead of being abroad (''e.g.,'' a Midwestern woman who is bitten in [[California]]). Usually, when the story is told to others, the location of the incident is quite specific.

==History==
The legend of ''The Spider Bite'' emerged as a modern legend in Europe in the late 1970s, but it echoes earlier manifestations of the bosom-serpent story type, where all types of creatures enter the body and sometimes reproduce there.&lt;ref&gt;Brunvand; p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; Modern folklorists adopted the term bosom-serpent from [[Nathaniel Hawthorne|Nathaniel Hawthorne's]] 1843 short story, [[Egotism; or, The Bosom-Serpent|''Egotism, or, the Bosom Serpent'']]. The term is now used to generalize other legends in which living creatures enter the human body. In bosom-serpent type legends, the creatures usually have to be removed surgically, but sometimes they depart on their own, or even burst from the skin.&lt;ref&gt;Brunvand; p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
This urban legend provides a social commentary about the perception of the people who consider southern locales to be less clean, and more dangerous than their own home turf. Spiders are loathed by many people, but venomous, hairy, or especially large spiders make frequent appearances in legends.&lt;ref&gt;Brunvand; p. 409&lt;/ref&gt; Spiders in urban legends have often taken cover in a variety of items ranging from cactus plants and food, to hairdos and within the human body, so it is natural to have a fear of invasion. [[Bengt af Klintberg]]'s work in urban legends elaborates and explains that as a consequence of the absence of spiders in the modern urban environment, they have now assumed mythical proportions in our narrative tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Af Klintberg; pp. 274—287&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts have also suggested that bosom-serpent legends may represent pregnancy fears or fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;Brunvand; p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zimelidine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]) (brand names '''Zimeldine''', '''Normud''', '''Zelmid''') was one of the first [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) [[antidepressant]]s to be marketed. It is a pyridylallylamine, and is structurally different from other antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Barondes, Samuel H. | title = Better Than Prozac | pages = 39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimelidine was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s by [[Arvid Carlsson]], who was then working for the [[Sweden|Swedish]] company [[AstraZeneca|Astra AB]]. It was discovered following a search for drugs with structures similar to [[brompheniramine]] (it is a [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of brompheniramine), an [[antihistamine]] with antidepressant activity. Zimelidine was first sold in 1982.&lt;ref name=Fagius&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=1028185| year=1985| author1=Fagius| first1=J| title=Guillain–Barré syndrome following zimeldine treatment| journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry| volume=48| issue=1| pages=65–69| last2=Osterman| first2=P. O.| last3=Sidén| first3=A| last4=Wiholm| first4=B. E.| doi=10.1136/jnnp.48.1.65| pmid=3156214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While zilmelidine had a very favorable safety profile, within a year and a half of its introduction, rare case reports of  [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] emerged that appeared to be caused by the drug, prompting its manufacturer to withdraw it from the market.&lt;ref name=Fagius/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=11691978| year=2001| author1=Carlsson| first1=A| title=A paradigm shift in brain research| journal=Science| volume=294| issue=5544| pages=1021–4| doi=10.1126/science.1066969| bibcode=2001Sci...294.1021C}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its withdrawal, it was succeeded by [[fluvoxamine]] and [[fluoxetine]] (derived from the antihistamine [[diphenhydramine]]) in that order, and the other SSRIs.

==Mechanism of action==
The mode of action is a strong reuptake inhibition of [[serotonin]] from the synaptic cleft. Postsynaptic receptors are not acted upon.

==Other uses==
Zimelidine was reported by Montplaisir and Godbout to be very effective for [[cataplexy]] in 1986, back when this was usually controlled by [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, which often had [[anticholinergic]] effects.&lt;ref name=cataplexy&gt;{{cite journal | author=Godbout R, Montplaisir J.| title=The effect of zimelidine, a serotonin-reuptake blocker, on cataplexy and daytime sleepiness of narcoleptic patients| journal=Clinical Neuropharmacology| volume=9| issue=1| year=1986| pages=46&amp;ndash;51 | pmid=2950994| doi=10.1097/00002826-198602000-00004| last2=Montplaisir}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimelidine was able to improve cataplexy without causing daytime sleepiness.&lt;ref name=cataplexy/&gt;

==Side effects==
Most often reported were:

* Dry mouth, dryness of [[pharynx|pharyngeal]] and nasal membranes
* Increased sweating ([[hyperhidrosis]])
* [[Vertigo (medical)|Vertigo]]
* [[Nausea]]

==Interactions==
* [[MAOIs|MAO inhibitor]]s — severe or life-threatening reactions possible{{medcn|date=March 2016}}
