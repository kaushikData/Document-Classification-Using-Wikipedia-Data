__NOTOC__
Year '''484 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Mamercus and Vibulanus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 270 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 484 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6120">'''Al-Walid ibn Tarif al-Shaybani''' ({{lang-ar|ÿßŸÑŸàŸÑŸäÿØ ÿ®ŸÜ ÿ∑ÿ±ŸäŸÅ ÿßŸÑÿ¥Ÿäÿ®ÿßŸÜŸä}}) was an eighth-century [[Khawarij|Kharijite]] leader. In 794 he launched a rebellion against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], but was defeated and killed in 795.

== Career ==
[[File:Al-Jazira.svg|thumb|300px|Map of the Jazira and surrounding regions]]
In several sources al-Walid is referred to as a member of the [[Taghlib|Banu Taghlib]], but [[Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani]] and [[Ibn Khallikan]] call him a [[Shayban (tribe)|Shaybani]], and in the opinion of [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]] the latter identification is the correct one.{{sfn|Al-Tabari|1989|loc=p. 143 n. 524}} He was considered a chief of the Kharijites, and reportedly acquired a reputation for audacity and bravery. During his lifetime he usually resided in the area of [[Nusaybin|Nasibin]] and [[Khabur (Euphrates)|al-Khabur]], in the region of the [[Upper Mesopotamia|Jazira]].{{sfn|Ibn Khallikan|1868|p=668}}

In 794 al-Walid revolted against the Abbasid caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] and quickly gathered a large number of supporters around him. He soon overran much of the Jazira and killed the governor of [[Diyar Rabi'a]] when the latter marched against him, then invaded [[Diyar Mudar]] and besieged '[[Abd al-Malik ibn Salih]] in [[Raqqa]]. The Kharijites subsequently moved on to [[Arminiya]] and besieged [[Ahlat|Khilat]], whose inhabitants agreed to ransom themselves in exchange for their liberty, and proceeded to invade [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Adharbayjan]], [[Hulwan]], the [[Sawad]] of [[Iraq]] and the districts on the west bank of the [[Tigris]], enriching themselves along the way. They then returned to the Jazira, causing devastation to the province, and gained additional followers for their cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Tabari|1989|pp=143, 153}}; {{harvnb|Ibn Khallikan|1868|p=668}}; {{harvnb|Ibn Khallikan|1871|p=218}}; {{harvnb|Ibn al-Athir|1987|p=302}}; {{harvnb|Khalifah ibn Khayyat|1985|pp=450, 451‚Äì452}}; {{harvnb|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|pp=495‚Äì96}}; {{harvnb|Eisenstein|2002|pp=129‚Äì30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to stop the Kharijites, Harun al-Rashid sent two armies in succession against them, but they were defeated by the rebels and both of their commanders died in combat. The caliph then put [[Yazid ibn Mazyad al-Shaybani]] in command of a large army and dispatched him against al-Walid, urging him to bring an end to the insurgency as soon as possible. Yazid met the rebels in battle in late 795, at [[Haditha|al-Haditha]] above [[Hƒ´t|Hit]], and defeated al-Walid in [[single combat]], killing him and cutting off his head. Yazid also killed a large number of the Kharijites and forced the remainder to disperse, and the revolt ended in defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Tabari|1989|pp=143, 153, 154}}; {{harvnb|Ibn Khallikan|1868|pp=668‚Äì70}}; {{harvnb|Ibn Khallikan|1871|pp=218‚Äì220}}; {{harvnb|Ibn al-Athir|1987|pp=302‚Äì04}}; {{harvnb|Khalifah ibn Khayyat|1985|pp=451‚Äì452}}; {{harvnb|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|p=496}}; {{harvnb|Eisenstein|2002|p=130}}, Some of the specific details of the revolt are given differently in the sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Walid was elegised after his death by his sister, the warrior and poet [[LaylƒÅ bint ·π¨arƒ´f]].&lt;ref&gt;''Classical Poems by Arab Women: A Bilingual Anthology'', ed. and trans. by Abdullah al-Udhari (London: Saqi Books, 1999), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Alabama Jubilee.jpg|thumb|left|Hot air balloons inflating at the 2005 Alabama Jubilee]]
The Alabama Jubilee Hot-Air Balloon Classic, one of the oldest hot-air balloon races in the mid-South, started in [[Decatur, AL]] in 1978 with competition among 17 balloonists from [[Alabama]], [[Kentucky]], [[Ohio]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]]. It was a showcase for the new Decatur balloon, one of the first to represent a city, and an event to kick off Alabama's tourism season. The Jubilee now draws about 60 pilots from 20 states for two days of friendly competition during the annual [[Memorial Day]] holiday weekend.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=="The Ballooning Capital of Alabama"==
The continued popularity of the Alabama Jubilee prompted the Alabama Legislature to designate the City of [[Decatur, AL|Decatur]] as the ‚ÄúBallooning Capital of [[Alabama]].‚Äù{{cn|date=November 2017}} 

The Jubilee has been named a Top 20 Tourism Event in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] for May by the [[Atlanta, GA|Atlanta]]-based [[Southeast Tourism Society]].{{cn|date=November 2017}}

==Location==
The Alabama Jubilee is held on the grounds of [[Point Mallard Park]], a municipal recreation complex that offers a {{convert|35|acre|m2|sing=on}} water park featuring an aquatic center with a wave pool, [[Olympic-sized swimming pool]]s, [[lazy river]], and several [[water slide]]s, as well as tennis courts, ball fields, hiking trails, campground, 18-hole championship golf course, indoor ice skating rink and recreation center.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Alleged rape in Le M√©ridien hotel ==
Alicia Gali had been working as a beauty salon manager in the [[Le M√©ridien]] Al Aqah Beach Resort, [[Fujairah]].&lt;ref&gt;Hotelier Middle East, [http://www.hoteliermiddleeast.com/17264-starwood-respond-to-rape-claim-womens-tv-report/#.UekH022BZHk "Starwood respond to rape claim women's TV report"], 19 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She spent an evening drinking with three co-workers. She claimed that when she woke up the next day, she was "naked, with broken ribs and massive bruising" but admitted she had no memory of the night before. Her co-workers denied under oath that there was any assault, and testified in court that Gali consented to have sex with them. They allege that her injuries were caused by her falling whilst dancing on a table.&lt;ref name="dj"/&gt;

== Jail period ==
Following the alleged rape, Gali contacted an Australian consular officer in neighbouring [[Dubai]]. She was not warned that unproven rape complaints could lead to sex outside marriage charges under the local law.&lt;ref name="abc_au"/&gt; Gali had reported the alleged rape to the local police. However, the men testified in court that the sex was consensual and no evidence could be provided that rape occurred. Gali and the accused men were arrested and all were sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 12 months&lt;ref name=btimes1&gt;{{cite news|title=Drugged, raped, then jailed for 'adultery'|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/world/drugged-raped-then-jailed-for-adultery-20110328-1cd7p.html?from=brisbanetimes_sb|accessdate=23 May 2013|newspaper=[[Brisbane Times]]|date=28 Mar 2011|author=Dan Nancarrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; for having an extra-matrimonial sexual relationship.

== Lawsuit against the Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide ==
Gali has sued her employers at the Starwood hotel for breaching its workplace obligations by failing to have a systems in place to protect their workers against assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.allafrica.com/stories/201103290751.html|title=Duba√Ø - Un Mauricien accus√© de viol par une coll√®gue australienne|date=29 March 2011|work=[[AllAfrica.com]]|language=French|accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel management claimed to have offered Gali the required support after the case.&lt;ref name=btimes2&gt;{{cite news|title=Hotel defends itself over raped employee|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/world/hotel-defends-itself-over-raped-employee-20110329-1cemf.html|accessdate=23 May 2013|newspaper=Brisbane Times|date=30 Mar 2011|author=Dan Nancarrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publicity ==
The Australian government requested Gali's family not to publicize the case during her imprisonment period.&lt;ref name=abc_au/&gt; Gali's release, her criticism of the Australian consular service and her lawsuit against the Starwood hotel network gained international media attention. The story was published in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'',&lt;ref name="huffington"/&gt; A 30-minute documentary film about the case was published in  [[Yahoo!

The '''All Good Music Festival and Camp Out''' was a weekend-long event held annually in July. Since its inception in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;[http://festivalpreview.com/festival/all-good-music-festival-campout] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531015427/http://www.festivalpreview.com/festival/all-good-music-festival-campout |date=2010-05-31 }} All Good Music Festival Campout&lt;/ref&gt; it had been held at venues along the Mid-Atlantic, including [[Masontown, West Virginia]] and locations in Maryland and Virginia, most notably [[Marvin's Mountaintop]]. It moved to Legend Valley in [[Thornville, Ohio]] in 2012. All Good announced they would be taking a short hiatus in 2014 and not be having a festival. They returned in 2015 in [[Summit Point, West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author =Chelsea DeMello | title =Board of Zoning Appeals rules in favor of All Good Festival | website =[[The Journal (West Virginia newspaper)|The Journal]] | date =October 3, 2014 | url =http://www.journal-news.net/page/content.detail/id/619243/Board-of-Zoning-Appeals-rules-in-favor-of-All-Good-Festival.html | accessdate = February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headlining acts were [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[moe.]] and [[Cake (band)|Cake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author =Dave Emke | title =Primus, Cake to headline All Good Music Festival | website =[[The Journal (West Virginia newspaper)|The Journal]] | date =February 17, 2015 | url =http://www.journal-news.net/page/content.detail/id/628606/Primus--Cake-to-headline-All-Good-Music-Festival.html?nav=5281 | accessdate = February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it was announced the festival had been retired and would be replaced by a two-day event at [[Merriweather Post Pavilion]].

==Background==

The event was organized by Walther Productions and included mostly [[jam band|jam]] and [[folk music|folk]] acts, though the festival had expanded its musical repertoire to include reggae, hip-hop fusion, bluegrass, funk, and rock.  The 15th Annual festival was held July 14‚Äì17, 2011 on Marvin's Mountain Top in [[Masontown, West Virginia|Masontown]], West Virginia. The lineup had included artists such as [[Furthur (band)|Furthur]], [[Derek Trucks]], [[Railroad Earth]], [[Keller Williams]], [[The Flaming Lips]], [[Phil Lesh and Friends]], [[Widespread Panic]], [[Umphrey's McGee]], [[The String Cheese Incident]], [[Les Claypool]], [[Ratdog]], [[Moe.]], [[Lotus (American band)|Lotus]], [[Bassnectar]], [[Old Crow Medicine Show]], The New Deal, [[Grace Potter and the Nocturnals]], [[Yonder Mountain String Band]], [[Dark Star Orchestra]], and [[Leftover Salmon]].
[[File:Festival Kite.JPG|thumb|left|Kite flying at All Good.]]
The festival generally featured three performance spaces: the main stage, flanked by a smaller stage, and the Grassroots stage located by Shakedown Street. The two main stages in the concert area operated with no overlapping sets, allowing festival-goers the unique opportunity to see all of the music scheduled at the festival. The location of the main stage at the bottom of a hill created a natural amphitheater with the music from the stage projected to the maximum number of listeners sitting on the hill; the mountains of West Virginia serving as backdrop.

==Legal action==
A Virginia driver, Clay Lewin, crashed into a tent of sleeping women at the West Virginia festival site near Masontown in July 2011. Nicole Miller, 20, of [[South Carolina]], died in the accident, with two friends severely injured‚ÄîYen Ton and Elizabeth Doran, both of [[Mount Pleasant, South Carolina]]. Lewin, of [[Cape Charles, Virginia]], lost control of his pickup but blames parking and security agents who guided him to the "steep, grassy slope near tents and other vehicles."

Lewin, Ton, Doran and Kim Miller sued campground operator Marvin‚Äôs Mountaintop LLC; Walther Productions; California-based Tobin Productions; M&amp;M Parking Inc. of Pennsylvania; and three security providers, Event Staffing Inc. of Virginia, National Event Services, Inc. of [[New Hampshire]], and Axis Security Inc. of Tennessee. Some principals are being sued as individuals; all have denied culpability, filing counterclaims against each other.&lt;ref name="Claims Journal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Vicki|title=Virginia Man Settling Lawsuits in West Virginia Festival Death|url=http://www.claimsjournal.com/news/east/2012/08/01/211089.htm|accessdate=20 December 2012|newspaper=Claims Journal|date=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2011, Tim Walther sent a request to [[Caroline County, VA]] to ask for a change in a music ordinance. He wanted to move the annual show from West Virginia to Moss Neck Manor, a 1,200-acre site in [[Port Royal, VA]] off U.S. 17 owned by the Silver Cos. The festival would feature 14 to 16 hours of music a day, twice as much as the county allows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4644">'''Anna Perenna''' was an old [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] deity of the circle or "ring" of the year, as the name (''per annum'') clearly indicates. Her festival fell on the [[Ides of March]] (March 15), which would have marked the first full moon in the year in the old lunar [[Roman calendar]] when March was reckoned as the first month of the year, and was held at the grove of the goddess at the first milestone on the [[Via Flaminia]]. It was much frequented by the city ''[[plebs]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Anna Perenna|volume=2|page=63|first=William Warde|last=Fowler|authorlink=William Warde Fowler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macrobius]] records that offerings were made to her ''ut annare perannareque commode liceat'', ''i.e.'' "that the circle of the year may be completed happily"&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; and that people sacrificed to her both publicly and privately.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Saturnalia (Macrobius)|Saturnalia]]'' 1.12.6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Lydus]] says that public sacrifice and prayers were offered to her to secure a healthy year.&lt;ref&gt;''De Mensibus'' 4.49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovid]] in his ''Fasti'' (3.523f) provides a vivid description of the revelry and licentiousness of her outdoor festival where tents were pitched or bowers built from branches, where lad lay beside lass, and people asked that Anna bestow as many more years to them as they could drink cups of wine at the festival.

==Origin==
[[File:Dido sobre la pira.png|thumb|''Suicide of Dido,'' a representation of Dido being rescued by her sister Anna, later identified with the Roman divinity Anna Perenna, [[Oil painting|oil on canvas]] by [[Guercino]], 1625, [[Rome]], [[Galleria Spada]].]]
Ovid reports a legend that identifies Anna Perenna with the sister of [[Dido]], the Carthaginian founder in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''.&lt;ref name=OV&gt;[[Ovid]]. ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', Book III, March 15.&lt;/ref&gt; After Dido's tragic death, Anna finds refuge from her brother [[Pygmalion of Tyre|Pygmalion]] on [[Malta]], with [[Battus of Malta|Battus]], the king of the island and a wealthy host.&lt;ref name=OV /&gt; Upon protecting Anna for three years, Battus counselled her to flee for her safety and find a fresh place of exile as her brother was seeking war. Forced again to flee over the seas, Anna Perenna was shipwrecked on the coasts of [[Latium]] where she was hosted by [[Aeneas]]' settlement of [[Lavinium]]. Anna's presence there made [[Lavinia]] increasingly jealous. Dido appeared in Anna's dream, exhorting her to abandon her latest refuge, from where she was swept away by the river [[Numicus]] and transformed into a river nymph hidden in the "perennial stream" (''amnis perennis''), and renamed Anna Perenna.&lt;ref name=OV /&gt;

Ovid adds that some equate Anna Perenna with the Moon, with [[Themis]], with [[Io (mythology)|Io]] or with [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amaltheia]], but prefers the report that during the ''[[secessio plebis]]'' an old woman of Bovillae named Anna baked cakes every morning and brought them to the hungry rebels, in gratitude for which the plebeians worshipped her as a goddess.  Ovid goes on to report that after old Anna had become a goddess, she impersonated [[Minerva]] to gain admission to the god [[Mars (god)|Mars]]' bedchamber, which is why coarse jokes and coarse songs are used at Anna Perenna's festivities, and remarks that since the festival of Anna Perenna is in the month dedicated to Mars, it is reasonable that Mars and Anna Perenna should be associated as cult partners.

[[Franz Altheim]], an authority on Roman religion,&lt;ref&gt;R√∂mische Religionsgeschichte. 3 B√§nde. de Gruyter, Berlin 1931‚Äì1933&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Anna Perenna was originally an Etruscan [[mother goddess]], and that her relationship with Aeneas was developed to strengthen her association with Rome.

== Cult==
Two places of worship of Anna Perenna are attested. One in [[Buscemi]], [[Sicily]], where in 1899 some inscriptions to Anna and [[Apollo]] were found, and in Rome, where a fountain devoted to Anna Perenna rites was unearthed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duke.edu/web/classics/grbs/FTexts/47/Mastroc.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614073220/http://duke.edu/web/classics/grbs/FTexts/47/Mastroc.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beale Papers.gif|thumb|250px|Cover of ''The Beale Papers'']]
The '''Beale ciphers''' (or '''''Beale Papers''''') are a set of three [[ciphertext]]s, one of which allegedly states the location of a buried [[treasure]] of gold, silver and jewels estimated to be worth over [[United States dollar|US$]]43&amp;nbsp;million {{as of|2018|January|lc=y}}. Comprising three ciphertexts, the first (unsolved) text describes the location, the second (solved) ciphertext the content of the treasure, and the third (unsolved) lists the names of the treasure's owners and their [[next of kin]].

The story of the three ciphertexts originates from an 1885 pamphlet detailing treasure being buried by a man named Thomas J. Beale in a secret location in [[Bedford County, Virginia]], in the 1820s. Beale entrusted a box containing the encrypted messages to a local innkeeper named Robert Morriss and then disappeared, never to be seen again. According to the story, the innkeeper opened the box 23&amp;nbsp;years later, and then decades after that gave the three encrypted ciphertexts to a friend before he died. The friend then spent the next twenty years of his life trying to decode the messages, and was able to solve only one of them which gave details of the treasure buried and the general location of the treasure. The unnamed friend then published all three ciphertexts in a pamphlet which was advertised for sale in the 1880s.

Since the publication of the pamphlet, a number of attempts have been made to decode the two remaining ciphertexts and to locate the treasure, but all efforts have resulted in failure.&lt;ref name=nickell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Beale Treasure Ciphers |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |author= |year=1999 |url=http://www.simonsingh.com/Beale_Treasure_Ciphers.html |accessdate=2007-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230080207/http://www.simonsingh.com/Beale_Treasure_Ciphers.html |archivedate=2006-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Famous Unsolved Codes and Ciphers |author-first=Elonka |author-last=Dunin |author-link=Elonka Dunin |date=2003-12-08 |url=http://www.elonka.com/UnsolvedCodes.html |access-date=2007-04-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423224405/http://www.elonka.com/UnsolvedCodes.html |archivedate=23 April 2007 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%20Disk3/Watertown%20Times/Watertown%20NY%20Daily%20Timers%201972%20May%20Grayscale.pdf/Watertown%20NY%20Daily%20Timers%201972%20May%20Grayscale%20-%200137.pdf |date=5 May 1972 |work=[[Washington Post]] |title=Leading cryptanalysts seek to break secret code reported to tell of buried treasure in Virginia |author-last=Burchard |author-first=Hank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many arguments that the entire story is a hoax, including the 1980 article "A Dissenting Opinion" by cryptographer [[Jim Gillogly]], and a 1982 scholarly analysis of the ''Beale Papers'' and their related story by [[Joe Nickell]], using historical records that cast doubt on the existence of Thomas J. Beale. Nickell also presents linguistic evidence demonstrating that the documents could not have been written at the time alleged (words such as "stampeding", for instance, are of later vintage). His analysis of the writing style showed that Beale was almost certainly James B. Ward, whose 1885 pamphlet brought the Beale Papers to light. Nickell argues that the tale is thus a work of fiction; specifically, a "secret vault" allegory of the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]]; James B. Ward was a Mason himself.&lt;ref name="nickell"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nickell |first=Joe |title=Discovered: The secret of Beale's treasure |journal=The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography |date=July 1982 |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=310‚Äì324 |jstor=4248566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
A single pamphlet published in 1885, entitled ''The Beale Papers'', is the only source of this story. The treasure was said to have been obtained by an American named Thomas J. Beale in the early 1800s, from a mine to the north of Nuevo M√©xico (New Mexico), at that time in the Spanish province of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico]] (an area that today would most likely be part of [[Colorado]]). According to the pamphlet, Beale was the leader of a group of 30&amp;nbsp;gentlemen adventurers from [[Virginia]] who stumbled upon the rich mine of gold and silver while hunting buffalo. They spent 18&amp;nbsp;months mining thousands of pounds of precious metals, which they then charged Beale with transporting to Virginia and burying in a secure location. After Beale made multiple trips to stock the hiding place, he then encrypted three messages: the location, a description of the treasure, and the names of its owners and their relatives. The treasure location is traditionally linked to [[Montvale, Virginia|Montvale]] in [[Bedford County, Virginia]].

Beale placed the ciphertexts and some other papers in an iron box. In 1822 he entrusted the box to a [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] innkeeper named Robert Morriss. Beale told Morriss not to open the box unless he or one of his men failed to return from their journey within 10 years. Sending a letter from St.&amp;nbsp;Louis a few months later, Beale promised Morriss that a friend in St.&amp;nbsp;Louis would mail the [[key (cryptography)|key]] to the cryptograms, however, it never arrived. It was not until 1845 that Morriss opened the box. Inside he found two plaintext letters from Beale, and several pages of ciphertext separated into Papers "1", "2", and "3". Morriss had no luck in solving the ciphers, and decades later left the box and its contents to an unnamed friend.

The friend, then using an edition of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] as the key for a modified [[book cipher]], successfully deciphered the second ciphertext which gave a description of the buried treasure. Unable to solve the other two ciphertexts, the friend ultimately made the letters and ciphertexts public in a pamphlet entitled ''The Beale Papers'', which was published by yet another friend, James B. Ward, in 1885.

Ward is thus not "the friend". Ward himself is almost untraceable in local records except that a man with that name owned the home in which a Sarah Morriss, identified as the spouse of Robert Morriss, died at age 77, in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Lynchburg Virginian |date=21 May 1865 |title=Sarah Morriss |department=obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also is recorded as becoming a Master Mason in 1863.&lt;ref name=nickell /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Deciphered message==
The [[plaintext]] of Paper #2 reads:&lt;blockquote&gt;I have deposited in the county of Bedford, about four miles from Buford's, in an excavation or vault, six&amp;nbsp;feet below the surface of the ground, the following articles, belonging jointly to the parties whose names are given in number three, herewith:

The first deposit consisted of ten hundred and fourteen pounds of gold, and thirty-eight hundred and twelve pounds of silver, deposited Nov. eighteen nineteen. The second was made Dec. eighteen twenty-one, and consisted of nineteen hundred and seven pounds of gold, and twelve hundred and eighty-eight of silver; also jewels, obtained in St.&amp;nbsp;Louis in exchange to save transportation, and valued at thirteen thousand dollars.

The above is securely packed in iron pots, with iron covers. The vault is roughly lined with stone, and the vessels rest on solid stone, and are covered with others. Paper number one describes the exact locality of the vault, so that no difficulty will be had in finding it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second cipher can be decrypted fairly easily using any copy of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], but some editing for spelling is necessary. To decrypt it, one finds the word corresponding to the number (''e.g.'', the first number is 115, and the 115th word in the Declaration of Independence is "instituted"), and takes the first letter of that word (in the case of the example, "I").

Beale used a version of [[United States Declaration of Independence]] different from the original. To extract the hidden message, the following 5&amp;nbsp;modifications must be applied to the original text:

* after word 154 ("institute") and before word 157 ("laying") one word must be added (probably "a")
* after word 240 ("invariably") and before word 246 ("design") one word must be removed
* after word 467 ("houses") and before word 495 ("be") ten words must be removed
* after word 620 ("eat") and before word 654 ("to") one word must be removed
* after word 677 ("foreign") and before word 819 ("valuable") one word must be removed

Furthermore:

* The first letter of the 811th word of the modified text ("fundamentally") is always used by Beale as a "y"
* The first letter of the 1005th word of the modified text ("have") is always used by Beale as an "x"

Finally, in the decoded text there are 4 errors, probably due to wrong transcription of the original paper:

* 84 (should be 85) 63 43 131 29 ... ''consistcd'' ("consisted")
* 53 (should be 54) 20 125 371 38 ... ''rhousand'' ("thousand")
* ... 84 (should be 85) 575 1005 150 200 ... ''thc'' ("the")
* ... 96 (should be 95) 405 41 600 136 ... ''varlt'' ("vault")

===Value===
The treasure's total weight is about 3&amp;nbsp;[[ton]]s as described in inventory of the second cryptogram. This includes approximately 35,052&amp;nbsp;[[troy oz]] gold, 61,200&amp;nbsp;[[troy oz]] silver (worth about US$42&amp;nbsp;m and US$1&amp;nbsp;m, respectively, in January 2017&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kitco.com/gold.londonfix.html&lt;/ref&gt;) and jewels worth around US$220,000 in 2017. 

==Real or hoax?==
There has been considerable debate over whether the remaining two ciphertexts are real or [[hoax]]es. An early researcher, Carl Hammer of [[UNIVAC|Sperry UNIVAC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Burchard |author-first=Hank |newspaper=Washington Post |date=7 September 1979 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19790907&amp;id=RP0jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pWcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6966,3100111 |title=Motley group gathers to solve ciphers to treasure}}&lt;/ref&gt; used [[supercomputer]]s of the late 1960s to analyze the ciphers and found that while the ciphers were poorly encoded, the two undeciphered ones did not show the patterns one would expect of randomly chosen numbers and probably encoded an intelligible text.&lt;ref name="Biggest Secrets"&gt;{{cite book |title=Biggest Secrets |last=Poundstone |first=William |author-link=William Poundstone |year=1993 |publisher=[[William Morrow and Company]] |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-688-11529-2 |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other questions remain about the authenticity of the pamphlet's account. In the words of one researcher "To me, the pamphlet story has all the earmarks of a fake .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [There was] no evidence save the word of the unknown author of the pamphlet that he ever had the papers."&lt;ref&gt;Dr.&amp;nbsp;Clarence Williams, a researcher at the Library of Congress, in 1934. (No source given.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The pamphlet's background story has several implausibilities, and is based almost entirely on [[circumstantial evidence]] and [[hearsay]].
* Later [[cryptographer]]s have claimed that the two remaining ciphertexts have statistical characteristics which suggest that they are not actually encryptions of an English plaintext.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.fortunecity.com/jpeschel/gillog3.htm |title=The Beale Cipher: A Dissenting Opinion |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060126085231/http://members.fortunecity.com/jpeschel/gillog3.htm |archive-date=26 January 2006 |author-first=James |author-last=Gillogly |author-link=James Gillogly |work=''[[Cryptologia]]'' |date=April 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myoutbox.net/blove.htm |title=The Beale Ciphers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420134206/http://www.myoutbox.net/blove.htm |date=20 April 2006|archivedate=20 April 2006 |author-first=George |author-last=Love}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alphabetical sequences such as ''abfdefghiijklmmnohpp'' are both non-random, as indicated by Carl Hammer,&lt;ref name="Biggest Secrets"/&gt; and not words in English.
* Others have also questioned ''why'' Beale would have bothered writing three different ciphertexts (with at least two keys, if not ciphers) for what is essentially a single message in the first place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/pro/bealeciphers/Graphics/Bamboozlement1.pdf |title=A basic probe of the Beale Cipher as bamboozlement |author-first=Louis |author-last=Kruh |work=''[[Cryptologia]]'' |date=October 1982 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly if he wanted to ensure that the next of kin received their share (as it is, with the treasure described, there is no incentive to decode the third cipher).&lt;ref name="Biggest Secrets" /&gt;
* [[Stylometrics|Analysis of the language]] used by the author of the pamphlet (the uses of punctuation, relative clauses, infinitives, conjunctives, and so on) has detected significant correlations between it and the writing style of Beale's letters, including the plaintext of the second cipher, suggesting that they may have been written by the same person.&lt;ref name=nickell /&gt;
* The letters also contain several English words, such as "improvise", not otherwise recorded before the 1820s in English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lEQ5AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA509&amp;dq=improvise&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizsvik-_7KAhVGHD4KHYFaAXM4ChDoAQgkMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=improvise&amp;f=false |title=Improvise |magazine=The New Monthly Magazine and Literary Journal |volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;; but  used from French from 1786 in the New Orleans area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=improvisation |title=improvisation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''stampede'' (Spanish) "an uproar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=stampede&amp;searchmode=phrase |title=''stampede'' from estamper 1823 (intransitive)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beale's "stampeding" apparently first appears in print in the English Language in 1832&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r8REAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=stampeding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf4rnq8P7KAhVIWz4KHT5CDHM4HhDoAQgkMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=stampeding&amp;f=false |title=Etiquette, the American Code of Manners}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was used from 1786-1823 in New Orleans in French and Spanish.&lt;ref name=nickell /&gt;
* The second message, describing the treasure, has been deciphered, but the others have not, suggesting a deliberate ploy to encourage interest in deciphering the other two texts, only to discover that they are hoaxes. In addition, the original sale price of the pamphlet, 50&amp;nbsp;cents, was a high price for the time (adjusted for [[inflation]], it is equivalent to ${{inflation|US|0.50|1885|r=2}} today{{Inflation-fn|US}}), and the author writes that he expects "a wide circulation".
* The third cipher appears to be too short to list thirty individuals' next of kin.&lt;ref name="Biggest Secrets" /&gt;
* If the Declaration of Independence is used as a key for the first cipher, it yields alphabetical sequences such as ''abfdefghiijklmmnohpp''&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite book |last=Singh |first=S |title=The Code Book |year=2000 |publisher=Fourth Estate |location=page 97 |isbn=1-85702-889-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. According to the [[American Cryptogram Association]], the chances of such sequences appearing multiple times in the one ciphertext by chance are less than one in a hundred million million.&lt;ref name=Singh/&gt;  Although it is conceivable that the first cipher was intended as a [[proof of concept]] letting decoders know that they were "on the right track" for one or more of the subsequent ciphers, such a proof would be redundant, as the success of the key with respect to the second document would provide the same evidence on its own.
* Robert Morriss, as represented in the pamphlet, says he was running the Washington Hotel in 1820. Yet contemporary records show he did not start in that position until at least 1823.&lt;ref name="Poundstone 127‚Äì28"&gt;Poundstone, 127‚Äì128.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many attempts to break the remaining cipher(s). Most attempts have tried other historical texts as keys (e.g., the [[Magna Carta]], various books of the [[Bible]], the [[U.S. Constitution]], and the Virginia Royal Charter), assuming the ciphertexts were produced with some book cipher, but none have been recognized as successful to date. Breaking the cipher(s) may depend on random chance (as, for instance, stumbling upon a book key if the two remaining ciphertexts are actually book ciphers); so far, even the most skilled [[cryptanalysts]] who have attempted them have been defeated. Of course, Beale could have used a document that he had written himself for either or both of the remaining keys or either a document of his own or randomly selected characters for the third source, in either case rendering ''any'' further attempts to crack the codes useless.

=== Did Thomas J. Beale exist? ===
A survey of [[U.S. Census]] records in 1810 shows two persons named Thomas Beale, in Connecticut and New Hampshire. However, the population schedules from the 1810 U.S. Census are completely missing for seven states, one territory, the District of Columbia, and 18 of the counties of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~troutt/~troutt/Miscellaneous/MissingCensus.htm |title=Missing Federal Census Schedules}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1820 U.S. Census has two persons named Thomas Beale, Captain Thomas Beale of the battle of New Orleans 1815 in Louisiana originally from Virginia Botetourt County ‚Äì Fincastle area 12&amp;nbsp;miles from Bedford County and one in Tennessee, and a Thomas K. Beale in Virginia, but the population schedules are completely missing for three states and one territory.

Before 1850 the U.S. Census recorded the names of only the heads of households; others in the household were only counted.  Beale, if he existed, may have been living in someone else's household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=National Archives and Records Administration |url=https://www.archives.gov/genealogy/census/1790-1840.html |title=Clues in Census Records, 1790-1840 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719221317/http://www.archives.gov/genealogy/census/1790-1840.html |archive-date=19 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a man named "Thomas Beall" appears in the customer lists of St.&amp;nbsp;Louis Post Department in 1820. According to the pamphlet, Beale sent a letter from St.&amp;nbsp;Louis in 1822.&lt;ref name=Singh /&gt;

Additionally, a Cheyenne legend exists about gold and silver being taken from the West and buried in mountains in the East, dating from roughly 1820.&lt;ref name=Singh /&gt;

===Poe's alleged authorship===
[[Edgar Allan Poe]] has been suggested as the pamphlet's real author because he had an interest in cryptography. It was well known he placed notices of his abilities in the [[Philadelphia]] paper ''Alexander's Weekly (Express) Messenger'', inviting submissions of ciphers which he proceeded to solve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silverman |first=Kenneth |year=1991 |authorlink=Kenneth Silverman |title=Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-Ending Remembrance |publisher=Harper Perennial |location=New York |edition=Paperback |isbn=978-0-06-092331-0|page=152 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843 he used a cryptogram as [[plot device]] in his short story "[[The Gold-Bug]]". From 1820, he was also living in [[Richmond, Virginia]] at the time of Beale's alleged encounters with Morriss. In February 1826 Poe enrolled as a student at the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]].&lt;ref name="Poundstone 126"&gt;Poundstone, 126.&lt;/ref&gt; But with mounting debts, Poe left for [[Boston]] in April 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyers |first=Jeffrey |authorlink= |year=1992 |title=Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy |publisher=Cooper Square Press |location=New York |edition=Paperback |pages= |isbn=978-0-8154-1038-6|page=32 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, research and facts debunk Poe's authorship. He died in 1849 well before ''The Beale Papers'' were first published in 1885. The pamphlet also mentions the [[American Civil War]] that started in 1861. [[William Poundstone]], an American author and skeptic, had [[stylometrics|stylometric analysis]] performed on the pamphlet for his 1983 book ''Biggest Secrets'', it found that Poe's [[prose]] is significantly different from the [[Syntax|grammatical structure]] used by the author who wrote ''The Beale Papers''.&lt;ref name="Poundstone 133"&gt;Poundstone, 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Search attempts ==
Despite the Beale Papers' unproven veracity, this has not deterred treasure hunters from trying to find the vault. The "information" that there is buried treasure in Bedford County has stimulated many expeditions with shovels, and other implements of discovery, looking for likely spots. For more than a hundred years, people have been arrested for trespassing and unauthorized digging; some of them in groups as in the case of people from Pennsylvania in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Singh /&gt;

Several digs were completed at the top of Porter's Mountain, one in late 1980s with the land owner's permission as long as any treasure found was split 50/50. However, the treasure hunters only found [[American Civil War|Civil War]] artifacts. As the value of these artifacts paid for time and equipment rental, the expedition broke even.&lt;ref name=Singh /&gt;

==Media attention==
The story has been the subject of multiple television documentaries, such as the UK's ''Mysteries'' series, a segment in the third episode of ''Unsolved Mysteries''; and the 2011 ''Declaration of Independence'' episode of the History Channel TV show ''Brad Meltzer's Decoded''. There are also several books, and considerable Internet activity. In 2014, the [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] TV show ''The Numbers Game'' referred to the Beale ciphers as one of the strongest passwords ever created. In 2015 the [[UKTV]] series ''Myth Hunters'' (also known as ''Raiders of the Lost Past'') devoted one of its season 3 episodes to the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4586658/  |accessdate=5 June 2018 |title=The Mystery of Thomas Beale's Treasure|work=IMDb }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2015, the [[Josh Gates]] series ''[[Expedition Unknown]]'' visited Bedford to investigate the Beale Ciphers and search for the treasure.

[[Simon Singh]]'s 1999 book ''[[The Code Book]]'' explains the Beale cipher mystery in one of its chapters.&lt;ref name=Singh/&gt;

In 2010, an award-winning animated short film was made concerning the ciphers called ''The Thomas Beale Cipher''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thomasbealecipher.com/index.htm |title=The Thomas Beale Cipher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bonifacio Day''' is a [[Public holidays in the Philippines|national holiday]] in the [[Philippines]], commemorating [[Andr√©s Bonifacio]], one of the country's [[National hero of the Philippines|national heroes]]. He was the founder and eventual ''Supremo'' of the [[Katipunan]], a secret society that triggered the [[Philippine Revolution]] of 1896 against the [[Spanish Empire]].

==Observance==
Bonifacio Day is held on 30 November. Unlike [[Rizal Day]] commemorates on his death anniversary, Bonifacio Day is celebrated on his birthdate. This is because Bonifacio was assassinated under orders of [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], the [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|first]] [[President of the Philippines]] and leader of the Magdalo faction that rivalled Bonifacio‚Äôs Magdiwang party. Aguinaldo at the time was in league with American troops, who were slowly arriving to occupy the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publicholidays.ph/bonifacio-day/ |title=Bonifacio Day 2017 and 2018 ‚Äî Public Holidays Philippines |publisher=Publicholidays.ph |date= |accessdate=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="officeholidays1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/philippines/bonifacio_day.php |title=Bonifacio Day &amp;#124; Philippines |publisher=Office Holidays |date= |accessdate=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bonifacio Day became a holiday when the [[Philippine Legislature]] passed Act No. 2946, declaring November 30 of every year as a national holiday in remembrance of the birth of ''[[Gat (title)|Gat]]'' Andr√©s Bonifacio who started the Revolution to overthrow the Spanish colonial government. The holiday was first instituted in 1921 with a decree signed by American [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Francis Burton Harrison]].&lt;ref name="officeholidays1"/&gt;

Many interrelated political, cultural, socio-economic and geographical factors contributed to the merger of the [[French Establishments in India]] with the Republic of India.

*Language: [[Tamil language|Tamil]].
*Culture: There the culture and way of life of people was typical [[Tamil people|Tamil]] lifestyle. It was the only colony in French India which does not have much of cultural and linguistic differences w.r.t [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondich√©ry]].
*External factors: The changes political movements in Pondich√©ry and [[Madras State]] used to have very impact on Karikal.

*Sphere of Influence: It was completely out of [[sphere of influence]] of [[Pondicherry district|Pondich√©ry]].

==Geographical and cultural divergence==
Geographical and cultural divergence in the [[French India]] made the French weak in keeping their hold on these colonies.

==Decolonization phenomenon==
[[Decolonization]] was a global phenomenon which was predominant in the [[Colonial empires|colonial world]] between 1940 and the 1960s. Many colonies sought independence from the [[colonial empires]]. [[Nationalism]] and [[Socialism]] played an important role in achieving this in many colonies globally.

==Pre-Independence factors==
*'''[[Demographics|Insignificance in population and area]]''': This was one of very dominant causes for liberation of French colonies in India.
** [[Territory (country subdivision)|Insignificance in territorial size]]: The insignificance in area compared with the [[Indian Union]]. The total area of the settlements was well under {{convert|2000|sqmi|km2}}, that of the Union (excluding [[Kashmir]]) well over {{convert|1000000|sqmi|km2}}.
** Insignificant in population size: The insignificance in population compared with [[Indian Union]]. The total population of the settlements was less than 500,000 inhabitants on the eve of merger.
* '''Lack of clearcut frontiers with India''': Very few of the settlements had clear-cut frontiers with India. There were many [[enclave]]s entirely surrounded by [[British India|Indian territory]], especially in [[Pondicherry district]].
* '''Economic Factors''': The very economic existence of the settlements depended on Indian goodwill.
* '''Lack of military resistance''': If India wished to annex the settlements forcibly there was very little that France could do to stop her.

The above four factors are most important factors that existed in 1947 which ultimately led to merger of French colonies in India.

==Post-Independence factors==
After independence, the factors that lead to merger are,
* '''[[Indian Nationalism]]''': With the [[Independence of India]] in 1947, there was rise of [[Indian nationalism]] in the people of the colonies in India. This was clearly seen by the rise of nationalist local parties in those regions. Their increasing dominance in the politics of French India created an anti-French feeling in people.
* '''[[Socialists|Shift of Socialists]]''': This was the most important Post-independent cause, probably the sole cause that led ultimately to the liberation of French colonies in [[India]]. The members of the [[French India Socialist Party]] shifted their stance towards pro-Merger nationalist groups. This gave a catastrophic and devastating effect to the French rule in India. The switch of [[√âdouard Goubert]] towards pro-Merger camp became the death knell to the French sovereignty in its colonies.

==Immediate causes for independence==

===Governor's interference===
A momentous event in the independence movement of [[Puducherry|Pondich√©ry]] occurred on 18 March 1954, when most of the members of the executive council and mayor of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondich√©ry]] and seven adjoining communes proclaimed their decision to merge with [[Indian Union]] without a [[referendum]]. All the communes in [[Karikal]] also followed suit. This decision was to be confirmed by the Representative Assembly and when the French India Socialist Party was preparing to move the merger resolution, the French Governor scuttled it by postponing the session. Provoked by this, the [[Socialists]] planned to capture the outlying communes one by one and move to [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondich√©ry]]. Accordingly, the leaders of the French India Socialist Party hoisted the [[Indian National Flag]] atop the Nettapakkam police station on the last day of March in 1954.

Result of [[Governor General]]'s interference,
*Capture of Nettapacom commune.
*Capture of Mannadipet and Bahour communes.
*Formation of [[Provisional government]] at Nettapacom.
* Formation of Liberated Government of Mannadipet at Thirubuvanai.

===Kandamangalam Conference===
The conclusion of [[Consul General]], Sri [[Kewal Singh]] on the night of 11 April 1954 at the conference at Kandamangalam, that ''For real liberation of colonies one should attack any of the big four French settlements'', Since the French authorities are making fun of petty [[provisional government]] at Nettapacom.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Since [[Yanam, French India|Yanam]] is small in area and population, he requested Monsieur Dadala for a plan for its liberation which resulted not only the '''[[Coup d'√âtat de Yanaon]]''' but also the ultimate liberation of French colonies in India.

Result of conclusion at Kandamangalam conference,
*[[Coup d'√âtat de Yanaon]] under [[Dadala Raphael Ramanayya]] on Sunday, 13 June 1954. [[Yanam, French India|Yanaon]] taken by [[Indian Military]].
*[[Picketing (protest)|Picketing]] by Mahajana Sabha under [[I. K. Kumaran]] at [[Mah√©, India|Mah√©]], 16 June 1954. [[Mah√©, India|Mah√©]] gains independence, it was handed over by its Administrator to people.

'''''Copenhagen''''' is a play by [[Michael Frayn]], based on an event that occurred in [[Copenhagen]] in 1941, a meeting between the [[physicist]]s [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]]. It premiered in London in 1998 at the National Theatre, running for more than 300 performances, starring [[David Burke (British actor)|David Burke]] (Niels Bohr), [[Sara Kestelman]] (Margrethe Bohr), and [[Matthew Marsh (actor)|Matthew Marsh]] (Werner Heisenberg).

It opened on Broadway at the [[Royale Theatre]] on 11 April 2000 and ran for 326 performances. Directed by [[Michael Blakemore]], it starred [[Philip Bosco]] (Niels Bohr), [[Michael Cumpsty]] (Werner Heisenberg), and [[Blair Brown]] (Margrethe Bohr). It won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Play, Best Featured Actress in a Play, [[Blair Brown]], and Best Direction of a Play (Michael Blakemore).

In 2002, the play was [[Copenhagen (TV film)|adapted as a film]] by [[Howard Davies (director)|Howard Davies]], produced by the [[BBC]] and presented on the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) in the United States.

==Summary==
The spirits of Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr and Bohr's wife Margrethe, meet after their deaths to attempt to answer the question that Margrethe poses in the first line of the play, "Why did he [Heisenberg] come to Copenhagen?" They spend the remainder of the two-act drama reliving the experience and presenting, debating and rejecting theories that may answer that question.

'''''Heisenberg''''' ‚Äì "No one understands my trip to Copenhagen. Time and time again I‚Äôve explained it. To Bohr himself, and Margrethe. To interrogators and intelligence officers, to journalists and historians. The more I've explained, the deeper the uncertainty has become. Well, I shall be happy to make one more attempt."

Along the way, Heisenberg and Bohr "draft" several versions of their 1941 exchange, arguing about the ramifications of each potential version of their meeting and the motives behind it. They discuss the idea of nuclear power and its control, the rationale behind building or not building an [[atomic bomb]], the uncertainty of the past and the inevitability of the future as embodiments of themselves acting as particles drifting through the [[atom]] that is Copenhagen.

==Characters==
In most dramatic works where the characters are based on real people, there is a point at which the character deviates from the real person. Michael Frayn works to keep this distinction as small as possible. Having studied memoirs and letters and other historical records of the two physicists, Frayn feels confident in claiming that "The actual words spoken by [the] characters are entirely their own." With that in mind, the character descriptions apply to both the representative characters as well as the physicists themselves. There is a great amount known about all of the primary characters presented in ''Copenhagen''; the following includes those bits of information which are directly relevant and referenced in the work itself.&lt;ref&gt;Much of the above is based on ''Biographies of Persons in Copenhagen'', compiled by Harry Lustig&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Werner Heisenberg''''' was born in 1901 in [[W√ºrzburg]], Germany. The son of a university professor, Heisenberg grew up in an environment with an intense emphasis on academics, but was exposed to the destruction that [[World War I]] dealt to Germany at a rather young age. He married Elisabeth Schumacher, also the child of a professor, and they had seven children. He received his doctorate in 1923 from the physicist [[Arnold Sommerfeld]], and went to Copenhagen to study [[quantum mechanics]] with Niels Bohr in 1924, when he was 22, and replaced Bohr's assistant, [[H. A. Kramers]]. In 1926, The [[University of Leipzig]] offered him the opportunity to become Germany's youngest full professor. Heisenberg is best known for his "Uncertainty Principle," (translated from the German ''Ungenauigkeit'' [inexactness] or ''Unsch√§rfe'' [lack of sharpness] Relation, which was later changed to ''Unbestimmtheit'' meaning "indeterminate.") In 1927, he and Bohr presented the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. During the Second World War, Heisenberg worked for Germany, researching atomic technology and heading their nuclear reactor program. After the war, his involvement with the Nazis earned him certain notoriety in the world of physicists, mainly due to the fact that he could have given [[Hitler]] the means to produce and use nuclear arms. He continued his research until his death in 1976 in [[Munich]].
*'''''Niels Bohr''''' was born in 1885, making him 38 when Heisenberg first came to work with him. He married Margrethe Norlund in 1912 in Copenhagen and together they had six sons, two of whom died. [[Michael Jackson|Harry Lustig]] notes his biographies that "Most of the world's great theoretical physicists... spent periods of their lives at Bohr's Institute."  Before the war, his research was instrumental in nuclear research, some of which led to the building of the bomb. During the war, however, Bohr was living in occupied Denmark and somewhat restricted in his research; he escaped to Sweden in 1943, just before an SS sweep which would have incriminated him through his Jewish heritage. In America, he worked in [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] on the atomic bomb until the end of the war. He died in 1962 and was survived by his wife, Margrethe.
*'''''Margrethe Bohr''''', known later in her life as ''Dronning'' or "Queen" Margrethe, was born in 1890 in [[Denmark]]. She was closely involved in her husband's work; he would commonly bounce ideas off of her, trying to explain them in "plain language." She died in 1984, survived by several of her children. Her son Hans wrote, "My mother was the natural and indispensable centre. Father knew how much mother meant to him and never missed an opportunity to show his gratitude and love.... Her opinions were his guidelines in daily affairs," and this relationship shows in Michael Frayn's dialogue.

==Genre==
''Copenhagen'' cannot be labelled simply as a comedy or [[tragedy]]; the lack of a protagonist and direct conflict prevents this in large part. David Rush explores a subgenre of theatre, a later hybrid form known as "drama," which he describes as a piece which cannot be specifically categorised as a tragedy, but which he notes involves "serious people going about serious business in a serious way." As the characters in ''Copenhagen'' are already dead, they cannot suffer any tragic fall; though there is definite wit in the arguments, it is taken in a very serious light seeing as it regards subjects like war, fear and nuclear arms. It is most nearly a "drama," but works in many ways as an expository piece in the manner it presents information to the audience.

==Style==
The construction of the plot is non-linear, seeing as it does not exist in time and space. Sometimes one character will not notice that there are other people in the space, and speak as if to no one. The world that Frayn presents is outside of our conceptions as audience members, simply by virtue of the fact that no one attending the play has ever died. So the world in which ''Copenhagen'' is based is somewhere between heaven and an atom.

It can also be thought to exist "inside the heads" of the characters present. It is a subjective world, taking and manipulating history, picking apart some events and mashing others together to better compare them. The characters are all plagued by some form of guilt or another, particularly in reference to the atomic bomb, and they are trapped in this world, doomed to forever speculate on that evening in Copenhagen in 1941 to determine how the world might have been changed. These are all traits of the artistic style known as [[Expressionism]].

In his preface to ''[[A Dream Play]]'', [[August Strindberg]] notes that in these worlds, "everything is possible and probable. Time and space do not exist. Working with... real events as a background, the imagination spins out its threads of thoughts and weaves them into new patterns." ''Copenhagen'' is an embodiment of these principles.

==Recurring images and motifs==
Because the concepts in physics and politics are at times very complicated or very abstract, Frayn uses several controlling images to better relate certain ideas to his audience.

‚Ä¢ ''Skiing'' and ''Table-Tennis'' ‚Äì These two activities are referred to as a pastime of Bohr and Heisenberg's, and both demonstrate the competition between the two (representative of national competition.) They are also used to suggest Heisenberg's speed and recklessness which contrasts with Bohr's caution and tediousness.

‚Ä¢ ''Invisible Straight'' ‚Äì An anecdote in which Bohr managed to bluff himself in a game of [[poker]] by betting on a [[List of poker hands#Straight|straight]] that he thought he had, but he really did not. This principle is applied to [[nuclear weaponry]], suggesting that nations will act differently when they think that an opponent can produce nuclear arms, whether or not the opponent can.

‚Ä¢ ''Cap-Pistols, Land Mines and Nuclear Reactors'' ‚Äì These fall into the Toy vs. Weapon theme and once again presents anecdotes of Bohr and Heisenberg's lives. Their fascination in playing with the new toy blinds them to the danger that it poses.

‚Ä¢ ''Bomb'' ‚Äì The term "bomb" appears as a literal looming image in many cases, but it is used figuratively in a couple of instances, as if it should be a joke, but with such grave implications that it cannot be found funny. (For example, Heisenberg refers to a "bomb having gone off" in Bohr's head.)

‚Ä¢ ''Christian Reaching for the Life-Buoy'' ‚Äì Christian was one of Bohr's sons, who tragically drowned while he and Bohr were out sailing. The phrase "Christian reaches for the life-buoy" appears several times during the play, and every time, the characters seem to hold their breath in the hope that this time, Christian will survive. Bohr had concluded that they would have both drowned had he jumped in to save his son, and this presents an idea of futile heroics, particularly with reference to Heisenberg and what should happen if he were to resist Hitler's rule.

‚Ä¢ ''"Another Draft"'' ‚Äì Whenever the characters conclude that an interpretation of their 1941 meeting is incorrect, they call for "another draft."

==Language==
Though the dialogue does not contradict logic, it cannot be called realistic in the strictest sense. One character's line might fade into the next, as though the second person knew exactly what he was going to say; sometimes a character will slip into a memory and partially relive a former or younger self in a monologue; and over the course of the show, there is a definite ambiguity as to whether they are speaking to one another or to the audience.

The play was originally written in English, but the real people in the exchange may have had this conversation in Danish or German. But even with translation in mind, Frayn defends that the words in the script are those that the characters would actually say. In his post-script, he writes, "If this needs any justification, I can only appeal to Heisenberg himself." Understandably, Frayn needs to present the characters in an interesting and dramatic light, as well as depicting a setting that no living person has visited, so the accuracy of such dialogue is subject to dwindle by degrees.

''Plain language'' and ''scientific language'' both operate in this play. There are several instances when the two physicists start speaking too scientifically for many people to understand, and one of them will remark that they must revert to plain language, to explain it in a way that Margrethe will understand. Even for this effort though, criticism arose about the complexity of the play and the difficulty for viewers to comprehend. A writer for ''[[The Commonweal]]'' commented on the Broadway premiere, saying that "the play's relentless cerebral forays can... be frustrating."

==Production history==
'''London Premiere''' ‚Äì 1998

''Copenhagen'' opened in the [[National Theatre in London]] and ran for more than 300 performances, starring David Burke as Niels Bohr, Sara Kestelman as Margrethe Bohr, and Matthew Marsh as Werner Heisenberg. It was directed by [[Michael Blakemore]].

"Copenhagen" transferred to the [[Duchess Theatre]] in [[London's West End]], where it ran from 8 February 1999, for more than 750 performances. It had a "second" cast when it opened in the [[West End theatre|West End]], who were responsible for performing at least one of the matinee shows each week. The second cast consisted of David Baron as Niels Bohr, Corinna Marlowe as Margarethe Bohr, and William Brand as Werner Heisenberg, and after six months, they replaced the original cast for the rest of the West End run.

'''Broadway Opening''' ‚Äì April 2000

Continuing under the direction of Michael Blakemore, it opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Royale Theatre]] on 11 April and ran for 326 performances. Starring [[Philip Bosco]] as Bohr, [[Michael Cumpsty]] as Heisenberg and [[Blair Brown]] as Margrethe, it went on to win the [[Tony Award for Best Play]], along with two others for [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play|Best Featured Actress in a Play]] (Blair Brown), and [[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play|Best Direction of a Play]] (Michael Blakemore). But even for its success, Frayn admitted in an article that "A number of commentators expressed misgivings about the whole enterprise." Several critics noted that it was heavy with scientific dialogue, a little too heavy for the common audience. Though a writer from ''[[Physics World]]'' hailed it as "brilliant theatre ," a Charles Spencer, of the ''Daily Telegraph'', wrote, "I felt that my brain was being stretched to breaking point‚Äîwell beyond breaking point, in fact."

'''TV Movie''' ‚Äì 2002

The play was adapted as a [[Copenhagen (TV film)|television movie]] in 2002, with [[Daniel Craig]] as Heisenberg, [[Stephen Rea]] as Niels Bohr, and [[Francesca Annis]] as Margrethe Bohr. The movie substantially cuts down the script of the play, eliminating several recurring themes, and most of the material that established the community of scientists in Copenhagen. It also abandons the abstract staging of the theatrical version in favour of being set in the city of Copenhagen, in Bohr's old house.

==Historical debate==
The meeting took place in September 1941 when Bohr and Heisenberg were 55 and 39, respectively. Heisenberg had worked with Bohr in [[Copenhagen]] for several years starting in 1924.

Heisenberg historians remain divided over their own interpretations of the event. Frayn's 1998 play brought more attention to what previously had been a primarily scholarly discussion. A collection of historical essays provoked by the play was published in English in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohst.berkeley.edu/publications/copenhagen/ |title=Michael Frayn's Copenhagen in Debate |publisher=Ohst.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the initial controversy stemmed from a 1956 letter Heisenberg sent to the journalist [[Robert Jungk]] after reading the German edition of Jungk's book, ''Brighter than a Thousand Suns'' (1956). In the letter, Heisenberg described how he had come to Copenhagen to discuss with Bohr his moral objections toward scientists working on nuclear weapons, but how he had failed to say this clearly before the conversation came to a halt. Jungk published an extract from the letter in the Danish edition of the book in 1956 which, out of context, made it look as if Heisenberg was claiming to have sabotaged the German bomb project on moral grounds. (The letter's whole text shows Heisenberg was careful not to claim this.)&lt;ref name="Werner-heisenberg.unh.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://werner-Heisenberg.unh.edu/Jungk.htm |title=Letter from Werner Heisenberg to Robert Jungk |publisher=Werner-heisenberg.unh.edu |date=17 November 1956 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bohr was outraged after reading this extract in his copy of the book, feeling that this was false and that the 1941 meeting had proven to him that Heisenberg was quite happy to produce nuclear weapons for Germany.

After the play inspired numerous scholarly and media debates over the 1941 meeting, the Niels Bohr Archive&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite web |url=http://www.nba.nbi.dk/ |title=Niels Bohr Archive |publisher=Niels Bohr Archive |date=February 2002 |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Copenhagen released to the public all sealed documents related to the meeting, a move intended mostly to settle historical arguments over what they contained.
Among the documents were the unsent letters Bohr drafted to Heisenberg in 1957 about Jungk's book and other topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbi.dk/NBA/papers/docs/d09tra.htm |title=Document 9. Translation |publisher=Nbi.dk |date= |accessdate=10 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210035340/http://www.nbi.dk/NBA/papers/docs/d09tra.htm |archivedate=10 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These drafts proved to be significant in several respects. First, they proved to be relatively consistent with Heisenberg's recollections of the meeting&lt;ref name="Werner-heisenberg.unh.edu"/&gt; given to Jungk in 1956, meaning that the course of the conversation can now be fairly well established. Bohr and Heisenberg agree that Heisenberg started the visit by stating to Bohr that nuclear weapons were now conceivable. As Heisenberg wrote to Jungk,
&lt;blockquote&gt;This talk probably started with my question as to whether or not it was right for physicists to devote themselves in wartime to the uranium problem ‚Äì as there was the possibility that progress in this sphere could lead to grave consequences in the technique of the war.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bohr confirms this by writing
&lt;blockquote&gt;It had to make a very strong impression on me that at the very outset you stated that you felt certain that the war, if it lasted sufficiently long, would be decided with atomic weapons.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heisenberg repeated his convictions on the technical feasibility of building nuclear weapons. As Heisenberg recalled: &lt;blockquote&gt;He [Bohr] replied as far as I can remember with a counter-question, "Do you really think that uranium fission could be utilized for the construction of weapons?"  I may have replied: "I know that this is in principle possible, but it would require a terrific technical effort, which, one can only hope, cannot be realized in this war."  Bohr was shocked by my reply. &lt;/blockquote&gt;  Bohr's draft letters are consistent with this: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I did not respond to this at all, but as you perhaps regarded this as an expression of doubt, you related how in the preceding years you had devoted yourself almost exclusively to the question and were quite certain that it could be done... &lt;/blockquote&gt;   
(This point is of interest, because it is at odds with the suggestion by critics that miscalculations by Heisenberg had led him to conclude erroneously, that atomic weapons were not feasible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Lawrence Rose|Rose, Paul Lawrence]] ''Heisenberg and the Nazi atomic bomb project: a study in German culture'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2000/oct/19/heisenberg-in-copenhagen/ Heisenberg in Copenhagen ],  Paul Lawrence Rose, reply by Thomas Powers, 19 October 2000, The New York Review of Books&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Bohr's later notes, Heisenberg then told Bohr that he had not come to discuss the technical aspects of the potential weapons:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Heisenberg said explicitly that he did not wish to enter into technical details but that Bohr should understand that he knew what he was talking about as he had spent 2 years working exclusively on this question.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unfortunately, because of Heisenberg's concerns about being monitored ‚Äì his discussion of any details of Germany's nuclear efforts with someone in an occupied country would have been illegal ‚Äì his remarks were cryptic. Indeed, Bohr's letters note that Heisenberg spoke "in vague terms", from which Bohr was only able to form an "impression" about Heisenberg's efforts.
Bohr wrote of this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I listened to this without speaking since [a] great matter for mankind was at issue in which, despite our personal friendship, we had to be regarded as representatives of two sides engaged in mortal combat. That my silence and gravity, as you write in the letter, could be taken as an expression of shock at your reports that it was possible to make an atomic bomb is a quite peculiar misunderstanding, which must be due to the great tension in your own mind. From the day three years earlier when I realized that slow neutrons could only cause fission in Uranium 235 and not 238, it was of course obvious to me that a bomb with certain effect could be produced by separating the uraniums. In June 1939 I had even given a public lecture in Birmingham about uranium fission, where I talked about the effects of such a bomb but of course added that the technical preparations would be so large that one did not know how soon they could be overcome. If anything in my behaviour could be interpreted as shock, it did not derive from such reports but rather from the news, as I had to understand it, that Germany was participating vigorously in a race to be the first with atomic weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbi.dk/NBA/papers/docs/d01tra.htm |title=Document 1. Translation |publisher=Nbi.dk |date= |accessdate=10 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222041908/http://www.nbi.dk/NBA/papers/docs/d01tra.htm |archivedate=22 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This circumspect discussion, combined with Bohr's shocked reaction to it, apparently cut off the discussion between the two. Thus, the Bohr letters cannot resolve the question, posed by the Copenhagen play, of what Heisenberg had tried to convey to Bohr.

Heisenberg's comment that he knew about the potential for weaponizing uranium fission, appears to counter the arguments of critics such as Rose  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2000/oct/19/heisenberg-in-copenhagen/&lt;/ref&gt; and Bernstein &lt;ref&gt;J. Bernstein, "Heisenberg and the Critical Mass," Am. J. Phys. 70, 911 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; that calculation errors in 1940 about feasibility, rather than moral scruples, led Heisenberg not to pursue building nuclear weapons.

Finally, the 1957 Bohr draft letters, written 16 years after the meeting, suggest a conflict between Bohr and Heisenberg. Heisenberg's letter to his wife, written on the eve of his departure from Copenhagen, provides no hint of a fracture. In it, he related his final evening with Bohr as very pleasant and unremarkable: "Today I was once more, with Weizs√§cker, at Bohr's. In many ways this was especially nice, the conversation revolved for a large part of the evening around purely human concerns, Bohr was reading aloud, I played a Mozart Sonata (a-Major)."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://werner-Heisenberg.unh.edu/copenhagen.htm |title=Copenhagen, Tuesday night ( September 1941 added in Elisabeth's handwriting) |publisher=Werner-heisenberg.unh.edu |date= |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2006 interview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jutarnji.hr/clanak/art-2006,3,19,supek_intervju,17440.jl?artpg=1 |title=Moj ≈æivot s nobelovcima 20. stoljeƒáa ‚Äì mJutarnji |publisher=Jutarnji.hr |date=18 March 2006 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivan Supek]], one of Heisenberg's students and friends, commented that "''Copenhagen'' is a bad play" and that "Frayn mixed up some things". Supek also claimed that [[Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker|Weizs√§cker]] was the main figure of the meeting. Allegedly, "Heisenberg and Weizs√§cker came to Bohr wearing German army uniforms. Weizs√§cker tried to persuade Bohr to mediate for peace between Great Britain and Germany and Heisenberg practically completely relied on his political judgement". Supek received these details in a confidential conversation with Margrethe who thought he would never make them public. Supek however felt it was "his duty to announce these facts so that future generations can know the truth about the Bohr ‚Äì Heisenberg meeting".

Supek's statements about Bohr's recollection of "the Bohr ‚Äì Heisenberg meeting" mixes up the visit. Because Heisenberg could only visit Bohr in occupied Denmark on behalf of the German government, Heisenberg was obliged to make public lectures on behalf of the Government which were monitored by German government officials. Heisenberg tried to convey his opinions later during private discussions with Bohr. Heisenberg's letters to his wife and later to Jungk place his conversation with Bohr on Wednesday evening.  Either he talked with Bohr on a walk, or at his residence. [3][7] Bohr, Supek, and Heisenberg describe the meeting differently&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.nbi.dk/papers/docs/d01tra.htm |title=Document 1.

A '''dying god''', or '''departure of the gods''', is a [[Motif (folkloristics)|motif]] in [[mythology]] in which one or more [[god]]s (of a [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]) die, are destroyed, or depart permanently from their place on Earth to elsewhere.

Frequently cited examples of dying gods are [[Balder]] in [[Norse mythology]], or [[Quetzalcoatl]] in [[Aztec mythology]]. A special subcategory is the death of an entire pantheon, the most notable example being [[Ragnar√∂k]] in Norse mythology, with other examples from Ireland, India, Hawaii and Tahiti.&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;

"Death or departure of the gods" is motif A192 in [[Stith Thompson]]'s '' Motif-Index of Folk-Literature'', with the following subcategories:&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;S. Thompson, ''Motif-index of folk-literature : a classification of narrative elements in folktales, ballads, myths, fables, medieval romances, exempla, fabliaux, jest-books, and local legends'',
Revised and enlarged. edition. Bloomington : Indiana University Press, 1955-1958, [[:wikisource:Page:Thompson_Motif-Index_2nd_1.djvu/106|p. 106]].&lt;/ref&gt;
:A192.1. Death of the gods (also F259.1. Mortality of fairies)
::A192.1.1. Old god slain by young god.   (also A525.2. [[Culture hero]] (god) slays his grandfather)
::A192.1.2. God killed and eaten (theophagy)
:A192.2. Departure of gods (also A560. Culture hero's (demi-god's) departure)
::A192.2.1. Deity [[Ascension (mystical)|departs for heaven (skies)]].

::A192.2.3. Divinity departs to submarine home. 
::A192.2.4. Divinity departs in column of flame. 
:A192.3. Expected return of deity. 
:A192.4. Divinity becomes mortal. 


A separate (although related and overlapping) category are gods who die and are also [[resurrection|resurrected]] (Thompson's motif A193), see [[Dying-and-rising god]].

{{merge to|Peaceful Revolution|date=March 2018}}
[[File:BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Berlin Wall at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], 10 November 1989]]
'''''{{lang|de|Die Wende}}''''' ({{IPA-de|diÀê Ààv…õnd…ô}}, "The Turn" or "The Turnaround") is a German term that has come to signify the complete process of change from the rule of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] and a centrally [[planned economy]] to the revival of [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[market economy]] in the German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany|GDR]]) around 1989 and 1990. It encompasses several processes and events which later have become synonymous with the overall process. These processes and events are:
*the [[Peaceful revolution (German)|Peaceful Revolution]] during the presidency of [[President of the Soviet Union]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], a time of massive protest and demonstrations ({{lang|de|[[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Montagsdemonstrationen]]}} ‚Äì "Monday demonstrations" and [[Alexanderplatz demonstration]]) against the political system of the GDR and for [[civil rights|civil]] and [[human rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geschichte der Bundesrepublik |url=https://www.hdg.de/lemo/kapitel/deutsche-einheit/friedliche-revolution.html |website=www.hdg.de |publisher=Stiftung Deutsches Historisches Museum |accessdate=29 June 2018 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; in late 1989.
*the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] on 9 November 1989 following a press conference held by the {{lang|de|[[Politb√ºro]]|italic=no}} during which [[G√ºnter Schabowski]] announced the introduction of unconditional travelling permissions, which was very unusual after four decades of severe travelling restrictions and intended to tone down the protesters but instead because of Schabowski's unclear and ambiguous wording led to an onrush of people willing to leave the country and the accidental opening of the border checkpoints at the same night.
* the transition to democracy in East Germany following the Peaceful Revolution, leading to [[East German general election, 1990|the only truly democratic elections]] to the {{lang|de|[[Volkskammer]]}} in the GDR on 18 March 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chronik der Wende | url=http://www.chronikderwende.de/_/english/overview_jsp.html | work= | publisher= | date= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*the process of [[German reunification]] leading to the {{lang|de|Einigungsvertrag}} (''Treaty of Unification'') on 31 August 1990, the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany]] on 12 September 1990 and finally the joining of the five re-established East German [[States of Germany|L√§nder]] to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]].

In hindsight, the [[German language|German]] word {{lang|de|Wende}} (meaning "The Turn") then took on a new meaning; the phrase ''{{lang|de|seit der Wende}}'', literally "since the change", means "since reunification" or "since the Wall fell". This period is marked by West German aid to East Germany, a total reaching an estimated $775 billion over 10 years. To some extent, Germany is still in the midst of the {{lang|de|Nachwendezeit}} (post-{{lang|de|Wende}} period): differences between East and West still exist, and a process of "[[inner reunification]]" is not yet finished.

This fundamental change has marked the reunification of [[Germany]]. The term was first used publicly in East Germany on 18 October 1989 in a speech by interim GDR leader [[Egon Krenz]] (the term having been used on the cover of influential West German news magazine {{lang|de|[[Der Spiegel]]}} two days previously).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Der Spiegel 42/1989 | url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/index-1989-42.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst it initially referred to the end of the old East German government, {{lang|de|die Wende}} has become synonymous with the fall of the Wall and of the East German state, and indeed of the entire [[Iron Curtain]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] [[state socialism]].

A '''flypast''' is a ceremonial or honorific flight by a group of aircraft or a single aircraft. The term ''flypast'' is used in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. In the [[United States]], the terms '''''flyover''''' and '''''flyby''''' are used.

Flypasts are often tied in with Royal or state events, anniversaries, celebrations - and occasionally funerary or memorial occasions.  Sometimes flypasts occur in special situations, to honour someone or to celebrate certain types of aircraft.  They have affinities with [[parade]]s, of which they form the aerial component. Often they occur in purely display contexts at [[airshows]], but it is the flypasts linked with civic, ceremonial and national pride, that imprint themselves on a nation's memory{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.   Some flypasts have been described in broadcast and print media as "historic".

Flypasts are regularly featured in public and ceremonial life in the United Kingdom, where they function as a particular kind of [[Salute#Aerial salutes|aerial salute]].  They serve to show respect, display aircraft, showcase flying skills and as a form of [[entertainment]] to delight the public, for example, during their annual appearance after  [[Trooping the Colour]]. Flypasts reflect milestones of national life; varying in scope from personal, to community and local, to military, to national. They may honour individuals in private or public life or commemorate happenings at a particular location.  They are also used to honour aircraft. On occasions both small and large they may occur over land or sea, sometimes connected with memorial or thanksgiving services.

In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, notably [[Singapore]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], they occur on national days and occasionally on anniversaries.  They are seen more rarely in other territories.

Flypast locations are usually of national importance.  In the UK, these include [[Buckingham Palace]], where the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] on the balcony will join the thousands of spectators in streets and parks below. Other [[London]] settings have included the [[River Thames]]. The 50th and 60th anniversaries of World War II were celebrated by flypasts over [[Normandy]] in [[France]].  Festivities of [[Trafalgar 200]] were centred over [[Portsmouth]] and at sea.

Settings have included the [[National Stadium, Singapore|National Stadium]], [[The Float@Marina Bay]] and the [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]] in [[Singapore]]; [[Rajpath]] in [[New Delhi]], India; Pakistan's Parliament House in [[Islamabad]]; Australia's [[Australian Parliament House|Parliament House]] and [[Anzac Parade, Canberra|Anzac Parade]] to the [[Australian War Memorial]], in [[Canberra, Australian Capital Territory|Canberra]]; [[Parliament Hill]], Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; and [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]].

==Early flypasts==
The connection of Trooping the Colour with Royal Air Force flypasts began in 1913 when the [[Royal Flying Corps]] Military [[Wing (air force unit)|Wing]] performed a flypast for [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] on Laffan's Plain, near Aldershot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mod.uk/ceremonialandheritage/household/trooping.htm History of Trooping the Colour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003095459/http://www.army.mod.uk/ceremonialandheritage/household/trooping.htm |date=3 October 2006 }} accessed 2 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 July 1935, George V carried out his [[Silver Jubilee]] Review of the [[Royal Air Force]] at [[RAF Duxford]] and [[RAF Mildenhall]] which included 200 aircraft on the ground and a flypast of 350 aircraft.

[[George VI|King George VI]] attended a flypast at the opening ceremony of the [[Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938]] at [[Ibrox Stadium]] on 5 May 1938, with his consort [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]].

==United Kingdom==
Flypasts are a regular occurrence in the United Kingdom at national events or commemorations. In 1954 the Queen conducted a Coronation Review of the Royal Air Force at [[RAF Odiham]] which included a flypast by about 640 aircraft  - among them 440 jet aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/british_military/1953.html Royal Air Force history, 1953]. Retrieved 30 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flypast -London, England-29April2011.jpg|right|thumb|Flypast of an [[Avro Lancaster]], a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and a [[Hawker Hurricane]] over [[Buckingham Palace]] on 29 April 2011, after the wedding ceremony of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]]]]

On many occasions, the flypasts are performed by the [[Red Arrows]] aerobatic team of the [[Royal Air Force]], but on more important events like Royal occasions, for example the Queen's 80th birthday during 2006, was a flypast following the [[Trooping the Colour]].  Headed by the Lancaster with 2 Hurricanes and 2 Spitfires ([[Battle of Britain Memorial Flight]]), the 49 aircraft in 9 formations included Typhoons, Jaguars, Tristar, VC10, C-17A Globemaster III and E-3 Sentry.  The highlight was a "Diamond 9" formation of Tornado GR4s and the appearance of a [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] escorted by the Red Arrows.

Historic aircraft of the [[Battle of Britain Memorial Flight]], including [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s and the [[Avro Lancaster]] perform flypasts throughout the year particularly on military anniversaries and occasions and as a mark of respect at funerals and memorial services.

==National or Republic Day celebrations==

In many countries, flypasts, normally performed by the precision aerobatic team of a country's [[air force]], are an integral part of [[Republic Day]] or [[National Day]] celebrations.

On [[Canada Day]] 1 July, the [[Snowbirds]] of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] perform a flyby over [[Parliament Hill]] in Ottawa.  In 2017, this flypast was extended to 39 aircraft to mark [[Canada]]'s 150th birthday.

The [[Pakistan Air Force]] conducts a flypast every year on 23 March to commemorate the [[Lahore Declaration]] and the [[Republic Day (Pakistan)|Republic Day]] of [[Pakistan]] which occurred on 23 March 1956. This is done in [[Islamabad]].

In [[Singapore]] the National Day Parade on 9 August 2005 celebrated 40 years of independence with an elaborate flypast &lt;ref&gt;For the full configuration, see [[National Day Parade, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;
including two [[Chinook helicopter]]s  [https://www.flickr.com/photos/thesingaporeidler/62377386/ flying the national flag past the Esplanade Theatre] in Padang.

In [[Finland]], during Independence Day parade on 6 December the [[Finnish Air Force]] has traditionally performed a flyover of four fighters at the moment when the honour company of the Air force passes the podium where a representative of the war veterans, a representative of the city  and the commander of the military province in question receive the parade troops marching past, the Helicopter battalion of [[Utti Jaeger Regiment]] has also performed flyovers timed to happen at the same time when the honour company of the [[Finnish Army]] provided by the Utti Jaeger Regiment passes the podium.

In [[India]], [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]] celebrations on 26 January includes a flypast in Delhi.

In the [[Philippines]], flypasts (also called flybys) by [[Philippine Air Force]] are held to celebrate [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Independence Day]] on 12 June and [[Rizal Day]] on 30 December.

On 1 April 2008, a flypast by the [[Red Arrows]] over Central London marked the 90th Anniversary of the founding of the [[Royal Air Force]].  The milestone was also celebrated that June following [[Trooping the Colour]] 2008 with a flypast of 55 aircraft, and in July with a Royal Review and flypast of 90 aircraft at the [[Royal International Air Tattoo]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/7324754.stm  flypast]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Ten years later, the RAF's centenary was celebrated over [[The Mall, London]] and [[Buckingham Palace]] on 10 July 2018 with a large-scale flypast featuring the Red Arrows, the [[Battle of Britain Memorial Flight]], and aircraft from several RAF squadrons.  This flypast featured 103 aircraft of 24 different types, spread out over twenty different formations. The entire flypast took nine minutes to pass over London.  This was also the RAF's longest ever flypast: line of aircraft stretching over 100 miles long and featuring aircraft based from 17 different airfields all over the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.raf.mod.uk/raf100/news/london-s-week-of-raf100-events/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forces.net/news/raf-100-iconic-aircraft-line-rare-london-flypast/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.military-airshows.co.uk/press18/raf100flypast2018.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

During October 2006, the [[Indian Air Force]] celebrated its [[Platinum Jubilee]] with a flypast of around 78 aircraft, including the [[Sukhoi Su-30|Sukhoi 30 MKI]], the [[Mirage 2000]], and [[MiG-25]] attack aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.msn.co.in/News/National/NewsNDTV_081006_1144.htm ''MSN News'', "IAF marks 75th year with impressive flypast" October 8, 2006]  Accessed 15 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
Anniversaries of World War II, such as [[VJ Day]], have also been celebrated with flypasts in other countries, notably Australia and Canada and over the Normandy beaches.

Achievements of the [[Royal Air Force]] in [[World War II]] were celebrated at the time and continue to be commemorated in flypasts.  The upper dams of [[Ladybower Reservoir]] were used to practise for the [https://web.archive.org/web/20051109014431/http://simscience.org/cracks/dambusters.html Dambusters] raids and this is occasionally commemorated in flypasts by the [[Battle of Britain Memorial Flight]].

On 15 September 1945, after the war ended, about 300 aircraft flew over London in the first [[Battle of Britain]] anniversary flypast. "The formation was led by 247 Squadron in their new [[de Havilland Vampire|Vampire]] fighters, the first time the public had seen the aircraft."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/line1945-49.html Royal Air Force history timeline]. Retrieved 30 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  This flypast was apparently led by [[Douglas Bader]] (RAF hero commemorated and portrayed by [[Kenneth More]] in the film ''Reach For the Sky.'')

An attender recalls a victory parade in London on 8 June 1946 featuring [http://www.pprune.org/forums/showthread.php?t=55860 two flypasts], one during the day and one at night.  Scores of aircraft, of many kinds, took part.

The 50th and 60th anniversaries of World War II were commemorated with large flypasts. On 15 September 1990, 168 aircraft in seven formations celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the [[Battle of Britain]]. Further flypasts occurred on 6 June 1994, celebrating the 50th anniversary of [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]].

Over the weekend of 19‚Äì20 August 1995, the 50th anniversary of [[VJ Day]] was marked in London, including "a two-minute silence which...was ended by an Avro Lancaster bomber overflying The Mall and dropping about a million [[Remembrance poppy|poppies]] over the site." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/mod/defence/c2p4.htm Lancaster bomber overflying The Mall]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the evening, there was a further flypast on the [[Thames]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/mod/defence/c2tx1.htm#p2 World War Two commemorations] description from the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence.

6 June 2004 marked the 60th Anniversary of D-day, with the [[Normandy landings]] commemorated by veterans (many now aged 80+ years) and political leaders at locations throughout Normandy. The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight scattered millions of poppies over the veterans as they crossed the [[English Channel]] by [[ferry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raf.mod.uk/news/archive/2004/limage_dday60.html commemorations of 60th anniversary of D-day on RAF website]&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, it [http://www.raf.mod.uk/news/archive/2004/images/limage_dday60_05.jpg  flew over the veterans] at [[Arromanches]], concluding a memorial service with a 47-aircraft flypast of modern military jets led by the RAF Red Arrows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1166&amp;id=646022004 ''The Scotsman'', Monday 7 June 2004].

Flypasts also demonstrate national pride at landmark entertainment and sporting events.

* '''Canada''', the [[Snowbirds]] perform a flypast after the national anthem [[O Canada]] at each annual [[Grey Cup]] event, which is the largest sporting event in Canada.
* '''Italy''' Among the celebrations in  of the [[Football World Cup]] victory in 2006 was a flypast by the [[Frecce Tricolori]] at [[Pratica di Mare Air Force Base|Pratica di Mare]], streaming the red, green, and white  of the Italian flag.
* '''United States''', flyovers are common at professional sports and racing events as part of the performance of [[The Star-Spangled Banner]].&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/6544/how-flyovers-hit-their-exact-marks-at-games&lt;/ref&gt;  The flyover had been a strong [[NASCAR]] tradition, as every major race features one, usually performed by an air force or air national guard wing based in the area, and in some cases naval and marine air units. Army helicopters have also occasionally performed them. It is also a staple of the national anthem at the NFL [[Super Bowl]], MLB [[World Series]] games and the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. A flyover occurs at the beginning of the Men's Final of the US Open Tennis Championships. This is usually performed by the [[Blue Angels]], the official U.S. Navy aerobatics demonstration squadron. A flyby takes places prior to the start of the [[Indianapolis 500]] mile race, the largest single-day sporting event in the world. In most racing events in [[NASCAR]], flyovers are held, especially at the Daytona 500. Held annually on [[Memorial Day]] weekend, U.S. military aircraft perform a flyby while "[[Taps]]" is played in remembrance of Memorial Day. In some years, multiple aircraft participate, executing the [[missing man formation]].

==Entertainment==

'''[[New Zealand]]''' showed its pride at being the [[Filming location|location]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', at the [[premiere]] in [[Wellington]] of the third film in the [[trilogy]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''.

==Memorials==
The funeral of Italian tenor [[Luciano Pavarotti]] was sealed by a flypast from [[Frecce Tricolori]] over [[Modena Cathedral]], his native town, on 8 September 2007. Tens of thousands of people who had filed past his coffin as it lay in state, witnessed the show of respect and mourning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/6985148.stm flypast (image no. 11 in this BBC photographic gallery)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLn-irVEe6k&amp;feature=related Funerali Pavarotti: l'ultimo saluto dalle Frecce Tricolori ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accidents and incidents==

Some [[Canberra]] residents panicked during a flypast in 2003 over Parliament House by two [[F-111]] jets, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Australian High Court.  It manifested itself as "two thunderously loud balls of flame screaming overhead at a height of about 300 metres and heading toward the city's landmarks."

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Listed as 1983 TB--&gt; which is thought to be a [[Pallas family|Palladian asteroid]]&lt;ref name="NG2010"/&gt; with a "[[rock&amp;nbsp;comet]]" orbit.&lt;ref name=Jewitt2010/&gt; This would make the Geminids, together with the [[Quadrantids]], the only major meteor showers not originating from a [[comet]]. The [[meteor]]s from this shower are slow moving, can be seen in December and usually peak around December 13‚Äì14, with the date of highest intensity being the morning of December 14. The shower is thought to be intensifying every year and recent showers have seen 120‚Äì160 meteors per hour under optimal conditions, generally around 02:00 to 03:00 local time. Geminids were first observed in 1862,&lt;ref name="Kronk"/&gt; much more recently than other showers such as the [[Perseids]] (36 AD) and [[Leonids]] (902 AD).

The meteors in this shower appear to come from a [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] in the constellation [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]] (hence the shower's name). However, they can appear almost anywhere in the night sky, and often appear yellowish in hue. Well north of the equator, the radiant rises about sunset, reaching a usable elevation from the local evening hours onwards. In the southern hemisphere, the radiant appears only around local midnight or so. Observers in the northern hemisphere will see higher Geminid rates as the radiant is higher in the sky.&lt;ref name="Meteorwatch2"/&gt; The meteors travel at medium speed in relation to other showers, at about {{convert|22|mi/s|km/s}}, making them fairly easy to spot. The Geminids are now considered by many to be the most consistent and active annual shower. Geminids disintegrate while at heights above {{convert|24|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="Meteorwatch"/&gt;

[[File:Gijsbrecht van Aemstel titelblad (1893) Antoon Derkinderen.jpg|thumb|Gijsbrecht van Aemstel (1893 ed.)]]
'''''Gijsbrecht van Aemstel''''' ({{IPA-nl|Àà…£…õizbr…õxt f…ën Àà…ëmst…ôl}})&lt;ref&gt;In isolation, ''van'' is pronounced {{IPA-nl|v…ën|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a 17th-century [[history play]] by [[Joost van den Vondel]], written to inaugurate [[Amsterdam]]'s [[Schouwberg of Van Campen|first city theatre]].  The first production was planned to take place on 26 December 1637, but was postponed until 3 January 1638.  The piece was then performed annually (on [[New Year's Day]]) in Amsterdam until 1968.

==Plot==
Set in 1304, it tells the story of the siege of [[Amsterdam]] and its surrounding towns, united by the [[Kennemer]]s and [[Waterlander]]s. The reason for the siege is Gijsbrecht's alleged involvement in the abduction and manslaughter of [[Floris V]] in 1296.

The enemy soldiers appear to leave but smuggle themselves into the town, hidden in a cargo of firewood being shipped in by the citizens of Amsterdam. After a violent battle, Gijsbrecht is forced to flee to Prussia, to found a "New Holland" there.

==Historical accuracy==
In reality, the nobleman who in 1304 invaded Amsterdam (to recover his position and possessions lost in 1296) was not [[Gijsbrecht IV]] (1235‚Äì1303), but his son [[Jan I of Amstel|Jan I]] (1270‚Äì1345).

Historian [[Pim de Boer]] at the [[University of Groningen]] has found serious (though not entirely conclusive) indications that Gijsbrecht - after his exile, with a few followers - founded [[Pas≈Çƒôk|Pruissisch Holland]] (now in Poland), not far from [[Elbing]] (also now in Poland).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Parodies==
Various parodies and continuations of the play have been produced by other authors, including the musical ''The Angel of Amsterdam'' (''De Engel van Amsterdam'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16265">There are a number of meanings for the term [[humanitarian]].  Here humanitarian pertains to the practice of saving lives and alleviating [[suffering]].  It is usually related to emergency response (also called humanitarian response) whether in the case of a natural disaster or a man-made disaster such as war or other armed conflict.  '''Humanitarian principles''' govern the way humanitarian response is carried out.

==Core humanitarian principles==

===Humanity===
The principle of humanity means that all humankind shall be treated humanely and equally in all circumstances by saving lives and alleviating suffering, while ensuring respect for the individual. It is the fundamental principle of humanitarian response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/EA08067453343B76C1256D2600383BC4?OpenDocument&amp;Style=Custo_Final.3&amp;View=defaultBody3  Pictet (1979) Humanity]. [[Jean Pictet|Pictet's]] commentary is focused on the Red Cross use of the principle of humanity, but includes more general comments relevant to the whole humanitarian sector.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarian Imperative===
The [[Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief]] (RC/NGO Code) introduces the concept of the humanitarian imperative which expands the principle of humanity to include the right to receive and to give humanitarian assistance.  It states the obligation of the international community "to provide humanitarian assistance wherever it is needed."&lt;ref&gt;For a critical view see: Hugo Slim, "Relief agencies and moral standing in war: principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and solidarity, Development in Practice, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4/August 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impartiality===
Provision of [[humanitarian assistance]] must be [[impartiality|impartial]] and not based on nationality, race, religion, or political point of view.  It must be based on need alone.

For most non-governmental humanitarian agencies (NGHAs), the principle of impartiality is unambiguous even if it is sometimes difficult to apply, especially in rapidly changing situations. However, it is no longer clear which organizations can claim to be humanitarian. For example, companies like PADCO, a USAID subcontractor, is sometimes seen as a humanitarian NGO.  However, for the UN agencies, particularly where the UN is involved in peace keeping activities as the result of a Security Council resolution, it is not clear if the UN is in position to act in an impartial manner if one of the parties is in violation of terms of the UN Charter.&lt;ref&gt;(See:  [[Report of the Panel on United Nations Peacekeeping]] (Brahimi report)pp. ix &amp; 9){{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/peace/reports/peace_operations/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114055129/http://www.un.org/peace/reports/peace_operations/ |archivedate=November 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence===
Humanitarian agencies must formulate and implement their own policies independently of government policies or actions.

Problems may arise because most NGHAs rely in varying degrees on government donors.  Thus for some organizations it is difficult to maintain independence from their donors and not be confused in the field with governments who may be involved in the hostilities.  The [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]], has set the example for maintaining its independence (and neutrality) by raising its funds from governments  through the use of separate annual appeals for headquarters costs and field operations.&lt;ref&gt;(see: [http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine1996_3/18-19.html Joanna Macrae: NGOs: Has the 'N' gone missing?] [http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine1998_2/2-7.html Randolph Kent: Footing the aid bill])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defining principles===
The core principles are defining characteristics, the necessary conditions for humanitarian response.  Organizations such as military forces and for-profit companies may deliver assistance to communities affected by disaster in order to save lives and alleviate suffering, but they are not considered by the humanitarian sector as humanitarian agencies as their response is not based on the core principles.

==Additional humanitarian principles==
In addition to the core principles, there are other principles that govern humanitarian response for specific types of humanitarian agencies such as UN agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and NGOs.

===Neutrality===
The [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] follows, in addition to the above core principles, the principle of neutrality.  For the Red Cross, neutrality means not to take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.

The principle of neutrality was specifically addressed to the Red Cross Movement to prevent it from not only taking sides in a conflict, but not to "engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature."  The principle of neutrality was left out of the Red Cross/NGO code because some of the NGHAs, while committed to giving impartial assistance, were not ready to forgo their lobbying on justice issues related to political and ideological questions.

United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/582/70/IMG/NR058270.pdf?OpenElement United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; lists the principle of neutrality, alongside the principles of humanity and impartiality in its annex as a guide to the provision of humanitarian assistance.  The resolution is designed to strengthen human response of the UN system, and it clearly applies to the UN agencies.

[[neutrality (international relations)|Neutrality]] can also apply to humanitarian actions of a state.  "Neutrality remains closely linked with the definition which introduced the concept into international law to designate the status of a State which decided to stand apart from an armed conflict. Consequently, its applications under positive law still depend on the criteria of abstention and impartiality which have characterized neutrality from the outset."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JN2Z|title=International Committee of the Red Cross|date=3 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of the word neutrality to humanitarian aid delivered by UN agencies or even governments can be confusing.  GA Resolution 46/182 proclaims the principle of neutrality, yet as an inter-governmental political organization, the UN is often engaged in controversies of a political nature.  According to this interpretation, the UN agency or a government can provide neutral humanitarian aid as long as it does it impartially, based upon need alone.&lt;ref&gt;(For a discussion of the concept of neutrality with respect to humanitarian response see: [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JN2Z Denise Plattner])&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the word neutrality is widely used within the humanitarian community, usually to mean the provision of humanitarian aid in an impartial and independent manner, based on need alone.  Few international NGOs have curtailed work on justice or human rights issues because of their commitment to neutrality.

===Proselytism===
The provision of aid must not exploit the vulnerability of victims and be used to further political or religious creeds.  All of the major non-governmental humanitarian agencies (NGHAs) by signing up to the RC/NGO Code of Conduct have committed themselves not to use humanitarian response to further political or religious creeds.

==Principles based on field experience in emergencies==
All of the above principles are important requirements for  effective field operations.  They are based on widespread field experience of agencies engaged in humanitarian response.  In conflict situations, their breach may drastically affect the ability of agencies to respond to the needs of the victims.

If a warring party believes, for example, that an agency is favoring the other side, or that it is an agent of the enemy, access to the victims may be blocked and the lives of humanitarian workers may be put in danger.  If one of the parties perceives that an agency is trying to spread another religious faith, there may be a hostile reaction to their activities.

==Sources==
The core principles, found in the [[Red Cross/NGO Code of Conduct]] and in GA Resolution 46/182&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/46/182|title=A/RES/46/182 - E|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; are derived from the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross, particularly principles I (humanity), II (impartiality), III (neutrality‚Äîin the case of the UN), and IV (independence).&lt;ref&gt;(For a discussion of their background and a commentary on the principles see: [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/5mje9n Jean Pictet 1979])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humanitarian accountability ==
Accountability has been defined as: "the processes through which an organisation makes a 
commitment to respond to and balance the needs of stakeholders in its decision making processes and activities, and delivers against this commitment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lloyd, Robert M. |author2=Monica Blagescu |author3=Lucy de las Casas |title=Pathways to Accountability: The Gap Framework |publisher=One World Trust |location= |year=2005 |pages= 5|isbn=0-9504434-6-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|url=dtrust.org/documents/Pathways_to_Accountability,_A_Short_Guide_to_the_GAP_Framework.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]] adds: "Accountability is about using power responsibly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hapinternational.org/other/faq.aspx#top|title=HAPI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 9 of the [[Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief]] states:
"We hold ourselves accountable to both those we seek to assist and those from whom we accept resources;" and thus identifies the two major stake holders: donors and beneficiaries.  However, traditionally humanitarian agencies have tended to practice mainly "upward accountability", i.e. to their donors.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Anderson: {{cite web |url=http://programs.ssrc.org/emergencies/publications/Anderson.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201180533/http://programs.ssrc.org/emergencies/publications/Anderson.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }} p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of many humanitarian agencies during the Rwandan Genocide, led to a number of initiatives designed to improve humanitarian assistance and accountability, particularly with respect to the beneficiaries.  Examples include the [[Sphere Project]], [[ALNAP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alnap.org/|title=ALNAP - Home|website=www.alnap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103064539/http://www.compasqualite.org/en/index/index.php|title=Quality COMPAS - Homepage|date=3 November 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[People In Aid]] Code of Good Practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peopleinaid.org/code/|title=Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]], which runs a "global quality insurance scheme for humanitarian agencies."

==Additional principles==
The RC/NGO Code also lists a number of more aspirational principles which are derived from experience  with development assistance.
*Agencies should operate with respect to culture and custom
*Humanitarian response should use local resources and capacities as much as possible
*The participation of the beneficiaries should be encouraged
*Emergency response should strive to reduce future vulnerabilities
*Agencies should be accountable to both donors and beneficiaries
*Humanitarian agencies should use information activities to portray victims as dignified human beings, not hopeless objects

==The right to life with dignity==
The Sphere Project Humanitarian Charter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang,English/ Sphere Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229181547/http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84/lang,English/ |date=2006-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the language of human rights to remind that the [[right to life]] which is proclaimed in both the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Convention on Civil and Political Rights]] is related to [[human dignity]].

==Vulnerability and behavioral issues==
Humanitarian principles are mainly focused on the behavior of organizations.  However a humane response implies that humanitarian workers are not to take advantage of the [[social vulnerability|vulnerabilities]] of those affected by war and violence.  Agencies have the responsibility for developing rules of staff conduct which prevent abuse of the beneficiaries.

===Sexual exploitation and abuse===
One of the most problematic areas is related to the issue of [[Sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian response|sexual exploitation and abuse]] of beneficiaries by humanitarian workers.  In an emergency where victims have lost everything, women and girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual abuse.

A number of reports which identified the sexual exploitation of refugees in west Africa prodded the humanitarian community to work together in examining the problem and to take measures to prevent abuses.  In July 2002, the UN's Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) adopted a plan of action which stated: Sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers constitute acts of gross misconduct and are therefore grounds for termination of employment.  The plan explicitly prohibited the "Exchange of money, employment, goods, or services for sex, including sexual favours or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour."  The major NGHAs as well the UN agencies engaged in humanitarian response committed themselves to setting up internal structures to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;(See:[http://ochaonline.un.org/webpage.asp?Site=sexex IASC, Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120184234/http://ochaonline.un.org/webpage.asp?Site=sexex |date=2006-11-20 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance==
Substantial efforts have been made in the humanitarian sector to monitor compliance with humanitarian principles. Such efforts include The [[People In Aid#The People In Aid Code of Good Practice|People In Aid Code of Good Practice]], an internationally recognised management tool that helps humanitarian and development organisations enhance the quality of their human resources management. The NGO, [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]], is also working to make humanitarian organizations more accountable, especially to the beneficiaries.

Structures internal to the Red Cross Movement monitor compliance to the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross.

The RC/NGO Code is self-enforcing. The [[SCHR]] carries out peer reviews among its members which look in part at the issue of compliance with principles set out in the RC/NGO Code

'''Marta Simlat''', known as '''J.K.''' (born 2 January 1970) is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Model (person)|model]] and [[eurodance]] "singer" who enjoyed moderate success in the mid- to late-1990s with the Italian producers [[Larry Pignagnoli]] and [[Davide Riva]].

==Musical career==
Simlat moved from [[Poland]] to [[Italy]] in 1992 to pursue a modelling career. However, shortly after her move she was spotted by [[Larry Pignagnoli]] and Davide Riva, the production team behind [[Whigfield]]. Simlat was quickly signed to and her first single, "You Make Me Feel Good", performed well in [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Germany]] and topped the dance charts in [[Canada]].

Her third single, "[[You and I (J.K. song)|You and I]]", climbed to the top position on the Canadian dance charts and obtained strong airplay in continental Europe. The track was also used on many dance compilation albums around the globe, including [[Muchmusic]]'s ''Dance Mix '95'' and the ''Eurodisco '96 - Collection''. A fourth single, "My Radio", took Europe by storm{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} and also became popular in [[Japan]].

Although J.K.'s last official single, "Deep in the Night", was released in 1999, the [[Benassi Bros]] made two cover versions of J.K. songs with the vocalist [[Dhany]] in 2005 titled "[[Pumphonia|Hit My Heart]]" and "[[‚Ä¶Phobia|Make Me Feel]]". Most singles were only released in Italy.

In reality, the vocals for J.K. were performed by [[Jenny B|Giovanna Bersola]], [[Sandy Chambers]] and [[Zeitia Massiah]] on all the songs. [[Lip-sync]] was performed on videos and live performances by Simlat. It was proven that Simlat was actually lip-syncing when she forgot to turn her microphone off during the beginning of "My Radio (70's)" on Dance Machine 9. Her real voice was revealed, which was not the one behind the performance of the songs. After her last official single, "You Got Me Dancing" in 2000, Simlat disappeared from the public eye and left the J.K. project (probably due to the proven [[lipsync]] allegations) leaving J.K. in the void.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Captain '''John Herbert Hedley''' (19 July 1887 ‚Äì 1 April 1977) was a [[World War I]] British [[flying ace]] credited with eleven aerial victories. The observer ace claimed to have survived a bizarre flying mishap which earned him the moniker "The Luckiest Man Alive." Hedley also survived uninjured after his plane was shot down in 1918, and he became a prisoner of war. After his immigration to the United States in 1920, he became a regular on the lecture circuit, enthralling American audiences with the stories of his military service.

There is some disagreement among a variety of sources with regard to the details of John Hedley's military career. Hedley indicated that he joined the British Army on 4 August 1914.&lt;ref name=iowa&gt;{{cite web|title=Captain J. H.

The aviator was given the nickname "The Luckiest Man Alive" by [[Floyd Gibbons]], ''Chicago Tribune'' war correspondent during World War I.&lt;ref name=rockford&gt;{{cite news|title=British Pilot Tells War Yarn To Rotary Club|newspaper=The Rockford Register-Gazette|date=27 December 1928|location=Rockford, Illinois|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=illinois&gt;{{cite news|title=British War Ace Will Talk Here on Friday|newspaper=The Rockford Register-Gazette|date=23 April 1929|location=Rockford, Illinois|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=strange&gt;{{cite book|title=Strange But True, America: Weird Tales from All 50 States|publisher=John Hafnor|isbn= 9780964817555|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZBXEPUu7EQC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=John+Hedley,+ace&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UPJT9uxhke&amp;sig=AMZZMZO91Eh6Pd5prXatoyLCR0g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hRaCT-XZFoKS9gTO8r3tBw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Hedley%2C%20ace&amp;f=false|author=John Hafnor|edition=Illustrated|accessdate=8 April 2012|page=40|date=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Hedley claimed that while in aerial combat with German fighters in early 1918, his pilot [[Reginald Makepeace|Reginald "Jimmy" Makepeace]] put their plane into an abrupt nosedive, and Hedley tumbled out of the aircraft. The pilot continued his rapid descent for several hundred feet. However, when the plane pulled up, the ejected observer Hedley purportedly grabbed the tail and climbed back into his seat.&lt;ref name=iowa/&gt;&lt;ref name=milwaukee&gt;{{cite news|title=Falls From Plane Three Miles Up‚Äîand Still Lives|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19300327&amp;id=pGVQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8Q4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4274,4836593|accessdate=11 April 2012|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=27 March 1930|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought that Hedley had been caught in the slipstream of the plane and had been brought down at the same velocity as the aircraft.&lt;ref name=milwaukee/&gt; The shaken pilot and observer then returned safely to their base.&lt;ref name=strange/&gt;

On 27 March 1918, Captains John Herbert Hedley and [[Robert Kirby Kirkman]] in Bristol F.2b (B1156) were shot down by Leutnant [[Karl Gallwitz]] of [[Jasta 2]]. Both survived the crash without injuries and were captured. For many years, it was mistakenly thought that Hedley and Kirkman had been taken down by none other than [[Manfred von Richthofen]] himself.&lt;ref name=above/&gt;&lt;ref name=strange/&gt; On 12 March 1918, Hedley was recommended for four aircraft destroyed, four aircraft sent out of control, and one [[Observation balloon|balloon]] deflated. He received the [[Croix de guerre|French Croix de Guerre]], gazetted on 28 April 1918.&lt;ref name=above/&gt; Hedley indicated that he also received the Belgian Croix de Guerre.&lt;ref name=milwaukee/&gt; Captain Hedley spent most of the rest of the year in a German prisoner of war camp, and was repatriated from Germany on 13 December 1918.&lt;ref name=above/&gt;

Instead, Makepeace is listed for victories 3 and 4, and Kirkman for Victories 7, 8, and 9.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; In addition, after the war, John Hedley indicated that he had scored thirteen aerial victories, twelve planes and one balloon.&lt;ref name=illinois/&gt;

==After the war==
[[Image:John Herbert Hedley brochure.png|thumb|right|Promotional material for John Herbert Hedley's lecture "Rambling Through the Air."]]
After Captain Hedley's return to England, his second son, Sidney Roland Hedley, was born in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hedley|first=Sidney R|title=England &amp; Wales, Birth Index: 1916‚Äì2005|work=ancestry.com|publisher=England and Wales Civil Registration Indexes.

His wife and children immigrated the following year, arriving in New York on 22 August 1921. They resided on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook]], Illinois, where John Herbert Hedley, Sr. was naturalised on 3 May 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hedley|first=John Herbert|title=U.S. Naturalization Record Indexes, 1791‚Äì1992|work=ancestry.com|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hedley|title=New York Passenger Lists, 1820‚Äì1957|work=ancestry.com|publisher=Passenger Lists of Vessels Arriving at New York City, 1897‚Äì1957.

John Hedley apparently was very successful on the lecture circuit in 1920s and early 1930s, regaling American crowds with the story of his near-death experiences in (and out) of the cockpit that had earned him his nickname, "The Luckiest Man Alive."&lt;ref name=iowa/&gt;&lt;ref name=strange/&gt;&lt;ref name=milwaukee/&gt; The lecture that the former observer ace gave on a number of occasions was entitled ''Rambling Through the Air''.&lt;ref name=iowa/&gt; It appears that the talks took place most frequently between 1928 and 1930, often in Illinois,&lt;ref name=rockford/&gt;&lt;ref name=illinois/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British Flier to Tell Rotary of Air Exploits|newspaper=The Rockford Register-Gazette|date=26 December 1928|location=Rockford, Illinois|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Noted War Ace Sycamore Club Guest Sunday|newspaper=Rockford Republic|date=13 December 1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Varsity Club Hears Noted Flying Ace|newspaper=Rockford Republic|date=23 April 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also in other states such as Indiana and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name=iowa/&gt;&lt;ref name=milwaukee/&gt; Hedley thrilled a variety of audiences as he recounted his military experiences, from his initial service with the British Army in 1914 to his time as a prisoner of war until late 1918. The highlight of his lecture was almost always his account of being thrown out of the plane three miles above the earth, falling two or three hundred feet, and landing back on the tail of his aircraft.&lt;ref name=iowa/&gt; However, in one newspaper account, there is the suggestion that his version of the account differed. The journalist indicated that Hedley had "retained his grasp on the macine (''sic'') gun."&lt;ref name=rockford/&gt; The aviator claimed to have fought Richthofen's Circus three times, as a member of the 20th Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps, with the final encounter resulting in his aircraft being shot down in flames by [[Manfred von Richthofen]].&lt;ref name=iowa/&gt;&lt;ref name=illinois/&gt; Press reviews of his lectures were rather complimentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Capt.

[[File:Rupert Murdoch - WEF Davos 2007.jpg|thumb|Rupert Murdoch ‚Äì World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2007]]

"'''Journalism and Freedom'''" was an article by [[Rupert Murdoch]] that appeared in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' 's online ''Opinion Journal'' on 8 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, R. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704107104574570191223415268?mod=WSJ_hps_sections_opinion#articleTabs%3Darticle ''Article in Wall Street Journal''], 8 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Journalism and Freedom" was adapted from a speech given by Murdoch  (Chairman and CEO of [[News Corporation]]) at the [[Federal Trade Commission]]'s Workshop on Journalism and the Internet, held on 1 December 2009. In this article Murdoch discusses his views on government involvement in the press in the form of subsidies, the outdated "20th century business models" of newspapers which rely on advertising revenues and the detrimental effects these have on creators of established news content and the newspaper industry as a whole. He also argues that government funding compromises independent journalism and is a greater threat to competitive and unbiased press than digital technologies are.  Also discussed is the impact of internet search engines and open content news material available online and new methods and models of content delivery portal electronic devices and media (e-readers, smart phones, laptops) and how this will affect delivery of news content in the future.

The debate surrounding "Journalism and Freedom" has focused on the threat of new technologies, and the role that they play in the decline of traditional newspapers. Murdoch does not blame new technologies for the [[decline of newspapers]], rather the lack of regulation which allows journalists content to be used without payment.  He sees the opportunities technologies can bring, creating a much wider audience for newspapers. Opinions have also been voiced concerning government interventions and the suitability of these as a way of rescuing the industry. Other revenue and business models have been proposed as an alternative to existing ones, as traditional models are failing.

==Decline of the industry==
A report in 2009 highlighted the decline of newspaper circulation as figures showed that the industry as a whole sold fewer newspapers than at any other time since the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Perez-Pena, R. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/business/media/27audit.html "U.S. Newspaper Circulation falls 10%"], ''New York Times'', 26 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the report, free online content and business models were blamed for their part in the downturn; an opinion in agreement with Murdoch's article.
''The Wall Street Journal'''s circulation in 2009 defied the trend  as their circulation rose 0.6% and in 2010 they topped the list of circulating figures for American newspapers .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audit Bureau of Circulation |url=http://abcas3.accessabc.com/ecirc/newstitlesearchus.asp |accessdate=2010-11-08 |date=2010-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FBtAYyh5?url=http://abcas3.accessabc.com/ecirc/newstitlesearchus.asp |archivedate=17 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Journal'' sells online subscriptions, which is seen as a reason for their success.

==Revenue models==
Traditional print based media relies heavily upon advertisements and classified adverts for the generation of the majority of their revenue, which accounts for upwards of three quarters of total income.&lt;ref&gt;Mensing, D. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3677/is_200704/ai_n25137495/ 'Online Revenue Business Model Has Changed Little Since 1996'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206162354/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3677/is_200704/ai_n25137495/ |date= 6 February 2010 }}, ''Newspaper Research Journal'' Spring, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  This subsidy covers the expensive printing and distribution costs of the publication which was estimated to be between 30-40% and 11% respectively of total operating costs in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Ahlers, D.[http://www.jour.unr.edu/donica/Desktop/ahlers.pdf "News Consumption and the New Electronic Media"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718203027/http://www.jour.unr.edu/donica/Desktop/ahlers.pdf |date=18 July 2011 }} ''Harvard International Journal of Press &amp; Politics'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Although online advertisements revenue have overtaken their print counterparts recently, the vast majority of this is spent on search engines and pay-per-click content rather than more traditional advertising on news websites such as banners.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8280557.stm "Online Advertising 'Overtakes TV'"] ''BBC Business News'' 30 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Users do not appear willing to pay for general digital news content.  Publications such as the ''New York Times'' have launched premium subscription based content ''TimeSelect'' in the past but uptake was low and it was eventually removed, but this is not to say that users will never pay for content, yet as of now it has not been successful for a mainstream publication as a method of generating revenue.    James Jarvis, an American journalist, stated that "''TimesSelect'' is dead...with it goes any hope of charging for content online, Content is now and forever free".&lt;ref&gt;Jarvis, J. [http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/09/17/times-deselected/ " Times deselected"] ''BuzzMachine'' 17 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  One reason for this is that there is an abundance of free sources online for news, therefore few users will feel the need to pay for content that is available without charge  elsewhere. Murdoch states that it is his belief that users in the future will indeed be willing to pay for digital news if the content is worthy, which is evident in the recent launch of ''[[The Daily (News Corporation)|The Daily]]'', an [[iPad]]-only daily newspaper which sells at 99 cents (US) per week.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12345686 "News Corp launches daily newspaper for iPad"] ''BBC Technology News'' 2 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In the UK, ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper (also owned by Murdoch) saw its readership decline by 90% in 2010 after it introduced a paywall.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, J. [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/20/times-paywall-readership] ''Guardian'' 20 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to Murdoch's article, Kathy Gill claims that customers will not pay for content that is available elsewhere for free and that there needs to be a distinction made between what they will and won't pay for.  There are also claims of hypocrisy in what Murdoch says as ''The Wall Street Journal'' has been criticised for not providing links to competitors in their own articles.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, K.E. [http://wiredpen.com/2009/12/08/rupert-murdoch-journalism-and-freedom-a-rebuttal/‚Äô‚Äô Rupert Murdoch: Journalism and Freedon ‚Äì A Rebuttal‚Äô‚Äô, 8 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attracting readers==
The globalisation of media and the new formats available are seen by Murdoch as an opportunity and the increased competition created good for consumers.  People no longer want to be restricted by one format so newspapers must adapt their delivery models.  Murdoch states that the customer base newspapers already have is an advantage as they can attract readers equally to their online versions.  The standard of journalism is also likely to be more professional.  Murdoch's vision of the future for newspapers online is that if readers are targeted and the content offered is of a high quality, people will be willing to pay for it.

==Technology==
As Murdoch states, readers use different technology platforms to access news content. Portable devices with considerably better processors, such as [[smartphones]], laptops and tablet PCs which has made the gathering and dissemination of information much easier and increased the connection possibilities of news content which can be accessed by a larger number of people. Availability of news has now become considerabley more selective and flexible in terms of where it can be accessed. This means that it is likely that those who seek online news will consume more news in general as those who purchase the physical copy of the newspaper will be more and not less likely to access the same publications website.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, A, [http://informationr.net/ir/11-3/paper259.html "The complementary relationship between the Internet and traditional mass media: the case of online news and information"], ''Information research'', 3 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Murdoch states that adherence to business models based upon advertising on the part of news papers is responsible for declining revenues. Additionally, those who consume a lot of news offline will access online news more frequently. This, he argues, means that journalists and readers alike have perhaps been able to research more thoroughly using search engines, stumbling serendipitously upon sources online which they may not have encountered in an analogue environment.&lt;ref&gt;Downie, L, [http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/system/documents/1/original/Reconstruction_of_Journalism.pdf "The Reconstruction of American Journalism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815204254/http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/system/documents/1/original/Reconstruction_of_Journalism.pdf |date=15 August 2011 }}, 20 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This has given rise to new challenges for media organisations in terms of delivering content to users. .

It is debatable whether online and offline news content are competing or complementary products.  Some argue that the Internet presents too much competition for traditional newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Farhi, P. [http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4623] ''Don't Blame the Journalism'' October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of trust, there is also an assumption that news content delivered online may be inferior to content delivered by newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;de Waal, E, [http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/e.dewaal/bestanden/chapter%203.pdf "Online Newspapers: A Substitute or Complement for Print Newspapers and Other Information Channels?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718204328/http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/e.dewaal/bestanden/chapter%203.pdf |date=18 July 2011 }}, ''Communications: the European Journal of Communication Research'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also the issue of users finding online content less trust worthy. This could be linked to it being free and assumption that online news content is possibly less likeable, satisfying and enjoyable.  However, as the article discuss, technology is not necessarily the cause of the decline in revenues from traditional news paper formats. Others. like [[Google]] CEO [[Eric Schmidt]] say that technology is definitely not to blame and can actually help newspapers to progress and avoid decline.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, B. [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/08/google-eric-schmidt-newspapers] "Newspapers must keep innovating, says Google chief Eric Schmidt" 8 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Obsolescence of single delivery format is unlikely as both print and online serve different purposes and audiences.

==Content creators and aggregators==

Murdoch also attacks news aggregator services, which he sees as being parasitic in that they are benefiting from news which they have not created or contributed to in any way.  This refers to news websites who gather content for users, which allow them to access news stories on multiple sources, often on one specified area or topic of interest in order to save them time and effort but also blogs and even websites such as [[Yahoo! News]] and [[MSN]].  He comments that this it is particularly unfair to edit and rewrite articles that journalists have invested their time and effort in, especially in cases when they are not cited as being the original author or plagiarised. 
He challenges that this kind of behaviour constitutes [[fair use]] and that those who do not contribute or create the news content that they publish on their websites or blogs can profit from the efforts of the aforementioned journalist while adding very little themselves.  Also that this current practice cannot continue indefinitely.
Murdoch's statements were attacked by ''[[Huffington Post]]'' founder [[Arianna Huffington]] stating that "Murdoch confused aggregation with wholesale misappropriation". She argued that aggregation was not misappropriation and that most journalists liked the traffic consequently driven to them. Also, Murdoch's own companies were as guilty for aggregating content like the political tracker on [[Fox News]].com and the [[Rotten Tomatoes]] web site.&lt;ref&gt;Albanesius, C. [https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2356538,00.asp] ''Murdoch, Huffington Squabble Over Online News'' 1 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government intervention==
[[File:Rupert Murdoch.jpg|thumb|Rupert Murdoch, 12 January 2009]]
The level of financial support for newspapers from the American Government is decreasing and some believe this is a factor in the decline of the traditional newspaper industry.  One instance of where governments have withdrawn from the industry came with the rise of [[e-government]], bringing about less of a need for local authorities to pay for advertising space in newspapers.

There is a debate between those who are calling for more government funding to support the industry and others who believe this would be contrary to free speech and create unfair competition.&lt;ref&gt;Lipsky, S. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704597704574486242417039358 ''All the news that's fit to subsidise''], 21 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar examinations are occurring in other countries&lt;ref&gt;Waters, C. [http://globalmediastudies.blogspot.com/2010/02/european-media-subsidies.html ''European Media Subsidies''], 23 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; as countries like Austria, France Norway and Sweden are looking to change their current subsidy models.  It is possible for news organisations to receive public money and still maintain neutrality, most notably, the [[BBC]].  Tension also exists between direct subsidies like help with printing, distribution, research, and training, and indirect subsidies like tax concessions.  Indirect subsidies are a more common model of government intervention.

Changes in government legislation is seen as another option.  The example of the U.S. auto industry has been brought up to demonstrate that the newspaper industry needs more than financing to survive.  Murdoch asserts that newspapers themselves need to look at new ways of surviving, competing and generating revenue as government financing merely "props up those who are producing things that customers do not want".  As Murdoch suggests, new business models need to be created and the industry ‚Äì along with government - needs to be more proactive.  Better legislation concerning newspapers and for the protection of newspapers is, says Murdoch, the best way to ensure the future of quality journalism.

Legislation was introduced in 2009 by senator Ben Cardin of Maryland to help struggling newspapers.  Under section [[501(c)]] of the U.S. tax code, newspapers could become nonprofits and thus benefit from tax breaks similar to those awarded to charities, and educational and cultural nonprofits.  So far, the bill has not progressed in Congress and it is questioned whether newspapers with existing debt would be able to be saved by this.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, T. [https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/24/us-usa-congress-newspapers-idUSTRE52N67F20090324 ''U.S. bill seeks to rescue faltering newspapers''], 24 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) is also looking into protecting newspapers through policy.  New ways of generating revenue, greater protection of intellectual property (an area Murdoch expresses concern about), a redefining of "fair use", and potential areas of government intervention are discussed in the FTC's ''Potential Policy Recommendations to support the reinvention of Journalism''.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission [http://www.ftc.gov/opp/workshops/news/jun15/docs/new-staff-discussion.pdf ''Potential Policy Recommendations to Support the Reinvention of Journalism - Discussion Draft''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430221229/http://www.ftc.gov/opp/workshops/news/jun15/docs/new-staff-discussion.pdf |date=30 April 2011 }}, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a case for no intervention at all, and that newspapers must find their own way.  If this results in some of them ceasing to exist, this is merely the reflection of the market.  It may also encourage newspapers to find their own way of dealing with the downturn, perhaps through greater emphasis on collaboration with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Downie, L. and Schudson, M. [http://www.cjr.org/reconstruction/the_reconstruction_of_american.php?page=all ''The reconstruction of American Journalism''], 19 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Murdoch's article calls for the government to reassess its regulation of news corporation ownership and copyright legislation.  He believes that the governments role should be to protect the intellectual property of the newspapers and their journalists, get rid of regulations which hinder investment, and not restrict [[Cross ownership]] in the media.  The relaxing of regulation could lead to less choice for consumers.  American news is dominated by 5 corporations (including Murdoch's)&lt;ref&gt;Bagdikian, B.  (2004). ''New Media Monopoly''  Boston: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and a change in cross-ownership rules could hinder other news companies from prospering.

Growing up, Shepherd's father (Ken Shepherd) was a local radio personality and some-time concert promoter, and had a vast collection of music. Shepherd received his first "guitar" at the age of three or four, when his grandmother purchased a series of several plastic guitars for him with [[S&amp;H Green Stamps]], which Shepherd has said he would "go through like candy".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Shepherd stated in a 2011 interview that he began playing guitar in earnest at age seven, about six months after meeting and being "pretty mesmerized"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; by [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], Labor Day weekend in 1984, at one of his father's promoted concerts. His self-taught method employed a process of learning one note at a time, playing and rewinding cassette tapes, using "a cheap Yamaha wanna-be Stratocaster...made out of plywood, basically",&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and learning to play by following along with material from his father's record collection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Blues musician [[Bryan Lee]] invited 13 year old Shepherd to play guitar onstage. He subsequently made demo tapes, and a video was shot at Shepherd's first performance at the [[Red River Revel]] Arts Festival in Shreveport. It was this video performance that impressed [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] chief [[Irving Azoff]] enough to sign Shepherd to a multiple album record deal.

From 1995 on, Shepherd took seven [[single (music)|single]]s into the Top 10, and holds the record for the longest-running album on the ''Billboard'' Blues Charts with ''[[Trouble Is...]]''. In 1996, Shepherd began a longtime collaboration with vocalist Noah Hunt, who provided the vocals for Shepherd's signature song, "[[Blue on Black]]". Shepherd has been nominated for five [[Grammy Award]]s, and has received two [[Billboard Music Award]]s, two [[Blues Music Award]]s, and two Orville H. Gibson Awards.

In 2000, Shepherd played guitar on the end title theme for the animated feature ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]''.

In September 2008, Fender Musical Instruments Corp. released the Kenny Wayne Shepherd Signature Series Stratocaster, designed exclusively by Shepherd. In 2007, he released a critically acclaimed and two time [[Grammy]] nominated DVD‚ÄìCD project, ''[[10 Days Out: Blues from the Backroads]]''. This documents Shepherd as he travels the country to [[jam session|jam]] with and interview the last of the authentic blues musicians. As they tour the backroads, Shepherd, with members of the [[Double Trouble (band)|Double Trouble Band]], play with a host of blues greats including [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]] and Bryan Lee, Buddy Flett (with whom he jams at [[Lead Belly]]'s grave), [[B. B. King]], blues harp master [[Jerry McCain|Jerry "Boogie" McCain]], [[Cootie Stark]], [[Neal Pattman]], [[John Dee Holeman]], [[Etta Baker]], [[Henry Townsend (musician)|Henry Townsend]] with [[Honeyboy Edwards]], and a concert session with the surviving members of Muddy Waters' and [[Howlin' Wolf]]'s bands, including luminaries such as [[Hubert Sumlin]], [[Willie "Big Eyes" Smith]], and [[Pinetop Perkins]]. 

In 2010 Shepherd was nominated for a Grammy for ''Live In Chicago'' which featured performances with Hubert Sumlin, Willie "Big Eyes" Smith, Buddy Flett and Bryan Lee. In 2011, Shepherd released his seventh CD entitled ''How I Go'' on Roadrunner Records. In 2014 he released "Goin Home" on Mascot Label Group in Europe and on Concord Records in the US and the rest of the world. In 2015 Shepherd released "Something From the Road Vol. 1," a live special release for Record Store Day in the U.S.

In January 2017 the Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band went into the studio with producer [[Marshall Altman]] to record a new album of all newly written songs titled ''Lay It On Down'' and released the album on August 4 (July 21 in Europe on ''[[Mascot Label Group]]''). ''Lay It On Down'' is the eighth record by the Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Blues Chart.

==The Rides==
In 2013, Shepherd, along with [[Stephen Stills]] ([[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young|Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash]]) and [[Barry Goldberg]] ([[The Electric Flag|Electric Flag]]), formed [[The Rides]]. The three wrote, recorded, and released a CD entitled "Can't Get Enough" on August 27, 2013. Stills refers to the band as "the blues band of my dreams". The band toured the US in 2013 supporting their debut record, culminating with an appearance on [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]. The three reunited in 2015, writing and recording a second release, "Pierced Arrow" that was released on 429 Records and Mascot Label Group in Europe in 2016.

===Personal life===
Shepherd married Hannah Gibson, the daughter of actor [[Mel Gibson]], on September 16, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2006/09/18/mel-walks-his-daughter-down-the-aisle/ |title=Mel Walks His Daughter Down the Aisle |publisher=TMZ.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple has five children: three daughters and two sons.

The '''Maelstrom International Fantastic Film Festival''' ('''MIFFF'''), is a three day international [[genre film|genre]] [[film]] [[film festival|festival]] held annually in [[Seattle]], Washington.  MIFFF is the premiere [[Pacific northwest]] event devoted to [[Action film|action]], [[Animated film|animation]], [[Fantasy film|fantasy]], [[Horror film|horror]], and [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[Film|cinema]] from around the globe. The [[Seattle International Film Festival]] (SIFF) Cinema at [[McCaw Hall]] hosts  MIFFF which resides on the campus of [[Seattle Center]].

==Overview==
[[File:MIFFF-SIGN.jpg|thumb|right|Official posters outside the SIFF Cinema at McCaw Hall leading to the 2009 event.]]
The "Founding Fathers"&lt;ref name="MIFFFestival-r1" /&gt; of MIFFF are Eric Morgret, Isaac Alexander, Rick Tillman, Gabe de los Angeles &amp; Dan Doody. The festival was first conceived at a gathering in June 2008,&lt;ref name="MIFFFestival-r13" /&gt; which led to the first event taking place in September 2009.&lt;ref name="MIFFFestival-r2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MIFFFestival-r10" /&gt; The event was created to offer exposure to films that traditionally are overlooked by the mainstream festival circuit from genres including action, animation, fantasy, horror, and science fiction.&lt;ref name="MIFFFestival-r11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MIFFFestival-r14" /&gt; The vision drew inspiration from other genre film festivals around the globe such as [[Fantasia Festival]] in Montreal, [[Fantastic Fest]] in Austin, and the first genre film festival, the [[Sitges Film Festival]] in Catalonia.  MIFFF was registered shortly thereafter as a Washington State non-profit and acts as the parent organization of the Maelstrom International Fantastic Film Festival. The festival feature a diverse selection of [[Cult film|cult]] genre cinema from around the globe ‚Äì with the possibility of artists presenting the works themselves.

The '''Michelin Le Mans Cup''' (GT3 Le Mans Cup in 2016) is a European [[sports car racing]] endurance series inspired by the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race and run by the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO).  The GT3 Le Mans Cup was created in 2016 after the [[Group GT3|GTC category]] being dropped of [[European Le Mans Series]] due to a lack of entries during [[2015 European Le Mans Series|2015]]. Aiming to increase the number of GT3 entries, ACO created a new six event competition (5 events of 2 hours and an one-hour race at Le Mans - with LMP3) destinated primarily for amateur drivers, leading to more media coverage and competitive races (in ELMS, GT3 were much slower than the other 3 categories).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetlemans.com/2016/05/04/villorba-corse-to-enter-2016-michelin-gt3-le-mans-cup/|title=Villorba Corse to enter 2016 Michelin GT3 Le Mans Cup|first=News|last=Release|date=4 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemanscup.com/en/elms/story/5/62?year=2016|title=History - Michelin Le Mans Cup|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crash.net/sportscars/news/224384/1/aco-launches-michelin-gt3-le-mans-cup.html|title=ACO launches Michelin GT3 Le Mans Cup - Sportscars News|first=Crash Media Group|last=Ltd.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The champion team receives an automatic invitation to take part on the following [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in LMGTE Am category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/122272|title=Prize fund revealed for new GT3 Le Mans Cup|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[2017 Michelin Le Mans Cup|2017 season]], the series will feature LMP3 and GT3 category cars competing in their respective class, with ACO aiming to create a kind of LMP3 secondary division regarding ELMS, promoting the best teams from Michelin LMC to ELMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportscar365.com/lemans/lemans-cup/lmp3-cars-added-to-michelin-le-mans-cup-for-2017/|title=LMP3 Cars Added to Michelin Le Mans Cup for 2017 - Sportscar365|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Cyber Crime Unit''' ('''NCCU''') is a command of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[National Crime Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/about-us/what-we-do/national-cyber-crime-unit |title=National Cyber Crime Unit |publisher=Nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the creation of the National Crime Agency in 2013, the unit was formed following the merge of the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]]'s  cyber division with the [[Police Central E-Crime Unit]] (PCeU) of the [[Metropolitan Police Service]], and is one of four current commands which look at the growing use of cyber crime and ways to identify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Warwick Ashford |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240206747/UK-National-Cyber-Crime-Unit-becomes-operational |title=UK National Cyber Crime Unit becomes operational |publisher=Computerweekly.com |date=2013-10-07 |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January, fighting was renewed in the area of the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in Aleppo's Old City, as the rebels claimed of destroying a Hezbollah base at Mount Hoihna and capturing most of the buildings in the town Maarath Al-Artik, on Aleppo's northwest outskirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/16419719-syria-opposition-advancing-in-aleppo-taking-positions-both-from-assad-and-jihadists |title=Syria: Opposition Advancing In Aleppo Taking Positions Both From Assad And Jihadists: |publisher=Allvoices.com |date=2014-01-27 |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203163601/http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/16419719-syria-opposition-advancing-in-aleppo-taking-positions-both-from-assad-and-jihadists |archivedate=2014-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 February, the Army made progress in the Sheikh Najjar industrial zone, with rebels sending reinforcements to the area. The military was attempting to capture strategic areas in Sheikh Najjar that overlook the outskirts of the Aleppo central prison, which had been under a rebel siege for over a year.

=== Final Army push to the prison ===
In early May, government forces captured the Al-Majbal area and the Breij roundabout, thus taking control of the northeastern entrance to Aleppo. This also brought government forces close to the central prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syriahr.com/index.php?option=com_news&amp;nid=18672&amp;Itemid=2&amp;task=displaynews#.U2P3uvmSyfU |title=System controls the entrance to the north-east of Aleppo |publisher=Syriahr.com |date=2014-05-02 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army also reached the al-Kindi Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/EjmAlrai/status/462215030478745600 |title=Elijah J Magnier |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date=2014-05-03 |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503113727/https://twitter.com/EjmAlrai/status/462215030478745600 |archivedate=May 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the SOHR, 21 rebel fighters and 30 pro-government fighters were killed in the clashes, in addition to three disabled Army tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syriahr.com/en/index.php?option=com_news&amp;nid=2228&amp;Itemid=2&amp;task=displaynews#.U2gRk_l_tCg |title=More than 60 fighters killed in Aleppo yesterday |publisher=Syriahr.com |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other opposition sources denied the claim saying rebel forces had made no progress in the Bureij area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TahrirSy/status/463219915466764288 |title=TahrirSy |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Alepponian/status/463214688281849856 |title=Alepponian |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, rebels managed to retake the al-Majbal area at the cost of at least 27 fighters, while the Army suffered several casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syriahr.com/index.php?option=com_news&amp;nid=18936&amp;Itemid=2&amp;task=displaynews#.U21Snvl_tCg |title=Rebels retake al-Majbal area near the Aleppo central prison |publisher=Syriahr.com |date=2014-05-09 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May, the Army captured the Sheikh Najjar power plant and Agop hill right next to it, which opened the way towards the central prison, bringing government troops to one kilometer from the prison complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syriahr.com/index.php?option=com_news&amp;nid=19270&amp;Itemid=2&amp;task=displaynews |title=1 kilometer separates the regime forces from the central prison of Aleppo |publisher=Syriahr.com |date=2014-05-20 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also reports that some troops had already arrived to reinforce the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÜÿ™ÿÆÿßÿ®ÿßÿ™ |url=http://tahrirsouri.com/2014/05/21/%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D9%84%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%AD-%D8%A8%D9%81%D9%83/ |title=Rapid developments in Aleppo .. system works to break the siege on the Central Prison in Aleppo and news of his downfall |publisher=Tahrirsouri.com |date=2014-05-21 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the capture of the hill, the military attacked the village of Hilan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://syriahr.com/index.php?option=com_news&amp;nid=19269&amp;Itemid=2&amp;task=displaynews |title=System locked in fierce clashes in an attempt to decode Alhsaran central prison |publisher=Syriahr.com |date=2014-05-20 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the last rebel stronghold before the prison.

The next day, the military captured Hilan, as government forces had broken through on the road leading to the prison. At the same time, rebels blew up the Kindi hospital in fear it could be used for monitoring rebel supply routes if the advancing government troops managed to capture it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2014/May-21/257295-syria-army-presses-bid-to-break-prison-siege-reports.ashx#axzz32Mc8BDkD |title=Syria army presses bid to break prison siege: reports |publisher=Dailystar.com.lb |date=2014-05-21 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Army tanks had reached and taken up positions at about 500 meters from the prison complex.

By 25 May, the military was in control of Sector 1 of the industrial zone and had captured the town of Jbeileh next to the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CdricLabrousse/status/470272075966316544 |title=The Arab Chronicle |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sheikh Najjar captured ===
On 3 July, after an assault which included 20 airstrikes, government forces fully captured the industrial district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/xinhua-news-agency/140703/syrian-army-recaptures-aleppos-industrial-city|title=Syrian army recaptures Aleppo's industrial city|work=GlobalPost|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This left the Infantry Academy and the Handarat camp as the only two rebel-held areas the Army would need to capture to complete the siege of Aleppo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/07/aleppo-rebels-islamic-state-syria-regime-annihilation.html#|title=Aleppo rebels caught between Islamic State and regime|work=Al-Monitor|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; after three major rebel supply routes had been cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/07/16/331995284/syrias-army-on-the-verge-of-retaking-the-countrys-largest-city|title=Syria's Army On The Verge Of Retaking The Country's Largest City|date=16 July 2014|work=NPR.org|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Days later, government reinforcements arrived, which included members of the elite Republican Guards and Hezbollah, and the military captured the villages of [[Kafr Saghir|Kafr al-Saghir]] and Moqbila, advancing towards the Infantry Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2014/07/07/syrian-troops-advance-in-largest-city|title=Syrian troops advance in and around the country's largest city of Aleppo|work=US News &amp; World Report|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebel reinforcements had also been dispatched to Aleppo, however, one brigade numbering 1,000 fighters that was supposedly sent from Idlib province to reinforce opposition forces in Aleppo city used the chance and defected to the rival extremist [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/07/08/3992446/1000-syrian-rebels-defect-to-islamic.html|title=1,000 Syrian rebels defect to Islamic State in sign it‚Äôs still strengthening|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slow pace with which the Army advanced since the start of the operation was described as deliberate so the military could have time to consolidate control over captured territory. According to one diplomat, "They haven't lost any areas they have taken back. It is not a battle of back-and-forth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/r-syrian-government-forces-squeeze-insurgents-in-aleppo-2014-09|title=Syrian government forces squeeze insurgents in Aleppo|date=9 July 2014|work=Business Insider|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rebel counter-attacks repelled, continued Army advance ===

By mid-August, only three miles remained before the military could completely cut rebel supply lines into the city, after the opposition forces‚Äô position deteriorated in the previous month following failed rebel counterattacks that attempted to dislodge government troops from the industrial zone. The rebels also attempted to capture the military academy in the western outskirts of the city, in an attempt to force government forces to reposition from the east to the west. However, the attack ended in catastrophe after the rebels were exposed to repeated air strikes, even at night, that made it impossible to move men and weapons freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/2014/08/11/3243308/moderate-rebels-face-worsening.html|title=Moderate rebels face worsening situation in Aleppo|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812204546/http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/2014/08/11/3243308/moderate-rebels-face-worsening.html|archivedate=12 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 20 and 23 August, heavy fighting raged at the Handarat district, which was reportedly being besieged by government forces, while the military claimed to had captured the village of Jbeileh, which the rebels used to conduct attacks on the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-makes-substantial-gains-aleppo-governate/|title=The Syrian Army Makes Substantial Gains in the Aleppo Governate|author=Leith Fadel|work=Al-Masdar News|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the capture of Jbeileh, the Army attacked the "cement factory", with expectations it would be captured within a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13930601001082|title=Intense battles around Aleppo Cement Factory / Factory to release in few hours|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle for the Handarat area===

On 3 October, following a two-month stalemate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/updated-battle-map-aleppo-handaraat-liberated-syrian-arab-army/|title=Updated Battle Map of Aleppo: Handaraat Liberated by the Syrian Arab Army|author=Leith Fadel|work=Al-Masdar News|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Army, supported by the NDF, Hezbollah, Al-Quds Brigades and Ba'ath Brigades, finally captured the village of Handarat and its hill,&lt;ref name="syriahroe"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/syriahroe/posts/591394617635547|title=Aleppo Province|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus cutting off one of the two last rebel supply lines for opposition-held areas in Aleppo city.&lt;ref name="couldsoon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-syria-aleppo-siege-20141123-story.html|title=Aleppo, Syria, could soon be under siege by government troops|author=Los Angeles Times|date=23 November 2014|work=latimes.com|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army quickly erected barriers on the road so it would be closed off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/21843|title=Syrian army clashes with rebels in Aleppo, regains full control of Handarat|work=Al Akhbar English|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government forces also captured the villages of al-Mudafah and Sifat and a four-way intersection west of Sifat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/03/uk-syria-crisis-aleppo-idUKKCN0HS0ZU20141003|title=Syrian army seizes villages north of Aleppo - state TV|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the rebels counter-attacked in an attempt to recapture the hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/news/syria-troops-threaten-rebel-supply-route-to-aleppo_27025|title=Syria troops threaten rebel supply route to Aleppo|work=Your Middle East|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 45 rebels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syriahr.com/index.php?option=com_news&amp;nid=24430&amp;Itemid=2&amp;task=displaynews#.VC9P2_mSyyE|title=Bhandarat violent clashes and the killing and the death of at least 65 from both sides|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 32 soldiers were killed during the day's fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syriahr.com/index.php?option=com_news&amp;nid=24445&amp;Itemid=2&amp;task=displaynews#.VC_92vmSyyE|title=Continuing clashes and the killing of 32-element regime forces in Handarat|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final supply route,&lt;ref name="couldsoon"/&gt; via the Castello Road and al-Jandul roundabout,&lt;ref name="syriahroe"/&gt; came under constant air-strikes&lt;ref name="couldsoon"/&gt; and was monitored.&lt;ref name="syriahroe"/&gt;

In early November, the last remaining rebel supply route, the Castello Road, was within firing range of the Syrian Army and they were in position to close it off at any time, but were still leaving it open, possibly to give a chance to anyone who wanted to leave the city before they implemented the siege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/11/6/u-s-anti-isil-strategyfacesmajorsetbackinsyriassecondcity.html|title=US anti-ISIL strategy faces major setback in Syria‚Äôs second city|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Ottoman-Hungarian War}}

The '''Ottoman‚ÄìHungarian Wars''' were a series of battles between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Following the [[Byzantium under the Palaiologoi|Byzantine Civil War]], the Ottoman [[Fall of Gallipoli|capture of Gallipoli]], and the decisive [[Battle of Kosovo]], the Ottoman Empire was poised to conquer the entirety of the Balkans and also sought and expressed desire to expand further north into [[Central Europe]] beginning with the Hungarian lands.

Initial Hungarian success culminated in the [[Crusade of Varna]], though without significant outside support the Hungarians were defeated. Nonetheless the Ottomans suffered more [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|defeats at Belgrade]], even after the [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]]. In particular, the notorious [[Vlad III Dracula|Vlad the Impaler]], with limited Hungarian help, resisted Ottoman rule until the Ottomans placed his brother, a man less feared and less hated by the populace, on the throne of [[Wallachia]]. Ottoman success was once again halted at Moldavia due to Hungarian intervention, but the Turks finally succeeded when Moldavia and then Belgrade fell to [[Bayezid II]] and [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], respectively. In 1526 the Ottomans crushed the Hungarian army at [[Battle of Moh√°cs|Moh√°cs]] with King [[Louis II of Hungary]] perishing along with 14,000-20,000 of his foot soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Turner &amp; Corvisier &amp; Childs, ''A Dictionary of Military History and the Art of War'', pp. 365‚Äì366 "In 1526, at the battle of Moh√°cs, the Hungarian army was destroyed by the Turks. King Louis II died, along with 7 bishops, 28 barons and most of his army (4,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry)."&lt;br&gt;Minahan, ''One Europe, many nations: a historical dictionary of European national groups'', p. 311 "A peasant uprising, crushed in 1514, was followed by defeat by the Ottoman Turks at the decisive battle of Mohacs in 1526. King Louis II and more than 20,000 of his men perished in battle, which marked the end of Hungarian power in Central Europe."&lt;/ref&gt; Following this defeat, the eastern region of the Kingdom of Hungary (mainly [[Transylvania]]) became an Ottoman [[tributary state]], constantly engaged in [[civil war]] with [[Royal Hungary]]. The war continued with the [[Habsburgs]] now asserting primacy in the conflict with [[Ottoman Sultans|Suleiman and his successors]]. The northern and most of the central parts of Hungary managed to remain free from Ottoman rule, but the Kingdom of Hungary, the most powerful state east of Vienna under [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias II]], was now divided and constantly threatened by Ottoman ambitions in the region.

==Background==
In the century after the death of [[Osman I]] in 1326, Ottoman rule began to extend over the eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. The important city of [[Thessaloniki]] was captured from the Venetians in 1387,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and the Turkish victory at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389 effectively marked the end of Serbian power in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into the rest of Europe.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Balkan and Turkish wars of Louis the Great==
In 1344 [[Louis I of Hungary]], who would rule from 1342‚Äì1382 and earn the epithet "the Great", invaded [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] and established a system of vassalage.&lt;ref&gt;Ion Grumeza: The Roots of Balkanization: Eastern Europe C.E. 500-1500, University Press of America, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QKhuxLdnYhMC&amp;pg=PA91]&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis and his 80,000 strong army repelled the Serbian [[Stefan Uro≈° IV Du≈°an of Serbia|Du≈°an's]] armies in the duchies of [[Maƒçva]] and principality of [[Travunia]] in 1349. When Czar Du≈°an broke into [[Bosnia]]n territory he was defeated by Bosnian [[Stjepan II Kotromaniƒá|Stjepan II]] with the assistance of Louis' troops, and when Du≈°an made a second attempt he was decisively beaten by Louis in 1354.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/austriahungarywa00ludwrich/austriahungarywa00ludwrich_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; The two monarchs signed a peace agreement in 1355.

[[File:1396-Battle of Nicopolis-Hunername-2.jpg|thumb|170px|The [[Battle of Nicopolis]], as depicted by Turkish miniaturist]]
His latter campaigns in the Balkans were aimed not so much at conquest and subjugation as at drawing the Serbs, Bosnians, Wallachians and Bulgarians into the fold of the Roman Catholic faith and at forming a united front against the Turks. It was relatively easy to subdue the Balkan Orthodox countries by arms, but to convert them was a different matter. Despite Louis' efforts, the peoples of the Balkans remained faithful to the Eastern Orthodox Church and their attitude toward Hungary remained ambiguous. Louis annexed [[Moldavia]] in 1352 and established a vassal principality there, before conquering Vidin in 1365. The rulers of Serbia, Walachia, Moldavia, and Bulgaria became his vassals. They regarded powerful Hungary as a potential menace to their national identity. For this reason, Hungary could never regard the Serbs and Wallachians as reliable allies in subsequent wars against the Turks.

In the spring of 1365, Louis headed a campaign against the [[Bulgaria]]n [[Tsardom of Vidin]] and its ruler [[Ivan Sratsimir of Bulgaria|Ivan Sratsimir]]. He seized the city of [[Vidin]] on 2 May 1365; the [[Hungarian occupation of Vidin|region was under Hungarian rule]] until 1369.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = –ë–æ–∂–∏–ª–æ–≤ | first = –ò–≤–∞–Ω | year = 1994 | title = –§–∞–º–∏–ª–∏—è—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –ê—Å–µ–Ω–µ–≤—Ü–∏ (1186‚Äì1460). –ì–µ–Ω–µ–∞–ª–æ–≥–∏—è –∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Å–æ–ø–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—è | location = –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è | publisher = [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences|–ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ –∞–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—è –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—É–∫–∏—Ç–µ]] | language = Bulgarian |oclc=38087158 |isbn=954-430-264-6 |chapter=–ò–≤–∞–Ω –°—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–º–∏—Ä, —Ü–∞—Ä –≤—ä–≤ –í–∏–¥–∏–Ω (1352‚Äì1353&amp;nbsp;‚Äî 1396) |pages=202‚Äì203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1366 Byzantine Emperor [[John V Palaiologos|John V]] visited Hungary to beg for help against the Ottoman Turks, who were in increasing conflict with the Balkan vassal states. Louis defeated the Turks when Hungarian and Turkish troops clashed for the first time in history at Nicapoli in 1366. He defeated the Turkish army in [[Wallachia]] in 1374.

The [[Battle of Nicopolis]] (25 September 1396) is thought to be the first large-scale encounter between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, where a broad alliance of Christian monarchs and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] were defeated by a numerically superior Turkish army (the Ottomans had also enlisted the support of their new vassal, the [[Serbian Despotate]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Timur and the Ottoman Interregnum==
{{see also| Ottoman Interregnum}}
Despite these successes the Ottomans were dealt a major setback when at [[Battle of Ankara|Ankara]] in 1402 Timur of the [[Chagatai Khanate]] captured the Ottoman Sultan [[Bayezid the Thunderbolt]] (so named for the speed of his crushing victories against his Christian opponents, most notably at [[Crusade of Nicopolis|Nicopolis]]). After a decade of internecine battles, [[Mehmed I]] emerged victorious and reestablished the Ottoman Empire, although under the suzerainty of the Byzantine Emperor.

==Campaigns of Murad II, 1421‚Äì1451==
[[Murad II]], the successor to Mehmed I, proved to be a man of far greater military skills then his peaceful predecessor. In 1422, no longer professing suzerainty to the Byzantines, he [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|laid siege]] to Constantinople, which narrowly avoided becoming an Ottoman conquest. However he had managed to capture lands surrounding Constantinople. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

With Byzantium no longer a threat, Murad II began his war against his Christian opponents, attacking Macedonia and capturing Thessalonika from the Venetians in 1430. Between 1435 and 1436 the Ottomans made a show of strength in Albania, but the country survived due to intervention from the Kingdom of Hungary, whose borders now neared those of the Ottoman Empire.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Campaigns of John Hunyadi==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
In the 1440s and 1450s, the Hungarian military leader [[John Hunyadi]] became the key architect of campaigns against the Ottoman Empire. In 1441 he scored a pitched battle victory at [[Smederevo|Semendria]] over [[Ishak Bey]]. The following year, he annihilated an Ottoman force invading Transylvania at [[Sibiu]].{{citation needed|date = January 2013}} Following this victory, Wallachia again accepted the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Hungary.{{citation needed|date = January 2013}} With the help of knights from western Europe, Hunyadi succeeded in capturing [[Ni≈°|Nis]] on November 3, 1443, defeating another Turkish army as they crossed the Balkan Mountains and then taking another victory on Christmas Day. Because supplies for the Crusader army were low, Hunyadi concluded a ten-year peace treaty with Murad II, presumably on Hunyadi's terms, for it was the triumphant Hungarian that entered [[Buda]] in February 1444. Ten years was the maximum time permitted by Islamic law for a treaty with an "infidel". The peace was short lived, as Cardinal [[Julian Cesarini]] incited the Hungarians to break the treaty and attack the Turks once more. However, much of the Crusader armies' strength had been reduced due to the loss (by defection) of Serbia, Albania and the Byzantine Empire.

===Battle of Varna===
{{main|Battle of Varna}}
The Crusader army attacked across the Danube. Murad, upon hearing of the Christian breach of the treaty, is said to have mounted the broken treaty on his standard and said the words, "Christ, if you are God as your followers claim, punish them for their perfidy".{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The two armies met on November 10, 1444 near [[Varna]] in eastern [[Bulgaria]]. Accounts vary as to how many troops were present but the Crusaders may have been 30,000 strong whilst the Ottoman forces were two to three times larger. Nonetheless, Hunyadi's successful defense wagons held the line until [[W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of Poland|King Ladislas]] led a charge to his death against the Turkish lines. His head was mounted on a spear where all the defeated Crusaders could see it. Few Crusaders survived the battle, although Hunyadi did escape with his life.

[[File:Battle of Varna 1444.PNG|thumb|right|[[Battle of Varna]]]]

===After Varna===
The Hungarians recovered their strength after Varna and Hunyadi was able to lead another expedition down the Danube. Turkish counter-attacks saw this "crusade" driven back. After Murad dealt with the Greeks at the Peloponesse and others who had fought him at Varna, he turned his attention to Albania, whose leader, once an Ottoman hostage, was now a popular resistance leader. Hunyadi could not refuse an offer to fight the Turks and in 1448 an army of some 24,000 Hungarians marched south into Serbia. At the [[Battle of Kosovo (1448)|Second Battle of Kosovo]] Murad scored another victory against the Hungarians. This time, Hunyadi had had enough and was unable to campaign against the Ottoman Sultan. Murad II passed on his powers to his successor, [[Mehmed II]]. Thanks to such victories, the Ottoman forces were able to [[Fall of Constantinople|capture Constantinople]] in 1453 with only the Italians offering minimal support to the Byzantines.

===Battle of Belgrade (1456)===
Meanwhile, the Ottoman issue had again become acute, and, after the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]] was rallying his resources to subjugate Hungary. His immediate objective was N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r (today Belgrade). N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r was a major castle-fortress, and a gatekeeper of south Hungary. The fall of this stronghold would have opened a clear way to the heart of Central Europe. Hunyadi arrived at the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]] at the end of 1455, after settling differences with his domestic enemies. At his own expense, he restocked the supplies and arms of the fortress, leaving a strong garrison there under the command of his brother-in-law [[Mih√°ly Szil√°gyi]] and his own eldest son [[L√°szl√≥ Hunyadi]]. He proceeded to form a relief army, and assembled a fleet of two hundred ships. His main ally was the [[Franciscan]] [[friar]], [[Giovanni da Capistrano]], whose fiery oratory drew a large [[crusade]] made up mostly of peasants. Although relatively ill-armed (most were armed with farm equipment, such as [[scythe]]s and [[pitchfork]]s) they flocked to Hunyadi and his small corps of seasoned [[mercenary|mercenaries]] and [[cavalry]].

On July 14, 1456 the [[flotilla]] assembled by Hunyadi destroyed the Ottoman fleet. On July 21, Szil√°gyi's forces in the fortress repulsed a fierce assault by the [[Rumelia]]n army, and Hunyadi pursued the retreating forces into their camp, taking advantage of the Turkish army's confused flight from the city. After fierce but brief fighting, the camp was captured, and Mehmet raised the siege and returned to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. With his flight began a 70-year period of relative peace on Hungary's southeastern border.

However, plague broke out in Hunyadi's camp three weeks after the lifting of the siege, and he died on August 11. He was buried inside the ([[Roman Catholic]]) [[Cathedral]] of [[Alba Iulia]] (''Gyulafeh√©rv√°r''), next to his younger brother John. Sultan Mehmet II paid him tribute: "Although he was my enemy I feel grief over his death, because the world has never seen such a man."{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

During the battle, Pope Callixtus III had ordered the bells of every European church to be rung every day at noon, as a call for believers to pray for the defenders of Belgrade. However, in many countries (like England and the Spanish kingdoms), news of the victory arrived before the order, and the ringing of the church bells at noon thus transformed into a commemoration of the victory. The pope never withdrew the order, and many Catholic and older Protestant churches still ring the noon bell to this day.

Hunyadi's son [[Matthias Corvinus]] was crowned king in [[Buda]] in 1458 at the age of 15. In 1471 Matthias renewed  the [[Serbian Despotate]] in south Hungary under [[Vuk Grgureviƒá]] for the protection of the borders against the Ottomans. In 1479 an Ottoman army, on its return home from ravaging Transylvania, was annihilated at Sz√°szv√°ros (modern [[OrƒÉ≈ütie]], 13 October 1479) in the [[Battle of Breadfield]]. The following year Matthias recaptured Jajce, drove the Ottomans from northern Serbia and instituted two new military [[banat]]s, Jajce and Srebernik, from reconquered Bosnian territory.

[[File:Keny√©rmez≈ëi csata.jpg|thumb|left|Battle of Breadfield]]

In 1480 an Ottoman fleet [[siege of Otranto|seized Otranto]] in the Kingdom of Naples. At the earnest solicitation of the pope Matthias sent the Hungarian general, Bal√°zs Magyar, to recover the fortress, which surrendered on 10 May 1481. Again in 1488, Matthias took [[Ancona]] under his protection for a while, occupying it with a Hungarian garrison.

==Wallachian and Moldavian wars==

===Vlad the Impaler and war with Wallachia, 1456‚Äì1475===
Mehmed II's post-Constantinople troubles escalated further when the [[Balkan]] [[principality]] of [[Wallachia]] under Count [[Vlad III Dracul]] rebelled against the Ottoman Empire and declared the King of Hungary as his [[suzerain]]. The main drive for these actions was Vlad's return to his homeland after being in exile as a hostage of the Ottoman sultan. In 1461, five years after his return, Vlad initiated war with the Turks when he impaled the Turkish ambassadors demanding tribute from him and took the fortress of [[Giurgiu]]. Vlad then began a bloody assault across the Danube to the Black Sea, destroying as many of the ports as he could to prevent Ottoman naval attacks. Ottoman attempts to subdue Vlad militarily proved a failure, but his cruelty, which had terrorized his enemies, proved to be his undoing. When Mehmed offered the populace the choice of Vlad or his brother [[Radu cel Frumos|Radu]], the populace chose Radu and soon Vlad was again an exile on the run. An attempt to return a few years afterwards ended in his death in battle.

===Stephen the Great and war against Moldavia, 1475‚Äì1476===
Mehmed's army seems to have spent itself in Wallachia for the campaign against the [[Moldavia]]ns was shorter and yielded poorer results. In 1475 Mehmed ordered an invasion of Moldavia. Again, the Ottomans often took possession of the field but Moldavian hit-and-run tactics proved effective against the Turks. Poor roads further slowed the Ottomans until [[Stephen the Great]] was able to concentrate his forces at Vaslui. An Ottoman offensive was held in check and then finally driven from the field on 10 January 1475.

The Ottomans returned in 1476, this time assisted by their allies from Crimea, the Tartars and their newly conquered Vassal of Wallachia. Stephen knew that he did not have the resources to defend his people and evacuated them to the mountains. After a failed attack on the Ottoman vanguard Stephen seemed on the brink of defeat when King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary offered assistance. The Ottomans withdrew when the Hungarians began moving in and fighting did not resume until 1484.

==Bayezid II, 1481‚Äì1512==
The early reign of [[Bayezid II]] included a small civil war against his brother Jem, who escaped to the west. There European leaders entertained ideas of installing a pro-Western sultan while sending a crusade to the Balkans. Consequently, Bayezid did not incite any serious wars with his Christian opponents until his brother's death in 1495. In the meantime Bayezid signed a ten-year peace with Hungary in 1484, although this did not prevent a defeat of an Ottoman army at Villach in 1493. Between 1484 and 1486 Bayezid campaigned annually against Moldavia in an attempt to subdue it and link up with Crimea, his Muslim vassal and ally. Despite two defeats in 1485 and 1486 Moldavia was subjugated. As Bayezid's reign drew to a close he was entangled in a civil war between his sons Ahmed and Selim. Eventually Selim took the throne in 1512 and for the next eight years continued minor conquests in the west, although his main achievement was the conquest of the [[Mamluke Sultanate]]. It would be Selim's successor, Suleiman who would continue the war against Hungary.

==Campaigns of Suleiman the Magnificent, 1520‚Äì1566==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
[[Suleiman the Magnificent]] resumed the war against Hungary by attacking the city of [[Belgrade]], the same settlement that had defied Mehmed II over half a century earlier. Despite strong resistance, the city fell to Suleiman. In 1522 Suleiman took his army to a strategically successful siege of Rhodes, allowing the Knights Hospital to evacuate for the fort.

===Battle of Moh√°cs===
{{Main|Battle of Moh√°cs}}
[[File:2lajos.jpg|thumb|right|Discovery of the Corpse of King Louis II]]
When Suleiman launched an invasion in 1526 the Grand Vizier constructed a great bridge ahead of the Sultan allowing his army to march into Hungary. Despite eighty days of marching and taking five days to cross the [[Danube River]], the Ottomans met no resistance from the Hungarians. The original plan of Hungarian King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] had been to send a vanguard to hold the Danube where the Ottomans were expected to cross, yet the nobles of the Kingdom refused to follow the King's deputy in battle, claiming that they did so out of zealous allegiance to the King (and would therefore only follow him). Consequently, when King Louis II took the field his army of 36,000 men seemed to be doomed to fail against the Ottomans' 80,000.&lt;ref&gt;Sources such as this {{cite book|last=Stephen|first=Turnbull|title=The Ottoman Empire 1326‚Äì1699 |location=New York |publisher=Osprey |year=2003 |page=46}} support this number, other suggest a smaller number of 60,000&lt;/ref&gt; At Moh√°cs the plains of Hungary allowed the heavier Christian knights to launch an effective charge. As the Hungarian knights brushed aside first the [[Akinjis]] and then the [[Sipahis]], the Ottoman cavalry regrouped and flanked the Knights inflicting a moderate amount of casulties. The Sultan then placed his Janissaries and cannon into position chained up as an effective line . The Hungarian cavalry took serious casualties from the skilfully handled Turkish artillery. With the cavalry annihilated, the infantry suffered immense casualties as the weight of numbers of the Ottomans and their skill in battle took their toll. When Suleiman the Magnificent found the body of Louis II he is said to have been saddened by his untimely death.

===Aftermath of Moh√°cs===
[[John Z√°polya]], who had been instructed by Louis II to raid the enemy's supply lines, arrived at the battle too late and fled the scene. Suleiman, however, was not ready to annex the Kingdom completely into the Ottoman realm and in that power gap, Zapolya was chosen by Hungarian electorate as their ruler. Meanwhile, at the Diet of Bratislava Archduke Ferdinand of Austria was declared King of Hungary. The surviving nobles of Hungary now had to choose between pledging allegiance to a native vassal of Suleiman and a Christian "foreigner".
[[File:Johann Peter Krafft 005.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nikola ≈†ubiƒá Zrinski]]'s Charge from the Fortress of [[Siege of Szigetv√°r|Szigetv√°r]]]]

===After Zapolya's death===
Z√°polya would rule Hungary until his death in 1540. Following his demise, Hungary was split into three parts. The north-west (present-day Slovakia, western Transdanubia and Burgenland, western Croatia and parts of north-eastern present-day Hungary) remained under Habsburg rule; although initially independent, later it became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy under the informal name Royal Hungary. The Habsburg Emperors would from then on be also crowned as Kings of Hungary.

[[File:Sz√©kely, Bertalan - The Women of Eger - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|The Women of [[Siege of Eger (1552)|Eger]]]]

The eastern part of the kingdom (Partium and Transylvania) became at first an independent principality, but gradually was brought under Turkish rule as a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The remaining central area (most of present-day Hungary), including the capital of Buda, became a province of the Ottoman Empire.

The '''Pepsi Fruit Juice Flood''', also known as '''Pepsi‚Äôs Fruit Juice Release''', was a flood of 176,000 barrels (28 million liters) of fruit and vegetable juices into the streets of [[Lebedyan]], [[Russia]] and the [[Don River]], caused by the collapse of a [[PepsiCo]] warehouse.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/list/7-strange-disasters|title=The Great Molasses Flood and 6 Other Strange Disasters|last=Rafferty|first=John P.|date=|website=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tv.mk.ru/video/2017/04/25/kiselnye-berega-v-lebedyani-proizoshlo-navodnenie-iz-tysyach-litrov-soka.html|title=–ö–∏—Å–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥–∞: –≤ –õ–µ–±–µ–¥—è–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–∏–∑–æ—à–ª–æ –Ω–∞–≤–æ–¥–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏–∑ —Ç—ã—Å—è—á –ª–∏—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ —Å–æ–∫–∞|last=|first=|date=April 25, 2017|work=Moskovsky Komsolets|access-date=November 11, 2018|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 25, 2017, a PepsiCo warehouse's roof collapsed unexpectedly. The warehouse was located in Lebedyan, the center of Pepsi's operations in Russia, and operated by [[Lebedyansky (company)|Lebedyansky]]. The warehouse contained storage containers housing a variety of fruit and vegetable juices. The collapse of the roof caused two injuries and sent 28 million liters of juices into the streets of Lebedyan and the Don River. However, no deaths resulted from the spill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/04/25/a-pepsi-warehouse-in-russia-just-collapsed-and-flooded-a-town/|title=A Pepsi Warehouse in Russia Just Collapsed and Flooded a Town|last=Smith|first=Geoffrey|date=April 25, 2017|work=Fortune|access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pineapple, apricot, tangerine, grape, mango, pomegranate, apple, cherry, orange, grapefruit and tomato juices were all part of the spill.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Russian-Town-Flooded-by-28-Million-Litres-of-PepsiCo-Juice-20170502-0004.html|title=Russian Town Flooded by 28 Million Liters of PepsiCo Juices|last=|first=|date=May 2, 2017|work=TeleSur|access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was some concern that the juices might have damaged the aquatic ecosystem of the Don River, but water samples showed that there was no evidence of environmental damage caused by the spill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/town-flooded-28-million-litres-10302667|title=Town flooded by 28 million litres of Pepsi after soft drink factory collapse|last=McDougall|first=Zoey|date=April 26, 2017|work=Mirror|access-date=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At several meetings, [[Air Chief Marshal|ACM]] {{small|[[Four star General|(Gen.)]]}} Mehdi had objected Gen. Musharraf's [[grand strategy]] when he pointed out the aftermath of [[Operation Chengiz Khan|''Chengiz Khan'']], a successful mission of PAF but it led the start of 1971 war which end up as a disaster for Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Air Forces Monthly (UK)"/&gt; Therefore, Mehdi objected any direct confrontation mission&lt;ref name="Air Forces Monthly (UK)"/&gt; but favoured the patrolling missions and remaining silent in support of other officers who gave vital criticism of Musharraf.&lt;ref name="Air Forces Monthly (UK)"/&gt;

==Retirement==

In the military and political circles, [[Air Chief Marshal|ACM]] ({{small|[[Four star general|Gen.]]}}) Mehdi's image was widely known to have an [[Imposing|imposing personality]], and a direct but strict attitude towards his principles.&lt;ref name="Air Forces Monthly (UK)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tufail, PAF|first=Brigadier Kaisar|title=Himalayan Showdown|url=http://kaiser-aeronaut.blogspot.com/2009/01/kargil-conflict-and-pakistan-air-force.html|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=Air Forces Monthly (UK)|date=28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His retirement was eventually confirmed when a junior-most air force general was promoted take succeed him, leading to speculations that "PQ Mehdi's rather straight-faced and forthright dealings with a somewhat junior-general [[Pervez Musharraf]] (although both graduated with same class) particularly during Kargil conflict was a good reason to believe that the general decided to appoint a not-very-senior air chief marshal whom he could order around like one of his Corps Commanders.".&lt;ref name="Air Forces Monthly (UK)"/&gt;

Therefore, General Musharraf favoured to superseded five senior air force generals and appointed a sixth-in-line to the four-star rank once Mehdi was due for retirement.&lt;ref name="Air Forces Monthly (UK)"/&gt; However this perception was proved wrong by a new chief of air staff who was as solid as his predecessor and gave no quarter when it came to PAF's interests.&lt;ref name="Air Forces Monthly (UK)"/&gt;

The '''Royal Flora Ratchaphruek''' was an international [[horticultural exposition]] held 1 November 2006 to 31 January 2007 in the [[Thailand|Thai]] city [[Chiang Mai]] of [[Chiang Mai Province]] that drew 3,781,624 visitors. Recognised by the [[Bureau International des Expositions]] (BIE), it was one of the grand celebrations hosted by the Royal Thai Government in honor of King [[Bhumibol]], the world's longest reigning monarch.

'''The Ratchaphruek''' (''[[Cassia fistula]]'' L.) or [[golden shower tree]] is the ''de facto'' national flower of [[Thailand]]. Its yellow blossoms correspond to Monday, the birthday of Bhumibol.  It is also named "Khun" or "Chaiyaphruek".

The event was located on 80 hectares of land at the Royal Agricultural Research Center in the Mae Hia sub-district, [[Amphoe Mueang Chiang Mai|Mueang district]], [[Chiang Mai Province]] in northern [[Thailand]]. The 92 days of the expo featured 30 international gardens reflecting nations such as Japan, South Korea, Belgium, Netherlands, South Africa, and Canada. More than 2.5 million trees of 2,200 species of tropical plants and flowers were on display in this exhibition. The Association of International Horticultural Producers ([[AIPH]]), gave this expo A1 status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiph.org/site/index_en.cfm?act=teksten.tonen&amp;parent=4683&amp;varpag=4936#CategoryA1%7cAIPD |title=AIPH ‚Äì Exhibitions, history|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; its highest level. Such exhibitions occur only once a year throughout the world. In addition, a host country can only hold one such exhibition once a decade.

The festival included many highlights to attract tourists:

*'''Gardens for the king''' There were two features in this zone: one was ''international gardens,'' which were presented by 30 participating nations and covered 21,000 square meters; the other  was ''corporate gardens'', which covered 27,475 square meters, and were presented by both Thai state enterprises, and domestic and international major corporations.
*'''Ho Kham Royal Pavilion''' This building featured Lanna architecture, the architectural style of northern Thailand; inside, visitors saw pictures of King Bhumibol's works and his dedication.
*'''Thai Tropical Garden''' The enormous 100,000-square-meter garden showcased the diversity of tropical horticulture: fruit varieties, plants, flowers, herbs, and rare plants.
*'''Expo Plaza''' This was the focus of the exposition's  fun-filled activities, amenities, and services. Visitors were able to purchase products from royal projects and authentic local products from [[Chiang Mai]] such as handicrafts, paper umbrellas, and souvenirs.
*'''Cultural shows''' A total of 45 cultural shows from various regions of [[Thailand]] were performed, including traditional music and dance. In addition, cultural performances from other nations were presented.

The Thai government had expected an average of 20,000 visitors per day, with over 100,000 visitors on a crowded day, and 3 million visitors in total to attend the Royal Flora Ratchaphruek 2006. At the exposition's conclusion, organizers claimed that the exposition had injected 27 billion baht into the regional economy.

The Thai government has proposed transforming the site of the exposition into a permanent training center. Despite some complaints of corruption and substandard facilities, organizers believed the exposition achieved its goals of promoting tourism and developing Thai horticultural industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expo closes with ceremony of allegiance to His Majesty|url=http://www.bangkokpost.net/News/01Feb2007_news02.php
|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was open to the public in 2008 with many of the past highlights still very much in evidence, including the international exhibits. It is thought that it will remain to stay open as a valued addition to things to do in Chiang Mai. The park receives around 500 visitors a day at the moment, mainly Thai.

'''Shrove Tuesday''' (also known in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] as '''Pancake Tuesday''' or '''Pancake day''') is the day in February or March immediately preceding [[Ash Wednesday]] (the first day of [[Lent]]), which is celebrated in some countries by consuming pancakes. In others, especially those where it is called [[Mardi Gras]] or some translation thereof, this is a [[carnival]] day, and also the last day of "fat eating" or "gorging" before the fasting period of Lent.

This moveable feast is determined by [[Easter]]. The expression "Shrove Tuesday" comes from the word ''shrive'', meaning "[[Absolution|absolve]]".&lt;ref name="Melitta Weiss Adamson, Francine Segan 2008"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PPDIx6WWuOQC&amp;pg=PA354&amp;dq=Anglican+Mardi+Gras#v=onepage&amp;q=Anglican%20Mardi%20Gras&amp;f=false|title=Entertaining from Ancient Rome to the Super Bowl|author=Melitta Weiss Adamson, Francine Segan|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2008|quote=In Anglican countries, Mardis Gras is known as ''Shrove Tuesday''-from ''shrive'' meaning "confess"-or ''Pancake Tuesday"-after the breakfast food that symbolizes one final hearty meal of eggs, butter, and sugar before the fast.

Being the last day of the liturgical season historically known as [[Shrovetide]], before the [[penitential]] season of [[Lent]], related popular practices, such as indulging in food that one sacrifices for the upcoming forty days, are associated with Shrove Tuesday celebrations, before commencing the fasting and religious obligations associated with Lent. The term ''[[Mardi Gras]]'' is French for "Fat Tuesday", referring to the practice of the last night of eating richer, fatty foods before the ritual fasting of the [[Lent]]en season, which begins on [[Ash Wednesday]].

==History==
The tradition of marking the start of Lent has been documented for centuries. [[√Ülfric of Eynsham]]'s "Ecclesiastical Institutes" from around 1000 AD states: "In the week immediately before Lent everyone shall go to his confessor and confess his deeds and the confessor shall so shrive him as he then may hear by his deeds what he is to do [in the way of penance]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13763a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Shrovetide|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914062042/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13763a.htm|archivedate=14 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the late [[Middle Ages]], the celebration of Shrovetide lasted until the start of Lent.&lt;ref name=Self&gt;{{cite book|title=One Hundred Readings for Assembly|first=David|last=Self|p=24|publisher=Heinemann|year=1993|isbn=978-0-435-80041-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pancakes are commonly eaten on this day.

The word ''shrove'' is a form of the English word ''shrive'', which means to obtain [[absolution]] for one's [[sin]]s by way of [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] and doing [[penance]]. Thus Shrove Tuesday gets its name from the custom for Christians to be "shriven" before the start of Lent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13763a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Shrovetide|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018210012/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13763a.htm|archivedate=18 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-, [[Spanish language|Spanish]]- and [[Italian language|Italian]]-speaking countries, among others, it is known as [[Carnival]] (to use the [[English language|English]] spelling). This derives from Medieval Latin ''carnelevamen'' ("the putting away of flesh")&lt;ref&gt;[[American Heritage Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; and thus to another aspect of the Lenten fast. It is often celebrated with street processions or fancy dress.&lt;ref name=festivals/&gt; The most famous of these events is the [[Brazilian Carnival]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], while the Venetians celebrate carnival with a [[Carnival of Venice|masquerade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venice-carnival.org/en/approfondimento/9/history-of-venice-carnival.html|title=History of Venice Carnival|publisher=Oltrex|accessdate=27 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228083134/http://venice-carnival.org/en/approfondimento/9/history-of-venice-carnival.html|archivedate=28 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term "carnival" in other contexts derives from here. In Spain, the Carnival Tuesday is named "d√≠a de la tortilla" ("omelette day"): an omelette made with some sausage or pork fat is eaten.

In [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], the day is known as ''Fastelavn'' and is marked by eating ''fastelavnsboller''. Fastelavn is the name for Carnival in Denmark which is either the Sunday or Monday before Ash Wednesday. Fastelavn developed from the Roman Catholic tradition of celebrating in the days before Lent, but after Denmark became a Protestant nation, the holiday became less specifically religious. This holiday occurs seven weeks before Easter Sunday, with children dressing up in costumes and gathering treats for the Fastelavn feast. The holiday is generally considered to be a time for children's fun and family games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danishhomeofchicago.org/2014/02/20/fastelavn-celebration/|title=Fastelavn celebration|publisher=Danish Home of Chicago|accessdate=27 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228092515/http://danishhomeofchicago.org/2014/02/20/fastelavn-celebration/|archivedate=28 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
Pancakes are associated with the day preceding Lent, because they are a way to use up rich foods such as eggs, milk, and sugar, before the fasting season of the 40 days of Lent.  The liturgical [[Christian fasting|fasting]] emphasizes eating simpler food, and refraining from food that would give undue pleasure: in many cultures, this means no meat, dairy products, or eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abbamoses.com/fasting.html|title=The Fasting Rule of the Orthodox Church|author=|date=|website=www.abbamoses.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808184207/http://www.abbamoses.com/fasting.html|archivedate=8 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Cape Breton Island]] small tokens are frequently cooked in the pancakes.

Since 1950 the people of [[Liberal, Kansas|Liberal]] and Olney, both in Kansas, US, have held the "International Pancake Day" race between the two towns.

[[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] celebrates by closing the foreshore to all traffic, closing schools early, and inviting all to skip. Traditionally, long ropes were used from the nearby harbour. The [[town crier]] rang the pancake bell, situated on the corner of Westborough (main street) and Huntriss Row.

The children of the hamlet of [[Whitechapel, Lancashire|Whitechapel]], [[Lancashire]] keep alive a local tradition by visiting local households and asking "please a pancake", to be rewarded with oranges or sweets.

'''Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome''' ('''SADS'''), also known as '''sudden adult death syndrome''', '''sudden unexpected/unexplained death syndrome''' ('''SUDS'''), '''sudden unexpected/unexplained nocturnal death syndrome''' ('''SUNDS'''), is a sudden unexpected death of adolescents and adults, mainly during [[sleep]].&lt;ref&gt;Also known as SUDS. See:  Reddy PR, Reinier K, Singh T, Mariani R, Gunson K, Jui J, Chugh SS. Physical activity as a trigger of sudden cardiac arrest: The Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study. Int J Cardiol. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One relatively common type is known as [[Brugada syndrome]].&lt;ref name=NORD2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Brugada Syndrome|url=https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/brugada-syndrome/|website=NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)|accessdate=28 October 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brugada syndrome|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/brugada-syndrome|website=Genetics Home Reference|accessdate=28 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudden unexpected death syndrome is rare in most areas around the world. This syndrome occurs in populations that are culturally and genetically distinct, and people who leave the population carry with them the vulnerability to suddenly die during sleep. Sudden unexplained death syndrome was first noted in 1977 among southeast Asian [[Hmong people|Hmong]] refugees in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1981|volume=30|issue=47|journal=MMWR.

== Causes ==
A sudden death in a young person can be caused by heart disease (including [[cardiomyopathy]], [[congenital heart disease]], myocarditis, genetic [[connective tissue disorders]], or conduction disease), medication-related causes or other causes.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; Rare diseases called [[channelopathy|channelopathies]] may play a role such as [[long QT syndrome]] (LQTS), [[Brugada syndrome]] (BrS), CPVT ([[catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia]]), PCCD (progressive cardiac conduction defect), early repolarisation syndrome, mixed sodium channel disease, and short QT syndrome.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; No cause of death is found, even after extensive examination in 5% of cases.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720025547/http://sads.org.uk/SADS_booklet.pdf|title=When a young person dies suddenly|author=Elijah R Behr|publisher=Cardiac Risk in the Young - CRY|url=http://sads.org.uk/SADS_booklet.pdf|archivedate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=Lack of cause of death in 5% or examination in 5%?|date=September 2017}}

Medical examiners have taken into account various factors, such as nutrition, toxicology, heart disease, metabolism, and genetics. Although there is no real known definite cause, extensive research showed people 18 years or older were found to have suffered from a [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]], a condition in which the heart muscle becomes oddly thickened without any obvious cause.&lt;ref name="Eckart 1254‚Äì1261"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eckart|first=Robert E.|last2=Shry|first2=Eric A.|last3=Burke|first3=Allen P.|last4=McNear|first4=Jennifer A.|last5=Appel|first5=David A.|last6=Castillo-Rojas|first6=Laudino M.|last7=Avedissian|first7=Lena|last8=Pearse|first8=Lisa A.|last9=Potter|first9=Robert N.|title=Sudden Death in Young Adults|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0735109711015543|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|volume=58|issue=12|pages=1254‚Äì1261|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2011.01.049}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the most commonly identified abnormality in sudden death of young adults. In the instances where people experience sudden death, it is most commonly found that they were suffering from CAD ([[coronary artery disease]]) or ASCAD (atherosclerotic coronary artery disease), or any level of stress.&lt;ref name="Eckart 1254‚Äì1261"/&gt; However, studies reveal that people experienced early symptoms within the week before the terminal event such as chest pain at ~52% of victims, [[dyspnea]] at ~22%, [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] at ~7% and ~19% who experienced no symptoms.&lt;ref name="Eckart 1254‚Äì1261"/&gt; Scientists have also associated this syndrome with the gene [[SCN5A]] that is mutated and affects the function of the heart. However, all autopsies done on victims who suffered from this syndrome came back negative.&lt;ref name="Eckart 1254‚Äì1261"/&gt;

In Thailand, Laos, and the Philippines, ''bangungot'' (or in their term, sudden adult death syndrome) is caused by the Brugada syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inq7.net/lif/2004/jun/19/lif_7-1.htm|title=Bangungot' in family?

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis usually occurs post-mortem.

==Treatment==
The only proven way to prevent SADS is with an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]]. Oral antiarrhythmics such as [[propranolol]] are ineffective.&lt;ref name="DEBUT"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Circulation|year=2003|volume=107|issue=17|pages=2221&amp;ndash;6|title=Defibrillator Versus beta-Blockers for Unexplained Death in Thailand (DEBUT): a randomized clinical trial |vauthors=Nademanee K, Veerakul G, Mower M, etal |pmid=12695290|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000066319.56234.C8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
In 1980 a reported pattern of sudden deaths brought attention to the [[Centers for Disease Control]]. The first reported sudden death occurred in 1948 when there were 81 series of similar deaths of Filipino men in [[Oahu County, Hawaii]]. However, it did not become relevant because there was no pattern associated. This syndrome continued to become more significant as years went on. By the year of 1981-1982, the annual rate in the United States was high with 92/100,000 among Laotians-Hmong, 82/100,000 among other Laotian ethnic groups, and 59/100,000 among Cambodians.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Munger|first=Ronald|date=September 1987|title=Sudden Death in Sleep of Loatian-Hmong Refugees in Thailand: A Case-Control Study|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1647019/pdf/amjph00260-0037.pdf|pmc=1647019|journal=AJPH|doi=10.2105/ajph.77.9.1187|pmid=3618851|access-date=February 22, 2016|volume=77|pages=1187‚Äì90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This elevated rate is why the pattern of Asian sudden unexpected deaths was brought to attention in the United States.

===Particular prevalence===
Southeast Asian immigrants, who were mostly fleeing the [[Vietnam War]], most often had this syndrome, marking Southeast Asia as the area containing the most people with this fatal syndrome. However, there are other Asian populations that were affected, such as Filipinos and Chinese immigrants in the Philippines, Japanese in Japan, and natives of Guam in the United States and Guam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nonetheless, these particular immigrants who had this syndrome were about 33 years old and seemingly healthy and all but one of the Laotian Hmong refugees were men.&lt;ref name="Madrigal"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/09/the-dark-side-of-the-placebo-effect-when-intense-belief-kills/245065/|title=The Dark Side of the Placebo Effect: When Intense Belief Kills|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition appears to affect primarily young [[Hmong people|Hmong]] men from [[Laos]] (median age 33)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2105/AJPH.77.9.1187|journal=Am J Public Health|year=1987|volume=77|issue=9|pages=1187&amp;ndash;90|title=Sudden death in sleep of Laotian-Hmong refugees in Thailand: a case-control study|author=Munger RG|pmid=3618851|pmc=1647019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and northeastern Thailand (where the population are mainly of Laotian descent).&lt;ref name="Tatsanavivat"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Int J Epidemiol|year=1992|volume=21|issue=5|pages=904&amp;ndash;10|title=Sudden and unexplained deaths in sleep (Laitai) of young men in rural northeastern Thailand|vauthors=Tatsanavivat P, Chiravatkul A, Klungboonkrong V, Chaisiri S, Jarerntanyaruk L, Munger RG, Saowakontha S |pmid=1468851|doi=10.1093/ije/21.5.904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Int J Epidemiol|year=1993|volume=22|issue=1|pages=81&amp;ndash;7|title=Sudden unexplained death syndrome in north-east Thailand|vauthors=Tungsanga K, Sriboonlue P |pmid=8449651|doi=10.1093/ije/22.1.81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
[[File:Thailand Loei.png|thumb|Map of Thailand highlighting Loei Province]]
Laotian Hmongs were chosen for the study because they had one of the highest sudden death rates while sleeping in the United States. They were originally from Southern China and the highlands of North Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand. The location that was picked for this study was in [[Ban Vinai Refugee Camp|Ban Vinai]] in the [[Loei Province]], which is approximately 15 kilometers from the Lao border. This study took place between October 1982 and June 1983 as this syndrome became more of a relevant pressing issue. Ban Vinai was the location chosen because it had 33,000 refugees in 1982, which was the largest population of victims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because this syndrome was occurring most commonly in those particular men, researchers found it most beneficial and effective to study the population in which they migrated from instead of studying victims and populations in the U.S. Because of religious limitations the Hmong men in Ban Vinai were not allowed to receive autopsies. Therefore, the only results and research obtained were victims outside of their religion or geographical area. An interview was arranged with the next of kin who lived with the victim, witnessed the death, or found the body. The interviews were open ended and allowed the person who was next of kin to describe what they witnessed and what preceding events they thought were relevant to the victim's death. The interviewers also collected information such as illness history, the circumstances of the death, demographic background, and history of any sleep disturbances. A genealogy was then created which included all the relatives and their vital status and circumstances of death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Society and culture==
In a medical journal, the author suggested that the Hmong who died were killed by their own beliefs in the spiritual world, otherwise known as ''Nocturnal pressing spirit attacks''. In Indonesia it is called ''digeuton'', which translates to "pressed on" in English.&lt;ref name="Madrigal"/&gt; In China it is called ''b√®i gu«ê yƒÅ'' ({{zh|s=Ë¢´È¨ºÂéã|t=Ë¢´È¨ºÂ£ì|first=t}}) which translates to "crushed by a ghost" in English.&lt;ref name="Madrigal"/&gt; The Dutch call the presence a ''nachtmerrie'', the night-mare.&lt;ref name="Madrigal"/&gt; The "merrie" comes from the [[Middle Dutch]] ''mare'', an [[incubus]] who "lies on people's chests, suffocating them". This phenomenon is known among the Hmong people of Laos,&lt;ref name="Alder1995"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Soc Sci Med|year=1995|volume=40|issue=12|pages=1623&amp;ndash;9|title=Refugee stress and folk belief: Hmong sudden deaths|author=Adler SR|pmid=7660175|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(94)00347-V}}&lt;/ref&gt; who ascribe these deaths to a malign spirit, ''dab tsuam'' (pronounced "da cho"), said to take the form of a jealous woman.

During the 1970s and 1980s, when an outbreak of this syndrome began, many of the Southeast Asians were not able to worship properly due to the guerrilla war against the government of Laos with the United States. Hmong people believe that when they do not worship properly, do not perform religious ritual properly or forget to sacrifice, the ancestor spirits or the village spirits do not protect them, thus allowing the evil spirit to reach them. These attacks induce a nightmare that leads to sleep paralysis when the victim is conscious and experiencing pressure on the chest.&lt;ref name="Madrigal"/&gt; It is also common to have a [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] state that is out of sequence where there is a mix of brain states that are normally held separate.&lt;ref name="Madrigal"/&gt; After the war, the United States government scattered the Hmong across the country to 53 different cities.&lt;ref name="Madrigal"/&gt; Once these nightmare visitations began, a shaman was recommended for psychic protection from the spirits of their sleep.&lt;ref name="Madrigal"/&gt; However, scattered across 53 different cities, these victims had no access to any or the right shaman to protect them from this syndrome.

Hmong people believed that rejecting the role of becoming a [[shaman]], they are taken into the spirit world.

''Bangungot'' is depicted in the Philippines as a mythological creature called ''[[batibat]]'' or ''bangungot''. This [[hag]]-like creature sits on the victim's face or chest so as to immobilize and suffocate him. When this occurs, the victim usually experiences paralysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2390">The '''Teatro Goldoni''' of [[Florence]] was first opened in 1817 at the site of the former Annalena monastery in [[Oltrarno]], region of [[Tuscany]], Italy. The theater, dedicated to the playwright Carlo Goldoni, has a main facade on the narrow Via Santa Maria #15, it is near the corner with Via de Caldaie. 
[[File:Teatro goldoni firenze.JPG|thumb|Facade]]

==History==
The monastery took its name from Annalena Malatesta, the wife of [[Baldaccio d'Anghiari]], a 15th-century condottiero, known to [[Dante]], who was killed by treachery by a rival at the [[Palazzo Vecchio]]. Annalena after the subsequent death of her only son, converted her house into a convent. Within this convent, both the father of Cosimo I and Tommaso Soderini are said to have found temporary asylum from proscription.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5Wg5AAAAcAAJ Pianta geometrica della citt√† di Firenze], by Federico Fantozzi (1845), pages 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th-century, the monastery was vacated and the property expropriated. The theater producer Luigi Gargani obtained the property, and commissioned the design from architect [[Giuseppe del Rosso]]. On opening, the theater had 80 booths and sat 1600 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uz8etFvIdIoC Guida della citta di Firenze], Presso Antonio Campani, Florence (1830), page 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater was restored and reopened in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operadifirenze.it/teatro-goldoni-2/ Opera di Firenze], entry on Teatro Goldoni.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearby on Via della Fornace, Gargani had Del Rosso design a ''Teatro Diurno'' or ''Teatro L'Arena'', for daytime performances. This theater was sited where the Bilioni family once had a house. In 1356, this site was made into a monastery, under the Augustinian of San Giovanni Battista and Santa Chiara. The monastery was suppressed and converted to a theater in the Spring of 1818. It could house 1500 spectators in seven ground rows and two upper floors. In 1819, the church at the site became a school, and later the studio of the 19th-century sculptor Francesco Pozzi.&lt;ref&gt;Federico Fantozzi (1845), page 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Alexandra''', commonly known as '''the Alex''', is a [[theatre]] on Suffolk Queensway in [[Birmingham]], [[England]].

Construction of the theatre commenced in 1900 and was completed in 1901. The architects were Owen &amp; Ward&lt;ref name=foster&gt;{{cite book |last= Foster |first=Andy |title=Birmingham |series=Pevsner Architectural Guides |origyear=2005 |year=2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-10731-9 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the theatre was opened on 27 May 1901 as the ''Lyceum Theatre''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=1830&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=10114 |title=Chronology of Birmingham 1883 - 1950 |publisher=Birmingham City Council |accessdate=2008-04-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080311022624/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/GenerateContent?CONTENT_ITEM_ID=1830&amp;CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE=0&amp;MENU_ID=10114 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on John Bright Street. Initially it attracted few theatre goers and it was decided to bring in a star. For ten weeks from the middle of June 1901 [[Harry Arthur Saintsbury|H. A. Saintsbury]] trod the boards as the theatre's leading man, playing in [[costume drama]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mickie F.K. Fraser, ''Alexandra Theatre: the story of a popular playhouse'' (Cornish Brothers, 1948), pp. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of disappointingly low returns the new theatre was sold to Lester Collingwood for ¬£4,000, who renamed it the ''Alexandra Theatre'' on 22 December 1902.&lt;ref name=kemp&gt;{{cite book |last=Kemp |first=David |title=The Pleasures and Treasures of Britain |year=1996 |publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd. |isbn=1-55002-159-1 |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collingwood was killed in a road traffic accident in 1910 and was succeeded by Leon Salberg, who died in his office at the theatre in 1938. His ghost is said to inhabit the theatre.&lt;ref name=kemp/&gt; Other ghostly sightings include that by a cleaner of a woman dressed in grey in 1987.&lt;ref name=kemp/&gt;

The theatre was rebuilt with a fine [[Art Deco]] auditorium in 1935 to a design by Roland Satchwell.&lt;ref name=foster/&gt; Upon Leon Salberg's death, Derek Salberg took over the running of the theatre. The Salberg family ran the theatre from 1911 to 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barker |first=Clive |author2=Simon Trussler  |title=New Theatre Quarterly 62 |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-78902-8 |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[World War II]], the theatre became well patronised by the local population - in 1950 85% of season ticket holders lived within the boundaries of Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Birmingham and Its Regional Setting: A Scientific Survey |last=Kinvig |first=R.H. |others=British Association for the Advancement of Science |year=1950 |publisher=Local Executive Committee |page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the main entrance was originally situated on John Bright Street, a new main entrance block was built on Suffolk Street between 1967-1969 to a design by the [[John Madin|John Madin Design Group]], with a wide bridge linking the two - from the inside, the appearance is that of a single building.&lt;ref name=foster/&gt; Satchwell's interior was refurbished in 1992 by the [[Seymour Harris Partnership]].&lt;ref name=foster/&gt; The Alex was sold to Apollo Leisure in the 1990s. Derek Salberg's autobiography "''Much Ado About Theatre''" had its foreword written by [[Laurence Olivier]]. Under Leon Salberg, the Alex was famous for its [[pantomime]]s such as "''[[Mother Goose]]''".

The theatre currently seats 1,371 and hosts a busy programme of touring [[drama]], [[West End theatre|West End shows]] and stand-up comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/stage/venues/a_f/alex.shtml |title=The Alexandra Theatre |publisher=BBC Birmingham |accessdate=2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the home of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] between 1990 and 1997.

[[Neville Chamberlain]] delivered a speech at the theatre on 13 October 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rifkind |first=Simon Hirsch |title=The Basic Equities of the Palestine Problem |year=1977 |publisher=Ayer Publishing |isbn=0-405-10279-8 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dad's Army]]'' star [[Arthur Lowe]] collapsed because of a [[stroke]] in his dressing room in the theatre before a performance of ''Home at Seven'', and later died in hospital on 15 April 1982 aged 66.

==Recent history==
On 7 August 1995, the then Alexandra Theatre was taken over by the multi-national organisation the Apollo Leisure Group. The new owners who ran many West End theatres brought many large scale [[West End theatre|West End]] productions to the Alex including ''[[Copacabana (musical)|Copacabana]]'', ''[[Great Expectations]]'', ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' and ''[[Summer Holiday (1963 film)#Stage adaptations|Summer Holiday]]'' starring Darren Day. A critically acclaimed production of ''[[West Side Story]]'' transferred to the West End for a successful run.

Under the ownership of Apollo Leisure, the Alex saw major investment including improvements to the stage area and front of house areas, this then enabled the theatre to stage first-rate productions including two productions from Cameron Mackintosh, ''[[Oliver!]]'' starring [[Gary Wilmot]], and ''[[Les Mis√©rables (musical)|Les Mis√©rables]]'' - the first productions to try out the new facilities.

In 1999 the Apollo Leisure Group was bought by American entertainment company SFX Entertainment for around ¬£160 million.  Under SFX management the theatre saw increased entertainment value, still welcoming West End productions such as ''[[Doctor Dolittle]]'', and in Christmas 2000 saw the return of [[pantomime]] to the theatre, with a sell out season of ''[[Peter Pan]]'' starring [[Leslie Grantham]] and [[Joe Pasquale]]. 
In 2001, SFX merged with [[Clear Channel Entertainment]], making them the largest UK theatre operator, including three West End theatres. Under the ownership of Clear Channel the theatre continued to provide and attract a range of entertainment, including musicals, comedy, plays, opera and concerts.

Comedians including [[Stewart Lee]], [[Seann Walsh]], [[Jack Dee]] and [[Micky Flanagan]] have all performed at the theatre in recent years.

In January 2006 the Alexandra Theatre changed management once again, to be managed by [[Live Nation]], a company that specialised in concert promotion and large venue operations. It is now owned by the [[Ambassador Theatre Group]], and after a minor refurbishment the group renamed the theatre the ''New Alexandra Theatre''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alexandratheatre.org.uk/content_venue.asp?CategoryID=4004&amp;VenueID=87&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September 2018, the theatre was relaunched as ''The Alexandra'' following a ¬£650,000 refurbishment and corporate re-brand to the venue which will be unveiled in October 2018 for the opening of the [[Motown: The Musical|''Motown The Musical'']] UK tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atgtickets.com/venues/alexandra-theatre-birmingham/tab2/|title=Alexandra Theatre Birmingham - Official Alexandra Theatre Tickets|website=www.atgtickets.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Their Hearts Caught Fire''' is a British charity project that was founded in the UK in 2007 to raise money for [[Cancer Research UK]]. The project is based around an album of covers of songs by [[Dogs D'Amour]], recorded by fans of the band, and the name of the project was taken from the first line of the Dogs song ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄúThe Prettiest Girl In The World‚Äù‚Äô‚Äô.

==Origins of the project==
The project was conceived by Bruce Cunnington.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribute.heretherebedragons.co.uk/ Their Hearts Caught Fire - Order Now!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, inspired by an earlier Dogs D‚ÄôAmour tribute album (1999, Bullet Proof Poems &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestreetwalkincheetahs.com/dogsdamour.html Bullet Proof Poems&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) Bruce discussed with a small group of fans the idea of producing a ‚Äúby the fans, for the fans‚Äù album of acoustic Dogs D‚ÄôAmour covers, however the time and cost involved prevented this from becoming a reality. By early 2007, with the rise to prominence of the internet download as a method of releasing music, the idea resurfaced, this time with the added motivation that it would be a way of paying tribute to Trace Warnaby, a well-known and much-loved figure in rock fan circles, who had died in December 2006 and who also inspired the Mad As Badgers fundraising project for the same cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knightdigitalarts.co.uk/badgers/ www.madasbadgers.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Tyla, vocalist and songwriter of Dogs D‚ÄôAmour, gave his blessing to the project, even re-recording one song himself under the alias of Gabriel O‚ÄôKeefe.

==Promotion and awareness==
The project was publicised mainly by the fans themselves, using the internet. Fans‚Äô messageboards carried links to the Hearts website. The group became a visible presence on [[Myspace]], with those involved actively posting bulletins and banners on their own pages to spread word of the project. A group was set up on [[Facebook]], and Trig.com also featured a page for the Hearts project.

*How Do You Fall In Love Again? - Their Hearts Caught Fire

===How Do You Fall In Love Again?===
In August 2007, members of the Hearts team gathered at a studio just outside London to record their version of ‚ÄúHow Do You Fall In Love Again?‚Äù. &lt;ref&gt;http://tribute.heretherebedragons.co.uk/news.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Those who had some musical talent played drums, guitar, and bass. Those with enthusiasm gathered for a group singalong of the chorus. Each member then recorded a solo lead vocal track. The song was then mixed by Jason Knight, and received its debut airing on the project‚Äôs Myspace page on 29 August 2007, with the promo video ‚Äì filmed on the day of recording by Darren Stockford ‚Äì being shown for the first time on 8 September 2007, also on the project‚Äôs Myspace page. While the original plan was for an internet-only release for the album, a limited edition CD was also released to increase the amount of money that could be raised through the project.

==Other fundraising==
The project, fortunately and coincidentally, was in full swing when Tyla announced that he would be touring the UK at the end of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myspace.com/tylaandthedogsdamour MySpace.com - Tyla The Dogs Damour - Wolves, UK - Rock / Gothique / Blues - www.myspace.com/tylaandthedogsdamour&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The fundraising efforts were focussed on the Norwich date of the tour, which was organised and promoted by a member of the Hearts team. On earlier dates of the tour, raffle tickets were sold at the merchandise stand, the draw taking place at Norwich with the top prizes being a piece of original artwork, painted and donated by Tyla and, as the fundraising was all about raising money for Cancer Research, a mammogram at a Harley Street clinic. Other prizes include t-shirts and signed memorabilia, while several fans also donated items from their own record collections.

==Burning Hearts Brighton Bash==
The August Bank Holiday weekend of 2008 saw an all-day fundraising concert take place in Brighton, once again with Cancer Research UK as the beneficiaries. The event, which was christened "The Burning Hearts Brighton Bash", featured several of the bands who had recorded tracks for the album and was headlined by The Gasoline Queens, who had made up part of the most recent Dogs D'Amour line-up. Fundraising activities on the day included a raffle and a BBQ, which saw members of the bands who appeared on the day cooking burgers and hot dogs for the fans who were present.

'''Thomas Gresham Kirby-Green''' (27 February 1918 ‚Äì 29 March 1944) was a British [[Royal Air Force]] officer, the pilot of a [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber, who was taken prisoner during the [[Second World War]]. He took part in the 'Great Escape' from [[Stalag Luft III]] in March 1944, but was one of the men recaptured and subsequently executed by the [[Gestapo]].

==Pre-war life==
Kirby-Green was born in [[Dowa, Malawi|Dowa]], [[Nyasaland]] where his father Sir William Kirby-Green was the British District Governor. His father was upcountry at the time of his birth and found a baby abandoned in the bush at the same time as his son was born. He rescued the child, named him "Putti" and brought him up as a second son.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.30&lt;/ref&gt; After growing up in Africa, Kirby-Green was sent to boarding school in England at [[Dover College]] where he became a house prefect and a member of the rugby team. On leaving school in 1935 he lived with his parents in [[Tangier]] and gained a private pilot's license prior to joining the [[Royal Air Force]]. Kirby-Green was commissioned on 24 August 1936,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37693|page=5940|date=15 September 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; he trained as a service pilot at No. 8 Flying Training School [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] and joined [[No. 216 Squadron RAF]] flying transport aircraft in Egypt from 27 May 1937 before being confirmed as a [[pilot officer]] on 29 June 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34413|page=4180|date=29 June 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he regularly sailed to Tangier to visit his parents whilst on leave.&lt;ref&gt;UK, Outward Passenger Lists, 1890‚Äì1960 &amp; Inward Passenger Lists, 1878‚Äì1960&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vickers Wellington Mk2.jpg|thumb|right|The Merlin-engined Wellington Mark II. This aircraft belongs to [[No. 104 Squadron RAF|No. 104 Sqn.]]]]
In January 1938 he was transferred to [[No. 99 Squadron RAF]] at [[RAF Mildenhall]] and with the squadron converted to the new [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber later that year. During 1938 he competed in the RAF Athletics Championships representing the base and competing against [[Ian Cross (RAF officer)|Ian Cross]] representing [[RAF Marham]] neither knowing that they would both be involved in the "Great Escape" in 1944.  He was promoted [[flying officer]] on 29 January 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34600|page=1214|date=21 February 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==War service==
In January 1940, after completing a gunnery course, he joined [[No. 9 Squadron RAF]] to fly [[Vickers Wellington]]s operationally from [[RAF Honington]] and by the end of July 1940 he had completed 27 operations.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.31&lt;/ref&gt; That September he was rested and posted to the newly formed [[No. 311 Squadron RAF]] a Czech squadron, as a flight instructor. He always wore Czech insignia on his [[RAF]] uniform to honour his Czech friends. Kirby-Green was promoted [[flight lieutenant]] on 3 September 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34989|supp=y|page=6493|date=12 November 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of 1940 he married Maria Dorothea Diane Hayman in south-west London and they set up home at [[Hamerton]] near [[Huntingdon]].&lt;ref&gt;England &amp; Wales, Marriage Register, Dec Quarter 1940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Probate Calendar, 1944 ‚Äì TG K-Green&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1941 he completed a highly successful instructional tour with the Czechs being posted away to [[No. 40 Squadron RAF]] for a second tour of ops.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.31&lt;/ref&gt; His commanding officer was [[Percy Pickard|"Pick" Pickard]] DSO DFC. On 10 September 1941 he participated in a bombing attack on [[Turin]], Italy and was the only pilot of the squadron to reach and bomb the target due to the terrible weather conditions. He was promoted acting [[squadron leader]] and flight commander and received a [[Mention in Despatches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35284|supp=y|page=5572|date=23 September 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prisoner of war==
At 01:06 hours on the morning of 17 October 1941 he took off from [[RAF Alconbury]] on his 37th operation flying a [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington Mark Ic bomber]] (serial number "Z8862", squadron codes BL-B) to bomb factories in [[Duisburg]] but Kirby-Green's aircraft was shot down. All of the rest of the crew were killed and Kirby-Green became a prisoner of war.&lt;ref&gt;Chorley (1993), p.163&lt;/ref&gt; [[Percy Pickard]] flew down to break the news to his wife and said that he was sure that Kirby-Green would be a prisoner of war and then on 16 November 1941 [[William Joyce]], [[Lord Haw Haw]] the American born Irish-British Nazi collaborator broadcasting from Berlin made specific reference to the capture of [[Squadron Leader]] Kirby-Green.  By this time he had passed through interrogation camp at [[Dulag Luft]] and was in [[Stalag Luft I]] at [[Barth, Germany|Barth]] where he was a colourful and noisy character.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004), p.57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.32&lt;/ref&gt;
As a prisoner of war Kirby-Green received exotic parcels from family in Tangier with fruits, nuts, gramophone records of Latin music and bright clothing. He and Johnny Stower gave classes teaching the Spanish language. After transfer to [[Stalag Luft III]] he became more closely associated with [[Roger Bushell]] who was Big-X running the escape activities. Bushell recruited him as the senior security officer for the escape committee. He became Big-S and introduced a "duty-pilot" scheme which involved maintaining a watch on all German activities.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), pp.91 and 114&amp;ndash;115&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an enthusiastic tunneller,&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.36&lt;/ref&gt; and collated all available information on Spain, anything which might assist an escaper heading for that frontier.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004), p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

=='Great Escape'==
The original escape plan teamed [[Gordon Kidder]] up with Dick Churchill to travel posing as Rumanian woodcutters, but after Churchill was removed to another camp, Kidder was paired with deeply sun-tanned Tom Kirby-Green,&lt;ref&gt;Burgess (1990), p.142&lt;/ref&gt; who had been in charge of security for organizer [[Roger Bushell]]s "escape committee"; they would instead pose as Spanish labourers.&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Kirby-Green being buried by a cave-in in the tunnel,&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004), p.174&lt;/ref&gt; he and Kidder were amongst the first 24 from the total of 76 men who escaped the prison camp on the night of 24‚Äì25 March 1944, in the escape now known as "[[Stalag Luft III|the Great Escape]]".&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), pp.92&amp;ndash;93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/squadron-leader-thomas-kirby-green/  TAG Archives ‚Äì The Great Escape]&lt;/ref&gt; The pair cleared the tunnel exit before the alarm was sounded and made it to the local railway station, where they were almost exposed when questioned by a female member of the prison camp censor staff. She involved a policeman, who was convinced by their mixture of Spanish and broken German and let them go.

They boarded the train for [[Breslau]],&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), pp.226&amp;ndash;227&lt;/ref&gt; where they then changed trains for Czechoslovakia, hoping for a further connection to Yugoslavia or Hungary where Kirby-Green had friends.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.53&lt;/ref&gt; But after crossing the border they were recaptured at [[Hodonin]] in southern Moravia (close to the Austrian frontier) on 28 March 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll (2004), p.204&lt;/ref&gt; While held at [[Zlin]] prison they were the only prisoners interrogated physically and violently.&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.263&lt;/ref&gt;
The two escapers were taken away by the [[Zlin]] [[Gestapo]] in two cars which headed out onto the [[Breslau]] road,&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.spectator.co.uk/2013/03/daring-to-do/  The Spectator ‚Äì reconstruction of the executions]&lt;/ref&gt; and shot near Mahrisch Ostrau (later known as Moravska Ostrava and now just as [[Ostrava]]), their bodies being cremated in the local crematorium there.

'''''[title of show]''''' is a one-act [[musical theatre|musical]], with music and lyrics by [[Jeff Bowen]] and a book by [[Hunter Bell]].  The show chronicles its own creation as an entry in the [[New York Musical Theatre Festival]], and follows the struggles of the author and composer/lyricist and their two actress friends during the initial brief (three-week) creative period, along with subsequent events leading up to the show's production.

''[title of show]'' was chosen for production by the Musical Theatre Festival and premiered there, in September 2004, in [[New York City]].  It later ran [[off-Broadway]] at the [[Vineyard Theatre]] in 2006, earning a second limited run the same year, then played at Broadway's [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]] in 2008 for 13 previews and 102 regular performances.    Writer/stars Bowen and Bell, as well as director [[Michael Berresse]] all won [[Obie Award]]s for their work on the off-Broadway production, and Bell was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical|Best Book of a Musical]].&lt;ref name="tonynoms"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news-briefs.ew.com/2009/05/05/tony-award-nomi/ |title='Billy Elliot' leads Tony nominations|last=Bierly|first=Mandi|date=May 5, 2009|work=EW.com|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical spawned a recurring [[video blog]] about the show's journey to Broadway called ''The [title of show] Show''.

==History and productions==
''[title of show]'' was conceived by friends Bowen and Bell during the spring of 2004 after Bell received an announcement for the inaugural [[New York Musical Theatre Festival]]. With the deadline just three weeks away, Bell began drafting the script with Bowen writing the lyrics and music.  Due to the severe time constraints, and because the Festival required only the submission of a script plus four songs, Bowen wrote most lyrics without any accompanying melody, planning to finish the songs later.  Nevertheless, many of these lyrics have remained intact through several incarnations and revisions to the show.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Bowen and Bell, determined to write an original musical rather than adapt an existing play or movie, discovered almost immediately that their conversations about what to write were more interesting than what they were actually writing.  As the idea to document the creation of the show itself ("a musical about two guys writing a musical about two guys writing a musical") became clearer,  Bell and Bowen expanded the script based on their writing experiences with friends [[Susan Blackwell]] and [[Heidi Blickenstaff]]. ''[title of show]'' has since become a [[post-modern]] work-in-progress, with updates and changes to each new production reflecting the circumstances the cast and the show have experienced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  Larry Pressgrove is the musical director and orchestrator in all productions to date.

===Early performances===
{{More citations needed|date=July 2008}}
The first three performances of ''[title of show]'', at the [[Manhattan Theatre Source]] in the summer of 2004, were produced by Laura Camien.&lt;ref&gt;Bixby, Suzanne.[http://www.speakeasystage.com/doc.php?section=showpage&amp;page=titleofshow Interview] speakeasystage.com, retrieved December 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The cast included Bowen, Bell, Blackwell, and Stacia Fernandez, playing the role of "Stacia".  Bowen and Bell convinced several Broadway stars to participate in a recurring plot device by leaving recorded phone messages rejecting offers to star in the show.  Messages featured in the Theatre Source and Festival performances included [[Idina Menzel]], [[Marin Mazzie]], [[Sutton Foster]] and [[Emily Skinner]].

The production premiered at the 2004 [[New York Musical Theatre Festival]] on September 22, 2004 (also produced by Camien), at the Belt Theatre, and ran for six performances as scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Jena Tesse.[http://broadwayworld.com/article/NYMF_REVIEW_title_of_show_20040928 "Review:&amp;#91;title of show&amp;#93;"] broadwayworld.com, September 28, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Heidi Blickenstaff replaced Fernandez, who had accepted the understudy role to [[Beth Leavel]] in the Broadway production of ''[[The Drowsy Chaperone]].''  While her character's name remained "Stacia" for the Festival performances, thereafter it became "Heidi", and the role was modified to reflect Blickenstaff's experiences while helping to expand and evolve the show.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with director Michael Berresse for Downstage Center XM28 (Broadway Radio), August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A year of expansion and revision followed.  [[Kevin McCollum]] agreed to produce ''[title of show]'' for professional presentation after seeing it performed at the Festival.  Five new songs were added: "Monkeys and Playbills", "What Kind of Girl is She?", "Festival Medley/September Song", "Secondary Characters" and "Nine People's Favorite Thing".  "The Wall", originally sung by Jeff and Stacia at the Festival, was rewritten as a solo for Heidi with new lyrics, and a new name, "A Way Back to Then."  Changes to the book included the addition of the conflict between Susan and Heidi (as introduced by "What Kind of Girl Is She?") and the combined music and scenes "Awkward Photo Shoot" and "Change It, Don't Change It."   Both reflected the tension among the cast members that had begun to set in since the Festival's performance and their uncertainty about an off-Broadway run.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

After several performances at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]] in [[Waterford, CT]], six [[off-off Broadway]] performances were staged at [[Ars Nova Theater|Ars Nova]] in New York City in September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;BWW News Desk.[http://broadwayworld.com/article/NYMF_Hit_title_of_show_Plays_Ars_Nova_Sept_1127_20050823 "NYMF Hit &amp;#91;title of show&amp;#93; Plays Ars Nova, Sept. 11-27"] broadwayworld.com, August 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Phone messages in the Ars Nova production were left by [[Marin Mazzie]] and [[Emily Skinner]] again, with new messages from [[Amy Spanger]] and [[Victoria Clark]].  The success of these performances led to an offer by the [[Vineyard Theatre]] of a limited [[off-Broadway]] run.

===Off-Broadway===
''[title of show]'' was performed at the Vineyard Theatre from February 26, 2006 to April 24, 2006 as part of the theatre's regular season line-up, followed by an extension of the production from July 14, 2006 through October 1, 2006.&lt;ref name=Kent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=9144|title=BWW TV: That's Kentertainment ¬ó '[title of show]' and more|first=That's|last=Kentertainment!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christine Ebersole]] lent her voice to one of the phone messages.  The production won three [[Obie Award]] Special Citations for its writer/stars and director.

A performance was scheduled to play in [[San Francisco]] in 2008 but was canceled because of time constraints in moving the show to Broadway by July 2008.  The show's transfer to Broadway is chronicled in "the ''[title of show]'' show" video blogs on YouTube and on the show's official web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titleofshow.com|title=[title of show] - Official Site - Get Tickets|website=www.titleofshow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadway===
The musical began previews on Broadway at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]] on July 5, 2008 and officially opened on July 17. It closed October 12, 2008 after 13 previews and 102 performances. It was produced by McCollum, Roy Miller (producer of ''The Drowsy Chaperone''), The Vineyard Theatre, Laura Camien and [[Kris Stewart (director and producer)|Kris Stewart]], the founder of the New York Musical Theatre Festival.

The entire off-Broadway cast continued in the same roles, and Berresse continued as director.  Added to the list of phone messages in the Broadway production was the voice of [[Patti LuPone]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/theater/04arts-LITTLESHOWBI_BRF.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin ''The New York Times''], April 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/116496.html "An Original Musical: [title of show&amp;#93; Will Open on Broadway in July", ''Playbill'',] April 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Scenic design was by [[Neil Patel (Designer)|Neil Patel]], costumes by Chase Tyler and lighting by [[Ken Billington]] and Jason Kantrowitz.

==Original cast==
The cast for the New York Musical Theatre Festival, off-Broadway, Broadway, and national tour productions has remained the same:
*[[Hunter Bell]] ‚Äì Hunter
*[[Susan Blackwell]] ‚Äì Susan
*[[Heidi Blickenstaff]] ‚Äì Heidi
*[[Jeff Bowen]] ‚Äì Jeff

Larry Pressgrove, the arranger and musical director, has a minor speaking role as himself ("Larry") while playing musical accompaniment at an on-stage keyboard.

The show also features recorded vocal cameo appearances by several well-known Broadway actors, playing themselves: [[Kerry Butler]], [[Marin Mazzie]], [[Victoria Clark]], [[Christine Ebersole]], [[Sutton Foster]], [[Patti LuPone]], and [[Emily Skinner]].

Standbys for the both the original off-Broadway and Broadway productions were Courtney Balan and Benjamin Howes.

==Synopsis==
As the show opens ("Untitled Opening Number") Jeff and Hunter are discussing the possibility of entering the upcoming [[New York Musical Theatre Festival]].  The submissions deadline is only three weeks away, but they long to make their mark in the theatre world ("Two Nobodies In New York").  Jeff laments his lack of inspiration.  When his blank writing pad begins to look like Hunter, ideas begin to flow ("An Original Musical").

The two men recruit their friends Susan and Heidi to help with the project.  As the guys battle writer's block, the girls become voices in their heads, making suggestions.  "Writing should feel easy," Susan says, "like a monkey driving a speedboat" ("Monkeys and Playbills").  Excitement mounts; if the show is a hit, they could replace the four ugly mismatched chairs on the set with chairs covered in diamonds. Hunter even ponders winning a [[Tony Award|Tony]] ("The Tony Award Song")‚Äîbut Jeff reminds him that they have already cut the song he is in the midst of singing.  Jeff and Hunter discuss their ambition to write and compose for a living ("Part of It All").

Doubts and insecurities surface.  Heidi wonders what she has gotten herself into, and Hunter worries that they are just stringing sketches and novelty songs together, that they need something "a little meatier" ("I Am Playing Me"). Susan and Heidi become suspicious of each other ("What Kind Of Girl Is She?").  Hunter and Jeff are getting increasingly discouraged: What were they thinking?  Will they even finish?  Susan says the "vampires" are devouring their confidence and creativity, and they cannot let that happen ("Die, Vampire, Die!"). Reenergized, the men finish the show, and the ensemble tackles the festival paperwork ("Filling Out The Form").  Since the deadline is upon them and nobody can come up with a killer name for the show, they decide to leave the title-of-show field untouched‚Äîwhich makes ''[title of show]'' the name of their show.  "What if they don't pick it?" Hunter worries.   "Well, that'll be Act 2," says Jeff.

But their little three-week-old musical is chosen.  During the festival the four revel in their six performances, and lament that it all must end ("September Song").  They note, as a bonus, that "fancy industry people" are in the audience.   Heidi and Susan reconcile their differences and bond over their supporting roles ("Secondary Characters").

As plans progress toward taking the musical to Broadway, things begin to unravel:  The four friends argue over the wisdom of making changes to the script, or leaving it alone ("Change It/Don't Change It").  Hunter and Jeff, after contacting numerous famous Broadway actresses, finally get a positive response from [[Sutton Foster]], and Hunter suggests casting her in Heidi's role to generate some "buzz".  Tensions build, and everything finally boils over at a publicity photo shoot ("Awkward Photo Shoot").  Heidi is upset that Hunter wants to replace her, Susan is concerned about profit-sharing, Jeff is letting the "vampires" get to him again, Larry (the keyboardist) feels snubbed because he's not in any of the press photos, and Hunter lashes out at all of them.  Everyone leaves in a huff.

That night, Hunter breaks the ice by apologizing.  More apologies follow, and the four wax nostalgic over younger, happier, less complicated days ("A Way Back To Then"). They now understand that the show must sink or swim as it is‚Äîwith the five of them, without a "bankable" star‚Äîbecause their relationship and the quality of their creation are more important to them than commercial success; they would rather be "...nine people's favorite thing than a hundred people's ninth-favorite thing" ("Nine People's Favorite Thing").  "Let's just put it out there and see what happens," Jeff says‚Äîwhich, of course, they have just finished doing‚Äîso the show ends ("Finale").

At curtain call, the four ugly chairs rise into the rafters and return encrusted in diamonds.

===Cast recording===
The 2006 original Off-Broadway cast recording was released by Ghostlight Records, an imprint of [[Sh-K-Boom Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sh-k-boom.com/TitleOfShow.shtml|title=Sh-K-Boom cast album order page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It includes the same musical numbers listed above, except that only "September Song" is performed from the "Montage" parts, followed by "Secondary Characters" (sung by Heidi and Susan) instead of "Change It, Don't Change It" and "Awkward Photo Shoot", which are not on the cast recording.

There are two bonus tracks on the recording:
*"''[title of show]''" (Company)
*"Ground Beef In A Cup" (Heidi, with Susan).  This song was included in early versions of the show, but the melody became "What Kind of Girl Is She?"  It is a hidden track, combined into one track with ''[title of show]'' on the online download of the album, and after 15 second of silence on the cast album.

[[File:Cheyenne on ttoss.jpg|thumb|[[Cheyenne Jackson]] (center) on ''the [title of show] show'' with Hunter Bell (left) and [[Jeff Bowen]] (right)]]

''The [title of show] show'' is a video blog by the creators of ''[title of show]''. It documents the musical's  progress to Broadway.  Guest actors [[Barrett Foa]], [[Sean Palmer]], [[Sierra Boggess]], [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], [[Kerry Butler]], [[Lea Michele]], [[Gideon Glick]], [[Jonathan Groff]], [[Ann Harada]], director of ''[title of show]'' [[Michael Berresse]] and [[Cheyenne Jackson]] appear on the ''[title of show] show".

===Episode list===
The titles of the show's episodes reflect the original cast recording track listing.

====Episode 1: Untitled Pilot Episode====

Jeff and Hunter, appearing largely in character, excitedly announce that ''[title of show]'' is going to Broadway.  This episode sets the precedent for future episodes; Jeff wears his costume from the original off-Broadway production and Hunter wears a promotional shirt from a random Broadway show. The episode chronicles the creation of the ''[title of show]'' show and includes clips of Jeff composing the show's musical theme at the piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrqFDczlobQ|title=Pilot Episode -the [title of show] show|first=|last=titleofshow|date=12 August 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Episode 2: Two Nobodies Look For a Theatre====

Split into two parts, Jeff and Hunter begin searching for a Broadway theatre and Jeff creates the [TOS]ability Board.  Susan checks in from her dressing room on the set of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', her first appearance on the show after performing an unprepared search for a theater on foot in [[Shubert Alley]].  Upon returning to the apartment, Heidi messages Hunter and Jeff on [[iChat]] and recommends that the group perform out of town before mounting a Broadway production.

This episode introduced the duct tape motif of ''[title of show]'' publicity and the first playing of the opening sequence Jeff began composing in Episode 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8ItdjWnXpA|title=Episode 2 - Part 1 "the [title of show] show"|first=|last=titleofshow|date=31 August 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPJkhQPJB_Y|title=Episode 2 - Part 2 "the [title of show] show"|first=|last=titleofshow|date=31 August 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Episode 3: It's an Original Musical====

This episode begins in the tradition of the ''[title of show]'''s self-aware nature and immediately exposes the back stage conversations of the actors after filming Episode 2.

Hunter and Jeff begin to wonder if people will understand what ''[title of show]'' is.  Susan, who has apparently been in the room during the filming of Episode 2, has prepared a comedic video spoof of a 1980s instructional video that explains the show's concept. Larry Pressgrove appears for the first time as Constantine, a co-worker in Jim and Barry's office.

The instructional video is interrupted so Jeff can update the [TOS]ability Board.  Also, Jeff introduces his ''[title of show]'' Showcial Network Chart which records the status of ''[title of show]'' on Broadwayworld.com's Showcial Network.  Hunter introduces his own chart called "Hunter's Chart of Jeff's Charts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyRYzu0GsYI|title=Episode 3 - "the [title of show] show"|first=|last=titleofshow|date=12 September 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Episode 4: There's a Monkey in My Playbill====

Hunter and Jeff begin perusing a gift bag from "Broadway on Broadway" and decide to attend the annual Broadway [[flea market]].  While Jeff shows his new [[Playbill]]s to Susan, Heidi arrives at the apartment.  After a quick joyous reunion, the group decides to hit the town "Heidi-Style."  During a montage of the day, Jeff updates the [TOS]ability Board.  After a long day, Jeff, Hunter, Heidi and Susan relax and imagine how ''[title of show]'' could play in different US cities in a series of television show spoofs. Jeff is seen out of costume for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtJ0RY5w4Vk|title=Episode 4 - "the [title of show] show"|first=|last=titleofshow|date=29 September 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Episode 5: Part of It All====

In the writers' room, Hunter, Jeff, Heidi, Susan and Larry sit around a table and discuss what Episode 5 will be about.  As a running joke, every time the city ''[title of show]'' will play in is said, a sound effect blocks it out. The team decide that parodies are the best ways to create exposure for ''[title of show]''. The discussion is interrupted by Jeff who updates the Showcial Network Chart and by Hunter parodying the [[YouTube]] video [[Leave Britney Alone]].  Jeff interrupts his own sequence to update the [TOS]ability Board and is again interrupted by Hunter who parodies the [[YouTube]] video of [[Miss South Carolina Teen USA|Miss Teen South Carolina]].

Heidi enters the scene and accidentally mentions that the out of town trial will take place in [[San Francisco]]. Susan then confesses to the audience that because no arrangements have been finalized, the city the out of town tryout had not yet been revealed. This episode has brief cameos from actors [[Sean Palmer]] and [[Barrett Foa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huM1bM61ijE|title=Episode 5 - "the [title of show] show"|first=|last=titleofshow|date=28 October 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Episode 6: We Are Playing We====

Hunter and Jeff consider that should ''[title of show]'' become a Broadway hit, they would need to cast replacements for the original cast upon on whom the characters in the show are based.

A musical sequence begins in which many Broadway actors sing a refrain from the show. Several actors play Hunter and Jeff in brief sequences that interrupt the musical number.  Jeff introduces his new chart, Jeff's Playbill Needs, which lists Playbills he needs for his collection. Hunter, played by [[Ann Harada]] interrupts to add this chart to Hunter's Chart of Jeff's Charts.

The episode includes a very brief closing cameo from [[Nathan Lane]] and [[David Hyde Pierce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5MgEwRytUU|title=Episode 6 - "the [title of show] show"|first=|last=titleofshow|date=4 December 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Episode 7: What Kind of Show is She?====

After agreeing there should be no more cameos via telephone, Hunter and Jeff prepare to meet at a planned press conference. Hunter has the responsibility of telling Cheyenne Jackson that he is no longer in the show.  Jackson, enraged, exits the room.

Heidi and Susan begin a fake press conference that parodies the [[news crawl]] and logo of [[CNN]]. Jeff arrives late to the conference and announces there will be no pre-Broadway tryout and the show will be sent directly to Broadway.

Back in the apartment, Jeff and Hunter draw attention to the fact that they have implied the out of town tryout would be in San Francisco, which was canceled due to timing issues. Jeff updates the [TOS]ability Board and notes that every Broadway theatre is booked for the season but they still hope to perform on Broadway in spring 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgdLcI45K2I|title=Episode 7 - "the [title of show] show"|first=|last=titleofshow|date=29 January 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to copyright infringement, the sound was turned off by YouTube. It was re-uploaded on February 23, 2010 with sound. The video without sound is still on the show's channel.

====Episode 8: It's Time Vampire, It's Time====
This episode features no introduction although the show's theme is played at the beginning. It begins with the end credits from the end to the beginning. A baton relay race is held by the cast of ''[title of show]'' involving a mysterious package that has been delivered to Jeff. Over twenty minutes earlier, Susan hands the package to Jeff who runs through [[Times Square]] to the Lyceum Theatre or The Producing Office to view its contents. Over thirty minutes earlier, Mindy gives Susan the package who runs to give it to Jeff, but on the way is attacked by ninjas. After a fierce battle, Susan defeats them and finds that one is [[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]] star [[Jonathan Groff]]. After finding that Groff cannot get her tickets, she kills him and finishes her trip in a restaurant where she eats and forgets to give Jeff the package. Nearly 40 minutes earlier, Larry gives Mindy singing lessons for a back-up vocal part in "Die, Vampire, Die" when a dog, Olive, gives him the package which he immediately gives to Mindy for delivery.  Mindy runs through New York where she collides with [[Cheyenne Jackson]]. Avoiding Jackson, Mindy delivers the package to Susan. One hour earlier, Heidi sits in her dressing room preparing for a performance of [[The Little Mermaid]]. Hunter arrives out of breath and gives Heidi the package which she ties onto Olive's collar. Olive runs down the sidewalk to Larry's apartment building where she meets [[John Tartaglia]] in the elevator.  Not caring what Tartaglia has to say, Olive leaves the elevator and delivers the package to Larry.  Thirty-five minutes earlier, Hunter sits at his breakfast table when he suddenly gets dressed and retrieves the package from a shoe-box in his kitchen.  He runs into midtown New York City passing actor [[Barrett Foa]] on the way to Heidi's dressing room.  Twenty minutes earlier, Hunter stretches outside his apartment building and brings in a newspaper. While reading the newspaper, Hunter sees that the ''New York Times'' has announced ''[title of show]'' is going to Broadway.  He retrieves the shoe-box which is labeled "in case of [broadway] open."  The entire sequence of events is played forwards very quickly and Jeff opens the package which contains the ''[title of show]'' sticker for his [TOS]ability board.  The cast gathers around to see that the show will be playing at the Lyceum Theatre beginning on July 5. The closing credits announce the dates and ticket availability for the Broadway production and asks the viewer to "tell 9 people" in a reference to the song "Nine People's Favorite Thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CeN8Iw9X2k|title=Episode 8 - "the [title of show] show"|first=|last=titleofshow|date=4 April 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was later re-uploaded, although the original video is still on their channel.

====Episode 9: Fillin' Out the Frrrrm====

Jeff is working in his kitchen preparing for Broadway when Hunter calls him. They tease one another about their success. They discuss [[American Idol]] and realize they have yet to film a new episode of The ''[title of show]'' show. Hunter reminds Jeff that they have already agreed to produce thirteen episodes despite Jeff's criticisms.

Hunter and Jeff explain what the cast has been doing since the debut of Episode 8. The cast have been rehearsing, hosting the [[Drama Desk Awards]] and modeling in promotional photography sessions. Hunter jokes that the show has already won Tony Awards although it has not yet opened on Broadway. Jeff and Hunter then [[Teleportation|teleport]] to the Lyceum Theatre where the new marquee for the show is being hung over the street. Larry, Susan and Heidi are summoned to 45th street. When they try to enter the theater they realize they are locked out as the Broadway revival of [[Macbeth]] is still striking. The group returns to the apartment where they continue to plan for the upcoming Broadway production. They graciously thank their fans for their support over the past four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGTHhKxzPHQ|title=Episode 9 - "the [title of show] show"|first=|last=titleofshow|date=4 June 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Episode 10: Julyceum Song====

The show opens with [[Jeff Bowen]] and [[Hunter Bell]] outside Mindy's hospital room. A doctor comes out and tells them that she has just emerged from a 5-month coma. The show becomes a holiday special, featuring many of the guests  in Episode 10, including Cheyenne Jackson, who is here to "finish the job".

===Specials===

====The [title of show] Show Christmas Show====

Hunter, Susan, Heidi and Jeff reminisce and celebrate the Christmas spirit.  This episode introduced the puppets Grampa and Mindy played by Paul McGinnis and [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]] respectively. Further, [[Cheyenne Jackson]] makes his first of several appearances on the show. Rather than focusing on mounting ''[title of show]'' on Broadway, the show is a series of comedic skits and musical numbers. This includes the puppets getting drunk, references to old-fashioned Christmas specials and an original [[claymation]]. Hunter and Jeff thank the fans for their continuing support and wish their viewers a merry Christmas.

====Extra: Snake Eats Tail====

This episode begins with a series of telephone calls between Hunter and Jeff and explains what is termed the "snakeeatstailness" of ''[title of show]'', or how the show chronicles its own creation and encompasses a cyclical pattern explained as [[ouroboros]], a [[Greek language|Greek]] term for this pattern. The video links to additional videos on the ''[title of show]'' website and features guest actors.

====[tos]timonials====

The [title of show] show: Extra Testimonials are video reviews by viewers of ''[title of show]'''s Broadway production.

====9pft====

In this music video, set to the song "Nine People's Favorite Thing" (from ''[title of show]''), 600 fans were assigned one line each from the song through e-mail, and instructed to e-mail a picture of themselves illustrating the lyric.  The final video contains every picture, in lyrical order, as the song plays. The fans include everyday people and celebrities [[Patti LuPone]], [[Joel Grey]], [[Betty Buckley]], [[John Kander]], [[Jonathan Groff]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Jane Krakowski]], [[America Ferrera]], actor/siblings [[Celia Keenan-Bolger|Celia]], [[Maggie Keenan-Bolger|Maggie]], and [[Andrew Keenan-Bolger]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtdgvmYUuuA|title=9pft|first=|last=titleofshow|date=17 October 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 547''', adopted unanimously on 13 January 1984, after reaffirming previous [[United Nations Security Council resolution|resolutions]] on the topic, the Council expressed its concern at the [[Capital punishment|death sentences]] issued to Malesela Benjamin Maloise, all members of the [[African National Congress]].

The resolution called upon the South African authorities to commute the sentences imposed on Mr Maloise, and urged all other Member States and organisations to help save the life of the man. Maloise, a black poet, was convicted of murdering a policeman. Despite a court ruling that Maloise was under heavy psychological pressure at the time, President [[Pieter Willem Botha]] ordered his execution. On 18 October 1985, Maloise was hanged in [[Pretoria Central Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/20/weekinreview/the-world-the-toll-rises-in-south-africa.html|title=The toll rises in South Africa|last=Freudenheim|first=Milt|author2=Giniger, Henry |author3=Levine, Richard |date=20 October 1985|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uppsala Reggae Festival''' is the largest [[reggae]] [[festival]] in [[Scandinavia]]. It has been active since 2001, with a number of notable artists performing. It was first held in 2001, but the name was used as early as 1995. Uppsala Reggae Festival attracts attendees of all ages from all over the world. In connection with the 2001 festival, [[Uppsala]] was given the epithet "The Reggae [[Mecca]] of Scandinavia" by the Swedish National [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]], on the grounds that the festival then was the only festival in Scandinavia specifically dedicated to reggae. The third Uppsala Reggae Festival was awarded that year's cultural award by Swedish National Radio Broadcasting, and the fourth festival featured the largest reggae lineup ever to play in Scandinavia. Starting in 2002, the festival was held in August each year in [[Uppsala]], 70&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Stockholm]] until it relocated in 2012. In 2004, the festival settled down at its current venue, KAP, which is central and in the heart of the city. Both in 2004 and 2005, the festival had about 10,000 attendees. Moreover, in 2007, the festival had the most visitors recorded to date with approximately 24,000 patrons attending the festival.

In 2012, the festival moved to [[G√§vle]] where it was held in 2012 and 2013. However, after a couple of years, the promoters decided to cancel the festival. 
After a six year long hiatus, where the festival had left a big void in the city of [[Uppsala]], it was announced in December 2016 that the festival would be making a long-awaited comeback in 2017. It has been confirmed that the festival will be held at the same venue as prior years, with the biggest change being that it will only be one day, as opposed to the two or three days that had become the custom in the past.

'''[[Vanessa Williams]]''' (born March 18, 1963) is an American actress, singer, and fashion designer. She initially gained recognition as the first [[African American]] winner of the [[Miss America]] title when she was crowned [[Miss America 1984]] in September 1983. Several weeks before the end of her reign, however, a scandal arose when ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazine bought and published unauthorized&lt;ref name=vmpeoplelong/&gt; nude photographs of Williams. Williams was pressured to relinquish her title, and was succeeded by the first runner-up, [[Miss New Jersey]] 1983, [[Suzette Charles]].  Thirty-two years later, in September 2015,  when Williams served as head judge for the [[Miss America 2016]] pageant, former Miss America CEO Sam Haskell made a public apology to her for the events of 1984.

{{quote box|width=35%|align=right|quote=[I had] no idea that winning a Miss America title in 1983 would actually be so significant to people that had lived through the [[civil rights movement]]. And that to me was such an honor but also something that I had no idea the weight, and that there might be some bad consequences. To have white people who wanted to kill me because I was black and to have death threats against my family because they felt that I was tarnishing the Miss America crown because I was a black person.

When she was 20 years old, Williams was approached by scouts from the Miss Syracuse pageant who had seen her perform while a student at [[Syracuse University]]. Despite their encouragement,&lt;ref name=nprint/&gt;  Williams was not interested in participating in the pageant. She later changed her mind when she realized that she could earn scholarship money.&lt;ref name=nprint&gt;{{cite web

During her reign as Miss America, Williams was criticized in some venues for winning. She later stated that "there were a lot of people that did not want me to be representative of the United States and Miss America. And not just white people alone. There were a lot of people who had issues [...] I was too light. My eyes were the wrong color.

Williams would later comment that she was one of five minority contestants that year, noting that ballet dancer [[Deneen Graham]] "had already had a cross burned on her front yard because she was the first black [[Miss North Carolina]] [1983]."&lt;ref name=nprint/&gt; She also pointed out that "[[Suzette Charles]] was the first runner-up, and she was biracial. But when the press started, when I would go out on the - on the tour and do my appearances, and people would come up and say they never thought they'd see the day that it would happen; when people would want to shake my hand, and you'd see tears in their eyes, and they'd say, I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime - that's when, you know, it was definitely a very special honor."&lt;ref name=nprint/&gt;

===Resignation===
{{quote box|width=35%|align=right|quote=It began in the summer of 1982. I had finished my exams the first week of May at [[Syracuse University]] and came home to find a summer job. I saw an advertisement in a local newspaper reading "models wanted," so I called up and talked to Tom Chiapel, who was the photographer and part-owner of TEC studios. He said to come down for an interview ... When I returned later to pick up the proofs, Tom Chiapel indicated that he needed a makeup artist. He offered me an audition, so I came in and did a face. He decided to have me work for him as a makeup artist-receptionist ... I had worked there for a month and a half when Tom Chiapel mentioned several times that he'd like to shoot me in the nude. I had never posed nude and I was curious. I was 19 years old. I agreed. He assured me that none of the photographs would ever leave the studio. He assured me ... I trusted him not to do anything with the photographs. That was my error. I did not give my consent to him or ''Penthouse'' to ever have them published, used in any magazine or in any way. Nothing. I signed an application giving my height, weight, color of hair and my talents ... I never told anyone about the pictures, not even my parents. I did not think it was a concern. We had made an agreement they would never be published. I feel as if I were just a sacrificial lamb. The past just came up and kicked me. I felt betrayed and violated, like I had been raped.|source=‚ÄîVanessa Williams in 1984&lt;ref name=vmpeoplelong&gt;"[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20088398,00.html Vanessa's Story: The morning after Miss America 1984 talked with Assistant Editor Brenda Eady about the events leading to her abdication-and her hopes for the future]." ''[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]]'' Vol. 22, No.6, August 6, 1984: pp.85-87.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In July 1984 (two months before the end of her reign), Williams learned that nude photos of her, taken before her involvement with the pageant, would be published without her consent in a future issue of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''. Williams believed that the private photographs had been destroyed; she stated that she never signed a release permitting publication or use of the photos in a public format.&lt;ref name="Vanessa"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Hugh Hefner]] the publisher of ''[[Playboy]]'', was also given the opportunity to publish these photos but turned it down stating: "The single victim in all of this was the young woman herself, whose right to make this decision was taken away from her. If she wanted to make this kind of statement, that would be her business, but the statement wasn't made by her."&lt;ref name=heff&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timecost/&gt;

The black-and-white photos dated back to the summer of 1982 (after her freshman year at Syracuse University) when she worked as an assistant and makeup artist for [[Mount Kisco, New York]] photographer Tom Chiapel. At the time, Williams stated that Chiapel said that "he had a concept of having two models pose nude for silhouettes, basically to make different shapes and forms. The light would be behind the models. I was reluctant, but since he assured me that I would be the only one to see them and I would not be identifiable in the photographs, I agreed. He had also gotten another model to agree to this."&lt;ref name=vmpeoplelong/&gt; In a 2012 interview with [[National Public Radio (United States)|NPR]], Williams discussed these events stating that her mother:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kept saying, 'you're just like your father; you're too trusting' And there's a part of me that, I do give people the benefit of the doubt ...  it's also being free ...  that was the mode I was in at that particular time, when I took those racy pictures, because I was already in college so you can't tell me what to do. So - I wasn't actually in high school - so my mentality was what - I'm living my own life; I'm a spirited, young woman; I can handle this; I can handle anything. And at 19, you think you rule the world, and you can control things. And a lot of times, you don't.&lt;ref name=nprint/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After learning that ''Penthouse'' would be publishing these photos, the Miss America Organization responded by giving Williams 72 hours to resign.&lt;ref name="rrint" /&gt; Williams later stated that "the heightened spectacle and circus of it all was kind of crazy. I had people saying 'Fight for the crown! Fight for the crown!' and people chanting 'Don't give it up! Don't secede!' "&lt;ref name="rrint" /&gt; Williams also later noted that the situation was particularly hard on her mother Helen, who felt that she should not resign as Williams had performed her "duties and excelled at everything I was asked to do plus doing 50% more of appearances that were not scheduled because I was the first African American Miss America."&lt;ref name="rrint" /&gt; Helen was also upset that "the pageant did not come to my support, they felt I needed to resign."&lt;ref name="rrint" /&gt;

Williams, however, decided to resign, and formally announced her decision at a press conference held on July 23, 1984. The title subsequently went to the first runner-up, Miss New Jersey [[Suzette Charles]] who served out the final seven weeks of Williams' reign.&lt;ref name="timecost"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 7, 1984, Williams filed a $500 million lawsuit against Chiapel and ''Penthouse'' publisher [[Bob Guccione]]; she dropped the lawsuit a year later stating that she wanted to put the scandal behind her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Miss America Vanessa Williams Overcomes Her Disgrace by Showing and Singing the Right Stuff|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20119453,00.html|date=January 30, 1989|first=John|last=Stark|first2=Michael|last2=Alexander|work=People|accessdate=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/08/nyregion/the-region-ex-miss-america-sues-over-photos.html | work=The New York Times | title=THE REGION; Ex-Miss America Sues Over Photos | date=September 8, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, ''Penthouse'' published the unauthorized photos in its September 1984 issue, which the  [[PBS]] documentary ''Miss America'' described as "the most successful issue ''Penthouse'' magazine ever printed, netting Guccione a windfall profit of $14 million."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

==1984‚Äì2015==
After her resignation, Williams rebounded as a recording artist and actress. However, she also faced a long period of what she would later describe as "[[Public humiliation|the betrayal, and the humiliation]], that happened to me on a grand scale."&lt;ref name="nprint" /&gt;''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' magazine concurred stating that Williams was the subject of "[[Slut-shaming|public shaming and bullying]] from the public at large"&lt;ref name="essenceres"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essence.com/2015/09/10/vanessa-williams-judge-miss-america-pageant-32-years-after-scandal|title=Vanessa Williams Returns to Judge Miss America Pageant, 32 Years After Scandal|last=Lewis|first=Taylor|date=2015-09-10|publisher=''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]''|accessdate=2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' noted that her "career and reputation tanked.

She would also later state that these events delayed her career by about ten years,&lt;ref name="capecode"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "it seemed like an eternity in which I was the punch line to every late-night monologue ... [[Joan Rivers]], whom I adored and met on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson#Joan Rivers|The Tonight Show]]'' during my reign, was particularly relentless. Just when I figured she'd exhausted every possible Vanessa Williams joke, she'd have a whole new slew of them."&lt;ref name="longpast" /&gt; Williams would also later tell of one audition that she had during the late 1980s for a theatrical role. She was denied the role, however, because "the wife of lyricist [[Ira Gershwin]] decreed: 'Over my dead body will that whore be in my show.' "&lt;ref name="capecode" /&gt; In addition, her parents experienced "an incredible amount of shame and humiliation" and were equally the subject of harassment at the time.&lt;ref name="rrint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="longpast" /&gt;

Thirty years after the scandal broke, Amanda Marcotte suggested in ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;we owe a lot to Vanessa Williams for being a pioneer when it comes to showing the world how to recover when you've been unjustly shamed for being sexual. Williams could have slunk off into the shadows in shame, which no doubt many people at the time expected her to do. Williams picked herself up and kept fighting for a career as an entertainer, first by becoming a successful singer and then becoming a well-known comic actress ... Sleazy people tried to drag Vanessa Williams down with accusations of being sexual 30 years ago, but she moved on, showing she had nothing to be ashamed of.&lt;ref name="dbcom"&gt;{{cite web

In addition, Williams commented on her ability to persevere after these events in a 2015 interview with ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' by stating that "you can't give up ... you always have to remember what you're made of and not let circumstances get in the way. They might delay your progress for the moment, but you always have to remember who you are, and that will give you the [[Eyes on the Prize|eyes on the prize]]."&lt;ref name=et15&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been a close friend of this beautiful and talented lady for 32 years. You have lived your life in grace and dignity, and never was it more evident than during the events of 1984, when you resigned.

A few months after the pageant, Williams discussed the apology in an interview with [[Gayle King]], [[Charlie Rose]], and [[Norah O'Donnell]] for ''[[CBS This Morning]]''. King asked her about the circumstances that led to it stating, "I think many people were touched when the Miss America pageant issued an apology to you."&lt;ref name=cbsmorning&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams credited Haskell (who was one of her judges during the Miss America 1984 pageant) for orchestrating her return. While both she and her mother initially responded with hesitation to the invitation, Williams finally agreed to participate on the condition that she could sing her song "Oh How the Years Go By" (to symbolize the passing of time since she was Miss America). She didn't know what Haskel would say, stating that she was simply told to stand and wait for him during the commercial break that would take place after her song. It was only when he arrived and placed his hand on her back (where she noticed that his hand was shaking) that Williams realized something significant was about to happen. Williams said that one of the most important outcomes of the apology was the positive impact that it had on her mother, who "endured a lot" during that period.&lt;ref name="cbsmorning" /&gt;

After the pageant, Williams' replacement [[Suzette Charles]] stated in an interview with ''[[Inside Edition]]'' that she was perplexed over the apology and suggested that it was given for the purpose of ratings.&lt;ref name=charlesresp&gt;{{cite web

Williams responded: "That's crazy. To think that oh you can look at a scandal and think that that would be good for your career, where for me it took every ounce of credibility and talent that I had and wiped it out."&lt;ref name=rrint/&gt;

==Accidents and fatalities==
An accident during a stunt flight resulted in the death of [[Jim LeRoy]], who was pronounced dead on July 28, 2007 in a military [[Medical evacuation|MEDEVAC]] helicopter while in transit to [[Miami Valley Hospital]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.whiotv.com/news/13774845/detail.html |title=Dayton Air Show Crash Kills Pilot - News Story - WHIO Dayton |access-date=2008-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201231032/http://www.whiotv.com/news/13774845/detail.html |archive-date=2008-12-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airliners.net/discussions/general_aviation/read.main/3533213/ Jim LeRoy Dies In Airshow Crash ‚Äî Civil Aviation Forum | Airliners.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=investigation&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.whiotv.com/news/13780478/detail.html |title=Coroner: Pilot Died Instantly - News Story - WHIO Dayton |access-date=2008-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222180158/http://www.whiotv.com/news/13780478/detail.html |archive-date=2008-02-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason of this crash was reported as pilot error by the [[NTSB]].&lt;ref Name="Nolan"&gt;{{cite web

On June 22, 2013, a plane carrying wing walker Jane Wicker crashed at the air show, killing both Wicker and pilot Charlie Schwenker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plane with wing walker crashes at Ohio air show, kills 2|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/06/22/plane-with-wing-walker-crashes-at-ohio-air-show/2448941/|publisher=USA Today|access-date=22 June 2013|first1=Alan|last1=Gomez|date=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2017, the day before the air show, a Thunderbirds [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16D]] jet, not scheduled to perform, was taxiing to a staging area after a familiarization flight, when witnesses reported a gust of wind flipped the aircraft onto its top in a grassy area next to the taxiway. Both the pilot and a team crew member were trapped in the airplane for two hours; the pilot suffered only minor injuries while the crew member had no visible injuries. The Thunderbirds canceled their scheduled performances for both days of the air show.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.dayton.com/news/national/thunderbird-plane-flips-its-top-ohio-air-show/7UcEitelzbTiO2Rv48vE1I/ | title = Thunderbird F-16 plane flips on its top at Ohio air show | newspaper = [[Dayton Daily News]] | author = Staff | date = June 23, 2017 | access-date = June 24, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local/thunderbirds-jet-ohio-accident-good-condition/bAdEgFcbwLtNrTPgDWyPOM/ | title = 2 on Thunderbirds jet in Ohio accident in good condition | newspaper = [[Dayton Daily News]] | author = [[Associated Press]] | date = June 23, 2017 | access-date = June 24, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/thunderbirds-will-not-perform-sunday-vectren-dayton-air-show/9hYLy25uRDPep71YW9P2HJ/ | title = Thunderbirds will not perform Sunday at Vectren Dayton Air Show | newspaper = [[Dayton Daily News]] | author1 = Breaking news staff | last2 = Barber | first2 = Barrie | last3 = Driscoll | first3 = Kara | date = June 24, 2017 | access-date = June 24, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of weather on attendance==
Unusually high temperatures led to greatly decreased attendance for the 2012 show. As such, it was announced in October, 2012 that the 2013 show would be moved from July to June.&lt;ref name="tojune"&gt;{{cite news | title=Dayton Air Show moved to June | last=Barber | first=Barrie | publisher=[[Dayton Daily News]] | date = October 11, 2012 | url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/business/dayton-air-show-moving-to-june/nSYzx/ | access-date=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trend has continued through 2016; the 2016 show was held from June 18-19 2016. The previous year's air show had lost attendance as well due to weather, however, the loss was due to heavy rains, which also forced the temporary grounding of some acts.&lt;ref name="shows20152016"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/local/blue-angels-and-wwii-act-headline-2016-air-show/nnb6Z/|title=Blue Angels and WWII act headline 2016 air show|first=Barrie|last=Barber|date=September 10, 2015|access-date=June 3, 2016|publisher=Dayton Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 51,000 spectators attended the 2016 show, a large increase from the 40,000 of the previous year. This was despite the absence of a scheduled headliner act, the [[Blue Angels]], following the group's temporary grounding due to the death of one of its pilots in a crash on June 2.&lt;ref name="2016attendance"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.whio.com/news/news/local/dayton-air-show-brings-in-estimated-51k-people/nrjhP/|title=Dayton Air Show brings in estimated 51K people|first=Barrie|last=Barber|date=June 20, 2016|access-date=June 20, 2016|publisher=WHIO-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
