'''''65_RedRoses''''' is a 2009 [[documentary film]] about [[Eva Markvoort]], a young woman from [[New Westminster]], British Columbia, who suffered from [[cystic fibrosis]]. Directed by Philip Lyall and Nimisha Mukerji, it follows Markvoort as she lives her life undaunted by her disease, waiting for a [[Lung transplantation|lung transplant]] while [[blogging]] about her experiences.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/04/27/blog.terminal.illness/index.html?hpt=C1|title=Death at 25: Blogging the end of a life|last=Park|first=Madison|date=April 27, 2010|work=CNN Health|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. |accessdate=27 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100429143506/http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/04/27/blog.terminal.illness/index.html?hpt=C1| archivedate= 29 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The film began when [[Philip Lyall]], a long-time friend of Markvoort, introduced her to his [[University of British Columbia]] film school partner [[Nimisha Mukerji]]. Lyall and Mukerji had been looking for a post-graduation project and decided to chronicle Markvoort's wait for a double-lung transplant. They named the film ''65_Redroses'' after Eva's [[online identity]], which she had chosen because, according to the Canadian cystic fibrosis community, "sixty-five roses" is how many young children with the disease mispronounce "cystic fibrosis".&lt;ref name="65 Roses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cff.org/aboutCFFoundation/About65Roses/|title=About 65 Roses|publisher=[[Cystic Fibrosis Foundation]]|accessdate=30 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100430053456/http://www.cff.org/AboutCFFoundation/About65Roses/| archivedate= 30 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eva added 'red' because it was her favourite colour.&lt;ref name="eye"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/film/tv/article/77157 |title=Wave of inspiration |last=Cauchi |first=E.D. |date=November 16, 2009 |work=[[Eye Weekly]] |accessdate=4 April 2010 |location=Toronto }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lyall and Mukerji began shooting, Markvoort's lungs were so clogged doctors said that without a transplant, she would not live to 2009.  She was getting ready to visit a [[pumpkin]] patch the week before [[Halloween]] in 2007, when her [[pager]]  went off, a signal to call the hospital transplant center.  A pair of lungs was available for transplant. This sequence, emotional for both Markvoort and the filmmakers, was instrumental in attracting the attention and backing of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref name="eye"/&gt;

==Release==
''65_Redroses'' premiered at the [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]] and won three awards at the [[Vancouver International Film Festival]], including most popular Canadian film and documentary. It debuted on television on CBC's ''[[The Passionate Eye]]'' series and was acquired by the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] for international distribution.&lt;ref name="eye"/&gt;

On November 16, 2010, it was announced that ''65_Redroses'' had been acquired by the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]] and would premiere in the United States in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121130204/http://www.indiewire.com/article/2010/11/15/own_picks_up_three_docs_for_spring_debut/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern usage, an '''aquamanile''' (plural '''aquamanilia''' or simply '''aquamaniles''') is a [[ewer]] or [[Jug (container)|jug]]-type vessel in the form of one or more animal or human figures.  It usually contained water for the washing of hands (''aqua'' + ''manos'') over a basin, which was part of both upper-class meals and the Christian [[Eucharist]].  Historically the term was sometimes used for any shape of basin or ewer so used, regardless of shape.  Most surviving examples are in metal, typically [[copper alloy]]s ([[brass]] or [[bronze]]), as pottery versions have rarely survived.

==Islamic art==
Persian aquamaniles predate any zoomorphic aquamaniles known in Europe. An Iranian (Abbasid caliphate), Aquamanile in the form of an eagle, bearing the date 180 AH/CE 796-797, of bronze, inlaid with silver and copper, in the [[State Hermitage Museum]], St. Petersburg, is the earliest dated Islamic object in metalwork.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky M.B. and Rogers, J.M. (eds), ''Heaven on Earth: Art from Islamic Lands'', pp. 80-81, 2004, Prestel, {{ISBN|3791330551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the latest in date is one also at the State Hermitage Museum, a late Islamic aquamanile from [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], dated 1206.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrovsky M.B. and Rogers, J.M. (eds), ''Heaven on Earth: Art from Islamic Lands'', p. 89, 2004, Prestel, {{ISBN|3791330551}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aniconism in Islam|Islamic law deprecated]] the use of such representational figures, and the Islamic zoomorphic aquamanile tradition died out.

However the tradition was taken up enthusiastically in Europe, where the form remained popular until the Renaissance.

==Europe==
[[File:Aquamanile in the Form of a Lion MET DP117252.jpg|thumb|left|''Aquamanile in the Form of a Lion'', [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aquamanile_in_the_Form_of_a_Lion_MET_DP117252.jpg Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]
[[File:Equestrian Knight Aquamanile.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze aquamanile in the form of a mounted knight, second half of the 13th century, [[Lower Saxony]] ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])]]
The [[Byzantine Empire]]'s cultural connections with [[Sassanid|Sassanid Persia]] and the [[Abbasid]] caliphate, never peaceful in the political sphere, nevertheless brought the aquamanile into the Christian Mediterranean world. The earliest European portable aquamaniles date to the eleventh century.
Ewers and basins were needed in  [[Christian liturgy]] for the ritual of the [[lavabo]], in which the officiating priest washes his hands before vesting, again before the consecration of the Eucharist and after mass.  As a ritual object, metal was considered more suitable than pottery, although most examples in pottery no doubt were broken and discarded. The aquamaniles made in the [[Mosan art|Mosan]] – or [[Meuse]] valley – region, using the [[brass]] alloy of silvery tint called ''dinanderie'' (from the center of its manufacture in the region of [[Dinant]]) were often fantastic and zoomorphic in their forms, which were constrained only by the need for a larger opening for filling the vessel and a spout for pouring. Church records inventory aquamaniles in silver or gilt copper, but the great majority of surviving examples are in base metals, which were not worth melting down.


[[File:Aguamanil medieval paloma (M.A.N. Inv.2005-72-1) 01.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An 11–12th century [[Islamic art|Islamic]] aquamanile from [[Iran]], later used in liturgy by [[Spain in the Middle Ages|Medieval Spanish]] Christians ([[National Archaeological Museum of Spain|M.A.N.]], [[Madrid]])]]
[[File:Aquamanile Aachener Domschatz.jpg|thumb|Aquamanile, about 1170/80, ([[Aachen Cathedral Treasury]])]]

As well as the altar, aquamaniles were used at the tables of the great, where extravagant designs of symbolic or fantastical beasts – lions were especially popular – were developed in purely secular [[iconography]]. A gold aquamanile, c. 1215, in the treasury of the [[Aachen Cathedral|cathedral]] at [[Aachen]], takes the form of a man's bust; it is a rare survival of an aquamanile in a precious metal. An aquamanile (ref. Metropolitan Museum) in the form of [[Aristotle]] on hands and knees, being ridden by Phyllis, bore several moral lessons, with ribald undertones; such an aquamanile was distinctly secular in nature.

Bronze aquamaniles in the form of leopards were part of court ritual in [[Benin]], where the concept may have arrived from the Islamic north. An 18th-century bronze leopard aquamanile from Benin is in the collection of the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]].

From the Renaissance elaborate versions of the conventional ewer were preferred to zoomorphic forms.  A late version of the aquamanile was the silver-gilt mounted rider on a stand, bought in 1700 for the treasury of the [[Basilica of St-Denis]] and sold in 1798. Its form is recorded in an engraving by Félibien. (ref. St-Denis) The idea of [[ewer]]s in fantastic shapes has never died out.

==Production==
[[T. S. B. K. Moulee]] in an interview in 2014 told that Balachander, who used to watch Moulee's plays, wanted him to write a comedy track for the film as he liked Moulee's style of writing. Moulee, however, felt that the film did not warrant any separate comedy as it would "dilute its seriousness" and did not work on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/mouli-and-the-moolah/article6107714.ece?secpage=true&amp;secname=entertainment|title=Mouli and the moolah|author=T.

'''Arthur Garner''' (born 8 February 1851) was a theatrical entrepreneur, active in Australia.&lt;ref name=Mennell&gt;{{cite Australasia|Garner, Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Princess Theatre, Melbourne, Australia.jpg|thumb|The Princess's Theatre, Melbourne. Built in 1886 by Garner, Williamson &amp; Musgrove]]
Garner was born in [[Bath, Somerset]], England, where his father, Dr. Jonathan Garner (M.D. of Edinburgh) practised his profession, his mother being a Miss Cobden. Arthur Garner was articled to [[Charles J. Phipps]], the architect, whose connection was largely theatrical, he having erected no less than forty English theatres; from which circumstance may perhaps be traced the young pupil's gravitation to the stage, where he became a ''protégé'' of Mr. George Gordon, the scenic artist. From the paint-room Garner soon found his way to the footlights, and for some time appeared in various provincial companies.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt;

==Early years==
In 1873 Garner arrived in [[Melbourne]], returning to London in 1876. In 1879 Garner began his career as an Australian entrepreneur by taking out "The London Comedy Company" (1879), of which Fred Marshall was the bright particular comic star and Mr. George Gordon the hardly less indispensable scenic artist.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt; Garner opened Garner's Theatre (previously [[White's Rooms]]) in [[Adelaide]] in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/contributor/?id=407326 |title=Arthur Garner |publisher=AusStage |accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1881 Garner joined [[J. C. Williamson]], the eminent Australian-American actor, and [[George Musgrove]] in establishing the leading firm of Australasian managers, generally known as the "Trio," which has controlled a greater number of theatres and entered into engagements, dramatic and operatic, on a larger scale than has ever been attempted in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt; Their operations practically commenced at the [[Theatre Royal, Melbourne]], on July 1, 1882, with the production of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[Patience (opera)|''Patience'']]. Many eminent London ''artistes'' were introduced to the colonies under their regime; but the most substantial undertaking of Williamson, Garner &amp; Musgrove was the building of the new [[Princess Theatre, Melbourne|Princess's Theatre, Melbourne]], in 1886, regarded as one of the finest theatres in the world.

==Married Life==
Garner was twice married: first, to the noted English actress Blanche Stammers, who died in Melbourne in 1883; and, secondly, to Letitia Hill Martin, sister of [[Patchett Martin]], herself an accomplished ''littérateur'', and formerly a contributor to the Australian press.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt;

They retired to England, living at 36 Kempshott-road, [[Streatham Common]], Surrey. He died sometime before 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120696931 |title=Frederick de Belleville |newspaper=[[Sunday Times]] |issue=1335 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=20 August 1911 |accessdate=3 April 2016 |page=20 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1588">'''Artsadmin''' is a UK-based organisation founded in 1979 by Judith Knight and Seonaid Stewart, providing project management to a number of contemporary artists (see below), as well as support and resources for artists at any stage of their career working particularly in the fields of new theatre, [[dance]], music, [[live art]] and mixed media work. The organisation has established a range of new opportunities for emerging and unfunded artists with a bursary and mentoring scheme, a full-time advisory service, education programme and a programme of showcases.  

Based at Toynbee Studios in East London (part of [[Toynbee Hall]]), Artsadmin offers rehearsal studios available for hire and workspaces for artists.  The building was refurbished in 2006 and includes six spaces of varying sizes for hire suitable for rehearsals, castings and showcases (including a rooftop studio) and eight additional creative media units, and the popular Arts Bar &amp; Café.

'''Artsadmin''' works closely with promoters, producers and other arts organisations in the UK and internationally to develop audiences for the work of its artists, and with other partner organisations on the development of support schemes and resources for artists.

'''Center for Culinary Arts, Manila (CCA)''' is an institution which provides culinary education in the [[Philippines]]. CCA, Manila was formally established in 1996 and is currently located in Katipunan Avenue, [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]]. CCA, Manila has satellite campuses in Farmers Market, Cubao; a Restaurant School at SM Mall of Asia called Oceana and at Eastwood Mall called CCA Kitchen . CCA offers diploma and certificate programs accredited by the accrediting commission of the American Culinary Federation. The school also offers basic courses for beginners and professionals as well as international degree succession and certification.

==History==
CCA, Manila finds its roots with the opening of the Cravings Bakeshop on October 16, 1988. This gave birth to the Cravings Group of Companies.

Thus, the conceptualization of CCA, Manila began and took form. This was materialized by the team of experts led by Dr. John Knapp, project coordinator of the [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology]] in Canada, and the University of the Philippines-College of [[Family and consumer science|Home Economics]]. It took three years to assess the needs of the industry, formulate an effective curriculum, form a team of chef instructors, and construct the [[Cooking school|culinary school]] itself. CCA was established on August 26, 1996, followed by the launch of the country’s first formal culinary education program, the Diploma in Culinary Arts and Technology Management (DCAM) in 1997.

==Education==
===Academic Programs===
The CCA offers both diploma and certificate programs in either [[Culinary art|Culinary Arts]] or Baking and Pastry Arts. Apart from lectures and spending at least 5 hours daily in the kitchen laboratories, students undergo actual hotel work for their apprenticeship to acquire mastery of techniques.

The school also offers an International Degree Succession program which is available through their partner schools should one decided to enhance their one- or two-year program and earn a degree.  These schools are William Angliss Institute in Australia, Johnson and Wales University in the US, Les Roches in Switzerland, Thames Valley University in the UK, and the Northern Alberta Institute in Canada.

Graduates of two-year program in Culinary Arts &amp; Technology Management and one-year program in Baking and Pastry Arts who are active members of American Culinary Federation Foundation are eligible for ACF certification.

===Continuing Education Programs===
The CCA offers continuing education courses for basic, intermediate and advanced professionals. It also features a creative recreational course for profit. A kitchen discovery class for hobbyists and enthusiasts is also offered.

[[File:Réaccrochage de la salle IItalie-Espagne après la guerre 1914-1918.jpg|thumb|right|In the center of the picture, Emile Theodore (museum curator of the [[w:Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille|Palace of Fine Arts in Lille (museum)]] from 1912 to 1937, here during reconstruction of the gallery dedicated to Spanish and Italian paintings, two years after the end of the First World War]]

A '''curator''' (from {{lang-la|cura}}, meaning "to take care")&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Curator |volume=7 |page=636}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a manager or overseer. Traditionally, a curator or '''keeper''' of a [[cultural heritage]] institution (e.g., [[Art museum|gallery]], [[museum]], [[library]], or [[archive]]) is a content specialist charged with an institution's [[Collection (artwork)|collections]] and involved with the [[Heritage interpretation|interpretation]] of heritage material.

A traditional curator's concern necessarily involves tangible objects of some sort — artwork, collectibles, historic items, or scientific collections. More recently, new kinds of curators have started to emerge: [[digital curation|curators of digital data objects]] and [[biocurator]]s.

== Curation scope ==
In smaller organizations, a curator may have sole responsibility for acquisitions and even for [[collections care]]. The curator makes decisions regarding what objects to select, oversees their potential and documentation, conducts research based on the collection and its history, provides proper [[packaging and labeling|packaging]] of art for transportation, and shares  research with the public and community through exhibitions and publications. In very small, volunteer-based museums such as those of local historical societies, a curator may be the only paid staff-member.

In larger institutions, the curator's primary function is that of a subject specialist, with the expectation that he or she will conduct original research on objects and guide the organization in its collecting. Such institutions can have multiple curators, each assigned to a specific collecting area (e.g., curator of ancient art, curator of prints and drawings, etc.) and often operating under the direction of a head curator. In such organizations, the physical care of the collection may be overseen by museum collections-managers or by museum conservators, with documentation and administrative matters (such as personnel, insurance, and loans) handled by a museum registrar.

In the United Kingdom, the term "curator" also applies to government employees who monitor the quality of contract archaeological work under [[PPG 16|Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and Planning (PPG 16)]] and manage the cultural resource of a region. In the museum setting, a curator in the United Kingdom may also be called a "keeper".

In Scotland, the term "curator" is also used to mean the guardian of a child, known as [[Curator ad litem|curator ''ad litem'']].{{citation needed|date= February 2014}}

In the US, curators have multifaceted tasks dependent on the particular institution and its mission. But in recent years{{when?|date=March 2018}} the role of the curator has evolved alongside the changing role of museums. As US museums have become increasingly more digitized, curators find themselves constructing narratives in both the material and digital worlds. Historian Elaine Gurian has called for museums in which "visitors could comfortably search for answers to their own questions regardless of the importance placed on such questions by others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clough |first=Wayne |title=Best of Both Worlds: Museums, Libraries and Achieves in the Digital Age |date=2013 |publisher= [[The Smithsonian Institution]] |page=30 |url=http://www.si.edu/content/gwc/BestofBothWorldsSmithsonian.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would change the role of curator from teacher to "facilitator and assistor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clough |first=Wayne |title=Best of Both Worlds: Museums Libraries and Archives in a Digital World |date=2013 |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution |page=30 |url=http://www.si.edu/content/gwc/BestofBothWorldsSmithsonian.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this sense, the role of curator in the United States is precarious, as digital and interactive exhibits often allow members of the public to become their own curators, and to choose their own information. Citizens are then able to educate themselves on the specific subject they are interested in, rather than spending time listening to information they have no desire to learn.

More recently,{{when?|date=March 2018}} advances{{which?|date=March 2018}} in new technologies have led to a further widening of the role of curator. This has been a focus in major art institutions internationally and has become an object of academic study and research.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In [[contemporary art]], the title "curator" identifies a person who selects and often interprets works of art. In addition to selecting works, the curator is often responsible for writing labels, catalog essays, and other content supporting exhibitions. Such curators may be permanent staff members, "guest curators" from an affiliated organization or university, or "freelance curators" working on a consultancy basis. The late-20th century saw an explosion of artists organizing exhibitions. The artist-curator has a long tradition of influence, notably featuring Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] (1723-1792), inaugural president of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], London, founded in 1768.

In some US cultural organizations, the term "curator" may designate the head of any given division. This has led to the proliferation of titles such as "Curator of Education" and "Curator of Exhibitions". The term "literary curator" has been used to describe persons who work in the field of poetry, such as former [[92nd Street Y]] poetry-director [[Karl Kirchwey]].&lt;ref name=twsOctB75544&gt;{{cite news

}}{{dead link|date= December 2016 |bot= InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted= yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend has increasingly been mirrored in the United Kingdom in such institutions as Ikon, Birmingham, UK and Baltic, Gateshead, UK.

In Australia and New Zealand the term also applies to a person who prepares a sports ground for use (especially a [[Cricket field| cricket ground]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blogs.espncricinfo.com/thebuzz/archives/2010/12/adelaide_curator_annoys_kp.php|title= The Cordon – Cricket Blogs – ESPN Cricinfo|work= Cricinfo|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101204114323/http://blogs.espncricinfo.com/thebuzz/archives/2010/12/adelaide_curator_annoys_kp.php|archivedate= December 4, 2010|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This job is equivalent to that of [[Groundskeeping|groundsman]] in some other cricketing nations.

In France, the term curator is translated as ''conservateur''. There are two kinds of curators: heritage curators (''conservateurs du patrimoine'') with five specialities (archeology, archives, museums, historical monuments, natural science museums), and librarian curators (''conservateurs des bibliothèques''). These curators are selected by competitive examination and attend the INP (Institut National du Patrimoine)&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Institut national du patrimoine (France)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason= per WP:CIRCULAR|date= November 2017}}. The "conservateurs du patrimoine" are civil servants or work in the public service; the use of the title by private workers is not possible.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Curators hold a high academic degree in their subject, typically a Doctor of Philosophy or a master's degree in subjects such as history, [[history of art]], art, [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], or [[classics]].&lt;ref name="times-how-do-i"&gt;Carly Chynoweth, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/student/how_to_get_a_job/article989842.ece ''How do I become a museum curator?''] December 22, 2006, Times Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="day-in-the-life"&gt;Valarie Kinkade, [http://www.aam-us.org/pubs/webexclusive/kinkade.cfm ''Day in the life: curator.''] American Alliance of Museums&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edubook-how-to"&gt;Stephanie A. Harper, [http://www.edubook.com/how-to-become-a-museum-curator/8589/ ''How to become a museum curator.''] July 6, 2009, Edubook&lt;/ref&gt; Curators are also expected to have contributed to their academic field, for example, by delivering public talks, publishing articles, or presenting at specialist academic conferences.&lt;ref name="times-how-do-i" /&gt; It is important that curators have knowledge of the current collecting market for their area of expertise, and are aware of current ethical practices and laws that may impact their organisation's collecting.&lt;ref name="curcom-ethics"&gt;[http://www.aam-us.org/docs/continuum/curcomethics.pdf ''A code of ethics for curators.''] 2009, American Alliance of Museums Curators Committee&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="combatting-illicit-trade"&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Combating_Illicit_Trade05.pdf ''Combatting Illicit Trade: Due diligence guidelines for museums, libraries and archives on collecting and borrowing cultural material.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927233414/http://culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Combating_Illicit_Trade05.pdf |date=September 27, 2010 }} October 2005, Department for Culture, Media and Sport&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased complexity of many museums and cultural organisations has prompted the emergence of professional programs in fields such as public history, [[public humanities]], [[Museology|museum studies]], [[Arts administration|arts management]], and curating/curatorial practice.&lt;ref name="hang-it-all"&gt;Niru Ratnam, [https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/mar/09/features.magazine47 ''Hang it all.''] March 9, 2003, The Observer&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[Royal College of Art]] established an MA course co-funded by the Royal College of Art and the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], the first in Britain to specialise in curating with a particular focus on [[contemporary art]]. The course is now funded by [[Arts Council England]], and in 2001 the course title was amended to Curating Contemporary Art to more accurately reflect the content and primary focus of the programme.&lt;ref name="cca-intro"&gt;[http://www.cca.rca.ac.uk/docs/introduction/index.htm ''Curating contemporary art.'']{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Royal College of Art&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a number of contemporary art institutions launched curatorial study courses as an alternative to traditional academic programs. Established in 1987, the École du Magasin is a curatorial training program based at the art center [[Le Magasin]] in Grenoble, France. Similarly, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], through its independent study program, hosts a curatorial program as one of its three study areas, and [[de Appel]] arts centre has hosted a curatorial programme since 1994. Other institutions that run programs in curating include [[Norwich University of the Arts]]; The Courtauld Institute of Art, London, UK, [[Kingston University]]; [[Goldsmiths, University of London]]; [[Birkbeck, University of London]]; [[Chelsea College of Arts]]; [[University of the Arts London]]; [[California College of the Arts]]; [[University of Southern California]]; [[Bard College]]; [[School of Visual Arts]]; the [[École du Louvre]]; the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage), [[University of Rennes 2 – Upper Brittany|University of Rennes 2—Upper Brittany]]; [[OCAD University]]; and [[University of Melbourne]]. (See ''[[#External links|→External links]]'' for further information on courses.)

== Community curation ==
Community curation - alternately known as public curation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Kris | last1=Morrissey | first2=Tom | last2=Satwicz |title=“Public Curation: From Trend to Research-Based Practice” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World|year=2011|publisher=The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-9834803-0-3|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; - is a movement in US museums and [[public humanities]] organizations to involve community members in various curatorial processes, including exhibit development and programming. Community members involved in community curation are likely not trained as museum professionals, but have vested interests in the outcomes of curatorial projects. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLean|first=Kathleen|title=“Whose Questions, Whose Conversations?” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World|year=2011|publisher=The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-9834803-0-3|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community curation is a response to the 19th century “information transmission” model of learning, in which museums are sources of expert knowledge and visitors are the recipients of that expertise. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLean|first=Kathleen|title=“Whose Questions, Whose Conversations?” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World|year=2011|publisher=The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-9834803-0-3|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community curation seeks not to abandon expertise, but to broaden definitions of expertise to “include broader domains of experience” that visitors bring to museums. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLean|first=Kathleen|title=“Whose Questions, Whose Conversations?” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go?

Community curation practices are varied. The [[Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience|Wing Luke Museum]] conducts community outreach at the beginning of exhibition projects, and convenes community advisory committees at various stages in the curatorial process. &lt;ref name=broom&gt;{{cite news | last = Chinn | first = Cassie | title = Push Me, Pull You | newspaper=[[Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage]] |date = June 22, 2012 | url=https://www.pewcenterarts.org/post/push-me-pull-you-cassie-chinn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brooklyn Historical Society]] has accepted exhibit proposals from community members and trained them in curatorial skills to co-create exhibits. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Deborah|title=“Community as Curator: A Case Study at the Brooklyn Historical Society” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go? Sharing Historical Authority in a User-Generated World|year=2011|publisher=The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-9834803-0-3|pages=113-114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such efforts to allow communities to participate in curation can require "''more'' not less expertise from museum staff." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Filene|first=Benjamin|title=“Listening Intently: Can StoryCorps Teach Museums How to Win the Hearts of New Audiences?” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go?

== Technology and society ==
In the same way that a museum curator may acquire objects of relevance or an art curator may select or interpret a work of art, the injection of technology and impact of [[social media]] into every aspect of society has seen the emergence of technology curators.

Technology curators are people who are able to disentangle the science and logic of a particular technology and apply it to real world situations and society, whether it is for social change, commercial advantage, or other purposes. The first UK ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' Conference had a test lab, where an independent curator selected technology that showcased radical technology advancements and their impact on society, such as the ability to design and [[3D printing|"print"]] physical objects using [[3D printer]]s (such as a fully working violin) or the ability to model and represent accurate interactive medical and molecular models in stereoscopic 3D.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiredevent.co.uk/wired/agenda&lt;/ref&gt; 

MLOVE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlove.com|title=MLOVE|work=mlove.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MLOVE Confestival Disrupts the Perception of What a Tech Conference Should Be: Inspiring, Innovative and Thought Provoking|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/07/prweb4230094.htm|newspaper=PRWeb|date=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Confestival started in 2010, celebrated the disruption of the perception of what a tech conference should be, using a radically more interactive format that drew on a variety of influences outside of the traditional world of technology, including religion, micro-banking for developing countries, and interactive art installations/workshops such as the Future Cube&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside a Future Cube at MLOVE|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy9NYRayoTs|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a giant interactive video projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Projektil MLOVE Lighting Show|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RLdrkRHF14|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7368">'''Dance is present in mythology and religion''' globally. Dance has certainly been an important part of [[ceremony]], [[ritual]]s, [[celebration (party)|celebration]]s and [[entertainment]] since before the birth of the earliest human [[civilization]]s. [[Archeology]] delivers traces of dance from [[prehistory|prehistoric times]] such as the 5,000-year-old [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] paintings in [[India]] and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb paintings depicting dancing figures from c. 3300 BC.

One of the earliest structured uses of dances may have been in the performance and in the telling of myths. It was also sometimes used to show feelings for one of the opposite gender. It is also linked to the origin of "love making." Before the production of written languages, dance was one of the methods of passing these stories down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="lecomte"&gt;Nathalie Comte. "Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World". Ed. Jonathan Dewald. Vol. 2. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004. p94-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early use of dance may have been as a precursor to [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] [[altered state of consciousness|trance states]] in healing rituals. Dance is still used for this purpose by many cultures from the Brazilian [[rainforest]] to the [[Kalahari Desert]].&lt;ref name='guenther'&gt;Guenther, Mathias Georg. 'The San Trance Dance: Ritual and Revitalization Among the Farm Bushmen of the Ghanzi District, Republic of Botswana.' Journal, South West Africa Scientific Society, v30, 1975-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early manuscript describing dance is the [[Natya Shastra]] on which is based the ''modern''  interpretation of [[classical Indian dance]] (e.g. [[Bharathanatyam]]).

== Greek mythology ==

In a classical Greek song, [[Apollo]], the god of medicine, music and poetry, one of the twelve greater gods and son of the chief god [[Zeus]], was called The Dancer. In a Greek line Zeus himself is represented as dancing.  [[Terpsichore]] is one of the nine Muses, representing dancing and dramatic chorus. In [[Sparta]], a province of ancient Greece, the law compelled parents to exercise their children in dancing from the age of five years.  They were led by grown men, and sang hymns and songs as they danced.  
In very early times a [[Greek chorus]], consisting of the whole population of the city, would meet in the market-place to offer up thanksgivings to the god of the country.  Their jubilees were always attended with hymn-singing and dancing.

==Dance in Scriptures==
The [[Torah]], the [[Psalms]], and many other scriptures reference dance:

[[Old Testament]]
*'''A Time to Dance:'''
**Ecclesiastes 3:4
*'''Social Dance in celebration of what God has done:'''
**Exodus 15:20;
**Judges 21:21 - 23
*'''In celebration before the Lord:'''
**2 Samuel 6:14-16;
**1 Chronicles 15:29
*'''Social dancing in celebration of a god:'''
**Exodus 32:19;
**1 Kings 18:26 (The act of celebrating a false god is condemned here)
*'''A child's dance:'''
**Judges 11:34;
**Job 21:11
*'''Celebration of warriors:'''
**1 Samuel 18:6-7;
**1 Samuel 21:11;
**1 Samuel 29:5;
*'''As an expression of happiness:'''
**Psalm 30:11;
**Lamentations 5:15;
*'''In Worship to the Lord:'''
**[[Psalm 149]]:3;
**[[Psalm 150]]:4
*'''Social Dance with Friends:'''
**Jeremiah 31:4;
**Jeremiah 31:13
*'''A Lovers Dance:'''
**Song of Solomon 6:13

[[New Testament]]
*'''Social Dance with Friends:'''
**Luke 15:25;
*'''Jesus uses dance as a metaphor'''
**Matthew 11:17
*'''For the king: '''
**'''Matthew 14:6 and Mark 6:22'''

===Hindu scriptures===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:classical Indian dance.jpg|right]] --&gt;
From a Hindu point of view, the whole Universe is being brought into existence as the manifestation of the dance of the Supreme Dancer, [[Nataraja]]. In the Hindu scriptures, every god has his or her own style ([[lasya]] and [[tandava]] respectively represent two aspects of dance) we read about 23 celestial beings called [[Apsaras]]es who dance to please the gods and express the supreme truths in the magic of movement.

The dance in the Hinduism used to be a part of a sacred temple ritual, especially in South and Eastern India, where the female priestesses [[devadasi]]'s worshiped different aspects of the Divine through the elaborate language of mime and gestures. [[Natyashastra]] is the most ancient and the most elaborate scripture describing every element and aspect of this sacred art-worship.

The temple dance gradually evolved into what is known today as the South Indian Classical Dance that still preserves many ritualistic elements of Hinduism. Some of the [[classical Indian dance]]rs are believed to be incarnations of apsaras.

===Buddhism===
See [[Seungmu]]

===Chinese mythology===
*[[Lion dance]]

===Christianity ===
In the [[Protoevangelium of James]], it is reported that [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]] danced before the [[Ark of the Covenant]] in the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] at the time of her [[Presentation of the Virgin|presentation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0847.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the history of Christianity, several denominations and independent congregations prohibited social dancing for various reasons;&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/dihtml/diessay8.html Western Social Dance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; however, dance has always been a part of the social life of many Christians. Christian lyrics are found in the sounds of Ballroom, Country, Rock and Roll, Latin, Night Club, and other dance music. [[Ballet]] originated in Italy at weddings.

Numerous examples of traditional dance can be found in modern [[Roman Catholic]] communities. The Brazilian dance and martial art of [[capoeira]] (particularly [[capoeira angola]]) is regularly performed—including between ''capoeiristas'' of different sexes—to lyrics and ''ladinhas'' (litanies) praising God, the saints, and the Virgin. In a similar vein, several genres of dance music in [[Romani people]]/[[Romani people|Romani]] culture involve religious themes and lyrics. In the Philippines, the ''[[Subli]]''&amp;mdash;a devotional dance of the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholic]] [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]] in [[Batangas (province)|Batangas Province]]&amp;mdash;honours the [[True Cross]]. Finally, the celebrations of [[Carnival]] and [[Mardi Gras]] feature dance.

Many [[Charismatic]] and [[Pentecostal]] [[Protestant]] denomonations practice dance during worship services. Congregants frequently dance during services as an act of worship. Some Charismatics practice [[prophetic dance]], a religious practice in which practitioners believe they are representing what the Lord is doing through their movements. This is often accompanied with banners, ribbons and, instruments. [[Bethel Church (Redding, California)|Bethel Church]] in [[Redding, California]] has a school where people who wished to be trained in prophetic dance can go.

A '''Dvarapala''' or '''Dvarapalaka''' ([[Sanskrit]], "door guard"; [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Dvārapāla}}'' {{IPA-sa|dʋaːɽəpaːlə}}) is a [[door]] or [[gate]] guardian often portrayed as a warrior or fearsome giant, usually armed with a weapon - the most common being the  [[Gada (mace)|''gada'']] (mace). The dvarapala [[statue]] is a widespread [[architecture|architectural element]] throughout [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] cultures, as well as in areas influenced by them like [[Java]].

==Names==
In most southeast Asian languages (including [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]],  [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]]), these protective figures are referred to as ''dvarapala''. Sanskrit ''dvāra'' means "gate" or "door", and ''pāla'' means "guard" or "protector".

The related name in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malaysian language|Malaysia]] is ''dwarapala''. Equivalent door guardians in northern Asian languages are  ''Kongōrikishi'' or ''[[Nio|Niō]]''  in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], ''Heng Ha Er Jiang'' in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and ''Narayeongeumgang'' in [[Korean language|Korean]].

==Origin and forms==
{{doubleimage|right|Sculpture of Jaya, guardian to the entrance of the sanctum of Vishnu in Chennakeshava temple at Belur.jpg|130|Sculpture of Vijaya, guardian to the entrance of the sanctum of Vishnu in Chennakeshava temple at Belur.jpg|170|[[Jaya-Vijaya]] - the Dvarapalas of the god [[Vishnu]]'s abode [[Vaikuntha]] are often depicted his temples, guarding the doors. Here they are guarding the sanctum of the Vishnu temple, [[Chennakesava Temple]].}}
Dvarapalas as an architectural feature have their origin in [[tutelary deities]], like [[Yaksha]] and [[warrior]] figures, such as [[Acala]], of the local popular religion.&lt;ref&gt;Helena A. van Bemmel, ''Dvārapālas in Indonesia: temple guardians and acculturation By Helena A. van Bemmel'', {{ISBN|978-90-5410-155-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today some dvarapalas are even figures of policemen or soldiers standing guard.

These statues were traditionally placed outside Buddhist or Hindu temples, as well as other structures like [[royal palace]]s, to protect the holy places inside. A dvarapala is usually portrayed as an armed fearsome guardian looking like a [[demon]], but at the gates of Buddhist temples in [[Sri Lanka]], dvarapalas often display average [[human]] features. In other instances a fierce-looking [[nāga]] snake figure may perform the same function. 

The sculptures in [[Java]] and [[Bali]], usually carved from [[andesite]], portray dvarapalas as fearsome giants with a rather bulky physique in semi kneeling position and holding a [[club (weapon)|club]]. The largest dvarapala stone statue in Java, a dvarapala of the [[Singhasari]] period, is 3.7 meters tall. The traditional dvarapalas of Cambodia and Thailand, on the other hand, are leaner and portrayed in a standing position holding the club downward in the center.

The ancient sculpture of dvarapala in Thailand is made of a high-fired [[stoneware]] [[clay]] covered with a pale, almost milky [[celadon]] [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]]. [[Ceramic art|Ceramic sculptures]] of this type were produced in [[Thailand]], during the [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya periods]], between the 14th and 16th centuries, at several [[kiln]] complexes located in [[northern Thailand]]. &lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art]], Gainesville, Florida&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the size and wealth of the temple, the guardians could be placed singly, in pairs or in larger groups. Smaller structures may have had only one dvarapala. Often there was a pair placed on either side of the threshold to the [[shrine]]. Some larger sites may have had four ([[Guardians of the directions#Lokapālas|lokapālas]], guardians of the four [[cardinal direction]]s), eight, or 12. In some cases only the fierce face or head of the guardian is represented, a figure very common in the [[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]]s in Java.

'''Everlöv Church''' ({{lang-sv|Everlövs kyrka}}) is a medieval [[Lutheran]] church built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style. Located some {{convert|14| km|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Sjöbo]] in southern [[Sweden]], it belongs to the [[Diocese of Lund]]. The church is noted for the many frescos which decorate the vaulted ceilings in the nave and the chancel.

==History and architecture==
The present church was built in the 12th century, replacing an earlier wooden church. It stands on a site that was used as an ancient place of worship. In the 13th century, a broad tower was built at the west end of the building.&lt;ref name=loa&gt;[http://www.formonline.se/kyrkor/Everlov/ Lars-Olof Albertson, "Everlövs kyrka"], Medeltida konst, FormOnLine. {{sv icon}} Retrieved 3 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior==
[[File:Eva och Adam får verktyg, Everlövs kyrka.jpg|thumb|Frescos depicting the story of Adam and Eve]] 
The church originally had a flat wooden ceiling. In the 15th century, it replaced with vaults. As the nave was unusually wide, two columns were built in the centre of the nave to support them. As a result, six vaults, each with four segments, were built in the nave in addition to a vault with four segments in the [[chancel]].&lt;ref name=loa/&gt; The Baroque [[altarpiece]] and [[pulpit]] are from 1626.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyrkokartan.se/058411/Everlövs_kyrka "Everlövs kyrka"], Kyrkokartan.se. {{sv icon}} Retrieved 3 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frescos==
The [[Church frescos in Sweden|frescos]] were painted in about 1500 by the so-called Everlöv Workshop which bears strong similarities to the [[Brarup Church|Brarup]] and [[Elmelunde Master|Elmelunde Workshop]]s in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Billedkunst,_gotisk/V%C3%A6rksteder_m.m./Everl%C3%B6vv%C3%A6rkstedet "Everlövværkstedet"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 3 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The vaults in the chancel are decorated with paintings of the four Evangelists. Those in the nave include the Creation, Adam and Eve, Lazarus, the Nativity and the seven deadly sins.&lt;ref name=loa/&gt;

[[File:CDC Graphic Artists at Work.jpg|right|thumb|Graphic artists at work during the 1960s]]
A category of [[fine art]], '''graphic art''' covers a broad range of visual artistic expression, typically two-dimensional, i.e. produced on a flat surface.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/art/graphic-art Graphic art]." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Britannica.com. Retrieved 2016-02-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The term usually refers to the arts that rely more on line or tone than on colour, especially [[drawing]] and the various forms of [[engraving]];&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;"Graphic art." ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art''. 3rd ed.  Ed. Ian Chilvers. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; it is sometimes understood to refer specifically to [[printmaking]] processes,&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; such as [[line engraving]],  [[aquatint]], [[drypoint]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]], [[monotyping|monotype]], [[lithography]], and [[screen printing]] (silk-screen, serigraphy).&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Ralph (1992). "Graphic arts, or graphics." ''The HarperCollins Dictionary of Art Terms and Techniques''. 2nd ed. Revised and edited by Steven Sheehan. New York: Harper Perennial. p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Graphic art further includes [[calligraphy]], [[photography]], [[painting]], [[typography]], [[computer graphics]], and [[bindery]]. It also encompasses drawn plans and layouts for interior and architectural designs.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

==History==
Throughout history, technological inventions have shaped the development of graphic art. In 2500 BC, the Egyptians used graphic symbols to communicate their thoughts in a written form known as [[hieroglyphics]]. The Egyptians wrote and illustrated narratives on rolls of papyrus to share the stories and art with others.&lt;ref name="Meggs"&gt;{{cite web|first=Philip B.|last=Meggs|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1032864/graphic-design |title=Graphic design|work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-03-05 |accessdate=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, scribes [[scriptorium|manually copied]] each individual page of manuscripts to maintain their sacred teachings. The scribes would leave marked sections of the page available for artists to [[illuminated manuscript|insert drawings and decorations]]. Using art alongside the carefully lettered text enhanced the religious reading experience.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"&gt;McGuire-Lyle, Erin.  ''Careers in the Graphic Arts and Computer Graphics'' (Career Resource Library). June 2000. New York: Rosen Publishing Group, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented an improved movable type mechanical device known as the [[printing press]] in 1450, the first outside of Asia. His printing press facilitated the mass-production of text and graphic art and eventually, replaced manual transcriptions altogether.

Again during the Renaissance years, graphic art in the form of printing played a major role in the spread of classical learning in Europe. Within these manuscripts, book designers focused heavily on [[typeface]].

Due to the development of larger fonts during the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[posters]] became a popular form of graphic art used to communicate the latest information as well as to advertise the latest products and services.

The invention and popularity of [[film]] and [[television]] changed graphic art through the additional aspect of motion as advertising agencies attempted to use kinetics to their advantage.

The next major change in graphic arts came when the personal [[computer]] was invented in the twentieth century. Powerful computer software enables artists to manipulate images in a much faster and simpler way than the skills of board artists prior to the 1990s. With quick calculations, computers easily recolor, scale, rotate, and rearrange images if the programs are known.&lt;ref name="Meggs"/&gt;

The scientific investigations into legibility has influenced such things as the design of street signs. New York City is in the process of changing out all of its street signs bearing all capital letters for replacement with signs bearing only upper and lower case letters. They estimate that the increased legibility will facilitate way-finding and reduce crashes and injuries significantly.

== Graphic design software ==
{{off topic|date=October 2013}}
[[File:Vacation Rentals In Hawaii Image.jpg|thumb|Example of graphic arts created with the free tool, Paint.net.]]
Graphic artists applying for positions in today's job market are expected to be familiar with computers and a variety of software programs in order to create the most appealing, up to date designs.

Graphic art software includes applications such as:
*[[Adobe Dreamweaver]] – a tool that facilitates the creation of webpages and dynamic internet content
*[[Adobe Illustrator]] – an application that allows artists to manipulate vector graphics
*[[Adobe InDesign]] – desktop publishing software used for layout and design manipulation
*[[Adobe Photoshop]] – a bitmap graphics software including powerful graphics editing tools that provide a large variety of editing functionality
*[[CorelDRAW]] – similar to Adobe Illustrator, it is another vector graphic manipulation tool
*[[PhotoImpact]] – a digital photograph editor
*[[QuarkXPress]] – similar to Adobe InDesign, it is another computer publishing software tool

===Free software===
*[[Paint.net]] – photograph editing capabilities with lots of plugins to expand use
*[[GIMP]] – similar to paint.net and Photoshop
*[[Inkscape]] – similar to Illustrator

Beside computers and software, graphic artists are also expected to be creative with processing camera work, registration, crop marks, and masking.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"/&gt;

== Careers ==
{{howto|date=October 2013}}
One of the most common career paths for a graphic artist today is web design. With the popularity of the [[World Wide Web]], the demand for web designers is immense. Graphic artists use their creativity with layouts, typography, and [[logos]] to market the products or services of the client’s business. In addition to creating graphical designs, graphic artists also need to understand hypertext, web programming, and web page maintenance in order to successfully create a web page.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"/&gt; The responsibility for effective communication also falls under the auspices of the graphic designer.

The '''Musée de l'Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire''' or '''IFAN Museum of African Arts''' in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] is one of the oldest art museums in [[West Africa]]. It was promoted by [[Léopold Senghor]], the country's first President. In December 2007, its official title was changed to '''The Théodore Monod African Art Museum''' ("Musée Théodore Monod d'Art africain"), after the French naturalist [[Théodore André Monod]], former director of IFAN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausenegal.com/+Le-musee-de-l-IFAN-change-de+.html Le musée de l’IFAN change de dénomination, ausenegal.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218020238/http://www.ausenegal.com/+Le-musee-de-l-IFAN-change-de+.html |date=2008-02-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously its official name had been "''Le Musée d'Art africain de l'Institut fondamental d'Afrique noire Cheikh Anta Diop IFAN/CAD''".

The museum is part of the [[Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire]] (IFAN) institute, founded 1936  under the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government in France. When IFAN was transferred to [[Cheikh Anta Diop University]] in 1960, the building at Place Soweto near the [[National Assembly of Senegal]] was converted into a museum. It is today one of the most prestigious centers for the study of African culture and part of the [[Cheikh Anta Diop University]].  As the main cultural research center of the colonies of [[French West Africa]], it contains important collections from across Francophone Africa.

The museum is one of the regular locations used in the [[Dakar Biennale]] exhibition, showing art by contemporary African and diaspora artists.&lt;ref&gt;''Assembling Africa — Dak'art 96 biennial art festival, various artists, various venues, Dakar, Senegal'', in Art in America, May 1997 accessed at [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n5_v85/ai_19385178] March 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dak'Art 2006: positions and perspectives'', in African Arts, Winter 2006 accessed at [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0438/is_4_39/ai_n17094470/pg_10] March 2, 2007&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.osiris.sn/article2324.html  DAK’ART 2006 - Yacouba Konaté, Commissaire général de la Biennale de l’art africain contemporain : « L’art numérique n’est pas décalé, mais le public a le droit d’être un peu surpris »], Babacar DIOP : Le Quotidien, 5 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Israel Painters and Sculptors Association''' was established in 1934 and has been associated with many painters and sculptors who worked in Israel. With the establishment of the State of Israel, the name of the association was changed to the "Association of Painters and Sculptors in Israel". In 2002, the name was changed again to "Painters and Sculptors Association ([[Tel Aviv]])" and three independent associations of painters and sculptors were established in [[Jerusalem Artists House|Jerusalem]], Haifa and Be'er Sheva.

== Hebrew Artists Association ==
The association was founded in October 1920 by the Association of Hebrew Artists, in its committee were the following artists: Meir Gur-Arie, S. Ben-David, [[Abel Pann]], Avraham Melnikov and Shmuel Opel. The aim of the association was to "develop and disseminate among the people the arts, the art work and taste and beauty in the Hebrew spirit." In April 1921 the members of the association presented an exhibition at the [[Tower of David]].

Since 1923, the association has exhibited 19 different group exhibitions. These were eclectic exhibitions with many works of art on various artistic levels. Alongside these exhibitions, occasional group exhibitions were held on a commercial or artistic basis.

In addition, the Society created the Painting and Sculpture Section of the journal "Theater and Art" which was published in 1927.

== Association of Painters and Sculptors ==
On August 4, 1934, the first convention of the Association of Painters and Sculptors was held in Tel Aviv. There was talk about building a pavilion for exhibitions and a permanent exhibition, establishing a cooperative of painters, a club, mutual help and housing for the members of the association. A committee was chosen, composed of [[Chaim Gliksberg]], [[Nahum Gutman]], Newman, Avni, Yishai Kolbiansky, Leoben and Eliahu Sigard. Gliksberg was the association secretary. On August 14, a parallel assembly was held in Jerusalem, in which a committee was appointed that included [[Zeev Ben Zvi]], Meir Gur-Arie and [[Jacob Steinhardt]].

One of the association's exhibitions, "The Eighth Exhibition," took place in December 1942 at [[Habima Theatre]], where the works of [[Arie Aroch]], Aharon Giladi, Zvi Meirovitch, Avraham Natan (Nathanson), [[Avigdor Stematsky]] and [[Yehezkel Streichman]] were exhibited. Another sculptor, [[Dov Feigin]] appeared in the catalog but did not participate in the exhibition at last. Another exhibition – "The Shiva Exhibition" – took place in 1947 at the [[Tel Aviv Museum]], with the participation of Aroch, Giladi, Meirovitch, Natan, Streichman, Jacob Wexler and [[Yosef Zaritsky]]. In these exhibitions, the artists aspired to the creation of modern art under European influence and to create "an original style, rooted in our reality." In these exhibitions, although they did not establish a clear artistic platform, there was a tendency to emphasize the painterly means. In addition, these exhibitions symbolized a certain separation and a "positive appearance" of the artists against the background of the "generalism" regime ... which helps blur the boundaries and dimensions, in order to impose mediocrity "

In 1948,[[Yosef Zaritsky]] served as chairman of the association, and when an invitation came to present an exhibition of Israeli artists in the Italian pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]], he chose not to share the list of participating artists because of his concern about the selection of medium-sized artists. In the wake of the accusations, several artists, including [[Moshe Castel]], Streichman and [[Yohanan Simon]], announced their immediate retirement from the association, and they established with Zaritsky the "[[Ofakim Hadashim]]".

From 1964 to 1967, [[Ruth Horam]] served as the chairperson of the Association

From 1969 to 1981, [[Alexander Bogen]] served as chairman of the Association.

In the years 1989–2005, Rachel Shavit-Bentwich served as chairperson of the Association and as Chairperson of the Honorary Council.

The '''Jāmeh Mosque of Isfahān''' or '''Jāme' Mosque of Isfahān''' ({{lang-fa|مسجد جامع اصفهان}} – ''Masjid-e-Jāmeh Isfahān'') is the grand, congregational mosque ([[Jameh Mosque|Jāmeh]]) of [[Isfahān]] city, within [[Isfahān Province]], [[Iran]]. The mosque is the result of continual construction, reconstruction, additions and renovations on the site from around 771 to the end of the 20th century. The [[Qeysarriyeh Bazaar|Grand Bazaar of Isfahan]] can be found towards the southwest wing of the mosque. It has been a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Properties inscribed on the World Heritage List, Iran | publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ir | accessdate=27 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Built during the [[Umayyad dynasty]], it is rumored in Isfahan that one of the pillars of this Mosque were personally built by the Caliph in [[Damascus]].  Prior to it becoming a Mosque, it is said to have been a house of worship for [[Zoroastrians]].

==Specifications==
This is one of the oldest mosques still standing in Iran, and it was built in the four-''iwan'' architectural style, placing four gates face to face. An ''[[iwan]]'' is a vaulted open room. The ''[[qibla]] iwan'' on the southern side of the mosque was vaulted with ''[[muqarnas]]'' during the 13th century. ''Muqarnas'' are niche-like cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Art: a Brief History |last=Stokstad |first=Marilyn |edition=3rd |year=2007 |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=Upper Saddle River |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction under the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] included the addition of two brick domed chambers, for which the mosque is renowned. The south dome was built to house the mihrab in 1086–87 by [[Nizam al-Mulk]], the famous vizier of [[Malik Shah I|Malik Shah]], and was larger than any dome known at its time. The north dome was constructed a year later by Nizam al-Mulk's rival [[Taj al-Mulk]]. The function of this domed chamber is uncertain. Although it was situated along the north-south axis, it was located outside the boundaries of the mosque. The dome was certainly built as a direct riposte to the earlier south dome, and successfully so, claiming its place as a masterpiece in Persian architecture for its structural clarity and geometric balance. Iwans were also added in stages under the Seljuqs, giving the mosque its current four-iwan form, a type which subsequently became prevalent in Iran and the rest of the Islamic world.&lt;ref name="O'Kane"&gt;O'Kane, Bernard (1995). [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/domes Domes]. ''Encyclopaedia Iranica'', Online Edition. Retrieved 28 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to functional needs of the space, political ambition, religious developments, and changes in taste, further additions and modifications took place incorporating elements from the Mongols, Muzzafarids, Timurids and Safavids. Of note is the elaborately carved stucco mihrab commissioned in 1310 by Mongol ruler [[Oljaytu]], located in a side prayer hall built within the western arcade. [[Safavid]] intervention was largely decorative, with the addition of muqarnas, glazed tilework, and minarets flanking the south iwan.

The cupolas and piers that form the hypostyle area between the iwans are undated and varied in style, endlessly modified with repairs, reconstructions and additions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.tcl?site_id=2305 Archnet Digital Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311052546/http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.tcl?site_id=2305 |date=11 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of this mosque lie in the 8th century, but it burnt down and was rebuilt again in the 11th century during the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] dynasty and went through remodeling many times. As a result, it has rooms built in different architectural styles, so now the mosque represents a condensed history of Iranian Architecture.

'''Linda Carter'''&lt;!-- Do not add nee Peacock, she is created not born and has never been credited with the name --&gt; is a fictional character from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Kellie Bright]]. She first appeared on 19 December 2013 and her casting was announced alongside her on-screen partner, [[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]). Linda was introduced by new executive producer [[Dominic Treadwell-Collins]] as part of the [[Carter family (EastEnders)|Carter family]].

Linda's storylines include her feud with [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), coming to terms with her youngest son [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny]] ([[Sam Strike]]/[[Ted Reilly]]) being gay, being [[rape]]d by Mick's brother [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) and coping in the aftermath, giving birth to a premature baby after falling down the stairs, suffering from [[bulimia nervosa]], being in denial of the possibility that her baby son [[Ollie Carter]] could have brain damage, leaving to care for her mother [[Elaine Peacock]] ([[Maria Friedman]]) following her [[stroke]], discovering that Mick kissed their daughter-in-law [[Whitney Dean|Whitney Carter]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) and revealing that she has secretly battled [[cervical cancer]] before being involved in an ambulance crash when Johnny is shot and [[perverting the course of justice]] when [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]) is shot leading to her being falsely accused of [[attempted murder]].

==Storylines==
Linda first appears when her partner Mick's sister, Shirley and Tina, visit her mother [[Elaine Peacock]]'s ([[Maria Friedman]]) pub in Watford, where Linda and her family are living. They intend to ask Mick for a loan but Linda rejects them as Mick is not around. As revenge, Tina steals the money from a bingo jar but Shirley returns it, proving her honesty to Mick, and also recommends The Queen Victoria (The Vic) as a potential pub of their own on [[Albert Square]] in [[Walford]], where Shirley lives. Mick purchases the pub from [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), who is at first unaware of his identity, and Mick, Linda, their son [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny Carter]] ([[Sam Strike]]) and their dog, [[Lady Di (EastEnders)|Lady Di]] (Hot Lips), move in and start trading. Linda continues to clash with Shirley, who moves in with them, and she befriends [[Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) over their mutual dislike of Shirley. Linda and Mick receive an invite to their daughter [[Nancy Carter]]'s ([[Maddy Hill]]) wedding to [[Wayne Ladlow]] ([[Malachi Kirby]]), a troublemaker, but they disapprove so Mick forcibly removes her from the wedding service. In the following argument, Nancy reveals that Johnny is gay, and has been hiding his sexuality in fear of how his parents will react. Linda refuses to accept that he is gay and encourages him to date [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), who shows an interest in him. Mick, along with Shirley and Tina, visit their estranged father [[Stan Carter]] ([[Timothy West]]) for money, and reunite with him in the process. He moves into the pub when he breaks his ankle and becomes immobile, and, despite initially clashing with him, Linda warms to having him around.

Linda's friendship with Sharon comes under strain when Sharon reveals plans to open a new bar in Walford, named "The Albert". Realising it will be in direct competition to The Vic, she plots to get inside knowledge about the bar, convincing Johnny to take a job there. However, Johnny likes the job and tells her that he does not want to feed information to her. Linda and Mick's eldest son, [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]), returns from Afghanistan, where he has been serving in the army. He is grieving for a comrade he has lost, and Linda is a comfort and support to him. Shirley's estranged son [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) comes to Walford, and although he continues to share a troubled relationship with his mother, he is welcomed by Mick and Linda into the family. Dean develops feelings for Linda, which she is at first unaware of, but discovers when he gropes her buttocks at a photoshoot for his new salon. She warns him that it is inappropriate but does not tell Mick out of fear of angering him.

Tina encourages Johnny to embrace his sexuality, inviting him to [[gay pride]] in London. Linda continues to be uncomfortable with this, and attempts to sabotage his plans by making him work. However, he realises what she is doing and in the ensuing argument he leaves home. Stan takes Linda to his old flat where Johnny is staying, and, after some tough love from Stan about her past, she apologises to Johnny and drops him off at gay pride, giving him her blessing. The following week, Linda has a party for her birthday, and Lee returns permanently from Afghanistan in time for the celebrations. After the party, Linda and Mick have a heart to heart, and he asks her to marry him properly, but she declines, determined to keep up the pretence to their children that they are already married. This conversation is overheard by Dean, who agrees to keep quiet.

Linda supports Mick when he participates in a swimming gala for [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]), despite being fearful of water. Mick conquers his fears, but on the way home he is arrested for [[soliciting]] a [[prostitute]]. He tells Linda that the police are making a mistake as it was in fact his friend [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), that was speaking with the prostitute; he pulled over merely to see what was going on. Stan's girlfriend, [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]) overhears the conversation and accompanies Linda to Mick's hearing, and Linda is devastated when he pleads guilty to protect Ian, who is going through a tough time following the death of his daughter, [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]). Linda agrees to keep quiet, but Cora has a change of heart about supporting Linda and reveals Mick's offence to the whole pub, running his name through the mud. Unable to cope with the negative social stigma surrounding her family, Linda demands that Mick reveals the truth, but he refuses, wanting to keep his word to Ian. However, the truth is revealed when the prostitute, who is revealed to be Cora's estranged daughter [[Rainie Cross]] ([[Tanya Franks]]), bumps into Ian's partner [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and reveals the truth. Denise visits Linda, struggling with the revelation, and Linda lies that she only just found out about Ian's actions. Ian however reveals the truth to Denise, who accuses Linda of attention seeking. One evening, Dean kisses Linda but she slaps him. Distraught over the upset that Mick's actions have brought her family, Linda leaves Walford to stay with Elaine in Watford. She returns, reconciling with Mick, before Sharon and Phil's wedding. When Sharon suggests that Dean's advances towards Linda were encouraged, both drunk, they have a bitter row in the pub. Then Sharon tells Nancy about the kiss, so Nancy accuses Dean and Linda of having an affair.

Shirley flees from Walford after the wedding, leaving Dean upset. Mick asks Linda to comfort him, but, misunderstanding her reassurance and very drunk, Dean rapes her. She becomes very withdrawn, telling nobody and refusing to be intimate with Mick. Trying to get to the bottom of what is going on, he calls Linda's mother, Elaine, asking her to visit The Vic to help him understand her behaviour. Elaine makes some progress before leaving again. Mick theorises that Linda is pregnant when she vomits at the smell of lavender bath soap, and she, is horrified to discover he is correct, when she takes a test. She lies to Mick about the result and plans to have an abortion, but Mick finds out and she agrees to keep the baby. She is disturbed when Dean finds out, and tries to hang onto the belief that the baby is Mick's. [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) bumps into Linda who asks her about her relationship with Dean, Linda nearly admits that Dean raped her however she is stopped from doing so when they are interrupted by Dean. However, Stacey grows suspicious, and when Linda unexpectedly gets scared when Dean is around, Stacey surmises that Dean raped her and confronts Linda. When Stacey depicts how she felt after her rape, Linda accepts that he did. Johnny announces he is leaving Walford to travel with Gianluca, although initially upset, Linda decides to support him.

Linda, feeling increasingly threatened by Dean, turns down Mick's Christmas Day proposal before stunning Mick by revealing the rape. Later that day he confronts Dean who lies, saying that he and Linda were having an affair. Mick attacks Dean forcing Shirley's revelation—Dean is his brother. Linda eavesdrops while Mick, Tina, Shirley, Babe and Stan argue, only to hear Mick deny that Dean is part of the family. Mick tells them that Dean raped Linda, but she overhears. Without saying anything, Linda leaves the pub. Mick leaves messages on her voicemail to ask her to come home and Elaine returns her to the pub. When she attempts to find solace in Sharon's home, Mick joins her, and she says they should not let what happened get in the way of their relationship. They are about to return to the pub when Mick has second thoughts and he decides to take Linda away for a break.  When they return a few weeks later, they find Shirley helping to run the pub so Mick asks her to leave. When Mick accompanies her to the police station, Linda reports Dean for rape. She then fills Nancy and Lee in on recent events, having already told Elaine and Sharon. Dean is arrested by the police but released after questioning and accuses Linda of lying. Linda proposes to Mick who accepts. The next day, Nancy confesses to her that Mick choked Dean unconscious in the cellar and is being secretive about what happened. Elaine returns for Mick and Linda's engagement party, while Linda confronts Mick, who assures her that he did not kill Dean, although, later, Nancy tries to tell Shirley something about Dean, but collapses on the ground before she can do so. After Elaine returns for Linda's five-month scan the day after, Linda confesses to her her fears that the baby may not be Mick's. Linda organises a romantic picnic as a fresh start for her and Mick. Linda is devastated to learn that Dean will not be charged due to lack of evidence. Linda pleads with Dean to admit he raped her but just as she seems to be making leeway, Mick interrupts.

Linda falls down the stairs, causing her to go into premature labour. She gives birth to a healthy son, [[Ollie Carter]] (Jack Tilley). Linda confronts a delusional Dean when he insists on meeting the baby, believing that Ollie is his son. Mick discovers that he, Linda and Ollie share the same blood type, but Dean does not, meaning Dean cannot be the father. Linda and Mick agree they should marry soon. On her return home with Mick and Ollie, Linda snubs an apologetic Dean's attempt to shake her hand. When Linda and Nancy return from holiday, Linda learns that Lee has been suffering from depression, and she encourages him to take his medication. Elaine moves in temporarily, which initially causes consternation when she interferes with running the pub. Mick arranges for Linda to go to a wedding fair in Birmingham, and when she returns, she discovers that Mick and Shirley have been seeing each other in secret, which upsets Linda. After making herself sick one day, she tells Mick she cannot get married. Eventually, she tells him she hates herself and, because of Dean, she feels the same way she did when she suffered from [[bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] after her father died, and has been making herself sick again. However, she agrees to marry Mick with his support. When Dean attempts to rape his fiancée [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), Linda encourages her to report this to the police. During a heated exchange with Linda where Shirley is present, Dean admits that he raped Linda. Stunned, Linda tells Mick, while Dean goes into hiding, where he sees one of Mick and Linda's wedding invites. Dean goes to the wedding venue and attempts to drown Shirley, jumping into the lake with her. Mick fights with Dean in the lake and he is knocked unconscious. Mick rescues him and resuscitates him, and he is arrested for the attempted rape of Roxy.  Afterwards, Linda and Mick marry. When they return from their honeymoon, Whitney kisses Mick, saying she has feelings for him, so he tells Linda what happened. Linda tells Whitney to keep away from Mick and not to give up on Lee.

Nancy and Lee have an argument, which causes Ollie (now Charlie Harrington) to fall off his highchair. Mick and Linda do not witness this, and when Mick insists they should get Ollie to hospital, Linda states he seems fine, but she later finds Ollie is not breathing. She successfully resuscitates him, only for him to suffer a seizure. Ollie is taken to hospital where a doctor tells the Carters that he could have brain damage after a head injury. Linda, in denial about the severity of Ollie's condition, argues with Mick, especially when he blames Nancy for the incident, however, she soon realises that Mick is right about Ollie having changed when he does not respond to her in the usual way. Linda is delighted by Johnny's (now [[Ted Reilly]]) return but saddened by Nancy's departure. Linda is devastated when Dean is acquitted but tells Mick she has become a strong person and that their relationship has become stronger. The Carters are later devastated when a pregnant Whitney suffers a [[miscarriage]] but are delighted when Lee and Whitney get married. The Carters are traumatised by a violent robbery on The Vic, during which Linda's favourite necklace is stolen. Linda is inspired to make Christmas great as a result, and is overjoyed when Ollie takes his first steps. Linda is devastated to learn that Elaine has had a stroke in Spain on Christmas Eve, and she flies out there with Johnny to support her mother. Later, Johnny returns to Walford while Linda relocates with Elaine to Watford to aid her mother's recovery. Mick visits Linda and informs her that Babe has caused the pub to be fined £20,000 because of her selling alcohol illegally outside of licensing hours. When Mick struggles to cope with the pub's mounting debts, [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) calls Linda, worried about Mick. Linda returns the following day and Mick informs her of Lee's departure and the debts he left. Linda initially blames Whitney and an argument ensues, causing Whitney to leave. Mick explains to Linda that it was Lee's fault, causing another argument, although they make up and have sex. After a heart-to-heart with Whitney, Linda decides to return to Elaine, which angers Mick as Linda saw the state he was in and left anyway. Linda then sends [[Woody Woodward (EastEnders)|Woody Woodward]] ([[Lee Ryan]]) to work in The Vic as a bar manager. With Lady Di needing an expensive operation and mounting debts, Shirley convinces Linda to sell the freehold of The Vic, and they agree not to tell Mick. Linda signs the paperwork and Shirley forges Mick's signature. Linda returns to Walford for her birthday and meets [[Fi Browning]] ([[Lisa Faulkner]]), The Vic's business consultant sent by the freeholder, Grafton Hill, and with the changes, she feels that The Vic is not her home. She leaves again in the middle of the night, saying Elaine has fallen, but she is fine and Linda tells Elaine that she could not talk to Mick.

Two months later, Mick phones Linda, telling her to come back home or else there will be nothing to come back to. When Linda and Ollie (now Harry Farr) return, she is surprised when she discovers the amount of changes that have happened. When Linda discovers that Mick has been fighting in the pub, Shirley tells her that he has struggled with her prolonged absence and Linda admits that she has neglected him. When Linda is seemingly about to tell Mick about her secret, Mick admits to her that he is in love with someone else. Linda realises it is Whitney and throws her out, while Mick begs her not to give up on their marriage. Linda agrees to reconcile but is furious when Mick admits he paid Whitney off, so she slaps him. Following a conversation with Fi, Linda offers Whitney her job back but she also defies Fi by rehiring [[Tracey (EastEnders)|Tracey]] ([[Jane Slaughter]]). After confiding in Denise about Mick's infatuation, Denise tells Linda that she saw Mick and Whitney kiss several months previously. Linda then learns that Fi nearly kissed Mick. Linda considers leaving Walford with Ollie, however, she talks to [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) and reveals that Elaine's stroke was not severe and she recovered relatively quickly, but that Linda stayed away from Walford because she had been diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]] while caring for Elaine. Jack accompanies Linda to a check-up where she is told that there are no signs of cancer in her body but there is a chance it could come back, so she is unsure if she should tell Mick, but she does so. They go on holiday to rekindle their marriage and when they return, Linda is delighted that Whitney and Woody are emigrating, but Woody leaves without Whitney, so Linda is annoyed. Mick asks Linda to renew their wedding vows and she accepts, though has doubts after seeing Mick comforting Whitney. The Carters attempt to raise money after Grafton Hill tell them they need to pay £60,000 in repair costs or face eviction, though Fi tells them she has reduced it to £50,000. They raise the money but Fi's father, [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]), reveals he now owns the business and Fi denies reducing the debt. James gives an eviction notice to the Carters, giving them a month to leave. After James collapses due to a heart attack, Fi gives the Carters a chance to buy back the freehold for the Vic for £150,000. Linda rejects this offer, calling it unrealistic and telling her that her family will get their comeuppance. However, Mick is determined to find the money to keep the pub and signs up to participate in a robbery with [[Aidan Maguire]] ([[Patrick Bergin]]) and his gang on New Year's Day Linda is distraught when Mick is shot by [[Halfway (EastEnders)|Halfway]] ([[Tony Clay]]), an army friend of Lee's during the robbery. However, Mick recovers with the help of Linda, [[Mariam Ahmed]] and a remorseful Halfway, who offers to help out at the pub. Several days later, Mick finds an expensive ring in Halfway's possession and interrogates Halfway, who admits he stole it from the robbery. Halfway gives the ring to the Carters, who then give the ring to Fi in exchange for the freehold for the pub. However, Aidan becomes suspicious of this and attempts to blackmail Mick into letting him use the pub for drug dealing. Aidan steps up his demands, repeatedly forcing him to accept money for these drug deals despite Linda returning it. The Carters decide to flee Walford to escape Aidan, who shows up and beats Mick up for not giving into his demands. However, Phil stops Aidan at the last minute and pressures him into leaving Walford or he'll reveal to the police that he killed Fi's brother [[Luke Browning]] (Adam Astill). Aidan calls off the drug deals, giving the Carters back control of the Vic.

Halfway's brother and Mick's longtime friend, [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]), arrives. Tina reveals that he abused her and another person [[Dylan Box]] ([[Ricci Harnett]]) when they were teenagers, and she attacks him. Stuart seeks revenge on the Carters and one night, Stuart is shot in the Vic. Linda initially thinks Mick shot Stuart so she dumps the gun in the canal after she finds it in the bar but she is seen by [[Keanu Taylor]] ([[Danny Walters]]). Mick tells Linda he is innocent and she worries whether she did the right thing, though Mick reassures her. The next day, Linda is arrested for Stuart's attempted murder. However, when Stuart regains consciousness, he tells the police that Mick shot him, and Mick is arrested and remanded. Linda ends their relationship when he admits he started smothering Stuart and tells Stuart she believes that Mick shot him. Linda and Stuart begin meeting regularly and become close despite the family's protests. She tells the family she thinks Mick is guilty, throws away her wedding rings, and later throws the family out, then allows Stuart to move in, and calls a solicitor to begin divorce proceedings from Mick. When Shirley breaks into the pub to confront Linda over being manipulated by Stuart, Linda calls the police and they arrest Shirley. She is released the next day and attacks Stuart. Linda takes Shirley aside and secretly shows her that she has hidden her wedding rings in her bra: her close friendship with Stuart is actually part of a bigger plan to help get Mick out of prison as she still loves Mick and believes he is innocent.

==Creation==
Linda was introduced as the wife of [[Mick Carter]], played by [[Danny Dyer]], the brother of established character [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), who has appeared in ''[[EastEnders]]'' since 2006. [[Luisa Bradshaw-White]] joined the cast as Shirley's sister [[Tina Carter]] in early November, and Linda was the second new Carter to appear after her. Kellie Bright's casting was announced alongside Danny Dyer's on 1 October 2013, a week after Bradshaw-White's casting was revealed. Linda was described as having been with Mick since they were teenagers, and despite not being 'blessed with brains', is a 'tough woman who will always fight tooth and nail for her family - especially her children'.&lt;ref name="Dyer and Bright castings"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a519737/eastenders-danny-dyer-to-play-new-queen-vic-landlord.html#~oOy9Z4ZVTPyPib|title='EastEnders': Danny Dyer to play new Queen Vic landlord|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=1 October 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bright previously appeared as a bridesmaid in 1986 at the wedding of [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]) and [[Lofty Holloway]] ([[Tom Watt (actor)|Tom Watt]]), and starred in scenes opposite her current co-star [[Letitia Dean]], who continues to appear as [[Sharon Watts]]. Bright estimated herself to be aged 10 at the time.&lt;ref name="Bright auditioned for Tanya Branning role" /&gt; She also auditioned for the role of [[Tanya Branning]] in 2006, a role that was eventually given to [[Jo Joyner]].&lt;ref name="Bright auditioned for Tanya Branning role" /&gt;

Linda first appeared in an episode that aired on [[BBC One]] on 19 December 2013, visited by her partner Mick's sisters Shirley and Tina when they needed money. Linda rejected them. She made her full arrival on 26 December 2013, the [[Boxing Day]] episode for ''EastEnders'', moving into her new home on [[Albert Square]], The Queen Victoria. Mick and Linda became the landlord and landlady of their pub, positions they still hold as of today. In a poll held by Digital Spy a month after the introduction of the Carters, Linda was the least popular, with 5.65% of the vote. Mick proved to be the most popular, with nearly 50% of the vote.&lt;ref name="Vote Favourite Carter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a541266/eastenders-which-of-the-new-carters-is-your-favourite-poll.html#~oOyePbE1BlVvh1|title='EastEnders': Which of the new Carters is your favourite? - poll|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=3 January 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early storylines===

Linda's early stories included her struggle with son [[Johnny Carter (EastEnders)|Johnny]]'s ([[Sam Strike]]) [[sexuality]], which was revealed a week after the Carters moved into the Vic. While Mick portrayed the accepting father (a portrayal that was widely praised by critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atvtoday.co.uk/49796-eastenders-bosses-deny-dyer-dressing-down-report-27890/|title=EastEnders: Bosses deny Dyer ‘dressing down’ report|last=Linden|first=Shaun|date=5 January 2014|work=ATV Today|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Linda protested against her son being gay, and encouraged him to enter a relationship with his friend, [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), who was obviously keen. This caused many arguments between mother and son.&lt;ref name="Linda pushes Johnny for Whitney"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/scoop/a546591/corrie-reveal-eastenders-johnny-row-emmerdale-deal-hollyoaks-fire.html#~oOyg9uuNZroC3X|title=Corrie reveal, EastEnders Johnny row, Emmerdale deal, Hollyoaks fire|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=26 January 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument eventually reached breaking point in June 2014, when Linda failed to support Johnny's plans to go to gay pride and caused him embarrassment by revealing his cowardice during the attack on [[Sharon Rickman]] ([[Letitia Dean]]).&lt;ref name="Johnny leaves home"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a578045/eastenders-johnny-carter-leaves-walford-after-showdown-with-linda.html#~oOygN5pSyqKI8k|title=EastEnders: Johnny Carter leaves Walford after showdown with Linda|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|date=17 June 2013|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Johnny left home, but Linda tracked him down with the help of her father-in-law [[Stan Carter|Stan]] ([[Timothy West]]), and they reunited, with Linda showing her acceptance by dropping him off at [[Gay pride parade|gay pride]] in London.

Other storylines included Linda's turmoilous friendship with Sharon Rickman, which turned into a rivalry when she opened a rival bar, 'The Albert' in Walford; her plans to breed her dog, Lady Di, being scuppered when her daughter [[Nancy Carter|Nancy]] ([[Maddy Hill]]) lost control of her and she was impregnated by [[Abi Branning]]'s ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) dog [[Tramp (EastEnders)|Tramp]]; and her turmoil over her eldest son, [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee]] (Danny-Boy Hanchard) being in the army, and her supporting him through the grief for a lost comrade on his return to England. She was involved in a brief scandal where [[Dexter Hartman]] (Khali Best), [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]) and [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) discovered pictures of her during her time as a [[Page 3|Page 3 model]].

===Relationship with Mick Carter===

===Dean Wicks and rape===
In April 2014, [[Matt Di Angelo]] was reintroduced as Shirley Carter's estranged son [[Dean Wicks]]. Linda formed a connection with Dean as she counselled him through his long standing issues with his mother, having a fair perspective on the situation due to her own battles with Shirley in the past. Through this, Dean developed feelings for her.&lt;ref name="Dean develops feelings for Linda"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a576781/dean-develops-feelings-for-linda.html#~oOypvoGoXl5haB|title=Dean develops feelings for Linda|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=24 June 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda remained unaware of the crush for several weeks until Dean fondled her buttocks during a photoshoot for the salon. Linda warned him to back off.&lt;ref name="Dean pinches Linda's bum"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a581532/eastenders-dean-wickss-behaviour-to-shock-linda-carter.html#~oOyqYNa19bP7nm|title=EastEnders: Dean Wicks's behaviour to shock Linda Carter|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=1 July 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of Dean's feelings for Linda, Di Angelo claimed that it stemmed from the desire that 'Dean (secretly) wants to be Mick', but warned that it wouldn't 'be filled with too much happiness for too long'.&lt;ref name="Dean pinches Linda's bum" /&gt; Dean also stumbled upon the family secret that Mick and Linda were not married, and later drunkenly kissed Linda when she was struggling with issues surrounding Mick falsely pleading guilty to [[soliciting]] [[prostitutes]].&lt;ref name="Dean kisses Linda"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a588402/eastenders-dean-wicks-kisses-linda-carter-spoiler-pictures.html#~oOysRfTiyxMkWE|title=EastEnders: Dean Wicks kisses Linda Carter - spoiler pictures|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=5 August 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2014, it was announced that Dean would rape Linda. ''EastEnders'' bosses worked with charity Rape Crisis to develop the storyline.

The storyline aired over the autumn.&lt;ref name="Linda rape storyline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a593588/eastenders-to-feature-linda-carter-rape-storyline.html#~oOytfn9hhZ38FN|title=EastEnders to feature Linda Carter rape storyline|last=Harp|first=Justin|date=31 August 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maria Friedman]] was introduced as Linda's mother, [[Elaine Peacock]].

The show's debut was on November 28, 1999, and aired on [[CBS]] as part of ''[[Nick Jr. on CBS]]'', from September 16, 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shrivastava|first1=K M|title=Broadcast Journalism in the 21st Century|date=2005|publisher=New Dawn Press Group|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tpt8knkqUsoC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=%22Nick+Jr+on+CBS%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9VbnVK3INIHAgwSPx4GgAw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nick%20Jr%20on%20CBS%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=February 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; – September 7, 2002, then as part of ''[[Nick on CBS]]'' from August 2, 2003 – September 10, 2005. The final episode aired on February 6, 2004, and reruns returned, with the return of ''Nick Jr. on CBS'', on September 17, 2005. 

Reruns continued to air on the [[Nick Jr.]] channel until February 24, 2014.

''Little Bill'' was seen through until September 9, 2006, when the block was replaced with the ''[[KOL Secret Slumber Party]]'' block (which became: ''[[Cookie Jar TV]]''). [[Sonia Manzano]], best known for playing [[Human characters on Sesame Street|Maria Rodriguez]] on ''[[Sesame Street]]'', was a frequent writer for the show.

==Synopsis==
Set in [[Philadelphia]], the show centers on Little Bill Glover as he explores everyday life through his imagination. Little Bill lives with his parents, his great grandmother Alice (aka Alice the Great), his older sister April and brother Bobby. At the end of every show, he [[Meta-reference|breaks the fourth wall]] by summarizing his day to the audience before going to bed.

Sometimes, he even talks to his pet hamster, Elephant. Then, one of his family members says, "Little Bill, who are you talking to?". This was an ongoing catchphrase that closed every show.

Most episodes contain two eleven minute stories, except for three episodes. There were two episodes focusing on Little Bill's idol, Captain Brainstorm, and a special for Christmas (''Merry Christmas Little Bill''). Although he only performs the very minor role of Captain Brainstorm, Bill Cosby appears in live action during the opening credits of the series, interacting with the animated character of Little Bill.

== Characters ==
;William "Bill/Little Bill" Glover Jr.: An inquisitive and imaginative boy who loves his pet hamster named Elephant, and is a fan of the fictional Blue Socks baseball team. He also likes Captain Brainstorm because he comes up with great ideas. He enjoys going to [[kindergarten]], although he misses Elephant, but he is still happy and content nonetheless. He is known as Little Bill because his actual name is Bill Jr; his father's name is also Bill. Little Bill is based on Bill Cosby's son, [[Murder of Ennis Cosby|Ennis William Cosby]], and was voiced by Xavier Pritchett.
;William "Bill/Big Bill" Glover Sr.: Little Bill, Bobby, and April's father, and is the husband of Brenda. They have a very close relationship with their father. He works for the Department of Housing, as a housing inspector. His hobby is collecting and listening to jazz records. He is also known as Big Bill because his actual name is Bill Sr. He was voiced by [[Gregory Hines]].
;Brenda Glover (née Kendall): Little Bill, Bobby, and April's mother, and is the wife of Big Bill. She works for a bank (seen in "Mom's Trip"), but her hobby is photography. She was voiced by [[Phylicia Rashad]].
;April Glover: The oldest and only daughter of the Glover children. She is a highly talented basketball player on the school team, and also at basketball camp, where she won a trophy and is also in a choir at the family's local church. She is often seen getting bossy and she sometimes argues with Bobby. She was voiced by Monique Beasley.
;Robert "Bobby" Glover: Bobby is the most studious of the kids. He is always reading and investigating things. He is the middle child, and oldest son of the Glover children. He can also play the violin, and sometimes he can say upsetting things, usually resulting in his family saying, "Bobby!". He was voiced by Devon Malik Beckford (Season 1–2), and then [[Tyler James Williams]] (Season 3–4).
;Alice the Great: Great-grandmother of Little Bill, Bobby, April, and Jamal; Alice is also Brenda and Deborah's grandmother (see "The Magic Quilt").

He was voiced by [[Muhammad Cunningham]].
;Miss Aisha Murray–Clinkscales: Little Bill's kindergarten teacher, who later marries Dr. Winthrop Clinkscales (although the students are still allowed to call her Miss Murray, since they have trouble pronouncing her husband's surname). Their engagement was mentioned in "The Ring Bear" and they were married in "Miss Murray's Wedding." She was voiced by [[Ayo Haynes]] and later [[Melanie Nicholls-King]].
;Dr. Winthrop Clinkscales: Mrs. Murray's new husband. He is a doctor, and treats Little Bill when he breaks his arm in "A Trip to the Hospital." The kids usually have difficulty pronouncing his last name.

The '''Madre della Consolazione''' (Crete) is an icon depicting the [[Virgin Mary]] holding baby [[Christ]]. It is believed to have originated during the mid-fifteenth century by [[Nikolaos Tzafouris]].

==Iconography==
The iconography of the Madre della Consolazione type is of Western origin.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OvCiDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA483&amp;ots=4jncWiQyI6&amp;dq=Madre%20della%20Consolazione%20(Crete)%20%2B%20Nikolaos%20Tzafouris&amp;pg=PA483#v=onepage&amp;q=Madre%20della%20Consolazione%20(Crete)%20+%20Nikolaos%20Tzafouris&amp;f=false|title=Byzantium: Faith and Power (1261-1557)|last=[[Helen C. Evans|Evans]] |first=Helen C.|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.)|page=483|date=March 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has clearly been influenced by Italian prototypes from the 14th century. The icon’s Italian title refers to the suffering of Christ, as anticipated by his mother. The type was probably introduced to the Orthodox-Christian world by the famous icon painter Nikolaos Tzafouris in the second half of the 15th century; his oeuvre is typified by combined Byzantine and Italian iconographical types. Our icon is painted in a highly refined style and can be dated in the late 15th century.

==Attribution==
Very similar floral punched motifs can be found in the halos of the signed Tzafouris [[Pieta]] icon in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in Vienna and in the halos of the signed Tzafouris Madre della Consolazione icon in a Dutch private collection (currently on loan to the [[Ikonen-Museum Recklinghausen]], Germany). The punching, the specific iconography and the refined style of the painting, all point towards [[Nikolaos Tzafouris]] or a painter from his immediate circle.

==Location==
The icon was in the collection of [[Morsink Icon Gallery]], [[Amsterdam]] till 2016 and then was purchased by a private collector from the [[Netherlands]].

'''Makoto Fujimura''' (born 1960) is a 21st-century artist. He graduated with a B.A. from [[Bucknell University]], then studied in a traditional [[Japanese painting]] doctorate program for several years at [[Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]] with several notable artists such as [[Takashi Murakami]] and [[Hiroshi Senju]]. He was the first non-native to participate in the Japanese Painting Doctorate Program, which dates back to 15th century. His bicultural arts education led his style towards a fusion between fine art and abstract [[expressionism]], together with the traditional Japanese art of [[Nihonga]] and Kacho-ga ([[bird-and-flower painting]] tradition).

==Work==
On September 1, 2015, Fujimura was appointed Director of the [http://www.brehmcenter.com/  Brehm Center for Worship, Theology, and the Arts] at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]]. In this role, he will be a “vision director” for Fuller’s Brehm Center, leading and teaching from his studio space in order to foster a robust, imaginative experience for students. Fujimura hopes to be a catalyst for innovation in the future of seminary education, integrating the best of the arts into the church, seeing cities as classrooms for that integration, and helping the church to become the leading practitioner of culture care. Fujimura understands "culture care" as giving import to the creation and conservation of beauty as an antidote to cultural brokenness by asserting a need for cultural “generativity” in public life. (See his [https://vimeo.com/129589009 speech] on culture care at the National Press Club.) Fujimura’s book ''[http://www.ivpress.com/cgi-ivpress/book.pl/code=4503]'' is a support volume to the personal gatherings and international speaking engagements in which he shares that vision with like-minded artists, supporters, and creatives.
 
Fujimura founded the [[International Arts Movement]] in 1991. He has co-hosted several major conferences for the International Arts Movement, and continues to develop the gathering through Culture Care Summit (Feb 8-12th, 2017 at Fuller).  In 2011 the [http://www.fujimurainstitute.org Fujimura Institute] was established and launched the Qu4rtets, a collaboration between Fujimura, painter Bruce Herman, Duke theologian/pianist [[Jeremy Begbie]], and Yale composer [[Christopher Theofanidis]], based on T.S. Eliot’s Four Quartets. The exhibition travelled to Baylor University, Duke University, and Yale University, Hong Kong University, Cambridge University, Gordon College, Roanoke College and other institutions around the globe. Qu4rtets became the first contemporary art exhibited at the historic King's Chapel in Cambridge, UK, for the Easter of 2015, and was exhibited in Hiroshima for the 70th anniversary of the atomic bombings in November 2015.

He is represented by Artrue International and exhibits regularly in Waterfall Mansion Gallery in New York City and other galleries internationally. His works are in permanent collection at the National Modern Museum of Art in Tokyo, Yokohama Museum of Art, Tokyo University of the Arts Museum, the Saint Louis Museum, the Cincinnati Museum, and the CNN building in Hong Kong, and other museums globally. Tikotin Museum in Israel will host a solo exhibit in 2018 curated by [https://hammer.ucla.edu/nc/blog/?tx_hammer_blog%5Bcategory%5D=34&amp;tx_hammer_blog%5Bcontroller%5D=Blog&amp;cHash=8cb19fef24260cc8c4c713783ca8e0c8 James Elaine].

He was appointed by President Bush to the National Council on the Arts in 2003. At the completion of his term in 2009, then Chair Dana Gioia awarded him the Chairman's Medal for his service and contribution to arts advocacy in the United States.

His work includes “The Splendor of the Medium”, "Water Flames," and "Charis," and "Golden Sea," a collection of paintings using stone-ground minerals including gold, platinum, [[azurite]], [[malachite]] and [[cinnabar]]. He has collaborated with percussionist/composer Susie Ibarra on multiple occasions, and his live painting was recorded by Plywood Pictures in "Live in New York: Susie Ibarra + Makoto Fujimura." (2009)

In November 2009, Fujimura's works were coupled with works of [[Georges Rouault]] at Dillon Gallery. Fujimura created several new works in homage to the 20th century master, the catalyst of the "Sacred Arts Movement" in Paris that influenced Picasso, Matisse and other modernist artists. Fujimura wrote an essay for the show that was included in a short book that was produced to accompany the show called "Soliloquies"  (Square Halo Books, 2009).

Crossway Publishing commissioned Fujimura in 2009 for The Four Holy Gospels project to commemorate the 400th Anniversary of the publishing of the [[King James Bible]].  It was the first time that a single artist has been commissioned to [[illuminated manuscript|illuminate]] the four Gospels in nearly five hundred years. The Gospels were on exhibition at the [http://www.mobia.org/ Museum Of Biblical Art] in Manhattan in 2011, and are on display in [[Takashimaya]], [[Nihonbashi]], Tokyo, until December, 2011. The Four Holy Gospels consist of five major frontispieces, 89 chapter heading letters and over 140 pages of hand illumined pages, all done in traditional [[Nihonga]].  The Four Holy Gospels original art will be featured in "Four Holy Gospels Chapel" at [https://www.museumofthebible.org/ the Museum of the Bible] in Washington D.C..

The '''Marcha de las Malvinas''' (in English: ''March of the Malvinas'') is a patriotic anthem of [[Argentina]]. It is sung in demonstrations to assert Argentina sovereignty claims over the [[Falkland Islands]] (in Spanish: Islas Malvinas) and was prominently broadcast by the [[Proceso de Reorganización Nacional|military government]] (controlled media during the [[Falklands War]]).

On March 3, 1948, it was premiered by the [[Argentine National Symphony Orchestra]].

The lyrics were written by the Argentine poet [[Carlos Obligado]] and the music was composed by [[José Tieri]]. They won a 1939 contest organised by the ''Junta de Recuperación de las Malvinas'' (''Malvinas Recovery Commission'').

Tras su manto de neblinas&lt;br /&gt;
No las hemos de olvidar&lt;br /&gt;
Las Malvinas Argentinas&lt;br /&gt;
Clama el viento y ruge el mar&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ni de aquellos horizontes&lt;br /&gt;
Nuestra enseña han de arrancar&lt;br /&gt;
Pues su blanco está en los montes&lt;br /&gt;
Y en su azul se tiñe el mar&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Por ausente, por vencido&lt;br /&gt;
Bajo extraño pabellón&lt;br /&gt;
Ningún suelo más querido&lt;br /&gt;
De la Patria en la extensión&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
¿Quién nos habla aquí de olvido&lt;br /&gt;
De renuncia, de perdón?&lt;br /&gt;
Ningún suelo más querido&lt;br /&gt;
De la Patria en la extensión&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rompa el manto de neblinas&lt;br /&gt;
Como un sol, nuestro ideal&lt;br /&gt;
Las Malvinas Argentinas&lt;br /&gt;
En dominio ya inmortal&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Y ante el sol de nuestro emblema&lt;br /&gt;
Pura, nítida y triunfal&lt;br /&gt;
Brille "¡Oh, Patria!" en tu diadema&lt;br /&gt;
La perdida perla austral&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Para honor de nuestro emblema&lt;br /&gt;
Para orgullo nacional&lt;br /&gt;
Brille "¡Oh, Patria!" en tu diadema&lt;br /&gt;

Brille "¡Oh, Patria!" en tu diadema&lt;br /&gt;

Behind their misty quilt&lt;br /&gt;
We won't forget them.&lt;br /&gt;
"The Argentine Malvinas!"&lt;br /&gt;
The wind cries out and the sea roars&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nor from those horizons&lt;br /&gt;
Will our ensign be ripped&lt;br /&gt;
As its white is on the hills&lt;br /&gt;
And the sea is tinted in its blue&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For absent, for defeated&lt;br /&gt;
Under a strange flag&lt;br /&gt;
No land is more wanted&lt;br /&gt;
Of the Fatherland as a whole&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who's talking to us here of neglect&lt;br /&gt;
Of renouncement, of forgiveness?&lt;br /&gt;
For no land is more wanted&lt;br /&gt;
Of the Fatherland as a whole!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Break off the misty quilt&lt;br /&gt;
As a sun, our ideal&lt;br /&gt;
The Argentinian Malvinas&lt;br /&gt;
Under an already immortal dominion,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And facing the sun of our emblem&lt;br /&gt;
Pure, distinct, and victorious&lt;br /&gt;
It shines, "Oh, Fatherland!" in your diadem&lt;br /&gt;
The lost Southern pearl.&lt;br /&gt;

For honor to our emblem,&lt;br /&gt;

'''María Padín''' (1888–1970) was a [[Uruguay]]an film, radio, and theater actress and producer who had a successful career in [[Argentina]].

==Career==
The daughter of circus actors {{ill|Manuel Padín|es}} (the clown ''Padín el 77'') and Eulalia Mendizábal (trapeze artist), María Padín had a sister from this marriage named Aída Padín, who would later marry Francisco Aniceto Benavente and give her a nephew, [[Saulo Benavente]], a painter, illuminator, and scenographer. After her parents separated, Manuel Padín married the Uruguayan actress Máxima Hourquet, giving María seven half-siblings (one of whom died a young child), including the first comic actress and vedette [[Margarita Padín]], and the young figures {{ill|Pilar Padín|es}} and {{ill|Fausto Padín|es}}. Her sister-in-law was the actress Raquel Oquendo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHLd-uTUL9gC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA45 |title=Diccionario de directores y escenógrafos del teatro argentino |trans-title=Dictionary of Directors and Scenographers of Argentine Theater |last=Zayas de Lima |first=Perla |publisher=Editorial Galerna |isbn=9789505562503 |page=45 |language=Spanish |year=1990 |access-date=20 December 2017 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

María started working as a professional actress in 1905 with the {{ill|Podestá Brothers|es|Hermanos Podestá}}, and later also worked in radio and television. In radio, she was the first actress of the Radio-Teatrales Argentinas companies of Ricardo Migueres and Ricardo Bustamante.

Her appearance in cinema occurred very early, starring alongside leading figures of the [[Golden Age of Argentine Cinema|golden age of Argentine cinema]], including {{ill|Orfilia Rico|es}}, [[Azucena Maizani]], [[Floren Delbene]], {{ill|Carlos Dux|es}}, {{ill|Julio Scarcella|es}}, {{ill|Celestino Petray|es}}, [[Santiago Arrieta]], [[Homero Cárpena]], [[Pedro Aleandro]], {{ill|Ilde Pirovano|es}}, and [[Domingo Sapelli]]. In [[Chile]] she acted in several historical [[silent film]]s with her husband Arturo Mario as director.&lt;ref name=Rist&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrOMAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;ots=Uo6at-Tzks&amp;pg=PA142 |title=Historical Dictionary of South American Cinema |chapter=Chile |last=Rist |first=Peter H. |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |isbn=9780810880368 |page=142 |date=8 May 2014 |access-date=20 December 2017 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cine argentino: La otra historia |trans-title=Argentine Cinema: The Other Story |last=Wolf |first=Sergio |publisher=Letra Buena |isbn=9789507770487 |location=Buenos Aires |page=14 |language=Spanish |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her career on the big screen, Padín had several roles in theatrical [[revue]]s. She worked for [[Pablo Podestá]]'s company, directed by {{ill|Jose Podestá|es|lt=Pepe Podestá}} and with {{ill|Blanca Podestá|es}} and {{ill|Alberto Ballerini|es}}. After this dissolved, she settled for a few years in Chile and returned to form her own comedy company with advice from Dr. Oscar R. Beltrán. Then she joined her husband's company, called "Mario", which was made up of the actors {{ill|Herminia Mancini|es}}, Ángeles Arguelles, Rosa Martínez, Julio Scarcella, and {{ill|Pepito Petray|es}}. With this company she toured locations such as [[Valparaíso]], [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], and [[Lima]].

In 1946 she joined the list of The Democratic Actors Grouping, during the government of [[Juan Perón]], whose board of directors was composed of {{ill|Pablo Racioppi|es}}, [[Lydia Lamaison]], {{ill|Pascual Nacaratti|es}}, [[Alberto Barcel]], and {{ill|Domingo Mania|es}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TprN_mdJc2EC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PT87 |title=Quiera el pueblo votar: imágenes de un siglo de campañas políticas |trans-title=The People Want to Vote: Images of a Century of Political Campaigns |last1=López |first1=Marcela |last2=Kogan |first2=Gabriela |publisher=Editorial Del Nuevo Extremo |isbn=9789876090568 |page=87 |language=Spanish |year=2007 |access-date=20 December 2017 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a great friend of the actress Herminia Mancini, sister of Julia Mancini, with whom she worked in theater.

'''McIntosh &amp; Otis''' is a literary agency based in [[New York City]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_0BVAvJFThUC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;dq=%22ina+Winick%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OJ965SER-5&amp;sig=39Bd5fMTOnjcB0JAjt-Fq2lpR10&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nm5FVcCFIoWqswGZ0oCoAg&amp;redir_esc=y | title = 2012 Guide to Literary Agents | editor = Chuck Sambuchino |location= |publisher= F+W Media, Inc. |page= 225 |date= Aug 9, 2011 |isbn= 9781599632438 |access-date= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was incorporated in 1928 by Mavis McIntosh and Elizabeth Otis. The agency handles literary estates and subsidiary rights for the authors that it represents.

==History==
Mavis McIntosh (1906-1986) and Elizabeth Otis founded McIntosh &amp; Otis in the mid 1920s, after they quit the literary agency at which they were working because they were dissatisfied with its practices. In 1928, they incorporated the firm, and by the early 1930s, it was a reputable and successful literary agency.&lt;ref name="steinbeck_encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book | url= https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=NikZBtGvy_gC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;dq=mcintosh+and+otis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oDAwgxjZNl&amp;sig=vWelR8C5j02BPJG5Lk_5p33oB8Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_GxTU_6pDYqI8AHslICIAw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBzgK | editor = Brian E. Railsback, Michael J. Meyer | title= A John Steinbeck Encyclopedia | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, McIntosh &amp; Otis merged with New-York based agency Constance Smith Associates. [[Patricia Schartle Myrer]], who was a partner at Constance Smith Associates, became President of McIntosh &amp; Otis.&lt;ref name="harper-lee-vf-2013-08"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/08/harper-lee-dispute-royalties | title= To Steal a Mockingbird? | author= Mark Seal | date = August 2013 | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, McIntosh &amp; Otis hired Eugene Winick, a copyright attorney, as outside counsel to represent the literary estates of authors represented by McIntosh &amp; Otis, such as [[Mary Higgins Clark]], [[Harper Lee]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Ayn Rand]], and [[Thomas Wolfe]]. In 1984, Patricia Schartle Myrer retired and appointed Eugene Winick as President of McIntosh &amp; Otis.&lt;ref name="harper-lee-vf-2013-08" /&gt;

In 2001, Samuel Pinkus, a literary agent at McIntosh &amp; Otis and Eugene Winick's son-in-law, took over as President of the agency but left in 2004.&lt;ref name="harper-lee-vf-2013-08" /&gt;
 
Elizabeth Winick Rubinstein, Eugene Winick's daughter, is currently the President of McIntosh &amp; Otis.&lt;ref name="elizabeth-winick-rubinstein"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://museandthemarketplace2015.com/2015/03/09/elizabeth-winick-rubinstein/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150405230952/http://museandthemarketplace2015.com/2015/03/09/elizabeth-winick-rubinstein/ | dead-url = yes | archive-date = April 5, 2015 | title = Elizabeth Winick Rubinstein | publisher = The Muse and the Marketplace 2015 | accessdate = April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elizabeth-winick-rubinstein-2"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://wemagazineforwomen.com/meet-woman-in-business-elizabeth-winick-rubinstein/ | title = Meet woman in Business Elizabeth Winick Rubinstein | publisher = WE magazine for women | author = Heidi Richards | date = September 13, 2013 | accessdate= April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Steinbeck ===
In 1931, [[John Steinbeck]] sent McIntosh &amp; Otis a number of his early manuscripts based on the recommendation of [[Carl Wilhelmson]]. McIntosh &amp; Otis gave Steinbeck positive encouragement, and he stuck with the firm as his only literary agency for the rest of his career, spanning nearly 40 years.&lt;ref name="steinbeck_encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="utexas"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/contribute/advisory/bios/elizabeth_winick_rubinstein.html | title= Bio of Elizabeth Winick Rubinstein | accessdate= April 20, 2014 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141010033601/http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/contribute/advisory/bios/elizabeth_winick_rubinstein.html | archivedate= October 10, 2014 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, McIntosh &amp; Otis sold the film rights of Steinbeck's classic novel ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'' (1952) to [[Warner Brothers]], which adapted it as a [[East of Eden (film)|1955 movie]] starring [[James Dean]]. Steinbeck received $125,000 for the film rights, plus 25 percent of the profits.&lt;ref name="tcm"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/16719/East-of-Eden/articles.html| title= East of Eden (1955), Turner Classic Movies | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Steinbeck won the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature, he gave McIntosh &amp; Otis a percentage of the award money out of gratitude for their support.&lt;ref name="harper-lee-vf-2013-08" /&gt;

In 2004, McIntosh &amp; Otis sold the film rights of Steinbeck's classic novel ''East of Eden'' to [[Universal Pictures]], after the book was chosen for [[Oprah's Book Club]] list. The option expired, and Universal had to once again obtain the film rights.&lt;ref name="hollywood_rep"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gary-ross-write-new-jennifer-682868 | title= Gary Ross to Write New Jennifer Lawrence 'East of Eden' Adaptation | author= Borys Kit  | publisher = Hollywood Reporter | date= Feb 24, 2014 | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A forthcoming two-film series, starring [[Jennifer Lawrence]], was scheduled for production as of April 2014.&lt;ref name="movies"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mcintoshandotis.com/recentnews.html | title= Recent News at McIntosh &amp; Otis | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-jennifer-lawrence-east-of-eden-20130926,0,2873688.story | title=Jennifer Lawrence to play 'East of Eden's' 'psychotic monster' | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=September 26, 2013 | accessdate=February 5, 2014 | author=Keegan, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jennifer Lawrence's 'East of Eden' May Be Two Movies, Says Director (Exclusive Video)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jennifer-lawrences-east-eden-may-695666|accessdate=14 April 2014|newspaper=hollywoodreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patricia Highsmith ===
[[Patricia Highsmith]] appointed Patricia Schartle Myrer as her literary agent in 1959, when Myrer was with Constance Smith Associates. After Constance Smith Associates merged with McIntosh &amp; Otis in 1963, Myrer continued as Patricia Highsmith's American literary agent. A. M. Heath served as Patricia Highsmith's British agents. Over time, Patricia Highsmith came to resent the 5% commission each literary agency took, and Myrer fired Highsmith in 1979.&lt;ref name="patricia-highsmith"&gt;{{cite news | title = Murder, She Wrote |  author = Kera Bolonik | publisher = The Nation | date = November 20, 2003 | url = http://www.thenation.com/article/murder-she-wrote?page=full | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In June 2013, McIntosh &amp; Otis filed a lawsuit against a literary agent formerly employed with them, Samuel Pinkus, in relation with another lawsuit that was filed against him by author [[Harper Lee]], who claimed that Pinkus had duped her into handing over her copyright for her novel ''[[To Kill A Mockingbird]]''.&lt;ref name="harper-lee-vf-2013-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="harper_lee"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.law360.com/articles/470604/harper-lee-settles-with-agent-over-mockingbird-copyright | title= Harper Lee Settles With Agent Over 'Mockingbird' Copyright | author= Pete Brush | publisher = Law360 | date= September 6, 2013 | accessdate= April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harper_lee-2"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/12/harper-lee-lawsuit/2646765/ | title= 'Mockingbird' author stars in her own courtroom classic | author= Cara Matthews | work =  The (Westchester County, N.Y.)

'''Mindy Alper''' (born 1959) is an American artist who lives in [[Greater Los Angeles]]. Her drawings, paintings, and sculptures focus on the [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of people, either in portraiture or as figures who embody aspects of her inner experience. She has been praised for her ability to articulate complex and profound emotion in her work. Among her [[art media]] are paint (oil and acrylic), ink, [[marker pen]], [[papier-mâché]], clay, and wood. She was a [[performance artist]] in the 1980s, and she plays guitar and violin.

Alper is the subject of the documentary film ''[[Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405]]'' (2016), which won the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject)]] in 2018.

==Early life and education==
Alper was born into a Jewish family in [[Brooklyn]], New York in 1959; she was the second of four children, and the only girl.&lt;ref name="McKenna"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-10-18/entertainment/ca-650_1_mindy-alper/|work=Los Angeles Times |last=McKenna |first=Kristine |authorlink=Kristine McKenna |date=October 18, 1992 |title=Inside the Outsider: Artist Mindy Alper reveals the dark paths of her mind through the compulsiveness of her imaginative drawings |access-date=March 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishjournal.com/culture/arts/229826/stop-youve-heard-one/ |title=Film Reveals Woman’s Struggles for Her Art |last=Pfefferman |first=Naomi |date=January 17, 2018 |website=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]] |access-date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was age two, her family moved to Los Angeles, where she has lived ever since.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heavenisatrafficjamonthe405.com/bio/ |title=Mindy's Bio |website=HeavenIsATrafficJamOnThe405.com |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Alper had a [[phobia]] of touching others and of being touched, for fear that her touch was poisonous.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=3:11}} By age four or five, she was drawing prolifically, and she found that drawing relieved her anxiety.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=8:34}}

Alper's parents hired [[visual artist]] Dorothy Cannon to tutor her in art.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deadline"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/heaven-is-a-traffic-jam-mindy-alper-frank-stiefel-oscars-academy-awards-documentary-interview-1202212537/ |title=''Heaven Is a Traffic Jam'' Director on Doc Subject Mindy Alper: 'She’s the most human of us humans' |last=Carey |first=Matthew |date=November 20, 2017 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lessons were in Cannon's home: a creatively decorated and inspiring place filled with music. For her students, Cannon read aloud [[nonsense verse]] by [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Edward Lear]].&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt; She worked with a variety of [[Art media|media]], and introduced Alper to [[papier-mâché]] (a medium Alper was still using 50 years later).{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=9:51}} They made a mask together, and Alper continued making masks until she shifted her subject to people and the human form.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;

Alper later attended an [[alternative school]] in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles|Highland Park]]. In 1974, she began to learn puppet-making from marionettist [[Harry Burnett]].&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; Burnett, who was then in his mid-seventies, was spending his winter years teaching such skills to children, the elderly, and the disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/01/obituaries/harry-burnett-master-of-puppetry-dies-at-92.html |title=Harry Burnett, Master of Puppetry, Dies at 92 |author=&lt;!-- no byline --&gt; |date=June 1, 1993 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I made really intricate [[marionette]]s that took me months to finish," Alper recalls. "I wanted to have control over something and I had control of my marionettes—but, oddly enough, I never played with them. I always gave them away shortly after I finished them."&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;

In 1976, Alper enrolled at [[Immaculate Heart College]], a Catholic private college in Los Angeles, but she was distressed by the way the nuns treated her.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; In 1978 she transferred to [[Los Angeles City College]], where she continued her education in art until 1983.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt; In the mid-1980s, when Alper was 27, she suffered a [[mental breakdown]] and lost the ability to speak, write, or think in words.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=21:44}} Eventually she was able to communicate by rearranging pre-printed words. In 1994, faced with crippling depression, Alper opted for [[electroconvulsive therapy]], which left her with some parts of her brain permanently damaged.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=23:53}}

Through all the changes in her life, Alper remained close to her first art teacher, Cannon, until Cannon's death in 1999.&lt;ref name="artnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/mindy-alper/biography |title=Mindy Alper Biography |website=[[Artnet]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorothycannon.com/cannon-bio.htm |title=Dorothy Cannon |last=Hosler |first=Jay |date=May 19, 2014 |orig-year=2007 |website=DorothyCannon.com |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Cannon died, Alper was at her bedside holding her hand.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=10:15}} Some years later, she studied with painter and professor Susanna Maing of [[Occidental College]].&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oxy.edu/faculty/susanna-maing |title=Faculty: Susanna Maing |website=Oxy.edu |publisher=[[Occidental College]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also approached Bolivian-American painter Tom Wudl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/tom-wudl |title=Tom Wudl |website=[[HuffPost]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alper had an upcoming show, and was feeling very anxious about it. She was also afraid that she had lost her creativity. "Tom promised me that we are [[creativity]] itself, and that he could help me find that in myself again," Alper said. Wudl invited her to study under him at no charge.{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=10:48}} Since then, she has worked with Wudl for several years.

Among Alper's [[art media]] are [[Oil paint|oil]] and [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]] paint, papier-mâché, clay, ink, and marker pen. When she eventually tired of papier-mâché, she began to study [[wood carving]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://www.documentary.org/online-feature/portrait-artist-heaven-traffic-jam-405 |title=A Portrait of an Artist: ''Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405'' |last=Stiefel |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Stiefel |interviewer=Akiva Gottlieb |date=February 26, 2018 |website=Documentary.org |publisher=International Documentary Association |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She plays guitar and violin, and reports that all of her family members were musical. Her mother, she says, also aspired to be a painter, but hid her paintings from her children.&lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;

==Career==
===Teaching===
Alper taught alongside her mentor, Cannon, off and on from 1976 to 1995.&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosamundfelsen.com/attachment/en/56732acf6aa72cc67a11a515/TextTwoColumnsWithFile/56a2c7307bc1386353e1d7b1 |format=[[DOCX]] |title=Mindy Alper |year=2018 |publisher=[[Rosamund Felsen Gallery]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s she was a [[teaching assistant]] at Area H Alternative School, one of the first [[alternative school]]s in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=First Alternative in L.A. Gets Final OK of Board |date=September 1, 1972 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.classmates.com/places/school/Area-H-Alternative-High-School/19933 |via=[[Classmates.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 she taught art on a voluntary basis to [[terminally ill]] teenagers at [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt;

It was around this time that she met Marc Sirinsky, who was directing a theatre group called Imagination Workshop. His wife, [[Catherine Coulson]] (the "[[Log Lady]]" of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' fame), became one of her students, and also a good friend. "I got to know Mindy… when I came to have her help me draw a log, and we really connected," Coulson explains.&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt; During a period in 1992 when Alper lost the power of speech, Coulson acted as an intermediary to help her answer questions for an interview with [[Kristine McKenna]]. At the time of the interview, Sirinsky was working on a play intended to adapt Alper's drawings for the stage.&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;

Susan Arnold, a [[film producer]] and [[casting director]], also met Alper through the Workshop. When she was producing ''[[Benny &amp; Joon]]'' (1993), she arranged for Alper to help [[Mary Stuart Masterson]] prepare for her role as a mentally ill young woman who falls in love with a [[mime artist]].&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/article/1993/04/23/benny-joon/ |title=''Benny &amp; Joon'' |first=Owen |last=Gleiberman |date=April 23, 1993 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alper ceased giving private instruction in 2001. In 2006, she was a visiting artist at the [[California Institute of the Arts]], for the benefit of an experimental drawing class there.&lt;ref name="RFG-bio"/&gt;

===Exhibitions===
From 1982 to 1989, Alper was active in the theatre: first as a member of a [[performance art]] and comedy group called the Love Machine, and then with the Buttersticks, a performance art troupe that she co-founded.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; In 1984, her papier-mâché work was featured in the journal ''Fiberarts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=Fiberarts |date=July 1984 |last=Saito |first=Shirley |title=Mindy Alper: Sculpting in Papier-Mâché |pages=18–19 |volume=11 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has exhibited her paintings and sculpture in several community venues around Los Angeles. After an exhibition at Random Gallery of [[Highland Park, Los Angeles|Highland Park]] in 1988, she returned for a [[Solo show (art exhibition)|solo show]] in 1994, called "Drawing on the Wrong Side of the Brain", followed by a few group shows in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; Among her other solo shows are Raddack Gallery in 1987, and Sincere Technologies Gallery of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt; [[Rosamund Felsen Gallery]] of Los Angeles, which has represented her since 2006, hosted shows for her in 2006, 2007, and 2013.&lt;ref name="artnet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/5-things-to-know-about-the-amazing-outsider-art-doc-that-just-won-an-oscar-1236194 |title=5 Things to Know About the Inspiring Outsider Art Documentary That Just Won an Oscar |last=Rea |first=Naomi |date=March 5, 2018 |website=Artnet News |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Alper's work is [[Representation (arts)|representational]]. While she sometimes paints or sculpts portraits, much of her output comprises [[Line art|line drawing]]s and paintings that are expressive of her emotional state, or which evidence the workings of [[the unconscious]]. Her figures are human (or [[humanoid]]), and sometimes [[anthropomorphic]]. Cannon recalled that, as a child, Alper had "an unusual capacity for dipping into her subconscious and doing drawings from that point of view"; she described Alper's memory as "photographic". Journalist and [[art curator]] [[Kristine McKenna]] esteemed Alper's work from early childhood as "remarkably sophisticated in their technical polish and psychological complexity".&lt;ref name="McKenna" /&gt; Writing in 2018, film critic [[Richard Brody]] was impressed by Alper's ability to capture powerful emotion and potent memories with such precision and sincerity. He found her portraits to be "brilliant [and] moving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/two-standouts-among-the-2018-oscar-nominated-documentary-shorts |title=Two Standouts Among the 2018 Oscar-Nominated Documentary Shorts |last=Brody |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Brody |date=March 3, 2018 |website=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a ten-year period when she lost the power of speech for long stretches, her work changed: "I was very prolific with my drawing," Alper says, "and I think that I was telling more complete stories—maybe because I so desperately was trying to communicate."{{sfn|Stiefel|2016|loc=23:23}}

While studying at Tom Wudl Studio in the 2010s, Alper caught the attention of B. J. Dockweiler, a fellow painter and classmate. Dockweiler was fascinated by Alper's work and disposition. Dockweiler's husband, [[Frank Stiefel]], was equally intrigued when he met Alper at a group show and saw some of her pieces. He talked with Alper occasionally, as they attended some of the same art openings.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;{{cite interview |url=https://nofilmschool.com/2018/03-Commercial%20Exec-Frank-Stiefel-Heaven-Traffic-Jam-405 |title=How a Commercial Exec Became an Oscar-Nominated Director… at 70 |interviewer=Paula Bernstein |last=Stiefel |first=Frank |date=March 1, 2018 |website=No Film School |publisher=NONETWORK |access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asked if he could film her as she worked on one of her newest pieces: a monumental [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of her therapist, Shoshana Gerson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://realscreen.com/2018/03/04/heaven-is-a-traffic-jam-on-the-405-takes-oscar-for-best-documentary-short/ |title=''Heaven is a Traffic Jam on the 405'' takes Oscar for best documentary short |author=&lt;!-- staff --&gt; |date=March 4, 2018 |website=Realscreen |access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few months of filming, Stiefel interviewed Alper on camera; five more interviews followed, and Alper's story emerged.&lt;ref name="Carey"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailynews.com/2018/02/19/valley-artist-featured-in-oscar-nominated-documentary-ponders-a-trip-to-the-academy-awards/ |title=Valley artist featured in Oscar-nominated documentary ponders a trip to the Academy Awards |last=Carey |first=Matthew |date=February 19, 2018 |website=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottlieb"/&gt; The film, ''[[Heaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405]]'', premiered at the [[Austin Film Festival]] in 2016, where it won the Jury Award and the Audience Award in the "Documentary Short" category.

'''Miss Canfield''' is a [[fiction]]al character in the [[United States of America|American]] television [[sitcom]] ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''. Miss Canfield is portrayed by [[Diane Brewster]].

The character appeared in four first season episodes. Brewster then left the series without explanation. Sue Randall stepped in to play Beaver's teacher, Alice Landers, over the following seasons. In “Beaver’s Pigeons”(1959) the two pigeons are named Miss Canfield and Miss Landers

Miss Canfield's portrayer Diane Brewster also appeared in the show's pilot [[It's a Small World (Leave It to Beaver episode)|"It's a Small World"]] as Miss Simms, a secretary at the Franklin Milk Company.

==Overview==
Miss Canfield is a young and attractive, no-nonsense schoolteacher who is leading a second grade class for the first time at Grant Avenue Grammar School when the show debuts in 1957. She has a good relationship with her students and her colleague, Mrs. Rayburn.

In the premiere episode, Miss Canfield sends a note home with Beaver, who believes he is going to be expelled. Beaver is relieved when he discovers that the note contains only a request to have him play Smokey Bear in a school pageant. In another episode, Beaver develops a crush on Miss Canfield, and, at the urging of his classmates, puts a spring snake in her desk to prove he's not a teacher's pet. In "Part-Time Genius", Miss Canfield tells the Cleavers that Beaver's IQ test results indicate he's a genius. It proves to be a false alarm, however. In her last appearance, Miss Canfield discovers a dog hidden inside Beaver's jacket.

Miss Canfield was a warm and attractive character, a patient and understanding teacher. Her first name is never revealed on the show.

[[File:Matisse - Vase of Sunflowers (1898).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henri Matisse]], ''Vase of Sunflowers'', 1898–1899, [[State Hermitage Museum]] [[Saint Petersburg, Russia]].]]

'''Painterliness''' is a concept based on the [[German language|German]] term '''''{{lang|de|malerisch}}''''' (painterly), a word popularized by Swiss [[art historian]] [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945) to help focus, enrich and standardize the terms being used by art historians of his time to characterize [[Work of art|works of art]].  It is the opposite of [[Linear (art)|linear]], plastic or formal linear design.&lt;ref&gt;For further clarification of the meaning of ''malerisch'' read ''Francis Bacon: Logic of Sensation'' by [[Gilles Deleuze]].&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[oil painting]] is painterly when there are visible [[Brush#Paintbrushes|brushstroke]]s, the result of applying paint in a less than completely controlled manner, generally without closely following carefully drawn lines. Works characterized as either painterly or linear can be produced with any painting media: oils, acrylics, watercolors, gouache, etc. Some artists whose work could be characterized as painterly are [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], and [[John Singer Sargent]]. In watercolor it might be represented by the early watercolors of [[Andrew Wyeth]].

In contrast, ''linear'' could describe the painting of artists such as [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], whose works depend on creating the illusion of a degree of [[three-dimensional]]ity by means of "modeling the form" through skillful drawing, shading, and an academic rather than impulsive use of color. Contour and pattern are more in the province of the linear artists, while dynamism is the most common trait of painterly works.

The [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Abstract Expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]] tended strongly to be painterly movements.

Painterly art often makes use of the many visual effects produced by paint on canvas such as chromatic progression, warm and cool tones, [[Color wheel|complementary and contrasting colors]], broken tones, broad brushstrokes, [[Sketch (drawing)|sketchiness]], and [[impasto]].

==Other usage==
Although ''painterly'' generally refers to a certain use of paint in art, it happens that some forms of [[sculpture]] make use of apparently random surface effects which, if not exactly resembling brushstrokes, contain the traits of painterliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wölfflin |first=Heinrich |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pjwhZxy7fYAC&amp;pg=PA54 |title=Principles of Art History |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |page=54 |isbn=9780486141763}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the term ''painterly'' outside of painting may help the viewer or listener experience more deeply the significance of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s surfaces or [[Richard Strauss]]'s flow of chromatic harmonies.

"Painterly" is used to describe computer software, especially mobile apps, designed to create special effects on photographs, mimicking recognizably artistic styles such as oils, watercolors, Japanese woodcuts, etc., or based on styles like van Gogh or Monet, and so on. The resulting photographs are also called "painterly." &lt;ref&gt;{{url=http://iphonephotographyschool.com/painterly-apps/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Domesday zinco Somerset Glastonbury.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A page from the photozincographic edition of Domesday Book for ''[[Somerset|Somersetshire]]'' (published in 1862), showing entries for some of the landholdings of [[Glastonbury Abbey]]]]
In the 1860s the first [[facsimile]] of [[Domesday Book]] was created by the process of [[photozincography]] (later termed ''zinco''), and was executed under the directorship of [[Henry James (Ordnance Survey)|Henry James]] at the [[Southampton]] offices of the [[Ordnance Survey]].

==Initial stages==
Having developed the photozincographic process, in a meeting arranged between James and [[William Ewart Gladstone]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], Sir Henry expressed his ability to produce photozincographic copies of ancient documents at "a very trifling cost".&lt;ref&gt;H. James, ''Domesday Book, or The Great Survey of England of William the Conqueror...Fac-Simile of the Part Relating to Cornwall'', (Southampton: by H.M. Command, 1860), pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; James outlined for his superiors the cost of a complete reproduction of Domesday Book (an estimate of £1575 for 500 copies or £3.3s per copy) using his process. In addition to this James further outlined the cost of a single county to demonstrate the affordability of the process, using Cornwall as an example of one of the shorter entries in the volumes (eleven folio pages) and estimated the cost of 500 copies to be £11. 2s. 4d. In doing so he selected the first extract of Domesday Book that he would photozincograph.

On 24 January 1861, Sir Henry was granted permission to photozincograph the [[Cornwall]] fragment of Domesday as a Treasury funded experiment to determine the success of the process. [[Joseph Burtt]], one of the Assistant Keepers of the Records was directed to assist the Record Office binder, Hood, to unbind the relevant pages from Domesday  and on Monday 4 February 1861 Burtt transported Domesday to Southampton by train.&lt;ref&gt;E. Hallam, ''Domesday Book: Through Nine Centuries'', (London: Guild Publishing, 1986), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domesday Book in Southampton==
[[File:OS Map of Southampton new.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1865 map showing the photography building and the Ordnance Survey offices]]
On arrival at the Ordnance Survey offices in Southampton, Burtt expressed his satisfaction with the buildings' "fireproof principles, and…military guard", and was given use of the best room in the building in which Domesday was placed in a fireproof safe, and the key entrusted to Burtt. Burtt’s description of the preparations extends to the actual photozincographic process, including James’s insistence that all plates should be developed and printed before the folios were returned. Nevertheless, the photozincography of Cornwall was completed in 11 days and Burtt returned to [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;PRO 1/25 16 Feb. 1861&lt;/ref&gt; The process was carried out in the Ordnance Survey photography building nicknamed the glasshouse.

==Permissions and difficulties==
Having completed Cornwall, James requested permission to photozincograph the rest of Domesday. Despite his claim that the public sale of the bound and engraved copies could cover the entire cost of the photozincography of the counties, the Lords of the Treasury wished to consult the [[Master of the Rolls]] regarding the comparison of James’s photozincographic reproductions with a rival process employed by [[Lambert Larking|Rev. Lambert Larking]] of Kent.&lt;ref&gt;E. Hallam, ''Domesday Book: Through Nine Centuries'', (London: Guild Publishing, 1986), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Larking (a local antiquarian) had employed an artist to assist the reproduction of the county of Kent using the lithographic process - a much more expensive means of reproduction than photozincography. However, in order to secure this permission over Larking's process James had to provide the Treasury with evidence of public interest and a guarantee of low-cost production. [[Thomas Letts]] of Letts Son &amp; Co. Limited, London distributed a circular nationally  bearing a foreword from James encouraging subscription, and by late October more than fifty subscribers to each county had been amassed. On 28 November 1861 Burtt returned to Southampton once more with Domesday for the aforementioned counties’ photozincographing, and by December James had secured permission from the Treasury to copy the remainder of Great Domesday – but he was explicitly forbidden from reproducing Kent, in defence of Larking’s lithograph. By 1864 the facsimile of the entirety of Great Domesday had been completed, and had been published in 32 county volumes including Kent following Larking's death, who granted James permission to complete the reproduction of the county due to his infirmity in the final stages of his life.&lt;ref&gt;T. Owen &amp; E. Pilbeam, ''Ordnance Survey: Map Makers to Britain since 1791'', (Southampton: Ordnance Survey; London: H.M.S.O., 1992), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; 

The volumes were published in two colours (red and black), replicating the colours used in the original manuscript.

==Today==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The books which were printed by James's method are still sought after even if they are not up to the standard of later facsimiles. His edition of ''Domesday Book'' is still the only facsimile of it available and can be found reasonably cheaply, whereas the letterpress is extremely rare and very expensive."
&lt;/blockquote&gt; G. Wakeman, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wakeman, ''Aspects of Victorian Lithography'', (Wymondham: Brewhouse Press, 1970), p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Portrayal of female bodies in Chinese contemporary art''' has become a lot more diverse as women artists start to rise in China. Many contemporary Chinese women artists have employed the use of female bodies as the subject of their artworks. From the ancient and imperial period of China until early the 19th century, women's body images in Chinese art were predominantly portrayed through male artists' lenses. As a result, female bodies were often misrepresented. With the arrival of [[modernism]] in Chinese contemporary art, women now have more influences in the field of [[visual arts]]. Chinese women artists employ unconventional artistic expressions in order to speak about their experiences of being a female and an artist in a patriarchal society. Although the Chinese visual art field has been more inclusive in the recent decades, women artists’ representation in major art [[exhibition]]s is still significantly less than male artists. Therefore, artists and curators have made a joint effort to devote certain art exhibitions to just Chinese women artists.

== Historical Context ==
=== Ancient and Imperial Period ===
[[File:Chinese - Landscape with Figures - Walters 35101O.jpg|thumb]]
Traditionally, female bodies were only valued as carriers for the family bloodline. In traditional paintings, nude women were a taboo for the artists. As a result, the portrayal of women's bodies was formulaic, always with slim figures, usually leaning on another object or have a slightly bent posture to further emphasize their delicate bodies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mary|first=Fong|date=Summer 1996|title=Images of Women in Traditional Chinese Painting|jstor=1358525|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=17|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female images would also demonstrate ideal qualities of women at that time. Aside from feminine beauty and charm, she should also possess the virtues of subordinating herself in a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] patriarchal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Nigris|first=Ornella|date=March 2016|title=Traditional imagery of women as seen through female visual art: Hung Liu|url=|journal=International Communication of Chinese Culture|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women in these ancient paintings all wore long silk skirts that came down to the ankles. They could only show the part of their body above their chest. Their appearance, combined with their slender body figures, showed the submissive and demure qualities, which was desirable for male audiences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1970s-1980s ===
A drastic change in ideal femininity occurred in 1966 and 1967 when the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Art of Modern China|last=Andres|first=Julia|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|isbn=9780520238145|location=|pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cultural Revolution, led by [[Mao Zedong]], denounced the traditional image of women's inferiority and calls for a women's liberation in the new China. Propaganda tools, such as performance art, films, and posters, strongly supported this movement and effectively constructed and broadcast a new female identity. Feminine beauty was no longer characterized by delicate figures, but instead by masculinized images of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhuying|date=2015|title=Female Masculinity and the Image of Women in the Chinese Cultural Revolution|url=|journal=The International Academic Forum|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "Iron girls" represented the permissible appearances of women in the 1970s. They should not wear anything that showed their female curves. Moreover, women were encouraged to dress like men and go to work like men did, given that Mao called for a "gender erasure" in order to make "Chinese women in new China."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pei|first=Yuxin|date=2006|title=Iron Girls, Strong Women, Beautiful Women Writers and Super Girls: A Discourse Analysis of the Gender Performance of Women in Contemporary China|url=|journal=Lilith: A Feminist History Journal|volume=15|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to "Iron Girls," "Strong Women" images were popularized through mass media, such as [[cartoon]]s and local newspapers. Their appearance was defined by masculinized traits: tanned skin tone, sturdy figures, and blue and black work uniforms. Feminine features, like smooth skin and hands, were seen as something to be ashamed of because they were expected to be contributing to the nation's economy like men did.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Contemporary Portrayal of Women Bodies ==

=== Installation ===

==== "Trauma" ====
In her installation series, "Trauma", [[Hung Liu]] portrays a bound-foot woman. [[Foot binding]] was practiced among Chinese women from the Song dynasty up until the early 20th century. Women would wrap their feet tightly in order to keep them small, which was characterized as a feminine beauty at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Body|last=Pitts-Taylor|first=Victoria|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2008|isbn=9780313341458|location=|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Liu's installation pieces, she repeatedly shows an emotionless woman with her naked feet. As a result of the foot binding cultural, these women had deformed feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Elaine H.|date=|title="Bad Women": Asian American Visual Artists Hanh Thi Pham, Hung Liu, and Yong Soon Min|jstor=3178131|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=22|pages=589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paintings ===

==== Feng Jiali's Oil Paintings ====
Feng Jiali is famous for her [[oil painting]] of explicit images of [[female]] bodies. A series of her paintings depict young, school-aged [[Chinese people|Chinese]] girls, usually skimpily dressed in the bath or laying in bed. The girls in her paintings almost always look directly at the viewers, some innocent-looking, some with a confrontational gaze.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hwee Leng Teo|first=Phyllis|date=January 2010|title=Alternative Agency in Representation by Contemporary Chinese Women Artists|url=|journal=Asian Culture and History|volume=2|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another series of her works involves photographs of her [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] body. By revealing her own pregnant body fearlessly in front of the camera, she challenges the traditional views of pregnant body as something private and a mean to continue the family line, favoring boys over girls, and following the [[one-child policy]]. Because pregnant [[Nude (art)|nude]] is normally not defined as the ideal beauty found in female bodies, Feng’s photo collage expresses another aspect of being a woman. She desired to express the hardships and anxieties of being pregnant, which contradicts with the conventional, sacred portrayal of childbirth by many male artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/853244969|title=New modern Chinese women and gender politics : the centennial of the end of the Qing Dynasty|last=Chen|first=Ya-chen|publisher=Routledge|others=|year=2014|isbn=9780415841382|location=New York|pages=115|oclc=853244969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Banana Leaves Series" ====
Cai Jin, another contemporary oil painter, also challenges the traditional taboos of nudity in ancient Chinese art history. Unlike Feng Jiali, however, Cai articulates female bodies in a semi-abstract way by using organic elements in her paintings. A series of her paintings depict women's bodies shaped like banana tree leaves. Unlike many conventional portrayals of the female body that serves in the interest of male audiences, Cai painted the bodies like decomposed flesh, which is then metamorphosed into dripping, red, [[Banana leaf|banana leaves]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Traditionally, plants, especially flowers, are associated with femininity. However, Cai made a modern twist on this subject and made it into a somewhat unpleasant-looking and distorted image, rejecting the stereotypical delicate women and flowers association.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Like how Feng declared that pregnant bodies can be art too, Cai had made an assertion that although women's bodies aren't always going to be maintained in a perfect way, they can still become a form of art.

=== Performance Arts ===

==== "Opening of the Great Wall" ====

In ''Opening of the Great Wall'', He Chengyao presented her own naked body in a public space in 2001 and took a series of photographs of herself. The photographs documented her walking confidently with her upper body being nude. She held her bright red bra on her right hand and tied her sweater around the waist. She had a deadpan expression on her face and a confident posture as she walks toward the camera. The photo was taken on the [[Great Wall of China]], which is one of the most popular scenic spots in [[Beijing]], China.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Negotiating Difference : Chinese Contemporary Art in the Global Context|last=Birgit|first=Hopfener|publisher=Verlag und Datenbank fur Geisteswissenschaften|year=2012|isbn=9783897397170|location=Weimar, Germany|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:"Your Body" by Xiang Jing at The Saatchi Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|''Your Body'' (2005, fiberglass &amp; paint, 270×160×150cm) at The Saatchi Gallery, The Revolution Continues: New Art from China, 2008]]
Despite the fact that she was surrounded by many curious tourists, He still maintained a confident look. She had also spontaneously joined in an [[Installation art|installation]] by a male artist, [[HA Schult|H.A. Schult]], which was exhibited on the Great Wall at the same time. Whether intended or not, she had made her appearance as a Chinese women artist in the mainstream of male art production. Furthermore, although her piece took place in 2001, women's nudity in public spaces was still considered taboo at the time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Czechónska|first=Magdalena|date=2012|title=Body Linguistic Visibility and Retrieved Bodies of the 20th and 21st Century in Chinese Women's Literature and Art|url=|journal=The Central European Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities|volume=25|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Broadcast Exercise" ====

He Chengyao completed this [[performance art]] piece in 2004 at the Shanghai Doland Museum of Modern Art, which combined the themes of body and identity. As the title of the piece suggested, He Chengyao performed a series of exercises in front of a large group of audiences, while her naked body was tightly wrapped with tape.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Her movement caused the tape to be ripped apart one by one. She also wrapped her self with the sticky side of the tape out, which made her body parts stuck together and making it increasingly harder to perform the exercise.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Sculpture ===

==== "Your Body" ====
[[Xiang Jing (artist)|Xiang Jing]] is a Beijing-based sculptor. She is best known for her depiction of realistic nude women sculptures. One of her sculptures, "Your Body", portrays a nude and bald woman slumping in a chair with her legs spread open. There's a prominent scar on the right side of her abdomen. She has sagging breasts, belly fat rolls, and blank expression on her face. None of these qualities fall under the expectation of the ideal female body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xhingyu|date=October 2009|title=Xiang Jing: Shanghai Art Museum|url=|journal=Sculpture|volume=28|pages=78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representation of Contemporary Women Artists in Exhibitions ==
Though efforts have been made in order to make the visual art field more inclusive, women's artworks have still been underrepresented in major [[exhibition]]s. In the late 1980s, when the first major Chinese Art exhibition took place, only five women, out of sixty-seven artists and participants, were included in the show. While artists from mainland China, [[Taiwan]], and [[Hong Kong]], were being recognized for their diverse identities, women artists' participation in this first Chinese exhibition were not acknowledged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Similarly, in the traveling exhibition, ''Transience: Chinese Experimental Art at the End of Twentieth Century'' in 1998, only three women artists presented their artworks. The curator of this exhibition, Wu Hung, intended to provide a platform for experimental Chinese art to take place. However, it appears that women's innovative artistic expressions were still being excluded and didn't gain as many recognition as male Chinese artists have had.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The issue of unequal representation among male and female Chinese artists did receive some attention from the public. As a result, curators and artists have made a joint effort to devote certain exhibition and publications solely for female artists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Century Women'', National Gallery of China, Beijing (1998) ===

''Century Women'' was one of the first exhibitions dedicated to Chinese women artists. It intended to raise awareness on female experiences, roles, subject matters, and most importantly, art practices through the perspective of women living in contemporary Chinese society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to providing a platform to showcase artworks made by Chinese women, it also exhibited photos and documents showing women's art production in China. More than seventy artists participated in this exhibition and presented over five hundred pieces of artworks&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== ''Her Presence in Colors VIII: International Women Artists Exhibition,'' National Gallery of China, Beijing (2008) ===

This exhibition was held concurrently around the world, such as China, [[Singapore]], [[Germany]], and the [[United States]], to spread pan-Asian feminist artworks. Specifically, the show in [[New York City|New York]], ''Against the Tide (1998),'' featured five female artists who were born in China and grew up during the Cultural Revolution. Cai Jin, who also participated in this show, presented her Banana Plant series in the show, which is a suggestive form of presenting female nude bodies in a public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/08/arts/art-in-review-534161.html|title=Art in Review|last=Cotter|first=Holland|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Regional Arts Boards''' (formerly Regional Arts Associations) were English regional subdivisions of the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]]&lt;ref name="ACGB &amp; RAA"&gt;{{cite web

==History==
&lt;p&gt;As the [[Arts Council of Great Britain | Arts Council]] began to move away from organising art activities in the 1950s, regional offices in England were restructured as ''Regional Art Associations (RAAs)''&lt;ref name="ACE history"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090804182015/http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/regions/information_detail.php?rid=2&amp;sid=1&amp;id=52

 | last = Arts Council England, East Midlands

 | publisher =  Arts Council England, East Midlands
 | access-date = 2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The new RAAs were intermediate organisations acting as a link between the Arts Council and the regions set up by Local Authorities or consortiums of local arts associations.&lt;ref name="ACE history"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By 1971 there were twelve associations providing funding and advice for arts organisations.&lt;ref name="ACGB &amp; RAA"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. From the early 1970s they became the responsibility of the Regional Development Department&lt;ref name="ACGB &amp; RAA"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. When it was disbanded in 1976, the RAAs came under the then Deputy Secretary General, Angus Stirling, until 1980 when a Regional Department was formed&lt;ref name="ACGB &amp; RAA"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The Wilding report of 1989 recommended the RAAs should be replaced as there was significant differences in distribution of funding between different regions.&lt;ref name="ACE history"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They were replaced by 10 ''Regional Arts Boards'' (RABs) in 1990.&lt;ref name="46th AC report"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/arts-council-46th-annual-report-and-accounts-90-91

 | publisher = [Arts Council of Great Britain 
 | access-date = 2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The new Boards received the majority of their funding directly from the Arts Council rather than local sources.&lt;ref name="ACE history"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  This changed the nature and structure of regional arts. These were independent non-profit [[private company limited by guarantee|limited by guarantee]] companies with some [[local government in England|local authority]] representation on their management boards, but the democratic role and the link between subscription and governance was broken. Payment of a subscription did not guarantee a seat or a vote.{{fact|date=March 2013}}&lt;/p&gt;

After the Arts Council of Great Britain was abolished in 1994, the RABs were transferred to a new single body: [[Arts Council England]]&lt;ref name="ACE history"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2001 it was announced that the RABS would be abolished in an effort to streamline the administration of Arts Council England.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web

to bring them into line with the then [[regional development agency areas.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rover chair''' is the first piece of furniture designed by [[industrial designer]] [[Ron Arad (industrial designer)|Ron Arad]]. It was made in 1981 as a fusion of two [[readymade]]s and launched Arad's career. The chair is a [[postmodernist]] design, combining a car seat with a [[structural tubing]] frame.

The Rover P6 is sometimes known as the 2000.

Furniture maker Joe Hall visited Arad's [[Covent Garden]] shop in the {{nowrap|mid-1980s}} and then collaborated with him to make further chairs. Hall scoured the country's scrapyards for P6 seats, which cost £5{{ndash}}£15 each and were in excellent condition.&lt;ref name="telegraph baxter 2001" /&gt;

The chairs sold for £99 each in 1981,&lt;ref name="telegraph gleadell 2009" /&gt; about three times the production cost.&lt;ref name="creativepool fountain" /&gt; Original chairs made by Arad's [[One Off(company)|One Off]] company&lt;ref name="nytimes browne 2009" /&gt; have been auctioned by [[Christie's]],&lt;ref name="christies 1994"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.christies.com/lotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=3746893 | title=SALE 6533 LOT 127 | work=[[Christie's]] | date=25 May 1994 | accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="christies 2001"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=2050456 | title=SALE 9098 LOT 322 | work=[[Christie's]] | date=16 May 2001 | accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bonhams]],&lt;ref name="bonhams 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ron Arad for One Off Ltd, a 'Rover' chair, designed 1981|url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/18807/lot/71/|work=Auction 18807|publisher=[[Bonhams]]|accessdate=19 June 2012|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bonhams 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ron Arad for One Off Ltd|url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/20166/lot/26/|work=Auction 20166|publisher=[[Bonhams]]|accessdate=19 June 2012|date=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bonhams &amp; Butterfield]]&lt;ref name="c-artsmag soetriyono 2008" /&gt; and [[Göteborgs Auktionsverk]].&lt;ref name="hittaauktion 2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hittaauktion.com/2011/11/goteborgs-auktionsverk-dags-for.html | title=Göteborgs Auktionsverk, Dags för kvalitetsauktion i Göteborg | work=hittaauktion.com | date=21 November 2011 | accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mynewsdesk 2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/pressroom/goeteborgs-auktionsverk/image/view/kvalitetsauktion-28-november-2011-auktionsnummer-37-ron-arad-102136 | title=Göteborgs Auktionsverk – Kvalitetsauktion 28 november 2011.

Her books on [[acting]] and [[declamation]] in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have become reference works,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=du même auteur |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-dix-septieme-siecle-2003-2-page-353.htm |title=De l'Art du Comédien |doi=10.3917/dss.032.0353 |website=Cairn.info |date=2007-12-01 |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hawcroft, Review on L'Art du comédien, Papers on French Seventeenth Century Literature, XXIX, 56, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;« Hors-série "Quoi de neuf Molière" », Le Figaro littéraire, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, she examined staging, the philosophy of performance&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Vinti, Review on La Philosophie de l'Acteur, Studi Francesi, anno LII, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and the economy of entertainments. She has edited almost all the theories on "actio" and [[baroque]] acting from the 1650s to the 1800s and is regarded by Konrad Schoell as "one of the most important representatives of current research into the history of the French theatre of the 17th and 18th centuries".&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Schoell, Review on Chaouche's works and La Philosophie de l'Acteur, Romanische Forschungen, 120:4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Her multidisciplinary area of expertise includes the history of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and [[trade]] in nineteenth-century Europe, as well as Oxford students' daily life in the Victorian and Edwardian eras.

She is a Fellow of the [[Royal Historical Society]] and a member of the Peer Review College of the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/peerreview/peer-review-college-membership/ |title=Peer Review College Membership - Arts and Humanities Research Council |website=Ahrc.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stippling''' is the creation of a pattern simulating varying [[Grayscale|degrees of solidity]] or shading by using small dots. Such a pattern may occur in nature and these effects are frequently emulated by artists.

==Art==
[[File:Giulio Campagnola shepherd.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''The Young Shepherd'', [[engraving]] using stipple technique by [[Giulio Campagnola]], around 1510]]
{{main|Stipple engraving}}
In a [[drawing]] or [[painting]], the dots are made of [[pigment]] of a single colour, applied with a [[pen]] or [[brush]]; the denser the dots, the darker the apparent shade—or lighter, if the pigment is lighter than the surface.  This is similar to—but distinct from—[[pointillism]], which uses dots of different colours to simulate blended colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Encyclopedia of Drawing Techniques| last=Ian Simpson| date=1987| pages=62–64| publisher=Headline| location=London| isbn=0-7472-0051-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[printmaking]], dots may be carved out of a surface to which ink will be applied, to produce either a greater or lesser density of ink depending on the printing technique. In [[Stipple engraving|engraving]], the technique was invented by [[Giulio Campagnola]] in about 1510. Stippling may also be used in engraving or [[sculpture|sculpting]] an object even when there is no ink or paint involved, either to change the texture of the object, or to produce the appearance of light or dark shading depending on the reflective properties of the surface: for instance, stipple engraving on glass produces areas that appear brighter than the surrounding glass.

The technique became popular as a means of producing shaded [[line art]] illustrations for publication, because drawings created this way could be reproduced in simple black ink.  The other common method is [[hatching]], which uses lines instead of dots.  Stippling has traditionally been favoured over hatching in [[biological illustration|biological]] and [[medical illustration]], since it is less likely than hatching to interfere visually with the structures being illustrated (the lines used in hatching can be mistaken for actual contours), and also since it allows the artist to vary the density of shading more subtly to depict curved or irregular surfaces.

Images produced by [[halftone|halftoning]] or [[dither]]ing and computer [[Computer printer|printers]] operate on similar principles (varying the size and/or spacing of dots on paper), but do so via photographic or digital processes rather than manually. These newer techniques have made it possible to convert continuous-tone images into patterns suitable for printing, but artists may still choose stippling for its simplicity and handmade appearance. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' still features stippled and hatched portraits known as [[hedcut]]s (a style brought to the WSJ by [[Kevin Sprouls]] in 1987) in its pages, a holdover from its earlier avoidance of [[photograph]]s.

==Botany==
[[Image:Music MiguelEndara.gif|thumb|upright|Artistic composition of musical elements using stippling technique.]]
In description of flora species, a stippling is a kind of pattern, especially in the case of flowering plants, produced in nature that occur on flower petals and sepals. These are similar to the dot patterns in artworks that produce an often intricate pattern. An example can be seen on the base of the petal insides of ''[[Calochortus luteus]]'', a [[lily]] endemic to [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=97686 ''Gold Nuggets: Calochortus luteus'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004094242/http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=97686 |date=2011-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term stipple can also apply to a random pattern of small depressions applied to a surface to increase the [[friction]] and make the surface easier to grip.  This process is similar to [[knurl]]ing or checkering, but is often used on complex curved surfaces, such as [[anatomical]] grips, where a regular pattern would not fit.  Stippling can be cast into [[plastic]] objects, or applied with a hammer and punch to [[wood]] or [[metal]] objects.

A further use of stipple indicates the damage caused by [[spider mites]] which make tiny white spots on plant leaves which can [[Coalescence (physics)|coalesce]] until the entire leaf appears silvery.

In quilt making, the term refers to background [[quilting]] in heirloom quilts and all-over stitching in others. It is made freehand or with free-motion [[machine quilting]] by densely stitching through all layers in a relatively close repetitive design.

In [[interior decoration]], the tips of the bristles of a [[brush|stippling brush]] are dabbed onto a freshly painted wall or surface to create a subtle design in the paint. The paint hit by the points is displaced and leaves only a thin dot of paint through which a lighter layer of colour underneath will show through.

In [[digital photography]], stippling refers to image noise similar to [[film grain]].

In [[forensic science]], stippling refers to a pattern of [[gunshot residue]] burned into the skin that results from close proximity to a discharged firearm. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://adfs.alabama.gov/Glossary.aspx |title=Glossary of Forensic Terms |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences|publisher= U.S. state government|access-date=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Street art''' is [[visual art]] created in public locations, usually unsanctioned artwork executed outside of the context of traditional art vans. Other terms for this type of art include "independent public art", "post-graffiti", and "neon-graffiti", and is closely related with [[urban outfiters]] and [[guerrilla art]].&lt;ref&gt;"Neo-graffiti" is a term coined by ''Tokion Magazine'' in the title of its Neo-Graffiti Project 2000, which featured "classic" subway surfers  graffiti artists working in new media; others have called this phenomenon "urban art." A discussion by the [[Wooster Collective]] on terminology can be found at [http://www.woostercollective.com/2004/01/what_the_hell_should_we_call_i.html WoosterCollective.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rafael"&gt;[http://www.lataco.com/interview-rafael-schacter-author-amazing-new-book-world-atlas-street-art-graffiti/ http://www.lataco.com] Interview with Rafael Schacter, Author of ''The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti'' ("...I prefer to use the term Independent Public Art...").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/city-as-canvas-and-the-world-atlas-of-street-art-and-graffiti.html https://www.nytimes.com] Aerosol Art ("...in favor of the catchall 'Independent Public Art'").&lt;/ref&gt; Common forms and media include [[aerosol paint|spray paint]] [[graffiti]], [[stencil graffiti]], [[flyposting|wheatpasted poster art]], [[sticker art]], [[street installation]]s, and [[sculpture]]. [[video design|Video projection]] and [[yarn bombing]] have also gained some popularity near the turn of the 21st century.

Street art is a form of artwork that is displayed in a community on its surrounding buildings, streets, trains, and other publicly viewed surfaces. Many instances come in the form of guerrilla art, which is composed to make a public statement about the society that the artist lives within. The work has moved from the beginnings of graffiti and vandalism to new modes where artists work to bring messages, or just simple beauty, to an audience.&lt;ref name=Antonova2014&gt;Antonova, Maria. 2014. "Street Art." Russian Life 57(5):17&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artists use "smart vandalism" as a way to raise awareness of social and political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student art project is vandalism for a cause |url=http://www.whas11.com/news/local/Student-art-project-is-vandalism-for-a-cause-86760522.html |work=The Herald-Times |accessdate=4 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320000018/http://www.whas11.com/news/local/Student-art-project-is-vandalism-for-a-cause-86760522.html |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others simply see urban space as an untapped format for personal artwork, while others may appreciate the challenges and risks that are associated with installing illicit artwork in public places. A common motive is that creating art in a format which utilizes public space allows artists who may otherwise feel disenfranchised to reach a much broader audience than other styles or galleries would allow.

Whereas traditional [[graffiti]] artists have primarily used [[aerosol paint|spray paint]] to produce their work, "street art" encompasses many other media, such as [[LED art]], [[mosaic]] tiling, [[stencil graffiti|stencil art]], [[sticker art]], [[reverse graffiti]], [[Lock On (street art)|"Lock On" sculptures]], [[street installations]], [[wheatpaste|wheatpasting]], [[woodblock graffiti|woodblocking]], [[yarn bombing]], and [[rock balancing]].&lt;ref&gt;For the development of style in the aerosol paint medium, as well as an examination of the political, cultural, and social commentary of its artists, see the anthropological history of New York subway graffiti art, ''Getting Up: Subway Graffiti in New York'', by Craig Castleman, a student of [[Margaret Mead]], The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; New media forms such as projection onto large city buildings are an increasingly popular tool for street artists—and the availability of cheap hardware and software allows street artists to become more competitive with corporate advertisements. Much like open source software, artists are able to create art for the public realm from their personal computers, similarly creating things for free which compete with companies making things for profit.&lt;ref&gt;Geek Graffiti: A Study in Computation, Gesture and Graffiti Analysis&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers use the term "independent public art" to describe a type of street art, which can also include work in remote places that may not be visited by an audience, and may also be short-lived. An ephemeral instance of colored smoke in the forest, or a precarious [[Rock balancing|rock balance]] are examples.&lt;ref name="Rafael"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filippo"&gt;[http://www.filippominelli.com/project/silence-shapes/ http://www.filippominelli.com] Filippo Minelli "''Silence/Shapes''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Schacter, author of "''The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti''", September, 2013; {{ISBN|9780300199420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynstreetart.com/theblog/2014/02/13/rafael-schacter-and-his-world-atlas-of-street-art-and-graffiti/ http://www.brooklynstreetart.com] Rafael Schacter and His "World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti."&lt;/ref&gt; Some work has been installed underwater.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bANKhbe1Vg8 https://www.youtube] Gravity Glue 2015; (Underwater [[Rock balancing|Rock balance]] at 3:55).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
Slogans of protest and political or social commentary graffitied onto public walls are the precursor to modern graffiti and street art, and continue as one aspect of the genre. Street art in the form of text or simple iconic graphics in the vein of corporate icons become well-known yet enigmatic symbols of an area or an era.&lt;ref name="Village Voice Mott"/&gt; Some credit the ''[[Kilroy Was Here]]'' graffiti of the World War II era as one such early example; a simple line-drawing of a long-nosed man peering from behind a ledge. Author [[Charles Panati]] indirectly touched upon the general appeal of street art in his description of the "Kilroy" graffiti as "outrageous not for what it said, but where it turned up".&lt;ref name="Kilroy"/&gt; Much of what can now be defined as modern street art has well-documented origins dating from [[New York City]]'s [[Graffiti in the United States|graffiti boom]], with its infancy in the 1960s, maturation in the 1970s, and peaking with the spray-painted full-car subway train murals of the 1980s centered in the [[Bronx]].

As the 1980s progressed, a shift occurred from text-based works of early in the decade to visually conceptual street art such as [[Richard Hambleton|Hambleton]]'s shadow figures.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, David (1990) ''Soho Walls&amp;nbsp;– Beyond Graffiti'', Thames &amp; Hudson, NY, {{ISBN|978-0-500-27602-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period coincides with [[Keith Haring]]'s subway advertisement subversions and [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]'s [[SAMO]] tags. What is now recognized as "street art" had yet to become a realistic career consideration, and offshoots such as [[stencil graffiti]] were in their infancy. [[Flyposting|Wheatpasted]] poster art used to promote bands and the clubs where they performed evolved into actual artwork or copy-art and became a common sight during the 1980s in cities worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}
The group working collectively as [[AVANT]] were also active in New York during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Katherine | last=Drasher | title=Avant's on the Street | date=1983-06-30 | work =The Villager | url =http://avant-streetart.com/avant_street_art_press_nyc_80s.htm | pages =31–32 | accessdate = 2009-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punk rock music's subversive ideologies were also instrumental to street art's evolution as an art form during the 1980s.  Some of the anti-museum mentality can be attributed to the ideology of [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti]] who in 1909 wrote the "[[Manifesto of Futurism]]" with a quote that reads, "''we will destroy all the museums''."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zox-Weaver|first=Annalisa|date=June 1, 2015|title=Institutional Guerilla Art Open Access: The Public Sculpture of Florentijn Hofman|url=|journal=Sculpture Review|volume=3|issue=p 22-26|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many street artists claim we do not live in a museum so art should be in public places with no tickets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Early iconic works===
[[File:Houston Street at the Bowery 2008.jpg|thumb|The 2010 recreation of [[Keith Haring]]'s original 1982 mural; New York City's [[Bowery Mural]] wall at [[Houston Street]] and the [[Bowery]]]]
The northwest wall of the intersection at [[Houston Street]] and the [[Bowery]] in New York City has been a target of artists since the 1970s. The site, now sometimes referred to as the [[Bowery Mural]], originated as a derelict wall which graffiti artists used freely. [[Keith Haring]] once commandeered the wall for his own use in 1982. After Haring, a stream of well-known street artists followed, until the wall had gradually taken on prestigious status. By 2008, the wall became privately managed and made available to artists by commission or invitation only.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

A series of murals by [[René Moncada]] began appearing on the streets of [[SoHo]] in the late 1970s emblazoned with the words ''[[I AM THE BEST ARTIST Rene|I AM THE BEST ARTIST]]''. René has described the murals as a thumb in the nose to the art community he felt he'd helped pioneer but by which he later felt ignored by.&lt;ref name="Village Voice Mott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tierney" /&gt; Recognized as an early act of "art provocation",&lt;ref name="NYPress" /&gt; they were a topic of conversation and debate at the time, and related legal conflicts raised discussion about intellectual property, artist's rights, and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="Leagle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Landes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ginsburgh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lerner" /&gt; The ubiquitous murals also became a popular backdrop to photographs taken by tourists and art students, and for advertising layouts and Hollywood films.&lt;ref name="SoHo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SoHo NY" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Film" /&gt;
''IATBA'' murals were often defaced, only to be repainted by René.&lt;ref name="NYPress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SoHo2" /&gt;

Some street artists have earned international attention for their work and have made a full transition from street art into the mainstream art world&amp;nbsp;— some while continuing to produce art on the streets. [[Keith Haring]] was among the earliest wave of street artists in the 1980s to do so. Traditional graffiti and street art motifs have also increasingly been incorporated into mainstream advertising, with many instances of artists contracted to work as graphic designers for corporations. Graffiti artist [[Eric Haze|Haze]] has provided font and graphic designs for music acts such as the [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. [[Shepard Fairey]]'s street posters of then-presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] were reworked by special commission for use in the presidential campaign. A version of the artwork also appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. It is also not uncommon for street artists to start their own merchandising lines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Street art has become more accepted by the general public, likely due to its artistic recognition and the high-profile status of [[Banksy]] and other artists. This has led street art to become one of the 'sights to see' in many European cities. Some artists now provide tours of local street art and are able to share their knowledge, explaining the ideas behind many works, the reasons for tagging and the messages portrayed in a lot of graffiti work. 
Berlin, London, Paris, Hamburg and other cities all have popular street art tours running all year round. In London alone there are supposedly ten different graffiti tours available for tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Incredible street art tours | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/picturegalleries/9880046/Incredible-street-art-tours.html | accessdate = 2015-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these organisations, such as Alternative London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Means|first1=Gary|title=Alternative London Street Art Guides|url=http://www.alternativeldn.com/best_london_tours/london_street_art_tour_guides.php|website=alternativeldn.com|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ParisStreetArt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paris Underground|url=http://undergroundparis.org/street-art-tours-paris|website=undergroundparis.org|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; AlternativeBerlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative Berlin|url=http://alternativeberlin.com/about|website=alternativeberlin.com|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; pride themselves on working with local artists, so visitors can get an authentic experience and not just a rehearsed script.

Many of these guides are painters, fine-art graduates and other creative professionals that have found the medium of street art as a way to exhibit their work. With this commercial angle they are able to let people in to the world of street art and give them more of an understanding of where it comes from. It has been argued that this growing popularity of steet art has made it a factor in [[gentrification]].&lt;ref&gt;Bross, F. (2017): [https://www.academia.edu/33405765/Beer_Prices_Correlate_with_the_Quality_of_Illegal_Urban_Art._A_Case_Study_on_the_Relationship_Between_Street_Art_and_Gentrification_in_a_Berlin_Neighborhood Beer Prices Correlate with the Quality of Illegal Urban Art.

=== Legality and ethics ===
Street art can have its own set of legal issues. The parties involved can include the artist, the city or municipal government, the intended recipient, and the owner of the structure or the medium where the work was displayed. One example is a case in 2014 in Bristol England, which exhibits the legal, moral, and ethical questions that can result. The ''Mobile Lovers'' by [[Banksy]] was painted on plywood on a public doorway, then cut out by a citizen who in turn was going to sell the piece to garner funds for a Boys Club. The City government in turn confiscated the artwork and placed it in a museum. Banksy, hearing of the conundrum then bequeathed it to the original citizen, thinking his intentions were genuine. In this case, as in others, the controversy of ownership and public property, as well as the issues of trespassing and vandalism are issues to be resolved legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salib|first=Peter|date=Fall 2015|title=The Law of Banksy: Who Owns Street Art?|url=|journal=University of Chicago Review|volume=  82|issue= 4 p293|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Street art, guerilla art, and graffiti==
Graffiti is characteristically made up of written words that are meant to represent a group or community in a covert way and in plain sight. The tell tale sign of street art is that it usually includes images, illustrations, or symbols that are meant to convey a message.&lt;ref name="Bloch2015"&gt;Bloch, Stefano. 2015. "Street Art, Public City: Law, Crime and the Urban Imagination." Urban Studies (Sage Publications, Ltd.) 52(13):2500-2503.&lt;/ref&gt; While both works are meant to represent or tell a message to viewers, one difference between the two comes in the specific viewers that it is meant for. One trait of street art that has helped to bring it to positive light in the public eye is that the messages shown in these public spaces are usually made to be understandable to all.&lt;ref name=Bloch2015/&gt;

While both of these types of art have many differences, there are more similarities than their origins. Both graffiti and street art are works of art that are created with the same intent. Most artists, whether they are working anonymously, creating an intentionally incomprehensible message, or fighting for some greater cause are working with the same ambitions for popularity, recognition, and the public display or outpouring of their personal thoughts, feelings, and/or passions.&lt;ref name=Bloch2015/&gt;

The term street art is described in many different ways, one of which is the term "guerrilla art." Both terms describe these public works that are placed with meaning and intent. They can be done anonymously for works that are created to confront taboo public issues that will result in backlash, or under the name of a well-known artist. With any terminology, these works of art are created as a primary way to express the artist's thoughts on many topics and public issues.&lt;ref name=Campos2015&gt;Campos, Ricardo. 2015. "Youth, Graffiti, and the Aestheticization of Transgression." Social Analysis 59(3):17-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

One defining trait or feature of street art is that it is created on or in a public area without or against the permission of the owner.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015/&gt; This is a trait which falls in line with that of graffiti. A main distinction between the two comes in the second trait of street art or guerrilla art, where it is made to represent and display a purposefully uncompliant act that is meant to challenge its surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015/&gt; This challenge can be granular, focusing on issues within the community or broadly sweeping, addressing global issues on a public stage.

This is how the term "guerilla art" was associated with this type of work and behavior. The word ties back to guerilla warfare in history where attacks are made wildly, without control, and with no rules of engagement. This type of warfare was dramatically different than the previously formal and traditional fighting that went on in wars normally. When used in the context of street art, the term guerilla art is meant to give nod to the artist's uncontrolled, unexpected, and often unnamed attack on societal structure or norms.&lt;ref name="Sisko2015"/&gt;

=== Guerilla sculpture ===

[[File:Rubber Duck in Los Angeles.JPG|thumb|''Rubber Duck'' by Florentijn Hofman]]

Guerilla sculpture is the placement of sculptures in street settings without official approval; it developed from street art in England in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=Sisko2015/&gt;  In addition to the nontraditional setting of the works of art involved, there are also many different techniques used in the creation of this art work. The artists tend to work illegally and in secrecy to create and place these works in the dark of night, cloaked in mystery regarding their origins and creators. The sculptures are used to express the artist's views and to reach an audience that would not otherwise be reached through more traditional methods of displaying one's work to the public. In performing these acts of artistic expression, they are not working to gain acceptance or love of the people that they reach, but at times may even anger those who view their work.&lt;ref name=Sisko2015/&gt;

An example is the overnight appearance of an unsanctioned sculpture of [[Edward Snowden]] onto a column in [[Fort Greene Park]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Sisko2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sisko|first=|date=Summer 2015|title=Guerilla Sculpture: Free Speech and Dissent|url=|journal=Sculpture Review|volume= 64|issue= 2|pages=26–35|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases the sculptures integrate two-dimensional backdrops with a three-dimensional component, such as one by Banksy titled ''Spy Booth'' (2014).  The backdrop was painted on a wall in Cheltenham, England and featured [[Cold War|Cold-War]] spy characters adorned in trench coats and fedoras, with spy accoutrements, microphones, and reel-to-reel tape decks.  These characters appeared to be [[phone tap|tapping into]] a broken telephone booth.&lt;ref name="Sisko2015"/&gt;

A deviation from unsanctioned street sculpture is "institutionalized guerilla sculpture", which is sanctioned by civic authorities and can be commercialized. One such artist from the Netherlands is [[Florentijn Hofman]], who in 2007 created ''[[Rubber Duck (sculpture)|Rubber Duck]]'', a colossal rendition of the childhood tub-toy. The [[Guardians of Time (art)|Guardians of Time]] guerrilla dOCUMENTA are social sculptures by [[Manfred Kielnhofer]].

==Public acceptance==
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] blurs the lines between public art and graffiti]]Although this type of art has become a staple of most cities around the world, the popularity of this form of artistic expression was not always so apparent as it is today. In recent years, street art has undergone a major transformation in public opinion to even become a socially accepted and respected accent to the public places that they adorn.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015&gt;Bacharach, Sondra. 2015. "Street Art and Consent." British Journal of Aesthetics 55(4):481-495&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with this push for public acceptance, the act of defacing public property with any and all message, whether it is considered art or not, has yet to become permitted or approved by the government.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015/&gt;  Today's street art, while common and growing in acceptance, is largely placed in a middle ground between an act that is against the law and a beautifully respected act of artistic expression.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the beginning, graffiti was the only form of street art that there was and it was widely considered to be a delinquent act of territorial marking and crude messaging. Initially, there was very clear divisions between the work of a street artist and the act of tagging a public or private property, but in recent years where the artists are treading the line between the two, this line has become increasingly blurred.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015 /&gt;  Those who truly appreciate the work of famed street artists or street works of art, are in acceptance of the fact that this art would not be the same without the medium being the street. The works are subject to whatever change or destruction may come due to the fact that they are created on public or private surfaces which are neither owned by the artist or permitted to be worked on by the property owners. This acceptance of the potential impermanence of the works of art and the public placement of the uncondoned works are what contribute to the meaning of the piece and therefore, what helps the growth of street art popularity.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015/&gt;

== Free art movement ==

The '''free art movement''' is the practice of artists leaving art in public places as street art, as well as being free for the public to remove and keep. The artwork is usually tagged with a notice stating it is free art, and either with the artist's name or left anonymously. The movement was reinvigorated by British artist [[My Dog Sighs]] coining the term "Free Art Fridays" and actively participating in the movement, which has since spread internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Johnathen Duran, [https://mic.com/articles/30569/free-art-friday-a-global-art-movement-everyone-can-appreciate Free Art Friday: A Global Art Movement Everyone Can Appreciate] mic.com, March 21, 2013 [retrieved 3 Dec 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Clues to the location of artworks are sometimes left on [[social media]] to combine [[Treasure hunt (game)|treasure hunting]] with art.&lt;ref&gt;Holly Roberts, [http://www.redandblack.com/culture/month-long-art-scavenger-hunt-free-art-movement-comes-to/article_1752f2b2-fc2b-11e5-b1f6-cbc8592908a3.html Month-long art scavenger hunt, Free Art Movement, comes to Classic City], TheRed&amp;Black, Apr 7, 2016 [retrieved 3 Dec 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement is distinct from the [[free culture movement]] as the artist retains full copyright for the work.

==Around the globe==
[[File:Ervin Hervé - Lóránth - Thankyoubudapest (1).JPG|thumb|''Thankyoubudapest'' (Hervé)]]
Street art exists worldwide. Large cities and regional towns of the world are home to some form of street art community, from which pioneering artists or forerunners of particular mediums or techniques emerge. Internationally known street artists travel between such locations to promote and exhibit their artwork.

===North America===
'''[[New York City]]''' attracts artists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rojo | first1=Jaime | last2=Harrington | first2=Steven P. |title=Street Art New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=391sQgAACAAJ |year= 2010 |publisher=Prestel Pub |isbn=978-3-7913-4428-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In '''[[Manhattan]]''', "post-graffiti" street art grew in the 1980s from the then largely vacant neighborhoods of [[SoHo]] and the [[Lower East Side]]. The [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] art district became another locale, with area galleries also hosting formal exhibitions of street artist's work. In '''[[Brooklyn]]''', the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] and [[Dumbo, Brooklyn|Dumbo]] neighborhoods&amp;nbsp;— especially near the waterfront&amp;nbsp;— are recognized street art sites.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Kugel (9 March 2008) [http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/travel/09weekend.html "To the Trained Eye, Museum Pieces Lurk Everywhere"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs in the [[Pennsylvania]] cities of '''[[Philadelphia]]''' and '''[[Pittsburgh]]''' provide funding to agencies who employ street artists to decorate city walls. The [[Mural Arts Program]] established in 1984 has helped Philadelphia earn praise as the "City of Murals".
The project was initiated to encourage graffiti artists toward a more constructive use of their talents. Murals backed by [[The Sprout Fund]] in Pittsburgh were named the "Best Public Art" by the ''[[Pittsburgh City Paper]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muralarts.org/about/history |title=History &amp;#124; Mural Arts Program |publisher=Muralarts.org |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hoff| first = Al| title = Best Public Art: Sprout Fund Murals| newspaper = [[Pittsburgh City Paper]]| date = 14 December 2006 | url = http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A20486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art created in conjunction with the [[Living Walls (conference)|Living Walls]] street art conference, which Atlanta hosts annually, were spared.

'''[[São Paulo]]''' is also home to an internationally recognized street art scene.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

An abundance of buildings slated for demolition provide blank canvases to a multitude of artists, and the authorities cannot keep up with removing artists output. "Population density" and "urban anxiety" are common motifs expressed by "Grafiteiros" in their street art and ''[[pichação]]'', rune-like black graffiti, said to convey feelings of class conflict.

The 1962 street installation ''Rideau de Fer'' (Iron Curtain) by [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]] is cited as an early example of unsanctioned street art. In the 1970s, the site-specific work of [[Daniel Buren]] appeared in the Paris subway.

'''The Economic Survey of the Book Industry''', known informally as '''The Cheney Report''', was a paper written by retired New York banker O.H. Cheney, between 1930 and 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfEsX04jKuUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=ted+striphas+late+age+of+print&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ_rft_YvLAhVGeSYKHW9jAzYQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Late Age of Print|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was commissioned by the [[National Association of Book Publishers]], and later published in 1932. The purpose of the report was to analyze the overall structure of the book publishing industry and to find ways to improve the system as a whole. The report advocated for several revisions to the book publishing industry including standardization of the physical size of books, increasing the number of children reading books in the education system, and constructing more bookstores in more parts of the country in the United States. Cheney also correctly anticipated the increasing demand for more books at the end of the [[Second World War]], and sought to find ways to better distribute them.

The most important contribution of The Cheney Report to the market of American book publishing, and to American culture as a whole, was his insistence on the implementation of a standardized form of communication within the book publishing world. Cheney was the first person to suggest some kind of machine based coding system for the organization of books. While he did not present a specific plan for this machine based coding system in his report, Cheney’s revolutionary ideas helped spur the creation and implementation, several decades later, of the [[International Standard Book Number]] (ISBN) that the United States adopted to categorize books.

On the 60th anniversary of The Cheney Report in 1992, Publishers Weekly reprinted the report in full and began to revisit some of the ideas the report originally proposed.

==Reception==
While the ideas presented in the report later helped establish a system as effective as the ISBN, The Cheney Report was not well received at the time of publication. Cheney claimed to have written the report “in the spirit of objective sympathy”, but the report was mostly met with harsh criticism and considered wildly ineffective by most book industry insiders at the time. Many people felt the ideas he proposed were farfetched, while today the idea of a book coding system, like the ISBN, seems completely logical. One of The Cheney Report supporters did give an alternative reading of The Cheney Report in a 1932 edition of [[Publishers Weekly]]:

{{Quote|text="Mr. Cheney was not hired to tell us what fine fellows and wonderful men we are. We must have known something was wrong with us or we wouldn't have ordered any survey...Why spend valuable time now looking at what may be wrong with Mr. Cheney? It would be more profitable for each of us to dig out of the report the mass of useful and interesting information, new information, and the many useful and definite suggestions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxODZ0Q8-HcC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=whats+changed+since+cheney&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oWoduyhc01&amp;sig=TV9Xmw7YxNN1tvpT-RBui8vJ06o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtzb_L84vLAhXLQCYKHZmvAEsQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Rise of Corporate Publishing and Its Effects on Authorship in Early ...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;|character=[[Alfred A. Knopf, Sr.]]|author=[[Publishers Weekly]]|source=January 16th, 1932}}

Almost none of the ideas presented in the report were taken seriously, and it was not until much later in American history that the machine based coding system was invented and implemented. Cheney did not gain much notoriety from this report and the report has largely gone unnoticed in current American culture. Cheney died in 1939 and never got to see his ideas and concepts implemented.

[[File:HarleianMisc.png|thumb|right|Title page from the second edition of ''Harleian Miscellany'' (1753)]]
'''''The Harleian Miscellany''''' is a collection of material from the [[library]] of the [[Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]] collated and edited by [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[William Oldys]] between 1744 and 1753 on behalf of the publisher [[Thomas Osborne (publisher)|Thomas Osborne]]. Its subtitle was  '''A Collection of Scarce, Curious, And Entertaining Pamphlets And Tracts, as well In Manuscript As In Print, Found In The Late Earl Of Oxford's Library, Interspersed With Historical, Political, And Critical Notes'''.

==Provenance==
The "late Earl of Oxford" whose library was the source of the texts could refer either to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]] (died 1724), or to his son, [[Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]] (died 1741). A passage at the beginning of the first volume emphasizes the role of Robert Harley, the first earl, in the creation of the library:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no Objection against the Prefixing the reasons for Creating the Right Honorable Robert Harley, Esq., a Peer of Great-Britain, and Earl of Oxford; especially, as the valuable Collection, intended to be published in this Form, was made by the Greatness of his Knowledge in all Branches of Learning, and at the vast Expence of that noble Family. ...his Library consisted of more than 100000 different Authors: He, I say, cannot be denied the first Place in this Miscellany, which esteems it an Honour to bear his Name.&lt;ref&gt;''The Harleian Miscellany'', vol. 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WpVCAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=harleian+miscellany&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QHn0zKwrab&amp;sig=IUkRPlFiwZx9IoUKv2GUHQ81PHU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ciA5TZL8HIO78gbd9cX1Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=robert%20harley&amp;f=false p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Edward Harley, the second earl, who had died only a few years before ''The Harleian Miscellany'' was published, was also a [[bibliophile]] who had greatly expanded the library.&lt;ref&gt;David Stoker, ‘[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12337 Harley, Edward, second earl of Oxford and Mortimer (1689–1741)]’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5753">'''Theatre criticism''' is a genre of [[arts criticism]], and the act of writing or speaking about the [[performing arts]] such as a [[play (theatre)|play]] or [[opera]].

Theatre criticism is distinct from drama criticism, as the later is a division of literary criticism whereas the former is a critique of the theatrical performance. Dramas or plays as long as they stay in the print form remain a part of literature. They become a part of the performing arts as soon as the written words of the drama are transformed into performance on the stage or any arena suitable for viewers to see. So the literary craft gives birth to a stage production. Likewise a criticism of a written play has a different character from that of a theatre performance. 

==Criticism vs Review==

There is a distinctive dissimilarity between theatre criticism and a theatre review. Both of them deal with the dramatic arts as they are performed. But they are done in different ways and for different purposes. Both have strong rationalities to support the observations expressed, both are analytical, and both deal with the commendable as well as the blemishes of the production. A theatre review is a short essay for the ordinary uninitiated readers who get to know about the play being performed, about the group staging the play, and its director and other actors. Basically a review is a subjective discourse hinting on the cultural and artistic significance of the production. The storyline is discussed as it is believed to be the mainstay of the production. The discussion reflects an instant reaction of viewing the performance. An overall clinical analysis of each department of the production, like that of acting, stage craft, lighting designs and its implementation, background scoring, dress and costume designing, make-up etc., and even the script that had been prepared for the staging, is made by the reviewer. A review is published during the period when the play is ‘on’, that is, when the play is being regularly staged. This requires a speedy writing of the piece. Thus, a review lacks any deep analytical discourse or investigative studies of the different aspects. It never gives any conclusive verdict about the production, as such. 

Theatre criticism, on the other hand, is a deep analytical discourse of the production against the backdrop of the theatre-arts as a whole. The social and political bearings that have relevance to the play are highlighted, so also the cultural import. Hence, the discussion becomes a highly theoretical objective discourse on the historical significance of the production. Criticism thus is an academic dissertation that is usually lengthy and may take a considerable time to write. The piece may be published even after the regular staging of the play has been suspended or stopped, or a subsequent production of a different play has been started by the group. Technicalities of the different aspects of the production are discussed in details together with exhaustive analysis of the rationalities of their execution. Criticism thus is an anatomical scrutiny of the production. The play is not discussed in detail as such, as it is job of the literary critic. Philosophical, political or moral criticism may be considered [[Antitheatricality|anti-theatrical]].                  

Some major [[newspapers]] cover the [[arts]] in some form and theatre [[criticism]] may be included as a part of this arts coverage. In the 21st century theatre criticism has grown in online venues, such as e-magazines and blogs, while criticism in newspapers has shrunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|title=Criticism 2.0: Benefits and Challenges of Theatre Criticism Web Sites|journal=Critical Stages|date=February 2014|issue=9|url=http://www.critical-stages.org/9/criticism-2-0-benefits-and-challenges-of-theatre-criticism-web-sites/|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research shows that despite the different medium, online critics may be as trusted as theatre critics who write for newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Drake-Brooks|first2=Malisa M.|title=Comparing the persuasiveness and professionalism of newspaper, blog, and social media sources of information in marketing and reviewing theatre|journal=Arts and the Market|date=October 2016|volume=6|issue=2|pages=166–186|doi=10.1108/AAM-03-2015-0004|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/AAM-03-2015-0004|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialist media exists to cover most artistic [[discipline]]s, in this field one such publication is ''[[The Stage]]'' (see our [[:Category:Theatre magazines|theatre magazines category]] for more).

"'''Thematic elements'''", or "'''thematic material'''", is a term used by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and other film ratings boards to highlight elements of a film that do not fit into the traditional categories such as violence, sex, drug use and language, but may involve some degree of objectionable content.  This rating reason raises a warning to parents and guardians to learn more about a film before they allow their children to view it.&lt;ref name=MPAA/&gt; 

These thematic elements may include [[autism]], [[death]], [[disease]], [[discrimination]], [[self-harm]], [[wikt:defiance|defiance]], [[child abuse]], [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional families]], [[driving under the influence]], [[sexually transmitted infection|STDs]], [[hatred|hate]], [[coming of age|coming-of-age issues]], [[crime]], [[corruption]], [[verbal abuse]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[addiction]], [[disability]], [[hazing]], [[infidelity]], [[politics]], [[social issue]]s, [[abortion]], [[religion]], and other serious subjects or mature discussions that some parents and guardians feel may not be appropriate for their young children.&lt;ref name=MPAA&gt;{{cite web|title=Reasons for Movie Ratings (CARA) FAQ|url=http://filmratings.org/filmRatings_Cara/#/ratings/faq/|work=|publisher=MPAA|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Examples==
Films with strong thematic elements include ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'', ''[[Zootopia]]'', ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]'', ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'', ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'', ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', ''[[In Her Shoes (2005 film)|In Her Shoes]]'', ''[[I Love You Phillip Morris]]'', ''[[Finding Dory]]'', ''[[My Girl (film)|My Girl]]'', ''[[Hey Arnold!: The Movie]]'', ''[[Hop (film)|Hop]]'', ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'', ''[[Warrior (2011 film)|Warrior]]'', ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'', ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'', ''[[White Oleander (film)|White Oleander]]'', ''[[42 (film)|42]]'',''[[Only Yesterday (1991 film) | Only Yesterday]]'', ''[[God's Not Dead (film)|God's Not Dead]]'', ''[[God's Not Dead 2]]'', ''[[God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness]]'', ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]'', ''[[Isle of Dogs (film)|Isle of Dogs]]'', ''[[The Secret Life of Pets 2]]'' and ''[[Wonder Park]]''. Mild thematic elements appear in many other PG and PG-13-rated drama and, primarily, documentary films.

The song appears on [[The Shadows]] [[Extended play|EP]] [[Los Shadows]], released in 1963.

==Influences on literature==
In the novel ''[[The Invention of Morel]]'', the Argentinian writer [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]] often quotes to this song, together with "[[Tea for Two (song)|Tea for Two]]". The main character is alone, in a wild island, when he starts to hear this unexpected music.
In the plot the song stands for the lightheartedness of the high society, that somehow violates the wild space of a lonely island, were the main character is literally "struggling for survival".

One can argue that Bioy Casares chose this song mainly because it was a strong symbol to represent the society of the 40's.

The saxophonist Pablo in Herman Hesse's novel ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'' mentions this song as an example of melodies quietly reproduced every night by dreamy people.
