'''Ahmed Brahim''' ({{lang-ar|أحمد إبراهيم}}, ''ʾAḥmad Ibrāhīm''; 14 June 1946 – 14 April 2016) was a Tunisian politician. He was the First Secretary of [[Ettajdid Movement]] and the leader of the [[Democratic Modernist Pole]] until April 2012, when his party merged into the [[Social Democratic Path]] of which he became the president. He was the Ettajdid Movement's candidate for [[President of Tunisia]] in the [[Tunisian general election, 2009|2009 presidential election]]. A linguist by profession, he was a professor of French at [[Tunis University]]; his area of study was [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;Walid Khéfifi. "Ettajdid : Ahmed Brahim succède à Harmel". ''[[Le Quotidien (Luxembourg)|Le Quotidien]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africanmanager.com/tunisie-ahmed-brahim-nest-plus/|title=Ahmed Brahim n’est plus - African Manager|author=Nadia Bentamansourt|work=African Manager}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tunisian Revolution==
After the fall of [[Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali]], he was appointed by the new government as the Minister of Higher Education and left the post on 7 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2011/03/01/tunisie-le-mouvement-islamiste-ennahda-legalise_1486869_3212.html|publisher=''[[Le Monde]]''|title=Tunisie : une Assemblée constituante pourrait être créée|date=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
Brahim is in favor of the emergence of a "democratic modern and ''[[laïcité|secular]]'' [laicist] state" not connected with Islamists. According to Brahim, this would require "radical" reform of the electoral system, which would improve the political climate in guaranteeing freedom of assembly and a large scale independent press, as well as repealing a law that regulated public discourse of electoral candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/ARTJAWEB20090324111744/-opposition-Ben-Ali-election-presidentielle-Ahmed-Brahim-troisieme-candidat-de-l-opposition-a-la-presidence-.html|publisher=''[[Jeune Afrique]]''|title=Ahmed Brahim troisième candidat de l'opposition à la présidence|date=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12440">'''Alcibiades Diamandi''' (in Greek: '''Αλκιβιάδης Διαμάντης''') (sometimes spelled ''Diamanti'' or ''Diamantis'') (August 13, 1893 in [[Samarina]], Greece – July 9, 1948 in [[Bucharest]], Romania) was an [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] (Vlach) political figure of [[Greece]], active during the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]] in connection with the [[Italy|Italian]] occupation forces and [[Romania]]. By 1942 he fled to Romania and after the end of the Second World War he was sentenced by the Special Traitor's Courts in Greece to death. In Romania jailed by the new Communist government and he died there in 1948.

==From Samarina to Bucharest==
Alcibiades Diamandi was born in 1894, in [[Samarina]], into a wealthy [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] (Vlach) family. He studied at the Greek Gymnasium in [[Siatista]], continuing his studies in [[Romania]] where he became involved in the Aromanian separatist movement. During the course of [[World War I]] he served as a non-commissioned officer in the Greek army. In 1917, he formed an armed Aromanian separatist band that operated in the [[Pindus]] mountains, then part of the [[Italian protectorate over Albania]]. With the tacit approval of the Italian authorities he proclaimed the foundation of the [[Principality of the Pindus]] centered in Samarina, with himself as prince. Following a diplomatic protest by Greece, Italian troops departed from [[Epirus]] as did Diamandi who was charged with sedition. Returning to Romania in the early 1920s he entered the Romanian diplomatic service and was appointed consul at [[Sarandë]] in order to influence the local Vlach population. It is believed that in 1925 he became an agent of the Italian intelligence services. Diamandi's involvement in illegal economic activities led to his removal from the Romanian diplomatic corp. In 1927, Diamandi received a pardon from the Greek government.{{sfn|Koukounas|2013|p=251}}

==The Athens years==
Shortly after the presumed amnesty, he arrived in [[Athens]]{{sfn|Koukounas|2013|pp=251–253}} as the "vice president of the National Petroleum Company of Romania", as an oil importer. This was coupled with importing lumber from Romania to Greece and some other business ventures. He rented a flat in the fashionable [[Kolonaki]] district, and frequented the bars and cafes of [[Piraeus]], where he was involved in a brawl with a Greek navy captain. During the squabble, Diamandi was wounded by a bottle flung in his direction by his adversary, and the resulting scar was used to identify him later on when he was on the run.

Diamandi frequently traveled to [[Rhodes]] (which was at the time an Italian possession), managing to attract the attention of the Greek Counter-intelligence Services. It is widely assumed that the Greek government was aware that Diamandi was an [[undercover]] Romanian agent who was trying to incite the Aromanians against the Greek state. During [[Ioannis Metaxas]]'s regime, Diamandi was served with an expulsion order, but he managed to avoid being forced out and continued his activities.

==2nd World War: The "Roman Legion" of Diamandi assists the Italian occupation forces while he promotes the idea of Vlach Autonomy==
{{main|Vlach "Roman Legion"}}
When the [[Greco-Italian War]] started, at the end of October 1940, Diamandi was already in [[Konitsa]] on the Albanian-Greek border. The invading Italians offered him the rank of ''Commendatore'', and he served as [[translation|translator]] and assistant to the Italian Chief of Staff General [https://web.archive.org/web/20060822031243/http://www.ww2.web64.dk/person/guzzoni.htm Alfredo Guzzoni]. After Italy's initial defeat, Diamandi was forced to seek refuge in [[Tirana]] (at that time under Italian rule) and re-entered Greece with the Italian armies five months later in the spring of 1941.

This time he discussed a so-called "[[Autonomy|Autonomous]] State of the Pindus" (''Αυτόνομον Κράτος της Πίνδου'') or "Autonomous Vlach State" (''Αυτόνομον Βλαχικόν Κράτος'') in the territory of [[Epirus]], [[Thessaly]] and parts of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], which was supposed to constitute a "Vlach Homeland". This planned state or canton is sometimes called "[[Principality of Pindus]]" (the name used to mainly refer to the events in Pindus in August 1917). Diamandi's deputy and right-hand was the [[Larissa]]-based lawyer [[Nicolaos Matussis]], while the third in the hierarchy of the nascent state was [[Rapoutikas Vassilis]].

In June 1941, Diamandi found himself in [[Grevena]] and then he went to [[Metsovo]], where he founded the "Party of the Kοutso-Vlach Community" (''Κόμμα Κοινότητας Κουτσοβλάχων'') which was part of the "Union of Romanian Communities" (''Ένωσις Ρουμανικών Κοινοτήτων''). A "Vlach Parliament" was summoned in [[Trikala]], but no laws were adopted&amp;mdash;since the meeting was mostly for show; the Italians were not keen on sharing power in the region.

== A Vlach Manifesto in occupied Greece ==
On March 1, 1942, Diamandi issued an ample ''Manifesto'' which was published in the local press and republished by Stavros Anthemides in 1997 (in his book on the ''Vlachs of Greece''; see bibliography).  The ''Manifesto'' was co-signed by leading Aromanians (Vlachs) intellectuals such as:
* the lawyer [[Nicolaos Matussis|Nicolaos Matussi]]
* Prof. Dimas Tioutras
* the lawyer Vasilakis Georgios
* the physician Dr. Frangkos Georgios
* the teacher A. Beca
* the businessman Gachi Papas
* the physician Dr. Nikos Mitsibouna
* Prof. Dim. Hatzigogou
* the lawyer A. Kalometros
* the engineer Niko Teleionis
* Vasilis Tsiotzios
* Prof. Kosta Nicoleskou
* Prof. Toli Pasta
* Dim. Tahas
* Prof. Stefanos Kotsios
* Prof. G. Kontoinani
* Dr. Kaloera
* Prof. Toli Hatzi
* Giovani Mertzios of [[Neveska]] (whose son [https://web.archive.org/web/20051231052940/http://www.tamos.gr/mertzos.htm Nik. Merztios], in a twist of history, is a well known pro-Greek Vlach author of Greece)
* [[Pericli Papas]]
* Prof. Virgiliu Balamace (related to Nick Balamace, currently the Secretary of the [http://www.farsarotul.org 'Society Farsarotul'] in the [[United States]])
* ing. S. Pelekis
* K. Pitouli
* the lawyer Toli Hatzis
* Dim. Barba

Two Vlachs of Albania and [[Bulgaria]], Vasilis Vartolis and the Samarina born writer [[Zicu Araia]], also endorsed the ''Manifesto''.  In Romania, it was co-signed by the [[Veria]]-born [[George Murnu]], a professor at the [[University of Bucharest]].  Diamandi travelled to Bucharest shortly after he met Murnu, and together they attended a meeting with the then Leader (''Conducător'') of Romania Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]], and the Foreign Minister [[Mihai Antonescu]]. The status of the Principality of Pindos was discussed.

One option favoured by Diamandi was to put the Principality under the sovereignty of the [[King of Romania|Romanian Crown]] (as an associated "free state"). Another option was to link the principality to the ruling Italian [[House of Savoy]]. None of these options was to be realised.

==Refuge in Romania==
Towards the second year of the Italian occupation, [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] actions broke out in the area, between the [[Greek Civil War#Background: 1941–44|Greek Resistance]] supported by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] and the Italo-[[Nazi Germany|German]] side. The chaos that ensued drove Diamandi to leave (either that or he was ordered back) to Romania. Diamandi was arrested by the Romanian Communist Secret Service ”[[Securitate]]”  on February 21, 1948. He died in the Prefecture of Police in Bucharest some months later supposedly under torture by Soviet Agent [[Mișu Dulgheru|Mihail Dulgheru]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ziarelive.ro/stiri/efectul-cazului-visinescu-procurorii-au-redeschis-dosarul-unui-alt-tortionar-al-securitatii-dupa-ce-gandul-a-relatat-despre-caz.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Matoussi escaped, first to Athens then to Romania too, while Rapoutikas was shot dead by one of the Greek factions involved in guerilla activities just outside Larissa (the Greeks then tied his corpse on the back a donkey and paraded him through the Vlach villages of the Pindus - this was intended in order to scare the local populace and as a final proof that the so-called Roman Legion had reached its end).

==Mysterious Diamandi's incomplete life story==
There are many gaps in the biography of the secretive Prince Diamandi, and he is scarcely mentioned in most of the few books that deal with the period. According to the German scholar Dr. Thede Kahl (see bibliography), Diamandi was for a while [[Kingdom of Romania]]'s Consul in the Albanian port [[Vlorë]] just opposite across the strait of the Italian town of [[Otranto]]. The Greek historians usually avoid mentioning him altogether, while other scholars who give vague reference to him (such as{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliopolis.de/thetis3.html |title=Lena Divani |accessdate=2013-09-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818184104/http://www.bibliopolis.de/thetis3.html |archivedate=2007-08-18 |df= }}  or Mark Mazower) make sure that they clearly distance themselves from Diamandi hence bestowing upon him apelatives like "extremist" and "shameful", failing to bring to the surface new data or impartial information as to the personality of Diamandi.

Alkiviadis Diamandi is given mention in 1995 by the British author [https://web.archive.org/web/20060107095005/http://www.lively-arts.com/books/unwritten_places.htm Tim Salmon] in his book about the Vlachs of Greece (see bibliography) as follows:
:''A pro-Mussolini teacher called Dhiamantis who returned to Samarina during the Occupation and tried to set up a fascist Vlach state the [[Principality of Pindus]]. It is possible that the idea of autonomy struck a chord in some nationalistic Vlach breasts but they certainly were not the collaborators he accused them of being.''
The author finds the precedents of Diamandi's movement in the Vlachs' desire of separateness, which he sees as a sign of "strength". Other passages of his book emphasize this aspect as well.

He writes:
:''Up to the 1920s the Vlakholoi - the Vlach clan as it were- had been so strong that the government could not really interfere with them. There had been Romanian schools (financed from Romania from around the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1881 which forced the Turks to cede Thessaly to Greece, drawing the frontier through Metsovo and thus dividing the Greek Vlachdom in [[Ioannina|Yannina]], Thessaloniki and [[Grevena]] up until 1940. In fact, there was one in Samarina itself.''

'''Alfred Klahr''' (16 September 1904, Vienna - 1944, Warsaw) was an [[Austria]]n [[communist]] politician, journalist and historian. He was the leading [[Marxism–Leninism|marxist]] intellectual and theorist in the [[First Austrian Republic]].
  
== Biography ==
Alfred Klahr was born on 16 September 1904 in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klahrgesellschaft.at/Klahr_Leben.html Alfred Klahr (1904–1944)]. klahrgesellschaft.at&lt;/ref&gt; His father Salman Klahr worked as [[hazzan]] in [[Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien]]. Becoming a student at the [[University of Vienna]], Alfred Klahr joined the ''Kommunistischen Jugendverband''. 
From 1930 Klahr lived in Moscow and worked as representative of the Communist Youth Union of Austria. From 1935 to 1937 he taught in Austrian section of [[International Lenin School]]. In 1937 Klahr turned to Prague and worked in communist newspaper ''Weg und Ziel''. From 1938 - after [[Anschluss]] and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|annexation of Czechoslovakia]] - Alfred Klahr was active in [[Anti-fascism|anti-nazi]] [[Austrian Resistance]]. From August 1942 he was detained in [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] (as Ludwig Lokmanis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polskieradio.pl/227/4262/Artykul/1354696,Ruchy-oporu-w-AuschwitzBirkenau Ruchy oporu w Auschwitz-Birkenau]. polskieradio.pl&lt;/ref&gt;
prisoner number 58933). He was member of [[Kampfgruppe Auschwitz]]. 15 June 1944 Alfred Klahr (together with polish communist, [[Polish Workers' Party|PPR]] member, Stefan Bratkowski) managed to escape, but he died afterward, shot by the [[SS]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|nazi-occupied]] Warsaw.

== Klahr's theory of the national question in Austria == 
In March and April 1937 Klahr published the series of articles titled  ''Zur nationalen Frage in Österreich''. In these texts he explain how the Austria emerged from the German part of Europe to take another political direction.

{{Quote box|quote="The view that the Austrian people are a part of the German nation is theoretically unfounded. A union of the German nation, in which also the Austrians are included, never existed and does not exist today either. The Austrian people have lived under different economic and political conditions than the remaining Germans in the "Reich", and have therefore chosen another national development.

[[File:Blason Armand Joseph Dubernad.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Coat of arms : du Bernad or Dubernad]]

'''Armand Joseph Dubernad''' was born 23 November 1741, in [[Bayonne]]. He died 9 May 1799, in [[Morlaix]].

Armand Joseph Dubernad was a merchant, a French and Spanish financier, [[Consul general]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], deputy, mayor, and cofounder of the first [[Jacobin Club]] of [[Brittany]].

== Biography ==

Dubernard was the son of a middle-class man of [[Bayonne]]. But, his family originally came from [[La Bastide-Clairence]] and before that from [[Laplume]], in the north of [[Gascony]].

== Before the Revolution ==

[[Image:Francisco Cabarrús.jpg|thumb|right|120px|A member of his family, [[François Cabarrus]], by  [[Francisco Goya|Goya]].]]

Before the French revolution started, Armand Joseph Dubernad traded with China, Europe, Eastern and Western Indies, with [[Morlaix]], [[Seville]] and [[Cadiz]]. He was one of the principal shareholders of the [[Bank of Spain|bank of Saint-Charles]] and various companies which finance great work and contribute to reduce the Spanish debt. His close cousin, the count [[François Cabarrus]], was Minister of king [[Charles III of Spain]]. His cousins, the Lesseps, his father-in-law, his brother-in-law and his brother are diplomatic wealthy persons. Dubernad also plays a part of precursor in the field of [[marine insurance]].

== During the Revolution ==

[[Image:Château de La Bourdaisière.JPG|thumb|left|350px|His castle named [[château de la Bourdaisière]].]]

In 1788, he was appointed deputy of the [[Estates of the realm|Third Estate]] in [[Rennes]], then appointed [[Bailiwick|Sénéchaussée]] of [[Morlaix]]. In 1789, Armand Joseph Dubernad is listed among the writers of the ''Cahiers de Doléances'' (= Register of grievances) of the city. In 1790, he is the cofounder of the first [[Jacobin Club]] of [[Brittany]], of which he became president.

During [[Reign of Terror|The Terror]], Armand Joseph Dubernad rebuilt one of the castles of the wife of [[Philippe Egalité]], ''La Bourdaisière'', near from  [[Montlouis]] destroyed following a whim of [[Etienne François de Choiseul]].

After Thermidor, in the night of the 14 to 15 Vendémiaire An IV (6 October to 7th, 1795), a poster is placarded with [[Morlaix]], denouncing Dubernad as an ''aristocrat, royalist and banker of [[François-Athanase Charette de La Contrie|Charette]]''. It was signed by the brother of the [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Général Moreau]] and by others former prisoners of the revolutionary jails.

Dubernad died in 1799, almost ruined because of the English blockade, and loans to help the poor or to finance the revolutionary festivals.

== The family ==

[[Image:Françoise Gaudelet d'Armenonville.jpg|thumb|200px|His granddaughter, Françoise Gaudelet d'Armenonville.]]

His father-in-law and then his brother-in-law, Jean and Gaspard Lannux de La Chaume are Consuls of Spain in France, before the Revolution. His son married the daughter of [[Michel Behic]], niece of the first French constitutional bishop, [[Louis-Alexandre Expilly de la Poipe]], and also sister-in-law of the brother of the [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau|Général Moreau]].

Armand Joseph Dubernad is [[Consul general]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in [[Morlaix]]. His brother, Salvat du Bernad, in the same time, is before the French Revolution, a rich trader and a very important financier of [[Seville]] and the Consul of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] in France and Spain. But, his brother will be imprisoned as of the entry in war of the Spain to have supposedly wanted to set fire to the manufacture of the tobaccos of [[Seville]]. During the [[Peninsular War]], he will be the consular agent of France, in Seville until in 1812.

His granddaughter, Françoise Gaudelet d'Armenonville will marry Auguste de Rambaud, who is the son of [[Agathe de Rambaud]], then in her second marriage to the count Amédée d'Allonville.

His grandson, the captain Henry Dubernad is the nephew of the French Vice Admiral [[Jacques Bergeret]]. In 1796, his uncle, Bergeret, as captain of the frigate 'La Virginie', was captured by Sir [[Edward Pellew]] in the ''Indefatigable''. An English offer to exchange him for [[William Sidney Smith|Sir Sidney Smith]] was refused by the French. On Smith's escape in 1798, Bergeret was sent home unconditionally by the English.

'''August Raimond Bogusch''' (5 August 1890 – 28 January 1948) was an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-''[[Scharführer]]'' and member of staff at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. He was prosecuted at the [[Auschwitz Trial]], sentenced to death and hanged.

== Life ==
Bogusch was born in [[Lubliniec]], [[Upper Silesia]]. He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in October 1932 and the SS in April 1933 (number 51922). On 21 August 1939 he was drafted into the [[SS-Totenkopfverbände]] and was posted to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]. 
He was at Auschwitz from 27 January 1941 to 18 January 1945, where he was - among other things - a ''Schutzhaftlagerführer'' (protective custody) guard and a ''Blockführer'' (''block leader''). After the evacuation of Auschwitz he was sent to Mysen concentration camp near [[Oslo]], and in February 1945, was transferred back to Buchenwald. He was also deployed to [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]].

In the summer of 1943, Bogusch participated in the extermination process, where he selected Jews from arriving transports to the [[gas chamber]]s. During the occupation of Poland, the Polish underground declared on London radio that he would be punished by death.

=== After the war ===
Bogusch was captured by the Allies and released to the Polish authorities. He was tried by the [[Supreme National Tribunal]] in [[Kraków]] and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. His sentenced was carried out by [[hanging]] in [[Montelupich Prison]], Kraków.

The '''Avars''' ({{lang-av|аварал / магIарулал}}, ''awaral / maⱨarulal''; "mountaineers") are a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]] native ethnic group who are the predominant of several ethnic groups living in the Russian republic of [[Dagestan]].&lt;ref name="2010Census"&gt;{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Avars reside in a region known as the [[North Caucasus]] between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea]]s. Alongside other ethnic groups in the North Caucasus region, the Caucasian Avars live in ancient villages located approximately 2,000 m above [[sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pagani|first=Luca|title= High altitude adaptation in Daghestani populations from the Caucasus|journal=Human Genetics|date=9 September 2011|volume=131|issue=3|pages=423–33|doi=10.1007/s00439-011-1084-8 |pmid=21904933|pmc=3312735|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Avar language]] spoken by the Caucasian Avars belongs to the family of [[Northeast Caucasian languages]] and is also known as Nakh–Dagestanian. [[Islam]] has been the prevailing religion of the Avars since the 13th century.

==Ethnonyms==
According to 19th-century Russian historians, Avarians' neighbors usually referred to them by the [[exonym]]s ' '''Tavlins''' (''tavlintsy''). [[Vasily Potto]] wrote that those to the south usually knew them as Tavlins (''tavlintsy''). "The words in different languages have the same meaning ... [of] mountain dwellers [or] highlanders".&lt;ref name ="Кавказская война"&gt;''В. А. Потто.'' [http://thelib.ru/books/vasiliy_aleksandrovich_potto/kavkazskaya_voyna_tom_2_ermolovskoe_vremya-read-14.html Кавказская война в отдельных очерках, эпизодах, легендах и биографиях]: в 5 т. – СПб.: Тип. Е. Евдокимова, 1887–1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolai Fedorovich Dubrovin|Nikolai Dubrovin]] wrote: "[[Chechnya]], with its rich mountain pastures, mountain slopes covered with dense forest, with its plain, irrigated by many rivers and rich vegetation, is a perfect contrast to the neighbouring barren and rocky parts of Dagestan populated by an Avarian tribe".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} 

The name Tavlin is believed to be from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] ''tau'', meaning "mountain".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Those known as Tavlins usually have origins in the upper parts of two tributaries of the [[Sulak River]]: the [[Andiyskoe Koisu]] and [[Avarskoye Koisu]].&lt;ref name ="История войны и владычества русских на Кавказе"&gt;[http://www.runivers.ru/bookreader/books/9700/0513.gif :''Том I. Книга 1. Дубровин Николай Федорович.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Potto also claimed that members of  Avarian tribe also often referred to themselves by the alternate [[endonym]] ''maarulal'', also meaning "mountaineer".&lt;ref name ="Кавказская война"/&gt;

== History ==
According to the historian [[Sergey Tolstov]],  Avarians originated in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], south-east of the [[Caspian Sea]], and migrated to the Caucasus.&lt;ref name="Tolstov"&gt;Sergei Pavlovich Tolstov, ''Ancient Khwarezm'' (1948), Moscow&lt;/ref&gt; These geographical origins apparently link them to the [[Hurrians]] of [[Subartu]].&lt;ref name="Tolstov"/&gt; 

The earliest mention of the Avars in European history is by [[Priscus]], who reported in 463 AD that a combined legation from the [[Saragur]]s, [[Urog]]s and [[Unogur]]s had requested an alliance with Byzantium. The legation claimed that in 461 their peoples had been displaced by the [[Sabirs]], as a result of pressure from the Avars.&lt;ref name="Priscus"&gt;Priscus. ''Excerpta de legationibus''. Ed. S. de Boor. Berolini, 1903, p. 586 &lt;br /&gt;Also mentioned in the Syrian compilation of Church Historian [[Zacharias Rhetor]] bishop of Mytilene&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear whether or in what way the Caucasian Avarians are related to the early [[Pannonian Avars|"Pseudo-Avars"]] (or Pannonian Avars) of the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], but it is known that with the mediation of [[Sarosius]] in 567, the [[Göktürks]] requested Byzantium to distinguish the Avars of Pannonia as "Pseudo-Avars" as opposed to the true Avars of the east, who had come under Göktürk hegemony.&lt;ref name="Sarosius"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/Articles/alemany_abs.html|title=ALEMANY - Sixth Century Alania - Transoxiana Eran ud Aneran|website=www.transoxiana.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern ''Arab Encyclopaedia'' states that the Magyars originated in this area.

The Avar invasion of the Caucasus resulted in the establishment of an Avar ruling dynasty in [[Sarir]], a medieval Christian state in the Dagestani highlands.

[[File:Swastika avarian Dagh.JPG|thumb|200px|Old Avarian popular symbols appearing on stone and felt]]

During the [[Khazar]] wars against the [[Caliphate]] in the 7th century, the Avars sided with Khazaria. Surakat is mentioned as their [[Khagan]] around 729–30 AD, followed by Andunik-Nutsal at the time of [[Abu Muslima]], then Dugry-Nutsal. Sarir suffered a partial eclipse after the Arabs gained the upper hand, but managed to reassert its influence in the region in the 9th century. It confronted the weakened Khazars and conducted a friendly policy towards the neighbouring Christian states of Georgia and [[Alania]].

In the early 12th century, Sarir disintegrated, to be succeeded by the [[Avar Khanate]], a predominantly Muslim polity.&lt;ref name="Soviet Empires pg. 58"&gt;''An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires'', by James Stuart Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas Charles Pappas, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The only extant monument of Sarir architecture is a 10th-century church at the village of [[Datuna]]. The [[Mongol invasions]] seem not to have affected the Avar territory, and the alliance with the [[Golden Horde]] enabled the Avar khans to increase their prosperity. In the 15th century the Horde declined, and the [[Shamkhalate of Kazi-Kumukh]] rose to power. The Avars could not compete with it and were incorporated by them.

From the 16th century onwards, the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] and [[Ottomans]] started consolidating their authority over the entire Caucasus, and divided and consolidated most of its territory for themselves. By the mid-16th century, what is now Eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Dagestan]], nowadays [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Armenia]] was under [[Safavid Empire|Safavid Persian]] rule,&lt;ref&gt;''A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East'', Vol. II, ed. Spencer C. Tucker, (ABC-CLIO, 2010). 516.&lt;/ref&gt; while what is now Western Georgia fell under Ottoman Turkish suzerainty.&lt;ref&gt;"The Reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, 1520–1566", V.J. Parry, ''A History of the Ottoman Empire to 1730'', ed. M.A. Cook (Cambridge University Press, 1976), 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dagestan was once briefly gained by the [[Ottoman Turks]] through the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1578–1590)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578–1590]], Dagestan and many of its Avar inhabitants stayed under Persian suzerainty for many centuries. However, many ethnic groups in Dagestan, including many Avars, retained relatively high amounts of freedom and self-rule. After losing the Caucasus briefly in the early 18th century, following the disintegration of the Safavids and the [[Russo-Persian War (1722–1723)|Russo-Persian War of 1722–1723]], the Persians reestablished full control over the Caucasus again in the early 18th century under [[Nader Shah]] through his [[Caucasus Campaign (1735)|Caucasian campaign]] and [[Nader's Dagestan campaign|Dagestan campaign]]. During that same time, the Avars increased their prestige by routing an army of Nader Shah at [[Andalal]] during the later stages of his Dagestan campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Ramazan Gadzhimuradovich Abdulatipov. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cAYhAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=nader+shah+andalal&amp;dq=nader+shah+andalal&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMI5O2o-9HnxgIVxqZyCh0ePgpN ''Russia and the Caucasus: On the Arduous Path to Unity'']. Edwin Mellen Press, 2000. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of this triumph, [[Umma Khan]] of the Avars (who reigned 1774–1801) managed to exact tribute from most states of the Caucasus, including [[Shirvan]] and Georgia.

Two years after Umma Khan's death in 1801, the khanate voluntarily submitted to Russian authority following the Russian annexation of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]], but this only got confirmed after considerable Russian successes and the victory in the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–1813)|Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813]], after which Persia lost southern [[Dagestan]] and many of the rest of its [[Caucasus]] territories to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Baddeley, ''The Russian Conquest of the Caucasus'', Longman, Green and Co., London: 1908, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; The 1828 [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] indefinitely consolidated Russian control over Dagestan and other areas where the Avars lived and removed Iran from the military equation.&lt;ref&gt;Aksan, Virginia. (2014). ''Ottoman Wars, 1700–1870: An Empire Besieged''. p. 463. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-1317884033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian administration disappointed and embittered the freedom-loving highlanders. The Russians' institution of heavy taxation, coupled with the expropriation of estates and the construction of fortresses, electrified the Avar population into rising under the aegis of the Muslim [[Imamate of Dagestan]], led by [[Ghazi Mohammed]] (1828–1832), [[Gamzat-bek]] (1832–1834) and [[Imam Shamil|Shamil]] (1834–1859).

This [[Caucasian War]] raged until 1864, when the Avarian Khanate was abolished and the [[Avarian District]] was instituted instead. One portion of the Avars refused to collaborate with Russians and migrated to Turkey, where their descendants live to this day. Although the population was decimated through war and emigration, the Avars retained their position as the dominant ethnic group in Dagestan during the Soviet period. After [[World War II]], many Avars left the barren highlands for the fertile plains closer to the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]].

== Description ==
[[File:Chechnya and Caucasus.png|thumb|right|250px|Map of the North Caucasus region]]

Avarians are a Northeast Caucasian people with a [[Northeast Caucasian language]]. Another tribe with common name "Aβar" according to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', "one of a people of undetermined origin and language",&lt;ref&gt;Avar // ''Encyclopædia Britannica 2007 Ultimate Reference Suite''. Chicago: ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt; was the so-called [[Turanian language|Turanian]] nomad people, which to make their presence as "Pseudo-Avars"—in opinion of ruler of Turkic qaganate (Gőktürks)—in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;(Rásonyi, László ''Tarihte Türklük''.-Ankara:-TKAE RAS, 1971,s.79)&lt;/ref&gt;

Avarians inhabit most of the mountainous part of Dagestan as well as portions of the plains (Buynaksk, Khasav'yurt, Kizil'yurt and other regions). They also live in [[Chechnya]], [[Kalmykia]] and other regions of the [[Russia]]n state, as well as in [[Azerbaijan]] (mainly in the [[Balakan Rayon|Balakan]] and [[Zaqatala (rayon)|Zakatala]] rayons, with a population of 50,900 in 1999&lt;ref name=azer&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/resource/azerbaijan/hypermail/200103/0062.html Devlet İstatistik Komitesi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223062713/http://www.eurasianet.org/resource/azerbaijan/hypermail/200103/0062.html |date=23 December 2007 }}, [http://ii-elm.az/view.php?lang=az&amp;menu=21&amp;id=14 Azərbaycan Milli Elmlər Akademiyası İqtisadiyyat İnstitutu]{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 49,800 in 2009&lt;ref name="azer2009" /&gt;) and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (Kvareli Avars with 1,996 people in 2002&lt;ref name="georgia" /&gt;).

In 2002, Avarians, who have assimilated with ethnic groups speaking related languages, numbered about 1.04 million, of which 912,020 live in Russia (2010 census).&lt;ref name="rus-census" /&gt; Of those living in Russia, 850,011 are in Dagestan (2010 census),&lt;ref name="rus-census" /&gt; 32% of them in cities (2002).{{Citation needed|date=August 2008|reason=please give sources for those 3 remaining figures}}
[[File:Khunz Wolf 3b.svg|130px|thumb|right|Symbol of the Avarian Khanate]]

In [[Turkey]], the population census figures for the North Caucasian population are not given as they are considered as "ethnic Turks". According to Ataev B.M., according to A.M. Magomeddadaev's research, the Avarian population there should have been around 53,000 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;(Ataev B.M ''Avars: Language, History, Writing''.-Machachkala:DSC RAS, 2005, {{ISBN|5-94434-055-X}} p.21)&lt;/ref&gt;
Avarians call themselves "Awaral" (also "Ma'arulal").

== Ethnic subgroups ==
Avarian is a collective term for the [[Avar–Andi–Dido peoples|Avar-Andi-Dido (Tsez)]] peoples and generalizes to various ethnic groups native to the foothills.

== Avarians as highlanders and armed people ==
"МагIарулал" ''Ma'arulal'' means "inhabitants of the top grounds, mountaineers", but another group of Avarians is described as belonging to another category, "Хьиндалал" ''X'indalal'' (with a soft "χ"), namely, "inhabitants of plains (warm valleys) and gardeners".&lt;ref&gt;(Islammagomedov A.I. Avarcy. Maakhachkala, 2002. S. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Avarians'' has a narrower meaning for Avarians, especially a national one connected with former statehood. "Avar" is a significant part of the word "Avaria" for the [[Khunzakh]] Khanate that formed approximately in the 12th century after the disintegration of the local Sаrir ("The Throne") empire. From the middle of the 19th century this territory was the Avarian District of the Daghestanian area. Now it is [[Khunzakhsky District]] (χunzaχ in a literary Avarian language or χwnzaa in a local dialect) of Dagestan.&lt;ref&gt;(Kommentarii i primechania Z.Bunijatova//Bakikhanov A.K. ''Gulistan-Iram''. Baku: Elm, 1991, {{ISBN|5-8066-0236-2}}, p. 219)&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern literary language of Avarias (Awar mac'), both in olden times and today, is known among Avarians as the language of "boʔ" (bolmac'). The Avarian word "bo" "army, armed people", according to reconstructions, was originally '''*ʔωar'''&lt;ref&gt;(Chirikba V.A. Baskskij i severokavkazskije hazyki//Drevnja Anatolija. Moscow. Nauka, 1985, p. 100; See also: Nikolaev S.L., Starostin S.A. ''A North Caucasian etymological dictionary''. Moscow, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; in the proto-Avarian language ("ʔ" is here a glottal stop).

== Usage of the name "Avarians" ==
{{Cleanup section|reason=''Needs improvement in the general standard of written English/encyclopedic style (e.g. grammar, syntax and sentence structure; use of [[WP:UCN|common names]]/spellings; too few links to other articles)''.|date=May 2015}}

At the same time, in modern Avarian there are three words retaining their ancient basis of "awar": awarag "the envoy, prophet, messiah", awara "obstacle, opposition"&lt;ref&gt;Saidov M.S. ''Avarsko-Russkij slovar'.'' Moscow, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; (awara habize is "to make an obstacle, to resist") and awari "pommel of a saddle".&lt;ref&gt;(Saidov M.S., Mikailov Sh. ''Russko-Avarskij Slovar'', Makhachkala, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an Avarian river – "Awar ʕωr" (in Avarian) and "Avar koysu" in Russian.

All three listed words are to be found in ancient lexicons of the [[Iranian languages]]: [[Parthia]]n "apar" Pahlavi/Middle-Pers. abar/aβar = "up, on, over" and "higher, superior" (also abraz "acclivity"); abarag/aβarag "superior", abargar/aβargar "god, divinity", abarmanig/aβarmanig "noble";&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie D.N. ''A Concise Pahlavi Dictionary''. Oxford University Press, London, 1971, {{ISBN|0-19-713559-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; apar amatan "to surpass", apar kardan/apar handaχtan "to attack".&lt;ref&gt;Rastorgueva V.S. ''Srednepersidskij jazyk'', "Nauka", Moscow, 1966. S. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, according to the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and grammatic rules of the Middle-Persian language, Aβarag "superior" can also be translated as "Aβarian", "Khurasanian", "Parthian" as seen, for example, in a Middle-Persian word, Eranag – "Iranian".

The term "Avar" was known in the 10th century. According to [[Persian people|Persian]] author [[Ahmad ibn Rustah|Ibn Rustah]] a so-called governor of [[Sarir]], the first authentic mention of a population of Daghestanian Highlanders under the name "Avars" belongs to Yohann de Galonifontibus, who wrote in 1404 that in the Caucasus there live "Circassians, Leks, Yasses, [[Alans]], Avars, Kazikumukhs".&lt;ref&gt;Takhnaeva P.I. ''Hristianskaja kul'tura srednevekovoj Avarii (VII–XVI vv.) v kontekste rekonstrukcii politicheskoj istorii''. Makhachkala: Epokha, 2004. S. 8&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vladimir Minorsky, in Zafer, (written in 1424), Daghestanian Avars are called the Auhar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odnapl1yazyk.narod.ru/hudud4749.htm |title=hudud4749 |publisher=Odnapl1yazyk.narod.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbas Kuli-Aga-Bakikhanov in his book Gulistan-i Iram (1841) based on the chronicle "Derbend-name" wrote that the "inhabitants of vicinities of Agran have been moved here from [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]. A residence of this emir also was Agran".&lt;ref&gt;Bakikhanov A.K. ''Gulistan-Iram''. Baku: Elm, 1991, {{ISBN|5-8066-0236-2}}. S. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The editor of this book, an academician of the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan, Z.M. Buniyatov, confirms that the district of Agran corresponds to the [[Caucasian Avaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakikhanov A.K., p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; This word "Agran" is now unknown to modern Avars, but according to the ''Altiranisches Wörterbuch'' of Christian Bartholomae, aγra means ''erste, oberste; Anfang, Spitze'' (first, upper, beginning, tip) and aγra'va ''vom Obersten, von der Oberseite stammend'' (from the top, coming from the upper side).&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomae, Christian. Altiranisches Wörterbuch, Verlag von Karl J.Trübner, Strassburg, 1904, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Nöldeke, Hübschmann, Frye, Christensen and Enoki identify the Aparshahr/Abarshahr/Abharshahr/Abrashahr with Khurasan, or Nishapur.&lt;ref name="transoxiana.org"&gt;http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/Articles/Tezcan_Apar.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Khurasan (χwarasan) in Iranian studies known as "rise of Sun", Parthian ''apar'' (Middle Persian/Pahlavi ''abar''/''aβar'' "up, on, over" and Parthian/Middle Persian ''šahr'' are cognate with old Iranian ''χšaθra'' "empire, power, the sovereign house".) In summary, Aparšahr/Aβaršahr is very similar to the German word ''Oberland''. According to H.W. Haussig, Aβaršahr means ''Reich der Abar'' (kingdom of the Abar) and should be sought in the south-western territory of the Western Turkish Empire.

A [[Dahae]] tribe, the Aparnak ([[Parni]]) moved from the south-eastern shore of the Caspian (now part of modern [[Turkmenistan]]), into the territory of Khurasan (including the area of [[Gorgan]]), where they founded a Dahae confederation of tribes that was referred to as "barbarians" and "enemies of Aryans" in Avestani texts, according to Christian Bartholomae.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomae, Christian. ''Altiranisches Wörterbuch''. Strassburg: Verlag von Karl J. Trübner, 1904, s. 744&lt;/ref&gt;

On the border of Khurasan, the [[Sassanides]] built a strong wall, named the "[[Great Wall of Gorgan]]" or "The Red Snake", was built to protect Iran from invasion by the so-called [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]] ([[Hepthalites]]; Khionites, X'iiaona and Xyôn in [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] texts).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.univie.ac.at/chwh/content/recentpublications/cac_ii.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Later another wave of White Huns obtained control over Khurasan and kept it for a long time. According to Richard Helli: "By such reasoning, the Ephthalites are thought to have originated at Hsi-mo-ta-lo (southwest of [[Badakhshan]] and near the [[Hindu Kush]]), which tantalizingly, stands for Himtala, "snow plain", which may be the [[Sanskrit]]ized form of Hephthal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/pak_history/hephthalites.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:09:20&lt;/ref&gt; In 484 the Hephthalite chief Akhshunwar led his army to attack the Sassanian King Peroz (459–484), who was defeated and killed in Khurasan. After the victory, the Hephthalite empire extended to [[Merv]] and [[Herat]]. Some of the White Huns concluded a peace treaty with Iran and the two became allies, both fighting against [[Byzantium]]. Thus, Hephthalites really lived in the Khurasan/Khorasan area. According to the [[China|Chinese]] classic [[Liang chih-kung-t'u]], 滑 (pinyin: hua) was the name the Hephthalites used for themselves, and that is probably a Chinese transfer of a similar-sounding word, war/Uar.

Mehmed Tezcan writes that according to a Chinese record, the Hephthalites descended from a Ruan Ruan tribe called Hua in the Qeshi region (Turfan area). This tribe came to Tokharistan and soon settled also in eastern regions of Khorasan at the beginning of the 5th century. About the same time, the name Avars/Awards appears in the sources. Again, in his well-known Atlas of China, A. Herrmann shows the eastern regions of Khorasan, Tokharistan, etc. as the dominions of Afu/Hua/Awards/Hephthalites between ca. 440 and 500 A.D., relying on the identification Hua = Uar = Awar.&lt;ref name="transoxiana.org"/&gt;

The German researcher [[Menges,Karl Heinrich|Karl Menges]], well known in the scientific world, considered Eurasian Avars to be one of the ancient Mongol peoples, who "were the first to use the title ga gan (later qān, ḵān) for their supreme ruler." Further listing ancient Mongol speaking peoples, he obviously has in view Avars Caucasian when he mentions the "traces of a Mongol residue in Daghestan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/altaic-the-altaic-peoples-and-languages-are-distributed-around-45-north-latitude-from-eastern-europe-to-the-pacific-ocean |work=Encyclopædia Iranica |title=Altaic |date=2 August 2011 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the so-called old Turanian nomad horde "infiltrate" point of view (with various clauses) include the following scientists: [[Marquart,Josef|Josef Marquart]], [[Pritsak, Omeljan|Omeljan Pritsak]], Vladimir Minorsky, Vladimir Baileys, [[Harald Haarmann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/eeo/Awarisch.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005649/http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/eeo/Awarisch.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Magomedov, Murad Gadjievich|Murad Magomedov]],&lt;ref&gt;(Magomedov, M.G.

The Avar language belongs to the Avar-Andi-Tsez subgroup of the Alarodian Northeast Caucasian (or Nakh–Dagestanian) language family. The writing is based on the [[Cyrillic script]], which replaced the [[Arabic script]] used before 1927 and the [[Latin script]] used between 1927 and 1938. More than 60% of the Avars living in Dagestan speak [[Russian language|Russian]] as their second language.

'''Charles Louis Critchfield''' (June 7, 1910 – February 12, 1994) was an [[Americans|American]] [[mathematical physicist]]. A graduate of [[George Washington University]], where he earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Physics under the direction of [[Edward Teller]] in 1939, he conducted research in [[ballistics]]  at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]] at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], and received three patents for improved [[sabot]] designs.

In 1943, Teller and  [[Robert Oppenheimer]] persuaded Critchfield to come to the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], where he joined the Ordnance Division under [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William Sterling Parsons|William Parsons]] on the [[gun-type fission weapon]]s, [[Little Boy]] and [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]]. After it was discovered that the Thin Man design would not work, he was transferred to [[Robert Bacher]]'s Gadget Division as the leader of the  Initiator group, which was  responsible for the design and testing of the [[Modulated neutron initiator#Urchin|"Urchin" neutron initiator]] that provided the burst of neutrons that kick-started the nuclear detonation of the [[Fat Man]] weapon.

After the war he became a professor at the [[University of Minnesota]], and then  vice president for research at the [[Convair]] division of [[General Dynamics]], where he worked on the [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas family of rockets]]. In 1961, [[J. Carson Mark]] and [[Norris Bradbury]] offered him a position at Los Alamos, which he held until he retired in 1977.

== Early life ==
Charles Louis Critchfield was born in [[Shreve, Ohio]], on June 7, 1910, and grew up in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name='OBIT' /&gt;&lt;ref name='BIRTHPLACE'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.petervogel.us/lastwave/chapters/LastWave_Ch11.pdf | title = Manhattan Project U235 production data, 1943–1945 (See p6) | accessdate = April 18, 2012 | last = Vogel | first = Peter | website = The Last Wave from Port Chicago | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130226013350/http://www.petervogel.us/lastwave/chapters/LastWave_Ch11.pdf | archivedate = February 26, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] (1934) and [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1936) degrees in Mathematics from [[George Washington University]], where he also earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Physics (1939) under the direction of [[Edward Teller]].&lt;ref name='PTOBIT' /&gt;

During Critchfield's graduate studies, Teller's colleague [[George Gamow]]&lt;ref name='GAMOW' /&gt; introduced him to [[Hans Bethe]], with whom he wrote a paper in 1938, which analyzed the [[Nuclear fusion#Astrophysical reaction chains|nuclear fusion]] of [[protons]] into [[deuterons]].&lt;ref name='PTOD' /&gt;  The next year, Bethe showed that this process is a key link in the [[proton-proton chain reaction]] and the [[CNO cycle]], which are the major ways that nuclear energy is released in the [[solar core]] and in massive stars.&lt;ref name='BETHE' /&gt;  In 1967,  Bethe was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] for this work on [[stellar nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name='SCHWEBER' /&gt;

== World War II ==
After he graduated, Critchfield taught optics for a year at the [[University of Rochester]] at the invitation of [[Victor Weisskopf]].&lt;ref name='PTOBIT' /&gt; In 1940, he was awarded a [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] fellowship, and went to work under [[Eugene Wigner]] at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton University|Princeton]].&lt;ref name='IAS' /&gt;  At this time, Robert Kent had just recruited [[John von Neumann]] to the advisory board of the [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]] at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]. Critchfield joined von Neumann and Wigner there on several visits.&lt;ref name='KENT' /&gt;&lt;ref name='ORAL' /&gt;

[[File:Jette Critchfield and Oppenheimer.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Eric Jette]], Charles Critchfield, and [[Robert Oppenheimer]] at Los Alamos]]
In 1942, after a brief stay at [[Harvard University]], Critchfield went to the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution of Washington]], where he continued his ballistic studies, which resulted in three patents for improved [[sabot]] designs.&lt;ref name='PATENTS' /&gt; Because of his experience with [[ballistics]], Teller and  [[Robert Oppenheimer]] persuaded Critchfield to come to the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in 1943,&lt;ref name='LANLBIO' /&gt; where he joined the Ordnance Division under [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William Sterling Parsons|William Parsons]].&lt;ref name='ORAL' /&gt;  As leader of the target, projectile, and source group, he worked on the [[gun-type fission weapon]]s, [[Little Boy]] and [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]].&lt;ref name='GUNS' /&gt;

In April 1944, the Manhattan Project experienced a crisis when [[Emilio Segrè]] discovered that [[plutonium]] made in [[nuclear reactors]] would not work in Thin Man.&lt;ref name='GUNS' /&gt;  In response, Oppenheimer completely reorganized the laboratory to focus on development of an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]] in August.  He reassigned Critchfield to a new Gadget Division under [[Robert Bacher]], as the leader of the  Initiator group.&lt;ref name='PROJECT' /&gt; This group was responsible for the design and testing of the [[Modulated neutron initiator#Urchin|"Urchin" neutron initiator]], which provided a burst of neutrons that kick-started the nuclear detonation of the [[Fat Man]] weapon.&lt;ref name='MEADE' /&gt;

== Postwar ==
Critchfield left Los Alamos in 1946 and returned to George Washington University, but soon left to join Wigner at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].&lt;ref name='PTOBIT' /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPVA" /&gt; In 1947 he became an assistant professor at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he participated, with [[Edward P. Ney]] and [[John R. Winckler]], in a classified project to improve balloon technology.&lt;ref name='FINAL' /&gt; Here, with Leland S. Bohl, he invented and patented the natural shape balloon,&lt;ref name='NATURAL' /&gt; and participated, with Ney and his student Sophie Oleksa, in an early search for primary cosmic ray electrons.&lt;ref name='OLEKSA' /&gt;

In 1955, after advancing to full professor at Minnesota, Critchfield became vice president for research at the [[Convair]] division of [[General Dynamics]].&lt;ref name='ROBERT' /&gt;  Here, he worked on the [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas family of rockets]], which began as a series of [[SM-65 Atlas|ICBMs]] and evolved into launch vehicles for [[Project Mercury]] and [[Atlas-Centaur|many other space missions]].  He also created the Convair Scientific Research Laboratory whose staff were expected to serve as consultants for the company's engineering divisions and to carry out basic scientific research.  In 1957, Critchfield's student William C. Erickson joined the staff, and created the Clark Lake Radio Observatory.&lt;ref name='CLARKLAKE' /&gt;  In 1963, this facility, where observations focused on long wavelength radio waves, was transferred to the [[University of Maryland]], where Erickson had become a professor.  Although the original observatory has been abandoned, similar research continues at the much larger [[Long Wavelength Array]] in central [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name='ARRAY' /&gt;

== Later life ==
In early November 1959, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Neil H. McElroy]] selected Critchfield to be head of the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]]. McElroy hoped that Critchfield would be able to fix the nation's trouble missile program, but Critchfield was reluctant to serve at the director's $19,000 salary. McElroy then offered to let Critchfield serve without pay, with the government paying only his expenses of $15 per day, while allowing Critchfield to continue to draw his Convair salary of around $40,000. Critchfield accepted this offer, but ran into a storm of political and media criticism over the conflict of interest involved in heading an agency that did $4 million worth of business with Convair each year. Critchfield then withdrew his name from consideration.&lt;ref name='TIME1' /&gt;&lt;ref name='TIME2' /&gt;

In 1961, Critchfield accepted a professorship at the [[University of Wisconsin]], but before he moved to Madison, his friends at Los Alamos, [[J. Carson Mark]] and [[Norris Bradbury]] offered him a position there that he took instead.&lt;ref name='ROBERT' /&gt;  He held this position until he retired in 1977, but he continued his association with the laboratory until his death after a long battle with cancer on February 12, 1994.  His obituary in [[Physics Today]] was written by  Carson Mark, [[Louis Rosen]], Edward Teller, and Roger Meade.&lt;ref name='PTOBIT' /&gt;

Charles Critchfield is buried next to his wife, Jean, in Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos County, New Mexico.&lt;ref name='GUAJE' /&gt;

'''Christian Rakovsky''' ({{OldStyleDate|August 13|1873|August 1}} – September 11, 1941) was a [[Bulgaria]]n socialist [[Professional revolutionaries|revolutionary]], a [[Bolshevik]] politician and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] diplomat; he was also noted as a journalist, physician, and essayist. Rakovsky's political career took him throughout the [[Balkans]] and into France and [[Imperial Russia]]; for part of his life, he was also a [[Romania]]n citizen.

A lifelong collaborator of [[Leon Trotsky]], he was a prominent activist of the [[Second International]], involved in politics with the [[Bulgarian Social Democratic Union]], [[Social Democratic Party of Romania (1910-1918)|Romanian Social Democratic Party]], and the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]. Rakovsky was expelled at different times from various countries as a result of his activities, and, during World War I, became a founding member of the [[Balkan Communist Federation|Revolutionary Balkan Social Democratic Labor Federation]] while helping to organize the [[Zimmerwald Conference]]. Imprisoned by Romanian authorities, he made his way to Russia, where he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik Party]] after the [[October Revolution]], and, as head of the ''[[Rumcherod]]'', unsuccessfully attempted to generate a [[communist revolution]] in the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. Subsequently, he was a founding member of the [[Comintern]], served as [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|head of government]] in the [[Ukrainian SSR]], and took part in negotiations at the [[Genoa Conference]].

He came to oppose [[Joseph Stalin]] and rallied with the [[Left Opposition]], being marginalized inside the government and sent as Soviet ambassador to London and Paris, where he was involved in renegotiating financial settlements. He was ultimately recalled from France in autumn 1927, after signing his name to a controversial [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] platform which endorsed [[world revolution]]. Credited with having developed the Trotskyist critique of [[Stalinism]] as "bureaucratic centrism", Rakovsky was subject to internal exile. Submitting to Stalin's leadership in 1934 and being briefly reinstated, he was nonetheless implicated in the [[Case of the Anti-Soviet "Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites"|Trial of the Twenty One]] (part of the [[Moscow Trials]]), imprisoned, and executed by the [[NKVD]] during World War II. He was [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] in 1988, during the Soviet ''[[Glasnost]]'' period.

==Names==
Rakovsky's original [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] name was ''Krastyo Georgiev Stanchev'' (Кръстьо Георгиев Станчев), which he himself changed to ''Krastyo Rakovski'' (Кръстьо Раковски). The usual form his first name took in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] was ''Cristian'' (occasionally rendered as ''Christian''), while his last name was spelled ''Racovski'', ''Racovschi'', or ''Rakovski''. His given name was occasionally rendered as ''Ristache'', an antiquated [[hypocoristic]]—he was known as such to his acquaintance, the writer [[Ion Luca Caragiale]].&lt;ref name="cioculescuristache"&gt;Cioculescu, p.28, 46, 246–248&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russian, his full name, including [[Names in Russian Empire, Soviet Union and CIS countries|patronymic]], was ''Khristian Georgievich Rakovsky'' (Христиан Георгиевич Раковский). ''Christian'' (as well as ''Cristian'' and ''Kristian'') is an approximate rendition of ''Krastyo'' (the Bulgarian for "cross"), as used by Rakovsky himself.&lt;ref name="fagansocleader"&gt;Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], Rakovsky's name is rendered as Християн Георгійович Раковський, and usually [[Romanization of Ukrainian|transliterated]] as ''Khrystyyan Georgiiovych Rakovsky''.

During his lifetime, he was also known under the pseudonyms ''H. Insarov'' and ''Grigoriev'', which he used in signing several articles for the Russian-language press.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"; Trotsky, ''Christian Rakovsky et Basile Kolarov''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Revolutionary beginnings===
Christian Rakovsky was born to a wealthy Bulgarian family in [[Gradets, Sliven Province|Gradets]]—near [[Kotel (Bulgaria)|Kotel]]—at the time still part of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-ruled [[Rumelia]].&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; Rakovsky ("An Autobiography") stated that his birthplace was Kotel&lt;/ref&gt; He was, on his mother's side, the nephew of [[Georgi Sava Rakovski]], a revolutionary hero of the [[Bulgarian National Revival]];&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"; Upson Clark&lt;/ref&gt; that side of his family also included [[Georgi Mamarchev]], who had fought against the Ottomans in the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Imperial Russian Army]].&lt;ref name="rakautob"&gt;Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"&lt;/ref&gt; Rakovsky's father was a merchant who belonged to the [[Democratic Party (Bulgaria)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt;

He later stated that, as early as his childhood years, he had felt a special admiration towards Russia, and that he had been impressed by witnessing, at age 5, the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] and Russian presence (he claimed to have met General [[Eduard Totleben]] during the conflict).&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; Although his parents moved to the [[Kingdom of Romania]] in 1880, settling in [[Pecineaga|Gherengic]] ([[Northern Dobruja]]), he completed his education in newly emancipated Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"; Upson Clark&lt;/ref&gt; Rakovsky was expelled from the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Gabrovo]] for his political activities (in 1887 and then again, after organizing a riot, in 1890).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; It was around that time that he became a [[Marxism|Marxist]], and began collaborating with the socialist journalist [[Evtim Dabev]], whom he aided in printing works by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] (at the time, Rakovsky and [[Sava Balabanov]] also published their own newspaper, the clandestine ''Zerkalo'').&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"&lt;/ref&gt;

Since, after having ultimately been banned from attending any [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] in the country, he could not complete his education in Bulgaria,&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"; Tănase, "Cristian Racovski"&lt;/ref&gt; in September 1890 Rakovsky went to [[Geneva]] to begin his studies and become a physician.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; While in Switzerland, he joined the Socialist Student Circle at the [[University of Geneva]], which was largely composed of non-Swiss youth.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

A [[Multilingual|polyglot]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated257"&gt;Anghel &amp; Iosif, p.257; Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''&lt;/ref&gt; Rakovsky became close to [[Georgy Plekhanov]], the founder of Russian Marxism, and his circle, eventually writing a number of articles and a book in Russian.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; He also briefly worked with [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Pavel Axelrod]] and [[Vera Zasulich]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Unable to attend the First International Congress of Socialist Students in [[Brussels]] (1892), he became involved in organizing the Second Congress, held in Geneva during the fall of 1893.&lt;ref name="fagansocleader"/&gt;

He was a founding editor of the Geneva-based Bulgarian-language magazine ''Sotsial-Demokrat'' and later a major contributor to the Bulgarian Marxist publications ''Den''', ''Rabotnik'', and ''Drugar''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; At the time, Rakovsky and Balabanov, with Plekhanov's encouragement, stressed the importance for moderation in socialist policies—''Sotsial-Demokrat'' rallied with the [[Bulgarian Social Democratic Union]] and rejected the more radical [[Social-Democratic Party of Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name="fagansocleader"/&gt; He soon became involved in distributing socialist propaganda inside Bulgaria, at a time when [[Stefan Stambolov]] organized a crackdown on political opposition.&lt;ref name="fagansocleader"/&gt;

Later in 1893, Rakovsky enrolled in a medical school in Berlin, contributing articles for ''[[Vorwärts]]'' and becoming close to [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] (the two corresponded regularly for the rest of Liebknecht's life).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; As a Bulgarian delegate to the [[Second International]] Congress in [[Zürich]], he also met with Engels and [[Jules Guesde]].&lt;ref name="fagansocleader"/&gt;

Six months later, he was arrested and expelled from the [[German Empire]] for maintaining close contacts with the Russian revolutionaries there.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; He finished his education in 1894–1896 in [[Zürich]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] and [[Montpellier]], where he wrote for ''[[La Jeunesse Socialiste]]'' and ''[[La Petite République]]'', maintaining a friendship with Guesde and becoming an opponent of [[Jean Jaurès]]' [[Reformism|reformist]] views.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"; ''Les socialistes et la guerre''&lt;/ref&gt; According to his own testimony, he became active in supporting the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Anti-Ottoman upsurge]] in [[Crete]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], as well as [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnak]] revolutionary activities.&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; In 1896, he was the Bulgarian representative to the Second International's London Congress (part of his speech was published in [[Karl Kautsky]]'s ''[[Die Neue Zeit]]'').&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

===Military service and first stay in Russia===
Although actively involved in many European countries' socialist movements, prior to 1917 Rakovsky's focus remained on the Balkans and especially on his native country and Romania; his activities in support of the international socialist movement led to his expulsion, at different times, from Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, France and Russia.

In 1897 he published ''Russiya na Istok'' (''Russia in the East''), a book sharply critical of the [[Russian Empire]]'s foreign policy, which, according to Rakovsky, followed one of [[Georgy Plekhanov]]'s guidelines ("Tsarist Russia must be isolated in its foreign relations").&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; On several occasions, he publicly criticized Russia's policies towards Romania and in [[Bessarabia]]&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; Frunză, p.92; Upson Clark&lt;/ref&gt; (describing Russia's rule over the latter as "[[Autocracy|absolutist]] conquest", "mischievous action", and "abduction").&lt;ref&gt;Rakovsky, in Frunză, p.92&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rakovsky, "[[Russophilia|Russophile]] papers" in Bulgaria had begun to target him as a consequence.&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt;

After completing his education as a physician at the [[University of Montpellier]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; Tănase, "Cristian Racovski"&lt;/ref&gt; (with the thesis ''L'Éthiologie du crime et de la dégénérescence'' – "The Cause of Crime and Degeneration", submitted in 1897),&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; Upson Clark&lt;/ref&gt; Rakovsky, who had married the Russian student E. P. Ryabova,&lt;ref name="fagansocleader"/&gt; was summoned to Romania in order to be drafted in the [[Romanian Army]], and served as a [[Combat medic|medic]] in the 9th Cavalry Regiment stationed in [[Constanţa]], [[Dobruja]] (1899–1900).&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; He rose to the rank of lieutenant.&lt;ref name="upsonclark"&gt;Upson Clark&lt;/ref&gt;

Rakovsky subsequently rejoined his wife in [[Saint Petersburg]], where he hoped to settle down and engage in revolutionary activities (he was probably expelled after an initial attempt to enter the country, but was allowed to return).&lt;ref name="upsonclark"/&gt; An adversary of [[Peter Berngardovich Struve]] after the latter moved towards [[market liberalism]],&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; he became acquainted with, among others, [[Nikolay Mikhaylovsky]] and [[Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky]], while authoring articles for ''[[Nashe Slovo]]'' and helping distribute ''[[Iskra]]''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; His close relationship with Plekhanov led Rakovsky to a position between the [[Menshevik]] and [[Bolshevik]] factions of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labor Party]], one he kept from 1903 to 1917; the Bolshevik leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] was initially hostile to Rakovsky,&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; and at one point wrote to [[Karl Radek]] that "we [the Bolsheviks] do not have the same road as his kind of people".&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, in Tănase, "Cristian Racovski"&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Rakovsky was expelled from Russia and had to move back to Paris.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Returning to the Russian capital in 1900, he remained there until 1902, when his wife's death and the crackdown on socialist groups ordered by [[List of Russian rulers|Emperor]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] forced him to return to France.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Working for a while as a physician in the village of [[Beaulieu, Haute-Loire|Beaulieu]], Haute-Loire,&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; he asked French officials to review his case for [[French nationality law|naturalization]], but was refused.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

In 1903, following the death of his father, Rakovsky again lived in Paris, where he followed developments of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and spoke out against Russia, attracting, according to Rakovsky himself, the criticism of both Plekhanov and [[Jules Guesde]].&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; He voiced his opposition to the concession made by [[Karl Kautsky]] to [[Jean Jaurès]], one which had allowed socialists to join "[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]" governments in times of crisis.&lt;ref name="rakguerre"&gt;Rakovsky, ''Les socialistes et la guerre''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''România Muncitoare''===
[[File:JosDespotizmul1905 - MagIstIan1975.jpeg|thumb|251x251px|Front page of ''Jos Despotizmul!..'' ("Down with [[Despotism]]!!!"), a special issue of ''[[România Muncitoare]]'', entirely dedicated to criticism of the [[Imperial Russia]]n authorities (February 1905)]]
He ultimately settled in Romania (1904) having inherited his father's [[Estate (land)|estate]] near [[Mangalia]].&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; Tănase, "Cristian Racovski"; Upson Clark&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, his property, valued at some 40,000 United States dollars at the time,&lt;ref name="upsonclark"/&gt; was home to [[Leon Trotsky]]—when the latter visited the Balkans as a press envoy in the [[Balkan Wars]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; He was usually present in [[Bucharest]] on a weekly basis, and started an intense activity as a journalist, doctor and lawyer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The Balkans correspondent for ''[[L'Humanité]]'',&lt;ref name="fagansocleader"/&gt; he was also personally responsible for reviving ''[[România Muncitoare]]'', the defunct journal of the Romanian socialist group, provoking successful strike actions which brought him to the attention of officials.&lt;ref&gt;''110 ani de social-democraţie'', p.13; Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"; Upson Clark&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Rakovsky also traveled to Bulgaria, where he eventually sided with the ''[[Bulgarian Communist Party|Tesnyatsi]]'' in their conflict with other socialist groups.&lt;ref&gt;Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"; Trotsky, ''Christian Rakovsky et Basile Kolarov''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, he was present at the [[Second International]]'s Congress in [[Amsterdam]], where he gave a speech celebrating the assassination of Russian police chief [[Vyacheslav von Plehve]] by [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] members.&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt;

Rakovsky became noted locally especially after 1905, when he organized rallies in support of the [[Russian battleship Potemkin|Battleship Potemkin revolt]] (the events worsened relations between Russia and the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]),&lt;ref&gt;Anghel &amp; Iosif, p.257; Tismăneanu, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; carried out a relief operation for the ''Potemkin'' crew as their ship sought refuge in [[Constanţa]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated257"/&gt; and attempted to determine them to set sail for [[Batumi]] and aid striking workers there.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; According to his own account, a parallel scandal occurred when an armed Bolshevik ship was captured in Romanian territorial waters; Rakovsky, who indicated that the weapons on board were to be used in Batumi, faced allegations in the Romanian press that he was preparing a [[Dobruja]]n insurrection.&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt;

His head was injured during street clashes with [[Romanian Police|police forces]] over the ''Potemkin'' issue;&lt;ref&gt;Anghel &amp; Iosif, p.257&lt;/ref&gt; while recovering, Rakovsky befriended the Romanian poets [[Ştefan Octavian Iosif]] and [[Dimitrie Anghel]], who were publishing works under a common signature—one of the two authored a sympathetic portrait of the socialist leader, based on his recollections from the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Anghel &amp; Iosif, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout these years, Rakovsky, was, according to Iosif and Anghel, "continuously bustling; disappearing and appearing in workers' centers, be it in [[Brăila]], be it in [[Galaţi]], be it in [[Iaşi]], be it anywhere, always preaching with the same undaunted fervor and fanatical conviction his social credo".&lt;ref&gt;Anghel &amp; Iosif, p.258&lt;/ref&gt;

Rakovsky was drawn into a polemic with the Romanian authorities, facing public accusations that, as a Bulgarian, he lacked patriotism;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; in return, he commented that, if patriotism meant "[[Racism|race prejudice]], international and civil war, political [[tyranny]] and [[Plutocracy|plutocratic]] domination", he refused to be identified with it.&lt;ref&gt;Rakovsky, in Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; in Upson Clark&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the outbreak of [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|Romanian Peasants' Revolt]] of 1907, Rakovsky was especially vocal: he launched accusations at the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] government, arguing that, having profited from the early [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] message of the revolt, it had violently repressed it from the moment peasants began to attack landowners.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Supportive of the thesis according to which the peasantry had revolutionary importance inside Romanian society and Eastern Europe at large,&lt;ref name="fagansocleader"/&gt; Rakovsky publicized his perspective in the socialist press (writing articles on the subject for ''România Muncitoare'', ''L'Humanité'', ''[[Avanti! (Italian newspaper)|Avanti!]]'', ''[[Vorwärts]]'' and others).&lt;ref name="fagansocleader"/&gt; Rakovsky was also one of the journalists suspected of having greatly exaggerated the overall death toll in their accounts: his estimates speak of over 10,000 peasants killed, whereas the government data counted only 421.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Bulei, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/421-nu-11-000-3047758/ "421, nu 11.000"], in [[Ziarul Financiar]]'', February 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He became close to the influential dramatist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], who was living in Berlin at the time.&lt;ref name="cioculescuristache"/&gt; Caragiale authored his own virulent critique of the Romanian state and its handling of the revolt, an essay titled ''1907, din primăvară până în toamnă'' ("1907, From Spring to Autumn"), which, in its final version, adopted some of Rakovsky's suggestions.&lt;ref&gt;Cioculescu, p.28, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

===1907 expulsion===
After repeatedly condemning repression of the revolt, Rakovsky was, together with other socialists, officially accused of having agitated rebellious sentiment, and consequently expelled from Romanian soil (late 1907).&lt;ref&gt;''110 ani de social-democraţie'', p.14; Anghel &amp; Iosif, p.256; Cioculescu, p.146-247; Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; Ornea, p.514; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"; Tănase, "Cristian Racovski"; Upson Clark&lt;/ref&gt; He received news of this action while already abroad, in  [[Stuttgart]] (at the Seventh Congress of the [[Second International]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; Ornea, p.514&lt;/ref&gt; He decided not to recognize it, and contended that his father had settled in [[Northern Dobruja]] before the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] that had awarded the region to Romania;&lt;ref name="upsonclark"/&gt; the plea was rejected by the [[Court of Appeal]], based on evidence that Rakovsky's father was not in Dobruja before 1880, and that Rakovsky himself used a Bulgarian passport when moving across borders.&lt;ref name="upsonclark"/&gt; During the 1920s, Rakovsky was still viewing the incident as a "blatantly illegal act".&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt;

The action itself caused protests from leftist politicians and sympathizers,&lt;ref&gt;Anghel &amp; Iosif, p.256; Cioculescu, p.247&lt;/ref&gt; including, among others, the influential Marxist thinker [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] (whose appeal in favor of Rakovsky was described by Iosif and Anghel as evidence of "an almost parental love").&lt;ref&gt;Anghel &amp; Iosif, p.256&lt;/ref&gt; The local socialists organized several rallies in his support, and the return of his citizenship was also backed by [[Take Ionescu]]'s opposition group, the [[Conservative-Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.514&lt;/ref&gt; In exile, Rakovsky authored the pamphlet ''Les persécutions politiques en Roumanie'' ("Political Persecutions in Romania") and two books (''La Roumanie des boyars'' – "[[Boyar]] Romania", and the since-lost ''From the Kingdom of Arbitrariness and Cowardice'').&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Eventually, he traveled back into Romania in October 1909, only to be arrested upon his transit through [[Brăila County]].&lt;ref&gt;Editor's note in Anghel &amp; Iosif, p.256; Cioculescu, p.247; Ornea, p.514; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"&lt;/ref&gt; According to his recollections, he was for long left stranded on the border with [[Austria-Hungary]], as officials in the latter country refused to let him pass; the situation had to be settled by negotiations between the two countries.&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; Also according to Rakovsky, the arrest was hidden by the [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] cabinet until it leaked to the press—this, coupled with rumors that he was about to be killed, and Brătianu's statement that he would "rather destroy [Rakovsky] than let [him] back into Rumania",&lt;ref&gt;Brătianu, in Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"&lt;/ref&gt; caused a series of important street clashes between his supporters and government forces.&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; On December 9, 1909, a [[Căile Ferate Române|Romanian Railways]] employee named Stoenescu attempted to assassinate Brătianu.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.521-522; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"&lt;/ref&gt; The event, which was attributed by Rakovsky to support for his return&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; and by other sources to government manipulation,&lt;ref name="ornea521522"&gt;Ornea, p.521-522&lt;/ref&gt; caused a clampdown on ''[[România Muncitoare]]'' (among those socialists arrested and interrogated were [[Gheorghe Cristescu]], [[I. C. Frimu]], and [[Dumitru Marinescu]]).&lt;ref name="ornea521522"/&gt;

Rakovsky secretly returned to Romania in 1911, giving himself up in [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; According to Rakovsky, he was again expelled, holding a Romanian passport, to [[Istanbul]], where he was swiftly arrested by the [[Young Turks]] government but released soon after.&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; He subsequently left for [[Sofia]], where he established the Bulgarian socialist journal ''[[Napred (Bulgaria)|Napred]]''.&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; Ultimately, the new [[Petre P. Carp]] [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880-1918)|Conservative]] cabinet agreed to allow his return to Romania, following pressures from the French [[Prime Minister of France|Premier]] [[Georges Clemenceau]] (who answered an appeal by [[Jean Jaurès]]).&lt;ref name="fagansocleader"/&gt; According to Rakovsky, this was also determined by the Conservative change in policies towards the peasantry.&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; He unsuccessfully ran for [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] during the [[Romanian general election, 1911|elections of that year]] (and several others in succession),&lt;ref name="upsonclark"/&gt; being fully reinstated as a citizen in April 1912.&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; Romanian journalist [[Stelian Tănase]] contends that the expulsion had instilled resentment in Rakovsky;&lt;ref name="tanaserako"&gt;Tănase, "Cristian Racovski"&lt;/ref&gt;{{vc|date=September 2016}} earlier, the leading National Liberal politician [[Ion G. Duca]] himself had argued that Rakovsky was developing a "hatred for Romania".&lt;ref&gt;Duca, rendered in Tănase, "Cristian Racovski"&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside [[Mihai Gheorghiu Bujor]] and Frimu, Rakovsky was one of the founders of the [[Social Democratic Party of Romania (1910-1918)|Romanian Social Democratic Party]] (PSDR), serving as its president.&lt;ref&gt;''110 ani de social-democraţie'', p.3&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1912, he helped organize a mourning session for the centennial of Russian rule in Bessarabia, and authored numerous new articles on the matter.&lt;ref name="upsonclark"/&gt; He was afterwards involved in calling for peace during the [[Balkan Wars]];&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; notably, Rakovsky expressed criticism of Romania's invasion of Bulgaria during the [[Second Balkan War]], and called on Romanian authorities not to annex [[Southern Dobruja]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Alongside Frimu, Bujor, [[Ecaterina Arbore]] and others, he lectured at the PSDR's propaganda school during the short period the latter was in existence (in 1910 and again in 1912–1913).&lt;ref&gt;''110 ani de social-democraţie'', p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, Rakovsky was married a second time, to Alexandrina Alexandrescu (also known as Ileana Pralea), a socialist militant and intellectual, who taught mathematics in [[Ploieşti]].&lt;ref name="gb425"&gt;Brătescu, p.425&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandrescu was herself a friend of Dobrogeanu-Gherea and an acquaintance of Caragiale.&lt;ref&gt;Valeria Stan, Florian Tănăsescu, Marian Ştefan, "1871–1971. Am iubit şi am admirat pe cel care se chema I. C. Frimu" ("We Have Loved and Admired the One Named I. C. Frimu"), in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', October 1971, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; She had previously been married to Filip Codreanu, a [[Narodnik]] activist born in Bessarabia, with whom she had a daughter, Elena, and a son, Radu.&lt;ref name="gb425"/&gt;

Rallying with the left wing of international [[social democracy]] during the early stages of World War I, Rakovsky later indicated that he had been purposely informed of the controversial pro-war stance taken by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] by the pro-[[Triple Entente|Entente]] [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Romanian Foreign Minister]] [[Emanuel Porumbaru]].&lt;ref name="faganregroup"&gt;Fagan, ''Regroupment of the socialist movement''&lt;/ref&gt; With staff of the Menshevik paper ''[[Nashe Slovo]]'' (edited by [[Leon Trotsky]]), he was among the most prominent socialist [[Pacifism|pacifists]] of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Regroupment of the socialist movement''; Trotsky, ''Christian Rakovsky et Basile Kolarov''&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting his ideological priorities, ''[[România Muncitoare]]'''s title was changed into ''Jos Răsboiul!'' ("Down with war!")—it was later to be known as ''Lupta Zilnică'' (the "Daily combat").&lt;ref name="faganregroup"/&gt;

Heavily critical of the [[French Socialist Party]]'s decision to join the [[René Viviani]] cabinet (deeming it "an abdication"),&lt;ref name="rakguerre"/&gt; he stressed the responsibility of all European countries in provoking the war,&lt;ref name="rakguerre"/&gt; and adhered to Trotsky's vision of a "Peace without indemnities or annexations" as an alternative to "[[Imperialism|imperialist]] war".&lt;ref name="faganregroup"/&gt; According to Rakovsky, tensions between the French [[Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière|SFIO]] and the German Social Democrats were reflecting not just context, but major ideological differences.&lt;ref&gt;Rakovsky, ''Les socialistes et la guerre''; Trotsky, ''Christian Rakovsky et Basile Kolarov''&lt;/ref&gt;

Present in Italy in March 1915, he attended the [[Milan]] Congress of the [[Italian Socialist Party]], during which he attempted to persuade it to condemn [[Italia irredenta|irredentist goals]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"; Tănase, "Cristian Racovski"&lt;/ref&gt; In July, after convening the Bucharest Conference, he and [[Vasil Kolarov]] established the [[Balkan Communist Federation|Revolutionary Balkan Social Democratic Labor Federation]] (comprising the left-leaning socialist parties of Romania, Bulgaria, [[Serbia]] and Greece), and Rakovsky was elected first secretary of its Central Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Socialist leader in the Balkans''; ''Regroupment of the socialist movement''; Trotsky, ''Christian Rakovsky et Basile Kolarov''; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, together with the Italian Socialist delegates ([[Oddino Morgari]], [[Giacinto Menotti Serrati]], and [[Angelica Balabanoff]] among them), Rakovsky was instrumental in convening the anti-war international socialist [[Zimmerwald Conference]] in September 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Regroupment of the socialist movement''; Tănase, "Cristian Racovski"; Trotsky, ''Christian Rakovsky et Basile Kolarov''&lt;/ref&gt; During the congress, he came into open conflict with Lenin, after the latter voiced the [[Zimmerwald Left]]'s opposition to the resolution (at one point, Rakovsky reportedly lost his temper and grabbed Lenin, causing him to temporarily leave the hall in protest).&lt;ref name="tanaserako"/&gt;{{vc|date=September 2016}} Later, he continued to mediate between Lenin and the Second International, a situation from which emerged a circular letter that complemented the ''Zimmerwald Manifesto'' while being more radical in tone.&lt;ref name="faganregroup"/&gt; In October 1915, he reportedly did not protest [[Bulgaria during World War I|Bulgaria's entry into the war]]&lt;ref name="upsonclark"/&gt;—this information was contradicted by Trotsky, who also indicated that the ''[[Bulgarian Communist Party|Tesniatsy]]'' had been the target of a government crackdown at that exact moment.&lt;ref&gt;Trotsky, ''Christian Rakovsky et Basile Kolarov''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BASA 156-1-57-1 Christian Rakovsky elections Romania-1918.jpg|thumbnail|Advertising, Parliamentary elections, 1916|256x256px]]
Rakovsky ran for Parliament for a final time during 1916, and again lost when contesting a seat in [[Covurlui County]].&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Regroupment of the socialist movement''; Upson Clark&lt;/ref&gt; Again arrested in 1916, after being accused of planning rebellion during a violent incident in [[Galaţi]], he was, according to his own account, freed by a [[general strike]] which constituted "an outburst of indignation among the workers".&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; Evaluating the situation in Romania, he identified the two main pro-Entente political forces of the moment, the groups led by [[Take Ionescu]] and [[Nicolae Filipescu]], with, respectively, "corruption" and "[[Reactionary|reaction]]".&lt;ref name="rakguerre"/&gt;

Suspicions also rose that he had been contacted by German intelligence, that his 1915 trip to Italy had served German interests,&lt;ref name="tanaserako"/&gt;{{vc|date=September 2016}} and that he was being subsidized with German money.&lt;ref&gt;Torrey, p.23, 25&lt;/ref&gt; Rakovsky also drew attention to himself after welcoming to [[Bucharest]] the pro-German maverick socialist [[Alexander Parvus]].&lt;ref name="tanaserako"/&gt;{{vc|date=September 2016}} His independence was consequently challenged by the [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] paper ''[[Adevărul]]'', a former socialist venue, who called Rakovsky "an adventurer without scruples", and viewed him as employed by Parvus and other German socialists.&lt;ref&gt;Torrey, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Rakovsky himself alleged that, "under the mask of independence", ''Adevărul'' and its editor [[Constantin Mille]] were in the pay of Take Ionescu.&lt;ref name="rakguerre"/&gt; After Romania's entry into the conflict on the side of the Entente in August 1916, having failed to attend the [[Kienthal Conference]] due to the closure of borders,&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;Fagan, ''Regroupment of the socialist movement''; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"&lt;/ref&gt; he was placed under surveillance and ultimately imprisoned in September, based on the belief that he was acting as a German [[Espionage|spy]].&lt;ref&gt;''110 ani de social-democraţie'', p.15; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"; Tănase, "Cristian Racovski"&lt;/ref&gt; As Bucharest fell to the [[Central Powers]] during the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|1916 campaign]], he was taken by Romanian authorities to their refuge in Iaşi.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; Held until after the [[February Revolution]], he was freed by the Russian Army on May 1, 1917, and immediately left for [[Odessa]].&lt;ref&gt;''110 ani de social-democraţie'', p.15; Fagan, ''Regroupment of the socialist movement''; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"; Tănase, "Cristian Racovski"; Upson Clark&lt;/ref&gt;

===October Revolution===
Rakovsky moved to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] (the new name of Saint Petersburg) in the spring of 1917.&lt;ref name="faganregroup"/&gt; His anti-war activism almost got him arrested; Rakovsky managed to flee in August, and was present in [[Stockholm]] for the [[Third Zimmerwald Conference]]; he remained there and, with [[Karl Radek]], issued propaganda material in support of the Russian revolutionaries.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; Present in the [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] faction of the Mensheviks, he joined the [[Bolshevik]]s in December 1917 or early 1918, after the [[October Revolution]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; (although he was occasionally listed among the [[Old Bolsheviks]]).&lt;ref name="orwell"&gt;[[George Orwell]], "Arthur Koestler. Essay". Retrieved July 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Rakovsky later stated that he had friendly relations with the Bolsheviks from early autumn 1917, when, during the attempted [[Coup d'état|putsch]] of [[Lavr Kornilov]], he was hidden by these in [[Sestroretsk]].&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt;

His rise in influence and his approval of [[world revolution]] led him to seek Lenin's support for a Bolshevik government over Romania, at a time when a similar attempt was being made by the Odessa-based ''Romanian Social Democratic Action Committee'', under the guidance of [[Mihai Gheorghiu Bujor]];&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; Stelian Tănase claims that during the period, a group of one hundred Russian Bolsheviks had infiltrated [[Iaşi]] with the goal of assassinating [[King of Romania|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] and organizing a coup.&lt;ref name="tanaserako"/&gt;{{vc|date=September 2016}} Eventually, Lenin decided in favor of a unified project, and called on Bujor and Rakovsky to form a single leadership (which also included the Romanian expatriates [[Alecu Constantinescu]] and [[Ion Dic Dicescu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Regroupment of the socialist movement''; Tănase, "Cristian Racovski"&lt;/ref&gt;

As the coup was under preparation in December 1917, Rakovsky was present on the border and waiting a signal to enter the country.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; When Bolsheviks were arrested and the move was overturned, he was probably responsible for ordering the arrest of Romania's representative to Petrograd, [[Constantin I. Diamandy]], and his entire staff (all of whom were used as [[hostage]]s, pending the release of prisoners taken in Iaşi).&lt;ref name="tanaserako"/&gt;{{vc|date=September 2016}} Trotsky, who was by then Russia's [[Narkomindel|People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs]] ([[Foreign Minister of Russia|Foreign Minister]]), called on the Romanian government of [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] to hand in persons captured, indicating that he would otherwise encourage the communist activities of Romanian refugees on Russian soil, and receiving a reply according to which no such arrests had occurred.&lt;ref name="tanaserako"/&gt;{{vc|date=September 2016}}

At the same time, Rakovsky regained Odessa, where he became a leader of the Bolshevik administrative body (''[[Rumcherod]]''), and, according to the claims of Stelian Tănase, ordered violent reprisals to be aimed at Romanian nationals present in the city, and issued [[agitprop]] literature in [[Romanian language|Romanian]].&lt;ref&gt;Tănase, "Cristian Racovski"; Upson Clark&lt;/ref&gt;{{vc|date=September 2016}}

As Russia negotiated the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] with Germany, he ordered ''Rumcherod'' troops to march towards Romania, which was by then giving in to the German advances and preparing to sign its own peace.&lt;ref name="tanaserako"/&gt;{{vc|date=September 2016}} Initially stalled by a much-criticized temporary [[armistice]] with [[Romanian Army]] leader [[Alexandru Averescu]], Rakovsky ordered a fresh offensive in [[Moldavia]], but had to retreat when the [[Central Powers]], confronted with Trotsky's refusal to accept their version of a Russo-German peace, began their own military operation and occupied Odessa (setting free Romanians who had been imprisoned there).&lt;ref name="tanaserako"/&gt; On March 9, 1918, Rakovsky signed a treaty with Romania regarding the evacuation of troops from Bessarabia, which Stelian Tănase claims allowed for the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] to join Romania. In May, Romania conceded to the demands of the Central Powers (''see [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918]]'').&lt;ref name="tanaserako"/&gt;{{vc|date=September 2016}}[[File:Rakovsky Ukraine 1920.jpg|thumb|Christian Rakovsky in Ukraine 1920|225x225px]]In April–May 1918, he negotiated with the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] [[Tsentral'na Rada]], then with the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]] of [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]], as well as with German forces (''see [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution]]'').&lt;ref name="autogenerated1923"&gt;Fagan, ''Soviet Diplomat (1923–7)''; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Rakovsky left for Austria (where the [[First Austrian Republic|First Republic]] had been proclaimed), being received by [[Foreign Minister of Austria|Foreign Minister]] [[Victor Adler]] (a member of [[Karl Renner]]'s [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] cabinet).&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; Rakovsky's real goal was to reach Germany and negotiate the situation in Ukraine, but he was expelled upon arrival to that country.&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt;

Escorted, together with [[Adolph Joffe]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], to the German-aligned [[Belarusian National Republic]], he caught news of the [[German Revolution|collapse of the German Empire]] and was selected as a delegate to the German [[workers' council]]s.&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt; He and all other envoys were arrested by German soldiers in [[Kaunas]], and sent to [[Minsk]], then to [[Homyel]], before making their way to Moscow.&lt;ref name="rakautob"/&gt;

===Second Ukrainian government===
{{See also|People's Secretariat}}
After the subsequent Soviet offensive in [[Ukraine]], Lenin appointed Rakovsky  as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Ukraine|Chairman of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Workers and Peasants of Ukraine]], replacing [[Georgy Pyatakov]] on January 16, 1919 due to the latter's argument with [[Fyodor Sergeyev]] for excessive interference in Ukrainian affairs. On March 29, 1919 the government was reorganized as the [[Council of People's Commissars (Ukraine)|Soviet of the People's Commissars]].&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Rakovsky and the Ukraine (1919–23)''; Rakovsky, "An Autobiography"&lt;/ref&gt; According to the British author [[Arthur Ransome]], present in Moscow during early that year, "It had been found that the views of the Pyatakov government were further left than those of its supporters, and so Pyatakov had given way to Rakovsky who was better able to conduct a more moderate policy".&lt;ref name="ransome"&gt;[[Arthur Ransome]], [http://home.freeuk.com/russica2/books/1919/1919.html ''Russia in 1919'']. Retrieved July 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While in office, Rakovsky totally ignored Ukrainian issues, considering Ukraine and its language merely "an invention" of intellectuals.&lt;ref name="faganrakukr"&gt;Fagan, ''Rakovsky and the Ukraine (1919–23)''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Rakovsky assessed the situation created by the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and advised his superiors to build warm relations with both [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]]'s Turkey and the [[Weimar Republic]], as a camp of countries dissatisfied with policies of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]].&lt;ref name="fagansovdipl"&gt;Fagan, ''Soviet Diplomat (1923–7)''&lt;/ref&gt; Rakovsky subscribed to the Bolshevik condemnation of [[Greater Romania]], stance that journalist Victor Frunză considered a revision of his previous views on Bessarabia.&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.93; Livezeanu, p.250; Tismăneanu, p.44-45; Upson Clark&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the Romanian delegation attributed the shortage in supply in Bessarabia and [[Transylvania]] a Bolshevik [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] centered on Rakovsky;&lt;ref name="livezeanu250"&gt;Livezeanu, p.250&lt;/ref&gt; various French reports of the time gave contradictory assessments (while some credited Rakovsky with direct influence on Soviet foreign policy, others dismissed the notion that Russia had any such projects).&lt;ref name="livezeanu250"/&gt;
[[File:Christian Rakovsky 1923.jpg|left|thumb|Christian Rakovsky 1923, First Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars (Prime Minister) of the Ukrainian SSR.|241x241px]]
Rakovsky simultaneously served as Soviet Ukraine's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and a member of the South West Front's Revolutionary Military Council, contributing to the defeat of the [[White movement|White Army]] and Ukrainian nationalists during the [[Russian Civil War]], while theorizing that "Ukraine was a laboratory of [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalism]]" and "a decisive factor in world revolution".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1919"&gt;Rakovsky, in Fagan, ''Rakovsky and the Ukraine (1919–23)''&lt;/ref&gt; Rakovsky's presence was also decisive in rallying the dissident [[Borotbists]] to the Bolshevik faction's central bodies—he was subsequently confronted with a degree of Borotbist opposition inside his government.&lt;ref name="faganrakukr"/&gt; According to American politologist [[Jerry F. Hough]], his appointment and policies were evidence of [[Russification]], a program requested by Lenin himself; Rakovsky's view contrasted with that supported by Stalin, who, at the time, was calling for increased [[Ukrainianization]].&lt;ref name="hough"&gt;[[Jerry F. Hough]], ''Democratization and Revolution in the USSR, 1985–1991'', [[Brookings Institution|Brookings Institution Press]], Washington, D.C., 1997, p.223-224. {{ISBN|978-0-8157-3749-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 February 1919 at the session of Kiev city council Rakovsky as a head of Ukrainian government stated following: "Decreeing the [[Ukrainian language]] as a state language is reactionary and unnecessary".&lt;ref&gt;Mirchuk, P. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20141217113633/http://donklass.com/arhiv/histdisk/exlibris/insurgent/narys_oun/soviet.html Outline of the history of OUN]''. Vol.1. Munich-London-New-York: "Ukrayinske vydavnytstvo", 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 1919, Christian Rakovsky was one of the founding members of the [[Comintern]], where he represented the [[Balkan Communist Federation]].&lt;ref name="ransome"/&gt; During those months, when control over the entire Ukraine was made possible by the offensive against [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] forces, he expressed his support for the [[Dnipropetrovsk|Yekaterinoslav]] wing of the [[Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine|Ukrainian Communist Party]]—following its wishes, he subordinated the Ukrainian Communists to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party]] and argued that a separate [[Central Committee]] was "luxury" for such a small grouping.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1919"/&gt;

In summer, as Rakovsky's government briefly lost control of Ukraine, his policies became hotly contested by partisans of Ukrainian autonomy inside the Party, who held a conference in Homyel (one which Rakovsky did not attend).&lt;ref name="faganrakukr"/&gt; At the Fourth Congress of the Ukrainian Party (March 1920), the leadership of Rakovsky, [[Stanislav Kosior]], and [[Dmitry Manuilsky]] was not reelected.&lt;ref name="faganrakukr"/&gt; Attacks on them caused problems with the Russian Party; as Lenin himself sided with Rakovsky, a delegation comprising Trotsky, [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Adolph Joffe]] left for [[Kiev]] to discuss the matter with local leaders.&lt;ref name="faganrakukr"/&gt; In order to curb the crisis, the Ukrainian Party was subjected to a major purge, during which pro-autonomy opposition was removed from its ranks and the former leaders were reinstated.&lt;ref name="faganrakukr"/&gt;

At the time, Rakovsky and [[Georgy Chicherin]] received harsh criticism from the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] communist leaders [[Béla Kun]], for allegedly refusing aid to the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] and thus contributing to its fall.&lt;ref name="debo"&gt;Richard Kent Debo, ''Survival and Consolidation: the Foreign Policy of Soviet Russia, 1918–1921'', [[McGill-Queen's University Press]], [[Montreal]], 1992, p.117. {{ISBN|978-0-7735-0828-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appears not to have been true, as Rakovsky reportedly urged Lenin to finance the Kun even as the latter faced the intervention of troops from both Romania and [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="debo"/&gt; Lenin wrote back to Kun informing him that the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] was satisfied with the way in which Rakovsky and Chicherin had carried out their mission.&lt;ref name="debo"/&gt;[[File:PBW June 1920.png|thumb|235x235px|[[Polish-Soviet War in 1920|1920 theater of war]]: farthest advances of [[Second Polish Republic|Polish]] and [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] forces during the [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|Kiev Offensive]]]]

===Reinstating of Soviet dominance and international conferences===

After dealing with the common offensive of the Directorate and [[Second Polish Republic|Polish]] forces—the [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|Kiev Offensive]] (''see [[Polish-Soviet War in 1920]]'')—, Rakovsky's government took measures regarding [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]]; according to his biographer Gus Fagan, he became himself a proponent of greater Ukrainian autonomy, and advocated both Ukrainization through the complete integration of [[Borotbists]] into Party structures and a slower pace in [[communization]].&lt;ref name="faganrakukr"/&gt; He notably came into conflict with the Russian Party after his second executive had its independent Commissariat of Foreign Trade replaced with an office under the control of central authorities.&lt;ref name="faganrakukr"/&gt; He continued to pressure for a measure of independence in Ukrainian economy, and, during the early 1920s, the republic sealed its own trade agreements with other European countries.&lt;ref name="faganrakukr"/&gt;

Rakovsky remained a Romanian citizen for the entire period. In 1921, he was officially summoned to be tried by a [[court-martial]] for "crime against the security of the Romanian state".&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.93&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Death sentence|sentenced to death]] ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' (1924). Journalist Victor Frunză claims this move had been prompted by a supposed similar verdict given by a Soviet Court to [[Ion Inculeţ]] (who had led the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]]'s [[Sfatul Ţării|Legislative Assembly]] that voted union with Romania).&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.95&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Socialist Party of Romania]] delegation ([[Gheorghe Cristescu]], [[Eugen Rozvan]], [[David Fabian]], [[Constantin Popovici (politician)|Constantin Popovici]], [[Ioan Flueraş]], and [[Alexandru Dobrogeanu-Gherea]]) voted to adhere to the Comintern, Rakovsky and [[Grigory Zinoviev]] pressured the group to expel those of its members who supported Greater Romania (including Flueraş and Popovici, as well as [[Iosif Jumanca]] and [[Leon Ghelerter]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p.45-47&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ramsay MacDonald Christian Rakovsky 1924.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ramsay MacDonald]], Prime Minister UK and Christian Rakovsky, Head of the Soviet diplomatic delegation.|248x248px]]
In February 1922, he was sent to Berlin in order to negotiate with German officials, and, in March, was part of the official delegation to the [[Genoa Conference]]—under the leadership of [[Georgy Chicherin]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1923"/&gt; Rakovsky himself was virulently opposed to any stalemate with the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], and urged his delegation not to abandon policies over promises of deescalation and trade.&lt;ref name="fagansovdipl"/&gt; A leader of the delegation's commissions on [[economic aid]], loans and [[government debt]],&lt;ref name="fagansovdipl"/&gt; he was also charged with renewing contacts with Germany—together with [[Adolph Joffe]], he discussed the matter with the pro-Soviet [[Ago von Maltzan]], and, as Russia failed to reach an agreement with the Allies, managed to obtain from Germany promises of cooperation (''see [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922]]'').&lt;ref name="fagansovdipl"/&gt; Two years later, when captured by the Bolsheviks, [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Eser]] conspirator [[Boris Savinkov]] allegedly confessed that he intended to have both Rakovsky and Chicherin killed in Berlin, as they returned from [[Genoa]].&lt;ref&gt;"Battle for Life", in ''Time'', September 8, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1922, Rakovsky attended the [[Conference of Lausanne]], where he was confronted with the assassination of his fellow diplomat [[V. V. Vorovsky|Vaslav Vorovsky]] by the ''[[White Emigre|émigré]]'' [[Maurice Conradi]].&lt;ref name="fagansovdipl"/&gt;

As the Soviet Union was being created, Rakovsky became opposed to the new central leadership over the issue of [[self-determination]] for the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] and [[Autonomous republics of the Soviet Union|autonomous republics]]. This followed the dispute between, on one side, [[Joseph Stalin]], Zinoviev, Totsky and Kamenev, and, on the other, the leadership of the [[Georgian SSR]] (''see [[Georgian Affair]]'').&lt;ref name="fagansovdipl"/&gt; At the time, he evidenced a "permanent struggle which the so-called independent and autonomous republics had to carry out to safeguard not only their prerogatives but their very own existence".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1919"/&gt; Arguing in favor of extending the revolution from Ukraine to the [[Balkans]], and indicating his belief that the peasantry was being alienated by [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] messages, Rakovsky cited concerns that [[Centralized government|centralism]] was placing Soviet influence in peril, and called for "carrying out a correct theoretical and practical solution to the national question within the boundaries of the Soviet Union".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1919"/&gt; In November 1922, he successfully proposed the formation of a [[Soviet of Nationalities]] to double the [[Soviet of the Union]] inside the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|supreme legislative body]];&lt;ref name="faganrakukr"/&gt; his arguments in favor of reducing the number of representatives of [[Russian SFSR]] and barring the total number of envoys from any republic at one fifth of the total were dismissed after being criticized by Stalin.&lt;ref name="faganrakukr"/&gt;

===Trotskyist opposition and ambassadorship===
After Lenin's illness and incapacitation, Rakovsky joined Leon Trotsky's [[Left Opposition]] and came into conflict with Stalin.&lt;ref name="fagansovdipl"/&gt; Although declining, his influence in Ukraine was, according to political scientist John P. Willerton, one of Trotsky's main bases of support, alongside sections of the [[Red Army]], a group of [[Komsomol]] leaders, and various officials involved in [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economic planning]].&lt;ref&gt;John P. Willerton, ''Patronage and Politics in the USSR'', [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Cambridge]], 1992, p.28. {{ISBN|978-0-521-39288-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early July 1923, after being isolated inside the Ukrainian leadership, he was removed from his Ukrainian post, replaced with [[Vlas Chubar]], and sent to London to negotiate a formal recognition of the Soviet regime by the British and French governments.&lt;ref name="fagansovdipl"/&gt; Chubar, an [[Ukrainians|ethnic Ukrainian]], came to represent Stalin's view on nationality issues in the region, officially defined as "nativization".&lt;ref name="hough"/&gt; In London, Rakovsky and his wife were joined by Elena Codreanu, whom they had adopted.&lt;ref name="gb425"/&gt;

In 1924, as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[minority cabinet]] came to power, [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and Rakovsky negotiated ''[[de jure]]'' recognition and agreed on possible future Anglo-Soviet treaty and a British loan for the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1923"/&gt; Negotiations were tested by the so-called ''Bankers' Memorandum'', published by ''[[The Times]]'', which demanded that the Soviet Union abandon [[nationalization]]s and return to [[private property]].&lt;ref name="fagansovdipl"/&gt; Eventually, two treaties were signed, allowing for commerce to be normalized between the two countries, and reflecting Rakovsky's views that private complaints of creditors against the Soviet state were to be settled outside the conference.&lt;ref name="fagansovdipl"/&gt; The scandal which erupted when the ''[[Zinoviev Letter]]'' was publicized, rekindling suspicions against the Soviet government and provoking the fall of MacDonald's cabinet, brought an end to all further talks; during and after the incident, Rakovsky repeatedly cited evidence that the ''Letter'' was a forgery.&lt;ref name="fagansovdipl"/&gt;

In parallel, he had begun negotiations with France's [[Raymond Poincaré]], who aimed for a "solidarity of foreign creditors" in respect to the Soviet state,&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré, in Fagan, ''Soviet Diplomat (1923–7)''&lt;/ref&gt; and who agreed to recognize the latter on October 28, 1924.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1923"/&gt; One of his last tasks involved placing Soviet orders for machinery, textiles, and other commodities with British manufacturers: worth 75 million US$ on paper, these failed to attract attention after he announced that the Soviet government did not intend to pay in cash.&lt;ref&gt;"Notes", in ''Time'', July 27, 1925&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American magazine ''Time'', Rakovsky also played a hand in motivating Stalin's decision to marginalize Comintern leader Zinoviev, by complaining that the latter's foreign policy was needlessly radical.&lt;ref&gt;"The Little Corporal", in ''Time'', May 18, 1925&lt;/ref&gt;

Rakovsky served as the [[List of Ambassadors of Russia to France|Soviet ambassador to France]] between October 1925 and October 1927, replacing [[Leonid Krasin]]. He did not take hold of his office until 50 days after his official appointment, refusing to be received at the [[Élysée Palace]] by [[President of France|French President]] [[Gaston Doumergue]] for as long as the state authorities would not allow ''[[The Internationale]]'' (a revolutionary song which was at the time the Soviet [[national anthem]]) to be played on the occasion.&lt;ref name="timebugle"&gt;"Bugle Blast", in ''Time'', December 21, 1925&lt;/ref&gt; Doumergeue resisted, and, in the end, Rakovsky was received to the sound of an improvised arrangement of [[Bugle (instrument)|bugles]], the more discreet part of which may have been based on ''The Internationale''.&lt;ref name="timebugle"/&gt; ''Time'' described it as a "deafening blast".&lt;ref name="timebugle"/&gt;

His first task involved renewed negotiations with the cabinet of [[Aristide Briand]] (February 1926), during which he was confronted with the vocal campaign of creditors.&lt;ref name="fagansovdipl"/&gt; Early results achieved in discussions with [[Anatole de Monzie]] were dismissed by the opposition rallied around Poincaré, and, after being revived by the short-lived cabinet of [[Édouard Herriot]], talks ended without any result.&lt;ref&gt;"Faux Pas", in ''Time'', March 22, 1926; Fagan, ''Soviet Diplomat (1923–7)''&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré returned to power, and France remained committed to the [[Locarno Treaties]] (which had isolated the Soviet state on the international stage).&lt;ref name="fagansovdipl"/&gt; Over the following year, Christian Rakovsky continued to attempt a ''[[détente]]'' with France, advertising Soviet concessions and speaking directly to the public.&lt;ref name="fagansovdipl"/&gt;

During the same period, as tensions grew between [[Mexico]] and the Soviet government over the latter's support for a Mexican railway workers' strike, American agents reported that Rakovsky was instructed to threaten with publicizing correspondence between former [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Álvaro Obregón]] and Soviet authorities (which had occurred before diplomatic links were established).&lt;ref name="spensermexico"&gt;Daniela Spenser, ''Impossible Triangle: Mexico, Soviet Russia, and the United States in the 1920s'', [[Duke University Press]], [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], 1999, p.105-106. {{ISBN|978-0-8223-2289-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this could endanger Mexico's relations with the United States, President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] chose to deescalate the conflict.&lt;ref name="spensermexico"/&gt;

[[File:Rappoport, Rakovski, Krassine et Voline 1924, Meurisse.jpg|thumb|239x239px|Rakovsky with [[Leonid Krasin]] and [[Charles Rappoport]], Paris, 1924]]
Together with his second wife, Rakovsky gave full approval to [[Max Eastman]]'s volume ''Since Lenin Died'', which centered on heavy criticism of Soviet realities, and which they reviewed before it was published.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Draper]], ''American Communism and Soviet Russia'', Transaction Publishers, [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], 2003, p. 360. {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0531-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became acquainted with the former [[French Communist Party]] member and anti-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] journalist [[Boris Souvarine]], as well as with the Romanian writer [[Panait Istrati]], who had observed Rakovsky's career ever since his presence in Romania.&lt;ref name="tanaserenegade"&gt;Tănase, "The Renegade Istrati"&lt;/ref&gt; He also maintained friendly contacts with [[Marcel Pauker]], a prominent but independent-minded member of the [[Romanian Communist Party]], whose activities were denounced by the Comintern in 1930.&lt;ref name="levypauker"&gt;Robert Levy, ''Ana Pauker: The Rise and Fall of a Jewish Communist'', [[University of California Press]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], 2001, p.64-66. {{ISBN|978-0-520-22395-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rakovsky was eventually declared a ''[[persona non grata]]'' in France and recalled after signing the ''Declaration of the Opposition'', a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] platform deemed unfriendly by the French government (it stressed support for revolutions and [[Mutiny|mutinies]] in all capitalist countries).&lt;ref&gt;"Rakovsky's Recall", in ''Time'', October 17, 1927; Fagan, ''Soviet Diplomat (1923–7)''; Tănase, "The Renegade Istrati"&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Time'', France's decision was tacitly welcomed by Foreign Affairs Commissar [[Georgy Chicherin]], due to Rakovsky's political opinions.&lt;ref name="timesneaked"&gt;"Sneaked Away", in ''Time'', October 31, 1927&lt;/ref&gt; Rakovsky left without presenting his letter of recall to President Doumergue, although he was scheduled for a meeting at the Élysée.&lt;ref name="timesneaked"/&gt; He was initially scheduled to serve as Ambassador to Japan.&lt;ref name="timesneaked"/&gt; On his trip back to the Soviet state, he was joined by Istrati, who, partly owing to his witnessing of the Rakovsky's downfall, soon became a noted opponent of Stalinism.&lt;ref name="tanaserenegade"/&gt;

===Persecution and internal exile===
In December, Rakovsky and [[Lev Kamenev]] held brief speeches in front of the [[15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|Soviet Communist Party's Fifteenth Congress]].&lt;ref name="siegelbaum"&gt;Lewis H. Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918–1929'', [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Cambridge]], 1992, p.189-190. {{ISBN|978-0-521-36987-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former was interrupted fifty-seven times by his opponents—[[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Martemyan Ryutin]], and [[Lazar Kaganovich]].&lt;ref name="siegelbaum"/&gt; Although, unlike Rakovsky, he used the occasion to appeal for reconciliation, Kamenev was himself interrupted twenty-four times by the same group.&lt;ref name="siegelbaum"/&gt;

]]
After that moment, although branded "[[enemy of the people]]", Rakovsky was still occasionally allowed to speak in public (notably, together with Kamenev and [[Karl Radek]], to the Moscow [[Komsomol]]), and continued to criticize Stalin's leadership as "bureaucratic socialism" (''see [[Bureaucratic collectivism]]'') and "[[Social fascism theory|social fascism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Opposition and Exile''; [[Victor Kravchenko (defector)|Victor Kravchenko]], ''I Chose Freedom'', Transaction Publishers, [[Somerset, New Jersey]], 1988, p.51-52. {{ISBN|978-0-88738-754-8}}; Tismăneanu, p.61-62&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Nikolai Krestinsky]] (who split with the group soon afterwards) and Kamenev, he attempted to organize a substantial opposition, visiting Ukraine for this purpose, hosting public meetings and printing [[manifesto]]s addressed to the workers in [[Kiev]], [[Kharkiv]], [[Mykolaiv]], [[Odessa]], [[Dnipropetrovsk]], [[Kherson]], and [[Zaporizhia]] (he was assisted by, among others, [[Yuri Kotsubinsky]]).&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"&gt;Fagan, ''Opposition and Exile''&lt;/ref&gt; He was persistently [[Heckler|heckled]] during public appearances, and his supporters were beaten up by the ''[[Militsiya]]''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;Fagan, ''Opposition and Exile''; Tănase, "The Renegade Istrati"&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1927, after receiving news that [[Adolph Joffe]] had committed suicide, he assigned Ukrainian campaigning to [[Voja Vujović]], and returned to Moscow.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; Following the defeat of the Left Opposition in November–December 1927, Rakovsky was ousted from the [[Comintern]], the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]], and eventually from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Opposition and Exile''; Medvedev, p.60; Tănase, "The Renegade Istrati"&lt;/ref&gt; He was exiled, first to [[Astrakhan]], [[Saratov]], and then to [[Barnaul]].&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Opposition and Exile''; Tănase, "The Renegade Istrati"; Tismăneanu, p.61-62&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the decision, he commented to his visitor, French writer [[Pierre Naville]]: "The French expelled me from Paris for having signed a declaration of the opposition. Stalin expelled me from the [Foreign Affairs Commissariat]&lt;!-- note that this is not a missing link: the brackets replace the Russian term used in the original translation, for clarity --&gt; for having signed the same declaration. But in both cases they let me keep the jacket".&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;Rakovsky, in Fagan, ''Opposition and Exile''&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Astrakhan, Rakovsky was employed by the Regional [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Planning Committee]] (''Gubplan'').&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"/&gt; He was also active as a writer, starting work on a volume detailing the sources of [[Utopian socialism]] and the thought of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]].&lt;ref&gt;Rakovsky, in Fagan, ''Opposition and Exile''; Tănase, "The Renegade Istrati"&lt;/ref&gt; Rakovsky remained involved in Trotskyist politics, was contacted by [[Panait Istrati]] and the [[Greece|Greek]] writer [[Nikos Kazantzakis]],&lt;ref name="tanaserenegade"/&gt; and corresponded with Trotsky (who had himself been exiled to [[Almaty]]).&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; Most of his writings were confiscated by the [[State Political Directorate]], but the letter on Soviet "bureaucratism" he addressed to [[Nikolai Valentinov]] survived, and became notorious as a critique of Stalinism (under the title ''"Professional Dangers" of Power'').&lt;ref&gt;Rakovsky, in Fagan, ''Opposition and Exile''; Tismăneanu, p.61-62&lt;/ref&gt; Mistrusting Stalin's new leftist policies, he foresaw the renewed moves against the Left Opposition (inaugurated by Trotsky's 1929 expulsion).&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

As his health deteriorated, he was allowed to move to Saratov upon requests addressed by Krestinsky to Kaganovich, the Secretary of the Central Committee.&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"/&gt; He was visited by [[Louis Fischer]], who recorded Rakovsky's determination not to submit to Stalin (contrasting his option with those of Radek, [[Yevgeni Preobrazhensky]], [[Alexander Beloborodov]] and [[Ivar Smilga]]).&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"/&gt; Instead, Rakovsky incited further resistance to Stalinism, and issued a declaration of the united opposition; following this, he was sent to Barnaul, which he called a "hole in the barren cold ground".&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; In another critical letter to the Party leadership (April 1930), he called for, among other things, the restoration of [[civil liberties]], a reduction in the party apparatus, the return of Trotsky, and an end to forced [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]].&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"/&gt;

Little is known of Rakovsky's life between that moment and July 1932, the moment when he was allowed a medical leave.&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"/&gt; Towards the end of the same year, Trotsky was informed that he had attempted to flee the Soviet Union, and, in March 1933, it was announced that he had been deported to [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]].&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"/&gt; Answering Trotsky's request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist [[Jean Van Heijenoort]], together with his fellow activist [[Pierre Frank]], unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author [[Maxim Gorky]] to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name="yedlin"&gt;Tova Yedlin, ''Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography'', Praeger/Greenwood, [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], 1992, p.201-202. {{ISBN|978-0-275-96605-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Heijenoort, they only managed to meet Gorky's son, Maxim Peshkov, who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed, but promised to pass on their request.&lt;ref name="yedlin"/&gt; Researcher Tova Yedlin proposed that the problem was caused by Gorky's distress over having recently separated from his mistress [[Moura Budberg]], as well as to the writer's close surveillance by [[State Political Directorate|OGPU]] agents.&lt;ref name="yedlin"/&gt;

===Submission to Stalin and the Show Trial===
Rakovsky was one of the last leading Trotskyists to break with Trotsky and surrender to Stalin. Alarmed by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power in Germany and under intense pressure from Stalin, he announced his submission to the Party through a telegram he sent ''[[Izvestia]]'' (February 23, 1934).&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"/&gt; While Rakovsky was allowed to return to Moscow,&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"/&gt; Trotsky declared the dissociation statement to be "purely formal".&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"&gt;Trotsky, in Fagan, ''Opposition and Exile''&lt;/ref&gt;

Rakovsky formally "admitted his mistakes" in April 1934 (his letter to the ''[[Pravda]]'', titled ''There Should Be No Mercy'', depicted Trotsky and his supporters as "agents of the German [[Gestapo]]").&lt;ref&gt;Medvedev, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed to high office in the Commissariat for Health and allowed to return to Moscow,&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"/&gt; also serving as Soviet ambassador to Japan in 1935.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;Feofanov &amp; Barry, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

Cited in allegations involving the killing of [[Sergey Kirov]], Rakovsky was arrested in autumn 1937, during the [[Great Purge]];&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"/&gt; according to Trotsky, he was forced to wait without food or rest for 18 hours, during which time his house was being searched.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

Shortly thereafter, in March 1938, he was put on trial along with [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Alexei Rykov]], [[Genrikh Yagoda]], [[Nikolai Krestinsky]] and other [[Old Bolsheviks]], on charges of conspiring with Trotsky to overthrow Stalin, the third [[Show trial|Moscow Show Trial]]—known as the [[Case of the Anti-Soviet "Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites"|Trial of the Twenty One]].&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Opposition and Exile''; Medvedev, p.169, 175–176, 186; Tismăneanu, p.50, 74&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[forced confession]] to [[Andrey Vyshinsky]], he admitted to all the charges—including having been a spy (for Japan)&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; and a landowner.&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"/&gt; He made attempts to point out that his revenue had been used to support socialism, and that he had a grasp of "revolutionary practices", but was attacked by Vyshinsky, who persistently referred to Rakovsky as "a [[counterrevolutionary]]".&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"/&gt; In his final statement, Rakovsky argued: "from my young days I honestly, truthfully and devotedly performed my duty as a soldier of the cause of the emancipation of labor. After this bright period a dark period set in, the period of my criminal deeds".&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

Unlike most of his co-defendants, who were immediately executed, he was sentenced to twenty years of hard labor.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, ''Opposition and Exile''; Medvedev, p.178&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 he was in [[Oryol Prison]]. After the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] invasion of the Soviet Union ([[Operation Barbarossa]]), Rakovsky was shot on Stalin's orders outside [[Oryol]]&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"/&gt;—along with [[Olga Kameneva]], [[Maria Spiridonova]] and over 150 other political prisoners in the [[Medvedev Forest massacre]]. This execution was one of the many [[NKVD massacres of prisoners|massacres of prisoners]] committed by the [[NKVD]] in 1941.

==Legacy and rehabilitation==
Rakovsky's second wife, Alexandrina Alexandrescu, was herself arrested, and is known to have been held in [[Butyrka prison]], where she suffered a series of [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]].&lt;ref name="faganoppexile"/&gt; His adoptive daughter, Elena Codreanu-Racovski, was expelled from her job as secretary of the Mossoviet Theater, and deported to [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p.425-426&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to Moscow in the 1950s, after Stalin's death, and settled in [[Communist Romania]] after 1975, rejoining her brother, the biologist and academic Radu Codreanu.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p.426&lt;/ref&gt; She later authored a memoir which included recollections of her father (it was published in Romanian as ''De-a lungul şi de-a latul secolului'', "The Length and Breadth of the Century").&lt;ref name="tanaserenegade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gb4267"&gt;Brătescu, p.426-427&lt;/ref&gt; It was compiled from personal notes and dialogs with physician and former communist militant [[G. Brătescu]], who noted that, probably owing to suspicions she had in respect to the Romanian communist regime, Elena Codreanu refused to talk about Rakovsky's trial and her own persecution.&lt;ref name="gb4267"/&gt; Rakovsky's nephew [[Boris Stefanov]], whom he encouraged to join the Romanian socialist movement before World War I, later became a general secretary of the [[Romanian Communist Party]], before being himself purged in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Ilarion Ţiu,  "Aliatul lui Stalin" ("Stalin's Ally"), in ''[[Jurnalul Naţional]]'', June 7, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1932, Rakovsky's name was frequently invoked in the heated debate involving [[Panait Istrati]] and his political adversaries. Istrati, having returned to Romania in disillusion over Soviet realities, was initially attacked in the local right-wing newspapers ''[[Curentul]]'' and ''[[Universul]]''; writing for the former, [[Pamfil Şeicaru]] defined Istrati as "the servant of Racovski".&lt;ref&gt;Şeicaru, in Tănase, "The Renegade Istrati"&lt;/ref&gt; Having published ''To the Other Flame'', in which he exposed [[Stalinism]], he consequently became the target of intense criticism and allegations from various pro-Soviet writers, led by the Frenchman [[Henri Barbusse]].&lt;ref name="tanaserenegade"/&gt; During this period, the Romanian communist writer [[Alexandru Sahia]] speculated, among other things, that Istrati had been in the pay of Rakovsky and Trotsky for a sizable part of his life.&lt;ref name="tanaserenegade"/&gt;

Based on his independent opinions and, in part, on his friendship with Rakovsky, [[Marcel Pauker]] was disavowed by the Romanian and Soviet communist parties, and was himself a victim of the [[Great Purge]] in 1938.&lt;ref name="levypauker"/&gt; At various intervals between 1930 and 1952, his wife, the Romanian communist leader [[Ana Pauker]], faced pressures to denounce her husband.&lt;ref name="levypauker"/&gt; She allegedly refused to criticize him for anything other than his association with Rakovsky, and to admit that Marcel Pauker had been guilty of all the charges brought against him.&lt;ref name="levypauker"/&gt;

The Hungarian-born author [[Arthur Koestler]], himself a former communist, based Rubashov, the main character in his 1940 novel ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'', on victims of the [[Moscow Trials]]; according to [[George Orwell]], Rakovsky's fate was a possible direct influence: "Rubashov might be called Trotsky, Bukharin, Rakovsky or some other relatively civilised figure among the [[Old Bolsheviks]]. If one writes about the Moscow trials one must answer the question, «Why did the accused confess?» and which answer one makes is a political decision. Koestler answers, in effect, «Because these people had been rotted by the Revolution which they served», and in doing so he comes near to claiming that revolutions are of their nature bad".&lt;ref name="orwell"/&gt;

In 1988, during ''[[Glasnost]]'', the Soviet government cleared Rakovsky and his co-defendants of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;Feofanov &amp; Barry, p.34; Shapiro&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitation]] came in February, coinciding with that of Bukharin, as well as with those of Ukrainian official and former People's Commissar for Agriculture [[Mikhail Alexandrovich Chernov]], former People's Commissar for Foreign Trade [[Arkady Rosengolts]], and other five officials.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taubman, "50 Years After His Execution, Soviet Panel Clears Bukharin", in ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 6, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Bukharin, Rakovsky, Rozengolts, and Chernov were posthumously reinstated to the Communist Party on June 21, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taubman, "Bukharin Status in Party Restored", in ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 10, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; His works were given ''[[imprimatur]]'', while a favorable biography was published by the [[National Academy of Science of Ukraine|Ukrainian Academy of Sciences]] (late 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constantin A. Mimi''' (10 March 1868 – 17 April 1935) was a [[Bessarabia]]n politician and [[winemaker]], whose family was originally from Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Constantin Mimi – viaţă consacrată Basarabiei|url=http://archiva.flux.md/editii/200993/articole/8132/#|accessdate=1 October 2016|agency=FLUX|issue=November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

He graduated from [[Odessa State University]] and [[SupAgro]] ([[Montpellier]]).

When the [[February Revolution]] happened in [[Petrograd]] in 1917, the governor of [[Bessarabia Governorate]] stepped down and passed his legal powers to Constantin Mimi, the President of the [[Gubernial Zemstvo]], which was named ''the Commissar of the Provisional Government in Bessarabia'', with [[Vladimir Criste]] his deputy. Similar procedures took place in all regions of the [[Russian Empire]]: the chiefs of the Tsarist administrations passed their legal powers to the chiefs of the County and Governorate Zemstvos, which were then called ''County/Governorate Commissars''.&lt;ref name="Ion Nistor, p. 279"&gt;[[Ion Nistor]], p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

On {{OldStyleDate|20 July|1917|2 July}}, Constantin Mimi, the official Commissar of the [[Russian Provisional Government]] (of [[Kerenski]]) in Chişinău, gathered delegates of all major political, national, professional and administrative organizations to a "delegation" to protest and reject the pretensions of the ''[[Ukrainian Central Rada]]'' to annex Bessarabia.

The Peasants Congress, which took place in October 1917, voted Constantin Mimi out and [[Ion Inculeţ]] as the new Commissar. This move was planned by [[Alexander Kerenski]], who sent Inculeţ, an associate professor at the [[University of Petrograd]], to Bessarabia to take hold of the situation. As soon as the Peasants Congress, which had no legal power, voted, Kerenski formally replaced Mimi with Inculeţ.

After the [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania]], Constantin Mimi moved to [[Bucharest]] and became the director of the [[National Bank of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timpul.md/articol/iurie-colesnic-un-administrator-cu-vocaie-de-vinificator-49651.html Un administrator cu vocatie de vinificator] {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contactees''' are persons who claim to have experienced contact with [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]]. Some claimed ongoing encounters, while others claimed to have had as few as a single encounter. Evidence is anecdotal in all cases.

As a cultural phenomenon, contactees perhaps had their greatest notoriety from the late 1940s to the late 1950s, but individuals continue to make similar claims in the present. Some have shared their messages with small groups of followers, and many have issued newsletters or spoken at [[UFO convention]]s.

The contactee movement has seen serious attention from academics and mainstream scholars. Among the earliest was the classic 1956 study, ''[[When Prophecy Fails]]'' by [[Leon Festinger]], Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter, which analyzed the phenomenon. There have been at least two university-level anthologies of scientific papers regarding the contactee movements (see sources below).

Contactee accounts are generally different from those who allege [[alien abduction]], in that while contactees usually describe beneficial experiences involving human-like aliens, abductees rarely describe their experiences positively.

==Overview==
Astronomer [[J. Allen Hynek]] described contactees as asserting "the visitation to the earth of generally benign beings whose ostensible purpose is to communicate (generally to a relatively few selected and favored persons &amp;mdash;) messages of 'cosmic importance'. These chosen recipients generally have repeated contact experiences, involving additional messages...."&lt;ref name="hynek"&gt;Hynek, J. Allen (1972). ''The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry'', p. 5. Henry Regnery Company. {{ISBN|978-0-8092-9130-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contactees became a cultural phenomenon in the 1940s and continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s, often giving lectures and writing books about their experience. The phenomenon still exists today. Skeptics hold that such 'contactees' are deluded or dishonest in their claims. [[Susan Clancy]] wrote that such claims are "false memories" concocted out of a "blend of fantasy-proneness, memory distortion, culturally available scripts, sleep hallucinations, and scientific illiteracy".&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, Susan (2005). ''Abducted'', Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|0-674-01879-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contactees usually portrayed "[[Space Brothers (aliens)|Space Brothers]]" as more or less identical in appearance and mannerisms to [[humans]]. The Brothers are also almost invariably reported as disturbed by the violence, crime and wars that infest the earth, and by the possession of various earth nations of nuclear and [[thermonuclear weapons]].
[[Curtis Peebles]] summarizes the common features of many contactee claims:&lt;ref&gt;Peebles, Curtis (1994). ''Watch the Skies: A Chronicle of the Flying Saucer Myth'', pp. 93–108. Smithsonian Institution, {{ISBN|1-56098-343-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Certain humans have had personal or mental contact with friendly, completely human-appearing space aliens.
* The contactees have also flown aboard flying saucers, and traveled into [[outer space|space]] and to other planets.
* The Space Brothers want to help mankind solve its problems, to stop [[nuclear testing]] and prevent the otherwise inevitable destruction of the human race.
* This will be accomplished very simply by the brotherhood spreading a message of love and brotherhood across the world.
* Other sinister beings, the [[Men in Black]], use threats and force to continue the cover-up of UFOs and suppress the message of hope.

==History of contactees==

===Early contactees===
Though the word ''contactee'' was not in common use until the 1950s, the authors of the anthologies noted in "sources" below use the term to describe persons whose claims occurred centuries before the UFO era, attempting to depict them as a part of the same tradition.

Though not linked to flying saucers or odd aerial lights, it is perhaps worth noting that there is a long history of claims of contact with non-earthly intelligences. The founding revelations of many of the world's religions involve contact between the founder and a supernatural source of wisdom, such as a god in human form or an [[angel]]. In this context, it might be expected that most of the 1950s contactees would form their own religions, with the contactee as sole spiritual leader, and that is just what happened, almost invariably.

As early as the 18th century, people like [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] were claiming to be in psychic contact with inhabitants of other planets. 1758 saw the publication of ''Concerning Earths in the Solar System'', in which Swedenborg detailed his alleged journeys to the inhabited planets. [[J. Gordon Melton]] notes that Swedenborg's planetary tour stops at Saturn, the furthest planet known during Swedenborg's era &amp;mdash; he did not visit Uranus, Neptune or Pluto.&lt;ref name="melton"&gt;Melton, Gordon J., "The Contactees: A Survey". In Levin, ed. (1995) ''The Gods Have Landed: New Religions From Other Worlds'', pp. 1–13. Albany: University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-2330-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, [[Helena Blavatsky]] would make claims similar to Swedenborg's.

In 1891, Thomas Blott's book ''The Man From Mars'' was published. The author claimed to have met a Martian in Kentucky. Unusually for an early contactee, Blott reported that the Martian communicated not via [[telepathy]], but in English.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early contactee book, of sorts, was ''From India To The Planet Mars'' (1900) by [[Theodore Flournoy]]. Flournoy detailed the claims of Helene Smith, who, whilst in a trance, dictated information gleaned from her psychic visits to the planet Mars &amp;mdash; including a Martian [[alphabet]] and [[language]] she could write and speak. Flournoy determined that Smith's claims were spurious, based on fantasy and imagination. Her "Martian" language was simply [[glossolalia|a garbled version of French]].

===1900s===
Two of the earliest contactees in the modern sense were William Magoon and [[Guy Ballard]] (the latter a follower of [[Madame Blavatsky]]).

Magoon's book ''William Magoon: Psychic and Healer'' was published in 1930. He claimed that, in the early 20th century, he had been unexpectedly and instantaneously transported to Mars. The planet was essentially earth-like, with cities and wilderness. The inhabitants had radio and automobiles. Though they were [[invisibility|invisible]], Magoon sensed their presences.

Though Magoon was obscure, Ballard would have more impact via the [["I AM" Activity|I Am]] movement he established. In 1935, Ballard claimed that, several years earlier, he and over 100 others witnessed the appearance of 12 Venusians in a cavern beneath [[Mount Shasta]]. The Venusians played music for the audience, said Ballard, then showed the crowd a large [[mirror]]-like device that displayed images of life on Venus. The Venusians then allegedly reported that the earth would suffer through an era of tension and warfare, followed by worldwide peace and goodwill.

[[George Adamski]], who later became probably the most prominent contactee of the UFO era, was one contactee with an earlier interest in the occult. Adamski founded the Royal Order of Tibet in the 1930s. Writes Michael Barkun, "His [later] messages from the Venusians sounded suspiciously like his own earlier occult teachings."&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, Michael (2003). ''A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America''. Los Angeles: University of California Press, Berkeley. {{ISBN|0-520-23805-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Partridge]] notes, importantly, that the pre-1947 contactees "do not involve UFOs".&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher. "Understanding UFO Religions and Abduction Spiritualities". In Partridge, Christopher (2003) ed. ''UFO Religions'' (2003), p. 8. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-26323-9}},&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, he suggests that an existing tradition of extraterrestrial contact via [[seance]]s and psychic means promptly incorporated the flying-saucer mythos when it arrived.

===Contactees in the UFO era===
The 1947 report of [[Kenneth Arnold]] sparked widespread interest in flying saucers, and before long, people were claiming to have been in contact with flying saucer inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

There was a nearly-continuous series of contactees, beginning with [[George Adamski]] in 1952. Radio host [[John Nebel]] interviewed many contactees on his program during this era. The stereotypical contactee account in these days involved not just conversations with friendly, human-appearing spacemen but visits inside their flying saucers, and rides to large "Mother Ships" in Earth orbit, and even jaunts to the Moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In support of their claims, early 1950s contactees often produced photographs of the alleged flying saucers or their occupants. A number of photos of a "Venusian scout ship" by [[George Adamski]] and identified by him as a typical extraterrestrial flying saucer were noted to bear a suspicious resemblance to a type of once commonly available chicken egg incubator, complete with three light bulbs which Adamski said were "landing gear".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://webspace.utexas.edu/cokerwr/www/index.html/adamski.htm| accessdate=2010-09-18| title=Profiles in Pseudoscience: George Adamski!| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927185040/https://webspace.utexas.edu/cokerwr/www/index.html/adamski.htm| archivedate=2011-09-27| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over two decades, contactee [[George Van Tassel]] hosted the annual "Giant Rock Interplanetary Spacecraft Convention" in the [[Mojave Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/118_rock.shtml Article]''Fortean Times Magazine'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405091500/http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/118_rock.shtml |date=April 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 1950s contactee, [[Buck Nelson]], held a similar convention in the Ozarks of Missouri up until 1965.

==Response to contactee claims==
Even in [[ufology]]—itself subject to at best very limited and sporadic mainstream scientific or [[academic]] interest—contactees were generally seen as the [[wikt:lunatic fringe|lunatic fringe]], and "serious" ufologists subsequently avoided the subject, for fear it would harm their attempts at "serious" study of the UFO phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Sheaffer, Robert (1986). ''The UFO Verdict: Examining the Evidence'', p. 18. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|0-87975-338-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheaffer, Robert (1998). ''UFO Sightings: The Evidence'', pp. 34–35. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-213-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Vallée]] notes, "No serious investigator has ever been very worried by the claims of the 'contactees'."&lt;ref&gt;Vallee, Jacques (1965). ''Anatomy of a Phenomenon: Unidentified Objects in Space, A Scientific Appraisal'', p.90. Henry Regnery Company. {{ISBN|0-8092-9888-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Sagan]] has expressed skepticism about contactees and alien contact in general, remarking that aliens seem very happy to answer vague questions but when confronted with specific, technical questions they are silent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Occasionally, by the way, I get a letter from someone who is in "contact" with an extraterrestrial who invites me to "ask anything". And so I have a list of questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I ask things like, "Please give a short proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]." Or the [[Goldbach Conjecture]]. And then I have to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. I never get an answer. On the other hand, if I ask something like "Should we humans be good?" I always get an answer. I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but anything specific, where there is a chance to find out if they actually know anything, there is only silence.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Sagan, [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/burden_of_skepticism/ The Burden of Skepticism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some time after the phenomenon had waned, [[Temple University]] historian [[David M. Jacobs]] noted a few interesting facts: the accounts of the prominent contactees grew ever more elaborate, and as new claimants gained notoriety, they typically backdated their first encounter, claiming it occurred earlier than anyone else's. Jacobs speculates that this was an attempt to gain a degree of "authenticity" to trump other contactees.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, David M. (1975). ''The UFO Controversy In America''. Indiana University Press. {{ISBN|0-253-19006-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young adult, she became close to British actress [[Margaret Rutherford|Dame Margaret Rutherford]], whom she considered an adoptive mother and who was the subject of a biography Simmons wrote in later years.&lt;ref name="rutherford"&gt;{{cite book |title=Margaret Rutherford: A blithe spirit |last=Langley Simmons |first=Dawn |year=1983 |publisher=Barker |isbn=0-213-16890-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5YkAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=margaret+rutherford+a+blithe+spirit&amp;client=safari|accessdate=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[sex reassignment surgery]] in 1968, Simmons wed in the first legal [[interracial marriage]] in South Carolina.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt;

== Early life ==
Simmons's parents were servants at [[Sissinghurst Castle]], the English estate of biographer [[Harold Nicolson]] and his novelist wife, [[Vita Sackville-West]].&lt;ref name="LIES"&gt;{{cite book |title=Peninsula of Lies: A True Story of Mysterious Birth and Taboo Love |last=Ball |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Ball (American author)|author2= |year=2004 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location= |isbn=0-7432-3560-6|page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4SQZSZXq1gC&amp;dq=%22dawn+langley+simmons%22+sissinghurst+-owl&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 |accessdate=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simmons was born in Sussex as Gordon Langley Hall to Jack Copper, Vita Sackville-West's chauffeur, and another servant, Marjorie Hall Ticehurst, before they were married.&lt;ref name="LIES"/&gt; Although she claimed to have been born with an unusual condition that resulted in the swelling of her genitals with the result that she was mistakenly identified as a boy, Charleston author Edward Ball's book ''Peninsula of Lies'' (2004) states that she was born male.&lt;ref name="argus"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/6711048.The_tale_of_the_sex_change_boy_who_had_a_baby/| work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]]| location=[[Brighton and Hove]]| title=The tale of the sex-change boy who had a baby| date=5 October 2004| accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Simmons was raised by her grandmother and at one point visited the castle and met [[Virginia Woolf]], Sackville-West's lover.&lt;ref name="LIES"/&gt; Woolf made Sackville-West the subject of the novel ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'', which bears a striking resemblance to Simmons' own life story.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt;

== Early career ==

In 1946 Simmons emigrated to Canada.&lt;ref name=DUKE/&gt; Still living as a man, she crewcut her hair and became a teacher on the [[Ojibway]] native reservation on [[Lake Nipigon]], experiences from which were translated into the best-selling ''Me Papoose Sitter'' (1955)—the first of many published books.&lt;ref name="LIES"/&gt;

After a stint as an editor for the ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'',&lt;ref name="NYTIMES" /&gt; Simmons moved back to England in 1947, to teach theatre at the Gregg School in Croydon, Surrey.&lt;ref name="DUKE"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/simmonsdawnlangley/ |title=Inventory of the Dawn Langley Simmons Papers |publisher=Rubenstein Rare Book and Manuscript Library, [[Duke University]] |accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to the United States in 1950, and became the society editor for the ''Nevada Daily Mail'' in Missouri before moving to New York and working as the society editor of the ''Port Chester Daily Item''.&lt;ref name="DUKE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt; Shortly after moving to New York, Simmons met artist [[Isabel Whitney]], beginning a friendship that would last until Whitney's death in 1962.&lt;ref name="DUKE"/&gt;

During this time, Simmons began a prolific writing career, including a series of biographies which covered personalities such as [[Princess Margaret]] (1958), [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] (1964), [[Lady Bird Johnson]] (1967), and [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] (1970) among many more.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt; While living in Whitney's New York townhouse in the 1950s, Simmons was introduced to Margaret Rutherford and her husband [[Stringer Davis]]. Rutherford, interested in meeting Simmons to discuss a role in a possible adaptation of ''Me Papoose Sitter'', became enamored with the young author and she and Davis agreed to serve as unofficial adoptive parents.&lt;ref name="LIES"/&gt; Subsequently, Simmons and Whitney purchased a house in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], though Whitney would die two weeks later,&lt;ref name="DUKE"/&gt; leaving Simmons the house and $2 million.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt;

==Move to South Carolina==
The mansion Simmons purchased with Whitney, was located in the [[Ansonborough]] neighbourhood of Charleston, a neighbourhood known for housing the city's queer elite.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LIES"/&gt; Simmons began restoring the house, and designed the interior with early American antiques and furniture by [[Thomas Chippendale]].&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt; Her pursuit of Chippendale pieces brought her into contact with [[Edward Ball (American author)|Edward Ball]], a journalist who owned a Chippendale commode and who would later write a biography about her.&lt;ref name="LIES"/&gt;

In her autobiographical books, Simmons said she was born [[intersex]] with [[ambiguous genitalia]], as well as an internal uterus and ovaries, and was inappropriately assigned male at birth.&lt;ref name="LIES"/&gt; Simmons underwent [[sex reassignment surgery]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in 1968, carried out by Dr. Milton Edgerton.&lt;ref name="LIES"/&gt; In Ball's ''Peninsula of Lies'', he disputes Simmons claim that she was intersex, suggesting instead that Simmons had male genitalia and was unable to bear children.&lt;ref name="LIES"/&gt;

== Marriage ==
Simmons legally changed her name to Dawn Pepita Langley Hall, and became engaged to John-Paul Simmons, then a young black motor mechanic with dreams of becoming a sculptor.&lt;ref name="LIES"/&gt; Their marriage on 21 January 1969 was the first legal [[interracial marriage]] in South Carolina,&lt;ref name="DUKE"/&gt; and the ceremony was carried out in their drawing room reportedly after threats to bomb the church.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt; After a second ceremony in England, the crate containing their wedding gifts was firebombed in Charleston, and Simmons received a ticket the next day when the charred remains were obstructing a sidewalk.&lt;ref name="LETTER"&gt;{{cite news |first=Dawn |last=Langley Simmons |authorlink= |author2= |title=Waging Justice in Charleston |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/07/books/l-waging-justice-in-charleston-437888.html |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |date=7 February 1988 |accessdate=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 1971, her daughter, Natasha Margienell Manigault Paul Simmons, was born, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="LIES"/&gt; Ball claims to have been told by John-Paul Simmons that Natasha was his child from another relationship, although "Natasha fervently believed Dawn was her mother".

After an intruder raped Simmons and broke her arm, the family moved to [[Catskill (town), New York|Catskill, New York]].&lt;ref name="LIES"/&gt;

==Later years and death==
In 1982, she divorced John-Paul Simmons,&lt;ref name="DUKE"/&gt; who had been abusive and suffered from schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="LIES"/&gt; After spending several years in Hudson, New York, she moved in with her daughter and three grandchildren, who had returned to Charleston.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt; In 1985, while back in Charleston, Simmons was featured as an extra in several scenes of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] [[miniseries]] ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North and South]]''.&lt;ref name="LIES"/&gt;

In her final years, Simmons developed [[Parkinson's disease]], and died at her daughter's home on 18 September 2000.&lt;ref name="NYTIMES"/&gt;&lt;!-- moved Withnail &amp; I claim up in chronology --&gt;

==In culture==
In the 1987 film ''[[Withnail and I]]'', set in 1969, the character Marwood reads a tabloid newspaper article about Gordon Langley Hall, entitled "I Had to Become a Woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

==Life==

Dugald Clerk was born in [[Glasgow]] on 31 March 1854, the son of Donald Clerk a machinist and his wife, Martha Symington. He was privately tutored then apprenticed to the firm of Messrs H O Robinson &amp; Co in Glasgow. From 1871 to 1876 he went to Anderson College in Glasgow studying engineering then to the Yorkshire College of Science in [[Leeds]]. In the [[First World War]] he was Director of Engineering Research for the Admiralty.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Margaret Hanney in 1883.

He died in [[Ewhurst, Surrey]] on 12 November 1932.

== Clerk's work on the internal combustion engine ==
[[File:Two-stroke vee-twin engine with pumping cylinders (section).jpg|thumb|Sir Dugald Clerk's two-cycle engine ]]
Clerk began work on his own engine designs in October 1878 after modifying a Brayton engine with a spark plug. [[George Brayton]]. Brayton engines ( called "Ready Motors" were made from 1872 - 1876) and were one of the first engines to successfully use compression and combust fuel in the cylinder. Prior to this time the commercial engines available had been the [[Étienne Lenoir|Lenoir]] engine from 1860, a non - compression engine which worked on a double-acting two-stroke cycle, but spent half of each stroke drawing gas into the cylinder. The Hugon engine was a slightly improved version, but both were quite inefficient (95 and 85 cubic feet of gas per HP hour respectively). The next commercial engine available (from 1867) was the [[Otto engine|Otto &amp; Langen]] a non compression, free piston engine, which used atmospheric pressure for the power stroke, and consumed about half the gas of the Lenoir and Hugon engines. It was in May 1876 that Otto developed his engine using the single-acting four-stroke cycle with compression in the cylinder. Clerk decided to develop an engine using compression, but with the two-stroke cycle, as he could see benefit to weight and smoothness of operation through having twice as many power strokes.

Clerk's initial experiment with a Brayton ready motor in 1878 led him to make improvements that would eventually result in the development of the two-stroke cycle.  Clerks engine used compression and a novel system of ignition", one of these was exhibited in July 1879. However it was not until the end of 1880 that he succeeded in producing the Clerk engine operating on the two-stroke cycle, which became the commercial product. Clerk states "The Clerk engine at present in the market was the first to succeed in introducing compression of this type, combined with ignition at every revolution ; many attempts had previously been made by other inventors, including Mr. Otto and the Messrs. Crossley, but all had failed in producing a marketable engine. It is only recently that the Messrs. Crossley have made the [[Otto engine]] in its twin form and so succeeded in getting impulse at every turn."

Dugald Clerk was the author of 3 comprehensive books covering the development of the oil and gas engine from its early inception, and including details of his own work in this area. The first edition was produced in 1886, and the notes here are taken from the 7th edition,&lt;ref name="Gas&amp;Oil"&gt;Dugald Clerk, "Gas and Oil Engines", Longman Green &amp; Co, 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; revised and updated up to 1896.
In "Gas and Oil Engines",&lt;ref name="Gas&amp;Oil"/&gt; Clerk refers to the significant earlier gas engine patents of [[William Barnett (engineer)|Barnett]] in 1838 and [[Lemuel Wellman Wright|Wright]] in 1833.

== Clerk cycle ==
In 1878 Clerk obtained a Brayton "Ready Motor" engine made from 1872-1876 by [[George Brayton]] in Philadelphia PA USA.  Clerk wondered if he could improve the performance of the engine. He soon outfitted the engine with a spark plug and an improved fuel system. Initially Clerk used one cylinder for compression and the other for expansion. At one point an explosion occurred which broke the engine in two pieces. The engine was repaired and displayed in 1879. Later Clerk decided to abandon use of the pumping cylinder for compression and use it only to transfer the air / fuel mixture into the power cylinder.

[[File:Clerk on Brayton engine.jpg|thumb|Clerk describes his experiments with the Brayton engine 1878]]

 The [[Otto cycle]] was patented in 1876, immediately recognised to have a significant practical value.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; Clerk quickly followed with his concept of a two-stroke engine of 1880, that would not infringe the Otto's patent (being a [[four-stroke]] engine).&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

Clerk describes a Cambell engine as using his cycle, as follows:&lt;ref name="Gas&amp;Oil"/&gt; "It has two cylinders, respectively pump and motor, driven from cranks placed at almost right angles to each other, the pump crank leading. The pump takes in a charge of gas and air, and the motor piston overruns a port in the side of the cylinder at the out-end of its stroke to discharge the exhaust gases. When the pressure in the motor cylinder has fallen to atmosphere, the pump forces its charge into the back cover of the motor cylinder through a check valve, displacing before it the products of combustion through an exhaust port ; the motor piston then returns, compressing the contents of the cylinder into the compression space. The charge is then fired and the piston performs its working stroke. This is the Clerk cycle."

The Clerk engine uses automatic 'poppet' type valves for inlet air and gas (one with spring assistance, one without), and a port in the cylinder uncovered by the piston for the exhaust valve. References to a Clerk engine with slide valve may refer to the earlier experiments with a [[Étienne Lenoir|Lenoir]] type engine. The ignition is by carrying an external flame, using a modification of a method he developed in 1878.

Most engine designs that pre-dated the Otto engine (and Clerk engine), such as those of [[De Rivaz engine|de Rivaz]], the [[Pyréolophore|Niépce brothers]], [[Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir]], [[Samuel Morey]], and others, did use two-stroke engines, which were "natural" in the times of [[steam engine]]. Clerk's significant contribution was introducing Otto-styled compression to the two-stroke engine, bringing its efficiency up-to-date (for the 1880s). Several manufacturers adopted the Clerk cycle in the short term, though commercial aspects such as patents on the four-stroke cycle were part of this. Many years later the [[Two-stroke diesel engine|two-stroke engine]] for large capacity diesels using a [[turbocharger]] or [[supercharger]] has become common, for example in ships and railway locomotives. With open crankshafts, and the advantages of higher power to weight ratio, these engines are closely aligned with Dugald Clerk's concepts, and the Clerk Cycle.

=== Pumping cylinder vs supercharger ===
Clerk's engine was made of two cylinders – one working cylinder and an additional cylinder to charge the cylinder, expelling the exhaust through a port uncovered by the piston. Some sources consider this additional cylinder the world's first&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the History of Technology.|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-203-19211-7|pages=315–321|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fj96Dpp3-5gC&amp;lpg=PA315&amp;dq=rateau%20engine&amp;pg=PA315#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=Ian McNeil}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[supercharger]]. Clerk himself states that "It is not a compressing
pump, and is not intended to compress before introduction into the motor, but merely to exercise force enough to pass the gases through the lift valve into the motor cylinder, and there displace the burnt gases, discharging them into the exhaust pipe." Hence sources recognise it instead as a "pumping cylinder", pointing out that it did not actually compress the fuel-air mixture, it simply moved the fresh mixture to the working cylinder to force out the gasses burnt previously.&lt;ref name=n/&gt;&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

===Clerk's engine vs modern two-stroke engine===
Clerk's original design did not allow the construction of smaller engines, as it required the aforementioned additional pumping cylinder for each working cylinder.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref name=n/&gt; The crucial simplification of the concept, that made possible small yet powerful two-stroke engines for mass markets, was patented by [[Joseph Day (inventor)|Joseph Day]]&lt;ref name=n/&gt; in 1894.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

'''Francis Vyvyan Jago Arundell''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FSA}} (1780–1846) was an English antiquary, Anglican clergyman and oriental traveller.

==Biography==
Arundell was born at [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]], [[Cornwall]], in July 1780, being the only son of Thomas Jago, a solicitor in that town, who had married Catherine, a daughter of Mr. Bolt, a surgeon at Launceston. Francis was educated at [[Liskeard Grammar School]] and at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], where he took the degree of M.A. in 1809, and after having been ordained in the Church of England he took a curacy at [[Antony, Cornwall|Antony]] in his native county.{{sfn|Courtney|1885|p=143}}

From youth to old age Arundell was imbued with a love of antiquarian study, and after his institution in 1805 to the rectory of [[Landulph]] on the banks of the [[River Tamar|Tamar]], he threw himself with avidity into the history of Cornwall. When [[Nicholas Condy]], an artist at Plymouth, published a series of views of [[Cotehele]], the ancient seat of [[Lord Mount Edgcumbe]], Arundell supplied the description of the house which accompanied them. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1811,{{sfn|Courtney|1885|p=143}} but removed from the fellowship in 1845, for being 28 years behind in his subscription.{{sfn|Courtney|North|2004}}

In the church of Landulph is a brass to the memory of [[Theodoro Palaeologus]], descended from the last of the Byzantine emperors, who died on 21 January 1637, and an account of this inscription, and of the person whom it commemorated, was printed by Jago in the volume of the ''[[Archæologia (London)|Archæologia]]'' for 1817, and reprinted in [[Davies Gilbert]]'s ''Cornwall'' (iii, 365). This paper was afterwards amplified into ''Some Notice of the Church of Landulph,'' which was published in 1840, and a reprint of which, with additions by Joseph Polsue of Bodmin, was announced some years ago (i.e. before 1885).

===Oriental journeys===
One of Arundell's ancestors married a co-heiress of John Arundell of Trevarnoe, and Jago assumed that name in addition to his own on 25 February 1815. Next year (17 October) he married Anna Maria, second daughter of Isaac Morier, consul-general at [[Constantinople]], and sister of [[James Morier]], the author of ''Hajji Baba''.{{sfn|Courtney|1885|p=143}}

After this marriage, Arundell turned his thoughts towards the East, and became in 1822 the [[chaplain to the British factory at Smyrna]], where he remained for fourteen years. With characteristic energy he began, very soon after settling at Smyrna, to arrange a tour of exploration in [[Asia Minor]]. The months from March to September 1826 were spent in a pilgrimage to the [[seven churches of Asia]] and an excursion into [[Pisidia]], a narrative of which was issued in 1828. This book was very favourably received.{{sfn|Courtney|1885|p=143}}

Encouraged by his published success, Arundell ventured in 1833 upon another tour of 1,000 miles through districts the greater part of which had hitherto not been described by any European traveller, when he made an especial study of the ruins of [[Antioch in Pisidia]]. Two volumes describing these discoveries were published in 1834. Although he made a third tour in 1835 and 1836 through Palestine, no account of his travels was published.{{sfn|Courtney|1885|p=144}}

Whilst residing at Smyrna, Arundell made large collections of antiquities, coins, and manuscripts; on his return to England the coins were sold to the [[British Museum]]. He gave great assistance to the brothers [[Daniel Lysons (antiquarian)|Lysons]] in their history of Cornwall, and at one time contemplated the publication of a history of that county on his own account. It has even been said that some plates were engraved for it. The materials which he collected for histories of Smyrna and of his native town of [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]] were never used, and are probably lost. He died at Landulph on 5 December 1846, and was buried in its church, not far from the tomb of [[Palæologus]]. His widow died in Osnaburgh Street, London, on 2 June 1869, aged 80.{{sfn|Courtney|1885|p=144}}

The '''gas leak phone call scam''' was a series of incidents in 2016. The incidents involve a person [[prank call]]ing a restaurant, claiming to be a fire department official and then convincing managers to break all the windows to prevent a [[gas explosion]] occurring due a supposed [[gas leak]]. The calls have been most often placed at [[fast food restaurant]]s in the [[United States]].

==Incidents==
A caller who identifies themselves as a [[firefighter]] or other [[authority figure]] contacts a manager or supervisor and would solicit their help in combating a gas leak at the restaurant by breaking all the windows causing thousands of dollars in damages to the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Yanan|last=Wang|title=A weird hoax prompts fast food workers in 3 states to suddenly smash restaurant windows|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/04/11/a-caller-tells-minn-fast-food-workers-break-the-windows-of-your-restaurant-right-now/|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 11, 2016|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harley D. Rutledge''' (January 10, 1926 – June 5, 2006) was a [[United States of America|U.S.]] [[physics]] [[professor]], and [[ufology|ufologist]].

== Early life and career ==
In 1966, Rutledge completed his [[Ph.D.]] in [[solid state physics]] at the [[University of Missouri]]. He subsequently took the position of Professor and Chairman of the Physics Department at [[Southeast Missouri State University]]. He was Department Chairman from 1964 to 1982 and retired from teaching in 1992.

== UFO Research ==
Challenged to explain sightings of unidentified lights and luminous phenomena in the sky around Piedmont, Missouri, Rutledge decided to subject these reports to scientific analysis. He put together a team of observers with college training in the physical sciences, including a large array of equipment: RF spectrum analyzers, [[Reflecting telescope|Questar telescopes]], low-high frequency audio detectors, electromagnetic frequency analyzer, cameras, and a galvanometer to measure variations in the Earth's gravitational field.

The resulting [[Project identification|Project Identification]] commenced in April 1973, logging several hundred hours of observation time. This was the first [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] scientific field study, able to monitor the phenomena in real-time, enabling Rutledge to calculate the objects' actual velocity, course, position, distance, and size.

Observation of the unclouded night sky often revealed "pseudostars" - stationary lights camouflaged by familiar constellations. Some objects appeared to mimic the appearance of known aircraft; others violated the laws of physics. The most startling discovery was that on at least 32 recorded occasions, the movement of the lights synchronized with actions of the observers. They appeared to respond to a light being switched on and off, and to verbal or radio messages. The final results of this project were documented in the 1981 book, ''Project Identification: The first Scientific Study of UFO Phenomena''.

Rutledge died on Monday, June 5, 2006 at the [[Missouri]] Veterans Home aged 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Greaney | first =TJ   | coauthors =  | title =Area UFO expert Dr. Harley Rutledge, 80, dies  | work =  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =[[semissourian]]  | date =June 6, 2006  | url =http://www.semissourian.com/story/1155552.html  | accessdate = 2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Frederick Comfort Crookshank, 1st Viscount Crookshank''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|CH|PC}} (27 May 1893 – 17 October 1961) was a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician. He was [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]] between 1951 and 1952 and [[Leader of the House of Commons]] between 1951 and 1955.

==Background and education==
Crookshank was born in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], the son of Harry Maule Crookshank and Emma, daughter of Major Samuel Comfort, of [[New York City]]. On his father's side, he descended from [[Alexander Crookshank]], of [[County Longford]], [[Ireland]], who represented [[Belfast (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Belfast]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]] and served as a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas in [[Ireland]]. He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. In the [[First World War]], he joined the [[Royal Hampshire Regiment|Hampshire Regiment]] and served as a captain in the [[Grenadier Guards]].&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p23247.htm#i232465 Harry Frederick Comfort Crookshank, 1st and last Viscount Crookshank]&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion he was buried alive by an explosion for twenty minutes, and on another in 1916 he was castrated by shrapnel, requiring him to wear a [[Truss (medicine)|surgical truss]] for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Ball 2004, p. 41, 60&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded by [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] the [[Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)|Order of the White Eagle]] and [[Gold Medal for Valour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of National Biography, 1961-1970|year=1971|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=249|isbn=0-19-865207-0}}Article by Viscount Chandos.&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the Diplomatic Service in 1919 and worked at the British Embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]] until 1924.

==Political career==
Crookshank was elected [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Gainsborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Gainsborough]] in 1924, a seat he held for the next 32 years.&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rayment"&gt;[http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Gcommons1.htm leighrayment.com House of Commons: Gainsborough to Goole]&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the government as [[Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department]] in 1934 under [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. When [[Stanley Baldwin]] became prime minister in 1935 Crookshank was appointed [[Secretary for Mines]], a post he retained when [[Neville Chamberlain]] became prime minister in 1937 until February 1939. In the latter year, he was sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=34595 |date=3 February 1939 |page=751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and made [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]]. He continued in this post also when [[Winston Churchill]] came to power in 1940,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighrayment.com/peers/peersC7.htm leighrayment.com Peerage: Cowper to Cutts of Gowran]&lt;/ref&gt; and was then [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] under Churchill between 1943 and 1945.&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"/&gt;

When the Conservatives returned to office under Churchill in 1951, Crookshank was appointed [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]] and [[Leader of the House of Commons]], with a seat in the cabinet. In 1952 exchanged his post at the Ministry of Health for the sinecure post of [[Lord Privy Seal]], while he remained as Commons Leader. He continued in these two positions until December 1955, the last year under the premiership of [[Anthony Eden|Sir Anthony Eden]].&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"/&gt; In the [[1955 New Year Honours]] he was made a [[Companion of Honour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=40366 |date=1 January 1955 |page=28 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighrayment.com/misc/compofhonor.htm leighrayment.com Companions of Honour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926113647/http://www.leighrayment.com/misc/compofhonor.htm |date=26 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 1956&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rayment"/&gt; and was raised to the peerage as the '''Viscount Crookshank''', of [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] in the [[County of Lincoln]], in January of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=40684 |date=13 January 1956 |page=278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been offered a peerage by Churchill in February 1940 but considered it at the time an insult as his First World War wounds had left him incapable of fathering any heir to a title.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 14|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=403}}Article by S.J. Ball.&lt;/ref&gt;

Papers released by The National Archives, London, November 2007, show that Crookshank, with [[Harold Macmillan]], led a faction within the Cabinet of Sir Winston Churchill's government, who opposed what they perceived to be an attempt to bounce the Cabinet into a premature decision to authorise a British thermonuclear bomb programme in July 1954.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Personal life==
Lord Crookshank was a [[Scottish Rite|33rd degree]] [[Freemason]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walton Hannah]], ''Christian by Degrees'' (London: [[The Britons|Britons Publishing Company]], 1954), 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Incapable as result of his First World War wounds of fathering children, Crookshank was a lifelong bachelor. He was also (not publicly) known as a homosexual and caused a near scandal when a male lover of his was adopted as Conservative candidate for the [[Grimsby (UK Parliament constituency)|Grimsby constituency]] in 1958 but later withdrawn.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Conservative candidate for Grimsby at the 1959 and 1964 elections, Wilfred Pearson, was not the same man.&lt;/ref&gt;

His home from 1937 was at 51 [[Pont Street]], [[Kensington, London]], where in 1947 he hosted a meeting of like-minded backbench MPs who unsuccessfully demanded Churchill's removal as Conservative Party leader.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt;

He died of [[cancer]]&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; at [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], [[London]], in October 1961, aged 68. The viscountcy died with him.&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"/&gt; Having been since 1960 High Steward of the City of Westminster, his funeral service took place at [[Westminster Abbey]], followed by burial at [[Lincoln Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt;

Telegraph'' (5 January 2005) accessed: 16 June 2008 ([https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1480407/Humphrey-Carpenter.html])&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he lived in the Warden's Lodgings at [[Keble College, Oxford]], where his father served as [[Warden (college)|Warden]] until his appointment as [[Bishop of Oxford]]. He was educated at the [[Dragon School]] Oxford, and [[Marlborough College]], and then read [[English studies|English]] at Keble.

His notable output of biographies included: ''[[J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'' (1977; also editing of ''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]''), ''The Inklings: CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, Charles Williams and their Friends'' (1978; winner of the 1978 [[Somerset Maugham Award]]), [[W. H. Auden]] (1981), [[Ezra Pound]] (1988; winner of the [[Duff Cooper Memorial Prize]]), [[Evelyn Waugh]] (1989), [[Benjamin Britten]] (1992), [[Robert Runcie]] (1997), [[Dennis Potter]] and [[Spike Milligan]] (2004). His last book, ''The Seven Lives of John Murray'' (2008) about [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] and the famous publishing house of Albemarle Street, was published posthumously.

He also wrote histories of [[BBC Radio 3]] (on which he had regular stints as broadcaster), the British satire boom of the 1960s, ''Angry Young Men: A Literary Comedy of the 1950s'' (2002), and a centennial history of the [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]] in 1985. His ''[[Mr Majeika]]'' series of children's books enjoyed considerable popularity and were successfully adapted for television. ''The Joshers: Or London to Birmingham with Albert and Victoria'' (1977) is a children's adventure book, similar in style to ''[[The Railway Children]]'' and based on the adventure of taking a working narrowboat up the [[Grand Union Canal]] from [[London]] to [[Birmingham]]. His encyclopaedic work ''The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature'' (1984), written jointly with his wife, has become a standard reference source.

A distinguished broadcaster, he began his career at [[BBC Oxford|BBC Radio Oxford]] as a presenter and producer where he met his future wife, Mari Prichard (whose father was [[Caradog Prichard]], the Welsh novelist and poet); they married in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;"Carpenter."

He played a role in launching Radio 3's  arts discussion programme ''[[Night Waves]]'' and acted as a regular presenter of other programmes on the network including Radio 3's afternoon drivetime programme ''[[In Tune]]'' and, until it was discontinued, its Sunday request programme ''Listeners' Choice''.  Until the time of his death, he presented the [[BBC Radio 4]] biography series ''[[Great Lives]]'' recorded in [[Bristol]]. The last edition recorded before his death featured an [[interview]] with the singer [[Eddi Reader]] about the poet [[Robert Burns]], the major focus of her creative work.  BBC Radio 4 broadcast this programme on New Year's Eve, 2004.

Carpenter's other abilities included being a talented amateur [[jazz]] musician and an accomplished player of the piano, the saxophone, and the [[double-bass]], playing the last instrument professionally in a dance band in the 1970s. In 1983, he formed a 1930s style jazz band, Vile Bodies, which for many years enjoyed a residency at the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] in London. He also founded the Mushy Pea Theatre Group, a children's drama group based in Oxford, which premiered his ''Mr Majeika: The Musical'' in 1991 and ''Babes'', a musical about [[Hollywood child stars]].

His death was the result of heart failure, compounded by the [[Parkinson's disease]] from which he had suffered for several years.  A commemorative stained glass window has been installed in St. Margaret's Institute, Polstead Road honouring Carpenter's many accomplishments. He is survived by his wife, and daughters Clare and Kate.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, "Humphrey Carpenter." 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James R. Domengeaux''', known as '''Jimmy Domengeaux''' (January 6, 1907 &amp;ndash; April 11, 1988), was a [[lawyer]] from [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Louisiana]], who served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] for [[Louisiana's 3rd congressional district]] from 1941 to 1949. He was a  [[Cajun]] cultural activist who is best remembered for his efforts to preserve the [[French language]] in his native state.

==Background==

Domengeaux was born in Lafayette to J. Rudolph Domengeaux and the former Marthe Mouton. He attended Mount Carmel Academy and Cathedral [[High school (North America)|High School]] in Lafayette. He obtained his undergraduate degree from the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] (then "Southwestern Louisiana Institute"). He also studied in [[New Orleans]] at both [[Loyola University New Orleans|Loyola University]] and [[Tulane University Law School]], from which he received his legal degree in 1931. He was admitted to the bar that same year and launched his law practice in Lafayette.

In 1962, Domengeaux was admitted to practice before the [[United States Supreme Court]]. He was senior member of Domengeaux and Wright (1931–1984). The firm maintained offices in Lafayette, New Orleans, [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] in [[Tangipahoa Parish]], and [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]], the seat of [[St. Landry Parish]] in south central Louisiana.

Domengeaux was married to the former Eleanor St. Julien (1921–2004); they had no children. They are interred at St. John's Cemetery in Lafayette.

==Political career==

He was a member, briefly, of the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] in 1940, until he was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the U.S. House. He defeated the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[sugar]] planter, [[David W. Pipes, Jr.]], of [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne Parish]]. Domengeaux first served in the U.S. House from 1941 to April 15, 1944, when he resigned to join the armed forces. He was a private in the Combat Engineers until he received a medical discharge. Thereafter, he was elected on November 7, 1944, to fill the vacancy in the 78th Congress caused by his own resignation. He hence served again from 1944 to 1949. Domengeaux did not seek reelection to Congress in 1948; instead he ran unsuccessfully for the [[U.S. Senate]] in a race ultimately won by [[Russell B. Long]], son of the legendary [[Huey Long|Huey Pierce Long, Jr.]] He was succeeded in the House by the freshman [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Edwin E. Willis]] of [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]], the seat of [[St. Martin Parish]]. He returned to the private practice of law in 1949.

==As cultural activist==

In 1968 Domengeaux accepted an appointment from Louisiana [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[John McKeithen]], his fellow Democrat, to preside over a new state-charted organization called the [[Council for the Development of French in Louisiana]], commonly known by the acronym CODOFIL.

As president of CODOFIL, Domengeaux spearheaded a statewide effort to introduce French education in public classrooms from elementary through high school levels.  He did so largely by recruiting teachers from [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Quebec]], and other French-speaking regions and nations around the world. Such recruitment placed Domengeaux at odds with the educational establishment, which preferred the hiring of local teachers.

This effort represented a major shift for Louisiana's educational system, which for decades had punished Cajun children for speaking French in school — a practice that more than any other factor had dramatically reduced the number of native French speakers in the state.&lt;ref name="punish"&gt;Shane K. Bernard, The ''Cajuns: Americanization of a People'' ([[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Mississippi]]: [[University Press of Mississippi]], 2003), p. xx, xxii-xxiii, 18-19, 33-34, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Domengeaux arranged for the then French President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] to visit Lafayette.

In the 1980s, Domengeaux embraced a new teaching method:  [[French immersion]], in which children were to be taught a variety of subjects in French for 60 percent of the school day. This method replaced the previous, less successful method of teaching French in only thirty-minute daily increments.

In addition to advancing French education, Domengeaux used CODOFIL as a watchdog organization that defended Cajuns from perceived affronts. For example, Domengeaux crusaded against use of the word "[[coonass]]," which he considered an ethnic slur against the Cajun people; and he condemned such Cajun humorists as the popular [[Justin Wilson (chef)|Justin Wilson]], who was born not in [[Acadiana]], but in Tangipahoa Parish, one of the "Florida Parishes" east of Baton Rouge, and who disagreed with Domengeaux politically.

A charismatic public figure, Domengeaux was often at odds with detractors, who criticized his reliance on international teachers as well as his emphasis on continental French to the exclusion of Cajun French.

For his efforts to save the French language in Louisiana, Domengeaux received an honorary doctorate from [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]], the Order of the [[Legion of Honor]] from the French government, and the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]] from Belgium, among numerous other citations. On November 11, 1986, coinciding with [[Veterans Day]], Lafayette Mayor [[Dud Lastrapes|William Dudley "Dud" Lastrapes]] and Governor [[Edwin Washington Edwards]] proclaimed "Jimmy Domengeaux Day". The University of Louisiana at Lafayette created an "Eminent Scholar Chair in Foreign Languages" in Domengeaux's honor.

The organization over which Domengeaux presided for the last two decades of his life, CODOFIL, continues to coordinate French education in Louisiana; and in his honor CODOFIL's supporting foundation offers a scholarship known as the ''Bourse James Domengeaux'' (James Domengeaux Scholarship).

Retrieved 26 April 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; He lied about his age to join the [[British Army]] during World War I aged just 14, serving for four years in the infantry before being honourably discharged in 1918. After the War he attended the [[University of Liverpool]] financed by a government grant and where he took his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1922 before attending [[Durham University]] for a year where he studied [[Psychoanalysis]] and took a Certificate in Education in 1923.&lt;ref name=Sci/&gt; In 1924 he married Charis Weare Grundy (1895/6–1975), a teacher and the daughter of James Grundy, a clergyman from Chicago, and with her he had one child, the author [[Brigid Brophy]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

After leaving university Brophy taught at a school in [[Cairo]] for two years in the 1920s&lt;ref name=Sci/&gt; before his wife's ill health forced him to return to England. His wife later wrote of her time in Egypt in her book ''Egyptian Portrait'' (c1930). Brophy later worked in a general store and as an advertising copywriter before becoming a full-time author, publishing his first novel, ''The Bitter End'', in 1928, and going on to write about 40 books, mostly based on his experiences as a soldier in the British Army during World War I. These included ''Pluck the Flower'' and ''Paul Lavelle'' (1929), as well as an anthology, ''The Soldier's War''. In 1930 with [[Eric Partridge]] he edited ''Songs and Slang of the British Soldier, 1914–1918'' (in 1965 revised as ''The Long Trail''). Through the 1930s he published at least one novel a year but it was not until 1939 that he had a real success, with his fictional life of [[William Shakespeare]], ''Gentleman of Stratford''.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Brophy was also a critic for various London newspapers and magazines including ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'' as well as for the [[BBC]]. He was the editor of ''[[John O'London's Weekly]]'' from 1940 to 1943 and during [[World War II]] he served in the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], for which he wrote handbooks and manuals and published the 'character study' ''Britain's Home Guard'' in 1945, which was illustrated by [[Eric Kennington]]. During the war years Brophy produced an 'entertainment' called ''Solitude Island'' (1941) and wrote war novels including ''Immortal Sergeant'' (1942), made into the 1943 [[Immortal Sergeant|film of the same name]] starring [[Henry Fonda]]; ''Spear Head'' (published in the United States as ''Spearhead'', 1943) and ''Target Island'' (1944).&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Brophy's later works included books on art such as ''The Human Face Reconsidered'' (1962), ''The Face in Western Art'' (1963); and ''The Face of the Nude'' (1965). His 1964 work on [[W. Somerset Maugham]] was written for the [[British Council]], and his later novels included ''City of Departures'' (1946), ''A Woman from Nowhere'' (1946), ''Sarah'' (1948), ''Julian's Way'' (1949), ''Turn the Key Softly'' (1951), ''The Prime of Life'' (1954), and ''The Day They Robbed the Bank of England'' (1959), made into a 1960 [[The Day They Robbed the Bank of England|film of the same name]] starring [[Peter O'Toole]] and [[Aldo Ray]].

'''John George Kemeny'''; May 31, 1926&lt;ref name=Springer/&gt; – December 26, 1992) was a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]]-[[Jewish]] born [[Americans|American]] [[mathematician]], [[Computer science|computer scientist]], and educator best known for co-developing&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|title= John Kemeny, 66, Computer Pioneer and Educator (obituary)|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3D8103EF934A15751C1A964958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=John+George+Kemeny&amp;st=nyt|date=1992-12-27|accessdate=2008-02-02 | first=Seth | last=Faison}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[BASIC programming language]] in 1964 with [[Thomas E. Kurtz]]. Kemeny served as the 13th President of [[Dartmouth College]] from 1970 to 1981 and pioneered the use of computers in college education. Kemeny chaired the presidential commission that investigated the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; According to [[György Marx]] he was one of [[The Martians (scientists)|The Martians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fizikaiszemle.hu/archivum/fsz9703/marsl.html A marslakók legendája - [[György Marx]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born in [[Budapest]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]],&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite book |title=Beyond Art - A Third Culture : a Comparative Study in Cultures, Art, and Science in 20th Century Austria and Hungary |last=Weibel |first=Peter |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=Springer |location= |isbn=3-211-24562-6 |pages=350 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xkk6U42Zl_sC&amp;pg=PA350 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemeny attended the Rácz private primary school in Budapest and was a classmate of [[Nandor Balazs]]. In 1938 his father left for the United States alone. In 1940, he took the whole Kemeny family to the United States&lt;ref name=Springer/&gt; when the adoption of the second anti-Jewish law in Hungary became imminent.&lt;ref name=Ohles/&gt; His grandfather, however, refused to leave and perished in the [[Holocaust]], along with an aunt and uncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=True Basic. A sketch of John Kemeny|publisher=''Dartmouth Alumni Magazine''|url=http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/news-resources/history/kemeny-history/TBasic.pdf|date=2001-12-13|accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemeny's family settled in New York City where he attended [[George Washington High School (New York City)|George Washington High School]]. He graduated with the best results in his class three years later.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; In 1943&lt;ref name=Springer/&gt; Kemeny entered [[Princeton University]] where he studied mathematics and philosophy, but he took a year off during his studies to work on the [[Manhattan Project]] in [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. His boss there was [[Richard Feynman]]. He also worked there with [[John von Neumann]]. Returning to Princeton, Kemeny graduated with his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1947, then worked for his Doctorate under [[Alonzo Church]], also at Princeton. He worked as [[Albert Einstein]]'s mathematical assistant during graduate school.&lt;ref name=Springer/&gt; At 23 years old, Kemeny was awarded his doctorate in 1949 for a dissertation entitled "[[Type theory|Type-Theory]] vs. [[Set theory|Set-Theory]]."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==Career==

Kemeny was appointed to the Dartmouth Mathematics Department as a full professor in 1953, at the age of 27.&lt;ref name=Springer/&gt; Two years later he became chairman of the Department, and held this post until 1967. 
Kemeny ventured into [[curriculum development]] when he introduced [[Finite mathematics]] courses. He teamed with [[Gerald L. Thompson]] and [[J. Laurie Snell]] to write ''Introduction to Finite Mathematics'' (1957) for students of biology and social sciences. The Dartmouth mathematics department professors also wrote ''Finite Mathematical Structures'' (1959) and ''Finite Mathematics with Business Applications'' (1962). Other colleges and universities followed this lead and several more textbooks in ''Finite Mathematics'' were composed elsewhere. The topic of [[Markov chain]]s was particularly popular so Kemeny teamed with J. Laurie Snell to publish ''Finite Markov Chains'' (1960) to provide an introductory college textbook. Considering the advances using [[potential theory]] obtained by G. A. Hunt, they wrote ''Denumerable Markov Chains'' in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. L. Doob]] (1966) Review: ''Denumerable Markov Chains'', {{mr|id=0207042}}&lt;/ref&gt; This textbook, suitable for advanced seminars,&lt;ref&gt;Preface, page vi&lt;/ref&gt; was followed by a second edition in 1976 when an additional chapter on [[random field]]s by David Griffeath was included.

Kemeny and Kurtz pioneered the use of computers for ordinary people. After early experiments with the [[LGP-30]], they invented the [[BASIC programming language]] in 1964, as well as one of the world's first [[time-sharing]] systems, the [[Dartmouth Time-Sharing System]] (DTSS). In 1974, the [[American Federation of Information Processing Societies]] gave an award to Kemeny and Kurtz at the [[National Computer Conference]] for their work on BASIC and time-sharing.&lt;ref name="ncc1974"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dtss.dartmouth.edu/transcript.php |title=TRANSCRIPTS OF 1974 National Computer Conference Pioneer Day Session |website=Dartmouth Time Sharing System |publisher=Dartmouth College |orig-year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kemeny was president of Dartmouth from 1970 to 1981, and continued to teach undergraduate courses and to do research and publish papers during his time as president. He presided over the coeducation of Dartmouth in 1972. He also instituted the "Dartmouth Plan" of year-round operations, thereby allowing more students without more buildings. During his administration, Dartmouth became more proactive in recruiting and retaining minority students&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; and revived its founding commitment to provide education for American Indians. Kemeny made Dartmouth a pioneer in student use of computers, equating computer literacy with reading literacy. In 1982 he returned to teaching full-time.

In 1983, Kemeny and Kurtz co-founded a company called True BASIC, Inc. to market [[True BASIC]], an updated version of the language.

'''John Michael D'Arcy''' (August 18, 1932 &amp;ndash; February 3, 2013) was an [[United States|American]] [[prelate]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He was the eighth [[diocesan bishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend|Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend]], Indiana. He was succeeded as diocesan bishop by [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] [[Kevin C. Rhoades]], who was named to the post by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] on Saturday, November 14, 2009. Until then, Bishop Rhoades had been bishop of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].

==Early life and ministry==
John D'Arcy was born in [[Brighton, Massachusetts|Brighton]], [[Massachusetts]], to [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]]. His parents were Michael and Margaret (Moran) D'Arcy.  He had three sisters:  Mrs. Mary Caprio, Sister Anne, and Mrs. Joan Sheridan.  He entered [[St. John's Seminary (Massachusetts)|St. John's Seminary]] in September 1949, and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] on February 2, 1957. D'arcy is an [[List of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas|alumnus]] of the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)|Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas ''Angelicum'']] where he studied from 1965 to 1968 earning a [[doctorate]] in spiritual [[theology]]. He served as [[Spiritual direction|spiritual director]] and [[professor]] of spiritual theology at St. John's Seminary from 1968 to 1985, and also as [[pastor]] of [http://www.beverlycatholic.com St. Mary Star of the Sea Church] in [[Beverly, Massachusetts|Beverly]].

==Episcopal career==
On December 30, 1974, D'Arcy was appointed [[Auxiliary bishop|Auxiliary Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston|Boston]] and [[Titular bishop|Titular Bishop]] of [[Mediana]] by [[Pope Paul VI]]. He received his [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopal consecration]] on February 11, 1975 from [[Humberto Sousa Medeiros|Humberto Sousa Cardinal Medeiros]], with Bishops [[Thomas Joseph Riley|Thomas Riley]] and [[Lawrence Joseph Riley|Lawrence Riley]] serving as [[Consecrator|co-consecrators]]. He became [[episcopal vicar]] for the [[Merrimack Pastoral Region|Lowell Region]] on July 21, 1981.

When serving as auxiliary bishop in Boston, D'Arcy "warned against the Catholic Church’s transfer of pedophile priest [[John Geoghan]] to a new parish, according to the church's own investigators. But Bishop D'Arcy's 1984 letter to Archbishop [[Bernard Francis Law]] about Geoghan’s history of abusing young boys did no good." Geoghan was left in his youth-groups job and "D'Arcy was transferred to Indiana".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, J.M., [https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/obituaries/2013/02/05/bishop-john-arcy-who-warned-boston-archdiocese-about-pedophile-priest-dies/5C6KSC9CqCx2JiNXtWc02N/story.html "Bishop John M. D’Arcy, 80; warned against transfer of pedophile to new parish"], Boston ''Globe'', February 05, 2013. Retrieved 2013-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bishop of Fort Wayne-South Bend===
D'Arcy was named [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend|Bishop of Fort Wayne-South Bend]], [[Indiana]], on February 26, 1985. Replacing [[William Edward McManus]], he was formally [[Enthronement|installed]] on the following May 1.

In March 2009, D'Arcy declared he would boycott the May graduation ceremony at the [[University of Notre Dame]] because [[US President|President]] [[Barack Obama]] would be delivering the [[commencement speech]] and receiving an [[honorary degree]].&lt;ref name=notre&gt;{{cite news|date=2009-03-24|work=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|title=Protesting bishop won't attend Notre Dame graduation|url=http://ncronline.org/news/politics/protesting-bishop-wont-attend-notre-dame-graduation|last=D'Arcy|first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting Obama's "unwillingness to hold [[Pro-choice|human life as sacred]]," he said that "a bishop must teach the Catholic faith 'in season and out of season,' and he teaches not only by his words&amp;ndash;but by his actions" and asked Notre Dame if by choosing Obama "it has chosen prestige over truth."&lt;ref name=notre/&gt;

He retired in 2009.

==Death and burial==
Bishop D'Arcy died on February 3, 2013, in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] from cancer at 80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bishop D'Arcy has died |author=Kevin Leininger (contributor) |url=http://www.news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130203/NEWS/130209861 |newspaper=[[News-Sentinel]] |date=3 February 2013 |accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death, visitations were held at both [[St. Matthew's Cathedral (South Bend, Indiana)|St. Matthew's Cathedral]] in South Bend and the [[Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Fort Wayne, Indiana)|Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception]] in Fort Wayne.

Asasumasu is known for deliberately provocative and political writing on [[autism]] on her current and former blogs, and her strong stance against the ideas that autism should be cured, that autistic people are broken, or that non-autistic parents of autistic children have more expertise on autism than autistic people themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/night-out|title=A Night Out {{!}} Commonweal Magazine|website=www.commonwealmagazine.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebodyisnotanapology.com/magazine/at-the-intersection-of-white-privilege-and-disability/|title=At the Intersection of White Privilege and Disability|date=2017-11-29|work=The Body Is Not An Apology|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also known for coining the term "neurodivergent" to describe a person with atypical neurological functioning or processes, and "[[neurodivergence]]" to describe various types of atypical neurological functioning or processes, including [[developmental disabilities]], [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], and [[Mental disorder|mental illnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982501293|title=Authoring autism : on rhetoric and neurological queerness|last=1984-|first=Yergeau, Melanie,|isbn=9780822372189|location=Durham|oclc=982501293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Asasumasu claimed that autism charity [[Autism Speaks]] plagiarized and misattributed her work on [[self-advocacy]] by using quotes from a self-advocacy curriculum she had developed without consent, profiting from her work while opposing the goals of her activism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timetolisten.blogspot.com/2011/02/autism-speaks-shut-up-and-listen.html|title=Radical Neurodivergence Speaking: Autism Speaks: SHUT UP AND LISTEN|last=K|first=Neurodivergent|date=2011-02-04|website=Radical Neurodivergence Speaking|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asasumasu's blog post concerning the plagiarism prompted a comment from an individual purporting to be writing on behalf of Autism Speaks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2014, Asasumasu delivered a lecture entitled "DisAbused: Rethinking the Presumption of Caregiver Benevolence" for the D Center (Deaf and Disability Cultural Center) at the [[University of Washington|University of Washington-Seattle]], later delivering the same lecture for [[Georgetown University]]'s Lecture and Performance Series on Disability Justice organized by fellow autistic activist [[Lydia Brown]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-56901-7_10|title=Religion, Disability, and Interpersonal Violence|last=Brown|first=Lydia X.

In a blog post, Asasumasu described her ethnicity as [[biracial]], [[Hapa]], [[Hāfu|Hafu]], [[Eurasia]]n, [[Mongols|Mongolian]], [[Romanians|Romanian]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], and [[Croats|Croatian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neuroqueer.blogspot.com/2013/09/kassiane-sibleys-open-letter-to.html|title=NeuroQueer: Kassiane A.

==Fictional character biography==
{{Plot|section=y|date=December 2009}}

===Origin and early heroics===
Eddie had the good fortune of being a [[gofer]] in his Aunt Marla's film company. He met [[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]] on a film set, and became quite a fan of the hero, dreaming about one day becoming Blue’s sidekick.

Edward snuck into Blue Devil's workshop at night and, using his prodigious knowledge of electronics, created a [[powered exoskeleton|battlesuit]] incorporating the designs of the Blue Devil suit. Even though Blue Devil did not want a sidekick, Eddie was determined to make a go at being a hero. As "Kid Devil", he assisted his hero in foiling an airplane hijacking, and later helped defeat one of his enemies, the Vanquisher. After these adventures, his parents left Eddie's education and supervision to professors at the Institute of Hypernormal Conflict Studies.

After Eddie's Aunt Marla died in a helicopter crash, Eddie attempted to live up to her name and succeed in the movie business. His attempts failed, however, and Eddie continued to have adventures as Kid Devil. He helps [[Young Justice]]'s assault on Zandia, a small country that has become a refuge for supervillains.&lt;ref&gt;''Young Justice'' #49-50 (December 2002)&lt;!--publication month and year need including--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes and Titans===
Since the events in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Eddie has tried to join the [[Teen Titans]] with little success. Pulsar helps Eddie get into a project [[Lex Luthor]] has been using to give normal humans superpowers. However, Eddie fails because of "psychological problems". One evening, Eddie is visited by a cloaked figure, who gives him a candle. Eddie then goes to find his friend, [[Zachary Zatara]]. Zatara, being a magician, knows a little about magic and tells Eddie that the candle is a '' 'demon stick' '', forged in demon's blood. Zatara tells Eddie that if you light it, it will take you to its creator (which could be anyone). Eddie asks if, after teleporting them both to the creator, Zatara could just teleport them back. Zatara brags that he could, even though his magic could only affect things, not people. Not knowing of Zatara's inability to teleport anyone anywhere, Eddie decides to light it and the two are taken to [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]]. Neron makes a deal with Eddie, transforming him into a ''new'' Kid Devil. Neron's magic gives Eddie a new, [[demon]]ic appearance and inherent superpowers. As part of the deal, Eddie will not lose his soul to Neron if he can still trust Blue Devil by his 20th birthday. Before Eddie leaves, Neron tells him that it is Blue Devil's fault that his Aunt Marla died. Zachary helps Eddie join the Teen Titans, they battle [[Kid Crusader]], and Zachary promises to keep his secret.

[[One Year Later]], a rift has formed between Eddie and Zachary. Though Eddie is still friendly with Zachary, the boy magician wants nothing to do with Eddie or any of the other Titans. Eddie also forges a bond with [[Rose Wilson]], as both new members feel like third-string Titans. For many months, Eddie tells the Titans of multiple daily [[phone call]]s to Blue Devil as his way of confirming that "everything is fine".&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #34 (May 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

On a Titans mission, Eddie is [[disemboweled]] by [[Plasmus]] and the [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s are unable to help him. The new [[Doom Patrol]] arrives and take Kid Devil to their HQ for treatment, where the [[Chief (comics)|Chief]] heals Eddie while also attempting to manipulate him into joining the Doom Patrol (as he has done to the other DP members). During the operation, the Chief revealed to [[Elasti-Girl]] that Kid Devil is not truly a demon by nature, but rather his powers are the result of metahuman gene manipulation. Robin calls Blue Devil, as he is on Kid Devil's emergency contact list, but finds that the number is out of order. Robin eventually tracks down Blue Devil and tells him the situation. Blue Devil tells Robin that he has not seen or spoken to Eddie in two years. When Robin confronts Eddie about his relationship with Blue Devil, Eddie confesses he was only pretending in order to better fit in with the Titans. The Chief's manipulation is stopped by both the Titans and the other members of the Doom Patrol, which makes Eddie feel as if he is finally accepted as a Titan since they stood up for him. He also tries rekindling his bond with Blue Devil, but the man does not show up to a meeting to which Eddie invited him. Later, Eddie finally finds and confronts Blue Devil. Blue Devil admits that he was to blame for his Aunt Marla's death and that it was an accident. As part of a deal with Neron for gaining fame and fortune, Blue Devil was asked to destroy an unmanned electrical power station. Despite Blue Devil's various precautions, a resulting power surge accidentally killed Marla, who was scouting the nearby area for a film. Eddie storms off before Blue Devil can explain further, telling Blue Devil to stay far away from him. Now having lost his trust in Blue Devil, Eddie knows that he will lose his soul to Neron. Still, Eddie decides to make the best of his remaining years by having a good time with his friends. He comforts himself by saying that, at least, he has Marla's memory and that Neron cannot take that away from him. However, it is revealed that Neron is holding Marla's soul captive.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #42 (February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kid Devil is attacked by Kid Crusader, who vows to "save" him from Neron by turning Eddie back into a human and killing him. Kid Crusader appears to succeed when he exorcizes the demon from Eddie and returns him to his human form, but the demon is now bound to Kid Crusader himself. When given the choice later to either return to his demonic form or stay human, Eddie chooses his demonic form, not wishing to damn anyone else (even his enemy) to his fate as Neron's protégé.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #43-44 (March-April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Titans Tomorrow''===
In ''Teen Titans'' #51 (vol. 3)&lt;!--publication month and year need including--&gt;, the ''[[Titans Tomorrow]]'' (a possible future version of the current Titans team) arrive in the present to aid the Teen Titans against [[Starro]]-controlled villains. Kid Devil is shown as part of the team, now known as '''Red Devil'''. He claims that even though the loss of his soul to Neron at 20 was bad, the power he receives far outweighs the consequences. 

Eddie initially watches as Ravager battles alone against [[Rampage (DC Comics)|Rampage]] and [[Livewire (DC Comics)|Livewire]], before betraying his older self in order to aid Rose. Later, Rose, Red Devil, and Eddie return to the Titan's Lair (home of the original Teen Titans), where they meet with [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]]. There, Eddie learns that he is supposedly destined to murder the Blue Beetle some point in the future.

Shortly after Eddie, Rose, and Jaime find themselves surrounded by an army of Titans led by [[Lex Luthor]] before they all battle against an invading army of Starros. Thanks in large part to Blue Beetle's powers and Robin and [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]] managing to supposedly alter Robin's future (and thus alter the future of the Titans as a whole), the army of Titans is defeated. However, prior to his vanishing, Red Devil warns Eddie against trusting Blue Beetle.

===Terror Titans===
In ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #56&lt;!--publication month and year need including--&gt;, a group of supervillains under the leadership of the new [[Clock King]] began a systematic assault on the Titans. With Wonder Girl, Blue Beetle, Ravager, and [[Tim Drake|Robin]] away and [[Miss Martian]] still reeling from the battle with her future counterpart (whose mind is revealed to have taken refuge in Megan's), Eddie decides to throw a party in [[Titans Tower]] and invites several Titans fans. The party quickly gets out of hand when the guests trash the place, go through personal items, and prank call [[Batman]]. Lectured by all members of the team (except Miss Martian, who had left for the week to resolve her own problems), Eddie goes into town with one of the guests, who reveals himself to be Dreadbolt, the son of [[Bolt (DC Comics)|Bolt]]. A fight ensues and the arrival of the rest of the [[Terror Titans]] puts a quick end to the battle.

In the aftermath, Kid Devil finds himself chained to a wall and severely injured, captive of the Clock King, who then begins shattering his self-confidence telling him that [[Rose Wilson]] could not care less about his status, encouraging him to accept his place as a monster. Brought to the [[Dark Side Club]] as a challenger, he is imprisoned in the same cell in which [[Miss Martian]] is later brought, who finds him reduced to a rampaging, savage monster due to his physical and mental ordeal. M'Gann tries unsuccessfully to undo the damage, but Eddie is brought to face Hardrock in a death match.
&lt;!--don't include details not known to or experienced by Kid Devil (Eddie).--&gt;

===Red Devil===
After the crisis with the Terror Titans is settled, Kid Devil is saved, and with the help of the Teen Titans, is able to rebuild his mental sanity while he is nursed back to health.

Still trying to prove himself, he begins searching for [[Shockwave (comics)#DC Comics|Shockwave]], who is rampaging apparently without a pattern throughout America, deliberately hiding from Robin his suspicions to avoid burdening the decimated Titans with an apparent [[wikt:wild-goose chase#Noun|wild goose chase]].

He is forced then to accept the unwilling cooperation of Blue Beetle, who, demonstrating to be a better detective than he and a more seasoned fighter despite his later induction into heroics, goes on alone. In a fit of anger spurred by his inability to come in and fight Shockwave, he finally unlocks the full might of his demonic powers, as demonstrated by [[Titans Tomorrow|his future counterpart]], teleporting effortlessly from Salt Lake City to Denver and melting off Shockwave's exoskeleton with a touch.

Kid Devil is able to resolve his jealousy issues about Ravager when he learns that Blue Beetle had no interest in her at all. He then honors his newfound maturity by taking the [[sobriquet]] of ''Red Devil''. Jaime happily teases Eddie about his new costume, hinting that while in the ''Tomorrow'' history they were sworn enemies; at present, they have a budding friendship signified by Eddie giving Jaime the playful nickname ''"Bug-Butt"'' which Jaime reciprocates by calling him ''"Sizzle-Shorts"''.

Around this time the events of ''Final Crisis'' happen, Eddie becomes one of the last few super-powered resistance members operating out of the time-tossed Justice League Watchtower. The [[Miracle Machine]] restores everything back to normal.&lt;ref&gt;''Final Crisis'' #7 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, soon after Blue Beetle joins the team, Miss Martian, with whom Eddie had become increasingly closer, has opted to leave the team due in large part to her being merged with her evil future self. Still, Eddie appears to have become more content with his life amongst the Titans and has become closer to Blue Beetle and his girlfriend [[Traci 13]]. During a Christmas trip to New York, Miss Martian appeared to him to wish him a Merry Christmas and promised that she would return soon.

Soon after, the Titans began having a membership drive, with Red Devil teleporting to each potential hero so as to offer them membership. Unfortunately, none seem available or willing to join. The stress of multiple 'ports eventually causes Eddie to pass out on his return to the tower. On the night that follows, Robin opts to leave the team shortly before [[Brother Blood]] returns from Hell. During the battle against him, Blood manages to absorb the demonic power from Eddie, leaving him human again and supposedly free of Neron's debt.

===Powerless===
Eddie, now powerless, is offered by [[Kid Eternity]] a chance to travel to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] and see his contract with Neron in an attempt to regain his powers. Learning that he had not signed the contract, he finds that Neron tapped into his metagene, which activated his demon-like powers. [[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]], having won the [[Reign in Hell|war in Hell]], offers Eddie a new contract, with his demonic powers now irrevocable, but with the same price of servitude as Neron's contract. Kid Eternity intervenes and summons Eddie's Aunt Marla. Marla convinces Eddie not to take the contract.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #68 (March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Eddie continues to be a member of the team, but his ability to help is unclear. To add insult to injury, Eddie is asked by new Titan recruit [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] if he is the "team janitor" due to his lack of abilities.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #69 (April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; During the prelude to the '''''Deathtrap''''' crossover, Eddie dons his old mechanical costume to combat the Tower's defense mechanisms, which had been overridden by crazed former Titan [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]].&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans Annual'' #1&lt;!--publication month and year need including--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

His way of helping, which [[Bombshell (DC Comics)|Bombshell]] repeatedly makes fun of, is to be the eyes and ears for the Teen Titans when the new [[Fearsome Five]] reform under the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]]. However, he is also seen as helping the team through communications and coordinating missions at Titans Tower. 

He later died saving the city from a radioactive man who was about to explode while the other Titans were putting down a prison riot. It appears that this was all part of the Calculator's plan to get revenge at the Titans for the previous death of his son [[Wendy and Marvin|Marvin]] and the injury of his daughter [[Wendy and Marvin|Wendy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #74 (August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Eddie Bloomberg first appears as the godson to Blue Devil.&lt;ref&gt;''DC Presents'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Kiddevildc.png|thumb|right|150px|Kid Devil in his power suit from ''Blue Devil'' #14, artist Paris Cullins]]
Originally, Eddie wore a devil suit which gave him enhanced strength and agility, near impenetrable armor, a weapons system that included a bright light burst effect, exploding bubbles, night vision, and mini-gills. He also had a rocket trident which could propel him through the air for distances of up to several miles and could emit flames and/or electric shocks.

[[One Year Later|After the events]] of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' and ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', Eddie has a [[demonic]] appearance and inherent abilities, both granted to him by the demon-lord [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]]. His new form gives him a capacity to breathe fire, enhanced strength and endurance, and an ability to heal from non-fatal wounds ten times faster than a human. When punched in the stomach, Eddie cannot control his fire breath. Eddie's blood is now a thick [[gasoline]]-smelling liquid, his breath is hotter than fire, his own skin is able to cause burns (being at 200 degrees) and he has been seen to be able to increase this, to the point of his skin turning white hot. He can fire streams of flame from his hands, has retractable wings underneath his arms that help him glide, possesses a prehensile tail, and his internal temperature is 600°. He learned how to create portals of fire through which he can travel long distances.

When Dr. Niles Caulder, leader of the Doom Patrol, tended Kid Devil's injury, he revealed that the young hero is not a demon nor are his powers supernatural in nature, despite being granted by a demon. Rather, Neron activated Eddie's [[metahuman]] gene which gave him his powers. However, like a real demon, his skin still burns while inside a church due to his deal with Neron.

Eddie lost his powers due to an attack by the new Brother Blood, Sebastion, shortly before sacrificing himself to save the other Titans.

==Other versions==
===''Flashpoint''===
In the alternate universe of ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'', Kid Devil is a member of the Resistance.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: Deadman and the Flying Graysons'' #3 (August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Final Crisis''===
A spacebound Blue Devil met a futuristic version of Edward who was saved from being erased from existence. Blue Devil also encountered a Nazi version of him.

===''Tiny Titans''===
Kid Devil appears in ''[[Tiny Titans]]'' as a toddler. [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] often has to babysit for him. Her father, [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]], shows more of an interest in Kid Devil than in Raven when she does. He thinks of Kid Devil as "a cute little baby". Raven often tells Trigon that Kid Devil is not a baby, he is a little kid. However, Trigon does not listen and only babies Kid Devil more. Kid Devil does not speak in this series and relies solely on visual gags. In one issue, Kid Devil travels to the center of the Earth with [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], [[Hotspot (character)|Hotspot]], and [[Beast Boy]], and meets [[Etrigan the Demon|Etrigan]].

In March 2014, Cavallari drew national criticism for refusing to vaccinate her children, a decision her husband, Jay Cutler, and she based on fears of a [[connection between childhood vaccination and autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/03/14/kristin-cavallari-defends-decision-not-to-vaccinate-her-son/ |title=Kristin Cavallari defends decision not to vaccinate her son |date=March 14, 2014 |publisher=[[Fox News]] |accessdate=July 13, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125094835/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/03/14/kristin-cavallari-defends-decision-not-to-vaccinate-her-son/ |archivedate= January 25, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eby|first=Margaret |date=March 19, 2014 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/kristin-cavallari-defends-anti-vaccination-decision-article-1.1726819 |title=Kristin Cavallari defends anti-vaccination choice: 'We feel like we're making the best decision for our kids'|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location=New York City |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917161537/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/kristin-cavallari-defends-anti-vaccination-decision-article-1.1726819 |archivedate=September 17, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Takeda |first=Allison |date=March 19, 2014|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kristin-cavallari-defends-anti-vaccine-stance-were-making-the-best-decision-for-our-kids-2014193 |title=Kristin Cavallari Defends Anti-Vaccine Stance: 'We're Making the Best Decision for Our Kids' |work=[[Us Weekly]] |archivedate=May 12, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512043452/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kristin-cavallari-defends-anti-vaccine-stance-were-making-the-best-decision-for-our-kids-2014193 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2015–2016, the former website [[Gawker]] ran a series of daily articles on Cavallari for a streak of 415 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=James|first=James|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/gawker-editor-chief-alex-pareene-we-wont-be-garbage-buzzfeed-or-humorless-vox-2190229|access-date=August 24, 2016|date=November 18, 2015|website=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series, by Allie Jones, was called "500 Days of Kristin", although it ended after just 415 days, with the publication of Cavallari's book ''Balancing in Heels''. By treating Cavallari's quotidian [[Instagram]] posts as newsworthy, the series appeared to gently mock the culture of celebrity women on social media.

'''Muhammad Ma Jian''' ([[Gejiu]], 1906 – [[Beijing]], 1978) ({{lang-ar|محمد ماكين الصيني}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Muḥammad Mākīn as-Ṣīnī}}'';&lt;ref name="VersteeghEid2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kees Versteegh|author2=Mushira Eid|title=Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics: A-Ed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SuNiAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA382|year=2005|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-14473-6|pages=382–}}&lt;/ref&gt; English translation: Muhammad Ma Jian the Chinese) was a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[Islam]]ic scholar and translator of Muslim [[Hui]] ethnicity.  He is notable for translating the [[Qur'an]] into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and stressing compatibility between [[Marxism]] and [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Mao |first=Yufeng |date=2007 |title=Sino-Muslims in Chinese Nation-building, 1906-1956 |type=Ph.D. diss. |publisher= George Washington University, 126-127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==
Jian was born in 1906 in Shadian, a village in the [[Gejiu]] county of [[Yunnan]]. This was a majority-Hui village that would later be the site of the infamous [[Shadian incident]] during China's [[Cultural Revolution]]. When Jian was six years old, he was sent to the provincial capital of [[Kunming]], where he would receive his primary and secondary education until the age of 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Amrullah |first=Amri |date=June 15, 2015 |title=Muhammad Ma Jian, Intelektual Muslim Modern Cina |trans-title=Muhammad Ma Jian, Muslim Intellectual of Modern China |url=http://www.republika.co.id/berita/dunia-islam/islam-digest/15/06/15/npz6cw-muhammad-ma-jian-intelektual-muslim-modern-cina-1 |language=Indonesian |newspaper=Republika |location=Jakarta |access-date=February 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his graduation, Jian returned to his hometown of Shadian to teach at a Sino-Arabic primary school for two years - an experience which he did not enjoy. This was followed by a stint of study under [[Hu Songshan]] in [[Guyuan]], a city in the Hui region of [[Ningxia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aubin |first=Françoise |editor-last1=Dudoignon |editor-first1=Stéphane A. |editor-last2=Hisao |editor-first2=Komatsu |editor-last3=Yasushi |editor-first3=Kosugi |title=Intellectuals in the Modern Islamic World: Transmission, Transformation and Communication |publisher=Routledge |date=2006 |pages=260–261 |chapter=Islam on the wings of nationalism: the case of Muslim intellectuals in Republican China |isbn=978-0415549790}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to [[Shanghai]] for further education in 1929, where he studied at the Shanghai Islamic Normal School for 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ciecura |first= Wlodzimierz |date=April 28, 2015 |title=Bringing China and Islam Closer: The First Chinese Azharites |url=http://www.mei.edu/content/map/bringing-china-and-islam-closer-first-chinese-azharites |newspaper=Middle East Institute |access-date=February 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Study in Cairo ==
Following the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931, Jian was sent by the [[Government of the Republic of China|Chinese government]] to [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], to cultivate relations with Arab nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Haiyun |first=Ma |date=May 10, 2013 |title=Go West at What Cost?

Whilst in Cairo, he would also subsequently translate several of [[Muhammad Abduh]]'s works into Chinese, with the assistance of [[Rashid Rida]],&lt;ref&gt;Ciecura.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[:fr:Husayn al-Jisr|Husayn al-Jisr]]'s ''The Truth of Islam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chen |first=John T. |date=2014 |title=Re-Orientation: The Chinese Azharites between Umma and Third World, 1938-1955 |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=35 |doi=10.1215/1089201x-2648560}}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote Chinese interests in the context of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Jian was sent to [[Mecca]] in early 1939 as part of a [[hajj]] delegation alongside 27 other students - a journey on which they spoke to [[Ibn Saud]] about the determination of 'all the Chinese people' to resist the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mao |first=Yufeng |date=2011 |title=A Muslim Vision for the Chinese Nation: Chinese Pilgrimage Missions to Mecca during World War II |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=386–387 |doi=10.1017/S0021911811000088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return to China ==
Jian returned to China in 1939. There he edited the ''Arabic-Chinese Dictionary'', while translating the ''[[Qur'an]]'' and works of [[Islamic philosophy]] and [[Islamic History|history]]. He also became a professor of Arabic and [[Islamic studies]] at [[Peking University]] in 1946, a role in which he oversaw the introduction of the first Arabic-language courses in the [[Chinese higher education|Chinese higher education system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haiyun |first=Ma |date=2006 |title=Patriotic and Pious Muslim Intellectuals in Modern China: The Case of Ma Jian |journal=The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Peking University, he would train many of the next generation's most prominent Chinese [[Arabist]]s, such as [[:de:Zhu Weilie|Zhu Weilie]].&lt;ref&gt;Ma (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; His initial translation of the Qur'an's first 8 volumes was completed in 1945, and after being rejected by Beijing publishing houses in 1948, this was published by Peking University Press a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Spira |first=Ivo |date=2005 |title=Chinese Translations of the Qur'ān: A Close Reading of Selected Passages |type=MA diss. |publisher=Oslo University |url=http://folk.uio.no/ivos/files/MA_Thesis_IvoSpira.pdf |access-date=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Communist victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the proclamation of the People's Republic of China, he was also elected as a member of the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Ciecura.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, another edition of his Qur'an translation was published by [[Shanghai]]'s [[Commercial Press]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waardenburg |first=Jacques |editor-last=Akiner |editor-first=Shirin |title=Cultural Change &amp; Continuity In Central Asia |publisher=Routledge |date=2009 |pages=340 |chapter=Islam in China: Western Studies |isbn=978-1136150340}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jian became one of the founders of the [[Islamic Association of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guanglin |first=Zhang |date=2005 |title=Islam in China |location=Beijing |publisher=China Intercontinental Press, 77}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this role, Jian also aimed to increase public awareness of Islam - which he did by publishing several articles in newspapers such as the [[People's Daily]] and the [[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gao |first=Zhanfu |editor-last1=Yijiu |editor-first1=Jin |editor-last2=Wai-Yip |editor-first2=Ho  |title=Islam |publisher=Brill |date=2017 |pages=73–74 |chapter=Studies of Islam in China in the Twentieth Century |isbn=978-9004174542}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published a translation of [[:fy:Tjitze de Boer|Tjitze de Boer]]'s ''History of Philosophy in Islam'' in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Gao, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his linguistic skills, he served as a high-level interpreter for Chinese officials such as [[Zhou Enlai]], whom he enabled to speak to [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] at the [[Bandung Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Benite |first=Zvi Ben-Dor |editor-last1=Gelvin |editor-first1=James L. |editor-last2=Green |editor-first2=Nile |title=Global Muslims in the Age of Steam and Print |publisher=University of California Press |date=2013 |pages=264 |chapter=Taking 'Abduh to China: Chinese-Egyptian Intellectual Contact in the Early Twentieth Century |isbn=978-1-234-56789-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this that allowed him to keep his professorship and post in the PPCC until his death in 1978, despite widespread persecution of Muslims during the upheaval of the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boyle |first1=Kevin |last2=Sheen |first2=Juliet |date=2013 |title=Freedom of Religion and Belief: A World Report |location=London |publisher=Routledge |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death, Jian's translation of [[Philip K. Hitti]]'s [[History of the Arabs (book)|History of the Arabs]] was published in 1979 by the [[Commercial Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zhixue |first=Ma |date=2008 |url=http://www.mesi.shisu.edu.cn/_upload/article/1d/5d/1cde03e04dc083c0a7d481129f92/decdc0b0-a303-4cce-a284-2cb70ba51fdf.pdf |title=The Latest Edition of ''History of the Arabs'': Prefaces and Postscript |journal=Arab World Studies |volume=5 |pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  [[China Social Sciences Press]] also posthumously printed, in 1981, his complete translation of the Qur'an, which Jian had worked on up until 1957, and then between 1976 and 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Petersen |first=Kristian |title=Qur'anic Interpretation in China |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t343/e0154 |newspaper=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |access-date=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Ma Jian has been praised for his 'two-way' contribution to [[Sino-Arab relations|Sino-Arab]] [[Cultural exchange|cross-cultural exchange]] - that is, his translations of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] literature into Arabic, and Quran into Chinese.

His translation of the Qur'an remains the most popular in China today, surpassing versions by [[Wang Jingzhai]] and Li Tiezheng.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wang |first=Jin |date=2016 |title=Middle East Studies in China: Achievements and Problems |url=http://www.rubincenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/06_Wang-tz-au-TZ-PDF.pdf |journal=Middle East Review of International Affairs |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been lauded for its faithfulness to the original, and has reached an 'almost canonical status'.&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of this translation has also been recognised internationally - with the [[Medina]]-based [[King Fahd Complex for the Printing of the Holy Quran|King Fahd Holy Qur'an Printing Press]] opting to use it for their Arabic-Chinese bilingual edition of the Quran, published in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norma Leah McCorvey'''  '''Nelson'''; (September 22, 1947&amp;nbsp;– February 18, 2017), better known by the legal pseudonym "'''Jane Roe'''", was the [[plaintiff]] in the landmark American lawsuit ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' in 1973.&lt;ref name="Norma McCorvey"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/28/garden/at-home-with-norma-mccorvey-of-roe-dreams-and-choices.html |title = Norma McCorvey: Of Roe, Dreams and Choices |first = Alex |last = Witchel |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = July 28, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that individual state laws banning [[abortion]] are unconstitutional. Later, McCorvey's views on abortion changed substantially; she became a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] activist in the [[Anti-abortion movements|pro-life]] movement.&lt;ref name="Roe v. McCorvey"&gt;{{cite web |last = McCorvey |first = Norma |last2 = Thomas |first2 = Gary |last-author-amp = yes |date = January 1998 |url = http://www.leaderu.com/common/roev.html |title = Roe v.

==Early life==
McCorvey was born in [[Simmesport, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/02/norma-mccorvey-roe-v-wade-abortion |title = The Accidental Activist |date = February 2013 |work = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |last = Prager |first = Joshua |access-date = April 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was briefly raised at her family's residence in [[Lettsworth, Louisiana|Lettsworth]] in [[Pointe Coupee Parish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = McCorvey |first1 = Norma |last2 = Meisler |first2 = Andy |last-author-amp = yes |title = I Am Roe |year = 1994 |location = New York |publisher = Harper Collins |isbn = 0-06-017010-7 |page = 11  |ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in her childhood, the family moved to [[Houston]], Texas.  McCorvey's father left the family when she was 13 years old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Ed |last = Pilkington |date = July 6, 2009 |url = https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/07/norma-mccorvey-abortion-america |title = These Steps Are Covered with Blood |work = [[The Guardian]] |location = London |access-date = February 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and her parents subsequently divorced.  She and her older brother were raised by their mother Mildred, a violent alcoholic.  McCorvey's father died on September 27, 1995.  She was of partial [[Cajun]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="Norma McCorvey"/&gt;

McCorvey had entered a Catholic boarding school&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt; prior to her minor troubles with law enforcement that started at the age of ten, when she robbed the cash register at a gas station and ran away to [[Oklahoma City]] with a friend.&lt;ref name="Norma McCorvey" /&gt; They tricked a hotel worker into letting them rent a room, and were there for two days when a maid walked in on her and her female friend kissing.&lt;ref name="Norma McCorvey obituary"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlson|first1=Michael|title=Norma McCorvey obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/19/norma-mccorvey-obituary|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCorvey was arrested and brought to court, where she was declared a ward of the state and sent to state-run institutions.&lt;ref name="Norma McCorvey obituary"/&gt;

Later, McCorvey was sent to the State School for Girls in [[Gainesville, Texas]], on and off from ages 11 to 15. She said this was the happiest time of her childhood, and every time she was sent home, would purposely do something bad to be sent back. After being released, McCorvey lived with her mother’s cousin, who allegedly raped her every night for three weeks. When McCorvey's mother found out, her cousin claimed McCorvey was lying.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McCorvey|Meisler|1994|pages = 23–47 |ps=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working at a restaurant, Norma met Woody McCorvey (born 1940), and she married him at the age of 16.  She later left him after he allegedly [[domestic violence|assaulted]] her. She moved in with her mother and gave birth to her first child, Melissa, in 1965.&lt;ref name="People"&gt;{{cite news |first1 = Michelle |last1 = Green |first2 = Lois |last2 = Armstrong |last-author-amp = yes |date = May 22, 1989 |url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20120340,00.html |title = The Woman Behind ''Roe V.

Soon after, she began identifying as a lesbian. She went on a weekend trip to visit two friends and left her baby with her mother. When she returned, her mother replaced Melissa with a baby doll and reported her to the police as having abandoned her baby, and called the police to take her out of the house. She would not tell her where Melissa was for weeks and finally let her visit her child after three months. She allowed McCorvey to move back in, and one day woke Norma up after a long day of work. She told Norma to sign insurance papers, and Norma did so without reading. However, she signed adoption papers, giving her mother custody of Melissa, and was then kicked out of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McCorvey|Meisler|1994|page=|ps=.}}{{page needed|date= February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, McCorvey again became pregnant and gave birth to a baby, who was placed for adoption.&lt;ref name="Washington Post 2017"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/norma-mccorvey-jane-roe-of-roe-v-wade-decision-legalizing-abortion-dies-at-69/2017/02/18/24b83108-396e-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html |title = Norma McCorvey, Jane Roe of ''Roe v.

==''Roe v. Wade''==
{{Main|Roe v. Wade}}
In 1969, at the age of 21, McCorvey became pregnant a third time and returned to [[Dallas]]. According to McCorvey, friends advised her that she should assert falsely that she had been [[rape]]d and that she could thereby obtain a legal abortion  under Texas's law which prohibited abortion; sources differ over whether the Texas law had such a rape exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Roe v.

Eventually, McCorvey was referred to attorneys [[Linda Coffee]] and [[Sarah Weddington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Roe+v.+Wade |title = ''Roe v. Wade'' |work = Free Online Law Dictionary |year = 2014 |accessdate = June 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McCorvey|Meisler|1994|page=|ps.= }}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were looking for pregnant women who were seeking abortions. The case took three years of trials to reach the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], and Norma never attended a single trial. In the meantime, she had given birth to the baby in question, who was eventually adopted.&lt;ref name="Norma McCorvey"/&gt;

McCorvey revealed herself to the press as being "Jane Roe" soon after the decision's issuance and stated that she sought an abortion because she was unemployable and greatly depressed.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ravingatheist.com/2009/01/trivia-question-answer |title = 'Jane Roe' Started Abortion Battle |work = The Raving Theist |date = January 17, 2009 |access-date = June 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, McCorvey asserted that she had been the "pawn" of two young and ambitious lawyers (Weddington and Coffee) who were looking for a [[plaintiff]] with whom they could challenge the [[Texas]] state law prohibiting abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Douglas S. |last = Wood  |date= June 18, 2003 |url = http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/01/21/mccorvey.interview/ |publisher = CNN |title = Who is 'Jane Roe'? |access-date = February 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books and conversion==
In her first book, the 1994 [[autobiography]], ''I Am Roe'', McCorvey wrote of her sexual orientation. For many years, she had lived quietly in Dallas with her long-time partner, Connie Gonzales. "We're not like other lesbians, going to bars," she explained in a ''[[New York Times]]'' interview. "We're lesbians together. We're homers."&lt;ref name="Norma McCorvey" /&gt; That same year, she became a [[Christianity|Christian]] and voiced remorse for her part in the Supreme Court decision. McCorvey worked as part of the [[pro-life]] movement, such as [[Operation Save America|Operation Rescue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.excerptsofinri.com/roe_v_wade.html|title=Roe V Wade - Norma McCorvey|website=www.excerptsofinri.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a signing of ''I Am Roe'', McCorvey was befriended by [[evangelical]] minister and National Director of Operation Rescue [[Flip Benham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1 = Joe |last1 = Maxwell |first2 = Roy |last2 = Maynard |date= August 26 – September 2, 1995 |volume= 10  |issue = 15 |work = The Forerunner |url = http://www.forerunner.com/fyi/roewades.html |title = Miss Norma &amp; Her Baby: Two Victims Who Got Away |access-date = February 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later baptized on August 8, 1995, by Benham, in a Dallas, Texas, backyard swimming pool, an event that was filmed for national television. Two days later she announced that she had quit her job at the abortion clinic she was working at, and had become an advocate of Operation Rescue's campaign to make abortion illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McCorvey|Thomas|1997|page=|ps=.}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCorvey's second book, ''Won by Love'', was published in 1998. She explained her change on the stance of abortion with the following comments:

{{Quote|I was sitting in O.R.'s offices when I noticed a fetal development poster. The progression was so obvious, the eyes were so sweet. It hurt my heart, just looking at them. I ran outside and finally, it dawned on me. 'Norma', I said to myself, 'They're right'. I had worked with pregnant women for years. I had been through three pregnancies and deliveries myself. I should have known. Yet something in that poster made me lose my breath. I kept seeing the picture of that tiny, 10-week-old [[embryo]], and I said to myself, that's a baby! It's as if blinders just fell off my eyes and I suddenly understood the truth—that's a baby!

I felt crushed under the truth of this realization. I had to face up to the awful reality. Abortion wasn't about 'products of conception'. It wasn't about 'missed periods'. It was about children being killed in their mother's wombs. All those years I was wrong. Signing that [[affidavit]], I was wrong. Working in an abortion clinic, I was wrong. No more of this first trimester, second trimester, third trimester stuff. Abortion—at any point—was wrong. It was so clear. Painfully clear.&lt;ref name="Roe v. McCorvey"&gt;{{cite web |last = McCorvey |first = Norma |last2 = Thomas |first2 = Gary |last-author-amp = yes |date = January 1998 |url = http://www.leaderu.com/common/roev.html |title = Roe v. McCorvey |work = Leadership U |access-date = February 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shortly thereafter, McCorvey released a statement that affirmed her reception into the [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]], and she was [[Confirmation (Catholicism)|Confirmed]] as a full member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.priestsforlife.org/testimony/normamaster.htm |publisher = [[Priests for Life]] |title = Norma McCorvey's Ministry }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="priestsforlife.org"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.priestsforlife.org/columns/conversionofnorma.html |title = The Conversion of Norma McCorvey |first = Frank |last = Pavone |publisher = Priests for Life |year = 2013 |accessdate = June 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life, McCorvey stated that she was [[ex-gay|no longer a lesbian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-fascinating-story-of-the-woman-at-the-center-of-roe-v-wade_us_569fe850e4b0d8cc1098772b |work = [[The Huffington Post]] |date = January 21, 1996 |title = The Fascinating Story Of The Woman At The Center Of Roe v. Wade|first = Jenavieve |last = Hatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 17, 1998, she was received into the Roman Catholic church by Father [[Frank Pavone]], the International Director of [[Priests for Life]] and Father Edward Robinson in Dallas.&lt;ref name="priestsforlife.org"/&gt;

==Social, political, and religious causes==
In February 2005, McCorvey petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn the 1973 decision with ''[[McCorvey v. Hill]]'', arguing that she had standing to do so as one of the original litigants and that the case should be heard once again in light of what she claimed was evidence that the procedure harms women, but the petition was denied, because the Supreme Court considered the matter to be [[mootness|moot]].

On January 22, 2008, McCorvey endorsed [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]]. McCorvey stated, "I support Ron Paul for president because we share the same goal, that of overturning ''Roe v. Wade''. He has never wavered on the issue of being [[pro-life]] and has a voting record to prove it. He understands the importance of [[civil liberties]] for all, including the unborn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2008/01/22/4433288-jane-roe-endorses-paul?lite |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120926185037/http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2008/01/22/4433288-jane-roe-endorses-paul?lite |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2012-09-26 |title = 'Jane Roe' Endorses Paul |publisher = MSNBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCorvey remained active in pro-life demonstrations, including one she participated in before President [[Barack Obama]]'s commencement address to the graduates of the [[University of Notre Dame]] (the decision to invite the President to speak at the university on May 17, 2009 was controversial because his views on abortion conflicted with the teachings of the [[Catholic Church]], with which the University is affiliated). McCorvey was arrested on the first day of [[Sonia Sotomayor Supreme Court nomination|U.S. Senate hearings for the confirmation]] of the presidential nomination to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] of [[Sonia Sotomayor]], after McCorvey and another protester began shouting during Senator [[Al Franken]]'s opening statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Paul |last = Kane |date = July 13, 2009 |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/13/AR2009071302345.html?hpid=topnews |title = 'Jane Roe' Arrested at Supreme Court Hearing |work = [[The Washington Post]] |access-date = February 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Lake of Fire (film)|Lake of Fire]]'', a 2006 pro-choice documentary by [[Tony Kaye (director)|Tony Kaye]] on the abortion controversy in the United States, features McCorvey discussing her involvement in ''Roe v. Wade'' and her subsequent conversion to Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlson|first1=Michael|title=Norma McCorvey obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/19/norma-mccorvey-obituary|accessdate=24 February 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tobias|first1=Scott|title=Lake Of Fire|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/lake-of-fire-3261|accessdate=24 February 2017|work=[[The A.V.

McCorvey made her acting debut in ''[[Doonby]]'', shot on location in 2010 in the small central [[Texas]] town of [[Smithville, Texas|Smithville]]. Starring [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]], [[Jenn Gotzon]] and [[Robert Davi]], the film previewed at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]] and was released in late 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woman-at-center-roe-v-184611 |title = Woman at Center of ''Roe v.

==Death==
McCorvey died of heart failure in [[Katy, Texas]], on February 18, 2017, at the age of 69.&lt;ref name="New York Times 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post 2017" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">'''Numonius Vala''' was a combination of family name ''([[Roman naming conventions|nomen]])'' and ''[[cognomen]]'' used by [[ancient Romans|ancient Roman men]] of the ''[[Numonia (gens)|gens Numonia]]''.

==Gaius Numonius Vala==
[[Image:C. Numonius Vala coin.png|thumb|250px|Coin depicting Numonius storming the vallum.]]
Gaius Numonius Vala is known only from coins, from which it appears that he had obtained renown by storming a [[vallum]], and had hence obtained the surname of Vala, which, according to the usual custom, became hereditary in his family. The coins were struck by one of his descendants in commemoration of the exploit. The one pictured here has on the obverse the head of Numonius, with the inscription ''C. NVMONIVS VAALA'', and on the reverse a man storming the vallum of a camp, which is defended by two others, with the inscription ''VAALA''. Vaala is an ancient form of Vala, just as on the coins of Sulla we find ''Feelix'' instead of ''Felix''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Hilarius Eckhel|Eckhel]], vol. v. p. 263. (cited in Smith)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numonius Vala of the Epistles==
Numonius Vala, to whom [[Horace]] addresses one of his [[Epistles]] (i. 15), appears to have had estates in the neighbourhood of [[Velia]] and [[Salernum]], since the poet makes inquiries of Vala about the climate of those places, as he intended to pass the winter in one of them. As this poem was probably written about 22 BC, the friend of Horace was most likely the father of the Numonius Vala below, if not the same person.

==Numonius Vala, legate==
Numonius Vala was a [[legatus|legate]] of [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] in 9 AD. He left the infantry when they were attacked by the enemy in the fatal [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] and fled with the cavalry to the [[Rhine]], but was overtaken in his flight and slain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Velleius Paterculus|Veil. Pat.]] ii. 119. (cited in Smith)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmentalism===
After leaving the ''International Herald Tribune'', Goldmark became program director for climate and air at the Environmental Defense Foundation (EDF), where he worked on projects in India, Mexico, Brazil, China, and United States. He was a strong advocate for [[sustainable development]], noting the interplay of [[global climate change]], financing, technologies and the institutions, including foundations, that can address these factors.&lt;ref name="Bellagio"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Upon retiring from the EDF in 2010, he expressed disappointment that his generation had failed to solve the world's environmental issues. He was especially concerned about the lack of action within the U.S. government and held hope that other governments of populous countries might realize the need for action before effects like [[global warming]] become irreversible.&lt;ref name="Retired"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and legacy==
On four occasions from 1981 to  1994, Goldmark was designated one of the "Young Leaders" selected by the [[French-American Foundation]], which matches French and American "up-and-coming leaders" in various walks of life and brings them together for five days of discussions on topics of common interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frenchamerican.org/youngleadersclasses|title=Young Leaders|publisher=[[French-American Foundation]]|accessdate=2015-10-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103095655/http://frenchamerican.org/youngleadersclasses|archivedate=2015-11-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldmark received the [[Wilson Wyatt]] National Award for Urban Revitalization and became a member of the French [[Legion of Honor]]. He has been a visiting professor at noted schools, including the  [[JFK School of Government]] of [[Harvard University]], [[Yale University]], [[Brandeis University]] and the [[Woodrow Wilson School]] of [[Princeton University]].

'''Protais Mpiranya''' (born 1960)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virungavision.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=965:vient-de-paraitre-rwanda-le-paradis-perdu&amp;catid=38:publications-recentes-sur-lafrique-des-grands-lac&amp;Itemid=54]&lt;/ref&gt; is a Rwandan soldier, who is alleged to have participated in the [[Rwandan Genocide]].

== Background and role in genocide ==

An ethnic [[Hutu]], Mpiranya was born in [[Gitarama Province|Gitarama]] prefecture. In 1993, he held the rank of major in the [[Rwandan Armed Forces]] and was second-in-command of military operations and intelligence (S2 and S3) in the Presidential Guard Battalion. Later the same year, he was appointed Commander of the Presidential Guard Battalion.&lt;ref name="ictr-indictment"&gt;[http://65.18.216.88/ENGLISH/cases/Mpiranya/ Indictment against Mpiranya]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, from the ICTR&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICTR indictment alleges that between 1990 and 1994, Mpiranya and other officers [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspired]] to exterminate the [[Tutsi]] civilians and political opponents, and helped to train ''[[interahamwe]]'' and [[militia]] groups who committed the genocide.&lt;ref name="ictr-indictment" /&gt;

On 5 January 1994, the day that the Broad-Based Transitional Government specified by the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] was to be sworn in, Mpiranya prevented the access of political opponents onto the premises of the ''Conseil national de développement'', particularly [[Lando Ndasingwa]] and his [[Liberal Party (Rwanda)|Liberal Party]]. This had the result that the only member of the Transitional Government who had been sworn in was President [[Juvénal Habyarimana|Habyarimana]].&lt;ref name="ictr-indictment" /&gt;

After Habyarimana's death and the start of the genocide, members of the Presidential Guard presumedly led by Mpiranya{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} "tracked down, arrested and killed" Rwandan Prime Minister [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]]. They also took into custody 10 Belgian peacekeepers from [[UNAMIR]] who had been guarding her house, who were later gruesomely killed.&lt;ref&gt;[Scott Peterson: ''Me against my brother''. New York, Routledge, 2002,  p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; They were accompanied in this by members of the Para-Commando Battalion and the A company of the Reconnaissance Battalion, led by Captain [[Innocent Sagahutu]].&lt;ref name="ictr-indictment" /&gt;

Simultaneously, other members of the presidential guard and other army units undertook similar actions against other opposition figures.&lt;ref name="ictr-indictment" /&gt;

On the morning of 7 April, Mpiranya was told by members of the Presidential Guard that [[Faustin Rucogoza]], the Minister of Information, and his wife were presently being detained at the Presidential Guard camp. He allegedly responded by asking his soldiers why they were keeping them. Shortly afterwards, both were killed in the camp.&lt;ref name="ictr-indictment" /&gt;

== After the genocide ==
Mpiranya fled Rwanda after the [[Rwandese Patriotic Front|RPF]] victory.

In an indictment amended on 25 September 2002, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) charged Mpiranya with "conspiracy to commit [[genocide]], genocide, [[crimes against humanity]], and violations of the [[Geneva Convention]]."&lt;ref name="ictr-indictment" /&gt;

For several years Mpiranya was still at large and believed to be with other Rwandan émigrés in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] or in [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zwnews.com/issuefull.cfm?ArticleID=19154 |title=Mercenaries join Mugabe's ruthless terror campaign |work=ZW News |date=15 July 2008 |access-date=15 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080715225041/http://zwnews.com/issuefull.cfm?ArticleID=19154 |archive-date=15 July 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2002, Mpiranya was indicted by the U.N.'s [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR). He was charged with [[genocide]], conspiracy to commit genocide, complicity in genocide, [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crimes]]. Mpiranya remained at large and was one of the most wanted men by the Tribunal.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/10/445.html "The Hague Justice Portal – Mpiranya, Protais"]&lt;/ref&gt; The US government put a prize on his head in the [[Rewards for Justice Program]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rewardsforjustice.net/ "Rewards for Justice"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dssrewards.net/protais-mpiranya/ "Protais Mpiranya – Wanted Up to $5 Million Reward"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shelter in Zimbabwe ==

In February 2010, Mpiranya was reported by Belgian authorities to be sheltered by the Zimbabwean government, operating businesses in Harare, on top of acting as [[mercenary]] for the ruling party [[ZANU-PF]] to silence the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201002030876.html "Rwanda: Top Genocide Suspect Finds Sanctuary in Zimbabwe"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/zimbabwe-shelters-genocide-leader/story-e6frg6so-1111116573932 "Protais Mpiranya accused of links with Robert Mugabe"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimbabwesituation.org/?p=7701 "Top Genocide suspect finds sanctuary in Zimbabwe"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, Rwanda appealed for United Nations intervention in its diplomatic row after the Zimbabwean government refused to extradite Protais Mpiranya to the ICTR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.radiovop.com/index.php/national-news/4385.html "Rwanda Wants UN To Act On Zimbabwe"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715150146/http://news.radiovop.com/index.php/national-news/4385.html |date=15 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mpiranya allegedly stayed in [[Norton, Zimbabwe|Norton]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezimbabwemail.com/zimbabwe/5888.html "Rwandan genocide fugitive spotted in Norton"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818080743/http://www.thezimbabwemail.com/zimbabwe/5888.html |date=18 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.radiovop.com/index.php/national-news/4369.html "Rwandan Genocide Fugitive Located In Norton"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820145627/http://news.radiovop.com/index.php/national-news/4369.html |date=20 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about 40&amp;nbsp;km west of the capital [[Harare]], where he allegedly stayed since his arrival in Zimbabwe in 2001. Security sources said that the Harare authorities were not keen on giving up the fugitive to whom they feel indebted over his reconnaissance role during the 1998–2001 Democratic Republic of Congo civil war. Mpiranya was instrumental during the DRC war after he worked side by side with southern African Allied forces, which included Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia. He is believed to have supplied strategic information about the Rwandan military and also mobilised and trained Rwandans in refugee camps in eastern DRC to fight against the Rwandan army. Rwanda's Prosecutor General [[Martin Ngoga]] said the International Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda (ICTR) should move and bring Proitas Mpiranya to book. The two nations backed opposite sides in the DRC war. The row escalated after Zimbabwe accused Rwandan secret agents of illegally entering the country in pursuit of Mpiranya. Kigali denied the allegations, saying it would follow proper procedures to seek the extradition of Mpiranya. This was the second time that Zimbabwe has refused to extradite African officials accused of genocide in their own countries. It has refused to hand over former Ethiopian dictator [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] who is wanted in his country for mass murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezimbabwean.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33637:rwanda-calls-on-un-as-row-with-zim-escalates&amp;catid=39&amp;Itemid=30 "Rwanda calls on UN as row with Zim escalates"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a Zimbabwean official denying he was in the country in 2011, Zimbabwe's police announced in September 2012 that they have commenced a manhunt for Mpiranya. The UN's war crimes tribunal on Rwanda offered a USD5 million for his capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Ramón Corral Verdugo''' (January 10, 1854 – November 10, 1912) was the [[Vice President]] of [[Mexico]] under [[Porfirio Díaz]] from 1904 until their resignations in May 1911.

==Early life==

[[File:Cajemé.jpg|thumb|right|Yaqui leader José Maria Bonifacio Leiva Perez, [[Cajemé]], who Corral interviewed following his capture]]
Corral was born '''Ramón Corral Verdugo''' on Hacienda Las Mercedes (where his father worked as an administrator),&lt;ref&gt;''The American Review of Reviews. Vol. 42, No. 6, December, 1910, (Albert Shaw, Ed.), pp.730-731 ''&lt;/ref&gt; near the city of [[Alamos, Sonora|Álamos]], [[Sonora]], on 10 January 1854 to Fulgencio Fabián Corral Rochín&lt;ref&gt;Fulgencio Corral's full name, documented at his christening. ''Registros parroquiales  Bautismos 1829-1838. Alamos, Sonora, 1696-1968  Iglesia Católica. Purísima Concepción ''&lt;/ref&gt;  (January, 1834–1868) and María Francisca Almada y Verdugo (1836-). He was christened on 21 January 1854 at the Purísima Concepción [[Roman Catholic Church in Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;''Registros parroquiales : Bautismos 1838-1856. Alamos, Sonora, 1696-1968  Iglesia Católica. Purísima Concepción ''&lt;/ref&gt; His recorded paternal baptismal surname was ''Corrales'', however the surname ''Corral'' is commonly used. 
[[File:Ramon Corrales Baptism 1854.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Image of Ramon Corral's baptism registration from 21 January 1854]]
Ramón Corral first gained public attention in 1872, when General Don Ignacio L. Pesqueira, Governor of the State of [[Sonora]], an undefeated general who had provided many services to his state, created public outrage when he introduced state constitutional reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bancroft |first= Hubert Howe |date=1889 |title=History of the North Mexican States and Texas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rgh1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA702&amp;dq=Pesqueira+1872+constitution+sonora&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf_73Hl4TeAhUOq1kKHbqYBUMQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=San Francisco, California |publisher=The History Company |page=702 |volume=2|author-link=Hubert_Howe_Bancroft |access-date=September 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid compliance with a law, Pesqueira introduced, among other reforms, a ban on re-election governor. The young Corral vigorously fought against the Pesqueira administration through the press, founding the newspapers ''El Fantasma'' ("The Phantom"), and ''La Voz de Álamos'' ("The Voice of Álamos"). His writings in the papers exhibited civil valor, love for [[democracy]], and power as a political adversary of the Pesqueira administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |date=September 1904 |title=Ramon Corral: A President in Reserve for Mexico |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o24AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1223&amp;lpg=PA1223&amp;dq=el+fantasma+corral&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RICTYtbQeV&amp;sig=cqSFEvTgVFuPcNLsOS674gIODwU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiI6OHNmoTeAhWnT98KHVtcC0EQ6AEwFHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |journal=The World To-day: A Monthly Record of Human Progress |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=1222-1224 |access-date=September 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, Corral increasingly became involved in politics.

While General Secretary of the Government of Sonora, Corral was involved with the capture of the indigenous [[Yaqui]] military leader José Maria Leiva, known as [[Cajemé]]. In ''La Constitución'' (Periódico oficial del gobierno del estado libre y soberano de Sonora), beginning with the issue of April 22, 1887, and ending July 8, 1887, Corral published biographical notes about Cajemé, which were recorded only a few days earlier during personal talks with the captured Yaqui.  Cajemé was being held at the time in the house of the military chief of the area, Angel Martínez, who had personally arrested him while Cajemé was hiding in San Jose de [[Guaymas]].

Corral married Amparo V. Escalante on February 25, 1888. She was the daughter of Vicente Escalante, a well-known Mexican statesman of the time. The religious element of the twofold marriage ceremony was performed by Father Ortega of [[Hermosillo]], with a civil ceremony performed by Civil Judge Bonito Méndez, of the Hermosillo District.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1888/03/09/103166847.pdf ''A Wedding in Mexico''. The New York Times, 1888]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''La Constitucíon''. March 2, 1888. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Corral was one of the  ''[[científico|científicos]]'' who advised [[Mexican   President]] [[Porfirio Díaz]]. Corral served as [[Secretary of State (Mexico) | Secretary of State]] from 1891 to 1895. He became Governor of the [[Federal District of Mexico]] in 1900 and was sworn in as [[Minister of the Interior]] in the cabinet of Díaz in 1903. He became vice-president in 1904 and was re-elected in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Garner, ''Porfirio Díaz''. New York: Pearson 2001, pp. 253-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
[[File:Ramon Corral and family.jpg|thumb|Ramón Corral and his family.]]
Corral traveled with his family to [Paris]] for medical care, where he was diagnosed with cancer. After his operation, the cancer was found to be incurable. In light of his own deteriorating health and the increasing [[Mexican Revolution|revolutionary opposition]] to the Díaz government, Corral submitted his resignation, dated May 10, 1911, to [[Francisco León de la Barra]], Díaz’s foreign secretary, which de la Barra held until Díaz submitted his own "Renuncia" on May 25, 1911.&lt;ref&gt;O'Shaughnessy, Edith. (1920). [https://books.google.com/books?id=LzB6AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22ramon+corral%22+death+paris&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ramon%20corral%22%20&amp;f=false ''Intimate pages of Mexican history.''] pp.101-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Letter of Resignation''===

Corral's letter of resignation gave no doubt that he had foreknowledge of Díaz's intention to resign, and that the course of events would lead to a new government for Mexico:

''On the two occasions that the national convention advanced my candidacy as Vice-President of the republic, to figure in the elections with Gen. Diaz as President, I stated that I was prepared to occupy any office in which compatriots considered that I would be of use, and that if the public vote conferred upon me a position so far above my merits, then my intention would be to second in all respects Gen. Diaz's policy, in order to co-operate with him, as far as it lay in my power, toward the aggrandizement of the nation, which had developed so notably under his administration.''

''Those who concern themselves with public affairs and have observed their progress during the last few years will be able to say whether I have complied with my intention.''

''For my part, I can say that I have never endeavored to bring about the least obstacle either in the President's policy or his manner of carrying it out even at the cost of sacrificing my convictions, both because this was the basis of my programme and because this corresponded to my position and my loyalty, as well as that I did not seek any prestige in the office of Vice-President, so useful in the United States and so discredited in Latin countries.''

''In the events which have shaken the country during these latter months, the President has been brought to consider that it is patriotic to resign from the high office that the almost unanimous vote of Mexicans had conferred upon him in the last election, and that it is advisable at the same time, in the interest of the country, that the Vice-President do likewise, so that new men and new energies should continue forwarding the prosperity of the nation.''

''Following my program of seconding Gen. Diaz's policy, I join my resignation with his and in the present note I retire from the office of Vice-President of the republic, begging the chamber to accept the same at the same time as that of the President.''

''I beg of you gentlemen to inform yourselves of the above, which I submit with the protests of my highest consideration.''

''Liberty and Constitution, Paris, May 4, 1911.''

===Death===
Corral died of cancer in [[Paris]] on 10 November 1912, surrounded by family members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/11/11/100380622.pdf ''Ramon Corral Dead'' from ''The New York Times'', 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rebecca Blake Eames''' (February 1, 1641 - May 8, 1721) was among those accused of [[witchcraft]] during the [[Salem witch trials]] of 1692.

Rebecca Eames was in the crowd at the August 19, 1692, hanging of witches in Salem when she was accused of causing a pinprick in the foot of another spectator. She was arrested. Eames later testified that the devil had appeared to her as a colt and had persuaded her to follow him. She testified that she had allowed her son Daniel (born 1663) to be baptized by the devil. She confessed to afflicting Timothy Swan.

She was examined again on August 31, 1692 by [[John Hathorne]] and [[Jonathan Corwin]]. She repeated her confession and implication of her son Daniel as a wizard and her confession of afflicting Timothy Swan. She also implicated "Toothaker Widow" [Margaret Toothaker] and Abigail Faulkner as fellow witches.

Mary Walcott, Mary Warren and Ann Putnam Jr. gave testimony on September 15 that they had been afflicted by Rebecca Eames. She was tried and convicted on September 17, with nine others. They were all condemned to die. Four of those nine were executed on September 22. In October, the Court of Oyer and Terminer was dissolved. Rebecca Eames remained in Salem prison. On December 5, she submitted a petition to Governor Phips retracting her "false and untrue" confession, saying she had been "hurried out of my Senses" by Abigail Hobbs and Mary Lacey who had said she would be hanged if she did not confess. Her husband, Robert Eames, died on July 22, 1693, four months after his wife's release from prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenshistory.about.com/od/salempeople/a/Rebecca-Eames.htm Biography], womenshistory.about.com; accessed September 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Pantaleon''' ({{lang-el|Παντελεήμων}}, {{lang-ru|Пантелеи́мон|translit=Panteleímon}}; "all-compassionate"), counted in the West among the late-medieval [[Fourteen Holy Helpers]] and in the East as one of the [[Holy Unmercenary Healers]], was a [[martyr]] of [[Nicomedia]] in [[Bithynia]] during  the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] of 305 AD.

Though there is evidence to suggest that a martyr named Pantaleon existed, some consider the stories of his life and death to be purely legendary.&lt;ref name="Alban"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Butler | first = Alban  | authorlink = Alban Butler | title = Butler's Lives of the Saints | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | year = 2000 | page = 217 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PBGzh1JK2gUC&amp;pg=PA217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life of Pantaleon==
According to the [[martyrology|martyrologies]], Pantaleon was the son of a rich pagan, Eustorgius of Nicomedia, and had been instructed in Christianity by his Christian mother, Saint Eubula; however, after her death he fell away from the Christian church, while he studied medicine with a renowned physician Euphrosinos; under the patronage of Euphrosinos he became physician to the emperor, [[Galerius]].&lt;ref name="Alban"/&gt;

[[Image:Spb 06-2012 Pantaleon Church.jpg|thumb|Church of St. Panteleimon, built in 1735-1739, is one of the oldest in [[St. Petersburg]]]]
He was won back to Christianity by Saint Hermolaus (characterized as a bishop of the church at Nicomedia in the later literature), who convinced him that [[Christ]] was the better physician, signalling the significance of the ''[[exemplum]]'' of Pantaleon that faith is to be trusted over medical advice.

[[Alphonsus Maria de Liguori|St. Alphonsus Liguori]] wrote regarding this incident:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He studied medicine with such success, that the Emperor Maximian appointed him his physician. One day as our saint was discoursing with a holy priest named Hermolaus, the latter, after praising the study of medicine, concluded thus: "But, my friend, of what use are all thy acquirements in this art, since thou art ignorant of the science of salvation?&lt;ref name="liguori"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Liguori | first = Alphonsus  | title = Victories of the Martyrs | chapter = SS. Hermolaus, Priest; and Pantaleon, Physician | publisher = Benziger Brothers  | year = 1888  | location = London | pages = 308–311  | url = https://archive.org/stream/victoriesmartyrs09liguuoft#page/n313/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By miraculously healing a blind man by invoking the name of Jesus over him, Pantaleon converted his father, upon whose death he came into possession of a large fortune. He freed his slaves and, distributing his wealth among the poor, developed a great reputation in Nicomedia. Envious colleagues denounced him to the emperor during the [[Diocletian]] persecution. The emperor wished to save him and sought to persuade him to [[apostasy]]. Pantaleon, however, openly confessed his faith, and as proof that Christ was the true God, he healed a paralytic. Notwithstanding this, he was condemned to death by the emperor, who regarded the [[miracle]] as an exhibition of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]].&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt;

According to the legend, Pantaleon's flesh was first burned with torches, whereupon Christ appeared to all in the form of Hermolaus to strengthen and heal Pantaleon. The torches were extinguished. Then a bath of molten lead was prepared; when the apparition of Christ stepped into the cauldron with him, the fire went out and the lead became cold. Pantaleon was now thrown into the sea, loaded with a great stone, which floated. He was thrown to  wild beasts, but these fawned upon him and could not be forced away until he had blessed them. He was bound on the wheel, but the ropes snapped, and the wheel broke. An attempt was made to behead him, but the sword bent, and the executioners were converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name="cathen"/&gt;

Pantaleon implored Heaven to forgive them, for which reason he also received the name of ''Panteleimon'' ("mercy for everyone" or "all-compassionate"). It was not until he himself desired it that it was possible to behead him, upon which there issued forth blood and a white liquid like milk.

St. Alphonsus wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At [[Ravello]], a city in the kingdom of Naples, there is a vial of his blood, which becomes blood every year [on his feastday], and may be seen in this state interspersed with the milk, as I, the author of this work, have seen it.&lt;ref name="liguori"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early veneration==
The ''[[hagiography|vitae]]'' containing these miraculous features are all late in date and "valueless" according to the ''Catholic Encyclopedia''.&lt;ref name="cathen"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Löffler | first = Klemens |title = St. Pantaleon | encyclopedia = The Catholic Encyclopedia | volume = 11 | publisher = Robert Appleton Company | year = 1911 | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11447a.htm | accessdate = 8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the fact of his martyrdom itself seems to be supported by a veneration for which there is testimony in the 5th century, among others in a sermon on the martyrs by [[Theodoret]] (died c. 457);&lt;ref&gt;''Graecarum affectionum curatio'', Sermo VIII, "De martyribus", published in [[Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', LXXXIII 1033&lt;/ref&gt; [[Procopius of Caesarea]] (died c. 565?), writing on the churches and shrines constructed by [[Justinian I]]&lt;ref&gt;''De aedificiis Justiniani'' (I, ix; V, ix)&lt;/ref&gt; tells that the emperor rebuilt the shrine to Pantaleon at Nicomedia; and there is mention of Pantaleon in the ''[[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bollandists]]' ''Acta Sanctorum'' for November, II, 1, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration in the East==
[[Image:Byzantine - Saint Panteleimon - Walters 4820864.jpg|thumb|Panteleimon, is shown here with a lancet in his right hand.  This tile probably formed a frieze on a church wall or altar screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]] |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/26666 |title=  Saint Panteleimon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Walters Art Museum]].]]

The Eastern tradition concerning Pantaleon follows more or less the medieval Western hagiography, but lacks any mention of a visible apparition of Christ. It states instead that Hermolaus was still alive while Pantaleon's torture was under way, but was martyred himself only shortly before Pantaleon's beheading along with two companions, Hermippas and Thermocrates.  The saint is canonically depicted as a beardless young man with a full head of curly hair.

Pantaleon's [[relic]]s, venerated at Nicomedia, were transferred to [[Constantinople]].  Numerous churches, shrines, and monasteries have been named for him; in the West most often as St. Pantaleon and in the East as St. Panteleimon; to him is consecrated the [[Rossikon|St. Panteleimon Monastery]] at [[Mount Athos]], [[St. Panteleimon Monastery (Myrtou)|St Panteleimon monastery]] in [[Myrtou]], Cyprus, and the 12th-century [[Church of St. Panteleimon (Nerezi)|Church of St. Panteleimon]] in [[Gorno Nerezi]], [[Republic of Macedonia]].

Armenians believe that the Gandzasar Monastery in [[Nagorno Karabakh]] contains relics of St. Pantaleon, who was venerated in eastern provinces of [[Armenia]].

==Veneration in Western Europe==
At the [[Basilica of the Vierzehnheiligen]] near [[Staffelstein]] in [[Franconia]], St. Pantaleon is venerated with his hands nailed to his head, reflecting another legend about his death.

After the [[Black Death]] of the mid-14th century in Western Europe, as a [[patron saint]] of physicians and midwives, he came to be regarded as one of the fourteen guardian martyrs, the [[Fourteen Holy Helpers]]. Relics of the saint are found at [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint Denis]] at Paris; his head is venerated at Lyon. A [[Church of St. Pantaleon|Romanesque church]] was dedicated to him in [[Cologne]] in the 9th century at the latest.

===England===
In the [[British Library]] there is a surviving manuscript, written in Saxon Old English, of ''The Life of St Pantaleon'' (British Library, MS Cotton Vitellius D XVII), dating from the early eleventh century, possibly written for Abbot [[Ælfric of Eynsham]].&lt;ref&gt;Joana Proud, 'The Old English 'Life of Saint Pantaleon' and its manuscript context' in ''Bulletin of the John Rylands Library'' (1997, vol. 79, no. 3, pp.119-132&lt;/ref&gt; The Canons' Vestry off the south transept of [[Chichester Cathedral]] was formerly a square-plan chapel dedicated to Saint Pantaleon - it was possibly under construction just before the cathedral's great fire of 1187.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/sussex/vol3/pp105-113|title=Chichester cathedral: Historical survey - British History Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In France, he was depicted in a window in [[Chartres Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="Alban"/&gt;  In southern France there are six [[commune in France|communes]] under the protective name of Saint-Pantaléon. Though there are individual churches consecrated to him elsewhere, there are no communes named for him in the north or northwest of France. The six are:

* [[Saint-Pantaléon, Lot|Saint-Pantaléon]], in the [[Lot (department)|Lot]] ''[[département in France|département]]'', [[Midi-Pyrénées]]
* [[Saint-Pantaléon, Vaucluse|Saint-Pantaléon]], in the [[Vaucluse]] ''département'', [[Provence]] - a wine-growing village
* [[Saint-Pantaléon-de-Lapleau]], in the [[Corrèze]] ''département'', [[Limousin (région)|Limousin]]
* [[Saint-Pantaléon-de-Larche]], in the [[Corrèze]] ''département'', at the border of [[Périgord]] and [[Quercy]]
* [[Saint-Pantaléon-les-Vignes]], in the [[Drôme]] ''département'', [[Rhône-Alpes]] – a wine-growing village&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cave-st-pantaleon.com&lt;/ref&gt; that is part of the [[Côtes du Rhône]] vinyard region
* Saint-Pantaléon, in the [[Saône-et-Loire]] ''département'', [[Bourgogne]] – administratively linked to [[Autun]], bishopric see

===Germany===
In Cologne a 10th Century [[Romanesque church]], partly built by the daughter of the Byzantine emperor, [[Theophanu]], who married the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto II]] in 972
* [[St. Pantaleon's Church, Cologne|Saint Pantaleon]], in [[Cologne]]

===Italy===
In Italy, Pantaleon gives favourable lottery numbers, victories and winners in dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Jockle | first = Clemens | title = Encyclopedia of Saints | publisher = Alpine Fine Arts Collection | year = 1995 | location = London | page = 349}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A phial containing some of his blood was long preserved at [[Ravello]].&lt;ref name="Alban"/&gt;  On the feast day of the saint, the blood was said to become fluid and to bubble (compare [[Saint Januarius]]). [[Paolo Veronese|Paolo Veronese's]] painting of Pantaleon can be found in the church of [[San Pantalon]] in [[Venice]]; it shows the saint healing a child.  Another painting of Pantaleon by [[Fumiani]] is also in the same church.&lt;ref name="Alban"/&gt;  He was depicted in an 8th-century fresco in [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] in [[Rome]], and in a 10th-century cycle of pictures in the crypt of [[San Crisogono]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="Alban"/&gt; In Calabria, there is a small town named Papanice, after Pantaleon. Each year on his feast day, a statue of the saint is carried through the town to give a blessing for all those who seek it.

San Pantaleone or Pantalone was a popular saint in Venice, and he therefore gave his name to a character in the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'', [[Pantalone]], a silly, wizened old man ([[Shakespeare]]'s "lean and slippered Pantaloon") who was a caricature of Venetians. This character was portrayed as wearing trousers rather than knee breeches, and so became the origin of the name of a type of trouser called "[[Trousers|pantaloons]]," which was later shortened to "pants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=Pantaloon|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=pantaloons&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|website=Etymology Online|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===
Saint Pantaleon ''(São Pantalião'' in Portuguese) is one of the patron saints of the city of [[Porto]] in [[Portugal]]&lt;ref name="Anglo-American"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pt/books?id=WalsJlc_MDMC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;lpg=PA392&amp;dq=st+pantaleon+patron+saint+porto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3pPv9jbLRl&amp;sig=rT9vCI5yoXGf9Cqe55QRhb0Oa7I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiYp5iil-bdAhVPyYUKHXDJDT4Q6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=st%20pantaleon%20patron%20saint%20porto&amp;f=false|title=The Anglo-American, a journal of literature, news, politics, the drama, fine arts, etc.|last=Patterson|first=A.D.|date=1846|publisher=E.L.

Pedro de Miragaia, to the Cathedral }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eponym==
* Portuguese explorer [[Bartolomeu Dias]], the first European known to have sailed around the [[Cape of Good Hope]], took a ship named ''São Pantaleão'' on that expedition.
* The Russian battleship [[Russian battleship Potemkin|''Potemkin'']] was renamed ''Panteleimon'' after her recovery after the [[mutiny]] of 1905 
* St. Pantaleon is the eponym of the character [[Pantalaimon]] in [[Philip Pullman]]'s [[His Dark Materials]] series of novels

'''Sir Nicholas Colthurst, 3rd Baronet''' (died July 1795) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] member of the [[Irish House of Commons]] for [[St Johnstown (County Longford) (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|St Johnstown]] in 1783–1790 and [[Clonakilty (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Clonakilty]] in 1792–1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ancestryireland.com/family-records/biographies-of-the-members-of-the-irish-parliament/?search1=Nicholas&amp;search2=Colthurst&amp;search3=&amp;submit=Search|title= Biographies of Members of the Irish Parliament 1692-1800|publisher= Ulster Historical Foundation|accessdate = 31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Soong sisters.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The three Soong sisters together]]
The '''Soong sisters''' ({{zh|t=宋家姐妹|s=宋氏三姐妹|p=Sòngjiā Jiěmèi}}) were three [[Shanghainese people|Shanghainese]] (of [[Hainanese people|Hainanese]] descent) Chinese women who were, along with their husbands, amongst [[China]]'s most significant political figures of the early 20th century. They each played a major role in influencing their husbands, who, along with their own positions of power, ultimately changed the course of [[Chinese history]].

Their father was American-educated [[Methodism|Methodist]] minister [[Charlie Soong]], who made a fortune in banking and printing. Their mother was [[Ni Kwei-tseng]] (倪桂珍 ''Ní Guìzhēn''), whose mother, Lady Xu, was a descendant of [[Ming dynasty]] mathematician and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] convert [[Xu Guangqi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.editme.com/XuGuangqi|title=Catholic Dictionary entry for Xu Guangqi|accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three sisters attended [[Wesleyan College]] in Macon, Georgia, United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Soong Sisters|url=http://www.wesleyancollege.edu/About/HistoryoftheCollege/TheSoongSisters/tabid/135/Default.aspx|work=History of the College|accessdate=3 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927003637/http://www.wesleyancollege.edu/About/HistoryoftheCollege/TheSoongSisters/tabid/135/Default.aspx|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mei-ling, however, left Wesleyan and eventually graduated from [[Wellesley College]] in Massachusetts. Their three brothers were all high-ranking officials in the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] government, one of whom was [[T. V. Soong]].

==History==
[[Image:Soong sisters in their youth.jpg|thumb|The Soong sisters in their youth]]
Throughout their lifetimes, each one of the sisters followed her own beliefs in terms of supporting the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT; Nationalists) or the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]]. In the 1930s, [[Soong Ai-ling]] and [[Soong Mei-ling|Mei-ling]] were the two richest women in China;&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;Peterson, Barbara Bennett (ed.). (2000). ''Notable Women of China: Shang Dynasty to the Early 20th century''. M.E. Sharp publishing. {{ISBN|0-7656-0504-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; both of them supported the Nationalists.

In 1937, when the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]] broke out, all three of them got together after a 10-year separation in an effort to unite the KMT and CPC against the [[Imperial Japanese army]]. Soong Ai-ling devoted herself to social work such as helping wounded soldiers, refugees and orphans. She donated five ambulances and 37 trucks to the army in [[Shanghai]] and the air force, along with 500 leather uniforms.&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt;

[[Image:Soong Sisters visiting Nationalist soldiers.jpg|thumb|The sisters visiting female [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] soldiers]]
When the Japanese occupied [[Nanjing]] and [[Wuhan]], the three sisters moved to [[Hong Kong]]. In 1940, they returned to [[Chongqing]] and established the [[Chinese Industrial Cooperatives]], which opened job opportunities for people through weaving, sewing and other crafts. The sisters frequently visited schools, hospitals, orphanages, air raid shelters and aided war torn communities along the way.&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt; While both parties failed to unite at the most critical time in the 1940s, the sisters made a valiant effort in financing and assisting in all national activities.

'''The Younger Lady''' is the informal name given to a [[mummy]] discovered in the [[Egypt]]ian [[Valley of the Kings]], in tomb [[KV35]] by archaeologist [[Victor Loret]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Nicholas. Wilkinson, Richard H. &lt;cite&gt;The Complete Valley of the Kings&lt;/cite&gt;. p100. Thames &amp; Hudson. 1997. (Reprint) {{ISBN|0-500-05080-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mummy also has been given the designation KV35YL ("YL" for "Younger Lady") and 61072,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G. Eliot. &lt;cite&gt;The Royal Mummies&lt;/cite&gt; p.117 Duckworth Publishers, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and currently resides in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]]. Through recent DNA tests this mummy has been identified as the mother of the Pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]], and a daughter of Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]] and Queen [[Tiye]]. Early speculation was that this mummy was the remains of Queen [[Nefertiti]], which remains possible, but DNA tests have not confirmed this and questions about that possibility remain.&lt;ref name="pmid20159872" /&gt;

==Discovery and identification==
The mummy was found adjacent to two other mummies in KV35: a young boy who died at around the age of 10, thought to be [[Webensenu]], and another, older woman, identified as Queen [[Tiye]] by the recent DNA studies on Tutankhamun's lineage.&lt;ref name="pmid20159872"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; All were found together, lying naked side-by-side and unidentified in a small antechamber of the tomb. All three mummies had been extensively damaged by ancient tomb robbers.

There has been much speculation as to the identity of the Younger Lady mummy. Upon finding the mummy, Victor Loret initially believed it be that of a young man as the mummy's head had been shaved. A closer inspection later made by Dr. [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] confirmed that the mummy was that of a female, although Loret's original interpretation persisted for many years.

[[File:TheYoungerLady-61072-FrontView-PlateXCIX-TheRoyalMummies-1912.gif|thumbnail|right|The front view of the younger lady]]

Recently, [[autosomal]] and [[mitochondrial DNA]] tests have shown conclusively that the mummy is that of a female and that she was the mother of Tutankhamun.&lt;ref name="pmid20159872"/&gt; The results also show that she was a full-sister to her husband, the mummy from [[KV55]], and that they were both the children of [[Amenhotep III]] and Queen Tiye.&lt;ref name="pmid20159872"/&gt; There is speculation over the identity of the mummy from KV55 (sister marriage existed), with some [[Egyptologists]], including [[Zahi Hawass]], claiming the mummy is [[Akhenaten]], and others, including [[anthropologist]] Joyce Filer, claiming the mummy as [[Smenkhare]]. This family relationship would lessen the possibility that the Younger Lady (and, by extension, Tutankhamun's mother) was either [[Nefertiti]], or Akhenaten's secondary wife [[Kiya]], because no known artifact accords either wife titles such as "King's sister" or "King's Daughter".&lt;ref name="jama eAppendix"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawass | first1 = Z | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = Ancestry and pathology in King Tutankhamun's family | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 303 | issue = 7| page = 3 |pmid=20159872 |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of the younger lady being [[Sitamun]], [[Iset (daughter of Amenhotep III)|Isis]], or [[Henuttaneb]] is considered unlikely, as they were Great Royal Wives of their father Amenhotep III, and had Akhenaten married any of them, they would have taken the place of Nefertiti as the principal queen of Egypt. The report concludes that the mummy is likely to be [[Nebetah]] or [[Beketaten]], daughters of Amenhotep III not known to have married their father, although he is known to have had eight daughters with Queen Tiye.&lt;ref name="jama eAppendix"/&gt;

There is also a theory that the younger lady is [[Meritaten]], daughter of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, and wife of [[Smenkhare]], based on a study of the alleles inherited by Tutankhamun. The theory goes that Meritaten married Smenkhare, believed to be her uncle, thereby making Tutankhamun a maternal grandson of Akhenaten. The theory holds weight as inbreeding makes it harder to distinguish the generations, but there is one problem with this theory. Meritaten must be a mitochondrial descendant of Queen [[Tiye]], or her mother [[Thuya]], as the younger lady's [[mitochondrial DNA]] fits with her being Tiye's daughter. Nefertiti's lineage is nowhere specified, and if Meritaten is the younger lady, Nefertiti must be a mitochondrial relation of Thuya{{Citation needed|reason=The above-cited JAMA paper doesn't include an analysis of mtDNA, the below-cited Nature paper only mentions the intent to conduct such an analysis. Where are the results from?|date=June 2017}}.

It has been suggested {{Citation needed|reason=The above-cited JAMA paper doesn't include an analysis of mtDNA, the below-cited Nature paper only mentions the intent to conduct such an analysis. Where are the results from?|date=June 2017}} that, indeed, the Younger Lady is Nefertiti, as incest was not uncommon. This would mean that Akhenaten did marry his own sister and that he and Nefertiti are the parents of Tutankhamun. Furthermore, Nefertiti, who may have survived her husband, may be identical with Smenkhare and may have adopted this name if she took over the reign after Akhenaten's death (and having her daughter move into her official roles of chief priestess and 'wife'). All this is not proven, but should be mentioned as a further plausible scenario.&lt;ref name="Habicht"&gt;Michael E. Habicht, Nofretete und Echnaton, 2012, Koehler &amp; Amelang, {{ISBN|978-3733803810}}&lt;/ref&gt; One difficulty posed by this identification is the mummy's age at death, because Nefertiti gave birth to Meritaten no later than year 1 of Akhenaten's reign and there is evidence that she was still alive during year 16.

==Description of the mummy==
[[File:TheYoungerLady-61072-GESmith'sFullBodySketch-Diagram10-TheRoyalMummies-1912.gif|thumb|100px|right|A sketch made by Grafton Elliot Smith of the full body of the Younger Lady mummy, documenting the extensive damage that existed when he discovered it]]
Grafton Elliot Smith provided an extensive description of the mummy in his survey of the ancient royal mummies at the beginning of the twentieth century. He found the mummy to be {{Height|m=1.58}} in height, and judged her to have been no older than 25 years old at the time of death.&lt;ref name="Smith 40"&gt;Smith, G. Elliot. &lt;cite&gt;The Royal Mummies&lt;/cite&gt;. p.40. Duckworth Egyptology. 2000 (Reprint from original 1912 edition). {{ISBN|0-7156-2959-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted the major damage done by ancient tomb robbers, who smashed the [[anterior]] wall of the mummy's chest, and had torn the right arm off just below the shoulder.&lt;ref name="Smith 41"&gt;Smith, G. Elliot. &lt;cite&gt;The Royal Mummies&lt;/cite&gt;. p.41. Duckworth Egyptology. 2000 (Reprint from original 1912 edition). {{ISBN|0-7156-2959-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith presumed that she was a member of the royal family.&lt;ref name="Smith 41"/&gt;

The Younger Lady has a gaping wound in the left side of her mouth and cheek. It had been thought that this wound, which also destroyed part of the jaw, had been the result of actions of the tomb robbers,&lt;ref name="Smith 41"/&gt; but a more recent re-examination of the mummy while it was undergoing genetic tests and CT scans determined that the wound had happened prior to death and that the injury had been lethal.&lt;ref name="jama eAppendix"/&gt; Julian Heath suggests that the wound was likely the result of an [[axe]] blow. &lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;Heath (2015), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Below her left breast there is another wound, likely to be the result of a [[stab wound]].&lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;Heath (2015), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, a scientific team from [[University of York]], working under [[Joann Fletcher]], examined the mummy. A member of the team realized that the face wound could have been a premortem wound, and not a postmortem wound as previously assumed. Instead of the Younger Lady's remains simply being mutilated after her death by tomb robbers motivated by malice, it seemed likely the Lady had been injured while still alive. The conclusion was considered uncertain.&lt;ref name="Hawass"&gt;Hawass, Saleem (2016), p. 131-132&lt;/ref&gt; At a later point, Ashraf Selim lent support to this theory. He noted that if the Younger Lady had been damaged following the embalming process, then bits of dried bone and flesh could be located in the mummy's wounds. Since no such findings occurred, he was certain that this was a pre-mortem wound. Further, Selim viewed the wound as too violent to be the result of an accident. The Lady had been injured in an act of deliberate violence.&lt;ref name="Hawass"/&gt; The Egyptian Mummy Project which used a [[CT scan]] to examine the mummy, located "very few pieces of the relevant broken bones" in the [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinus]] cavity. They concluded that the Younger Lady's face had been damaged before the embalming process, and likely prior to her death. Indeed, the face wound was determined to be a probable [[cause of death]] for the Lady.&lt;ref name="Hawass"/&gt;

The missing right arm of the mummy was the cause of a minor controversy between researchers. Two severed arms had been located within KV35, and either one was thought likely to belong to the Younger Lady. One was a bent arm with a clenched fist, while the other was a straight arm. It was typical for female Egyptian mummies to be positioned with one of their arms bent and the other one in a straight position. The hand more likely to be positioned as bent was the left hand.&lt;ref name="Hawass"/&gt; The Egyptian Mummy Project of Ashraf Selim examined both arms to resolve the controversy. The bent arm was compared to the Younger Lady's attached left hand, and was found to be too long to belong to the same woman. The bones of the two compared arms were also found "different in consistency". The straight arm was then compared to the Younger Lady's left arm. It was found to be of similar length and similar bone density, so the Project concluded that the straight arm most likely did belong to the Younger Lady.&lt;ref name="Hawass"/&gt; The identified right arm of the Younger Lady has two breaks, "one in the upper arm and one at the wrist". The hand has been severed from the rest of the limb.&lt;ref name="Hawass"/&gt;

A finding of lesser importance is that the Younger Lady has a [[Earring|double-pierced ear]]. Pierced ears were rather common for women of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], including royals and nonroyal women. The Lady's pierced ear can not help researchers determine her identity or social position.&lt;ref name="Hawass"/&gt; Similarly inconclusive for identification purposes was the discovery of a [[wig]] in KV35, which could have belonged to the Younger Lady. Supporters of the theory identifying the Lady with Nefertiti, pointed to the wig's perceived similarities with the type of wigs used by Nefertiti. They are fashion items used by Egyptian women of the same era, they can not help us identify the wig's user with the Queen.&lt;ref name="Hawass"/&gt;

==CT scan findings==
Following the [[CT scan]] of the Younger Lady, more detailed descriptions of the mummy have been published.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"&gt;Hawass, Saleem (2016), p. 80-83&lt;/ref&gt; A large defect in the anterior wall of the Lady's [[Thorax|chest]], and the [[disarticulation]] of the right upper limb (arm) are the main indications that the body suffered [[mutilation]] by ancient tomb robbers. Otherwise the mummy has been fairly preserved.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt; Despite previous disputes about the Lady's gender, the morphology of the [[skull]] and [[pelvis]] confirms that she was a human female (woman). The condition of the epiphyseal union and the closure of the [[Fibrous joint#Sutures|cranial sutures]] suggest that the Lady was between 25 and 35-years-old at the time of her death.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt; The Lady's height was 1,58 meters from the [[Vertex (anatomy)|vertex]] to the [[heel]]. Her left [[humerus]] was 29.3 centimeters in length. Her left [[femur]] was 40.5 centimeters in length. Her left [[tibia]] was 35.2 centimeters in length.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt;

The [[base of skull]] was found intact. The back of the skull cavity contains the shrunken and desiccated [[brain]] and [[dura mater]] of the Lady. There is no evidence of embalming material within the [[cranial cavity]]. Researchers located an oval defect in the skull. It is located in the central part of the [[frontal bone]], in front of the [[coronal suture]]. The defect has sharp, beveled, and festooned edges. The lack of evidence for attempted healing or [[Sclerosis (medicine)|sclerosis]] indicate that the defect was caused by a postmortem alteration of the body, probably during the embalming process. The embalmers likely used a sharp instrument on the skull.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt;

The left side of the lower face includes a large defect. The defect involves the Lady's left [[cheek]], her left [[maxillary sinus]], her [[alveolar process]], and part of her left [[mandible]]. There are sharp edges in this bony defect, with no evidence of attempted healing or sclerosis. Fragments of the broken lateral wall of the left maxillary sinus were located within the antral cavity. Fragments for most of the Lady's fractured bones are missing, and were apparently not placed in her tomb.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt;

The soft tissues located next to the facial defect were relatively thicker than the corresponding tissues on the intact and uninjured right side of her face. On top of the facial gap and partly beneath the remaining skin, there was located a rolled embalming pack. The composition of the pack is undetermined, though researchers consider it probable that is composed of [[linen]] which has been impregnated with [[resin]]. A similar substance was located on the right side of the face, particularly the cheek and the mid-face. More clearly identified packs of linen were located in the periphery of the Lady's [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbits]], placed in front of the [[Globe (human eye)|globes]] of the eyes. Resin was also located in the Lady's right [[nasal cavity]].&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt; The Lady's [[mouth]] is filled with linen. No embalming materials were placed within the Lady's [[throat]].&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt;

The [[Auricle (anatomy)|auricles]] of her [[ear]]s were found in much different condition. Part of the right auricle is missing, and can not be used to determine her appearance in life. Her left auricle is in a better condition, and two piercings were located in its [[earlobe]]. The Lady had a double-pierced ear.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt;

The Lady has several missing [[Human tooth|teeth]] due to her facial injury. Her left alveolar plate and part of her left [[jaw]] were fractured, explaining what happened to her teeth. One tooth is visible within her mouth. The fracture involved most of her left alveolar plate [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] to the left first [[incisor]]. This incisor is among the missing teeth.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt; The right alveolar plate is in a better condition, though the [[Dental alveolus|sockets]] of the first incisor and the right [[canine tooth]] are empty, with these teeth missing. The rest of the teeth are still present, including an [[Tooth eruption|nonerupted]] [[Wisdom tooth|third molar]] (wisdom tooth).&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt;

The fracture of mandible involved the midline and the adjacent part of the left mandible. Her right and left first incisors and the left canine tooth were affected by this fracture. The sockets of the right second incisor, the left first [[Molar (tooth)|molar]], and the left second molar are empty, with these teeth missing. The first and second left upper molars are partially fractured. Both the right and the left upper third molars are nonerupted. Conversely, the Lady's upper right canine, [[premolar]]s, first molar, and second molar are still present. This group of teeth has no visible [[Attrition (dental)|attrition]], and no [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occlusal]] irregularity of their surface.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt;

Research on the Lady's [[Vertebral column|spine]] located a smooth lateral curve on the [[lumbar]] region (lower spine), with a convexity towards the left. This is an indication of lumbar [[scoliosis]].&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt; The limits of the curve have been determined. The upper limit is between the twelfth [[Thoracic vertebrae|thoracic vertebra]] and the first [[Lumbar vertebrae|lumbar vertebra]]. The lower limit is between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. The center of the curve is between the second and third lumbar vertebrae.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt; The scoliosis of the Lady is mild, with a [[Cobb angle]] of less than 20°.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt; Researchers found no evidence of structural abnormalities in the vertebrae, no fractures, and no [[Congenital disorder|congenital anomalies]] (birth defects). The researchers suspect that the Lady may not have actually suffered from scoliosis while still alive. The curved spine of the mummy may be a postmortem condition, resulting from the position of the body during the mummification process.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt;

There is a large defect in the anterior wall of the Lady's [[torso]]. The [[Organ (anatomy)|viscera]] (internal organs) were removed by the mummy's embalmers, with the exception of the Lady's [[heart]] which is still visible within the body. The heart was apparently never moved. The embalming incision has been located in the left inguinal region. This tissue gap is 56 millimetres in length and 135 millimetres in depth.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt; The torso contains both linen fibers which were mildly smeared with resin, and with linen packs treated with resin. One of the resin-treated linen packs was placed within the pelvis. The [[pelvic floor]] has a large defect, possibly used during the mummification process to remove the viscera. This would be an example of perineal [[Disembowelment|evisceration]].&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt;

The left [[upper limb]] (arm) of the Lady extends beside her body, with the hand placed over the left [[hip]]. There is a complete transverse fracture of the proximal portion of the shaft, in the right [[humerus]]. The fracture has gaping ends. There is no evidence of attempted healing or for the formation of a [[callus]] in this area.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt; The disarticulated right upper limb (arm) has been placed beside the body. The right hand has been broken and completely separated from the [[wrist]]. This hand has been placed at the feet of the mummy.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt;

The lower limbs ([[human leg]]s) have also been damaged. The left [[iliac crest]] contains small fractures. The [[inferior pubic ramus]] also contains similar fractures. Due to the lack of evidence of healing, it is likely that all these fractures were part of the postmortem damage to the Lady's body.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt; The right [[tibia]] has a defective area at the front of the distal shaft. The defective area extends 33.5 millimetres above the [[ankle]] joint. The [[metatarsal bones]] of both feet are broken, and missing from the body. The [[phalanx bone]]s of both feet are also missing.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt; There is a [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] (hypodermic) filling at the back of the Lady's right hip region, where her [[Buttocks|buttock]] is located.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt;

Researchers have noted some peculiarities in the mummification process used on the Lady. The evisceration of the body and the stuffing of the torso with embalming materials were standard parts of the mummification process used during the entire reign of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]]. This was not the case with the intact skull base and lack of effort to remove the brain, seen in the case of the Lady. This process had been used on early rulers of the 18th dynasty, as seen in the mummies currently identified with [[Thutmose I]], [[Thutmose II]], and [[Thutmose III]]. By the time of the later rulers of the 18th dynasty, when the Lady lived and died, the process had changed. All mummies from this later era contain some treatment of the brain, in attempts to remove it from the body. The mummification process used on the Lady seems like a throwback to an earlier era.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt; Another peculiarity is the evidence that the people behind the mummification process were trying to repair and cover injured areas of the body. They used subcutaneous fillings and packs to remodel the injured left side of the face, the contralateral side of the face, and the right hip region. This was not part of the regular efforts of an embalmer.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt;

The results of the CT scan support the idea that the Lady's facial injury took place prior to her mummification. The researchers consider this to have been a perimortem injury, happening either shortly before the Lady's death or following her death; in the short period between the death and the mummification. Either way the embalmers would have started work on an already damaged body. The lack of signs of healing would support the idea that the Lady received a mortal wound, and her body had no time to attempt recovery. The nature of the injury, however, could not be fully determined. The small fragments of bone found within the maxillary antral sinus, at least indicate the direction of the [[Major trauma|trauma]]. Something was "pushing" the bones within, rather than "pulling" them out.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt; A heavy object hitting the Lady's face would have such an effect. If not an intentional act, an accident involving the Lady receiving a strong [[kick]] from an animal would have the same result. A [[horse]] would have sufficient strength to kill with its kicks.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt; In any case, an acute facial trauma to a living woman would cause severe shock and [[bleeding]]. Then this shock and the bleeding would likely cause her death.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt;

While the CT scan researchers thought the Lady's death likely to be violent or accidental, they were less certain of what caused the skull defect and the defect in the anterior wall of the body. Whether they were perimortem or postmortem injuries to the body could not be determined. They could be the result of the same mysterious lethal incident as the facial injury, or caused long after the Lady's death by the ancient tomb robbers.&lt;ref name="Hawass1"/&gt;

Hermann Schögl, a Swiss Egyptologist, agrees with the medical and DNA findings of the teams working under [[Zahi Hawass]], but disputes several of the identifications of the royal and noble mummies. Schögl agrees that the head injuries which the Lady received were lethal, and has suggested that she was killed in a [[chariot]] accident.&lt;ref name="Eaton-Krauss"&gt;Eaton-Krauss (2016), p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; Schögl believes that the Younger Lady is Nefertiti, and that she was killed in a chariot accident during [[regnal year]] 14 of [[Akhenaten]]'s reign. However, the archaeological findings from Akhenaten's reign seem to indicate that Nefertiti was still alive during regnal year 16, two years following the date Schögl has chosen for her death.&lt;ref name="Eaton-Krauss"/&gt; Marianne Eaton-Krauss, another Egyptologist, finds Schögl's alternative royal genealogy for the 18th dynasty and his attempted reconstruction of the final years of Akhenaten's reign to be rather unconvincing.&lt;ref name="Eaton-Krauss"/&gt;

Natalia Klimczack, a historian and journalist, reports that several Egyptologists consider it likely that the Younger Lady may be [[Kiya]]. Kiya was one of Akhenaten's queens, but disappears from the historical record by regnal year 12 or 13 of Akhenaten's reign. Her time of death is not indicated in the primary sources. As [[Aidan Dodson]], an Egyptologist, has pointed out, several of the monuments and objects originally dedicated to Kiya were later usurped by other royals.&lt;ref name="Klimczack"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Klimczack |first1 = Natalia |date = January 3, 2016 |title = Kiya - The Most Mysterious Woman of Amarna |url = http://www.ancient-origins.net/history/kiya-most-mysterious-woman-amarna-005092 |work = Ancient Origins: Reconstructing the story of humanity's past |access-date = October 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Pharaoh whose identity is unclear was buried in Kiya's coffin instead of her. Relief representations of Kiya were altered to instead depict [[Meritaten]] and/or [[Ankhesenamun]]. To Aiden this suggests that Kiya had fallen from grace, and that there was an effort to erase her from the historical record.&lt;ref name="Klimczack"/&gt; The premortem facial injury of the Younger Lady would fit this theory. The Lady did not die of natural causes, the facial injury indicates that she was murdered. If she was Kiya, this would explain her sudden disappearance from the historical record and efforts to remove her depictions in it.&lt;ref name="Klimczack"/&gt;

==Historical record==
Marianne Eaton-Krauss has called attention to the apparent absence of the Younger Lady, as Tutankhamun/Tutankhaten's mother, from the available [[Recorded history|historical record]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. As of the 2010s, nobody has been able to find an [[Epigraphy|inscription]], a [[relief]], or a [[statue]] dedicated to this young Pharaoh's mother. [[KV62]], the tomb of Tutankhamun, contains [[Souvenir|memorabilia]] from his life and reign. None of these items ever mentions his mother.&lt;ref name="Eaton-Krauss"/&gt;

There is a contrast between the Younger Lady and a number of influential [[queen mother]]s from the later reigns of the 18th dynasty, who had a large presence in the reigns of their sons. [[Tiaa]] served as queen mother to [[Thutmose IV]], [[Mutemwiya]] as queen mother to [[Amenhotep III]], and [[Tiye]] as queen mother to [[Akhenaten]]. It seems likely that Tutankhamun/Tutankhaten never had a queen mother, indicating that the Younger Lady (or any other mother) had died before his rise to the throne.&lt;ref name="Eaton-Krauss"/&gt;

Despite the Younger Lady being daughter to a Pharaoh (Amenhotep III), full sister and probable wife to a second Pharaoh (Akhenaten), and mother to a third Pharaoh (Tutankhamun/Tutankhaten), she herself does not appear to have been a prominent figure in her lifetime. [[Willeke Wendrich]], an Egyptologist, considers it likely that the Lady was a minor wife or a [[concubinage|concubine]] to Akhenaten, rather than his Queen.&lt;ref name="Than"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Than |first1 = Ken |date = February 17, 2010 |title = King Tut Mysteries Solved: Was Disabled, Malarial, and Inbred |url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/02/100216-king-tut-malaria-bones-inbred-tutankhamun/ |work = [[National Geographic Society#Other publications|National Geographic News]] |access-date = October 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendrich notes that the Pharaohs of Egypt typically had multiple wives. This often resulted in multiple sons serving as viable heirs to the throne, and potential competition between the sons to gain the right to succeed their father.&lt;ref name="Than"/&gt;

==Face reconstruction==
On 7 February 2018, The Younger Lady was featured on the 7th episode of the 4th season of [[Expedition Unknown]] titled Great Women of Ancient Egypt. On the assumption that she is indeed to be identified as Neferititi and using preserved remains, modern technology and artistry, a team led by Expedition Unknown's host [[Josh Gates]] presented a reconstruction of what The Younger Lady would have looked like in her full royal regalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thegrio.com/2018/02/06/nefertiti-today-show/|title=Black Twitter roasts TODAY show for Queen Nefertiti reconstruction that looks like a white woman - theGrio|date=2018-02-06|work=theGrio|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bust was created by French paleoartist [[Elisabeth_Daynes|Élisabeth Daynès]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/ancient-egypt-queen-nefertiti-ancient-bust-fair-skin-800519|title=A new, anatomically accurate bust depicts Queen Nefertiti—but with fair skin|date=2018-02-07|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Thomas William Shakespeare, 3rd Baronet''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 11 May 1966), better known as '''Tom Shakespeare''', is an English [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[Television presenter|broadcaster]]. He has [[achondroplasia]] and uses a [[wheelchair]].

==Early life==
[[File:Chapel, Radley College, 22-05-2007.jpg|thumb|right|Radley College]]
A member of the [[Shakespeare baronets|Shakespeare family]], his grandfather, Sir [[Geoffrey Shakespeare]], was made a baronet following long service as a [[Member of Parliament]] and in various senior government roles. While still a student, Tom was featured in a television documentary by [[Lord Snowdon]] connected to his 1976 report 'Integrating the Disabled' about his restricted growth, along with his father, Sir William Geoffrey Shakespeare, a prominent medical practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;Defying Disability: The Lives and Legacies of Nine Disabled Leaders, Mary Wilkinson, Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 2009, pg 83&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a nurse of [[Burgher people|Sri Lankan Burgher]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://farmerofthoughts.co.uk/biography/|title=Biography » Tom Shakespeare|work=Tom Shakespeare|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare was educated at [[Radley College]], [[Oxfordshire]], taking [[A-levels]] in English, History, and History of Art; and [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], where he matriculated in 1984 to read [[Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, University of Cambridge|Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic]].&lt;ref&gt;'Tom Shakespeare: Academic', in Mary Wilkinson, ''Defying Disability: The Lives and Legacies of Nine Disabled Leaders'' (London: Kingsley, 2009), pp. 79-98 (at p. 83).&lt;/ref&gt; He gained a [[Master of Philosophy|MPhil]] degree from [[King's College, Cambridge]], in 1991.

==Career==
[[File:Tom_Shakespeare_appearing_on_TV_discussion_programme_"After_Dark"_on_30_May_1994.jpg|thumb|left|Appearing on ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' in 1994]]
Shakespeare then lectured in sociology at the [[University of Sunderland]] from 1993 and returned to King's College in 1995 to obtain his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree. His father died in 1996 and Shakespeare inherited [[Shakespeare baronets|his baronetcy]], but does not use the title. He is also a campaigner for [[disability rights]], a writer on [[disability]], genetics and [[bio-ethics]] and was the co-author of ''The Sexual Politics of Disability'' (1996; {{ISBN|0-304-33329-8}}).

He studied political science at Cambridge University. As a radical student, he supported liberation movements such as feminism, anti-racism and lesbian and gay rights. During his MPhil, he wrote a book about the politics of disability. He also wrote the book ''Disability Rights and Wrongs'' published by Routledge in 2006 and edited ''Arguing About Disability'' published in 2009 by Routledge.

He has worked as a research fellow at both [[Newcastle University]] and [[Leeds University]], and has worked for the [[World Health Organization]] in Geneva.  He served as a member of the [[Arts Council of England]] between 2003 and 2008.  He has presented programmes on [[BBC Radio 4]], including ''[[A Point of View]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliament Roadshow|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07qc93n|website=A Point of View|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare is currently Professor of Disability Research in the medical faculty at the [[University of East Anglia]] (UEA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uea.ac.uk/medicine/people/profile/tom-shakespeare |title=UEA website |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the [[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuffieldbioethics.org/about/council-members |title=Nuffield Council on Bioethics, Council Members |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At UEA, he has conducted research, including one regarding group singing and its beneficial effects against depression and anxiety; the findings were published in the academic journal ''Medical Humanities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mh.bmj.com/content/early/2017/11/25/medhum-2017-011195 |title=Sing Your Heart Out: community singing as part of mental health recovery |accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018 Shakespeare was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britac.ac.uk/news/record-number-academics-elected-british-academy|title=Record number of academics elected to British Academy {{!}} British Academy|website=British Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2002 Shakespeare married dancer and disability rights campaigner Caroline Bowditch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/caroline-fathoms-magic-of-dance-4469216 |title=Caroline fathoms magic of dance |publisher=The Journal |date= |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a son and a daughter. He is a member of the [[Religious Society of Friends|Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sofn.org.uk/conf2009/docs/flier2009.pdf Science and Religion: Making Meaning]'', Conference of Sea of Faith Network (UK), July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010 he had split with his wife and he lived in [[Geneva]] with his partner, Alana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sue Fox |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Magazine/Regulars/article414114.ece |title=Impatient, bloody minded, stubborn... that’s me and my dad &amp;#124; The Times &amp; The Sunday Times |website=Thesundaytimes.co.uk |date=2010-10-17 |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 he featured on the ITV show ''[[500 Questions#United Kingdom|500 Questions]]'', winning £14,000 by answering 42 out of 50 questions.

[[File:Diving stage.jpg|thumb|Surface-supplied divers riding a stage to the underwater workplace|alt= Two divers wearing lightweight demand helmets stand back-to-back on an underwater platform holding on to the railings. The photo also shows the support vessel above the surface in the background.]]

&lt;!--definition--&gt;'''Underwater diving''', as a human activity, is the practice of descending below the water's surface to interact with the environment.
&lt;!--physiology--&gt;Immersion in water and exposure to high ambient pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in [[ambient pressure]] diving. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has been developed to extend the depth and duration of human dives, and allow different types of work to be done.

&lt;!--modes--&gt;In ambient pressure diving, the diver is directly exposed to the pressure of the surrounding water. The ambient pressure diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for [[scuba diving]] or [[surface-supplied diving]], and the [[saturation diving]] technique reduces the risk of [[decompression sickness]] (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. [[Atmospheric diving suits]] (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed [[submersible]]s can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.

&lt;!--safety--&gt;The environment exposes the diver to a wide range of hazards, and though the risks are largely controlled by appropriate [[scuba skills|diving skills]], [[diver training|training]], types of [[diving equipment|equipment]] and [[breathing gas]]es used depending on the mode, depth and purpose of diving, it remains a relatively dangerous activity. 
&lt;!--range--&gt;Diving activities are restricted to maximum depths of about {{convert|40|m|ft}} for recreational scuba diving, {{convert|530|m|ft}} for commercial saturation diving, and {{convert|610|m|ft}} wearing atmospheric suits. Diving is also restricted to conditions which are not excessively hazardous, though the level of risk acceptable can vary.

&lt;!--activities--&gt;[[Recreational diving]] (sometimes called sport diving or subaquatics) is a popular leisure activity. [[Technical diving]] is a form of recreational diving under especially challenging conditions. [[Professional diving]] (commercial diving, diving for research purposes, or for financial gain) involves working underwater. [[Public safety diving]] is the underwater work done by law enforcement, fire rescue, and [[underwater search and recovery]] dive teams. [[Military diving]] includes combat diving, clearance diving and [[ships husbandry]].
&lt;!--terminology--&gt;''Deep sea diving'' is underwater diving, usually with surface-supplied equipment, and often refers to the use of [[standard diving dress]] with the traditional copper helmet. ''Hard hat'' diving is any form of diving with a [[Diving helmet|helmet]], including the standard copper helmet, and other forms of [[Diving helmet#Free-flow helmets|free-flow]] and [[Diving helmet#Lightweight demand helmets|lightweight demand helmets]].
&lt;!--history--&gt;The history of breath-hold diving goes back at least to classical times, and there is evidence of prehistoric [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] of seafoods that may have involved underwater swimming. Technical advances allowing the provision of breathing gas to a diver underwater at ambient pressure are recent, and self-contained breathing systems developed at an accelerated rate following the [[Second World War]].

==Physiological constraints on diving==
{{main|Physiology of underwater diving}}

Immersion in water and exposure to cold water and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Breath-hold endurance is a severe limitation, and breathing at high ambient pressure adds further complications, both directly and indirectly. Technological solutions have been developed which can greatly extend depth and duration of human ambient pressure dives, and allow useful work to be done underwater.&lt;ref name="ECHM-EDTM 2011" /&gt;

===Immersion===
{{main|Physiological response to water immersion}}
Immersion of the human body in water affects the [[Circulatory system|circulation]], [[renal system]], [[fluid balance]], and breathing, because the external [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a [[blood shift]] from the [[extravascular]] tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity,&lt;ref name="Pendergast and Lundgren 2009" /&gt; and fluid losses known as [[immersion diuresis]] compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion.&lt;ref name="Kollias et al 1976" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pendergast and Lundgren 2009" /&gt; Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.&lt;ref name="Kollias et al 1976" /&gt;

The blood shift causes an increased respiratory and cardiac workload. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but [[bradycardia|slowed heartbeat]] reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly because of the [[diving reflex]] in [[breath-hold diving]].&lt;ref name="Pendergast and Lundgren 2009" /&gt; Lung volume decreases in the upright position, owing to cranial displacement of the abdomen from hydrostatic pressure, and resistance to air flow in the airways increases because of the decrease in lung volume.&lt;ref name="Kollias et al 1976" /&gt; There appears to be a connection between [[pulmonary edema]] and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure, which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submerged.&lt;ref name="Pendergast and Lundgren 2009" /&gt;

===Exposure===
[[Cold shock response]] is the [[physiological]] response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, and is a common cause of death from immersion in very cold water,&lt;ref name="coldii" /&gt; such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction;&lt;ref name=phases /&gt; the heart has to work harder to pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.&lt;ref name="coldii" /&gt;

The [[diving reflex]] is a response to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic [[reflex]]es.&lt;ref name="Physiology and Pathophysiology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Panneton 2013" /&gt; It optimises [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, which allows extended periods underwater. It is exhibited strongly in [[aquatic mammal]]s ([[pinniped|seals]],&lt;ref name="Zapol et al 1989" /&gt; [[otter]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[muskrat]]s),&lt;ref name="McCulloch 2012" /&gt; and also exists in other mammals, including [[human]]s. [[Diving bird]]s, such as [[penguin]]s, have a similar diving reflex.&lt;ref name="Physiology and Pathophysiology" /&gt; The diving reflex is triggered by chilling the face and holding the breath.&lt;ref name="Physiology and Pathophysiology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Speck and Bruce 1978" /&gt; The cardiovascular system constricts peripheral blood vessels, slows the pulse rate, redirects blood to the vital organs to conserve oxygen, releases red blood cells stored in the [[spleen]], and, in humans, causes heart rhythm irregularities.&lt;ref name="Physiology and Pathophysiology" /&gt; Aquatic mammals have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, but apnea, slowed pulse rate, and vasoconstriction are shared with terrestrial mammals.&lt;ref name="Panneton 2013" /&gt;

[[Hypothermia]] is reduced body temperature that happens when a body loses more heat than it generates.&lt;ref name=NEJM2012 /&gt; Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water.&lt;ref name=sterba /&gt; The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn increases the risk of other injuries.&lt;ref name=sterba /&gt;&lt;ref name=cheung /&gt; Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be tolerable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers.&lt;ref name=sterba /&gt;

===Breath-hold limitations===
Breath-hold diving by an air-breathing animal is limited to the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface. As this internal oxygen supply reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge to breathe caused by [[hypercapnia|buildup of carbon dioxide]] and [[Lactic acid|lactate]] in the blood,&lt;ref name="Berta et al 2015" /&gt; followed by loss of consciousness due to [[hypoxia (medical)|central nervous system hypoxia]]. If this occurs underwater, it will drown.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996" /&gt;

[[Freediving blackout|Blackouts in freediving]] can occur when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue towards the end of the dive ([[Bohr effect]]); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.&lt;ref name="Pollock 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson 2015" /&gt;

Ascent-induced hypoxia is caused by a drop in oxygen partial pressure as ambient pressure is reduced. The partial pressure of oxygen at depth may be sufficient to maintain consciousness but only at that depth and not at the reduced pressures nearer the surface.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNS clinic" /&gt;

===Ambient pressure changes===
[[File:Mask Squeeze.jpg|thumb|alt= Eye and surrounding skin of young male showing petechial and subconjunctival haemmorhages |Mild barotrauma to a diver caused by mask squeeze]]
[[Barotrauma]], an example of [[dysbarism]], is physical damage to body tissues caused by a difference in [[pressure]] between a gas space inside, or in contact with the body, and the surrounding gas or fluid.&lt;ref name="Brubakk" /&gt; It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.{{sfnp|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2006}}

The initial damage is usually due to over-stretching the tissues in tension or shear, either directly by expansion of the gas in the closed space, or by pressure difference hydrostatically transmitted through the tissue.&lt;ref name=Brubakk /&gt;

Barotrauma generally manifests as sinus or middle ear effects, DCS, lung overpressure injuries, and injuries resulting from external squeezes.&lt;ref name=Brubakk /&gt; Barotraumas of descent are caused by preventing the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space in contact with the diver, resulting in a pressure difference between the tissues and the gas space, and the unbalanced force due to this pressure difference causes deformation of the tissues resulting in cell rupture.&lt;ref name=Brubakk /&gt; Barotraumas of ascent are also caused when the free change of volume of the gas in a closed space in contact with the diver is prevented. In this case the pressure difference causes a resultant tension in the surrounding tissues which exceeds their tensile strength. Besides tissue rupture, the overpressure may cause ingress of gases into the tissues and further afield through the circulatory system.  This can cause blockage of circulation at distant sites, or interfere with the normal function of an organ by its presence.&lt;ref name=Brubakk /&gt;

===Breathing under pressure===
{{see also|Physiology of decompression}}
Provision of breathing gas at ambient pressure can greatly prolong the duration of a dive, but there are other problems that may result from this technological solution. Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased as a function of time and pressure, and these may both produce undesirable effects immediately, as a consequence of their presence in the tissues in the dissolved state, such as [[nitrogen narcosis]] and [[high pressure nervous syndrome]],{{sfnp|Brubakk|2003|p=305}}{{sfnp|Brubakk|2003|loc="The High Pressure Nervous Syndrome", pp323-57}} or cause problems when coming out of solution within the tissues during [[Decompression (diving)|decompression]].{{sfnp|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2006|loc=vol. 1, ch. 3, sec. 9.3}}

Other problems arise when the concentration of metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the [[Oxygen toxicity|toxic effects of oxygen]] at high partial pressure,{{sfnp|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2006|p=44|loc=vol. 1, ch. 3}} through [[Hypercarbia|buildup of carbon dioxide]] due to excessive work of breathing, increased [[Dead space (physiology)|dead space]],&lt;ref name="Lanphier 1956b" /&gt; or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures.{{sfnp|''NOAA Diving Manual''|2001|loc=Chapter 5 Table 5.2 Air Purity Standards}} Hydrostatic pressure differences between the interior of the lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased [[work of breathing]] and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.&lt;ref name="Pendergast and Lundgren 2009" /&gt;

===Sensory impairment===
[[File:FlatMask above-below.jpg|thumb|alt=View of a rectangular grating through a flat-glazed diving half-mask, showing magnification and a detail of slight pincushion distortion and chromatic aberration in the through-water view.|Views through a flat mask, above and below water]]
&lt;!--visual--&gt;
[[Underwater vision]] is affected by the clarity and the [[refractive index]] of the medium. Visibility underwater is reduced because light passing through water attenuates rapidly with distance, leading to lower levels of natural illumination. Underwater objects are also blurred by scattering of light between the object and the viewer, resulting in lower contrast. These effects vary with the wavelength of the light, and the colour and [[turbidity]] of the water. The human eye is optimised for air vision, and when it is immersed in direct contact with water, [[visual acuity]] is adversely affected by the difference in refractive index between water and air. Provision of an airspace between the cornea and the water can compensate, but causes scale and distance distortion. Artificial illumination can improve visibility at short range.&lt;ref name="Luria and Kinney 1970" /&gt; Stereoscopic acuity, the ability to judge relative distances of different objects, is considerably reduced underwater, and this is affected by the field of vision. A narrow field of vision caused by a small viewport in a helmet results in greatly reduced stereoacuity,&lt;ref name="Luria and Kinney 1970" /&gt; and an apparent movement of a stationary object when the head is moved.&lt;ref name="Ferris 1972" /&gt; These effects lead to poorer hand-eye coordination.&lt;ref name="Luria and Kinney 1970" /&gt;

&lt;!--Hearing--&gt;
Water has different [[Underwater acoustics|acoustic properties]] from those of air. Sound from an underwater source can propagate relatively freely through body tissues where there is contact with the water as the acoustic properties are similar. When the head is exposed to the water, some sound is transmitted by the eardrum and middle ear, but a significant part reaches the cochlea independently, by bone conduction.&lt;ref name="Anthony et al 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shupak et al 2005" /&gt; Some sound localisation is possible, though difficult.&lt;ref name="Anthony et al 2009" /&gt; Human hearing underwater, in cases where the diver's ear is wet, is less sensitive than in air.&lt;ref name="Anthony et al 2009" /&gt; Frequency sensitivity underwater also differs from that in air, with a consistently higher threshold of hearing underwater; sensitivity to higher frequency sounds is reduced the most.&lt;ref name="Anthony et al 2009" /&gt; The type of headgear affects noise sensitivity and noise hazard depending on whether transmission is wet or dry.&lt;ref name="Anthony et al 2009" /&gt; Human hearing underwater is less sensitive with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood causes substantial attenuation. When wearing a helmet, hearing sensitivity is similar to that in surface air, as it is not greatly affected by the breathing gas or chamber atmosphere composition or pressure.&lt;ref name="Anthony et al 2009" /&gt; Because sound travels faster in heliox than in air, voice [[formant]]s are raised, making divers' speech high-pitched and distorted, and hard to understand for people not used to it.&lt;ref name="Ackerman and Maitland 1975" /&gt; The increased density of breathing gases under pressure has a similar and additive effect.&lt;ref name="Rothman et al 1980" /&gt;

&lt;!--Tactile--&gt;
Tactile sensory perception in divers may be impaired by the environmental protection suit and low temperatures. The combination of instability, equipment, neutral buoyancy and resistance to movement by the inertial and viscous effects of the water encumbers the diver. Cold causes losses in sensory and motor function and distracts from and disrupts cognitive activity. The ability to exert large and precise force is reduced.&lt;ref name="Shilling et al 2013" /&gt;

&lt;!--Balance--&gt;
[[Sense of balance|Balance]] and equilibrium depend on vestibular function and secondary input from visual, organic, cutaneous, kinesthetic and sometimes auditory senses which are processed by the central nervous system to provide the sense of balance. Underwater, some of these inputs may be absent or diminished, making the remaining cues more important. Conflicting input may result in vertigo, disorientation and [[motion sickness]]. The vestibular sense is essential in these conditions for rapid, intricate and accurate movement.&lt;ref name="Shilling et al 2013" /&gt;&lt;!--Proprioception etc--&gt;[[Proprioception|Proprioceptive]] perception makes the diver aware of personal position and movement, in association with the vestibular and visual input, and allows the diver to function effectively in maintaining physical equilibrium and balance in the water.&lt;ref name="Shilling et al 2013" /&gt; In the water at neutral buoyancy, the proprioceptive cues of position are reduced or absent. This effect may be exacerbated by the diver's suit and other equipment.&lt;ref name="Shilling et al 2013" /&gt;

&lt;!--Smell and taste--&gt;
Taste and smell are not very important to the diver in the water but more important to the saturation diver while in accommodation chambers. There is evidence of a slight decrease in threshold for taste and smell after extended periods under pressure.&lt;ref name="Shilling et al 2013" /&gt;

==Diving modes==
There are several modes of diving based on the [[diving equipment]] used.

===Freediving===
{{main|Freediving}}
[[File:Divers (2901939922).jpg|thumb|Recreational breath-hold divers in basic equipment with floats and catch bags suitable for collecting lobster or shellfish|alt= A croup of three divers dressed in wetsuits standing on a rocky shore with the sea in the background. On the ground are inflated truck inner tube floats with nets to support their catch]]
The ability to dive and swim underwater while holding one's breath is considered a useful emergency skill, an important part of water sport and Navy safety training, and an enjoyable leisure activity.&lt;ref name="BSAC Sport Diving" /&gt; Underwater diving without breathing apparatus can be categorised as underwater swimming, [[snorkeling|snorkelling]] and freediving. These categories overlap considerably. Several competitive [[underwater sports]] are practised without breathing apparatus.&lt;ref name="Aquathon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Apnoea" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hockey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rugby" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spearfishing" /&gt;

Freediving precludes the use of external breathing devices, and relies on the ability of divers to hold their breath until resurfacing. The technique ranges from simple breath-hold diving to competitive [[apnea]] dives. Fins and a diving mask are often used in free diving to improve vision and provide more efficient propulsion. A short breathing tube called a snorkel allows the diver to breathe at the surface while the face is immersed.  [[Snorkelling]] on the surface with no intention of diving is a popular water sport and recreational activity.&lt;ref name="BSAC Sport Diving" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NPAL /&gt;

Scuba diving is diving with a [[Scuba set|self-contained underwater breathing apparatus]], which is completely independent of surface supply.  Scuba gives the diver mobility and horizontal range far beyond the reach of an umbilical hose attached to surface-supplied diving equipment (SSDE).{{sfnp|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2006|loc=Chapter 1 Section 3 Scuba Diving}}
Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as [[frogmen]], combat divers or attack swimmers.&lt;ref name="Welham 1999" /&gt;

Open circuit scuba systems discharge the breathing gas into the environment as it is exhaled, and consist of one or more [[diving cylinder]]s containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a [[diving regulator]]. They may include additional cylinders for decompression gas or emergency breathing gas.{{sfnp|''NOAA Diving Manual''|2001|loc=Chapter 5 Section 4 Emergency Air Supply}}

Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit [[Rebreather diving|rebreather]] scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.{{sfnp|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2006|loc=Chapter 17 Section 1 Introduction}}

A scuba diver moves underwater by using [[Swimfin|fins]] attached to the feet;{{sfnp|''NOAA Diving Manual''|2001|loc=Chapter 1 Section 4 Scuba Diving}} external propulsion can be provided by a [[diver propulsion vehicle]], or a [[towboard]] pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a [[diving mask]] to improve [[underwater vision]], a protective [[diving suit]], [[Buoyancy compensator (diving)|equipment to control buoyancy]], and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive.{{sfnp|''NOAA Diving Manual''|2001|loc=Chapter 5 Diver and Diving Support Equipment}} Scuba divers are trained in the [[Scuba skills|procedures and skills]] appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the [[List of diver certification organizations|diver certification organisations]] which issue these [[diver certification]]s. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment and dealing with the general [[List of diving hazards and precautions|hazards of the underwater environment]], and emergency procedures for self-help and [[diver rescue|assistance]] of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of [[fitness to dive|fitness and health]] is required by most training organisations, and a higher level of fitness may be needed for some applications.{{sfnp|''NOAA Diving Manual''|2001|loc=Chapter 7 Diver and Support Personnel Training}}

An alternative to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases from the surface through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line it is called the [[Umbilical cable|diver's umbilical]], which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an [[Surface-supplied diving#Airline|airline]] or hookah system.&lt;ref name="CoP Inshore" /&gt;{{sfnp|''NOAA Diving Manual''|2001|loc=Chapter 5 Diver and Diving Support Equipment}}&lt;ref name="Eleftheriou 2013" /&gt; This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as [[snuba]], a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.&lt;ref name="Eleftheriou 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffington 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="snuba" /&gt;

[[Saturation diving]] lets professional divers live and work under pressure for days or weeks at a time. After working in the water, the divers rest and live in a dry pressurised [[underwater habitat]] on the bottom or a saturation life support system of pressure chambers on the deck of a [[diving support vessel]], [[oil platform]] or other floating platform at a similar pressure to the work depth. They are transferred between the surface accommodation and the underwater workplace in a pressurised closed [[diving bell]]. Decompression at the end of the dive may take many days, but since it is done only once for a long period of exposure, rather than after each of many shorter exposures, the overall risk of decompression injury to the diver and the total time spent decompressing are reduced. This type of diving allows greater work efficiency and safety.{{sfnp|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2006|loc=Chapter 15 Saturation Diving}}

Commercial divers refer to diving operations where the diver starts and finishes the diving operation at atmospheric pressure as [[Surface-supplied diving|surface oriented]], or bounce diving.&lt;ref name="Rekdal 2004" /&gt; The diver may be deployed from the shore or a diving support vessel and may be transported on a diving {{Diving term|stage}} or in a diving bell. Surface-supplied divers almost always wear [[diving helmet]]s or [[full face diving mask]]s. The bottom gas can be air, [[nitrox]], [[heliox]] or [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]]; the decompression gases may be similar, or may include pure oxygen.&lt;ref name="Imbert 2006" /&gt; Decompression procedures include in-water decompression or [[Decompression practice|surface decompression]] in a [[Diving chamber|deck chamber]].{{sfnp|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2006|loc=Chapter 9 Air Decompression}}

A [[Diving bell#Structure of a typical wet bell|wet bell]] with a gas filled dome provides more comfort and control than a stage and allows for longer time in water. Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can decompress on oxygen at {{convert|12|m|ft|-1}}.&lt;ref name="Imbert 2006" /&gt; Small [[Diving bell#Structure of a typical closed bell|closed bell]] systems have been designed that can be easily mobilised, and include a two-man bell, a handling frame and a chamber for decompression after transfer under pressure (TUP). Divers can breathe air or mixed gas at the bottom and are usually recovered with the chamber filled with air. They decompress on oxygen supplied through built in breathing systems (BIBS) towards the end of the decompression. Small bell systems support bounce diving down to {{convert|120|m|ft}} and for bottom times up to 2 hours.&lt;ref name="Imbert 2006" /&gt;

A relatively portable surface gas supply system using high pressure gas cylinders for both primary and reserve gas, but using the full diver's umbilical system with pneumofathometer and voice communication, is known in the industry as "scuba replacement".&lt;ref name="IMCA D014" /&gt;

[[Surface-supplied diving#Compressor diving|Compressor diving]] is a rudimentary method of surface-supplied diving used in some tropical regions such as the [[Philippines]] and the [[Caribbean]]. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure [[air compressor]] on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds the hose end in his mouth with no demand valve or [[Mouthpiece (scuba)|mouthpiece]] and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.&lt;ref name="Into the Blue" /&gt;

[[Submersible]]s and rigid [[atmospheric diving suit]]s (ADS) enable diving to be carried out in a dry environment at normal atmospheric pressure. An ADS is a small one-person articulated submersible which resembles a [[plate armour|suit of armour]], with elaborate joints to allow bending, while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere. An ADS can be used for dives of up to about {{convert|700|m|ft}} for many hours.  It eliminates the majority of physiological dangers associated with deep diving – the occupant need not decompress, there is no need for special gas mixtures, and there is no danger of [[nitrogen narcosis]] – at the expense of higher cost, complex logistics and loss of dexterity.&lt;ref name="subsea 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thornton 2000" /&gt;

===Unmanned diving===
[[Autonomous underwater vehicle]]s (AUVs) and [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s (ROVs) can carry out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute part of a larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which are controlled and powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs).&lt;ref name="ROVCAT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AUV" /&gt;

Diving may be performed for various reasons, both personal and professional. [[Recreational diving]] is purely for enjoyment and has several specialisations and [[technical diving|technical disciplines]] to provide more scope for varied activities for which specialist training can be offered, such as [[cave diving]], [[wreck diving]], [[ice diving]] and [[deep diving]].&lt;ref name="Technical diving" /&gt;&lt;ref name=richardson1999 /&gt;

There are various aspects of [[professional diving]] that range from part-time work to lifelong careers. Professionals in the recreational dive industry include instructor trainers, dive instructors, assistant instructors, [[divemaster]]s, dive guides, and scuba technicians. Commercial diving is industry related and includes [[civil engineering]] tasks such as in [[oil exploration]], [[offshore construction]], dam maintenance and harbour works.  Commercial divers may also be employed to perform tasks related to marine activities, such as [[naval diving]], including the repair and inspection of boats and ships, [[marine salvage]] or [[aquaculture]].&lt;ref name="OSHA 1910.410" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Careers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sokanu" /&gt;

Other specialist areas of diving include [[military diving]], with a long history of military [[frogmen]] in various roles.  They can perform roles including direct combat, infiltration behind enemy lines, placing mines, [[bomb disposal]] or engineering operations.{{sfnp|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2006|loc=Chapter 1 History of Diving}}

In civilian operations, police forces keep [[police diving]] units to perform search and rescue operations, and to recover evidence. In some cases [[diver rescue]] teams may also be part of a [[fire department]], paramedical service or [[lifeguard]] unit, and this may be classed as [[public safety diving]].&lt;ref name="Robinson 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips 2015" /&gt; There are also professional divers such as [[Underwater photography|underwater photographers]] and [[Videography|videographers]], who record the underwater world, and [[scientific diving|scientific divers]] in fields of study which involve the underwater environment, including [[Marine biology|marine biologists]], [[Geology|geologists]], [[Hydrology|hydrologists]], [[Oceanography|oceanographers]] and [[Underwater archaeology|underwater archaeologists]].{{sfnp|''NOAA Diving Manual''|2001|loc=Chapter 1 History of Diving and NOAA Contributions}}&lt;ref name="Sokanu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CoP Scientific" /&gt;

The choice between scuba and surface-supplied diving equipment is based on both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly commercial diving, may be restricted to surface-supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.&lt;ref name="CoP Inshore" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CoP Scientific" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;

[[Freediving]] as a widespread means of hunting and gathering, both for food and other valuable resources such as [[pearl diving|pearls]] and [[precious coral|coral]], dates from before 4500&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="Edmonds 1975" /&gt; By classical Greek and Roman times [[commercial diving]] applications such as [[sponge diving]] and [[marine salvage]] were established.&lt;ref name="Hendrickse" /&gt; Military diving goes back at least as far as the [[Peloponnesian War]],&lt;ref name="Thucydides" /&gt; with recreational and [[underwater sport|sporting]] applications being a recent development. Technological development in [[ambient pressure]] diving started with stone weights ([[skandalopetra]]) for fast descent.&lt;ref name="Hendrickse" /&gt; The diving bell is one of the earliest types of equipment for underwater work and exploration.&lt;ref name="Bevan1999" /&gt; Its use was first described by [[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BCE.&lt;ref name="Bachrach1998" /&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Kindwall 2004" /&gt; --&gt;  In the 16th and 17th centuries CE, [[diving bell]]s became more useful when a renewable supply of air could be provided to the diver at depth,&lt;ref name="Kindwall 2004" /&gt; and progressed to [[surface-supplied diving]] helmets – in effect miniature diving bells covering the diver's head and supplied with compressed air by [[diving air pump|manually operated pumps]] – which were improved by attaching a waterproof suit to the helmet.&lt;ref name="Kindwall 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Slight" /&gt; In the early 19th century these became the [[standard diving dress]],&lt;ref name="Kindwall 2004" /&gt; which made a far wider range of marine civil engineering and salvage projects practicable.&lt;ref name="Kindwall 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Broadwater 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acott1999" /&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name="davis1955" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bevan 1996" /&gt; --&gt;

Limitations in mobility of the surface-supplied systems encouraged the development of both [[open circuit scuba|open circuit]] and [[rebreather diving|closed circuit scuba]] in the 20th century, which allow the diver a much greater autonomy.&lt;ref name="Rouquayrol" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What is a rebreather" /&gt;&lt;ref name=quick /&gt; These became popular during the [[World War II|Second World War]] for [[frogman|clandestine military operations]], and post-war for [[scientific diving|scientific]], search and rescue, [[media diving]], recreational and [[technical diving]]. The heavy free-flow surface-supplied copper helmets evolved into [[diving helmet#Lightweight demand helmet|lightweight demand helmets]],&lt;ref name="Kindwall 2004" /&gt; which are more economical with breathing gas, important for deeper dives using expensive [[Heliox|helium based breathing mixtures]].  [[Saturation diving]] reduced the risks of DCS for deep and long exposures.{{sfnp|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2006|loc=Chapter 1 History of Diving}}&lt;ref name=davis1955 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kindwall 2004" /&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Pressure1983 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LivingWorking /&gt; --&gt;

An alternative approach was the development of the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century.&lt;ref name="Thornton 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carmagnolle" /&gt; Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and [[autonomous underwater vehicle]]s, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface-supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface-supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.&lt;ref name="Acott1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pieds-lourds" /&gt;

===Physiological discoveries===
{{further|History of decompression research and development}}
[[File:John Scott Haldane 1902.jpg|thumb|upright|John Scott Haldane, 1902|alt= A full height monochrome portrait of a middle-aged white man with a receding hairline and a bushy moustache.]]

By the late 19th century, as salvage operations became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in [[caisson (engineering)|caissons]] and was initially called ''caisson disease''; it was later renamed ''the bends'' because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to [[Grecian bend|stoop]]. Early reports of the disease had been made at the time of [[Charles Pasley]]'s salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes.&lt;ref name="Acott1999" /&gt;

French [[physiology|physiologist]] [[Paul Bert]] was the first to understand it as DCS. His work, ''La Pression barométrique'' (1878), was a comprehensive investigation into the physiological effects of air pressure, both above and below the normal.&lt;ref name=Bert /&gt; He determined that inhaling pressurised air caused [[nitrogen]] to dissolve into the [[bloodstream]]; rapid depressurisation would then release the nitrogen into its gaseous state, forming bubbles that could block the [[blood circulation]] and potentially cause paralysis or death. Central nervous system [[oxygen toxicity]] was also first described in this publication and is sometimes referred to as the "Paul Bert effect".&lt;ref name=Bert /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acott2" /&gt;

[[John Scott Haldane]] designed a [[decompression chamber]] in 1907, and he produced the first [[decompression tables]] for the [[Royal Navy]] in 1908 after extensive experiments with animals and human subjects.&lt;ref name=acott /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boycott Damant and Haldane 1908" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Timetables" /&gt; These tables established a method of decompression in stages – it remains the basis for decompression methods to this day. Following Haldane's recommendation, the maximum safe operating depth for divers was extended to {{convert|61|m|ft}}.{{sfnp|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2006|loc=Chapter 1 History of Diving}}

The US Navy continued research into decompression, and in 1915 the first [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] decompression tables were developed by French and Stilson.&lt;ref name="CarlstonMathias2012" /&gt; Experimental dives were conducted in the 1930s, forming the basis for the 1937 US Navy air decompression tables. Surface decompression and oxygen use were also researched in the 1930s. The US Navy 1957 tables were developed to correct problems found in the 1937 tables.&lt;ref name="Huggins" /&gt;

In 1965 [[Hugh LeMessurier]] and [[Brian Andrew Hills]] published their paper, ''A [[Thermodynamic model of decompression|thermodynamic approach]] arising from a study on Torres Strait diving techniques'', which suggested that decompression following schedules based on conventional models results in asymptomatic bubble formation which must then be re-dissolved at the decompression stops before it can be eliminated. This is slower than allowing the gas to be eliminated while it is still in solution, and indicates the importance of minimising bubble phase gas for efficient decompression.&lt;ref name="LeMessurier and Hills" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RRR6176" /&gt;

[[M.P. Spencer]] showed that Doppler ultrasonic methods can detect venous bubbles in asymptomatic divers,&lt;ref name="pmid1249001" /&gt; and Dr Andrew Pilmanis showed that safety stops reduced bubble formation.&lt;ref name="Huggins" /&gt; In 1981 D.E.

The pathophysiology of DCS is not yet fully understood, but [[decompression practice]] has reached a stage where the risk is fairly low, and most incidences are successfully treated by [[therapeutic recompression]] and [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]]. Mixed [[breathing gas]]es are used to reduce the effects of the hyperbaric environment on ambient pressure divers.&lt;ref name="Huggins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wienke 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Imbert 2004" /&gt;

==Diving environment==
{{main|List of diving environments by type}}
[[File:Plongée sous glace VJ.JPG|thumb|Ice diving|alt= A diver is visible underwater in a hole cut in the ice cover of a small lake. Blocks of ice cut to form the hole are stacked to one side, and a second diver sits on the edge of the hole with his legs in the water. A rough wooden ladder bridges the hole. The dive site is cordoned off with a red and white tape, and other members of the support team stand to the side, with onlookers outside the cordon.]]

The diving environment is limited by accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving is done in the shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and [[ballast tank]]s of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives.&lt;ref name="Graver2010" /&gt; Water temperature, [[underwater vision|visibility]] and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan.&lt;ref name="Jablonski 2006" /&gt; Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team.&lt;ref name="High risk" /&gt;

Benign conditions, sometimes also referred to as confined water, are environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas.&lt;ref name="CoP Benign" /&gt;

Open water is unrestricted water such as a sea, lake or [[Scuba diving quarry|flooded quarry]], where the diver has direct vertical access to the surface of the water in contact with the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Aus Part 3" /&gt; [[Open water diving]] implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere to breathe air.&lt;ref name="Divers dictionary" /&gt; Wall diving is done along a near vertical face. Blue-water diving is done in mid-water where the bottom is out of sight of the diver and there may be no fixed visual reference.&lt;ref name="Haddock and Heine" /&gt;

An overhead or penetration diving environment is where the diver enters a space from which there is no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. [[Cave diving]], [[wreck diving]], [[ice diving]] and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.&lt;ref name="CoP Scientific" /&gt;&lt;ref name="High risk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jablonski 2006" /&gt;

[[Night diving]] can allow the diver to experience a different [[underwater]] environment, because many [[marine animal]]s are [[nocturnal]].&lt;ref name="BSAC" /&gt; [[Altitude diving]], for example in mountain lakes, requires modifications to the decompression schedule because of the reduced atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref name="Jackson 2000" /&gt;{{sfnp|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2006|loc=Chapter 9, Section 13 - Diving at altitude}}

===Depth range===
{{see also|Deep diving}}
[[File:Trevor Jackson returns from SS Kyogle.jpg|thumb|A technical diver using a closed circuit [[rebreather]] with open circuit [[Bailout bottle|bailout cylinders]] returns from a {{convert|600|ft|adj=on}} dive.|alt= A scuba diver in a wetsuit holds onto the shotline at a decompression stop. He is breathing from a rebreather and carrying a side-slung 80 cubic foot aluminium bailout cylinder on each side. A second diver is partly visible to the left.]]

The recreational diving depth limit set by the EN 14153-2 / ISO 24801-2 level 2 "Autonomous Diver" standard is {{convert|20|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="EUF" /&gt; The recommended depth limit for more extensively trained recreational divers ranges from {{convert|30|m|ft}} for PADI divers,&lt;ref name=padi1 /&gt; (this is the depth at which nitrogen narcosis symptoms generally begin to be noticeable in adults), {{convert|40|m|ft}} specified by [[Recreational Scuba Training Council]],&lt;ref name=padi1 /&gt; {{convert|50|m|ft}} for divers of the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] and [[Sub-Aqua Association]] breathing air,&lt;ref name="Cole 2008" /&gt; and {{convert|60|m|ft|-1}} for teams of 2 to 3 French Level 3 recreational divers, breathing air.&lt;ref name="Code du sport" /&gt;

For technical divers, the recommended maximum depths are greater on the understanding that they will use less narcotic gas mixtures. {{convert|100|m|ft}} is the maximum depth authorised for divers who have completed Trimix Diver certification with [[IANTD]]&lt;ref name=IANTD /&gt; or Advanced Trimix Diver certification with [[Technical Diving International|TDI]].&lt;ref name=TDI /&gt; {{convert|332|m|ft}} is the world record depth on scuba (2014).&lt;ref name="GuinnessGabr" /&gt; Commercial divers using saturation techniques and heliox breathing gases routinely exceed {{convert|100|m|ft}}, but they are also limited by physiological constraints. [[Compagnie maritime d'expertises|Comex]] Hydra 8 experimental dives reached a record open water depth of {{convert|534|m|ft}} in 1988.&lt;ref name="Hydra 8" /&gt; ADS are mainly constrained by the technology of the articulation seals, and a US Navy diver has dived to {{convert|610|m|ft}} in one.&lt;ref name="Depth record" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuytco" /&gt;

===Dive sites===
[[File:BlueHole Rohscan bearb 150d.jpg|thumb|The [[Blue Hole (Red Sea)|Blue Hole]] in [[Dahab|Dahab, Egypt]], a world-renowned recreational dive site|alt= View of the coastal waters from the top of a hill, showing an approximately circular hole in the shallow coastal reef tangent to the deeper water offshore.]]

The common term for a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As a general rule, professional diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised [[recreational dive sites]] which are known for their convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions. Diver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the risk is relatively low.&lt;ref name="CoP Training" /&gt;

==Diving procedures==
{{see also|Scuba skills|Surface-supplied diving skills}}
Due to the inherent risks of the environment and the necessity to operate the equipment correctly, both under normal conditions and during incidents where failure to respond appropriately and quickly can have fatal consequences, a set of [[standard procedure]]s are used in preparation of the equipment, preparation to dive, during the dive if all goes according to plan, after the dive, and in the event of a reasonably foreseeable contingency. The standard procedures are not necessarily the only course of action that will have a satisfactory outcome, but they are generally those procedures which have been found by experiment and experience to work well and reliably when applied in response to the given circumstances.&lt;ref name="Larn and Whistler 1993" /&gt; All formal diver training is based on the learning of standard skills and procedures, and in many cases the [[over-learning]] of the skills until the procedures can be performed without hesitation even when distracting circumstances exist. Where reasonably practicable, [[checklist]]s may be used to ensure that preparatory procedures are carried out in the correct sequence and that no steps are inadvertently omitted.&lt;ref name="Ranapurwala et al 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DAN Checklists" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ADCI 2016" /&gt;

Some procedures are common to all manned modes of diving, but most are specific to the mode of diving and many are specific to the equipment in use.&lt;ref name="Class 4 training standard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Class II diver training standard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ADCI 2016" /&gt; Diving procedures are those which are directly relevant to diving safety and efficiency, but do not include task specific skills. Standard procedures are particularly helpful where communication is by hand or rope signal – the [[Diver communications#Hand signals|hand]] and [[Diver communications#Line signals|line signals]] are examples of standard procedures themselves – as the communicating parties have a better idea of what the other is likely to do in response. Where [[Diver communications#Voice communication|voice communication]] is available, [[Diver communications#Voice communication protocol|standardised communications protocol]] reduces the time needed to convey necessary information and the error rate in transmission.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook 6.2" /&gt;

Diving procedures generally involve the correct application of the appropriate diving skills in response to the current circumstances, and range from selecting and testing equipment to suit the diver and the dive plan, to the rescue of oneself or another diver in a life-threatening emergency. In many cases, what might be a life threatening emergency to an untrained or inadequately skilled diver, is a mere annoyance and minor distraction to a skilled diver who applies the correct procedure without hesitation. Professional diving operations tend to adhere more rigidly to standard operating procedures than recreational divers, who are not legally or contractually obliged to follow them, but the prevalence of diving accidents is known to be strongly correlated to human error, which is more common in divers with less training and experience.&lt;ref name="Ranapurwala et al 2015" /&gt; The [[Doing It Right (scuba diving)|Doing It Right]] philosophy of [[technical diving]] is strongly supportive of common standard procedures for all members of a [[Doing It Right (scuba diving)#Unified team|dive team]], and prescribe the procedures and equipment configuration which may affect procedures to the members of their organisations.&lt;!-- Ref Jablonski --&gt;

The terms ''diving skills'' and ''diving procedures'' are largely interchangeable, but a procedure may require the ordered application of several skills, and is a broader term. A procedure may also conditionally branch or require repeated applications of a skill, depending on circumstances. Diver training is structured around the learning and practice of standard procedures until the diver is assessed as competent to apply them reliably in reasonably foreseeable circumstances, and the certification issued limits the diver to environments and equipment that are compatible with their training and assessed skill levels. The teaching and assessment of diving skills and procedures is often restricted to registered [[Diving instructor|instructors]], who have been assessed as competent to teach and assess those skills by the [[Diver certification agencies|certification or registration agency]], who take the responsibility of declaring the diver competent against their [[Educational assessment|assessment]] criteria. The teaching and assessment of other task oriented skills does not generally require a diving instructor.&lt;ref name="ADCI 2016" /&gt;

There is considerable difference in the diving procedures of professional divers, where a diving team with formally appointed members in specific roles and with recognised competence is required by law, and recreational diving, where in most jurisdictions the diver is not constrained by specific laws, and in many cases is not required to provide any evidence of competence.

==Diver training==

{{Main|Recreational diver training}}
{{See also|Scuba skills|Surface-supplied diving skills}}
Underwater diver training is normally given by a qualified [[Diving instructor|instructor]] who is a member of one of many [[List of diver certification organizations|diver training agencies]] or is registered with a government agency. Basic diver training entails the learning of skills required for the safe conduct of activities in an underwater environment, and includes procedures and skills for the use of diving equipment, safety, emergency self-help and rescue procedures, dive planning, and use of dive tables.&lt;ref name="ISO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IDSA" /&gt; [[Diver communications|Diving hand signals]] are used to communicate underwater. Professional divers will also learn other methods of communication.&lt;ref name="ISO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IDSA" /&gt;

An entry level diver must learn the techniques of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at a high risk of drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also learn how to use a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.&lt;ref name="ISO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IDSA" /&gt;

To avoid injury during descent, divers must be competent at equalising the [[Ear clearing|ears]], sinuses and mask; they must also learn not to hold their breath while ascending, to avoid barotrauma of the lungs. The speed of ascent must be controlled to avoid DCS, which requires buoyancy control skills. Good [[Scuba skills#Buoyancy control|buoyancy control]] and [[diver trim|trim]] also allow the diver to manoeuvre and move about safely, comfortably and efficiently, using [[swimfins]] for propulsion.&lt;ref name="ISO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IDSA" /&gt;

Some knowledge of physiology and the [[diving physics|physics of diving]] is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand the effects of the diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, [[buoyancy]], heat loss, and [[light]] underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of [[barotrauma]], DCS, gas toxicity, [[hypothermia]], [[drowning]] and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills.&lt;ref name="ISO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IDSA" /&gt; Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.&lt;ref name="High risk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jablonski 2006" /&gt;{{sfnp|''NOAA Diving Manual''|2001|loc=Chapter 7 Diver and Support Personnel Training}}{{sfnp|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2006|loc=Chapter 1 History of Diving}}

==Medical aspects of diving==
{{see also|Decompression sickness|Barotrauma|Nitrogen narcosis|Oxygen toxicity}}
The medical aspects of diving and hyperbaric exposure include examination of divers to establish medical fitness to dive, diagnosis and treatment of [[diving disorders]], treatment by recompression and [[hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], toxic effects of gases in a hyperbaric environment,&lt;ref name="ECHM-EDTM 2011" /&gt; and treatment of injuries incurred while diving which are not directly associated with depth or pressure.&lt;ref name="Kindwall 2004" /&gt;

===Fitness to dive===
Medical [[fitness to dive]] is the medical and physical suitability of a diver to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver that he or she does not suffer from any of the disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, by a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a [[Diving medicine#Education and registration of practitioners|medical examiner of divers]] following a prescribed procedural checklist, attested by a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner and recorded on a national database, or by alternatives between these extremes.&lt;ref name="Fitness 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;

[[Psychological fitness to dive]] is not normally evaluated before recreational or commercial diver training, but can influence the safety and success of a diving career.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2000" /&gt;

===Diving medicine===
{{see also|Hyperbaric treatment schedules}}
[[File:Decompression chamber.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of the cramped interior of a cylinder containing two benches and two diver trainees|Military and commercial divers are trained in the procedures for use of a [[recompression chamber]] to treat [[diving disorders]].]]
&lt;!--decompression sickness, acute and chronic [[dysbarism|dysbaric disorders]], gas toxicity under pressure including [[oxygen toxicity]], [[nitrogen narcosis]] and [[high pressure neurological syndrome]]--&gt;
[[Diving medicine]] is the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of conditions caused by exposing divers to the underwater environment. It includes the effects on the body of pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how fitness to dive affects a diver's safety. [[Hyperbaric medicine]] is another field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for two of the most important diving-related illnesses, [[decompression sickness|DCS]] and [[air embolism#Decompression illness|arterial gas embolism]].{{sfnp|''US Navy Diving Manual''|2006|loc=Chapter 20 Diagnosis and Treatment of Decompression Sickness and Arterial Gas Embolism}}&lt;ref name="Bove 2013" /&gt;

Diving medicine deals with medical research on issues of diving, the prevention of [[diving disorders]], treatment of diving accident injuries and diving fitness. The field includes the effect on the human body of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure, and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety. In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications. Diving medicine is a branch of [[occupational medicine]] and [[sports medicine]], and first aid and recognition of symptoms of diving disorders are important parts of diver education.&lt;ref name="ECHM-EDTM 2011" /&gt;

{{see also|Diving safety}}
Risk is a combination of hazard, vulnerability and likelihood of occurrence, which can be the probability of a specific undesirable consequence of a hazard, or the combined probability of undesirable consequences of all the hazards of an activity.&lt;ref name="Coppola 2015" /&gt;

The presence of a combination of several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers other hazards with a resulting cascade of incidents. Many diving fatalities are the result of a cascade of incidents overwhelming the diver, who should be able to manage any single reasonably foreseeable incident.&lt;ref name="Blumenberg 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lock 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barsky 2003" /&gt;

Commercial diving operations may expose the diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational health and safety legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept.&lt;ref name="Blumenberg 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lock 2011" /&gt; Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.&lt;ref name="Blumenberg 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lock 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DAWR" /&gt;

Statistics on injuries related to commercial diving are normally collected by national regulators. In the UK the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) is responsible for the overview of about 5,000 commercial divers; in Norway the corresponding authority is the [[Petroleum Safety Authority Norway]] (PSA), which has maintained the DSYS database since 1985, gathering statistics on over 50,000 diver-hours of commercial activity per year.&lt;ref name="QinetiQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DSYS" /&gt; The risks of dying during [[recreational diving|recreational]], [[scientific diving|scientific]] or [[commercial diving]] are small, and for [[scuba diving]], deaths are usually associated with poor [[Scuba skills#Breathing gas management|gas management]], poor [[Scuba skills#Buoyancy control, trim and stability|buoyancy control]], equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error on the part of the victim.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt; According to a North American 1972 analysis of calendar year 1970 data, diving was, based on man hours, 96 times more dangerous than driving a car.&lt;ref name="CalifMed1972" /&gt; According to a 2000 Japanese study, every hour of recreational diving is 36 to 62 times riskier than driving.&lt;ref name="ikeda2000" /&gt;

[[Scuba diving fatalities]] have a major financial impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs.&lt;ref name="Concannon 2011" /&gt; Equipment failure is rare in [[open circuit scuba]], and when the cause of death is recorded as [[drowning]], it is usually the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown.&lt;ref name="Ange 2010" /&gt; Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed [[Scuba skills#Ascents and descents|ascent]], occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data are poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.&lt;ref name="Ange 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caruso 2011" /&gt;

Artisanal fishermen and gatherers of marine organisms in less developed countries may expose themselves to relatively high risk using diving equipment if they do not understand the physiological hazards, particularly if they use inadequate equipment.&lt;ref name="Westin 2005" /&gt;

===Diving hazards===
{{Main|Diving hazards and precautions}}
Divers operate in an environment for which the human body is not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include [[List of diving hazards and precautions#The aquatic environment|the aquatic environment]], the use of [[List of diving hazards and precautions#Use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment|breathing equipment in an underwater environment]], [[List of diving hazards and precautions#Exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes|exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes]], particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. [[List of diving hazards and precautions#Failure of diving equipment other than breathing apparatus|Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus]] is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of [[List of diving hazards and precautions#The specific diving environment|the specific diving environment]], and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include [[List of diving hazards and precautions#Pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions in the diver|pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions]] and the [[List of diving hazards and precautions#Diver behaviour and competence|personal behaviour and competence]] of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional [[List of diving hazards and precautions#Hazards of the dive task and special equipment|hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment]] associated with the task.&lt;ref name="General Hazards" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazards and Solutions" /&gt;

===Human factors===
{{Main|Human factors in diving safety}}
The major factors influencing diving safety are the environment, the diving equipment and the performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.&lt;ref name="Blumenberg 1996" /&gt;

[[Human factors]] are the physical or [[cognitive]] properties of individuals, or social behaviour specific to humans, which influences functioning of technological systems as well as human-environment equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Blumenberg 1996" /&gt; Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time, and the consequences of these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause harm, but in a high risk environment, such as in diving, errors are more likely to have catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents.&lt;ref name="Perrow 1984" /&gt; [[Human error]] and [[panic]] are considered to be the leading causes of diving accidents and fatalities. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career,&lt;ref name="Morgan 1995" /&gt; and these findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water.&lt;ref name="Staff 1996" /&gt; Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgement or performance, and may result in an accident.&lt;ref name="Lock 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morgan 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott 1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shelanski 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vorosmarti 1987" /&gt; The [[safety]] of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur.&lt;ref name="Blumenberg 1996" /&gt;

Only 4.46% of the recreational diving fatalities in a 1997 study were attributable to a single contributory cause.&lt;ref name="PARAS 1997" /&gt; The remaining fatalities probably arose as a result of a progressive sequence of events involving two or more procedural errors or equipment failures, and since procedural errors are generally avoidable by a well-trained, intelligent and alert diver, working in an organised structure, and not under excessive stress, it was concluded that the low accident rate in professional scuba diving is due to this factor.&lt;ref name="Tetlow 2006" /&gt; The study also concluded that it would be impossible to completely eliminate all minor contraindications of scuba diving, as this would result in overwhelming bureaucracy and bring all diving to a halt.&lt;ref name="PARAS 1997" /&gt;

===Risk management===
[[File:Peter Southwood 2.jpg|thumb|alt=A diver is carrying two cylinders, one on his back and the other at his side. |Solo diver managing risk of breathing gas supply failure by carrying a bailout cylinder (slung at the diver's left side)]]

[[Risk management]] is obtained by the usual measures of [[engineering controls]],{{efn|name=Engineering|Engineering methods control the hazard at its source. When feasible, the work environment and the job itself are designed to eliminate hazards or reduce exposure to hazards:&lt;ref name="OHS answers" /&gt; If feasible, the hazard is removed or substituted by something that is not hazardous. If removal is not feasible, the hazard is enclosed to prevent exposure during normal operations. Where complete enclosure is not feasible, barriers are established to limit exposure during normal operations.}} [[administrative controls]] and procedures,{{efn|name=Administration|Safe work practices, appropriate training, medical screening and limiting exposure by rotation of workers, breaks and limits on shift length are forms of administrative controls. They are intended to limit the effect of the hazard on the worker when it cannot be eliminated.&lt;ref name="OHS answers" /&gt;}} and [[personal protective equipment]],{{efn|name=PPE|Personal protective clothing and equipment are required in diving operations as exposure to the inherent hazards cannot be engineered out of normal operations, and safe work practices and management controls cannot provide sufficient protection from exposure. Personnel protective controls assume the hazard will be present and the equipment will prevent injury to those exposed.&lt;ref name="OHS answers" /&gt;}} including [[hazard identification]] and [[risk assessment]] (HIRA), [[protective equipment]], [[Screening (medicine)|medical screening]], [[training]] and [[Standard operating procedure|standardised procedures]].&lt;ref name="Risk management" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OHS answers" /&gt; Professional divers are generally legally obliged to carry out and formally record these measures,&lt;ref name="DAWR" /&gt; and though recreational divers are not legally required to do many of them,&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt; competent recreational divers, and particularly technical divers, generally perform them informally but routinely, and they are an important part of technical diver training. For example, a medical statement or examination for fitness, pre-dive site assessment and briefing, safety drills, thermal protection, equipment redundancy, [[alternative air source]], buddy checks, [[Buddy diving|buddy or team diving]] procedures, [[dive planning]], [[Diver communications|underwater hand signals]], and carrying [[first aid]] and [[Oxygen therapy|oxygen administration]] equipment are all routinely part of technical diving.&lt;ref name="Gurr 2008" /&gt;

==Legal aspects==
{{see also|List of legislation regulating underwater diving}}
Inshore and inland commercial and military diving is regulated by legislation in many countries. Responsibility of the employer, client and diving personnel is specified in these cases; &lt;!--US, Norway, Australia, France, etc refs to be added--&gt;&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DAWR" /&gt; offshore commercial diving may take place in international waters, and is often done following the guidelines of a voluntary membership organisation such as the [[International Marine Contractors Association]] (IMCA), which publishes codes of accepted best practice which their member organisations are expected to follow.&lt;ref name="IMCA D014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMCA" /&gt;

Recreational diver training and dive leading are industry regulated in some countries, and only directly regulated by government in a subset of them. In the UK, HSE legislation includes recreational diver training and dive leading for reward;&lt;ref name="DAWR" /&gt; in the US and South Africa industry regulation is accepted, though non-specific health and safety legislation still applies.&lt;ref name="29 CFR 1910.424" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt; In Israel recreational diving activities are regulated by the Recreational Diving Act, 1979.&lt;ref name="Rec Diving Act 1979" /&gt;

The legal responsibility for recreational diving service providers is usually limited as far as possible by [[waiver]]s which they require the customer to sign before engaging in any diving activity. The extent of responsibility of recreational [[Buddy diving|buddy divers]] is unclear and has been the subject of considerable litigation. It is probable that it varies between jurisdictions. In spite of this lack of clarity, buddy diving is recommended by [[List of diver certification organizations|recreational diver training agencies]] as safer than [[solo diving]], and some service providers insist that customers dive in buddy pairs.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt;&lt;ref name=SPUMShalstead /&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell 2011" /&gt;

To encourage his musical career, she sent him to public schools in affluent [[West Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="oprah1"/&gt; While attending [[John Marshall High School (Los Angeles)|John Marshall High School]], he became best friends with [[apl.de.ap|Allan Pineda]] (stage name apl.de.ap), who was also a future member of The Black Eyed Peas. While still in high school, Adams and Pineda performed in East L.A. clubs and were soon joined by three other entertainers to form the socially conscious rap group, [[Atban Klann]]. Atban Klann caught the eye of [[Compton, California|Compton]] rapper [[Eazy-E]] and was signed to his label, [[Ruthless Records]] in 1992.

Adams used to attend raves while in high school. He later said his history with [[rave culture]] is why he chose a more electro sound for [[The Black Eyed Peas]]' albums ''[[The E.N.D.]]'' and ''[[The Beginning (The Black Eyed Peas album)|The Beginning]]''. Despite the use of [[Electro music|electro]] and [[house music]] elements, will.i.am prefers to separate the underground from pop. In an article with ''[[LA Times|Los Angeles Times]]'', he mentions that secrecy over the whereabouts of [[rave party|raves]] is what made ''raving'' special, and different from the [[mainstream]].&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/05/william-rave-dance-music-convergence-daisy.html |title=The L.A.

That's what people don't understand." |publisher=latimesblogs.latimes.com|accessdate=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==

===1988–2000: Formations and The Black Eyed Peas===
[[File:Flickr - moses namkung - Black Eyed Peas 1.jpg|thumb|will.i.am performing with [[The Black Eyed Peas]] in June 2009]]
In the summer of 1988 will.i.am began his music career when, as an eighth-grader, he met up with fellow rapper Allan Pineda ([[apl.de.ap]]) and fellow student Dante Santiago. They began performing together around Los Angeles and were soon discovered by rapper/entrepreneur [[Eazy-E]], who signed them to his label [[Ruthless Records]] in 1992. At the time, Will was known as "Will 1X". Atban Klann's first ever official track, "Merry Muthafuckin' Xmas", was included on Eazy-E's EP ''[[5150: Home 4 tha Sick]]''. After this, the trio began recording an album, "Grass Roots", with the help of producers Mookie Mook and DJ Motiv8, but the album was never released due to Eazy-E's death in 1995. After Eazy's tragic death, they changed their name to Black Eyed Pods, and Will replaced Dante with Jaime Gomez, better known under his stage name of Taboo. In 1997, they once again changed their name, this time to [[The Black Eyed Peas]], and began recording their first album, ''[[Behind the Front]]'', with the help of soul singer [[Kim Hill (soul musician)|Kim Hill]]. They were soon signed to [[Interscope Records]], and released their debut single, "[[Joints &amp; Jam]]", in early 1998. The album was successful enough for the group's contract to be renewed, and in 2000, a second album, ''[[Bridging the Gap (Black Eyed Peas album)|Bridging the Gap]]'', was released.

===2000–2003: ''Lost Change'', ''Elephunk'' and ''Must B 21''===
Following the release of ''Bridging the Gap'', Will began recording his first solo release, ''[[Lost Change]]'', which was the official soundtrack to the film of the same name. Featuring collaborations with Medusa, [[Planet Asia]] and Terry Dexter, the album was a critical success.

In November 2001, work began on a third Black Eyed Peas album, ''[[Elephunk]]''. Development of the album began on November 2, 2001 and was released just under two years later in 2003. At the time of development, only will.i.am, [[apl.de.ap]] and [[Taboo (rapper)|Taboo]] were to feature on the album. During the production of "[[Shut Up (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Shut Up]]" (the second single released from the album), they realized that a female vocal would work well with the song. Originally, [[Nicole Scherzinger]] (lead singer of [[The Pussycat Dolls]]) was approached to make a guest appearance on the record. She was forced to decline because she already was signed to a contract with [[Eden's Crush]]. Danté Santiago then introduced [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]] to will.i.am, who was impressed with her vocal talents. She immediately formed a bond with the band and became a permanent member of the Peas and her photo was printed onto the album cover. Nine out of the fourteen tracks were composed by lyricist Robbie Fisher, who has been working closely with the band since the beginning stages of the album. In the United States, ''Elephunk'' reached number 14 on the ''[[Billboard Top 200]]'' and is their first album to chart in the top 15. It gained even more commercial success in the [[UK Album Charts]] where it reached number 3. It has sold over 1.6&amp;nbsp;million copies in the UK and 8.5&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Amazon Elephunk Information |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00009V7RF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singles "[[Where Is the Love?]]" and "[[Shut Up (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Shut Up]]" reached number 1. "[[Hey Mama (The Black Eyed Peas song)|Hey Mama]]" has been used for several advertisements including advertisements for [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[iTunes]]. "[[Let's Get It Started]]" also received universal acclaim in the media section where a cover version of the song appears in the film ''[[Hot Tub Time Machine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hot Tub Time Machine Interview |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Hot-Tub-Time-Machine-Director-Steve-Pink-17768.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of ''Elephunk'', the Peas were approached by EA games to feature some of their music on the 2004 game ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City|The Urbz]]''. They remixed some of the tracks on Elephunk and translated it into [[Simlish]] and created new tracks for the game. They also feature in the game as playable characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Eyed Peas To Feature In The Urbz: Sims In The City |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6105705.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103011755/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6105705.html |archivedate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group released their breakthrough single, "[[Where Is The Love]]", in November 2002 (featuring [[Justin Timberlake]], although he did not appear in the video). On the strength of that single and follow-up singles like "[[Shut Up]]", ''Elephunk'' went on to sell 8.5&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide. During this time, Will recorded a second solo album, ''[[Must B 21]]''. In 2002, Will recorded the song "Secrets" for the soundtrack to ''[[Dexter's Laboratory: The Hip-Hop Experiment]]'', a musical accompaniment to the [[Cartoon Network]] original series. Prior to this, he had also composed the theme music for another [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] series, ''[[Samurai Jack]]''.

===2003–2006: ''Monkey Business''===
In November 2003, work began on a fourth Black Eyed Peas album, entitled ''[[Monkey Business (album)|Monkey Business]]'', the second album with new band member [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]. Upon the success of ''Monkey Business'', which was released in 2005, the album was [[RIAA certification|certified]] three times [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the U.S. and has sold over 10&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide. The [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]] (or CRIA) has certified ''Monkey Business'' 6x Platinum, with sales of over 600,000 copies. The [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (or ARIA) has also certified ''Monkey Business'' 6x Platinum, denoting sales of over 420,000 copies. The album's tracks earned the group four 2006 [[Grammy Award]] nominations and they also won the Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] for "Don't Phunk with My Heart". According to [[IFPI]], over 2&amp;nbsp;million copies have been sold in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifpi.org/site-content/platinum/platinum_intro.html] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20060822101529/http://www.ifpi.org/site-content/platinum/platinum_intro.html |date=August 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK alone, it has sold over 1&amp;nbsp;million copies, although this is significantly lower than their sales of ''Elephunk'', which stand at over 1.6&amp;nbsp;million copies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigbuilderonline.com/industry-news.asp?sectionID=363&amp;articleID=1035781 |title=Big Builder - Home Building Industry News and Archive Information |publisher=''Builder Online'' |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 10&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.
the band announced they were going to take a break to focus on their own personal projects. Will went on to produce Ferguson's first solo album, ''[[The Dutchess]]'', which was released in 2006, before beginning work with [[Michael Jackson]], who had requested Will's expertise for the recording and production of his new album. Work began on the Jackson album in 2006, and continued until the singer's death in 2009, at which point will.i.am revealed that none of the material recorded during the period would be released. However, remixes recorded for Jackson's ''[[Thriller 25]]'' anniversary album were released in 2008.

===2007–2009: ''Songs About Girls'' and ''Change Is Now''===
[[File:Hancock, Crow, and will.i.am at We Are One.jpg|thumb|will.i.am with [[Sheryl Crow]] and [[Herbie Hancock]] performing [[We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial]] concert]]
In 2007, will.i.am announced that he had co-created an all-female soul band entitled the [[Paradiso Girls]], who he intended to work with on an upcoming solo project. The album, ''[[Songs About Girls]]'', was released in 2007. The album spawned three singles, "I Got It From My Mama", "One More Chance" and "Heartbreaker", and fared slightly better than his previous solo efforts, however, failed to shift more than 75,000 copies. Will also did a remix to the song [[With Love (Hilary Duff song)|With Love]] by actress and singer [[Hilary Duff]].

In 2008, will.i.am contributed the song "One Tribe" to the [[Survival International]] charity album, ''[[Songs for Survival]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/amazonalbum |title=Songs for Survival – Survival International |publisher=Survivalinternational.org |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swift |first=Jacqui |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/sftw/article1819510.ece |title=Bruce Parry says he owes the tribal people so much.

In January 2008, will.i.am announced plans that he was masterminding a political album, ''[[Change is Now: Renewing America's Promise]]'', in support of Barack Obama's presidential campaign. The first single, "[[Yes We Can (will.i.am song)|Yes We Can]]", featured a music video directed by [[Jesse Dylan]].
