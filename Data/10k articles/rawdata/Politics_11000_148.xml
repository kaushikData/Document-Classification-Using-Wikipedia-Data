She was criticised for failure to tackle Madrid's air pollution which frequently exceeded permitted levels while she was responsible for the city's environment.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Rainsford (2011), [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12393803 "Madrid in smog warning to commuters"]&lt;/ref&gt; Botella was an outspoken [[climate change skeptic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/ana-botella-deeply-unpopular-madrid-mayor-study-political-falls-grace-911908 Ana Botella, Deeply Unpopular Madrid Mayor, A Study In Political Falls From Grace]&lt;/ref&gt;

Botella was sworn in as mayor on 27 December 2011, after having been deputy mayor to [[Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón]], mayor of the capital from 2003, who had resigned to serve as [[Ministry of Justice (Spain)|Justice Minister]] in the new government formed by Prime Minister [[Mariano Rajoy]].

On 9 September 2014 Ana Botella called a press conference after having cancelled all her appointments where she announced that she would not be running in the May 2015 municipal elections for mayor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/09/09/inenglish/1410277593_497642.html May 2015 elections for mayor]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ausflag''' is an organization that was established to promote a new [[flag of Australia]].  

Ausflag was formed in 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/ray-martin-leads-push-for-new-flag-20100125-msu3.html |agency=AAP |title=Ray Martin leads push for new flag |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Harold Scruby who has since worked to foster debate on the design of the flag. Prominent Australians that have been involved in the direction of Ausflag include [[Nicholas Whitlam]], [[Phillip Adams]], [[Cathy Freeman]], [[Malcolm Turnbull]], [[Janet Holmes à Court]] and [[Nick Greiner]]. Former chair of the [[Australian Republican Movement]] Malcolm Turnbull left the board of Ausflag in 1994 after being asked for his resignation and in 2004 joined the [[Australian National Flag Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ausflag.com.au/malcolm_turnbull_letters.asp |website=AusFlag |title=The Turnbull Letters |accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group is affiliated with [[NZFlag]], a trust promoting a redesign of the [[Flag of New Zealand]].

==Campaigns==
Ausflag has promoted design competitions for a new flag in 1986 before the [[Australian Bicentenary|bicentenary]], in 1993 after Sydney won the right to host the 2000 Olympics, and in 1998, before the new millennium.&lt;ref name="SMH 2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/eminent-australians-rally-around-as-call-goes-out-for-a-new-flag-20110125-1a4b5.html |last=Huxley |first=John |title=Eminent Australians rally around as call goes out for a new flag |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 the organisation drafted a statement in support of a new flag, which has been signed by over a dozen [[Australian of the Year]] recipients, including [[Patrick McGorry]], [[Ian Kiernan]], [[Dawn Fraser]], [[Shane Gould]], [[Ian Frazer]], [[Gustav Nossal]] and [[Tim Flannery]].&lt;ref name="SMH 2011"/&gt;

On Australia Day 2013, Ausflag launched a seventh flag design, a concept for an Australian Sporting Flag. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/ausflag-unveils-new-aussie-flag-to-be-used-at-sporting-events/story-e6frg6n6-1226561280074 |title=Ausflag unveils new Aussie flag to be used at sporting events |first=Patrick |last=Lion |newspaper=The Australian |publisher=News Limited |date=25 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australianflag.net.au/ |title=Australian Flag |publisher=Australian National Flag Association of Queensland}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date none of the flag designs promoted by the organisation has achieved customary use. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.australianflag.org.au/georrfrey-blainey/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604040346/http://www.australianflag.org.au/georrfrey-blainey/ |archivedate=4 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1735">The '''Bandiera Rossa Association''' ('''Associazione Bandiera Rossa''') is an association of members of the [[Critical Left]] party in Italy. Politically it is [[Trotskyist]]  and is the Italian affiliate of the  [[Unified Secretariat of the Fourth International]] (USFI). Bandiera Rossa is a left wing current. "Bandiera Rossa" is [[Italian language|Italian]] for "[[Red flag (politics)|Red flag]]".

It originated in the late 1940s as the Revolutionary Communist Group (GCR) and was led by [[Livio Maitan]] who remained a leading fixture in both the GCR and its successor organisations and the USFI until his death in 2004.

In 1979 despite having lost many of the membership gains accrued through entrist work in the Communist Youth the GCR renamed itself the Revolutionary Communist League (LCR). It grew moderately, despite elements growing dissatisfied and leaving to form rival Trotskyist groups, through the recruitment of students and work in the factories. It took part in various electoral blocs in the late 1970s.

When much of the Italian far left formed the organisation Democrazia Proletaria ([[Proletarian Democracy]]) the LCR joined it as a recognised faction. Later still when the PRC was founded the former LCR argued for Democrazia Proletaria to dissolve into the larger formation.

      <comment>Misleading and false comparison that claims the United States spends less than $50 billion on education per year.

This was done by comparing the budget of the US department of education (~50 billion) to the black ops budget.

The US department of education does not fund any schools in the USA.</comment>

A '''black budget''' is a [[government budget]] that is allocated for classified or other secret operations of a nation. The black budget is an account expenses and spending related to [[Military science|military research]] and [[covert operation]]s. The black budget is mostly classified due to security reasons.

The black budget can be complicated to calculate, but in the United States it has been estimated to be over US$50 billion a year.&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;

==United States==
[[File:US intelligence budget.png|thumb|300px|Data visualization of U.S. intelligence black budget (2013)]]

The [[United States Department of Defense]] has a black budget it uses to fund [[black project]]s—expenditures that it does not want to disclose publicly. The annual cost of the United States Department of Defense black budget was estimated at $30 billion in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/science/01patc.html?8dpc |work=The New York Times |title=Inside the Black Budget |first=William J. |last=Broad |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was increased to an estimated $50 billion in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shachtman|first=Noah |authorlink=Noah Shachtman|url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2009/05/pentagons-black-budget-grows-to-more-than-50-billion/|title=Pentagon's Black Budget Grows to More Than $50 Billion|work=Wired|date=7 May 2009|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A black budget article by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', based on information given by [[Edward Snowden]], detailed how the US allocated $52.8 billion in 2012 for the black budget.&lt;ref name=WaPo&gt;{{cite news|first1=Barton |last1=Gellman |first2=Greg |last2=Miller|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/black-budget-summary-details-us-spy-networks-successes-failures-and-objectives/2013/08/29/7e57bb78-10ab-11e3-8cdd-bcdc09410972_story.html  |title=‘Black budget’ summary details U.S. spy network’s successes, failures and objectives |work=The Washington Post |date=29 August 2013|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The black budget has been known to hide multiple types of projects from elected officials. With secret code names and hidden figures, the details of the black budget are revealed only to certain people of congress, if at all.

This budget was approved by the US [[National Security Act of 1947]], they created the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[National Security Council]] and reorganized some military bases with help of the Defense Department.

The U.S. Government claims that the money given to this budget investigates advanced sciences and technologies for military issues. This kind of research is responsible for the creation of new aircraft, weapons, and satellites. 

In 2018, some newspapers reported that the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] asked for $81.1 billion for the 2019 black budget. The request included $59.9 billion for the National Intelligence Program, covering non-military programs and activities. Also $21.2 billion for the Military Intelligence Program which covers Intelligence activities by the Department of Defense. [http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2018/02/28/Trump-Administration-Asks-811-Billion-Black-Budget-Largest-Ever] “In total, these two are more than 3.4% higher than the [[Fiscal Year|FY2018]] request and the largest since then... [and it's] the largest announced since the government began disclosing its intelligence budget request in 2007..." according to [[The Washington Times]]' Andrew Blake.

==Russia==
According to an estimate by the Moscow-based {{ill|Gaidar Institute|ru|Институт экономической политики имени Е. Т. Гайдара}}, about 21% (3.2 trillion rubles) of the [[Federal budget of Russia|Russian federal budget]] was "black" (not itemized) in 2015. This represents a doubling from 2010. The increase coincided with huge increases in the [[Military budget of the Russian Federation|Russian military budget]] under Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Biryukov|first=Andrey|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-02/putin-s-secret-budget-hides-shift-toward-war-economy| title=The Secret Money Behind Vladimir Putin's War Machine|date=2 June 2015|publisher=Bloomberg|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of '''blindness and education''' has included evolving approaches and public perceptions of how best to address the special needs of blind students. The practice of institutionalizing the [[blindness|blind]] in asylums has a history extending back over a thousand years, but it was not until the 18th century that authorities created schools for them where blind children, particularly those more privileged, were usually educated in such specialized settings. These institutions provided simple vocational and adaptive training, as well as grounding in academic subjects offered through alternative formats. Literature, for example, was being made available to blind students by way of embossed Roman letters.

==Ancient Egypt==
The Ancient Egyptians were the first civilisation to display an interest in the causes and cures for disabilities and during some periods blind people are recorded as representing a substantial portion of the poets and musicians in society.&lt;ref&gt;"''Everybody belongs''", Arthur H. Shapiro, p. 152, Routledge, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8153-3960-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2040-1640 BCE), [[Harper's Songs|blind harpists]] are depicted on tomb walls.&lt;ref name="Middle Egyptian p343"/&gt; They were not exclusively interested in the causes and cures for blindness but also the social care of the individual.&lt;ref name=Winzer/&gt;

==Early institutions for the blind==
Asylums for the Industrious Blind were established in [[Edinburgh]] and [[Bristol]] in 1765, but the first school anywhere, to expressly teach the blind was set up by Henry Dannett in [[Liverpool]] as the School for the Instruction of the Indigent Blind. It taught the blind children skills in manual crafts although there was no formal education as such. Other institutions set up at that time were: the School for the Indigent Blind in [[London]] and the Asylum and School for the Indigent Blind at [[Norwich]].

In [[France]], the [[Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles]] was established in 1784 by [[Valentin Haüy]]. Haüy's impulse to help the blind began when he witnessed the blind being mocked during a religious street festival.{{sfn|Herbermann|1913}} In May 1784, at [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]], he met a young beggar, [[François Lesueur]]; he was his first student. He developed a method of raised letters, to teach Lesueur to read, and compose sentences. He made rapid progress, and Haüy announced the success, in September 1784 in the ''[[Journal de Paris]]'', then receiving encouragement from the [[French Academy of Sciences]].

With the help of the Philanthropic Society Haüy founded the Institute for Blind Youth, the [[Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles]], in February 1785. Building on the philanthropic spinning workshop for the blind, the institution of Blind Children was dedicated on 26 December 1786. Its purpose was to educate students and teach them manual work: spinning, and letterpress.

Attempts to actually educate the blind were first attempted towards the end of the century. Until that time they were considered mostly ineducable and un-trainable. One of the major figures in the movement to educate the blind was [[Sébastien Guillié]]. He established the first [[ophthalmology|ophthalmological]] clinic in France and became director of the school in Paris.

==Braille system==
[[Louis Braille]] attended Haüy's school in 1819 and later taught there. He soon became determined to fashion a system of reading and writing that could bridge the critical gap in communication between the sighted and the blind. In his own words: "Access to communication in the widest sense is access to knowledge, and that is vitally important for us if we [the blind] are not to go on being despised or patronized by condescending sighted people. We do not need pity, nor do we need to be reminded we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals – and communication is the way this can be brought about."&lt;ref name=Olmstrom&gt;Olmstrom, pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Braille alfabet.jpg|thumb|right|Alphabet chart for English [[braille]]. The letter "W" is not part of the French alphabet, and was only appended to the additional letters with diacritics.]]
In 1821, Braille learned of a communication system devised by Captain [[Charles Barbier]] of the French Army.&lt;ref&gt;Kugelmass (1951), pp. 108–115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marsan"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.avh.asso.fr/rubriques/infos_braille/actes/Louis%20Braille%20-%20a%20brief%20overview.htm |title=Louis Braille: A Brief Overview |author=Marsan, Colette |year=2009 |publisher=Association Valentin Haüy |accessdate=7 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RNIB&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnib.org.uk/aboutus/aboutsightloss/famous/Pages/louisbraille.aspx |title=Who was Louis Braille? |year=2010 |publisher=Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) |accessdate=7 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbier's "[[night writing]]", was a code of dots and dashes impressed into thick paper. These impressions could be interpreted entirely by the fingers, letting soldiers share information on the battlefield without having light or needing to speak.&lt;ref name=Farrell96&gt;Farrell, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The captain's code turned out to be too complex to use in its original military form, but it inspired Braille to develop a system of his own.&lt;ref&gt;Kugelmass (1951), pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Braille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and his system was largely completed by 1824, when he was just fifteen years of age.&lt;ref name=Olmstrom/&gt;&lt;ref name=Farrell98&gt;Farrell, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; From Barbier's night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published his system [[1829 braille|in 1829]], and by the second edition in 1837 had discarded the dashes because they were too difficult to read. Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger.&lt;ref name=Farrell98/&gt;

==Education for the blind==
The first school with a focus on proper education was the Yorkshire School for the Blind in England. Established in 1835, it taught arithmetic, reading and writing, while at the school of the [[London Society for Teaching the Blind to Read]] founded in 1838 a general education was seen as the ideal that would contribute the most to the prosperity of the blind. Educator Thomas Lucas introduced the Lucas Type, an early form of embossed text different from the Braille system.

Another important institution at the time was the General Institution for the Blind at [[Birmingham]] (1847), which included training for industrial jobs alongside a more general [[curriculum]]. The first school for blind adults was founded in 1866 at [[Worcester]] and was called the College for the Blind Sons of Gentlemen.

In 1889 the Edgerton Commission published a report that recommended that the blind should receive compulsory education from the age of 5–16 years. The law was finally passed in 1893, as an element of the broader Elementary Education Act. This act ensured that blind people up to the age of 16 years were entitled to an Elementary-Level Education as well as to Vocational Training.

The 1880s also saw the introduction of compulsory elementary education for the Blind throughout the United States. (However, most states of the United States did not pass laws specifically making elementary education compulsory ''for the blind'' until after 1900.&lt;ref&gt;''The Blind: Their Condition and the Work Being Done for Them in the United States'', Harry Best, p372, The Macmillan Company, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;){{clarify|date=October 2012}}

[[File:Blind children examining taxidermied reptiles and preserved shells (Sunderland Museum, June 1913).jpg|thumb|alt=1910s photo of school children being taught to use touch to identify various creatures at Sunderland Museum.|Children from the Sunderland Council Blind School using touch to identify different creatures at [[Sunderland Museum]], 1910s.]]
By this time, reading codes - chiefly [[Braille]] and [[New York Point]] - had gained favor among educators as embossed letters (such as [[Moon type]] were said by some to be difficult to learn and cumbersome to use, and so (DOT CODES) were either newly created or imported from well-established schools in Europe. Though New York Point was widely accepted for a time, Braille has since emerged the victor in what some blindness historians have dubbed “the War of the Dots.”

The more respected residential schools were staffed by competent teachers who kept abreast of the latest developments in educational theory. While some of their methods seem archaic by today’s standards - particularly where their Vocational Training options are concerned - their efforts did pave the way for the education and integration of blind students in the 20th century. &lt;!--What is blind?--&gt;

The early 20th century saw a handful of blind students enrolled in their neighborhood schools, with special educational supports. Most still attended residential institutions, but that number dropped steadily as the years wore on - especially after the white cane was adopted into common use as a mobility tool and symbol of blindness in the 1930s.

==Aniruddha’s Bank for The Blind==

An estimated 253 million people live with vision impairment: 36 million are blind and 217 million have moderate to severe vision impairment in the world with nearly 80 lakhs in India itself out of which number of blind students is close to 30 lakhs. Blind students continue to study with huge efforts and surmounting all obstacles with positive attitude. As per the law of nature, when one sensory organ does not function in human body, the other sensory organs become more active to compensate the defect. In case of blind person, hearing and touch are very active and play an important role.
[[Aniruddha%27s Bank for the Blind#|Aniruddha’s Bank for The Blind]] conceptualized and operationalized by Shree Aniruddha Upasana Foundation, Mumbai, India supports the education for blind in an affectionate and unique way. The bank, records the study curriculum in 12 languages like English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Kannada, Bengali, Malayalam, Telugu, Sanskrit and so on by the people who are well versed in their own mother tongue. Till date, the recorded CDs have made a difference in the lives of blind people in almost 26 states of India and a few regions of neighbouring country Pakistan too. The bank maintains high quality and standard of the CDs by regular and diligent verification.

==Today==
[[File:Honolulu-Library-for-Blind&amp;Handicapped.JPG|left|thumb|Waikiki-Kapahulu Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]]]
Most blind and visually impaired students now attend their neighborhood schools{{where|date=February 2016}}, often aided in their educational pursuits by regular teachers of academics and by a team of professionals who train them in alternative skills: Orientation and Mobility (O and M) training - instruction in independent travel - is usually taught by contractors educated in that area, as is Braille.

Blind children may also need special training in understanding spatial concepts, and in self-care, as they are often unable to learn visually and through imitation as other children do. Moreover, [[home economics]] and education dealing with [[anatomy]] are necessary for children with severe visual impairments.

Since only ten percent of those registered as legally blind have no usable [[Visual perception|vision]], many students are also taught to use their remaining sight to maximum effect, so that some read print (with or without optical aids) and travel without canes.

A combination of necessary training tailored to the unique needs of each student, and solid academics, is going a long way towards producing blind and visually impaired students capable of dealing with the world independently.

{{Constitutional history of Canada}}

The '''''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms''''' ({{lang-fr|La Charte canadienne des droits et libertés}}), in Canada often simply the '''Charter''', is a [[bill of rights]] entrenched in the [[Constitution of Canada]]. It forms the first part of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]''. The Charter guarantees certain [[Politics of Canada|political]] rights to Canadian citizens and [[civil rights]] of everyone in [[Canada]] from the policies and actions of all areas and levels of the [[Government of Canada|government]]. It is designed to unify [[Canadians]] around a set of principles that embody those rights. The Charter was signed into law by [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen Elizabeth II of Canada]] on April 17, 1982, along with the rest of the Act.

The Charter was preceded by the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]], which was enacted in 1960. However, the Bill of Rights is only a federal [[statute]], rather than a constitutional document. As a federal statute, it can be amended through the ordinary legislative process and has no application to provincial laws. The Supreme Court of Canada also narrowly interpreted the Bill of Rights and the Court was reluctant to declare laws inoperative.&lt;ref&gt;Only one federal law was declared inoperative by the Supreme Court of Canada: ''[[R.&amp;nbsp;v. Drybones]]'' (1969), [1970] S.C.R. 282. For an example of the narrow interpretation of the Supreme Court of Canada see Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell, [1974] S.C.R. 1349.&lt;/ref&gt; The relative ineffectiveness of the Canadian Bill of Rights motivated many to improve rights protections in Canada. The movement for [[human right]]s and freedoms that emerged after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] also wanted to entrench the principles enunciated in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 689.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Parliament formally enacted the Charter as a part of the'' [[Canada Act 1982]]'' at the request of the [[Parliament of Canada]] in 1982, the result of the efforts of the government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]].

One of the most notable effects of the adoption of the Charter was to greatly expand the scope of [[judicial review]], because the Charter is more explicit with respect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the Bill of Rights. The [[Court system of Canada|courts]], when confronted with violations of Charter rights, have struck down unconstitutional federal and provincial statutes and regulations or parts of statutes and regulations, as they did when [[Law of Canada|Canadian case law]] was primarily concerned with resolving issues of [[Canadian federalism|federalism]]. The Charter, however, granted new powers to the courts to enforce remedies that are more creative and to exclude more evidence in trials. These powers are greater than what was typical under the [[common law]] and under a system of government that, influenced by Canada's parent country the [[United Kingdom]], was based upon [[Parliamentary supremacy]]. As a result, the Charter has attracted both broad support from a majority of the Canadian electorate and criticisms by opponents of increased [[judicial power]]. The Charter only applies to government laws and actions (including the laws and actions of federal, provincial, and municipal governments and public school boards), and sometimes to the common law, not to private activity.

==Features==
{{Canadian Charter}}
Under the Charter, people physically present in Canada have numerous civil and political rights. Most of the rights can be exercised by any legal person (the Charter does not define the corporation as a "legal person"),&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed., pages 741–742&lt;/ref&gt; but a few of the rights belong exclusively to natural persons, or (as in sections 3 and 6) only to [[Canadian nationality law|citizens of Canada]]. The rights are enforceable by the courts through [[Section Twenty-four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 24]] of the Charter, which allows courts discretion to award remedies to those whose rights have been denied. This section also allows courts to exclude evidence in trials if the evidence was acquired in a way that conflicts with the Charter and might damage the reputation of the justice system. [[Section 32 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 32]] confirms that the Charter is binding on the federal government, the territories under its authority, and the provincial governments.
The rights and freedoms enshrined in 34 sections of the Charter include:

===Exceptions===
Precluding all the freedoms and forming the basis of the Charter, the [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|very first section]], known as ''limitations clause'', allows governments to justify certain infringements of Charter rights. Every case in which a court discovers a violation of the Charter would therefore require a section 1 analysis to determine if the law can still be upheld. Infringements are upheld if the purpose for the government action is to achieve what would be recognized as an urgent or important objective in a free society, and if the infringement can be "demonstrably justified." Section 1 has thus been used to uphold laws against objectionable conduct such as [[hate speech]] (e.g., in ''[[R. v. Keegstra]]'') and [[obscenity]] (e.g., in ''[[R. v. Butler]]''). Section 1 also confirms that the rights listed in the Charter are guaranteed.

In addition,  some of these rights are also subjected to the ''notwithstanding clause'' ([[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 33]]). The notwithstanding clause authorizes governments to temporarily override the rights and freedoms in sections 2 and 7–15 for up to five years, subject to renewal. The Canadian federal government has never invoked it, and some have speculated that its use would be politically costly.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Scoffield, "Ottawa rules out invoking notwithstanding clause to stop migrant ships," Canadian Press, September 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the notwithstanding clause was invoked routinely by the province of [[Quebec]] (which did not support the enactment of the Charter but is subject to it nonetheless). The provinces of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]] have also invoked the notwithstanding clause, to end a [[strike action|strike]] and to protect an exclusively [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|heterosexual definition]] of marriage,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/ab/laws/sta/m-5/20060217/whole.html Marriage Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113082005/http://www.canlii.org/ab/laws/sta/m-5/20060217/whole.html |date=2007-01-13 }}, R.S.A. 2000, c. M-5. Accessed URL on March 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. (Note that Alberta's use of the notwithstanding clause is of no force or effect, since the definition of marriage is federal not provincial jurisdiction.)&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, Peter. "Notwithstanding what?" ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'', January 21, 2006, pg. C.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The territory of Yukon also passed legislation once that invoked the notwithstanding clause, but the legislation was never proclaimed in force.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Parliament, Parliamentary Information and Research Service, [http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/bp194-e.htm#Section The Notwithstanding Clause of the Charter], prepared by David Johansen, 1989, as revised May 2005. Retrieved August 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamental freedoms===
::[[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 2:]] which lists what the Charter calls "fundamental freedoms" namely [[freedom of conscience]], [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of thought]], [[freedom of belief]], [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of the press]] and of other media of communication, [[freedom of assembly|freedom of peaceful assembly]], and [[freedom of association]].

===Democratic rights===
Generally, the right to participate in political activities and the right to a [[democracy|democratic]] form of government are protected:
::[[Section Three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 3:]] the right to [[voting|vote]] and to be eligible to serve as member of a [[Legislative Assemblies of Canada's provinces and territories|legislature]].
::[[Section Four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 4:]] the maximum duration of legislatures is set at five years.
::[[Section Five of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 5:]] an annual sitting of legislatures is required as a minimum.

===Mobility rights===
::[[Section Six of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 6]]: protects the mobility rights of Canadian citizens which include the right to enter, remain in, and leave Canada. Citizens and Permanent Residents have the ability to move to and take up residence in any province to pursue gaining livelihood.

===Legal rights===
Rights of people in dealing with the justice system and law enforcement are protected, namely:
::[[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 7:]] right to life, liberty, and security of the person.
::[[Section Eight of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 8:]] freedom from unreasonable [[search and seizure]].
::[[Section Nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 9:]] freedom from arbitrary detention or imprisonment.
::[[Section Ten of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 10:]] right to legal counsel and the guarantee of [[habeas corpus]].
::[[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 11:]] rights in criminal and penal matters such as the right to be [[presumption of innocence|presumed innocent]] until proven guilty.
::[[Section Twelve of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 12:]] right not to be subject to [[cruel and unusual punishment]].
::[[Section Thirteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 13:]] rights against self-incrimination.
::[[Section Fourteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 14:]] rights to an interpreter in a court proceeding.

===Equality rights===
::[[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 15:]] equal treatment before and under the law, and equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination.

===Language rights===
Generally, people have the right to use either the [[English language|English]] or [[French language]] in communications with Canada's federal government and certain provincial governments. Specifically, the language laws  in the Charter include:
::[[Section Sixteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 16:]] English and French are the official languages of Canada and [[New Brunswick]].
::[[Section Sixteen One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 16.1:]] the English and French-speaking communities of New Brunswick have equal rights to [[Education in Canada|educational]] and [[Culture of Canada|cultural]] institutions.
::[[Section Seventeen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 17:]] the right to use either official language in [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] or the New Brunswick legislature.
::[[Section Eighteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 18:]] the statutes and proceedings of Parliament and the New Brunswick legislature are to be printed in both official languages.
::[[Section Nineteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 19:]] both official languages may be used in federal and New Brunswick courts.
::[[Section Twenty of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 20:]] the right to communicate with and be served by the federal and New Brunswick governments in either official language.
::[[Section Twenty-one of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 21:]] other constitutional language rights outside the Charter regarding English and French are sustained.
::[[Section Twenty-two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 22:]] existing rights to use languages besides English and French are not affected by the fact that only English and French have language rights in the Charter. (Hence, if there are any rights to use [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] languages anywhere they would continue to exist, though they would have no direct protection under the Charter.)

===Minority language education rights===
::[[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 23:]] rights for certain citizens belonging to French and English speaking minority communities to be educated in their own language.

===Other sections===
Various provisions help to clarify how the Charter works in practice. These include,
::[[Section Twenty-five of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 25:]] states that the Charter does not derogate existing Aboriginal rights and freedoms. Aboriginal rights, including treaty rights, receive more direct constitutional protection under [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|section 35]] of the ''Constitution Act, 1982''.
::[[Section Twenty-six of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 26:]] clarifies that other rights and freedoms in Canada are not invalidated by the Charter.
::[[Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 27:]] requires the Charter to be interpreted in a [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] context.
::[[Section Twenty-eight of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 28:]] states all Charter rights are guaranteed equally to men and women.
::[[Section 29 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 29:]] confirms the rights of [[Education in Canada#Religious schools|religious schools]] are preserved.
::[[Section Thirty of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 30:]] clarifies the applicability of the Charter in the territories.
::[[Section Thirty-one of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 31:]] confirms that the Charter does not extend the powers of legislatures.
Finally, [[Section Thirty-four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 34:]] states that Part I of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', containing the first 34 sections of the Act,  may be collectively referred to as the "Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms".

==History==
[[Image:Every Canadian Needs A Copy.jpg|thumb|250px|Printed copies of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]
Many of the rights and freedoms that are protected under the Charter, including the rights to [[freedom of speech]], [[habeas corpus]] and the [[presumption of innocence]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000622055357/http://canada.justice.gc.ca/en/dept/pub/just/CSJ_page7.html "Sources of Canadian Law"], Department of Justice Canada. Retrieved March 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; have their roots in a set of Canadian laws and legal precedents&lt;ref&gt;The Constitutional Law Group, ''Canadian Constitutional Law'', Third Edition, Toronto: Edmond Montgomery Publications Limited, p. 635.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes known as the [[Implied Bill of Rights]]. Many of these rights were also included in the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]], which the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]] enacted in 1960. However, the Canadian Bill of Rights had a number of shortcomings. Unlike the Charter, it was an ordinary Act of Parliament, which could be amended by a simple majority of Parliament, and it was applicable only to the federal government. The courts also chose to interpret the Bill of Rights conservatively, only on rare occasions applying it to find a contrary law inoperative. The Bill of Rights did not contain all of the rights that are now included in the Charter, omitting, for instance, the [[suffrage|right to vote]]&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. Canada Act 1982 Annotated. Toronto: The Carswell Company Limited, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[freedom of movement]] within Canada.&lt;ref&gt;United States of America v. Cotroni; United States of America v. El Zein [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1469.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centennial of [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1967 aroused greater interest within the government in constitutional reform. Said reforms would include improving safeguards of rights, as well as [[patriation]] of the Constitution, meaning the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] would no longer have to approve [[constitutional amendment]]s. Subsequently, [[Attorney General of Canada|Attorney General]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] appointed law professor [[Barry Strayer]] to research a potential bill of rights. While writing his report, Strayer consulted with a number of notable legal scholars, including [[Walter Tarnopolsky]]. Strayer's report advocated a number of ideas that were later incorporated into the Charter, including protection for language rights. Strayer also advocated excluding economic rights. Finally, he recommended allowing for limits on rights. Such limits are included in the Charter's limitation and notwithstanding clauses.&lt;ref&gt;Strayer, Barry L. [https://web.archive.org/web/20031025061505/http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/dept/pub/jc/vol2/no2/page4.html "My Constitutional Summer of 1967", ''Reflections on the Charter''], Department of Justice Canada. Retrieved March 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Strayer was made the Director of the Constitutional Law Division of the Privy Council Office and in 1974, he became Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice. During those years, Strayer played a role in writing the bill that was ultimately adopted.

Meanwhile, Trudeau, who had become [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] leader and prime minister in 1968, still very much wanted a constitutional bill of rights. The federal government and the [[provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] discussed creating one during negotiations for patriation, which resulted in the [[Victoria Charter]] in 1971. This never came to be implemented. However, Trudeau continued with his efforts to patriate the Constitution, and promised constitutional change during the [[1980 Quebec referendum]]. He would succeed in 1982 with the passage of the ''[[Canada Act 1982]]''. This enacted the ''Constitution Act, 1982''.

The inclusion of a charter of rights in the ''Constitution Act'' was a much-debated issue. Trudeau spoke on television in October 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-73-1092-6040/politics_economy/Patriation/ |title=Charting the Future: Canada's New Constitution &amp;#124; CBC Archives |publisher=Archives.cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announced his intention to constitutionalize a bill of rights that would include fundamental freedoms, democratic guarantees, freedom of movement, legal rights, [[social equality|equality]] and language rights.&lt;ref&gt;Weinrib, Lorraine Eisenstat. "Trudeau and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: A Question of Constitutional Maturation." In ''Trudeau's Shadow: The Life and Legacy of Pierre Elliott Trudeau.'' Edited by Andrew Cohen and JL Granatstein. Vintage Canada, 1998, pages 269.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not want a notwithstanding clause. While his proposal gained popular support,&lt;ref name="Weinrib, 270"&gt;Weinrib, 270.&lt;/ref&gt; provincial leaders opposed the potential limits on their powers. The federal [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] opposition feared liberal bias among judges, should courts be called upon to enforce rights.&lt;ref&gt;Weinrib, 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the British Parliament cited their right to uphold Canada's old form of government.&lt;ref&gt;Weinrib, 272.&lt;/ref&gt; At a suggestion of the Conservatives, Trudeau's government thus agreed to a committee of [[Senate of Canada|Senators]] and MPs to further examine the bill of rights as well as the patriation plan. During this time, 90 hours were spent on the bill of rights alone, all filmed for television,&lt;ref name="Weinrib, 270"/&gt; while civil rights experts and [[advocacy group]]s put forward their perceptions on the Charter's flaws and omissions and how to remedy them.&lt;ref name="Weinrib, 270"/&gt; As Canada had a parliamentary system of government, and as judges were perceived not to have enforced rights well in the past, it was questioned whether the courts should be named as the enforcers of the Charter, as Trudeau wanted. Conservatives argued that elected politicians should be trusted instead. It was eventually decided that the responsibility should go to the courts. At the urging of [[civil libertarian]]s, judges could even now exclude evidence in trials if acquired in breach of Charter rights in certain circumstances, something the Charter was not originally going to provide for. As the process continued, more features were added to the Charter, including equality rights for people with disabilities, more sex equality guarantees and recognition of Canada's [[multiculturalism]]. The limitations clause was also reworded to focus less on the importance of parliamentary government and more on the justifiability of limits in free societies; the latter logic was more in line with rights developments around the world after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Weinrib, pages 271–272.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pierre Elliot Trudeau-2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] was a major advocate of the Charter.]]
In its decision in the ''[[Patriation Reference]]'' (1981), the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] had ruled there was a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that some provincial approval should be sought for constitutional reform. As the provinces still had doubts about the Charter's merits, Trudeau was forced to accept the notwithstanding clause to allow governments to opt out of certain obligations. The notwithstanding clause was accepted as part of a deal called the Kitchen Accord, negotiated by the federal Attorney General [[Jean Chrétien]], Ontario's justice minister [[Roy McMurtry]] and Saskatchewan's justice minister [[Roy Romanow]]. Pressure from provincial governments (which in Canada have jurisdiction over property) and from the country's [[left-wing politics|left wing]], especially the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]], also prevented Trudeau from including any rights protecting private property.&lt;ref&gt;David Johansen, "[http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp268-e.htm PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE CONSTITUTION]," Library of Parliament (Canada), Law and Government Division, October 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Quebec did not support the Charter (or the ''Canada Act 1982''), with "conflicting interpretations" as to why. The opposition could have owed to the ''[[Parti Québécois]]'' leadership being allegedly uncooperative because it was more committed to gaining sovereignty for Quebec. It could have owed to Quebec leaders being excluded from the negotiation of the [[Kitchen Accord]], which they saw as being too centralist. It could have owed to provincial leaders' objections to the Accord's provisions relating to the process of future constitutional amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.cbc.ca/history/?MIval=EpisContent.html&amp;series_id=1&amp;episode_id=17&amp;chapter_id=1&amp;page_id=3&amp;lang=E "The Night of Long Knives"], ''Canada: A People's History.''

Retrieved August 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Charter is still applicable in Quebec because all provinces are bound by the Constitution. However, Quebec's opposition to the 1982 patriation package has led to two failed attempts to amend the Constitution (the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]]) which were designed primarily to obtain Quebec's political approval of the Canadian constitutional order.

While the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was adopted in 1982, it was not until 1985 that the main provisions regarding equality rights (section 15) came into effect. The delay was meant to give the federal and provincial governments an opportunity to review pre-existing statutes and strike potentially unconstitutional inequalities.

The typography of the physical document pictured here, and still distributed today, was typeset by Ottawa's [[David Berman (graphic designer)|David Berman]] intentionally in Carl Dair's [[Cartier (typeface)|Cartier]] typeface: at the time the most prominent Canadian typeface, having been commissioned by the Governor-General as a celebration of Canada's centenary in 1967.

The Charter has been amended since its enactment. Section 25 was amended in 1983 to explicitly recognize more rights regarding [[Aboriginal land claims]], and section 16.1 was added in 1993.  There have also been a number of [[Unsuccessful attempts to amend the Canadian Constitution|unsuccessful attempts to amend the Charter]], including the failed [[Charlottetown Accord]] of 1992. The Charlottetown Accord would have specifically required the Charter to be interpreted in a manner respectful of Quebec's [[distinct society]], and would have added further statements to the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' regarding racial and sexual equality and collective rights, and about [[minority language]] communities. Though the Accord was negotiated among many interest groups, the resulting provisions were so vague that Trudeau, then out of office, feared they would actually conflict with and undermine the Charter's individual rights. He felt judicial review of the rights might be undermined if courts had to favour the policies of provincial governments, as governments would be given responsibility over linguistic minorities. Trudeau thus played a prominent role in leading the popular opposition to the Accord.&lt;ref&gt;Behiels, Michael D. "Who Speaks for Canada? Trudeau and the Constitutional Crisis." In ''Trudeau's Shadow: The Life and Legacy of Pierre Elliott Trudeau'', page 346.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation and enforcement==
The task of interpreting and enforcing the Charter falls to the courts, with the Supreme Court of Canada being the ultimate authority on the matter.

With the Charter's supremacy confirmed by section 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982, the courts continued their practice of striking down unconstitutional statutes or parts of statutes as they had with earlier case law regarding federalism. However, under section 24 of the Charter, courts also gained new powers to enforce creative remedies and exclude more evidence in trials. Courts have since made many important decisions, including ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'' (1988), which struck down [[Abortion in Canada|Canada's abortion law]], and ''[[Vriend v. Alberta]]'' (1998), in which the Supreme Court found the province's exclusion of [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] from protection against discrimination violated the equality rights under section 15. In the latter case, the Court then read the protection into the law.

Courts may receive Charter questions in a number of ways. Rights claimants could be prosecuted under a [[Criminal law in Canada|criminal law]] that they argue is unconstitutional. Others may feel government services and policies are not being dispensed in accordance with the Charter, and apply to lower-level courts for injunctions against the government (as was the case in ''[[Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)]]''). A government may also raise questions of rights by submitting [[reference question]]s to higher-level courts; for example, Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]]'s government approached the Supreme Court with Charter questions as well as federalism concerns in the case ''[[Re Same-Sex Marriage]]'' (2004). Provinces may also do this with their superior courts. The government of [[Prince Edward Island]] initiated the ''[[Provincial Judges Reference]]'' by asking its [[PESCAD|provincial Supreme Court]] a question on [[judicial independence]] under section 11.

[[Image:Ottawa - ON - Oberster Gerichtshof von Kanada.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The building of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], the chief authority on the interpretation of the Charter]]

In several important cases, judges developed various tests and precedents for interpreting specific provisions of the Charter. These include the ''Oakes test'' for section 1, set out in the case ''[[R. v. Oakes]]'' (1986), and the (now defunct&lt;ref&gt;''[[R. v. Kapp]]'', 2008 SCC 41, [2008] 2 SCR 483&lt;/ref&gt;) ''Law test'' for section 15, developed in ''[[Law v. Canada]]'' (1999). Since ''[[Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act]]'' (1985), various approaches to defining and expanding the scope of [[fundamental justice]] (the Canadian name for [[natural justice]] or [[due process]]) under section 7 have been adopted. (''For more information, see the [[:Category:Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|articles on each Charter section]]'').

In general, courts have embraced a ''[[purposive interpretation]]'' of Charter rights.&lt;ref name="Hogg722-725"&gt;Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada'', 2003 Student Ed., pages 722 and 724–725.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that since early cases like ''[[Hunter v. Southam]]'' (1984) and ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart]]'' (1985), they have concentrated not on the traditional, limited understanding of what each right meant when the Charter was adopted in 1982, but rather on changing the scope of rights as appropriate to fit their broader purpose.&lt;ref name="Hogg722-725"/&gt; This is tied to the ''generous interpretation'' of rights, as the purpose of the Charter provisions is assumed to be to increase rights and freedoms of people in a variety of circumstances, at the expense of the government powers.&lt;ref name="Hogg722-725"/&gt; Constitutional scholar [[Peter Hogg]] has approved of the generous approach in some cases, although for others he argues the purpose of the provisions was not to achieve a set of rights as broad as courts have imagined.&lt;ref name="Hogg722-725"/&gt; Indeed, this approach has not been without its critics. Alberta politician [[Ted Morton]] and political scientist [[Rainer Knopff]] have been very critical of this phenomenon. Although they feel the basis for the approach, the [[living tree doctrine]] (the classical name for generous interpretations of the Canadian Constitution), is sound, they argue Charter case law has been more radical. When the living tree doctrine is applied right, the authors claim, "The elm remained an elm; it grew new branches but did not transform itself into an oak or a willow." The doctrine can be used, for example, so a right is upheld even when a government threatens to violate it with new technology, as long as the essential right remains the same; but the authors claim that the courts have used the doctrine to "create new rights." As an example, the authors note that the Charter right against [[self-incrimination]] has been extended to cover scenarios in the justice system that had previously been unregulated by self-incrimination rights in other Canadian laws.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, F.L. and Rainer Knopff. ''The Charter Revolution &amp; the Court Party.'' Toronto: Broadview Press, 2000, pages 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another general approach to interpreting Charter rights is to consider international legal precedents with countries that have specific rights protections, such as the [[United States Bill of Rights]] (an influence on aspects of the Charter) and the [[Constitution of South Africa]]. However, international precedent is only of guiding value and is not binding. For example, the Supreme Court has referred to the Charter and the American Bill of Rights as being "born to different countries in different ages and in different circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed., pages 732; the case quoted was ''[[R. v. Rahey]]'' (1987) by [[Gérard La Forest]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocacy groups frequently [[intervention (law)|intervene]] in cases to make arguments on how to interpret the Charter. Some examples are the [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association]], [[Canadian Civil Liberties Association]], the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]], the [[Canadian Labour Congress]], the [[Women's Legal Education and Action Fund]] (LEAF), and [[REAL Women of Canada]]. The purpose of such interventions is to assist the court and to attempt to influence the court to render a decision favourable to the legal interests of the group.

A further approach to the Charter, taken by the courts, is the [[dialogue principle]], which involves greater participation by elected governments. This approach involves governments drafting legislation in response to court rulings and courts acknowledging the effort if the new legislation is challenged.

==Comparisons with other human rights documents==
[[Image:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|right|thumb|The [[United States Bill of Rights]] influenced the text of the Charter, but its rights provisions are interpreted more conservatively. Canadian civil-rights and constitutional cases as compared to American cases occasionally have dissimilar outcomes because the broader Charter rights are limited by the "savings clause" of [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1 of the Charter]] as interpreted in ''[[R. v. Oakes]]'']]
Some Canadian [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] saw the movement to entrench a charter as contrary to the British model of [[Parliamentary supremacy]]. Others would say that the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) has now limited British parliamentary power to a greater degree than the Canadian Charter limited the power of the Canadian Parliament and provincial legislatures. Hogg has speculated that the British adopted the ''[[Human Rights Act 1998]]'', which allows the [[ECHR]] to be enforced directly in domestic courts, partly because they were inspired by the similar Canadian Charter.&lt;ref name="saunders"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/features/constitution/ |title=The Charter at 20 |last=Saunders |first=Philip |publisher=CBC News Online |date=April 2002 |accessdate=March 17, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307194214/http://www.cbc.ca/news/features/constitution/ |archivedate= 7 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Charter bears a number of similarities to the European Convention, specifically in relation to the limitations clauses contained in the European document.&lt;ref name="Brice Dickson 1999"&gt;Brice Dickson, "Human Rights in the 21st Century," ''Amnesty International Lecture, Queen's University, Belfast'', 11 November 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this similarity with European human rights law, the Supreme Court of Canada turns not only to the [[Constitution of the United States]] case law in interpreting the Charter, but also to [[European Court of Human Rights]] cases.

The core distinction between the United States Bill of Rights and Canadian Charter is the existence of the limitations and notwithstanding clauses. Canadian courts have consequently interpreted each right more expansively.&lt;ref name="Hogg732"&gt;Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada.'' 2003 Student Ed., pages 732–733.&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the limitations clause, where a violation of a right exists, the law will not necessarily grant protection of that right.&lt;ref name="Hogg732"/&gt; In contrast, rights under the US Bill of Rights are absolute and so a violation will not be found until there has been sufficient encroachment on those rights. The sum effect is that both constitutions provide comparable protection of many rights.&lt;ref name="Hogg732"/&gt; Fundamental justice (in section 7 of the Canadian Charter) is therefore interpreted to include more legal protections than due process, which is its US equivalent. Freedom of expression in section 2 also has a more wide-ranging scope than the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]'s freedom of speech.&lt;ref name="Hogg732"/&gt; In ''[[RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd.]]'' (1986), the Canadian Supreme Court considered [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] of the kind the US First Amendment did not permit, as it was disruptive conduct (though there was some speech involved that the First Amendment might otherwise protect). The Supreme Court, however, ruled the picketing, including the disruptive conduct, were fully protected under section 2 of the Charter. The Court then relied on section 1 to find the injunction against the picketing was just.&lt;ref&gt;Manfredi, Christopher P. "The Canadian Supreme Court and American Judicial Review: United States Constitutional Jurisprudence and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms." ''The American Journal of Comparative Law'', vol. 40, no. 1. (Winter, 1992), pages 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The limitations clause has also allowed governments to enact laws that would be considered unconstitutional in the US. The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld some of Quebec's limits on the use of [[English language|English]] on signs and has upheld [[publication ban]]s that prohibit media from mentioning the names of juvenile criminals.

Section 28 of the Charter performs a function similar to that of the unratified [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in the US. While that proposed amendment had many critics, there was no comparable opposition to the Charter's section 28.&lt;ref&gt;Women's International Network News, "Women on the Move in Canada." Summer 1993, Vol. 19 Issue 3, page 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Canadian feminists had to stage large protests to demonstrate support for the inclusion of the section which had not been part of the original draft of the charter.&lt;ref name="lugtig"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doris Anderson, "Canadian Women and the Charter of Rights" (2005) 19 Nat'l J Const L 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] has several parallels with the Canadian Charter, but in some cases the Covenant goes further with regard to rights in its text. For example, a right to [[legal aid]] has been read into section 10 of the Charter (the right to counsel), but the Covenant explicitly guarantees the accused need not pay "if he does not have sufficient means."&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada.'' 2003 Student Ed., pages 733–734.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Charter has little to say, explicitly at least, about economic and social rights. On this point, it stands in marked contrast with the [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]] and with the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]. There are some who feel economic rights ought to be read into section 7 rights to [[security of the person]] and section 15 equality rights to make the Charter similar to the Covenant.&lt;ref name="lugtig"&gt;Lugtig, Sarah and Debra Parkes, "Where do we go from here?" ''Herizons'', Spring 2002, Vol. 15 Issue 4, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale is that economic rights can relate to a decent [[standard of living]] and can help the civil rights flourish in a livable environment.&lt;ref name="lugtig"/&gt; Canadian courts, however, have been hesitant in this area, stating that economic rights are [[political question]]s and adding that as [[negative and positive rights|positive rights]], economic rights are of questionable legitimacy.&lt;ref name="lugtig"/&gt;

The Charter itself influenced the [[Constitution of South Africa Chapter 2: Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in the Constitution of South Africa.&lt;ref name="lugtig"/&gt; The limitations clause under section 36 of the South African law has been compared to section 1 of that ''Charter''.&lt;ref name="Brice Dickson 1999"/&gt;

[[Jamaica]]'s Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms was also influenced, in part, by the Canadian charter.&lt;ref&gt;http://jis.gov.jm/media/charter-of-rights1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20110417/cleisure/cleisure2.html|title=Rights and responsibilities under the charter|author=|date=|website=jamaica-gleaner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Charter and national values==
[[Image:March of Hearts crowd on Parliament Hill 2004.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The "March of Hearts" rally for [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] equality under the Charter in 2004.]]
The Charter was intended to be a source for [[Canadian values]] and national unity. As Professor [[Alan Cairns]] noted, "The initial federal government premise was on developing a pan-Canadian identity."&lt;ref name="saunders"/&gt; Trudeau himself later wrote in his ''Memoirs'' that "Canada itself" could now be defined as a "society where all people are equal and where they share some fundamental values based upon freedom", and that all Canadians could identify with the values of liberty and equality.&lt;ref&gt;Trudeau, Pierre Elliott. ''Memoirs'', Toronto: McClelland &amp; Stewart, 1993, pages 322–323.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter's unifying purpose was particularly important to the mobility and language rights. According to author [[Rand Dyck]], some scholars believe section 23, with its minority language education rights, "was the only part of the Charter with which Pierre Trudeau was truly concerned".&lt;ref&gt;Dyck, Rand. ''Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches.'' Third ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson Thomson Learning, 2000, page 442.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the mobility and language rights, [[French Canadian]]s, who have been at the centre of unity debates, are able to travel throughout all Canada and receive government and educational services in their own language. Hence, they are not confined to Quebec (the only province where they form the majority and where most of their population is based), which would polarize the country along regional lines. The Charter was also supposed to standardize previously diverse laws throughout the country and gear them towards a single principle of liberty.&lt;ref name="hogg704"&gt;Hogg, ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed., pages 704–705.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[premier of Ontario]] [[Bob Rae]] has stated that the Charter "functions as a symbol for all Canadians" in practice because it represents the core value of freedom.&lt;ref name="saunders"/&gt; Academic [[Peter H. Russell|Peter Russell]] has been more skeptical of the Charter's value in this field. Cairns, who feels the Charter is the most important constitutional document to many Canadians, and that the Charter was meant to shape the Canadian identity, has also expressed concern that groups within society see certain provisions as belonging to them alone rather than to all Canadians.&lt;ref name="saunders"/&gt; It has also been noted that issues like [[abortion]] and [[pornography]], raised by the Charter, tend to be controversial.&lt;ref name="hogg704"/&gt; Still, [[opinion polls]] in 2002 showed Canadians felt the Charter significantly represented Canada, although many were unaware of the document's actual contents.&lt;ref&gt;Byfield, Joanne. "The right to be ignorant." ''Report/Newsmagazine'' (National Edition); December 16, 2002, Vol. 29, Issue 24, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only values mentioned by the [[Preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter's preamble]] are recognition for the supremacy of [[Constitutional references to God|God]] and the [[rule of law]], but these have been controversial and of minor legal consequence. In 1999, MP [[Svend Robinson]] brought forward a failed proposal before the [[House of Commons of Canada]] that would have amended the Charter by removing the mention of God, as he felt it did not reflect Canada's diversity.

Section 27 also recognizes a value of multiculturalism. In 2002, polls found 86% of Canadians approved of this section.&lt;ref&gt;Tracey Tyler, "Support for Charter runs strong: Survey; Approval highest in Quebec on 20-year-old rights law", ''Toronto Star'', Apr 12, 2002, p. A07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
While the Charter has enjoyed a great deal of popularity, with 82% of Canadians describing it as a good thing in opinion polls in 1987 and 1999,&lt;ref name="saunders"/&gt; the document has also been subject to published criticisms from both sides of the political spectrum. One left-wing critic is Professor [[Michael Mandel (law professor)|Michael Mandel]], who wrote that in comparison to politicians, judges do not have to be as sensitive to the will of the electorate, nor do they have to make sure their decisions are easily understandable to the average Canadian citizen. This, in Mandel's view, limits democracy.&lt;ref name="Dyck446"&gt;Dyck, page 446, summarizing Mandel, Michael, ''The Charter of Rights and the Legalization of Politics in Canada'' (Toronto: Wall and Thompson, 1989; revised edition, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Mandel has also asserted that the Charter makes Canada more like the United States, especially by serving corporate rights and [[individual rights]] rather than group rights and social rights.&lt;ref name="Dyck446"/&gt; He has argued that there are several things that should be included in the Charter, such as a right to health care and a basic right to free education. Hence, the perceived [[Americanization]] of Canadian politics is seen as coming at the expense of values more important for Canadians.&lt;ref name="Dyck446"/&gt; The labour movement has been disappointed in the reluctance of the courts to use the Charter to support various forms of union activity, such as the "right to strike".

Conservative critics Morton and Knopff have raised several concerns about the Charter, notably by alleging that the federal government has used it to limit provincial powers by allying with various rights claimants and interest groups. In their book ''The Charter Revolution &amp; the Court Party'', Morton and Knopff express their suspicions of this alliance in detail, accusing the Trudeau and Chrétien governments of funding litigious groups. For example, these governments used the [[Court Challenges Program of Canada|Court Challenges Program]] to support minority language educational rights claims. Morton and Knopff also assert that [[crown attorney|crown counsel]] has intentionally lost cases in which the government was taken to court for allegedly violating rights, particularly [[gay rights]] and [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Morton and Knopff, 95. They complain about crown counsels on page 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist Rand Dyck, in observing these criticisms, notes that while judges have had their scope of review widened, they have still upheld most laws challenged on Charter grounds. With regard to litigious interest groups, Dyck points out that "the record is not as clear as Morton and Knopff imply. All such groups have experienced wins and losses."&lt;ref&gt;Dyck, page 448.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]] has criticized the Charter for contributing to the fragmentation of the country, at both the individual and group levels. In encouraging discourse based upon rights, the Charter is said to inject an adversarial spirit into Canadian politics, making it difficult to realize the common good. Blattberg also claims that the Charter undercuts the Canadian political community since it is ultimately a cosmopolitan document. Finally, he argues that people would be more motivated to uphold individual liberties if they were expressed with terms that are much "thicker" (less abstract) than rights.&lt;ref&gt;Blattberg, Charles. ''Shall We Dance? A Patriotic Politics for Canada''. Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2003, especially pages 83–94&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5603">The '''[[MIT]] Center for Civic Media''' (formerly the '''Center for Future Civic Media''') is a research and practical center that develops and implements tools that support political action and "the information needs of [civic] communities".&lt;ref&gt;From http://civic.mit.edu/about, retrieved June 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission reads in part:

:The MIT Center for Civic Media creates and deploys technical and social tools that fill the information needs of communities.

:We are inventors of new technologies that support and foster [[civic media]]&lt;ref&gt;According to the center's website: "Civic media is any form of communication that strengthens the social bonds within a community or creates a strong sense of [[civic engagement]] among its residents." [http://civic.mit.edu/about CCM homepage]. Retrieved 2011-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; and political action; we are a hub for the study of these technologies; and we coordinate community-based test beds both in the United States and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;From http://civic.mit.edu/about, retrieved June 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Center for Civic Media was founded in 2007 as a joint effort of the [[MIT Media Lab]] and the MIT Comparative Media Studies program. Its initial funding, a four-year grant from the [[Knight Foundation]], was won in a contest "to foster blogs and other digital efforts that seek to bring together residents of a city or town in ways that local newspapers historically have done." The founders planned to "develop new technologies and practices to help newspapers attract readers as a greater number of Americans use the Internet as their primary news source."&lt;ref&gt;"Knight Foundation Awards $12-Million for Digital News Projects." Chronicle of Philanthropy, 31 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See the original [http://civic.mit.edu/sites/civic.mit.edu/files/C4-Knight-foundation-proposal.pdf proposal], hosted at civic.mit.edu.  Retrieved June 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It expanded in 2011.

Staffed by academic, technical, and professional staff, the Center was originally led by [[Christopher Csikszentmihályi]], along with the Media Lab's [[Mitchel Resnick]] and Comparative Media Studies' [[Henry Jenkins]]. [[Ethan Zuckerman]] was announced as the Center's new director in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/zuckerman-civic-media.html MIT News Office report] on the center and its annual [[Civic Media Conference]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Others affiliated with the center include [[Sasha Costanza-Chock]], [[Benjamin Mako Hill]], [[William Uricchio]], [[Jing Wang (professor)|Jing Wang]], and [[Jeffrey Warren]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://civic.mit.edu/team Center for Civic Media team]. Retrieved 2011-10-07&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and development ==
[[File:Port Sulphur, Wilkinson Bay, East.jpg|thumb|An example of Grassroots Mapping's balloon-and-camera imagery, taken in the Gulf of Mexico immediately after the B.P. Oil Spill.]] The Center creates tools for deployment and testing in geographic communities. Like the Media Lab, the work is iterative, experimental, and draws in large part on the work of current graduate students. But unlike much other work at the Media Lab, Center tools are expected to have immediate applications, even if narrowly focused on a specific community's need.

With varying levels of adoption, deployed civic media tools and communities have included:
* [http://grassrootsmapping.org Grassroots Mapping] (Gulf of Mexico oil spill; the Gowanus Canal, Brooklyn, Superfund site), a collection of cartographic tools and practices—such as best practices for using balloons, kites, inexpensive cameras, and open-source software—for citizens to produce their own aerial imagery. Grassroots Mapping grew into the larger [http://publiclaboratory.org Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science], which won a [http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/20110151/ $500,000 Knight News Challenge grant] for its work.

'''Comat''' is an [[India]]n [[social enterprise]] specializing in the delivery of information based services to rural citizens in India. It was founded in 1996 and currently has over 800 rural centers from which it serves over 75,000 citizens each day. In June 2011, Comat was acquired by Glodyn Technoserve, an IT services company headquartered in Mumbai, India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-06-10/news/29643074_1_e-governance-biz-e-governance-projects-comat-technologies]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's prior investors included [[Omidyar Network]], Avigo Capital and Elevar Equity.

==Services==
Comat has been involved in several projects that have eased people's access to essential information based services, especially in the State of [[Karnataka]]. The Company provides Government, Education and Financial Services to rural citizens through 800 [[telecentres]] set up as part of the Nemmadi project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nemmadi.karnataka.gov.in/ Nemmadi Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219061352/http://nemmadi.karnataka.gov.in/ |date=December 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comat has also been involved in the digitization of over 20 million land records ([[Bhoomi (software)]]), that has benefited over 6.7 million farmers in the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://connection.aed.org/main.htm |title=Making the Connection |edition=first|date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In partnership with the department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, Comat has created a biometric database of over 45 million citizens living in Karnataka. This is the largest electronic citizen database in India and can act as the stepping stone for the [[Unique Identification Authority of India|Unique Identification Number]]. Comat has begun the Proof of Concept for the Unique Identification Number in two districts of Karnataka.

[[File:Cordobazo.jpg|thumb|300px|''Cordobazo'' uprising]]
The '''Cordobazo''' was a [[civil uprising]] in the city of [[Córdoba, Argentina]], at the end of May 1969, during the military dictatorship of General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]], which occurred a few days after the ''[[Rosariazo]]'', and a year after the French [[May '68]]. Contrary to previous protests, the Cordobazo did not correspond to previous struggles, headed by [[Marxist]] workers' leaders, but associated students and workers in the same struggle against the [[Argentine Revolution|military government]].&lt;ref name=Bermand&gt;Carmen Bernand, « D’une rive à l’autre », ''[[Nuevo Mundo Mundos Nuevos]], Materiales de seminarios'', 2008 (Latin-Americanist Review published by the [[EHESS]]), Put on line on 15 June 2008. URL : http://nuevomundo.revues.org//index35983.html Accessed on 28 July 2008. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 1969 there was a [[general strike]] in Córdoba, which brought police repression and a civil uprising, an episode later termed the Cordobazo. The next day the [[CGT de los Argentinos]], headed in Cordoba by [[Agustín Tosco]], called for national strike.

== Context ==

General Onganía had taken power during the 1966 coup, self-named ''[[Revolución Argentina]]'' (Argentine Revolution), which had toppled President [[Arturo Illia]] ([[Radical Civic Union]], UCR). Onganía's regime immediately suspended the [[right to strike]], froze workers' wages, deactivated the Commission on Minimum Wages, while his [[Minister of Economy (Argentina)|Minister of Economy]], [[Adalbert Krieger Vasena]], decreed a 40% devaluation of the [[Argentine peso|peso]]. The age of retirement was also extended.

Onganía had also implemented the "law on repression of [[Communism]]" and had ordered the ''[[Dirección de Investigación de Políticas Antidemocráticas]]'' (DIPA) political police to detain political activists and trade-unionists who did not care to cooperate with him in the "participationist" policies, and, considering universities as "centers of subversion and communism", had also reneged on the [[1918 University Reform]] (which had found its origins in students' protests in Córdoba), violently expelling from universities teachers and students in the ''[[Noche de los Bastones Largos]]''.

Furthermore, Onganía was attempting to impose [[corporatism]] in Argentina. In this context, the important industrial hub of Córdoba was one of the experimental place of corporatinist policies, implemented by the appointed governor [[Carlos José Caballero|Carlos Caballero]].

== Popular uprising ==
[[File:Cordobazo3.jpg|thumb|29 May 1969]]
These unpopular measures led to increasing strikes and protests in the country. At the beginning of May '69, a succession of strikes and popular assemblies occurred in Córdoba, which were harshly repressed by the provincial and national military authorities of the ''junta''. 

On 13 May 1969, in [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]], former workers of a sugar mill took the factory and its manager as hostage, asking for overdue payments. 

On 14 May, in Córdoba, automobile industry workers protested the elimination of the Saturday rest. 

On 15 May, the University of [[Corrientes]] increased the price of food tickets in its cafeteria fivefold, and the ensuing protest ended up with one student, Juan José Cabral, killed by the police (see ''[[Correntinazo]]'').

On 17 May, the student Adolfo Bello was killed during a protest in Rosario (see ''[[Rosariazo]]'').

On 21 May, the police killed the 15-year-old student Luis Blanco during a silent march of 4,000 persons in Rosario, in commemoration of Bello's death. Rosario is declared by the authorities an emergency zone under military jurisdiction.
 
On 29 May 1969, the police shot dead the first victim of the Cordobazo, Máximo Mena, which triggered further demonstrations and rioting. Progressively, the population took control of most of the city, setting up barricades to defend themselves. They burnt several administrative centers, as well as the headquarters of the foreign firms, which symbolized Vasena's economic policies, of [[Citroën]] and [[Xerox]], although they then accompanied the firefighters in order to impede the fire from extending itself to other city blocks.

On the night of 29 to 30 May 1969, Onganía decided to send the [[Argentine Armed Forces|military]] to crush the uprising. Meanwhile, the headquarters of the ''[[CGT de los Argentinos]]'' (CGTA, an offshoot of the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Confederation of Labour]] created in 1968 over opposition to the collaborationist stance adopted by the general secretary of the CGT, [[Augusto Vandor]]) were searched and its leaders arrested. Thus, [[Agustín Tosco]], one of the main leader of the CGTA, was arrested and condemned by the War Council.

On the following days, official medias reflected the official vision of the events, allegedly a conspiracy of international communism.

== Consequences ==
[[File:ATosco.jpg|thumb|Union leader [[Agustín Tosco]]]]
The Cordobazo immediately influenced events in other parts of the country, where violent demonstrations also occurred, and favorised the influence of trade unionists radically opposed to the dictatorship. This latter current, known as ''sindicalismo clasista'', came to head the [[SMATA]] trade union of 
Córdoba, as well as the autonomous unions of Fiat Concord and Fiat [[Materfer]] ([[SITRAC-SITRAM]]). Workers' leaders of Córdoba, such as  
[[Agustín Tosco]], [[René Salamanca]], [[Gregorio Flores]] and [[José Francisco Páez]], played a role on the national political stage. In [[Salta]], [[Armando Jaime]] also headed the ''CGT clasista''.

It also underlined two new facts in Argentine politics: on one hand, the alliance of the [[students' movement]] with the workers, and on the other hand, the predominance of the interior (or of the [[provinces of Argentina]]) on the capital, [[Buenos Aires]].

The Cordobazo also had lasting influences on the [[history of Argentina]]. On one hand, it showed that the population accepted violent means to defend themselves against the military dictatorship, since no other democratic means of expression could be used. On the other hand, [[liberal democracy]], [[parliamentarism]] and the system of elections was globally refused by what came to be known as the ''New Opposition'' (''Nueva Oposición''). Even [[Arturo Frondizi]], who had been elected in 1958, had legitimized the 1955 military coup, known as the ''[[Revolución Libertadora]]'', which had toppled [[Juan Perón]].

Henceforth, the Cordobazo showed, to contemporary activists, that they could find popular support for violent and revolutionary means of actions against Onganía's dictatorship, thus radicalizing the social and political context of Argentina. Several armed groups were formed or strengthened in the aftermaths of the Cordobazo, among them the ''[[Fuerzas Armadas Peronistas]]'' (FAP, 1967), the ''[[Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación]]'' (FAL, 1968), the ''[[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo]]'' (ERP), the [[Peronism|Revolutionary Peronists]] [[Montoneros]], and the ''[[Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (Argentina)|Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias]]''.

Finally, the Cordobazo showed Onganía's weakness. He forced his Minister of Economy Vasena to resign, while a transition period opened itself, the military junta, supreme organ of the so-called ''Revolución Argentina'', deciding to depose Onganía of his leadership, replaced in June 1970 by General [[Roberto M. Levingston]], former military attaché at the Argentine Embassy in [[Washington D.C.]]. Instead of calling for elections, Levingston decided to go ahead with the ''Revolución Argentina'', governing against the will of the different political parties.

The latter countered Levingston's policies by the conjoint declaration of 11 November 1970, named ''la [[Hora del Pueblo]]'' (The Hour of the People), which called for free and immediate democratic elections to put an end to the political crisis. The declaration was signed by the [[Radical Civic Union]] (UCR), the [[Justicialist Party]] (Peronist Party), the [[Argentine Socialist Party]] (PSA), the [[Popular Conservative Party (Argentina)|Popular Conservative Party]] (PCP) and the ''[[Partido Bloquista]]'' (PB).

The Opposition's call for elections led to Levingston's replacement by General [[Alejandro Lanusse]], who called for elections but excluded the Peronist Party from participating to it. Lanusse tried to implement starting in July 1971 the ''[[Gran Acuerdo Nacional]]'' (Great National Agreement), which was to find an honorable exit for the military junta without allowing Peronism participation to the elections. The proposal was rejected by Perón, exiled in Spain, who formed the [[FRECILINA]] (''Frente Cívico de Liberación Nacional'', Civic Front of National Liberation), headed by his delegate [[Héctor José Cámpora]] and which gathered the Justicialist Party and the ''[[Movimiento de Integración y Desarrollo]]'' (MID), headed by [[Arturo Frondizi]]. The FRECILINA requested free and unrestricted elections, which took place on March 11, 1973.

[[File:Coro Graphic.jpg|thumb|right]]

'''Coro''' is an [[United States|American]] [[non-partisan]], [[non-profit organization]] best known for its fellowship program dedicated to teaching skills useful in leadership in [[Public administration|public affairs]] to young adults.

The organization was founded in [[San Francisco]] in 1942 by W. Donald Fletcher, an attorney, and Van Duyn Dodge, an investment counselor. Their premise was based on the realization that, unlike law, business or medicine, post graduate training in the area of leadership was non existent, and they wanted to train young veterans in the leadership skills necessary to assure that our democratic system of government could more effectively meet the needs of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Organization-CORO | url=http://www.coro.org/site/c.geJNIUOzErH/b.2141879/k.ADD0/The_Organization.htm | accessdate=2007-05-27 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522011156/http://www.coro.org/site/c.geJNIUOzErH/b.2141879/k.ADD0/The_Organization.htm | archivedate=2007-05-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the assumption that "Coro" refers to the word "core," the name is a [[nonce word]] created to represent "both discovery and exploration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Name &amp; Logo-CORO | url=http://www.coro.org/site/c.geJNIUOzErH/b.2141893/k.1DD7/Name__Logo.htm | accessdate=2007-05-27 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429025458/http://www.coro.org/site/c.geJNIUOzErH/b.2141893/k.1DD7/Name__Logo.htm | archivedate=2007-04-29 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coro Fellows Program in Public Affairs ==

The Coro Fellows Program in Public Affairs, the organization's premier fellowship, is a full-time, nine month, graduate-level experiential leadership training program that prepares diverse, talented and committed individuals for effective and ethical leadership in the public affairs arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coro.org/site/c.geJNIUOzErH/b.4667963/k.725D/Coro_Fellows_Program.htm |title=Coro Fellows Program-CORO |publisher=Coro.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012183023/http://www.coro.org/site/c.geJNIUOzErH/b.4667963/k.725D/Coro_Fellows_Program.htm |archivedate=2011-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconventional by traditional academic standards, the Fellows Program is rigorous and demanding, aiming toward personal and professional growth. The Fellows Program is offered in [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[San Francisco]] and [[St. Louis]].
Coro introduces program participants to all aspects of the public affairs arena, preparing them to translate their ideals into action for improving their own communities and beyond. The fellowship comprises field placements, group interviews, seminars, focus weeks, and individual and group projects.

Sixty Fellows are chosen nationally each year through a highly competitive selection process, including a day-long assessment at each center’s city. The Fellows represent a broad range of academic, work, cultural, racial and economic backgrounds, ages and interests. What they share is an unwavering commitment to civic engagement. Recent participants have ranged from 21 to 53 years of age.

== Coro Exploring Leadership Program ==

The Coro Exploring Leadership Program is offered in multiple cities, including [[Oakland]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coro.org/site/c.ksKWL6PMLtF/b.4700239/k.43A0/The_Exploring_Leadership_Program.htm |title=The Exploring Leadership Program-San Francisco |publisher=Coro.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927022529/http://www.coro.org/site/c.ksKWL6PMLtF/b.4700239/k.43A0/The_Exploring_Leadership_Program.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched in 1998, Exploring Leadership (EL) is a full-time summer and part-time academic year program that prepares high school juniors for opportunities in the 21st century workforce and higher education by engaging them to become active citizens and to improve their communities.

== Community &amp; Regional Programs ==
Each Coro location has developed a variety of full and part-time, community and regionally based programs aimed at leadership training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coro.org/site/c.geJNIUOzErH/b.2118257/k.B9CB/Community__Regional_Programs.htm |title=Community &amp; Regional Programs-CORO |publisher=Coro.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020213313/http://www.coro.org/site/c.geJNIUOzErH/b.2118257/k.B9CB/Community__Regional_Programs.htm |archivedate=2011-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cleveland Executive Fellowship''' - A Coro Program funded by the Cleveland Foundation is a full-time one-year, immersion fellowship to  develop individuals who can serve as Northeast Ohio's future leaders. Coro National and the Cleveland Foundation launched the fellowship with the ultimate goal of creating a pipeline of civic leaders who can problem solve across traditional boundaries, work with diverse communities and make the civic arena work through networks and collaboration.

'''Leadership New York''' at the Coro New York Leadership Center and '''Leadership Southern California''' at Coro Southern California are executive-level programs conducted in partnership with local organizations in each city. These mid-career professionals come together to examine and address the most pressing regional issues in their communities.

'''Coro Southern California’s Health Leadership Program “HLP”''' is a premier leadership training experience that uses collaborative approaches to prepare a multi-cultural, professionally diverse group of professionals dedicated to improving the quality and accessibility of healthcare in Los Angeles County.

Coro Center for Civic Leadership’s '''Regional Internship Center''' strives to increase the number of organizations in Southwestern Pennsylvania offering internships by actively working with employers to develop programs and connect them with potential interns.

== Locations ==

In addition to San Francisco, centers under the Coro umbrella exist in [[Los Angeles]] (1957), [[St. Louis]] (1972), [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (1975), [[New York City|New York]] (1980), and [[Pittsburgh]] (1999). In 2005, Coro partnered with the [[Cleveland Foundation]] to establish a new Executive Fellows program in [[Cleveland]]. Although each location is independently-run, they are connected by Coro National, a [[501(c)(3)]] governing body.  The Coro National Alumni Association is also a freestanding non-profit (incorporated 1990) that supports nearly 10,000 alumni worldwide.

==Notable alumni==

Approximately 1,000-1,200 people participate in Coro's various programs each year, many of whom work in non-profit organizations, businesses, and government agencies. Some notable alumni who currently hold or have held public office include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Notable Alumni-CORO | url=http://www.coro.org/site/c.geJNIUOzErH/b.2141891/k.9E47/Notable_Alumni.htm | accessdate=2012-11-05 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219001626/http://www.coro.org/site/c.geJNIUOzErH/b.2141891/k.9E47/Notable_Alumni.htm | archivedate=2011-02-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural liberalism''' is a [[liberalism|liberal]] view of society that stresses the freedom of individuals from [[cultural norm]]s and in the words of [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]] is often expressed as the right to "march to the beat of a different drummer".&lt;ref&gt;Henry David Thoreau, ''Walden'', Conclusion, 1854.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural liberals believe that society should not impose any specific code of behavior and they see themselves as defending the moral rights of [[nonconformist]]s to express their own identity however they see fit, as long as they [[Harm principle|do not harm anyone]].{{Dubious|date=June 2012}} The [[culture wars]] in politics are generally disagreements between cultural liberals and [[Cultural conservatism|cultural conservatives]], as cultural liberals are strongly opposed to censorship or any kind of oversight of spoken or written material.&lt;ref&gt;"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers." [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ The Universal Declaration of Human Rights]. Retrieved 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that the structure of one's [[family]] and the nature of [[marriage]] should be left up to individual decision and they argue that as long as one does no harm no lifestyle is inherently better than any other. Because cultural liberalism expresses the social dimension of [[liberalism]], it is often referred to as "social liberalism", but is not the same as the political ideology known as [[social liberalism]].

Only in the post Soviet era, independent Ukraine has officially condemned the Holodomor as an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people. The causes, nature, and extent of the Holodomor remain topics of controversy and active scholarship, including the [[Holodomor genocide question|debate over whether or not it constitutes genocide]].

==Soviet Union==

=== Cover-up of the famine ===

The Soviet leadership undertook extensive efforts to prevent the spread of any information about the famine by keeping state communications [[top secret]] and taking other measures to prevent word of the famine from spreading. When Ukrainian peasants traveled north to Russia seeking bread, [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] sent a secret telegram to the party and provincial police chiefs with instructions to turn them back,&lt;ref name="ConquestDoE"&gt;[[Robert Conquest]] ''The Dragons of Expectation. Reality and Delusion in the Course of History'', W.W. Norton and Company (2004), {{ISBN|0-393-05933-2}}, page 102.&lt;/ref&gt; alleging [[Poland|Polish]] agents were attempting to create a famine scare. [[State Political Directorate|OGPU]] chairman [[Genrikh Yagoda]] subsequently reported that over 200,000 peasants had been turned back.

Stalin's wife, [[Nadezhda Allilueva]], learned about the famine from Ukrainian students at the technical school she was attending. Allilueva complained to Stalin, who then ordered the OGPU to purge all the college students who had taken part in [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivization]].&lt;ref&gt;(Harvest of Sorrow, page 325)&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet head-of-state [[Mikhail Kalinin]] responded to Western offers of food by telling of "political cheats who offer to help the starving Ukraine," and commented, "Only the most decadent classes are capable of producing such cynical elements."&lt;ref name="reflections" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert|last=Conquest|author-link=Robert Conquest|url=http://www.hoover.org/research/how-liberals-funked-it|title=How Liberals Funked It|journal=Hoover Digest|issue=3|date=30 July 1999|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Gareth Jones (journalist)|Gareth Jones]] in March 1933, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] stated, "Well, there is no famine", and went on to say, "You must take a longer view. The present hunger is temporary. In writing books you must have a longer view. It would be difficult to describe it as hunger."&lt;ref name="Jones-Litvinov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Gareth|authorlink=Gareth Jones (journalist)|url=http://www.garethjones.org/published_articles/st_patricks/litvinov_famine_denia-oldlxxxx.htm|title=Gareth Jones Interview with Commissar Maxim Litvinov March 1933|publisher=garethjones.org|date=March 1933|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On instructions from Litvinov, Boris Skvirsky, embassy counselor of the recently opened Soviet Embassy in the United States, published a letter on January 3, 1934, in response to a pamphlet about the famine.&lt;ref name="Carynnyk"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Marco|last=Carynnyk|url=http://ukrweekly.com/Archive/1983/398325.shtml|title=The New York Times and the Great Famine, Part III|journal=The Ukrainian Weekly|date=25 September 1983|volume=LI|issue=39|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050829073245/http://ukrweekly.com/Archive/1983/398325.shtml|archivedate=29 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter, Skvirsky stated that the idea that the Soviet government was "deliberately killing the population of the Ukraine" "wholly grotesque." He claimed that the Ukrainian population had been increasing at an annual rate of 2 percent during the preceding five years and asserted that the death rate in Ukraine "was the lowest of that of any of the constituent republics composing the Soviet Union", concluding that it "was about 35 percent lower than the pre-war death rate of [[Russian Empire|tsarist]] days."&lt;ref name="Mace"&gt;New York Times, as quoted in James E. Mace, [http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1988/028822.shtml "Collaboration in the suppression of the Ukrainian famine"] (paper delivered at a conference on "Recognition and Denial of Genocide and Mass Killing in the 20th Century", held in New York City on November 13, 1987), ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'', January 10, 1988, No. 2, Vol. LVI&lt;/ref&gt;

Mention of the famine was criminalized, punishable with a five-year term in the [[Gulag]] [[labor camp]]s. Blaming the authorities was punishable by death.&lt;ref name="reflections"&gt;[[Robert Conquest]] ''Reflections on a Ravaged Century'' (2000) {{ISBN|0-393-04818-7}}, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Falsification and suppression of evidence ===

The true number of dead was concealed. At the Kiev Medical Inspectorate, for example, the actual number of corpses, 9,472, was recorded as only 3,997. The GPU was directly involved in the deliberate destruction of actual birth and death records, as well as the fabrication of false information to cover up information regarding the causes and scale of death in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Boriak, Hennadii (Fall 2001). "The publication of sources on the history of the 1932-1933 famine-genocide: history, current state, and prospects". ''Harvard Ukrainian Studies'' '''25''' (3-4): 167–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar falsifications of official records were widespread.&lt;ref name="reflections" /&gt;

[[Soviet Census (1937)|The January 1937 census]], the first in 11 years, was intended to reflect the achievements of Stalin's rule. It became evident that population growth particularly in Ukraine failed to meet official targets—evidence of the mortality resulting from the famine and from associated indirect demographic losses. Those collecting the data, senior statisticians with decades of experience, were arrested and executed, including three successive heads of the [[Goskomstat|Soviet Central Statistical Administration]]. The census data itself was locked away for half a century in the Russian State Archive of the Economy.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Shymko, [https://web.archive.org/web/20151222145530/http://spectator.org/articles/44521/politics-genocide "The Politics of Genocide"], ''[[The American Spectator]]'', November 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Merridale]], "The 1937 Census and the Limits of Stalinist Rule" &lt;u&gt;Historical Journal&lt;/u&gt; 39, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent 1939 census was organized in a manner that certainly inflated data on population numbers. It showed a population figure of 170.6 million people, manipulated so as to match the numbers stated by Joseph Stalin in his report to the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party that March. No other census in the Soviet Union was conducted until 1959.

===Soviet campaign in the 1980s===
The Soviet Union denied the existence of the famine until its 50th anniversary, in 1983, when the worldwide Ukrainian community coordinated famine remembrance. The [[Ukrainian diaspora]] exerted significant pressure on the media and various governments, including the United States and Canada, to raise the issue of the famine with the government of the Soviet Union.

While the [[Soviet government]] admitted that some peasantry died, it also sought to launch a disinformation campaign, in February 1983, to blame drought. The head of the directorate for relations with foreign countries for the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), A. Merkulov,&lt;!-- what is his full name?--&gt; charged [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the chief ideologue for the Communist Party in Ukraine, with finding rainfall evidence for the Great famine. This new evidence was to be sent to the [[RIA Novosti|Novosti]] press centers in the U.S. and Canada, denouncing the "antidemocratic base of the Ukrainian bourgeois Nationalists, the collaboration of the [[Stepan Bandera|Banderists]] and the [[Adolf Hitler|Hitlerite]] Fascists during the [[World War II|Second World War]]."&lt;ref&gt;ЦГАООУ. Ф.1. Оп. 25 Д. 2719. Л.27-28. Подлинник.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Please check Bandera link -- that's what is meant there, right? Also, it would be better to write the ref in Latin characters. --&gt; Kravchuk's inquiry into the rainfalls for the 1932-1933 period found that they were within normal parameters.&lt;ref name="Bandera"&gt;Stephen Bandera, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113536/http://www.homin.ca/news.php/news/4781/group/28 "Holodomor as a source of national unity"], ''Ukrainian Echo'', February 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the official position regarding drought did not change.

In February 1983, [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], the Soviet Ambassador to Canada, in a secret analysis "Some thoughts regarding the advertising of the Ukrainian SSR Pavilion held at the International Exposition [[Expo 67|"Man and the world"]] held in Canada" put forward a prognosis for a campaign being prepared to bring international attention to the Ukrainian Holodomor which was spearheaded by the Ukrainian nationalist community. Yakovlev proposed a list of concrete proposals to "neutralise the enemy ideological actions of the Ukrainian bourgeoise nationalists".&lt;ref name="Serhiychuk2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Serhiychuk|first=Volodymyr Ivanovych|script-title=uk:Як нас морили голодом 1932-1933|trans-title=How we were exhausted by Starvation 1932-1933|language=uk|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ckqmGAAACAAJ|edition=3rd|year=2006|publisher=[[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]], Centre for Ukrainian Studies|page=322|isbn=978-966-2911-07-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 1983, the bureau of the Soviet [[RIA Novosti|Novosti Press Agency]] had prepared and sent out a special press release denying the occurrence of the 1933 famine in Ukraine. This press release was sent to every major newspaper, radio and television station as well as University in Canada. It was also sent out to all members of the Canadian parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Сергійчук В.

How we were tired by Famine 1932-33 - Kiev University, Kiev, 2006 page 323&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HolodomorEdmonton.jpg|thumb|right|A Holodomor monument in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], Canada]]

On July 5, 1983 the Soviet Embassy issued an official note of protest regarding the planned opening of a monument in memory of the victims of the Holodomor in [[Edmonton]]&lt;ref name="Serhiychuk, V page 324"&gt;Сергійчук В.

How we were tired by Famine 1932-33 - Kiev University, Kiev, 2006 page 324&lt;/ref&gt; attempting to smear the opening  of the monument.

In October 1983, the World Congress of Ukrainians led by V-Yu Danyliv attempted to launch an international tribunal to judge the facts regarding the Holodomor. At the 4th World Congress of Ukrainians held in December 1983, a resolution was passed to form such an international tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Сергійчук В.

How we were tired by Famine 1932-33 - Kiev University, Kiev, 2006 page 324&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Ukrainian president [[Leonid Kravchuk]] recalled that he was responsible for countering the Ukrainian Diaspora's public education campaign of the 1980s, marking 50 years of the Soviet terror famine in 1983: " In the early 1980s many publications began appearing in the Western press on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of one of the most horrific tragedies in the history of our people. A counter-propaganda machine was put into motion, and I was one of its wheels." The first book on the famine was published in Ukraine only in 1989, after a major shake-up that occurred in the Communist Party of Ukraine when [[Vladimir Ivashko|Volodymyr Ivashko]] replaced [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]] and the Political Bureau decided that such book could be published. However, even in this book, "the most terrifying photographs were not approved for print, and their number was reduced from 1,500 to around 350."&lt;ref&gt;Kravchuk, Leonid Mayemo te, shcho mayemo: spohady i rozdumy, Kiev, 2002, Stolittya (392 p.) {{ISBN|966-95952-8-2}}, pp. 44-46,&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Congress]] created the Commission on the Ukraine famine in 1986. Soviet authorities were correct in their expectation that the commission would lay responsibility for the famine on the Soviet state.&lt;ref name="symp"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Lawriwsky|format=PDF|url=http://www.cym.org/au/archives/Holodomor.pdf|title=The Great Famine of 1932-33 A Symposium|work=National Europe Centre at the Australian National University and the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations|date=22 October 2003|pages=4–5|dead-url=y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041016130758/http://www.cym.org/au/archives/Holodomor.pdf|archive-date=16 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, as President of Ukraine, Kravchuk exposed the official cover-up attempts and came out in support of recognizing the famine, named the "Holodomor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.ua/denmark/ua/8992.htm|title=The Great Famine (Holodomor) in Ukraine in 1932-1933 and its Lessons for the International Community|work=mfa.gov.ua|date=4 December 2007|accessdate=29 February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703115823/http://www.mfa.gov.ua/denmark/ua/8992.htm|archivedate=3 July 2009|postscript=: Oleksa Musienko was the first to use the term ''Holodomor'' on 18 February 1988.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as genocide.&lt;ref name="Bandera" /&gt;

Duranty was well aware of the famine. He said in private to [[Eugene Lyons]] and reported to the British Embassy that the population of Ukraine and Lower Volga had "decreased" by six to seven million.&lt;ref&gt;Embassy dispatch dated 30 September 1933 included the following: "According to Mr. Duranty the population of [[North Caucasus]] and the Lower [[Volga River|Volga]] had decreased in the past year by three million, and the population of Ukraine by four to five million" (cited from ''"Reflections on the ravaged century"'', p. 123)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his reports, Duranty downplayed the impact of food shortages in Ukraine. As Duranty wrote in a dispatch from Moscow in March 1933, "Conditions are bad, but there is no famine... But—to put it brutally—you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytco.com/company/awards/statement.html|title=New York Times Statement About 1932 Pulitzer Prize Awarded to Walter Duranty|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=2007|dead-url=y|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927081606/http://www.nytco.com/company/awards/statement.html|archive-date=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duranty also wrote denunciations of those who wrote about the famine, accusing them of being reactionaries and [[anti-communism|anti-Bolshevik]] [[propaganda|propagandists]]. In August 1933, Cardinal [[Theodor Innitzer]] of [[Vienna]] called for relief efforts, stating that the Ukrainian famine was claiming lives "likely... numbered... by the millions" and driving those still alive to [[infanticide]] and [[cannibalism]]. ''The New York Times'', August 20, 1933, reported Innitzer's charge and published an official Soviet denial: "in the Soviet Union we have neither [[cannibalism|cannibals]] nor [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]]". The next day, the Times added Duranty's own denial.

British journalist [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] (who went hopefully to live in the ''New Civilization'' in 1932, but soon became disillusioned) said of Duranty that he "always enjoyed his company; there was something vigorous, vivacious, preposterous, about his unscrupulousness which made his persistent lying somehow absorbing."&lt;ref&gt;Muggeridge, Malcolm: ''The Green Stick: Chronicles of Wasted Time'' Volume I Chapter 5 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Muggeridge characterised Duranty as "the greatest liar of any journalist I have met in 50 years of journalism."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Conquest]]. ''The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine'' [[Oxford University Press]] (1987), {{ISBN|0-19-505180-7}}, page 320. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bp31GmfH-6YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=harvest+of+sorrow&amp;sig=ONivvVYlMPCPY0pb41NXw-AL8dE#PPA320,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have characterized Duranty as "the number one [[useful idiot|Useful Idiot]] for Lenin first, and later for Stalin."&lt;ref name="Herring"&gt;Mark Y. Herring, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040726150043/http://www.contra-mundum.org/cm/cm15.pdf "Useful Idiot"] (a review of ''Stalin's apologist: Walter Duranty, the New York Times man in Moscow'', by S.J. Taylor), ''Contra Mundum'', nr. 15, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Campaigns were launched in 1986 for the retraction of the Pulitzer Prize given to ''The New York Times''. The newspaper, however, declined to relinquish it, arguing that Duranty received the prize for his reporting several years before the occurrence of the famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Markian Pelech|format=PDF|url=http://duranty.pelech.org/duranty2003/pulitzer2003.pdf|title=Correspondence between Markian Pelech and the Board of Pulitzer Prizes regarding Walter Duranty's 1932 Pulitzer Prize (December 30, 2002 – April 28, 2003)|date=2003|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While conceding that Duranty's coverage of the famine has since been "largely discredited", the ''Times'' noted that: "Duranty's cabled dispatches had to pass [[Soviet censorship]], and Stalin's propaganda machine was powerful and omnipresent. Duranty's analyses relied on official sources as his primary source of information, accounting for the most significant flaw in his coverage - his consistent underestimation of Stalin's brutality."

Some historians consider Duranty's reports from Moscow to be crucial in the decision taken by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to grant the Soviet Union diplomatic recognition in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Berlau]], [http://archive.frontpagemag.com/Printable.aspx?ArtId=17320 "Duranty's Deception"], ''[[Insight (magazine)|Insight]]'', July 22, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Bolshevik [[Karl Radek]] said that was indeed the case.&lt;ref name="regime" /&gt;

=== By prominent visitors to the USSR ===
Prominent British writers who visited the Soviet Union in 1934, such as [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[H. G. Wells]], are also on record as denying the existence of the famine in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Radzinsky"&gt;[[Edvard Radzinsky]] ''Stalin: The First In-depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives'', Anchor, (1997) {{ISBN|0-385-47954-9}}, pages 256-259. According to Radzinsky, Stalin "had achieved the impossible: he had silenced all the talk of hunger... Millions were dying, but the nation hymned the praises of [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivization]]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.monash.edu.au/exhibitions/communism/com107.html|title=Stalin-Wells talk / the verbatim record and a discussion by G.B.

In 1934 the British Foreign Office in the House of Lords stated that there was no evidence to support the allegations against the Soviet government regarding the famine in Ukraine, based on the testimony of Sir John Maynard, a renowned famine expert who visited Ukraine in the summer of 1933 and rejected "tales of famine-genocide propagated by the Ukrainian Nationalists".{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The height of denial was reached during a visit to Ukraine carried out between August 26 and September 9, 1933, by [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Édouard Herriot]], who denied accounts of the famine and said that Soviet Ukraine was "like a garden in full bloom".&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''The [[Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 1999, {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}, pages 159-160&lt;/ref&gt;  The day before his arrival, all beggars, homeless children and starving people were removed from the streets.  Shop windows in local stores were filled with food, but purchases were forbidden, and anyone coming too close to the stores was arrested.  The streets were washed.  Just like all other [[Western World|Western]] visitors, Herriot met fake "peasants", all selected Communists or Komsomol members, who showed him healthy cattle.&lt;ref&gt;''Reflections'', p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  Herriot declared to the press that there was no famine in Ukraine, that he did not see any trace of it, and that this showed adversaries of the Soviet Union were spreading the rumour.  "When one believes that the Ukraine is devastated by famine, allow me to shrug my shoulders", he declared.  The September 13, 1933 issue of ''[[Pravda]]'' was able to write that Herriot "categorically contradicted the lies of the bourgeoisie press in connection with a famine in the
USSR."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Etienne|last=Thevenin|format=PDF|url=http://colley.co.uk/garethjones/ukraine2005/Etienne%20Thevein%20%20English%20translation.pdf|title=France, Germany and Austria: Facing the famine of 1932-1933 in Ukraine|publisher=colley.co.uk|date=29 June 2005|accessdate=4 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401113948/http://www.colley.co.uk/garethjones/ukraine2005/Etienne%20Thevein%20%20English%20translation.pdf|archivedate=1 April 2016|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of knowledge of the famine was observed by English writer [[George Orwell]], who commented that "huge events like the Ukraine famine of 1933, involving the deaths of millions of people, have actually escaped the attention of the majority of English [[Russophilia|Russophiles]]".&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, "Notes on Nationalism" in The ''Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'' (London, 1968), Vol. 3, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Orwell wrote, "[I]t was considered equally proper to publicise famines when they happened in India and to conceal them when they happened in the Ukraine. And if this was true before the war, the intellectual atmosphere is certainly no better now."&lt;ref name=Gareth&gt;{{cite web|author=Nigel Linsan Colley|url=http://www.colley.co.uk/garethjones/soviet_articles/farmer_jones-%20reorder.htm|title=Was Gareth Jones's name behind Orwell's naming of 'Farmer Jones' in Animal Farm?|work=colley.co.uk|date=10 March 2004|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigel Colley has written on the influence of the Ukrainian famine, and the Holodomor denial of Duranty, on Orwell's book ''[[Animal Farm]]''.&lt;ref name=Gareth/&gt;

===Douglas Tottle===
In the 1980s the Soviet Communist Party approached the [[Canadian Communist Party]] to engage journalist [[Douglas Tottle]] to prepare counter-propaganda materials under the title "Fraud, Famine and Ukrainian Fascism". Before final publication, the official reviewers of the tome in Kiev suggested that the name of the book be changed, as stated in their explanation "Ukrainian fascism never existed".&lt;ref name="Serhiychuk, V page 324" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his book, ''Searching for place'', [[Lubomyr Luciuk]] commented: "For a particularly base example of famine-denial literature, see Tottle, ''Fraud, famine, and fascism...''", see Lubomyr Luciuk, ''Searching for place: Ukrainian displaced persons, Canada, and the migration of memory'', Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], 2000, p. 413. {{ISBN|0-8020-4245-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1987, Tottle published his controversial book as ''Fraud, Famine, and Fascism: the Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard'', in which he asserts that claims the Holodomor was an intentional genocide are "fraudulent", and "a creation of [[Nazism|Nazi]] propagandists".&lt;ref name="tottle"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://rationalrevolution.net/special/library/famine.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050411204357/http://www.rationalrevolution.net/special/library/famine.htm |archivedate=2005-04-11 |title=Fraud, famine, and fascism: the Ukrainian genocide myth from Hitler to Harvard |author=[[Douglas Tottle]] |publisher=[[Communist Party of Canada|Progress Books]] |location=Toronto |year=1987 |isbn=0-919396-51-8 |accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book, published by ''Progress Publishers'' in [[Toronto]], appeared around the same time Ukrainian Communist party leader [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]] publicly acknowledged the famine, in December 1987.

In 1988 the [[International Commission of Inquiry Into the 1932–33 Famine in Ukraine]] was set up to establish whether the famine existed and its cause. Tottle was invited by the commission to attend the hearings, however he ignored the request. While the commission was organized along judicial lines, it had no judicial power to compel witnesses to attend or testify. However Tottle's book was examined during the Brussels sitting of the commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jacob W.F.|last=Sundberg|url=http://www.ioir.se/ukrfamine.htm|title=International Commission of Inquiry Into the 1932–33 Famine in Ukraine.

The commission president Professor Jacob Sundberg subsequently concluded that Tottle was not alone in his enterprise to deny the famine on the basis that material included in his book could not have been available to a private person without official Soviet assistance.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.Hobbins, Daniel Boyer, ''Seeking Historical Truth: the International Commission of Inquiry into the 1932-33 Famine in the Ukraine'', Dalhousie Law Journal, 2001, Vol 24, page 166&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
The issue of the Holodomor has been a point of contention between Russia and Ukraine, as well as within Ukrainian politics. According to opinion polls, Russia has experienced an increase in pro-Stalin sentiments since the year 2000,{{r|Monaghan_2015}} with over half viewing Stalin favourably in 2015.{{r|Anon_MT_2015}} Since independence, Ukrainian governments have passed a number of laws dealing with the Holodomor and the Soviet past, with the latest being the "[[Decommunization in Ukraine|Decommunization laws]]" of 2015.{{r|Hyde_2015}} The Russian government does not recognize the famine as an act of genocide against Ukrainians, viewing it rather as a "tragedy" that affected the Soviet Union as a whole. A 2008 letter from Russian president [[Dmitry Medvedev]] to Ukrainian president [[Viktor Yushchenko]] asserted that the famine "was not targeted at extermination of any single nation", and accused Ukraine of exploiting it for political ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Medvedev slams Ukraine's Great Famine stunt|url=https://www.rt.com/news/medvedev-slams-ukraines-great-famine-stunt/|accessdate=1 October 2016|work=RT|date=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010 a leaked confidential U.S. diplomatic cable revealed that Russia had allegedly pressured its neighbors not to support the designation of the Holodomor as a genocide at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08BISHKEK1095_a.html|title=Candid discussion with Prince Andrew on the Kyrgyz economy and the 'Great Game'|date=November 2010|publisher=[[WikiLeaks]]|quote=He [Prince Andrew, Duke of York] stated the following story related to him recently by Azerbaijan's President Aliyev.

Prince Andrew added that every single other regional President had told him of receiving similar 'directive' letters from Medvedev except for [Kyrgyz president] Bakiyev.|accessdate=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another leaked document, Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] described Israel's recognition of the Holodomor as "historical revisionism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli FM Lieberman in Moscow|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09MOSCOW1488_a.html|publisher=Wikileaks|quote=The FMs discussed expanding bilateral economic ties, and Lavrov raised Russian concern that Israel was partaking in 'historical revisionism' that sought to blame Russia for the Ukrainian famine of the 1930s.|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denial literature===
In 2006, the All-Ukrainian Public Association "Intelligentsia of Ukraine for Socialism" published a pamphlet titled "''The Myth of the Holodomor''" by G. S. Tkachenko. The pamphlet claimed that Ukrainian Nationalists and the US government were responsible for creating the "myth." Russian publicist [[Yury Mukhin (author)|Yuri Mukhin]] has a published a book titled "''Hysterical Women of the Holodomor''", dismissing Holodomor as "Russophobia" and "a trump card of  the Ukrainian Nazis." Sigizmund Mironin's "''Holodomor in the Rus''" argued that the cause of the famine was not Stalin's policies, but rather the chaos engendered by the [[New Economic Policy]].{{r|Dobczansky_2009}}

Russian state media ran several articles denying the severity and causes of the Ukrainian famine.{{r|Young}}

===Ukrainian law===
On November 28, 2006, Ukraine's parliament, the [[Verkhovna Rada]], passed a law recognizing the 1932&amp;ndash;1933 Holodomor as an act of genocide against  the Ukrainian people. The voting figures were as follows: supporting the bill were [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc|BYuT]]—118 deputies, [[Our Ukraine (political party)|NSNU]]—79 deputies, [[Socialist Party of Ukraine|Socialists]]—30 deputies, 4 independent deputies, and the [[Party of Regions]]—2 deputies (200 deputies did not cast a vote). The [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] voted against the bill.  In all, 233 deputies supported the bill—more than the minimum of 226 votes required to pass it into law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110404031008/http://www.day.kiev.ua/179841 "Holodomor and Holocaust denial to be a criminal offense"], 3 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucorg.com/news.php/news/2241 "What the Verkhovna Rada actually passed"], 28 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A draft law "On Amendments to the Criminal and the Procedural Criminal Codes of Ukraine" was submitted by [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] for consideration by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament]].  The draft law envisaged prosecution for public denial of the Holodomor Famine of 1932&amp;ndash;1933 in Ukraine as a fact of genocide of the Ukrainian people, and of [[the Holocaust]] as the fact of genocide of the [[Jews|Jewish people]]. The draft law foresaw that public denial as well as production and dissemination of materials denying the above shall be punished by a fine of 100 to 300 untaxed minimum salaries, or imprisonment of up to two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://91.194.250.169/en/148/388891/|title=Public denial of Holodomor Famine of 1932-1933 in Ukraine as genocide of Ukrainian people to be prosecuted|work=UR1|date=10 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227123610/http://91.194.250.169/en/148/388891/|archivedate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The draft law, however, failed to receive support from incoming President [[Viktor Yanukovych]], who, following his inauguration in 2010, declared: "it would be wrong and unfair to recognize the Holodomor as an act of genocide against one nation"&amp;mdash;this among a number of actions seen as his pursuing a more Russocentric policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alexander J.|last=Motyl|author-link=Alexander J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10569">The '''draining law''' or '''Belgian dry up law''' (droogleggingswet) refers to a controversial{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} law passed by the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]] in 2005 to cut funding by the federal state to "undemocratic" parties. Due to restrictions against campaign donations from private groups or individuals, Belgian political parties rely mostly on the state for funding.

Although the term "draining law" usually refers to the law passed in 2005, there are actually two so-called "draining laws":
*the law of 12 February 1999, inserting an article 15 in the law of 4 July 1989 regarding the limitation and control of the electoral expenses for the elections of the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|federal Chambers]], the financing and the open accounts of the political parties, and of an article 16bis in the laws on the [[Council of State (Belgium)|Council of State]], coordinated on 12 January 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The law of 12 February 1999 inserted an article 15ter in the law regarding party financing which states that if a political party by its own effort or by the effort of its components, lists, candidates or elected officials, clearly and with several similar signs, shows that it is hostile towards the rights and liberties guaranteed under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], it can be stripped of its funding by the [[Council of State (Belgium)|Council of State]]. This is why in [[French language|French]], the law is also referred to as the "law to cut funding to anti-liberty parties" ("''loi permettant de priver les partis liberticides de leur financement''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this provision could not be implemented until the passage of the law of 17 February 2005.

At the present time an attempt to use the law would most likely be made against the [[far-right politics|far-right]] [[Flanders|Flemish]] party [[Vlaams Belang]]. A Belgian court ruled in 2004 that the party's predecessor [[Vlaams Blok]] had encouraged discrimination against foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the party's supporters, both the 2004 conviction and the current bill are political actions by their opponents.

After the Supreme Court ruling, the leadership of the VB seized the occasion to dissolve itself, and start afresh under a new name.[14] On 14 November, the Vlaams Blok thus disbanded itself, and the Vlaams Belang was established. The Vlaams Belang instituted a number of changes in its political program, carefully moderating some of the more radical positions of the former Vlaams Blok.[15] Nevertheless, the party leader Frank Vanhecke made it clear that the party would fundamentally remain the same; "We change our name, but not our tricks. We change our name, but not our programme."[8]

Former Vlaams Blok chairman Frank Vanhecke was chosen as chairman of the Vlaams Belang on 12 December 2004.[16] Like its predecessor, the Vlaams Belang has continued to be subjected to the cordon sanitaire, wherein all the traditional Flemish parties has agreed to systematically exclude the party, and never form a coalition with it. This situation was however altered slightly with the emergence of the smaller right-wing party List Dedecker (founded in 2007), which has not joined in on the agreement.[17] In an interview with the popular weekly Humo, Flemish Prime Minister Yves Leterme for instance declared that a local chapter of his Christian Democratic and Flemish party (CD&amp;V) that would form a coalition or close agreements with the Vlaams Belang, would no longer be considered part of the CD&amp;V.[18]

The VB contested the 2006 municipal elections on the theme of "Secure, Flemish, Liveable". The VB enjoyed a massive increase of votes, and its council members almost doubled, from 439 to about 800. The election result was described by the party as a "landslide victory."[19] In Antwerp, the VB's vote count ran behind that of the Socialist Party, which increased their share of the vote dramatically.[19] Nevertheless, the VB, which was in a coalition with the minor VLOTT party, slightly increased their vote in the city to 33.5%.[19] In the 2007 general election, the party won 17 seats in the Chamber of Representatives and five seats in the Senate, remaining more or less at status quo. Earlier the same year, the party joined the short-lived European Parliament group Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty alongside parties such as the French National Front.[20]

In 2008, Bruno Valkeniers was chosen as new party chairman for the VB, having contested the position unopposed.[21] In 2009, the party contested elections for the Flemish Parliament and the European Parliament. The party was reduced from 32 to 21 seats (from the Vlaams Blok's record 24%, to 15%) in the Flemish parliament, and from three to two seats in the European parliament. In the 2010 general election, the party was again reduced, to 12 seats in the Chamber, and three in the Senate. This was largely due to the great success of the more moderate new party New Flemish Alliance, which also campaigned on Flemish independence.[22] After the party suffered heavy losses during the local elections of 2012 Bruno Valkeniers stepped down as party chairman and was succeeded by Gerolf Annemans.

In the 2014 federal and regional elections the party again suffered a big loss and was reduced to 5.9% of the Flemish vote. The European list, pulled by Annemans, scored slightly better with 6.8%. Annemans resigned as party leader, a function he only performed for two years, and argued for a rejuvenation of the party. The following party chairman election was won by the only candidate, the then 28 years old Tom Van Grieken.

{{About|a past  political think tank in Europe|the current official Documentation Centres of the European Commission|European Documentation Centre}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:European Documentation Centre logo.gif|right|thumb|Logo for a European Documentation Centre]] --&gt;
{{nofootnotes|date=August 2015}}
The '''European Documentation and Information Centre''', abbreviated '''CEDI''' ({{lang-fr|Centre Européen de Documentation et d'Information}}), was a former [[think tank]] founded in 1952 on the occasion of an international congress held in [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], [[Spain]]. The objective of the organization was to unite various European conservative and Christian Democratic political organizations which formed in several Western European states during [[World War II|postwar]] reconstruction, the emerging [[Cold War]] and the beginnings of what would later be called [[European integration]]. During the 1950s and the 1960s, the CEDI was an important contact pool for European politicians. During its early years the CEDI's ideology and program was dominated by its first president, [[Otto von Habsburg]], son of the last emperor of Austria. It was dissolved in 1990 following the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]].

== Backgrounds ==

The [[Spain under Franco|Franco regime in Spain]] made use of the CEDI to get in contact with high-ranking persons of the political, military, economic and cultural life from Western Europe and thus end its post-war [[international isolation]]. By preaching the necessity of cultural exchange and the religious unity of the occident, the CEDI aimed at a political, military and economic inclusion of Spain into the beginning process of [[European Integration]].

== Organization and members ==

The annual congresses of the CEDI, which were nearly always held in [[Spain]], brought together many office bearers and dignitaries of the conservative milieu. Besides the Spanish initiators – hereunder [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]’s foreign minister [[Alberto Martín Artajo]], the director of the Institute for Hispanic Culture [[Alfredo Sánchez Bella]] and [[José Ignacio Escobar Kirkpatrick Marqués de Valdeiglesias]] – there was a strong support for CEDI’s activities in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[France]]. The expelled Austrian Heir Apparent [[Otto von Habsburg]] was the founding and, later on, honorary president of the organization. Germany was represented by high-ranking members of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] parties, as for example the ministers [[Hans-Joachim von Merkatz]] and [[Richard Jaeger]]. The French section of the Documentation Centre was led by the Count [[François de la Noë]] and [[Michel Habib-Deloncle]].

Among the first British supporters were [[William Teeling]], [[Frederick Corfield|Sir Frederick Corfield MP]] and [[Sir Peter Agnew, 1st Baronet|Sir John Rodgers MP]], who even held CEDI’s international presidency from 1965 to 1967. Over the years, the Austrian secretary general [[Georg von Gaupp-Berghausen]] turned more and more out to be the actual organizational and programmatic head of the Documentation Centre.

== Ambitions and ideology ==

Besides the proclaimed Catholic Christian heritage, the traditional connections of the European upper nobility, military contacts and common economic interests, it was above all a virulent [[anticommunism]] which was tying together the members of the Documentation Centre. The scientific lectures given at the annual meetings of the CEDI dealt with questions of principle concerning [[European Integration]], the [[Cold War]] and other subjects of social and international relevance.

== National sections ==

Apart from [[Spain]], [[Germany]] and [[France]], national sections emerged in and [[Belgium]] and [[Austria]], some years later also in [[Liechtenstein]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Portugal]]. In Britain, the conservative "[[March Club]]" fulfilled the tasks of a national section since the beginning of the 1960s. Among the most prominent members of this British section were apart from Teeling, Corfield and Rodgers, [[Peter Agnew]] and [[Geoffrey Rippon]] who both were to become international presidents of the CEDI later on. It seems quite likely that the contacts provided by the Documentation Centre played a not unimportant role in negotiating Britain’s entry into the [[European Community]], since Rippon was the head of the British government’s delegation.

== Development ==

When the CEDI became a civil law association in 1957, its head office was officially moved to [[Munich]], [[Madrid]] remaining nevertheless a central branch office of the organization.
With General [[Charles de Gaulle]] returning to the political stage in 1958, his fellows transformed the CEDI into an international forum in order to diffuse their conceptions of European politics. The cooperation between [[Gaullism|French Gaullists]] and [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|German Christian Democrats]] has also been prepared by CEDI’s initiatives.

The Gaullist engagement weakening by the end of the 1960s, Spanish influence in the Documentation Centre increased again. CEDI evolved into an instrument of Spanish interests in Latin America, reached out for Africa and Asia, and finally turned toward the domain of [[Development aid|development policies]].

Nevertheless, the organization had transgressed the zenith of its diplomatic activities. The urgent necessity of recruiting new members was perceived, but the CEDI did not find any solution to solve these problems. The political transformation process in [[Spain]] by the middle of the 1970s deprived the CEDI of its last material and organizational basics.

====Programs with States of Former Soviet Union====

::United States Congress encourages the Secretary of Defense to participate actively in joint research and development programs with the independent states of the former Soviet Union through the nongovernmental foundation established for this purpose by the [[Freedom Support Act|FREEDOM Support Act of 1992]]. To that end, the Secretary of Defense may spend those funds authorized for support, technical cooperation, in-kind assistance, and other activities with the following purposes:
:::(1) To advance defense conversion by funding civilian collaborative research and development projects between scientists and engineers in the United States and in the independent states of the former Soviet Union.
:::(2) To assist the establishment of a market economy in the independent states of the former Soviet Union by promoting, identifying, and partially funding joint research, development, and demonstration ventures between United States businesses and scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs in those independent states.
:::(3) To provide a mechanism for scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs in the independent states of the former Soviet Union to develop an understanding of commercial business practices by establishing linkages to United States scientists, engineers, and businesses.
:::(4) To provide access for United States businesses to sophisticated new technologies, talented researchers, and potential new markets within the independent states of the former Soviet Union.
:::(5) To provide productive research and development opportunities within the independent states of the former Soviet Union that offer scientists and engineers alternatives to emigration and help prevent proliferation of weapons technologies and the dissolution of the technological infrastructure of those states.

The '''Freedom and Prosperity Party''', formerly known as '''No Carbon Tax Climate Sceptics''' and '''The Climate Sceptics''', were an [[Australia]]n political party that describes itself as the world's first political party representing [[climate sceptic]]s, dedicated to "...expose the fallacy of anthropogenic climate change".

The party was registered with the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] in early 2010, and endorsed candidates to stand in the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]]. Prior to being registered, party supporters stood as independent candidates in the [[Bradfield by-election, 2009|Bradfield]] and [[Higgins by-election, 2009|Higgins by-elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | page = 9 | last = Dodson | first = Louise | title = Sex heats up byelection campaigns | newspaper = [[Australian Financial Review]] | date = 13 November 2009 |url =  http://afr.com.au/p/national/sex_heats_up_byelection_campaigns_0wpkK9Dl4t5cE15BdrVzTP?hl |accessdate = 19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral==
The party endorsed 10 candidates for the Senate, and 6 for the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections. None were successful.

==Position on aspects of global warming==
The Climate Sceptics Party position on what they call [[climate alarmism]] is

* Climate science is far from “settled”, as evidenced by the revelations of recent months and years.
* The alarmist theories propounded by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) and other political bodies are crippled by huge uncertainties.
* An objective and quantitative risk–benefit analysis of any proposed “climate” legislation is crucial.

===Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme===
The Climate Sceptics Party's policy on the Australian government's proposed [[emissions trading scheme]], the [[Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme]] (CPRS), is that the CPRS will result in Australian industry being at a competitive disadvantage leading to rising prices, that the CPRS will also cause corruption and fraud and the curtailing of human freedoms.

==Actions==
On 13 July 2009, approximately 30 members of the Climate Sceptics Party and supporters arrived at the venue where [[Al Gore]], was speaking in [[Melbourne]], to hand out leaflets for those attending, with questions to ask Al Gore during his speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessday.com.au/business/greenies-have-a-field-day-at-brekkie-20090713-diva.html|title=Greenies have a field day at brekkie|accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some wore T-shirts bearing the party's slogan: "Carbon Really Ain't Pollution - CRAP".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 2010 the Climate Sceptics organised a tour of Australia by [[Lord Monckton]] at a cost of $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/jan/13/climate-scepticism-talk-lord-monckton|title=Lord Monckton climate change lecture costs Australian sceptics $100,000|accessdate= 23 April 2011 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Leo | last=Hickman | date=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's name on the [[Australian Electoral Commission]]'s register was changed to "No Carbon Tax Climate Sceptics" on 14 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/party_registration/Registration_Decisions/3061.htm|title=Approval of application from The Climate Sceptics to change its name to "No Carbon Tax Climate Sceptics"|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party has been involved in [[Glenn Druery]]'s [[Minor Party Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-05/bitter-dispute-erupts-over-senate-preferences-in-queensland/4939300 Bitter dispute erupts over Senate preferences in Queensland: ABC 5 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/special-features/alliance-of-micro-parties-boosts-odds-for-likes-of-one-nation-or-shooters-and-fishers-gaining-senate-spot-through-preferences/story-fnho52jp-1226713114765 Alliance of micro parties boosts odds for likes of One Nation or Shooters and Fishers gaining Senate spot through preferences: Daily Telegraph 5 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6539">'''Friedrich Glasl's model of conflict escalation''' assists in the analysis of conflicts. Appropriate reactions can be derived from this analysis. The model has nine stages – in contrast to the earlier model of Kurt R. Spillmann,&lt;ref&gt;Kurt R. Spillmann und Kati Spillmann: ''Feindbilder. Entstehung, Funktion und Möglichkeiten ihres Abbaus''. In: Zürcher Beiträge zur Sicherheitspolitik und Konfliktforschung Nr. 12, 1989, S. 19 ff&lt;/ref&gt; which describes five distinct stages of [[Conflict escalation|escalation]]. These stages are grouped into three levels, which each contain three stages.

== Levels ==
Glasl represents "escalation in his nine stage model not as an ascent to higher and higher stages of escalation, but as a descent to deeper and deeper, more primitive and more inhuman forms of dispute... [which] inevitably leads into regions that evoke great 'inhuman energies' which are not ultimately amenable to human control or restraint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.umsetzungsberatung.de/konflikte/konflikteskalation.php |title=Konflikteskalation: Wie die Unversöhnlichkeit stufenweise wächst |website=Umsetzungsberatung.de |date= |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first level both parties can still win ([[Win-win game|win–win]]). In the second level one of the parties loses and the other wins (win–lose), and in the third level both parties lose (lose–lose).

[[File:Glasl's Model of Conflict Escalation.svg|thumb|upright=3.0|center|The nine stages of conflict escalation]]

Many different kinds of conflict can be thus analysed: [[divorce]]s, conflicts between colleagues and school children, and also conflicts between states.

=== 1st Level (Win–Win) ===
; Stage 1 – Tension
Conflicts start with tensions, e.g. the occasional clash of opinions. This is a common occurrence and is not perceived as the start of a conflict. However, if a conflict should result the positions become more fundamental. The conflict could have deeper causes.

;Stage 2 – Debate
From now on the conflict parties consider strategies to convince the counterparty of their arguments. Differences of opinion lead to a dispute. The parties try to put each other under pressure and think in terms of black and white.

; Stage 3 – Actions instead of words
The conflict parties increase the pressure on each other in order to assert their own opinion. Discussions are broken off. No more verbal [[communication]] takes place and the conflict is increasingly acerbated. Sympathy for "them" disappears.

=== 2nd Level (Win–Lose) ===
;Stage 4 – Coalitions
The conflict is acerbated by the search for sympathisers for one's cause. Believing one has right on one's side, one can denounce the opponent. The issue is no longer important: one has to win the conflict so that the opponent loses.

;Stage 5 – Loss of face
The opponent is to be denigrated by innuendo and the like. The loss of trust is complete. Loss of face means in this sense the loss of moral credibility.

;Stage 6 – Threat strategies
The conflict parties try to gain absolute control by issuing threats which demonstrate their own power. One threatens, for example, with a ''demand'' (10 million euros) which is enforced by a ''sanction'' ("otherwise I′ll blow up your main building") and underlined by the ''potential for sanction'' (showing the explosive). The proportions decide the credibility of the threat.

=== 3rd Level (Lose–Lose) ===
;Stage 7 – Limited destruction
One tries to severely damage the opponent with all the tricks at one's disposal. The opponent is no longer regarded as human. From now on, limited personal loss is seen as a gain if the damage to the opponent is greater.

;Stage 8 – Total annihilation
The opponent is to be annihilated by all means.

; Stage 9 – Together into the abyss
From this point personal annihilation is accepted in order to defeat the opponent.

== Strategies for de-escalation and conflict solution ==
The model describes how two parties in a conflict behave. Solutions leading to [[de-escalation]] are not immediately apparent in this model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friedenspaedagogik.de/themen/kriegsgeschehen_verstehen/krieg/konflikteskalation/die_neun_stufen_der_konflikteskalation_nach_glasl |title=Die neun Stufen der Konflikteskalation nach Glasl / Konflikteskalation / Krieg / Kriegsgeschehen verstehen / Kriege / Materialien / Home - Institut für Friedenspädagogik Tübingen e.V |language=de |website=Friedenspaedagogik.de |date= |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly when it appears to both conflict parties impossible to reverse the situation (e.g. an aggressive act on the territory of a state, separation of a common child from the other parent, withdrawal of nationality by a state, mass redundancy to improve shareholder value), or when one party selects conflict escalation as a strategic ploy.

To achieve de-escalation Glasl assigns the following strategic models to the different stages of escalation:
* Stage 1–3: mediation
* Stage 3–5: process guidance
* Stage 4–6: sociotherapeutic process guidance
* Stage 5–7: intercession, intermediation
* Stage 6–8: arbitration, court action
* Stage 7–9: forcible intervention

The ability to recognise and eliminate conflict-nourishing forces in a culturally neutral and non-judgemental fashion in order to de-escalate a conflict is highly advantageous in particular for managers, consultants and social workers.

The '''Geneva Centre for Security Policy''' (GCSP) is an international foundation that was established in 1995 under [[Swiss]] law to "promote the building and maintenance of peace, security and stability". The GCSP was founded by the [[Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports]] in cooperation with the [[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]] as a Swiss contribution to [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP).

==Location==
[[file:Maison de la paix petals 1 and 2.jpg|thumb|180x180px|right|The Maison de la paix 2013]]
GCSP's headquarters are in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] in the [[maison de la paix]] building (the ''house of peace''), which is owned by the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The "Maison de la paix" |url=http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/about-us/campus_paix/maison_paix.html |publisher=The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies |accessdate=18 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019120926/http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/about-us/campus_paix/maison_paix.html |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It shares the building with the Graduate Institute, the [[Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining]] (GICHD), and the [[Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces]] (DCAF). It is the main element of the ''campus de la paix'' (the ''campus of peace'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dufour|first=Nicolas|title=La Maison de la paix, "une effervescence pour Genève"|url=http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/d36202b4-25fe-11e3-ad2a-8501617392fc/La_Maison_de_la_paix_une_effervescence_pour_Gen%C3%A8ve#.UmFAr5QpZMU|accessdate=18 October 2013|newspaper=Le Temps|date=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
GCSP's core activity is the provision of executive education and training in comprehensive international peace and security policy for mid-career [[diplomat]]s, [[military officer]]s, and [[civil servants]] from foreign, defence, and other relevant ministries, as well as from [[international organisation]]s. Participants in GCSP courses come from countries of the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]], [[NATO]]'s [[Mediterranean Dialogue]], the [[Istanbul Cooperation Initiative]], and beyond, including South and East Asia and Africa. In addition to its three long-term courses (each lasting from three to nine months) offered in [[Geneva]], the GCSP also offers tailor-made courses in Geneva, [[New York City]], [[Dakar]], [[Amman]], [[Baku]], [[Addis Ababa]], [[Yerevan]] and [[Sarajevo]].

GCSP's work focuses on [[regional development]], emerging [[security]] challenges, [[leadership]], and crisis and conflict management.

==Governance and funding==
[[File:Katrin Göring-Eckardt, Francois Heisbourg (cropped).jpg|thumb|Francois Heisbourg 2015]]
The GCSP's governing body is the Foundation Council, which consists of representatives of 48 member states and the Canton of Geneva. The chairman of the Foundation Council is [[François Heisbourg]]. The director of the GCSP is [[Christian Dussey]].

The Swiss government is the principal contributor to GCSP's budget. Other council members, partner states, and institutions also support the GCSP by seconding faculty, funding scholarships, and contributing to other aspects of the centre's activities.

'''Green municipalism''' refers to the encouragement of [[environmentalism]] from the [[municipality|municipal]], rather than state or national basis.

It has been discussed by [[Brian Milani]] in his book, ''[[Designing the Green Economy]]'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greeneconomics.net/Book3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] / Onondaga County Green Party Chapter at the US National Green Gathering of August 1992.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etext.org/Politics/AlternativeOrange/2/v2n1_gpp.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lal Nishan Party''' (Red Flag Party, LNP) was a [[Communism|communist]] [[political party]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Maharashtra]].

LNP's main work was trade union activism. The trade union of the party was called Sarva Shramik Sangh (SSS).

The party publication was called ''Nave Parva''. Earlier, SSS published a [[Marathi language|Marathi]] daily newspaper from [[Pune]] called ''Shramik Vichar''.

During the 1980s, LNP developed a close cooperation with [[Kamgar Aghadi]].{{cn|date=January 2016}}

In 1988, a split occurred when a hardline section, critical of the [[Perestroika]], broke away and formed [[Lal Nishan Party (Leninvadi)]].

LNP participated in the [[Confederation of Indian Communists and Democratic Socialists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lal-Nishan-Party/news Lal Nishan]. Times of India. Accessed 5 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 August, LNP merged with the [[Communist Party of India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-lal-nishan-party-to-merge-with-cpi-2526022]. DNA India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://in.news.yahoo.com/lal-nishan-party-merges-cpi-162700699.html]. Yahoo India&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2640">'''Land Court''' or '''Land claims court''' is a type of court which is charged with dealings over cases involving land titles and for disputes between [[landlord]]s and tenants relating to [[Tenant farmer|agricultural tenancies]]. The exact field of [[jurisdiction]] varies by country.

==Africa==

The Land Claims Court of the Republic of South Africa was established in 1995 and has the same status as the High Courts of that country. The court specializes in hearing disputes that arise out of laws that underpin South Africa's land reform initiative.  These are the Restitution of Land Rights Act, 1994, the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act, 1996 and the Extension of Security of Tenure Act, 1997.This is in line with the South African Constitution which gave people and communities who had been dispossessed of land after 19 June 1913 as a result of racially discriminatory laws or practices the right to restitution of that property or to fair compensation. The Court also fulfils an important function in reviewing certain decisions of inferior courts.

{{Violence against women}}

Brazil's Federal Law 11340, also known as ''Lei Maria da Penha'' (Portuguese: [[Help:IPA/Portuguese|[ˈlej mɐˈɾi.ɐ dɐ ˈpẽɲɐ]]], ''Maria da Penha Law'') targets gender based violence in Brazil, with the specific aim of reducing [[domestic violence]] in the country. Sanctioned on August 7, 2006 by former President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] and subsequently implemented on September 22, 2006, the law is an important contribution to an international movement of criminalizing violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clas.berkeley.edu/event/“punishing-gender-violence-brazil’s-‘maria-da-penha-law|title=Marta Rodriguez de Assis Machado

== Background ==
Violence against women, specifically domestic violence, remains a pervasive issue in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Tamar Diana|date=2014|title=Introduction: Violence against Women in Latin America|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24573973|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=41|issue=1|pages=3–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic violence can be defined as, “physical, sexual, and verbal aggression…typical of machismo and a way to strengthen men's power within the household, especially if they feel economically insecure.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Tamar Diana|date=2014|title=Introduction: Violence against Women in Latin America|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24573973|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=41|issue=1|pages=3–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic violence is a systemic issue in Brazil with a 2015 government survey stating that "over 70% of the Brazilian female population will suffer some kind of violence throughout their lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Domestic violence in Brazil|date=2018-11-25|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domestic_violence_in_Brazil&amp;oldid=870553474|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Fórum Brasileiro de Segurança Pública, 66% of Brazilian men have perpetrated violence against a woman in his community and 70% of Brazilian women identified as having experienced some form of violence in a public space before the age of 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forumseguranca.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/relatorio-pesquisa-vs4.pdf|title=A Victimização de Mulheres no Brasil|last=|first=|date=|website=Fórum Brasileiro de Segurança Pública|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2017, an in-depth examination of gender based violence in Brazil determined that only a quarter of women who experience violence by the hands of an intimate partner report incidents to the authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/21/brazil-domestic-violence-victims-denied-justice)%20https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/brazilian-college-student-s-post-accusing-wealthy-boyfriend-domestic-violence-n917876|title=Human Rights Watch|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite strong statistical evidence supporting widespread violence against women in Brazilian households, few legal initiatives existed in Brazil to challenge this systematic violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Maria da Penha Case and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights: Contributions to the Debate on Domestic Violence Against Women in Brazil on JSTOR|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.121.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:83d72b09499b6f0fcad3bd29bdee5fbd|language=en|doi=10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.121.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2009, domestic abuse could be dismissed by the court if the woman was not deemed to be  “honest.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/1e0777014a90412cbfbe9686b02e72b7|title=Despite strong laws, domestic violence in Brazil is rampant|date=2018-09-21|work=AP NEWS|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, with intense media focus on the high profile case of Maria da Penha, the Brazilian government created the Maria da Penha Law (named in da Penha’s honor) in an attempted response to international criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/1e0777014a90412cbfbe9686b02e72b7|title=Despite strong laws, domestic violence in Brazil is rampant|date=2018-09-21|work=AP NEWS|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of her 23 year marriage, Maria da Penha was domestically abused by her husband, resulting in da Penha becoming paraplegic after two murder attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Maria da Penha Case and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights: Contributions to the Debate on Domestic Violence Against Women in Brazil on JSTOR|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.121.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:83d72b09499b6f0fcad3bd29bdee5fbd|language=en|doi=10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.121.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these events, da Penha, along with the Center for Justice for International Law (CEJIL) and the Latin American Committee for the Defense of Women's Rights (CLADEM), spent the next twenty years fighting her husband through the Brazilian legal system; da Penha filed a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, emphasizing the need for the state to intervene in combating gender based violence in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Maria da Penha Case and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights: Contributions to the Debate on Domestic Violence Against Women in Brazil on JSTOR|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.121.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:83d72b09499b6f0fcad3bd29bdee5fbd|language=en|doi=10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.121.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components of the Law ==
The Maria da Penha law aims to reduce domestic violence mainly by increasing punishment for domestic abuse offenders, increasing the maximum detention time from one to three years, establishing domestic violence courts and requiring Brazilian authorities to institute 24 hour shelters for victims of household domestic abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/1e0777014a90412cbfbe9686b02e72b7|title=Despite strong laws, domestic violence in Brazil is rampant|date=2018-09-21|work=AP NEWS|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law specifically states that domestic violence between [[Homosexuality|same-sex partners]] and domestic abuse perpetrated by woman towards a man in a heterosexual relationship also constitute punishable crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2011/8/maria-da-penha-law-a-name-that-changed-society|title=Maria da Penha Law: A Name that Changed Society|work=UN Women|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the law provides protective measures to the victim, empowering judges to temporary restraining orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/21/brazil-domestic-violence-victims-denied-justice|title=Human Rights Watch|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Maria da Penha law, ruling that prosecutors “may bring domestic violence cases regardless of whether the victim presses charges or not.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t892sk|title=World report 2013: Events of 2012|last=WATCH|first=HUMAN RIGHTS|date=2013|publisher=Bristol University Press|isbn=null|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Implementation==

==== Supportive Response ====
With the implementation of the Maria da Penha Law, Brazil arguably has one of the most progressive pieces of legislation addressing domestic violence in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/fact_sheets/Brazil2.pdf|title=WHO-Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women, Brazil|last=|first=|date=|website=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Institue of Applied Economic Research (Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada), the ''Lei Maria da Penha'' has had a positive impact in reducing domestic violence against women in Brazil, with their study showing a 10% decrease in projected domestic homicides rates since 2006 ('''xxx'''). While statistical evidence supports the positive impacts of the law in Brazil, many in Brazil still feel more must be done to address high levels of domestic violence in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/23/hitting-women-isnt-normal-tackling-male-violence-brazil|title='Hitting women isn't normal': tackling male violence in Brazil|last=Johnson|first=Sarah|date=2018-08-23|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Critical Response ====
Those critical of the effectiveness of the law point to failures in the law’s implementation. Speaking to these concerns, Brazil director at Human Rights Watch, Maria Laura Canineu said, “ The Maria da Penha law was a major step forward, but more than a decade later, implementation remains woefully inadequate throughout much of the country.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/21/brazil-domestic-violence-victims-denied-justice|title=Human Rights Watch|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, these shortcomings include the failure of police to follow procedure when a woman reports an incident of violence, the practice of demanding women undergo invasive medical procedures to prove abuse, the lack of a private space for the victim to share a testimony, and the failure to carry out protection orders against offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/31/brazils-women-violence-begins-home|title=Human Rights Watch|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, political turmoil in Brazil has defunded many government programs protecting domestic violence victims, specifically women of color from low socio-economic classes who are already denied access to adequate health and legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/1e0777014a90412cbfbe9686b02e72b7|title=Despite strong laws, domestic violence in Brazil is rampant|date=2018-09-21|work=AP NEWS|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also observed in limited access to the special units established by the law; most special units are located only in major Brazilian cities, isolating women in rural areas of the country and causing them to travel long distances for help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/21/brazil-domestic-violence-victims-denied-justice|title=Human Rights Watch|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/1e0777014a90412cbfbe9686b02e72b7|title=Despite strong laws, domestic violence in Brazil is rampant|date=2018-09-21|work=AP NEWS|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the logistical issues that remain, the culture of machismo in Brazil continues to stand as a major barrier for women seeking justice. "Crimes that occurred inside the house are, in general, consider less serious than those committed in the public sphere. The cultural acceptance of domestic violence aggravated this problem.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Maria da Penha Case and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights: Contributions to the Debate on Domestic Violence Against Women in Brazil on JSTOR|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.121.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:83d72b09499b6f0fcad3bd29bdee5fbd|language=en|doi=10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.121.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; da Penha herself has been outspoken and critical about the effectiveness of the law, stating, “The problem is not the law but in its application…”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/brazil-domestic-abuse-video-tv-attitudes-debate-fantastico-a8484361.html|title=Brazil shocked into national debate on domestic abuse following broadcast of graphic video|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mauro Merlino''' (born December 14, 1969) is a social and political activist in [[Modena, Italy]] whose work has gained international notoriety for his peaceful movements, and set freedom of speech precedents in Italian court of law regarding social media.

== Equitalia and Freedom of Speech ==

Mauro Merlino known for his Italian public protest against tax giant [[Equitalia]] circa 2013-2016 which turned into a "David and Golitath" court case of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imolaoggi.it/2015/09/27/mauro-merlino-davide-contro-equitalia-golia/|title=Imola Today|website=Imola Today|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact Merlino created a YouTube video gone viral about the tax collection office,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.napolitan.it/2015/06/08/23732/la-storia-di-mauro-merlino-querelato-da-equitalia-per-un-video-su-internet/|title=The Story of Mauro Merlino Video on Internet|website=Napolitan|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is Italy's version of the IRS. Equitalia differs in that it has exorbitant tax rates and compounded fines imposed if taxes are unpaid. In the forty second video  he stated in his own opinion that Equitalia could incite suicide to citizens due to their high tax rates and heavy collection tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedompress.cc/clamoroso-mauro-merlino-grida-vittoria-accuso-equitalia-di-istigazione-al-suicidio/|title=FreedomPress|website=www.freedompress.cc|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His "I will sell a kidney just to pay my taxes" slogans went viral, being picked up by mainstream media.  Soon after the video went viral it was removed from [[YouTube]], and a libel "defamation" lawsuit brought upon him.  Merlino fought back in social media with a lawsuit that took several years to be brought to court in Modena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvqui.it/video/home/137616/EQUITALIA--PROCESSO-A-MODENA-.html|title=TV QUI |website=www.tvqui.it|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Merlino's victory against former President of Equitalia, Attilo Befera,  was widely publicized, setting a precedent for Italian freedom of speech and opinion on social media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/cos-ho-costretto-befera-comparire-tribunale-1240942.html|title=The Giornale Italy|website=www.ilgiornale.it|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gaining him much notoriety in his hometown of Modena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gazzettadimodena.gelocal.it/modena/cronaca/2016/08/09/news/mauro-merlino-protesta-pubblica-contro-equitalia-1.13941610 |title=ModenaGazette|website=ModenaGazette|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== TV and MiniSeries About Mauro Merlino's Equitalia Case ==

Merlino appeared on Quinta Colonna, (Fifth Column) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.video.mediaset.it/video/quinta_colonna/clip/equitalia-giu-la-maschera_562469.html|title=TV QUI |website=www.tvqui.it|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; a popular talk show on [[Mediaset]] one of Italy's main television stations discussing his case and peaceful protest. During this protest, he was joined by political activists including the [[Five Star Movement]]. Merlino had gone on a hunger strike, wore a [[Guy Fawkes]] mask and a coffin was set on fire, which created much publicity for the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gazzettadimodena.gelocal.it/modena/cronaca/2015/09/28/news/contro-equitalia-sfila-una-bara-davanti-al-tribunale-di-modena-1.12170358|title=Gazette of Modena |website=gazettadimodena.gelocal.it|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, MediaSet studios would make a small miniseries of his trials and tribulations regarding the case on the show "Striscia La Notizi" (Strictly News).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.striscialanotizia.mediaset.it/news/a-striscia-la-notizia-le-parole-di-un-contribuente-denunciato-per-diffamazione-dall%E2%80%99ex-direttore-di-equitalia-attilio-befera_8455.shtml|title=Striscia La Notizia |website=www.striscialanotizia.mediaset.it/|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gay and Lesbian Rights ==

Merlino served as President of the Italian "Gay [[Harvey Milk]] Association" for several years circa 2012 protesting gay, lesbian, and transgender rights for Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tuttouomini.it/mauro-merlino-vicepresidente-dellharvey-milk-protesta-a-modena/27671/|title=Vice President Gay Harvey Milk Protests in Modena|date=2012-06-18|website=TuttoUomini|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To this day, his work is recognized and followed by gay and lesbian groups in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.i-want-to-break-free.org/mauro-merlino-earthquake-victims/|title=Mauro Merlino Brings Solidarity to Earthquake Victims|date=2015-03-04|website=I Want To Break Free|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protesting Financial Crisis As Superhero Spider-Man ==

In August 2016, Merlino started dressing as [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]] to protest the lack of support and aid given to the financial crisis of Italy.  He started walking the squares of the towns first in hometown of Sassuolo,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bologna.press/news/13902/l-uomo-ragno-al-mercato-mattinata-sassolese-per-mauro-merlinoe|title=Spider-Man in the Square of Sassuolo|date=2016-08-02|website=Bologna Press|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other regions such as Reggio Emilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gazzettadireggio.gelocal.it/reggio/cronaca/2016/08/12/news/l-uomo-ragno-predica-nel-deserto-1.13957149|title=Spider-Man Sermon in the Desert|date=2016-08-12|website=gazzettadireggio.gelocal.it|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to bring awareness to the financial crisis of Italy. During this process he helped a local business owner at the Manhattan Coffee Bar protest a $5000 Euro fine imposed by the police for installment of video cameras to protect his business. A fundraiser was organized by Merlino of which over 100 people attended and donated to raise money for the fine, so the bar owner could stay in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvqui.it/video/home/139942/l-uomo-ragno-a-modena-contro-la-crisi.html|title=To the Crisis Comes Spider-Man |date=2016-08-08|website=TV QUI|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earthquake Protests as Spider-Man ==

By late August 2016, attention was diverted to the victims of the 2016 6.2 Earthquakes impacting central Italy (namely the [[Amatrice]] region). He began marching in the squares of several towns, and ended up trekking over 300 miles to bring solidarity to the victims by suggesting a "smile iniative" for the children impacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faccionotizia.gelocal.it/iltirreno/edizione-di-prato/carmignano/2017/02/11/bambini-non-abbiate-paura-spider-man-e-con-voi/|title=Don't Worry Children Spider-Man is With You|date=2017-02-11|website=faccionotizia.gelocal.it/iltirreno|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests took place in Modena,with the help of other superheros &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leggo.it/news/italia/un_gesto_di_solidarieta_piedi_da_modena_amatrice_vestito_da_uomo_ragno-2292667.html|title=A Gesture of Solidarity Walking to Amatrice with Spider-Man|date=2017-03-02|website=Leggo|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mantua (Mantova).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vocedimantova.it/articoli/155973/Spider-Man-in-giro-per-la-citta|title=Spider-Man in the City|date=2017-03-25|website=Voice of Mantua|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he would travel to the Earthquake zone in the snow,talking to the mayor of [[Rieti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rietilife.com/2017/01/08/spiderman-modena-ad-amatrice-piedi-limpresa-mauro-merlino/|title=Spider-Man of Modena Walks to Amatrice|date=2017-03-08|website=ReitiLife|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Health (MOH) of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)''' ({{lang|ru|Министерство здравоохранения СССР}}), formed on 15 March 1946, was one of the most important government offices in the Soviet Union. It was formerly (until 1946) known as the '''People's Commissariat for Health''' ({{lang|ru|Народный комиссариат здравоохранения}}). The Ministry, at the all-Union level, was established on 6 July 1923, after the signing of the [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR]], and was, in turn, based upon the People's Commissariat for Health of the [[RSFSR]] formed in 1917. The Ministry was led by the [[Minister of Health]], prior to 1946 a Commissar, who was nominated by the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] and confirmed by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet]], and was a member of the Council of Ministers.

==Duties and responsibilities==
The main duties of the ministry were to develop and to prepare these for legislation and to maintain a decent level of health organisation in the USSR. The ministry missariat monitored and supervised the application of standards and measures to improve Soviet [[health care]]. According to the July 1936 decree establishing the People's Commissariat for Health, the commissariat had control over all financial assets related or linked to [[health care]]. As such, the ministry controlled all financial functions regarding health. It coordinated medical personnel all over the country, but also local council deputies.&lt;ref name="formShealth"/&gt; MOH was obliged to take active measures against deficiencies in the health care system, and to further develop and implement measures to improve it.&lt;ref name="duties"&gt;{{Cite web| author = [[Government of the USSR]] | script-title=ru:О МЕРАХ ПО ДАЛЬНЕЙШЕМУ УЛУЧШЕНИЮ ЗДРАВООХРАНЕНИЯ И РАЗВИТИЮ МЕДИЦИНСКОЙ НАУКИ В СТРАНЕ |trans-title=On measures to further enhance the health and development of medical science in the country | url = http://bse.sci-lib.com/article045265.html | accessdate=25 October 2010|date= |work=[[Great Soviet Encyclopaedia]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MOH, with the help of other ministries and Soviet institutions, was responsible for the construction of new medical institutions around the country. Maintenance of hospital and other medical institutions were carried out by the MOH and the [[State Committee for Construction]].&lt;ref name="duties"/&gt; According to the [[Regulations on the Ministry of Health of the USSR]], MOH was responsible for maintenance and the construction of public health care services, and organising and conducting forensic medical and forensic psychiatric examination and establishing public [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical service]]s. It was also assigned to develop and publish guidelines on organising and improving [[Curative medicine|curative]] and [[preventive care]], maternal and child health and to oversee the formulation of [[therapeutic]] and preventive work in health care.&lt;ref name="longduty"&gt;{{Cite web| author = [[Government of the USSR]] | script-title=ru:К разработке основ законодательства о здравоохранении|trans-title=To develop a legal framework on public health | url = http://www.law.edu.ru/article/article.asp?articleID=1172604 | accessdate=25 October 2010|date= |publisher=[[Business Law Institute]] of [[The State University of Management]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competence of the MOH within the [[jurisdiction]] of the USSR was periodically reviewed by the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]].&lt;ref name="longduty"/&gt;

==Organisation==
The Ministry of Health was an [[all-union]] ministry, which meant that it controlled the fifteen ministries of health of the [[union republic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Feldbrugge, Ferdinand J. | page = 160 | title = Russian Law: The End of the Soviet System and the Role of Law | location = | publisher = [[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]] | year = 1993 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yP9ac9ZRsogC&amp;dq | isbn = 0-7923-2359-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The union health ministries, in turn, were in charge of the [[autonomous oblast]]s and district health departments. The union ministries, along with the oblasts and the district health departments, were in control of the [[public hospital]]s and [[medicine]] in their area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Filtzer, Donald A. | page = 109 | title = Soviet workers and late Stalinism: labour and the restoration of the Stalinist system after World War II | location = | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 2002 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-2ODXMKLLw4C&amp;dq | isbn = 0-521-81503-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A July 1936 [[decree]] by the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union|Central Executive Committee]] and the [[Council of People's Commissars]] established the People's Commissariat for Health. [[Grigory Kaminsky]], having served as [[People's Commissar for Health of the RSFSR]], became the first commissar of the all-union commissariat for health. Kaminsky was arrested in 1938 after his speech in 1937 which denounced the ongoing [[stalinist]] repression in the country ([[Great Purge]]). In a very short period of time since the formation of the commissariat, the diseases and viruses which had for a long time been a major problem had been eliminated.&lt;ref name="formShealth"&gt;{{Cite web| author = Sorokina, Tatyana | script-title=ru:История медицины |trans-title=History of Medicine  | url = http://www.bibliotekar.ru/423/35.htm | accessdate=14 October 2010|date= |publisher=bibliotekar.ru|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, the People's Commissariat for Health was renamed Ministry of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = | script-title=ru:Здравоохранение: Значение слова "Здравоохранение" |trans-title=Health: Meaning of the word "health" | url = http://bse.sci-lib.com/article045265.html | accessdate=25 October 2010|date= |work=[[Great Soviet Encyclopaedia]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In United States [[real estate]] business, "[[net lease]]" is a term used for an arrangement in which the tenant or lessee is responsible for paying, in addition to base rent, some or all of the expenses related to real-estate ownership.  These expenses, often called the "three nets", are [[property taxes]], [[insurance]], and [[Common area maintenance charges|maintenance]].&lt;ref name="womeninbusiness.about.com"&gt;[http://womeninbusiness.about.com/od/commercialleasingterms/g/net-lease.htm Leasing Definitions - What Does "Net Lease" Mean?]&lt;/ref&gt;  As the rent collected under a net lease is net of expenses, it tends to be lower than rent charged under a [[gross lease]].  Net lease types include [[Single net lease|single net]], [[Double net lease|double net]], and triple net leases, with the term "net lease" often being used as a shorthand expression for any of these arrangements.  A triple net lease (i.e. one that is net of all three of the major expense categories) is often abbreviated in writing as "'''NNN lease'''", but is still pronounced as "triple net lease".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.stanford.edu/~sgren/seminar/commercial-leasing.pdf

==Variations of the NNN lease==

===Single-tenant net lease===
NNN leased investments are generally leased to one single tenant and are thus referred to as STNLs or Single Tenant Net Leases. A NNN lease investment can however have two or more tenants, though it would not be considered an STNL investment. An example of this would be a [[Starbucks]] &amp; [[MetroPCS]] which share a building under two separate NNN leases, or a retail strip center where all tenants are wrapped into one NNN lease. Both examples would be considered NNN leased investments; however they would not be STNLs. The risk of default is spread out over more than one tenant in such NNN deals (i.e. if either Starbucks or Metro PCS goes bankrupt, the other tenant continues to pay the rent due under their NNN lease). Such deals can appeal to [[investor]]s seeking to spread [[financial risk|risk]], though the simplicity of collecting one rent check from one tenant is forfeited.

===Double net lease===
Another variation of the NNN lease is the NN lease or "Net-Net" lease which is pronounced "double net" where the "net" amounts generally are property tax and insurance.&lt;ref name="womeninbusiness.about.com"/&gt; Double net leases, like triple net leases, are usually, though not always, single-tenant arrangements, however the [[landlord]] carries some extra financial maintenance obligation. The term "Net Lease" is tossed around loosely in the net lease industry, often used when referring to a triple or double net lease; however there is a definite distinction between a triple net and a double net lease even though some brokers erroneously use the term "Net Lease" to describe both. Double net leased investments generally trade at a slightly higher [[capitalization rate|CAP rate]] than triple net leased investments, because of the maintenance expenses which the landlord is responsible for. Brand new NN Deals with long-term builder [[warranty|warranties]] covering the roof and sometimes structure can be attractive to investors looking for a higher return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/NNN/1031/prweb3922064.htm Investor 1031 Exchanges Triple Net Taco Bell for New Double Net O'Reilly's&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thennnmarket.blogspot.com/2015/01/dollar-general-net-leased-offering-3.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk==
Though NNN leased investments are considered to be highly risk-averse investments, especially when leased to a national credit tenant, the landlord is still exposed to some financial risk. In the fine print of most NNN leases these risks are specified. For instance, who carries the obligation to rebuild after a casualty (natural disasters included) or whether the tenant must continue paying rent should the property be condemned? In other instances, certain risks (e.g. fluctuations in property taxes) cannot be completely accounted for in the initial contract, forcing the landlord to estimate these costs early on. In this scenario, if the landlord's accountant does not follow through with changing the invoices appropriately, it may cost the landlord thousands of dollars by the end of the taxable year. Although NNN lease investments carry relatively low risk, they require high levels of oversight for these reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Hipp, Jon. "[http://www.calkain.com/newsletter/2011/2011Q2Newsletter.pdf The Importance of a Net Lease Administration]." Net Lease Advisor (2011): 2-3. Calkain Companies. Calkain. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one variation of a NNN lease contract, the "bondable NNN lease" (sometimes referred to as a "true triple net" or "absolute triple net" lease), the tenant cannot terminate the lease or seek any rent abatements under any circumstances, a provision that mitigates some of the risk for the landlord.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brokersus.com/what-is-a-triple-net-leased-investment-nnn-leases/ What is a Triple Net Leased Investment (NNN Lease)?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==

=== For investors ===
==== NNN lease ====
Investors can benefit from NNN lease properties in a variety of ways. In NNN leases tenants take on the responsibility of major expenses such as HVAC and roof repairs keeping the operation cost lower for the landlord. Typically NNN leases have lower rent per square foot rates which increases the tenant pool when a landlord is ready to lease the property. For specific tenants, landlords will frequently modify leases allowing for greater flexibility and higher tenant retention.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Benefits of a Triple Net Lease - KW Net Lease Advisors|url = http://kwnetlease.com/benefits-of-a-triple-net-lease/|accessdate = 2015-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Absolute net lease ====
Most investors in today's net lease market prefer an investment that is truly passive, therefore, an absolute net lease is a requirement for many of these investors. Investors prefer to hold these assets long-term, which means there is likely some wear and tear maintenance, as well as a roof that will need to be replaced at some point. With an absolute net lease in, the risk of expenses associated with building maintenance shifts solely to the tenant, allowing the landlord to receive a 100% passive investment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== NNN 1031 exchange ====
In its simplest form, a 1031 exchange is a [[tax deferral]] strategy for real estate transactions in which a property owner or investor sells one property and purchases another within a specific time frame. However, the transaction must qualify as a "like kind" exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.triplenet1031exchanges.com/|title=Triple Net 1031 Exchanges - NNN Properties|website=Triple Net 1031 Exchanges - NNN Properties|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For tenants ===
Often a NNN lease will offer a lower monthly rent than a gross lease since the tenant will be responsible for maintaining the building. In a NNN lease tenants are responsible for maintenance and repairs, therefore cost savings for expenses related to operating the building are passed on to the tenant instead of the landlord.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Common misconceptions==
A "bondable NNN lease", the most extreme form of a NNN lease investment, is often used incorrectly in the net lease industry when referring to NNN properties which are merely occupied by investment-grade tenants.  The tenant's credit rating is a crucial factor which the lender takes into account in their decision to lend on a property and under what terms; however, it is not the characteristic which distinguishes a bondable triple net from a standard triple net lease investment.
When evaluating the value of the credit tenant’s credit, most brokers, and lenders, base their analysis on the credit rating garnered by one of the major credit agencies (Moody’s, Standard &amp; Poor’s, Dunn &amp; Bradstreet).  Though these ratings are important, they don’t always paint the most accurate picture of a company’s overall performance and future viability.  Some brokers offer the services of an in-house stock broker and analyze the credit tenant’s financials and stock performance when the tenant is publicly traded on an exchange. A great deal can be learned by examining the credit tenant’s stock performance in comparison to other industry competitors.  Other readily available metrics such as the [[price earnings ratio|P/E ratio]], [[PEG ratio]], and [[debt-to-equity ratio]] can be indicators of a credit tenant’s financial health.

==Components and values of single-tenant leases==
The value of a net leased investment is determined by the value of the real estate, the value of the credit tenant, and the value of the lease itself.
#In a standard NNN leased investment the landlord owns the land and building while collecting rent from the tenant.  If the tenant chooses to leave or the landlord decides he wants a different tenant when the lease term is up, he still owns the building and land.  The location of the land and the potential of re-leasing it should be taken into account. Planned developments in the area as well as current and future demographic trends all affect the real estate’s value.  The physical building should also be factored in when determining the real estate’s value.
#The second determinant of value is the quality of the credit tenant.  This is generally determined by the tenant’s current credit rating and past financial reports. Future financial projections are also an important indication of financial strength. Most investors use the [[Standard and Poor's]] credit ratings. In order to qualify as an investment grade tenant, the company must be rated at lease BBB- by Standard and Poor's. Properties leased by credit tenants are in the highest demand and therefore command a lower [[capitalization rate]] than non-investment grade tenants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cookcre.com/nnn-properties-for-sale NNN Properties] | CookCRE&lt;/ref&gt;
#The third determinant of value is the lease itself.  As mentioned previously NNN leases are more valuable than NN leases because the landlord is responsible for some of the expenses in a double net lease.  The length of the lease is also a determinant of value (20 years of guaranteed income will be worth more than say 10 or 15 year terms). Generous rental increases, also known as rent bumps, add value to the lease and protect the landlord against inflation.  Some leases also have a percentage rent kick in if their gross sales hits a certain CAP.  Most leases grant the tenant options to renew (several short term options put the landlord in a weaker position when it comes time to re-new the lease). Are the current rents called for in the lease below market?  If they are the landlord has the opportunity to command higher rents when the lease term is up.

==Net lease planning as an investment tool==
NNN lease planning is a rich investment tool which provides the investor with many opportunities to navigate an ever-changing market.  NNN lease investments are essentially inflation-protected [[bond (finance)|bonds]] guaranteed by a credit tenant, rather than a state or local [[municipality]].  The tenant makes monthly payments to the landlord, while the real estate (and often rent bumps called for in the lease) provides the investor protection against inflation.  Bonds have long been a popular investment tool among retirees and high-income earners seeking [[fixed income]] without having to pay taxes for years. NNN lease investments provide similar [[tax advantage]]s as tax-exempt municipal bonds, without forcing the investor to settle for lower yields or opening the investor up to a large capital gains hit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/answers/bondmun.htm Municipal Bonds]&lt;/ref&gt;  If an investor were to purchase a bond in the [[secondary market]] and turn around and sell it for a profit years later, he would have to pay a capital gains tax on the profit, regardless of whether or not the bond is exempt from state income tax.  This is not the case when investing in NNN leases because of the fact that although structured like a bond, they are still considered real estate investments and therefore fall under the same tax laws as such which means that they can be depreciated in the same manner as similar income producing commercial real estate. The taxes on the income they generate can be written off or deferred over the life of the asset.  The investor of course has to pay said depreciation back when he sells, however this too can be circumvented by evoking a Starker’s 1031 exchange and trading into another like-kind property.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=179801,00.html Like-Kind Exchanges Under IRC Code Section 1031]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offmarketnnn.com/blog/what-is-a-1031-exchange What is a 1031 Exchange ]&lt;/ref&gt;   NNN leased investments are also financeable allowing the investor to leverage the credit of their tenant and the interest payments would also be a write-off. In addition to the numerous tax benefits, retirees often choose NNN leases when planning their estate or retirement because of the straight forward nature of NNN lease investments.  A retiree can achieve long term, guaranteed, fixed income with rental increases from a simple product and their Heirs will not be overwhelmed by the many complications associated with wealth management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thennnmarket.blogspot.com NNN Leased Investment Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Off-market NNN properties===
An off-market NNN property is a NNN property that is available for sale, but not publicly marketed. Many investors and developers prefer off-market transactions for a variety of reasons, one of which is controlling the publicity of the availability of the property, which could create issues with other lease negotiations on other deals. There are several professional commercial real estate brokers that specialize in off-market NNN properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investmentsalesgroup.com InvestmentSalesGroup.com] Off Market NNN Properties&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2689">'''The New Commonwealth''' was an international organization created in London in 1932 with branches in France and Germany. It advocated pacifism, disarmament and multilateral resolution of conflicts through political lobbying and different publications.

== Aims ==
The New Commonwealth was created in October 1932 in London, with the forme Labour MP [[George Barnes (British politician)|George Barnes]] as its first President, and the French [[Henry de Jouvenel]], the German [[Ernst Jäckh]] and the American [[Oscar T. Crosby]] as vice-president.&lt;/ref&gt;''First Annual Report of The New Commownealth'', London, The New Commonwwealth, 1933, internal cover.&lt;ref&gt; It advocated the creation of an international tribunal and an international police force.&lt;/ref&gt;''First Annual Report of The New Commownealth'', London, The New Commonwwealth, 1933, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, it defended the creation of an international air force which would act as a military arm of the [[League of Nations]], promoting disarmament and keeping the world's peace. Those promoting the New Commonwealth included the millionaire [[David Davies, 1st Baron Davies]], who became its chairman, others who had taken part in building up the [[League of Nations Union]], and [[Winston Churchill]], who was elected as the organization's president. [[Ernst Jaeckh]] was appointed as international director.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;[[Perry Anderson]], ''The New Old World'' (2011), p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech to the Society in May 1937, Churchill said {{Quote|We are one of the few peace societies that advocates the use of force, if possible overwhelming force, to support public international law.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Muller, ''Churchill's "Iron Curtain" Speech Fifty Years Later'' (1999), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some of the ideas of the New Commonwealth Society were later incorporated into the [[United Nations Charter]].

== Publications ==
To promote its aims, the Society published a monthly, ''The New Commonwealth'', from 1932 to 1950. It also published a quarterly from 1935 to 1943, first named ''New Commonwealth Quarterly'', later renamed the ''London Quarterly of World Affairs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neurath|first1=Otto|title=Empiricism and Sociology|date=1973|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company|location=Dordrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Otto Neurath]] figured in its editorial committee. It also published many pamphlets and books.

'''Ough''' is a letter sequence often seen in words in the [[English language]]. In [[Middle English]], where the spelling arose, it was pronounced with a back rounded vowel and a [[Velar fricative (disambiguation)|velar fricative]] (e.g., {{IPA-enm|oːx|}}, {{IPA-enm|oːɣ|}}, {{IPA-enm|uːx|}}, or {{IPA-enm|uːɣ|}}). The sequence is ambiguous, having at least eight pronunciations in [[North American English]] and nine in [[British English]]; its pronunciation depends entirely on its placement in a given word, with the most common being:

*{{IPAc-en|oʊ}} as in ''though'' (cf. ''t'''oe''''').
*{{IPAc-en|uː}} as in ''through'' (cf. ''tr'''ue''''').
*{{IPAc-en|ʌ|f}} as in ''rough'' (cf. ''r'''uff'''ian'').
*{{IPAc-en|ɒ|f}} as in ''cough'' (cf. ''c'''off'''in'').
*{{IPAc-en|ɔː}} as in ''thought'' (cf. ''t'''au'''t'').
*{{IPAc-en|aʊ}} as in ''bough'' (cf. ''to b'''ow''''' [the gesture])

* {{IPAc-en|s|l|ʌ|f}} (as in "to slough off", meaning to shed off)
* {{IPAc-en|s|l|aʊ}} the town of [[Slough]] in the [[Thames Valley]] of England or the [[Slough of Despond]] in ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]

An example sentence using the nine pronunciations commonly found in modern usage (and excluding ''hough'', which is now a rarely-used spelling) is, "The wind was rough along the lough as the ploughman fought through the snow, and though he hiccoughed and coughed, his work was thorough."

Other pronunciations can be found in proper nouns, many of which are of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] origin (Irish, Scottish, or Welsh) rather than English. For example, ough can represent {{IPAc-en|ɔː|k}} in the surname [[Coughlin]], {{IPAc-en|j|uː}} in Ayscough and even {{IPAc-en|iː}} in the name Colcolough ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|k|l|iː}}) in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolton|first1=H. Carrington|title=The Pronunciation of Folk-Names in South Carolina|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|date=1891|volume=4|issue=14|pages=270–272|doi=10.2307/534017|jstor=534017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two occurrences of {{angle bracket|ough}} in the English place name [[Loughborough]] are pronounced differently, resulting in {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ʌ|f|b|ə|r|ə}}. Additionally, three parishes of [[Milton Keynes]]—[[Woughton]] {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ʌ|f|t|ən}}, [[Loughton]] {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aʊ|t|ən}} and [[Broughton, Milton Keynes|Broughton]] {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɔː|t|ən}}—all have different pronunciations of the combination.

''Tough'', ''though'', ''through'' and ''thorough'' are formed by adding another letter each time, yet none of them rhyme. 

Some humorous verse has been written to illustrate this seeming incongruity:
* "A rough-coated, dough-faced ploughman strode, coughing and hiccoughing, thoughtfully through the streets of Scarborough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Variable Symbol|work=[[Punch (magazine)|Punch, or the London Charivari]]|volume=68|date=16 January 1875|url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=XaYwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spelling reforms ==
Because of the unpredictability of the combination, many [[English-language spelling reform|English spelling reformers]] have proposed replacing it with more phonetic combinations, some of which have caught on in varying degrees of formal and informal success. Generally, spelling reforms have been more widely accepted in the [[United States]] and less so in other English-speaking areas. One problem is that a pronunciation with the velar fricative is still found locally in parts of North-East Scotland, where, for example, ''trough'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|t|r|ɔː|x}}.

In April 1984, at its [[Annual general meeting|yearly meeting]], the [[Spelling Society|Simplified Spelling Society]] adopted the following reform as its [[style guide|house style]]:&lt;ref name="gibbs1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722030140/http://www.englishspellingsociety.org/journals/j8/implications.php#gib "The Society's 1984 Proposals"]. ''Journal of the Simplified Spelling Society'' (February 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englishspellingsociety.org/aboutsss/leaflets/tough.php "Tough Though Thought – and we call it correct spelling!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416090527/http://www.englishspellingsociety.org/aboutsss/leaflets/tough.php |date=2011-04-16 }}. ''Simplified Spelling Society'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

*Shorten {{angle bracket|ough}} to {{angle bracket|u}} when it is sounded as {{IPAc-en|uː}}: ''through'' → ''thru''.
*Shorten {{angle bracket|ough}} to {{angle bracket|o}} when it is sounded as {{IPAc-en|oʊ}}: ''though'' → ''tho'' (but ''doh'' for ''dough'').
*Shorten {{angle bracket|ough}} to {{angle bracket|ou}} when it is sounded as {{IPAc-en|aʊ}}: ''bough'' → ''bou'', ''plough'' → ''plou'', ''drought'' → ''drout''.
*Change {{angle bracket|ough}} to {{angle bracket|au}} when it is sounded as {{IPAc-en|ɔː}}: ''ought'' → ''aut'', ''bought'' → ''baut'', ''thought'' → ''thaut''.
*Change {{angle bracket|ough}} to {{angle bracket|of}} or {{angle bracket|uf}} (depending on pronunciation) when there is the sound {{IPAc-en|f}}: ''cough'' → ''cof'', ''enough'' → ''enuf'', ''tough'' → ''tuf''.

=== Already standard ===
*''hiccup'' instead of [[folk etymology]] ''hiccough''
*''hock'' instead of ''hough'' (word is rare in the United States)
*''plow'' instead of ''plough'' (standard in [[American English]])

=== Already varyingly formal ===
In the UK, the word ''dough'' can also be pronounced {{IPAc-en|d|ʌ|f}}, a pronunciation remembered in the spelling in the word ''duffpudding''. Likewise, the word ''enough'' can be pronounced {{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|n|aʊ}} or {{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|n|oʊ}} and the spelling ''enow'' is an acceptable dialect or poetic spelling (e.g. "[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|And Wilderness is Paradise enow.]]").

The following spellings are generally considered unacceptable in other areas, but are standard in the United States:
*''naught'' instead of ''nought'' (standard in the United States, although the word is only used in phrases such as "all for naught") – some archaic uses of ''nought'' have been replaced with ''not''
*''plow'' instead of ''plough'' (standard in the United States and Canada, with ''plough'' being occasionally used to refer to the horsedrawn variety)
*''slew'' or ''sluff'' instead of the two corresponding pronunciations of ''slough'' (the former is very common in the United States, the latter much less so, with ''slough'' being retained in most cases)
*''donut'' instead of ''doughnut''

=== Common informal ===
*''thru'' instead of ''through'': it is a common abbreviated spelling in the US and standard on road signs, where it conserves space and is quicker to read: e.g., "drive thru" for [[drive-through]] and "thru traffic" for "through traffic"&lt;ref&gt;Example: "ROAD CLOSED TO THRU TRAFFIC", [http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part2/fig2b_29_longdesc.htm sign R11-4], [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''tho'' and ''altho'' instead of ''though'' and ''although'' (sometimes [[Contraction (grammar)|contracted]] as '' tho&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and '' altho&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'')
However, both of these are considered unacceptable in written British English and formal American English, with the exception of in the most casual and informal forms of textual conversation.

=== Rare informal ===
*''coff'' instead of ''cough'' – [[Koffing]]
*''laff'' instead of ''laugh'' (British comic variant ''larf'') – [[Laffy Taffy]]
*''enuff'' or ''enuf'' instead of ''enough'' – [[Tuff Enuff]]
*''tuff'' instead of ''tough'' – Tuff Enuff, Tuff Shed
*''ruff'' instead of ''rough'' (seldom used because it often refers to an [[onomatopoeia]] for a dog's bark)

== Comparable combinations ==
{{unreferencedsection|date=November 2017}}
{{angle bracket|augh}} is orthographically rather similar to {{angle bracket|ough}}, but admits much less pronunciation variation:
*{{IPAc-en|ɔː|,_|ɒ|,_|ɑː}} as in ''caught'', ''fraught'', ''daughter'', ''slaughter''
*{{IPAc-en|æ|f|,_|ɑː|f}} as in ''laugh'', ''draught'', ''laughter''

The similar {{angle bracket|ow}} yields at least five standard pronunciations:

*{{IPAc-en|aʊ}} as in ''cow'', ''now'', ''bow'' (stoop), ''sow'' (pig), ''row'' (fight), ''glower'' (glare), ''town'', ''owl'', etc.
*{{IPAc-en|oʊ}} as in ''crow'', ''know'', ''bow'' (weapon), ''sow'' (plant), ''row'' (bank), ''lower'' (let down), ''own'', ''bowl'', etc.
*{{IPAc-en|ɒ}} as in ''knowledge'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɒ|l|ᵻ|dʒ}}, ''acknowledge'' {{IPAc-en|ə|k|ˈ|n|ɒ|l|ᵻ|dʒ}}
*{{IPAc-en|uː}} as in ''bowie knife'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|uː|i}}
*{{IPAc-en|ɔː}} as in ''bowdlerize'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔː|d|l|ə|r|aɪ|z}} (also {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|d|-}} and {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aʊ|d|-}})

Dialectal forms also render pronunciations such as ''winder'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|n|d|ər}}, ''yeller'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɛ|l|ər}} for ''window'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|n|d|oʊ}}, ''yellow'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɛ|l|oʊ}}, and ''fella'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɛ|l|ə}}, ''tomorra'' {{IPAc-en|t|ə|ˈ|m|ɒ|r|ə}} for ''fellow'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɛ|l|oʊ}}, ''tomorrow'' {{IPAc-en|t|ə|ˈ|m|ɒ|r|oʊ}}.

A comparable group is {{angle bracket|omb}}, which differs however in that, unlike {{angle bracket|ough}}, it does not ever represent a single [[phoneme]]. {{angle bracket|omb}} can be pronounced in at least five ways:
*{{IPAc-en|ɒ|m|,_|ɑː|m}} as in ''bomb'' {{IPAc-en|b|ɒ|m}} (rhymes with ''Tom'')
*{{IPAc-en|oʊ|m}} as in ''comb'' {{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|m}}, ''clomb'' {{IPAc-en|k|l|oʊ|m}} (rhymes with ''home'')
*{{IPAc-en|uː|m}} as in ''tomb'' {{IPAc-en|t|uː|m}}, ''womb'' {{IPAc-en|w|uː|m}} (rhymes with ''gloom'')
*{{IPAc-en|ʌ|m}} as in ''aplomb'' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|l|ʌ|m}} (rhymes with ''gum'')
*{{IPAc-en|ə|m}} as in ''buncombe'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʌ|ŋ|k|ə|m}}, ''coxcombry'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|k|s|k|ə|m|r|i}}

When a syllable is added after the {{angle bracket|omb}}, the {{angle bracket|b}} is often (but not always) pronounced, resulting in a total of at least eight pronunciations of {{angle bracket|omb}}:
*{{IPAc-en|ɒ|m|.|b}} as in ''somber'' (UK ''sombre'') {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɒ|m|.|b|ər}}, ''rhombus'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɒ|m|.|b|ə|s}}, ''zombie'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɒ|m|.|b|i}}, ''combat'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|m|.|b|æ|t}}, ''wombat'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɒ|m|.|b|æ|t}}, etc.
*{{IPAc-en|ʌ|m|.|b}} as in ''Colombia'' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|ʌ|m|.|b|i|ə}}
*{{IPAc-en|ə|m|.|b}} as in ''combine'' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|m|ˈ|b|aɪ|n}}
—but not, for example, in ''bomber'', ''comber'', ''entombing'', etc.

The group {{angle bracket|oth}} also has a wide variety of pronunciations, in part because of the two phonemes ({{IPAc-en|θ}} and {{IPAc-en|ð}}) represented in English {{angle bracket|th}}. Here are seven different pronunciations:

*{{IPAc-en|oʊ|θ}} as in ''loth'', ''lothario'', ''quoth'', ''sloth'' (UK), ''troth''
*{{IPAc-en|ɒ|θ|,_|ɔː|θ|,_|ɑː|θ|}} as in ''apothecary'', ''bothy'', ''broth'', ''brothel'', ''cloth'', ''froth'', ''Goth'', ''moth'', ''sloth'' (US), ''wroth''
*{{IPAc-en|ʌ|θ}} as in ''nothing''
*{{IPAc-en|ə|θ}} as in ''behemoth'', ''mammoth''
*{{IPAc-en|oʊ|ð}} as in ''betroth'', ''clothe''
*{{IPAc-en|ɒ|ð|,_|ɑː|ð|}} as in ''bother''
*{{IPAc-en|ʌ|ð}} as in ''another'', ''brother'', ''mother'', ''other'', ''smother''

The group {{angle bracket|ong}} has at least nine pronunciations, though unlike with {{angle bracket|ough}} or {{angle bracket|omb}}, context often suggests the correct pronunciation:

*{{IPAc-en|ɔː|ŋ|,_|ɒ|ŋ|,_|ɑː|ŋ}} as in ''long'', ''prong'', ''song'', ''strong'', ''thong'', ''tong'', ''wrong''
*{{IPAc-en|ɔː|ŋ|.|ɡ|,_|ɒ|ŋ|.|ɡ|,_|ɑː|ŋ|.|ɡ}} as in ''longer'', ''Mongol'', ''congress''
*{{IPAc-en|ɔː|n|dʒ|,_|ɒ|n|dʒ|,_|ɑː|n|dʒ}} as in ''congee'', ''longevity'', ''longitude'', ''pongee''
*{{IPAc-en|ʌ|ŋ}} as in ''among'', ''tongue''
*{{IPAc-en|ʌ|ŋ|.|ɡ}} as in ''humongous'', ''monger'', ''mongrel''
*{{IPAc-en|ʌ|n|dʒ}} as in ''allonge'', ''sponge''
*{{IPAc-en|ə|n|.|ɡ}} as in ''congratulate''
*{{IPAc-en|ə|n|.|dʒ}} as in ''congeal'', ''congest''
*{{IPAc-en|ɒ|n|.|ɡ|,_|ɑː|n|.|ɡ}} as in ''mongoose''

'''Petro-sexual politics''' is a lens used to better understand the relationships between [[petroleum]] and gender violence and the role [[colonial powers]] possess.  The underlying theme of petro-sexual politics is that gender violence is part of a larger [[political economy]] of violence.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turcotte|first=Heather|title=Contextualizing petro-sexual politics|journal=Alternatives: Global, Local, Political|date=June 2011|volume=3|issue=36|pages=200–220|doi=10.1177/0304375411418597}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Petro-sexual politics can yield new methods of theorizing [[global politics]],&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turcotte|first=Heather|title=Petro-sexual politics: global oil, legitimate violence and transnational justice|journal=Doctoral Dissertation|date=June 2008|pages=1–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as explained here for the [[Nigeria]]n case of the "[[natural resource curse]]". 
{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Waves}}

==Introduction==
[[File:Location Nigeria AU Africa.svg|thumbnail|Location of Nigeria (dark blue)]]

Typically petro-violence is lumped together with the term [[ethnic conflict]].  These conflicts have deep colonial roots driving them.  These colonial powers label conflicts with terms such as "[[terrorist activity]]" or "[[gang violence]]" in order to retain colonial power and maintain global [[hierarchies]] and inequality within a region.  As colonial powers control [[local politics]], occurrences of [[domestic violence]] and other forms of gender violence can be observed.  A Western view of domestic violence skews the ability of the population to see that this domestic violence is not simply occurring at the personal level.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2011 /&gt;   
According to Turcotte, there is a common ground between [[petroleum]] production and gender-[[sexual violence]].&lt;ref name=Turcotte2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt; These factors have been used as machines of war and the framework for [[nation building]].  Justification of sexual violence in times of war allows for the mutual existence of the [[Sovereign state|state]] and petroleum industry.  The state's growth is fueled solely by the growth of the [[petroleum industry]] in the region, thus leading to the existence of petro-sexual politics.

==Niger Delta==

[[Transnational feminism|Transnational]] and [[African feminism]] argues that the [[nation-state]] relies upon [[capitalist]] and colonial violence.&lt;ref name=Mudimbe&gt;{{cite book|last=Mudimbe|first=V|title=The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge|year=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-20468-4|pages=1–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The production of petroleum in the [[Niger Delta]] is a direct result of colonial endeavors.  This colonization has directly imposed social arrangements and altered the pre-colonial population, creating a new population under colonial-imperial regulation.&lt;ref name=Mudimbe /&gt; According to Turcotte, gender violence, a precursor to [[colonization]], was vital to colonization itself.  The United Kingdom, controlling oil production in the area, was able to impose imperial rule onto the colony.  Once [[Nigeria]] gained its independence in 1960, colonial ideals were still held in place.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2011 /&gt;
[[File:STS61C-42-72.jpg|left|thumbnail|The Niger Delta as viewed from space]]

===Biafran War===
{{Main|Nigerian Civil War}}

While the Nigerian Civil War (also known as the Biafran War) is often thought of as a [[civil war]], the colonial roots that caused much of the tension leading to the conflict cannot be ignored.  Scholars have suggested that this conflict illustrates the link between gender violence and petroleum. Emecheta depicts a war in which sexual violence was used as a tactic of regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emecheta|first=Buchi|title=Destination Biafra|year=1988|publisher=Heinemann|location=Stockholm|isbn=978-0435909925|pages=1–256|translator-first=Olof|translator-last=Hoffsten}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These regulations shared a direct correlation to the protection of local oil investments.  Through this example, the Nigerian Civil War can be seen as a moment when sexual violence was ultimately utilized to protect the oil industry and is a prime example of petro-sexual political actions.

===Legitimate violence and transnational justice===

The Niger Delta was considered a [[terrorist]] region in 2000 by the United States State Department.  Following this declaration, [[US military]] funding to the region greatly increased to protect off-shore extraction and production of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gerson|first=Joseph|title=U.S. foreign military bases &amp; military colonialism|url=http://www.zcommunications.org/u-s-foreign-military-bases-and-military-colonialism-by-joseph-gerson|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531231151/http://www.zcommunications.org/u-s-foreign-military-bases-and-military-colonialism-by-joseph-gerson|deadurl=unfit|publisher=ZNet|archivedate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action has raised questions of whether or not the U.S. intended to eradicate the terrorist threats or simply protect its oil investments. Turcotte suggests that this [[Conflict in the Niger Delta|violence in the Niger Delta region]] is brought about by the promotion of capitalist democracy through interstate systems.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt;
In the 1990s, the discourse around conflict in the Delta increasing focus on male youth groups activity against the industry as "militant attacks"; by 2000, these men were translated into terrorists by the interstate system.  The history of protests in Nigeria suggests that petro-protest developed from strategies of community justice within women's organizations often supported by male youth groups.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt;

===Petroleum extraction and violence===

According to Watts, oil has seven properties that aid in the explanation as to why violence is often found in areas of [[petroleum extraction]].&lt;ref name=Watts&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=Michael J.|title=Violent Environments|chapter=Petro-violence: community, extraction, and political ecology of a mythic commodity|year=2001|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|pages=189–212|editor1-first=Nancy Lee|editor1-last=Peluso|editor2-first=Michael J.|editor2-last=Watts|isbn=978-0801487118}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Oil is money:  As a source of immediate wealth, the value of oil brings about an ambition and weakening of moral fiber that has been called the élan vital, vital force, of growth.
# Petro-State and Nation:  The presence of oil in a nation creates power within a state.  This power leads to the segregation of who will and will not have access to the resource and the revenue it generates in global markets.
# Petro-imperialism:  When oil is discovered, world powers become involved instantly.  A deal is soon formed between the oil nation and an imperial power.  This deal greatly hinders the oil nation's autonomy.
# Evacuative extraction: The extraction of oil leads to a variety of movement.  The oil flows from the land, but ecological repercussions and the relocation of indigenous populations are also observed.
# Hyper-centralization: The state becomes fully dependent on its oil commodity.  Political endeavors become intertwined with the business aspect of oil- petro-politics.
# The El Dorado effect:  The idea that oil leads to wealth without effort.  Oil and the revenue it will generate will propel the nation or state into the future.  Disregard of values and morals previously seen as vital are stereotypical.
# Valorization of territory:  Debate over who controls how the commodity of oil will be handled.  Disputes are often concerning issues of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], rights and [[citizenship]]. 
In the instance of the Niger Delta, constant exploitation from international oil companies distorted the pre-colonial views of the region.  This distortion has led to violence in the region.  Over 2,000 deaths have occurred as a direct result of this episode.&lt;ref name=Watts /&gt;

===Non-violent forms of activism===

"Blood may be thicker than water, but oil is thicker than both." —Perry Anderson, "Scurrying toward Bethlehem"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Perry|title=Scurrying towards Bethlehem|url=https://newleftreview.org/II/10/perry-anderson-scurrying-towards-bethlehem|journal=New Left Review|volume=10|date=July–August 2001|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to colonial institutions, females headed the Nigerian villages.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt;  Nigerian women were leaders of the palm oil industry that dominated the region prior to the conversion to petroleum.  Due to the fact that these women were seen as reproducers and heads of the family, if instance of abuse were seen, the women could threaten to leave.&lt;ref name=Turcotte2008 /&gt; However, once [[petroleum]] was taken as the region's main resource, the women rapidly lost this power.
Hanna exemplifies different types of protests commonly utilized by Nigerian women: dance, song and nakedness.&lt;ref name=Hanna&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=J|title=Dance, Protest, and Women's Wars: cases from Nigeria and the US|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195065176|editor=Guida West and Rhoda Blumberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Women's protests consist of storming en masse into the compounds of offending men and holding a man 'hostage' by dancing, singing and threatening their nakedness on him."&lt;ref name=Hanna /&gt;
Women's protest during the colonial era has been numerous given their social status prior to colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mba|first=N|title=Nigerian women mobilized|year=1982|publisher=University of California|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0877251484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with these protests, violence against women persisted as global oil initiatives grew in the region. The increasing oil economy of the Delta not only affected the physical well-being of the women in the area, but also affected their livelihoods. Local fishing industries and food staples have all been compromised due to oil-related pollution.&lt;ref name=Patch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patch|first=J.|title=Women and non-violent forms of activism in the Niger Delta oil resource conflict|journal=Undercurrent|year=2008|volume=5|issue=3|pages=39–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As instances of female-led non-violent protests increase, so does militant-based political activism among the male populace.  The variance in protest from violent and non-violent actions has called the legitimacy of the protests into question.  Ultimately, imperial labeling of these protests as "[[terrorist activities]]" perpetuates the existence of the oil companies and regional violence that accompanies the oil industry's presence.&lt;ref name=Patch /&gt;

It seems that these non-violent protests led by community women's organizations have been the most successful in bringing about awareness of the issue to the [[United Nations|UN]] and other [[grass-roots]] organizations.  Through continued use of non-violent protests, the women of the region have been able to establish credibility to their claims that had been previously disregarded as a result of violence and counter-violence in the area.&lt;ref name=Patch /&gt;

===MEND: violent protests of petro-sexual politics===

One source of violent protest to the petro-sexual politics that currently hold the Niger Delta under imperial power lies with the [[Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta]] (MEND). The militant group is driven to violent protests by pollution, marginalization and political repression.&lt;ref name=Courson&gt;{{cite book|last=Courson|first=E|title=Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND)|year=2009|publisher=Nordiska Afrikainstitutet|location=Uppsala|isbn=978-91-7106-657-2|pages=1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As previously noted, the violence in the region between militant groups such as MEND and the government-controlled military can be attributed to [[economic inequality]], the legacy of colonialism, and the lack of a [[democratic government]]. Courson also notes that the gap in wealth in the Niger Delta has grown significantly since foreign oil companies have impacted the region.&lt;ref name=Courson /&gt; MEND emerged onto the resistance scene late in 2005 after attacking two Shell pipelines.  From the beginning, MEND attempted to make its intentions clear; it did not want to combat the people of the region or the oil companies, but the oppressive economy that held the people of the Delta in poverty.  To gain media attention, MEND took two western nationals hostage.  However, the retaliation by the government was not what the MEND resistance had hoped.  An increase in military presence led to human rights abuse, rape, and the destruction of communities, all in the name of fighting MEND, which has earned the title "terrorist" by the [[Nigerian government]]. However, Bushra states that labeling resistance efforts as terrorist acts does not look far enough into the reasons why groups such as MEND have been forced to take up arms.&lt;ref name=Bushra&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bushra|first=S.|title=Nigeria wages war for its own oil|journal=The Stanford Progressive|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bushra continues in saying that MEND's response was necessary due to the fact that previous peace negotiations had failed.&lt;ref name=Bushra /&gt;

Throughout this conflict, MEND has called for international intervention and refutes the terrorist tags that they have been labeled with, saying they fight for survival and equality.&lt;ref name=Courson /&gt; Individuals such as Brusha and Courson believe that military retaliation is not the answer to the problems that petro-sexual politics have imposed on the region. Further violence will lead to additional implications facing the marginalized women and youth that have been objectified as vessels of war in this conflict.&lt;ref name=Courson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bushra /&gt;

In [[international law]] three categories of '''Political status''' are usually recognized:

#Independent countries e.g.: [[France]], [[Canada]] 
#Internal independent countries which are under the protection of another country in matters of defense and foreign affairs, e.g.: [[Netherlands Antilles]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[British Virgin Islands]] etc.
#[[Colony|Colonies]] and other dependent political units e.g. [[Puerto Rico]].

There are, furthermore, several unrecognized countries and independence, secessionist, autonomy and nationalist movements throughout the world. See [[list of unrecognized countries]].

{{History of Bangladesh}}

The '''Provisional Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh''' was established following the [[Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]] of [[East Pakistan]] on 10 April 1971. It was the supreme leadership of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladeshi liberation movement]]. It included the first [[cabinet of Bangladesh]]; the nascent Bangladeshi [[diplomatic corps]]; the [[Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh]]; the [[Mukti Bahini]] military, paramilitary and guerrilla forces; and the [[Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra|Independent Bangladesh Radio]].

The provisional government was formed in the town of [[Mujibnagar]] (formerly Baidyanathtala). Its [[government in exile|capital in exile]] was [[Calcutta]], the capital of the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] and the former capital of [[British India]], which hosted thousands of Bangladeshi refugees escaping the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|1971 genocide]]. The provisional government included many defectors from the Pakistani government, foreign service and military; as well as leading intellectuals and cultural figures from East Pakistan. Its chief executive was [[Tajuddin Ahmad]], the first Bangladeshi Prime Minister.

A worldwide campaign was undertaken by the Provisional Government to garner support for Bangladesh's independence, genocide victims and refugees. It appointed [[special envoy]]s and operated representative missions in New Delhi, Washington D.C. and London among many other cities.

==Formation==
The provisional government was established in the town on Baidyanathtala in [[Meherpur District|Meherpur]], [[Kushtia District]]. Its leaders were administered their oaths at a mango orchard near the site of the [[Battle of Plassey]], in which the British defeated the last independent [[Nawab of Bengal]] in 1757.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/op-ed/genesis-bangladeshs-constitution-1209718|title=Genesis of Bangladesh's Constitution|website=The Daily Star|access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Provisional Government of BD (2).jpg|thumb|Sculpture of Provisional Government of Bangladesh]]

==Constitution==
The legal basis of the Bangladeshi provisional government was provided by the proclamation of independence issued on 10 April 1971, which served as the interim constitution of Bangladesh until 1972. It declared that [[Pakistan]] failed to convene its [[National Assembly of Pakistan|elected representatives]] for framing a new constitution on 3 March 1971; and instead launched an "unjust and treacherous war", a reference to the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.docstrangelove.com/uploads/1971/sbbk/documents/Proclamation%201971_M_Dalil_Vol_03_MMR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], described as the undisputed leader of the 75 million people of East Pakistan, fulfilled aspirations for [[self-determination]] by declaring Bangladesh's independence on 26 March 1971.

The proclamation declared Bangladesh as a [[People's Republic]] with [[Equality before the law|equality]], [[human dignity]] and [[social justice]] as its fundamental principles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Parliament==
The interim constitution converted elected Bengali members of Pakistan's national and provincial assemblies into members of the [[Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh]].

==Armed forces==
The military wing of the provisional government was the [[Mukti Bahini]]. The Bangladeshi liberation guerrillas were based in camps on the East Pakistan-India border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bass |first=Gary J. |date=2013 |title=The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger, and a Forgotten Genocide |publisher=Alfred A.

==Bureaucracy==
Many Bengali members of the [[Civil Service of Pakistan]] defected to the government of Bangladesh. Dr. [[Kamal Uddin Siddiqui]], Nurul Kader Khan, S. A. Samad, Khondker Asaduzzaman, Dr. Sa'dat Hussain and Dr. [[Akbar Ali Khan (economist)|Akbar Ali Khan]] were early leaders of the newly formed [[Bangladesh Civil Service]]. The provisional government established an elaborate structure of administrative departments. Yusuf Ali and J. G. Bhowmik served as the chief Relief Commissioners for Bangladeshi refugees. The noted artist [[Quamrul Hassan]] served as Director of Art and Design. Calcutta and [[Agartala]] were the main centres of the government-in-exile.

[[Image:Aqua-distillata.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bottle]] for distilled water in the [[Royal Academy of Pharmacy|Royal Academy of Pharmacy (Spain)]]]]
'''Purified water''' is [[water]] that has been mechanically filtered or processed to remove impurities and make it suitable for use. [[Distilled water]] has been the most common form of purified water, but, in recent years, water is more frequently purified by other processes including [[capacitive deionization]], [[reverse osmosis]], [[carbon filtering]], [[microfiltration]], [[ultrafiltration]], [[ultraviolet]] [[oxidation]], or [[electrodeionization]]. Combinations of a number of these processes have come into use to produce [[ultrapure water]] of such high purity that its trace contaminants are measured in parts per billion (ppb) or parts per trillion (ppt). Purified water has many uses, largely in the production of medications, in science and engineering laboratories and industries, and is produced in a range of purities. It can be produced on site for immediate use or purchased in containers. Purified water in colloquial English can also refer to water which has been treated ("rendered potable") to neutralize, but not necessarily remove contaminants considered harmful to humans or animals.

==Parameters of water purity==

Purified water is usually produced by the purification of [[drinking water]] or [[ground water]]. The impurities that may need to be removed are:
*inorganic ions (typically monitored as electrical conductivity or resistivity or specific tests)
*organic compounds (typically monitored as TOC or by specific tests)
*bacteria (monitored by total viable counts or [[epifluorescence]])
*endotoxins and nucleases (monitored by [[limulus amebocyte lysate|LAL]] or specific enzyme tests)
*particulates (typically controlled by filtration)
*gases (typically managed by degassing when required)

==Purification methods==

===Distillation===

Distilled water is produced by a process of [[distillation]] and has an [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|electrical conductivity]] of not more than 11 [[Micro-|µ]][[Siemens (unit)|S]]/cm and total dissolved solids of less than 10&amp;nbsp;mg/litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/facts-faits/faqs_bottle_water-eau_embouteillee-eng.php|title= Frequently asked questions about bottled water|accessdate=2009-05-24|publisher= Health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distillation involves [[boiling]] the water and then condensing the [[vapor]] into a clean container, leaving solid contaminants behind. Distillation produces very pure water. A white or yellowish mineral scale is left in the distillation apparatus, which requires regular cleaning. Distilled water, like all purified water, must be stored in a sterilized container to guarantee the absence of bacteria. For many procedures, more economical alternatives are available, such as deionized water, and are used in place of distilled water.

===Double distillation===
Double-distilled water (abbreviated "ddH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O", "Bidest. water" or "DDW") is prepared by slow boiling the uncontaminated condensed water vapor from a prior slow boiling. Historically, it was the de facto standard for highly purified laboratory water for [[biochemistry]] and used in laboratory trace analysis until combination purification methods of water purification became widespread.

===Deionization===
[[File:Cation anion ion exchange.jpg|thumb|Large cation/anion [[ion exchange]]rs used in demineralization of [[boiler feedwater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mischissin|first1=Stephen G.|title=University of Rochester - Investigation of Steam Turbine Extraction Line Failures|url=http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2012-Campus-Arlington/Presentations/Wednesday-A/9A2MISCHISSINUniv-Rochester-2012-IDEA-Presentation.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2015|location=Arlington, VA|pages=25–26|date=7 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923215229/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2012-Campus-Arlington/Presentations/Wednesday-A/9A2MISCHISSINUniv-Rochester-2012-IDEA-Presentation.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Deionized water (''DI water'', ''DIW'' or ''de-ionized water''), often synonymous with ''demineralized water / DM water'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.image2output.com/deionised-water-25l.html|title=Deionised Water 25L|publisher=Image2output.com|date=2008-12-21|accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[water]] that has had almost all of its mineral ions removed, such as [[cation]]s like [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[iron]], and [[copper]], and [[anion]]s such as [[chloride]] and [[sulfate]]. Deionization is a chemical process that uses specially manufactured [[ion-exchange resin]]s, which exchange hydrogen and hydroxide ions for dissolved minerals, and then recombine to form water. Because most non-particulate water impurities are dissolved salts, deionization produces highly pure water that is generally similar to distilled water, with the advantage that the process is quicker and does not build up scale. However, deionization does not significantly remove uncharged organic molecules, viruses or bacteria, except by incidental trapping in the resin. Specially made strong base anion resins can remove [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. Deionization can be done continuously and inexpensively using [[electrodeionization]].

Three types of deionization exist: co-current, counter-current, and mixed bed.

====Co-current deionization====
Co-current deionization refers to the original downflow process where both input water and regeneration chemicals enter at the top of an ion exchange column and exit at the bottom. Co-current operating costs are comparatively higher than counter-current deionization because of the additional usage of regenerants. Because regenerant chemicals are dilute when they encounter the bottom or finishing resins in an ion exchange column, the product quality is lower than a similarly sized counter-flow column.

The process is still used, and can be maximized with the fine tuning of the flow of regenerants within the ion exchange column.

====Counter-current deionization====
Counter-current deionization comes in two forms, each requiring engineered internals:
#Upflow columns where input water enters from the bottom and regenerants enter from the top of the ion exchange column.
#Upflow regeneration where water enters from the top and regenerants enter from the bottom.

In both cases, separate distribution headers (input water, input regenerant, exit water, and exit regenerant) must be tuned to: the input water quality and flow, the time of operation between regenerations, and the desired product water analysis.

Counter-current deionization is the more attractive method of ion exchange. Chemicals (regenerants) flow in the opposite direction to the service flow. Less time for regeneration is required when compared to cocurrent columns. The quality of the finished product can be as low as .5 parts per million. The main advantage of counter-current deionization is the low operating cost, due to a low usage of regenerants during the regeneration process.

====Mixed bed deionization====
Mixed bed deionization is a 50/50 mixture of cation and anion resin combined in a single ion exchange column. With proper pretreatment, product water purified from a single pass through a mixed bed ion exchange column is the purest that can be made. Most commonly, mixed bed demineralizers are used for final water polishing to clean the last few ions within water prior to use. Small mixed bed deionization units have no regeneration capability. Commercial mixed bed deionization units have elaborate internal water and regenerant distribution systems for regeneration. A control system operates pumps and valves for the regenerants of spent anions and cations resins within the ion exchange column. Each is regenerated separately, then remixed during the regeneration process. Because of the high quality of product water achieved, and because of the expense and difficulty of regeneration, mixed bed demineralizers are used only when the highest purity water is required.

===Demineralization===
Demineralization is often a term used interchangeably with deionization. Demineralization is essentially removing all the minerals that can be found in natural water. This process is usually done when the water will be used for chemical processes and the minerals present may interfere with the other chemicals. All chemistic and beauty products have to be made with demineralized water for this reason. With the demineralization process, the water is "softened" replacing the undesired minerals with different salts (NaCl). Demineralized water has a higher conductivity than deionized water.

===Other processes===
Other processes are also used to purify water, including [[reverse osmosis]], [[carbon filtration]], microporous filtration, [[ultrafiltration]], ultraviolet oxidation, or electrodialysis. These are used in place of, or in addition to, the processes listed above. Processes rendering water potable but not necessarily closer to being pure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O / [[hydroxide]] + [[hydronium]] ions include the use of dilute [[bleach|sodium hypochlorite]], ozone, mixed-oxidants (electro-catalyzed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + NaCl), and iodine; See discussion regarding potable water treatments under "Health effects" below.

==Uses==
Purified water is suitable for many applications, including autoclaves, hand-pieces, laboratory testing, laser cutting, and automotive use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pureklenz.com|title=Purified Water and Clinical Products|publisher=Pure Klenz|date= |accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purification removes contaminants that may interfere with processes, or leave residues on evaporation. Although water is generally considered to be a good electrical conductor&amp;mdash;for example domestic electrical systems are considered particularly hazardous to people if they may be in contact with wet surfaces&amp;mdash;''pure'' water is a poor conductor. The conductivity of sea-water is typically 5 S/m,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/water-conductivity.htm|title=Water conductivity|publisher=Lenntech|date= |accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; drinking water is typically in the range of 5-50 mS/m, while highly purified water can be as low as 5.5 μS/m (0.055 µS/cm), a [[ratio]] of about 1,000,000:1,000:1.

Purified water is used in the pharmaceutical industry. Water of this grade is widely used as a raw material, ingredient, and solvent in the processing, formulation, and manufacture of pharmaceutical products, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and intermediates, compendial articles, and analytical reagents. The microbiological content of the water is of importance and the water must be regularly monitored and tested to show that it remains within microbiological control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sandle, T. |title=An approach for the reporting of microbiological results from water systems|journal=PDA J Pharm Sci Technol |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=231–7|date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purified water is also used in the commercial beverage industry as the primary ingredient of any given trademarked bottling formula, in order to maintain critical consistency of taste, clarity, and color. This guarantees the consumer complete reliability of safety and drinking-satisfaction of their favorite refreshment, no matter where in the world it has been bottled. In the process prior to filling and sealing, individual bottles are always rinsed with deionised water to remove any particles that could cause a change in taste.

Deionised and Distilled water are used in lead-acid batteries to prevent erosion of the cells, although Deionised water is the better choice as more impurities are removed from the water in the creation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fortisbattery.com/latest/2015/12/what-is-deionised-water-fortis-battery-care/|title=What is Deionised Water? {{!}} Fortis Battery Care|website=Your Forklift Battery System Sorted {{!}} Fortis Battery Care|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory use===
[[Technical standard]]s on water quality have been established by a number of professional organizations, including the [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS), [[ASTM International]], the U.S. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) which is now [[Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute|CLSI]], and the [[United States Pharmacopeia|U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP)]]. The ASTM, NCCLS, and ISO 3696 or the [[International Organization for Standardization]] classify purified water into Grade 1–3 or Types I–IV depending on the level of purity. These organizations have similar, although not identical, parameters for highly purified water.

Note that the European Pharmacopeia uses Highly Purified Water (HPW) as a definition for water meeting the quality of Water For Injection, without however having undergone distillation. In the laboratory context, highly purified water is used to denominate various qualities of water having been "highly" purified.

Regardless of which organization's water quality norm is used, even Type I water may require further purification depending on the specific laboratory application. For example, water that is being used for molecular-biology experiments needs to be [[DNase]] or [[RNase]]-free, which requires special additional treatment or functional testing. Water for microbiology experiments needs to be completely sterile, which is usually accomplished by autoclaving. Water used to analyze trace metals may require the elimination of trace metals to a standard beyond that of the Type I water norm.

====Criticism====
A member of the ASTM D19 (Water) Committee, Erich L. Gibbs, criticized ASTM Standard D1193, by saying "Type I water could be almost anything – water that meets some or all of the limits, part or all of the time, at the same or different points in the production process."&lt;ref name="gibbs"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Critique of ASTM Standard D1193|url=http://www.readbag.com/high-q-pdf-astm-d1193-critique}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrical conductivity====
The [[electrical conductivity]] &lt;!--Linked from "Electrodeionization" --&gt;of ultra-pure water is 5.5&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; S/m (18 MΩ·cm in the reciprocal terms of electrical resistivity) and is due only to H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions produced in the water dissociation equilibrium.&lt;ref name=JPhysChemB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labmanager.com/?articles.view/articleNo/3673/], Resistivity / Conductivity Measurement of Purified Water, Lab Manager Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; This low conductivity is only achieved, however, in the presence of dissolved monatomic gases. Completely de-gassed ultrapure water has a conductivity of 1.2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; S/m, whereas on equilibration to the atmosphere it is 7.5&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; S/m due to dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in it.&lt;ref name=JPhysChemB&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jp045975a|title=De-Gassed Water Is a Better Cleaning Agent|journal=J. Phys. Chem. B|year=2005|volume=109|pages=1231–1238|first1=R. M.|last1=Pashley|first2=M.|last2=Rzechowicz|first3=L. R.|last3=Pashley|first4=M. J.|last4=Francis|issue=3|pmid=16851085}} See in particular page 1235. Note that values in this paper are given in S/cm, not S/m, which differs by a factor of 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest grades of ultrapure water should not be stored in glass or plastic containers because these container materials leach (release) contaminants at very low concentrations. Storage vessels made of [[silica]] are used for less-demanding applications and vessels of ultrapure [[tin]] are used for the highest-purity applications. It is worth noting that, although electrical conductivity only indicates the presence of ions, the majority of common contaminants found naturally in water ionize to some degree. This ionization is a good measure of the efficacy of a filtration system, and more expensive systems incorporate conductivity-based alarms to indicate when filters should be refreshed or replaced. For comparison,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100127024904/http://waterfacts.net/html/conductivity.html Conductivity]&lt;/ref&gt; sea water has a conductivity of perhaps 5 S/m (53 mS/cm is quoted), while normal un-purified tap water may have conductivity of 5 mS/m (50 μS/cm) (to within an order of magnitude), which is still about 2 or 3 orders of magnitude higher than the output from a well-functioning demineralizing or distillation mechanism, so low levels of contamination or declining performance are easily detected.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Industrial uses===
Some industrial processes, notably in the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries, need large amounts of very pure water. In these situations, feedwater is first processed into purified water and then further processed to produce [[ultrapure water]].

===Other uses===
Distilled or deionized water is commonly used to top up the [[lead-acid batteries]] used in cars and trucks and for other applications. The presence of foreign ions commonly found in tap water will drastically shorten the lifespan of a lead-acid battery.

Distilled or deionized water is preferable to tap water for use in automotive cooling systems.

Using deionised or distilled water in appliances that evaporate water, such as [[steam iron]]s and humidifiers, can reduce the build-up of mineral [[Limescale|scale]], which shortens appliance life. Some appliance manufacturers say that deionised water is no longer necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumersearch.com/steam-irons/important-features|title=How to Buy a Steam Iron|publisher=Consumersearch.com|date= |accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeinstitute.com/steam-iron-buying-guide.htm|title=Steam Iron Buying Guide|publisher=Homeinstitute.com|date= |accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purified water is used in freshwater and marine [[aquarium]]s. Since it does not contain impurities such as copper and chlorine, it helps to keep fish free from diseases, and avoids the build-up of algae on aquarium plants due to its lack of phosphate and silicate. Deionized water should be re-mineralized before use in aquaria, since it lacks many macro- and micro-nutrients needed by plants and fish.

Water (sometimes mixed with [[methanol]]) has been used to extend the performance of aircraft engines. In piston engines, it acts to delay the onset of [[engine knocking]]. In turbine engines, it allows more fuel flow for a given turbine temperature limit, and increases mass flow. As an example, it was used on early [[Boeing 707]] models.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/ch7.htm SP-4221 The Space Shuttle Decision] Retrieved 25 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced materials and engineering have since rendered such systems obsolete for new designs; however, spray-cooling of incoming air-charge is still used to a limited extent with off-road turbo-charged engines (road-race track cars).

Deionized water is very often used as an "ingredient" in many cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, where it is sometimes referred to as "aqua" on product ingredient labels; see [[International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients]].

Because of its high relative [[dielectric constant]] (~80), deionized water is also used (for short durations, when the resistive losses are acceptable) as a high voltage dielectric in many [[pulsed power]] applications, such as the [[Sandia National Laboratories]] [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z Machine]].

Distilled water can be used in PC watercooling systems and Laser Marking Systems. The lack of impurity in the water means that the system stays clean and prevents a buildup of bacteria and algae. Also, the low conductance reduces the risk of electrical damage in the event of a leak.

When used as a rinse after washing cars, windows, and similar applications, purified water dries without leaving spots caused by dissolved solutes.

Deionized water is used in water-fog fire-extinguishing systems used in sensitive environments, such as where high-voltage electrical and sensitive electronic equipment is used. The 'sprinkler' nozzles use much finer spray jets than other systems, and operate at up 35 MPa (350 bar; 5,000 psi) of pressure. The extremely fine mist produced takes the heat out of a fire rapidly, and the fine droplets of water are nonconducting (when deionized) and are less likely to damage sensitive equipment. Deionized water, however, is inherently acidic and contaminants (such as copper, dust, stainless and carbon steel, and many other common materials) rapidly supply ions, thus re-ionizing the water. It is not generally considered acceptable to spray water on electrical circuits that are powered, and it is generally considered undesirable to use water in electrical contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmasc.com/cleaning_chemicals.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306164147/http://www.tmasc.com/cleaning_chemicals.htm |date=March 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hghouston.com/Technical%20FAQs/TFAQ021.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019233111/http://www.hghouston.com/Technical%20FAQs/TFAQ021.html |date=October 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safetymgmt.com/AIGRiskTools/Knowledge_Center/General_Industry/ELECTRICAL_SAFETY.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208123903/http://www.safetymgmt.com/AIGRiskTools/Knowledge_Center/General_Industry/ELECTRICAL_SAFETY.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 8, 2018 |accessdate=March 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distilled or purified water is used in [[humidor]]s to prevent [[cigar]]s from collecting [[bacteria]], [[mold]], and contaminants, as well as to prevent residue from forming on the [[humidifier]] material.

Window cleaners using water-fed pole systems also use purified water because it enables the windows to dry by themselves leaving no stains or smears. The use of purified water from water-fed poles also prevents the need for using ladders and therefore ensure compliance with Work at Height Legislation in the UK.

==Health effects of drinking purified water==
Distillation removes all minerals from water, and the [[Membrane technology|membrane methods]] of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most, or virtually all, minerals. This results in demineralized water, which has not been proven to be healthier than [[drinking water]]. The World Health Organization investigated the health effects of demineralized water in 1980, and its experiments in humans found that demineralized water increased [[diuresis]] and the elimination of [[electrolyte]]s, with decreased serum potassium concentration. Magnesium, calcium and other nutrients in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10&amp;nbsp;mg/L with 20–30&amp;nbsp;mg/L optimum; for calcium a 20&amp;nbsp;mg/L minimum and a 40–80&amp;nbsp;mg/L optimum, and a total water hardness (adding magnesium and calcium) of 2–4&amp;nbsp;[[mmol/L]]. At water hardness above 5&amp;nbsp;mmol/L, higher incidences of gallstones, kidney stones, urinary stones, arthrosis, and arthropathies have been observed. For fluoride, the concentration recommended for dental health is 0.5–1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L, with a maximum guideline value of 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/L to avoid [[dental fluorosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Nutrients in Drinking Water|isbn=92-4-159398-9|publisher=World Health Organization|author=Kozisek F|chapter=Health risks from drinking demineralised water|year=2005|pages=148–63|chapterurl=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water filtration devices are becoming increasingly common in households. Most of these devices do not distill water, though there continues to be an increase in consumer-oriented water distillers and [[reverse osmosis]] machines being sold and used. Municipal water supplies often add or have trace impurities at levels that are regulated to be safe for consumption. Much of these additional impurities, such as [[volatile organic compounds]], [[fluoride]], and an estimated 75,000+ other chemical compounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watersystems.walton.com/|title=Walton International - Home|publisher=Watersystems.walton.com|date=2010-11-05|accessdate=2011-12-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904210320/http://watersystems.walton.com/|archivedate=2014-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drinkmorewater.com/technology/technology/|title=Our Technology - Purification Technology|publisher=Drinkmorewater.com|date=|accessdate=2011-12-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106170706/http://www.drinkmorewater.com/technology/technology/|archivedate=2012-01-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010207205656/http://www.homeenvironmentcenter.com/10stage.htm Technical Information - HEC-3000 10-Step Water Purification System]&lt;/ref&gt; are not removed through conventional filtration; however, distillation and reverse osmosis eliminate nearly all of these impurities.

The drinking of purified water as a replacement of drinking water has been both advocated and discouraged for health reasons. Purified water lacks minerals and ions such as calcium that play key roles in biological functions, such as in nervous system [[homeostasis]], and are normally found in potable water. The lack of naturally occurring minerals in distilled water has raised some concerns. The Journal of General Internal Medicine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Azoulay A, Garzon P, Eisenberg MJ |year=2001|title=Comparison of the mineral content of tap water and bottled waters|journal=J Gen Intern Med|volume=16 |issue=3|pages=168–75|pmid=11318912|pmc=1495189|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2001.04189.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a study on the mineral contents of different waters available in the US. The study found that "drinking water sources available to North Americans may contain high levels of [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], and [[sodium]] and may provide clinically important portions of the recommended dietary intake of these minerals". It encouraged people to "check the mineral content of their drinking water, whether tap or bottled, and choose water most appropriate for their needs". Since distilled water is devoid of minerals, supplemental mineral intake through diet is needed to maintain proper health.

The consumption of [[hard water|"hard" water]] (water with minerals) is associated with beneficial cardiovascular effects. As noted in the American Journal of Epidemiology, the consumption of hard drinking water is negatively correlated with atherosclerotic [[heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Voors|first=A.

'''Right-wing populism''' is a [[political ideology]] which combines [[right-wing politics]] and [[populism|populist]] rhetoric and themes. The rhetoric often consists of [[anti-elitist]] sentiments, opposition to [[the Establishment]] and speaking for the [[common people]].

In Europe, right-wing populism is an expression used to describe groups, politicians and political parties generally known for their opposition to [[immigration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theconversation.com/the-metapolitical-long-game-of-the-european-new-right-75078|title=The metapolitical long game of the European New Right|last=Sharpe|first=Matthew|work=The Conversation|access-date=24 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly from the [[Islamic world]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-the-geert-wilders-effect-20170313-story.html|title=The Geert Wilders Effect and the national election in the Netherlands|last=Traub|first=James|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=24 March 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in most cases [[Euroscepticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/opinion/sunday/how-the-dutch-stopped-being-decent-and-dull.html|title=How the Dutch Stopped Being Decent and Dull|last=Buruma|first=Ian|date=10 March 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=24 March 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing populism in the [[Western world]] is generally—though not exclusively—associated with ideologies such as [[neo-nationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertylawsite.org/2016/12/08/the-new-nationalism/|title=The New Nationalism|date=8 December 2016|website=Online Library of Law &amp; Liberty|access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/world/europe/a-central-conflict-of-21st-century-politics-who-belongs.html|title=A Central Conflict of 21st-Century Politics: Who Belongs?|last=Taub|first=Amanda|date=8 July 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=24 March 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wuwm.com/post/rise-right-wing-nationalist-political-parties-europe#stream/0|title=The Rise of Right-Wing Nationalist Political Parties in Europe|last=North|first=Bonnie|access-date=24 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/fear-of-diversity-made-people-more-likely-to-vote-trump/|title=Fear of Diversity Made People More Likely to Vote Trump|work=The Nation|access-date=24 March 2017|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-political-lexicon-of-a-billionaire-populist/2017/03/09/4d4c2686-ff86-11e6-8f41-ea6ed597e4ca_story.html|title=The political lexicon of a billionaire populist|website=Washington Post|access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[protectionism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/the-end-of-reaganism-214853|title=The End of Reaganism|work=POLITICO Magazine|access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[opposition to immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fesdc.org/fileadmin/user_upload/publications/RightwingPopulism.pdf|title=The Rise of Right-wing Populism in Europe and the United States|last=Greven|first=Thomas|date=May 2016|website=Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamophobia|Anti-Muslim ideas and sentiments]]  serve as the "great unifiers" among right-wing political formations throughout  Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Bangstad 2018 pp. 285–311"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bangstad | first=Sindre | title=Diversity and Contestations over Nationalism in Europe and Canada | chapter=The New Nationalism and its Relationship to Islam | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK | publication-place=London | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-137-58986-6 | doi=10.1057/978-1-137-58987-3_11 | pages=285–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] views such as opposition to an increasing support for the [[welfare state]] and a "more lavish, but also more restrictive, domestic social spending" scheme is also described under right-wing populism and is sometimes called "[[welfare chauvinism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edsall|first1=Thomas|title=The Rise of ‘Welfare Chauvinism’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/opinion/the-rise-of-welfare-chauvinism.html?_r=0|website=New York Times|accessdate=4 January 2015|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rippon|first1=Haydn|title=The European far right: actually right?

From the 1990s, right-wing populist parties became established in the legislatures of various democracies, including [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Romania]] and [[Sweden]]; and they entered coalition governments in [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Chile]], [[Finland]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]],{{sfn|Norris|2005|p=3}} [[Israel]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Switzerland]]; and majority governments in [[India]], [[Turkey]], [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]]. Although [[extreme right-wing]] movements in the [[United States]] have been studied separately, where they are normally called "[[Radical right (United States)|radical right]]", some writers consider them to be a part of the same phenomenon.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|pp=1–2}} Right-wing populism in the United States is also closely linked to [[paleoconservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/08/26/the-trump-phenomenon-and-the-european-populist-radical-right/|title=The Trump phenomenon and the European populist radical right|website=Washington Post|access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing populism is distinct from [[conservatism]], but several right-wing populist parties have their roots in conservative political parties.{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|pp=10–13}} Other populist parties have links to [[fascist]] movements founded during the [[interwar period]] when [[Italian fascism|Italian]], [[German fascism|German]], [[Hungarian fascism|Hungarian]], [[Spanish fascism|Spanish]] and [[Japanese fascism|Japanese]] fascism rose to power.

==Definition==
Classification of right-wing populism into a single [[Left–right politics#Political parties in the political spectrum|political family]] has proved difficult and it is not certain whether a meaningful category exists, or merely a cluster of categories since the parties differ in ideology, organization and leadership rhetoric. Unlike traditional parties, they also do not belong to international organizations of like-minded parties, and they do not use similar terms to describe themselves.{{sfn|Norris|2005|pp=43–44}}

Scholars use terminology inconsistently, sometimes referring to right-wing populism as "[[radical right (disambiguation)|radical right]]"{{sfn|Kaplan|Weinberg|1998|pp=10–11}} or other terms such as [[Neo-nationalism|new nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/06/25/483400958/from-brexit-to-trump-nationalist-movements-gain-momentum-around-world|title=From 'Brexit' To Trump, Nationalist Movements Gain Momentum Around World|website=NPR.org|access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pippa Norris]] noted that "standard reference works use alternate typologies and diverse labels categorising parties as '[[Far-right politics|far]]' or 'extreme' right, '[[new right]]', '[[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant]]' or '[[Neo-fascism|neofascist]]', '[[Antiestablishmentarianism|antiestablishment]]', '[[national populist]]', 'protest', 'ethnic', '[[authoritarianism|authoritarian]]', '[[Anti-statism|antigovernment]]', 'antiparty', '[[ultranationalist]]', '[[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]]', '[[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]]' and so on".{{sfn|Norris|2005|p=44}}

==By country==
Piero Ignazi divided right-wing populist parties, which he called "extreme right parties", into two categories: he placed traditional right-wing parties that had developed out of the historical right and post-industrial parties that had developed independently. He placed the [[British National Party]], the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]], the [[German People's Union]] and the former Dutch [[Centre Party (Netherlands)|Centre Party]] in the first category, whose prototype would be the disbanded [[Italian Social Movement]]; whereas he placed the French [[National Front (France)|National Front]], the German [[The Republicans (Germany)|Republicans]], the Dutch [[Centre Democrats (Netherlands)|Centre Democrats]], the former Belgian [[Vlaams Blok]] (which would include certain aspects of traditional extreme right parties), the Danish [[Progress Party (Denmark)|Progress Party]], the Norwegian [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] and the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] in the second category.{{sfn|Ignazi|2002|p=26}}&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ideology of the Extreme Right|author=Mudde, C.|date=2002|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719064463|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=spT-NgRm3f8C|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Right-wing populist parties in the English-speaking world include the [[UK Independence Party]] and Australia's [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]].{{sfn|Norris|2005|pp=68–69, 72}} The U.S. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and [[Conservative Party of Canada]] include right-wing populist factions.

===Australia===
[[File:Pauline Hanson at the Kurri Kurri Nostalgia Festival in 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Pauline Hanson]], leader of [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]]]]
The main right-wing populist party in Australia is [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]], led by [[Pauline Hanson]], [[Australian Senate|Senator]] for [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-39111317|title=The rise of populist politics in Australia|date=1 March 2017|work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Nation typically supports the governing [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/pauline-hansons-one-nation-emerges-as-governments-most-reliable-senate-voting-partner-20170304-guqo6i.html|title=Pauline Hanson's One Nation emerges as government's most reliable Senate voting partner|date=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some figures within the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], which is part of the Coalition, have been described as right-wing populists, including former Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|work=Routledge|quote="If ...

===Canada===
Canada has a history of right-wing populist protest parties and politicians, most notably in [[Western Canada]] due to [[Western alienation]]. The highly successful [[Social Credit Party of Canada]] consistently won seats in [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], and [[Saskatchewan]], but fell into obscurity by the 1970s. The [[Reform Party of Canada]] led by [[Preston Manning]] was another very successful right-wing populist formed as a result of the policies of the [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] which alienated many [[Blue Tory|Blue Tories]]. The two parties ultimately merged into the [[Conservative Party of Canada]].

In recent years, right-wing populist elements have existed within the Conservative Party of Canada and mainstream provincial parties, and have most notably been espoused by Ontario MP [[Kellie Leitch]]; businessman [[Kevin O'Leary]]; [[Premier of Quebec|Quebec Premier]] [[François Legault]]; the former [[Mayor of Toronto]], [[Rob Ford]]; and his brother, [[Premier of Ontario|Ontario Premier]] [[Doug Ford Jr.|Doug Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Irresponsible' populism: Lisa Raitt slams Kevin O'Leary, Kellie Leitch|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-leadership-raitt-oleary-leitch-1.3921244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/could-trumpism-take-root-in-canada-59e1af004574#.xkk8hpxea|title=Could Trumpism Take Root in Canada?|date=15 March 2017|work=Pacific Standard|access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dford"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=28 March 2018|title=Patrick Brown returns to Queen’s Park for budget speech|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2018/03/28/patrick-brown-returns-to-queens-park-for-budget-speech.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Economist]]|title=Anti-elitist politicians in Canada are courting immigrants|date=19 April 2018|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21740782-no-reason-liberals-be-complacent-anti-elitist-politicians-canada-are-courting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Austria====
The Austrian [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] (FPÖ) established in 1955 by a former [[Nazi]] functionary claims to represent a "Third Camp" (''Drittes Lager''), beside the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Socialist Party]] and the social Catholic [[Austrian People's Party]]. It succeeded the [[Federation of Independents]] founded after World War II, adopting the pre-war heritage of [[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalism]]. Though it did not gain much popularity for decades, it exercised considerable [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] by supporting several [[Austrian Federal Government|federal governments]], be it right-wing or left-wing, e.g. the Socialist [[Bruno Kreisky|Kreisky]] cabinet of 1970 (see [[Kreisky–Peter–Wiesenthal affair]]).

[[File:GuentherZ 2012-07-03 0158 Wien01 Parlament Hans-Christian Strache.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Heinz-Christian Strache]], leader of the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] and [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria]]]]
From 1980, the Freedom Party adopted a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] stance. Upon the [[Austrian legislative election, 1983|1983 federal election]], it entered a [[coalition government]] with the Socialist Party, whereby party chairman [[Norbert Steger]] served as [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria|Vice-Chancellor]]. The liberal interlude however ended, when [[Jörg Haider]] was elected chairman in 1986. By his down-to-earth manners and [[patriotism|patriotic]] attitude, Haider re-integrated the party's nationalist base voters. Nevertheless, he was also able to obtain votes from large sections of population disenchanted with politics by publicly denouncing corruption and [[nepotism]] of the Austrian ''[[Proporz]]'' system. The electoral success was boosted by Austria's [[1995 enlargement of the European Union|accession to the European Union]] in 1995.

Upon the [[Austrian legislative election, 1999|1999 federal election]], the Freedom Party (FPÖ) with 26.9% of the votes cast became the second strongest party in the [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] parliament. Having entered a coalition government with the People's Party, Haider had to face the disability of several FPÖ ministers, but also the impossibility of agitation against members of his own cabinet. In 2005, he finally countered the FPÖ's loss of reputation by the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZÖ) relaunch in order to carry on his government. The remaining FPÖ members elected [[Heinz-Christian Strache]] chairman, but since the [[Austrian legislative election, 2006|2006 federal election]] both right-wing parties have run separately. After Haider was killed in a car accident in 2008, the BZÖ has lost a measurable amount of support.

The FPÖ regained much of its support in subsequent elections. Its candidate [[Norbert Hofer]] made it into the runoff in the [[Austrian presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], though he narrowly lost the election. After the [[Austrian legislative election, 2017|2017 legislative elections]], the FPÖ formed a [[Kurz government|government coalition]] with the [[Austrian People's Party]].

====Belgium====
[[File:Vlaams Blok Flag.png|thumb|150px|Flag used by the now-defunct [[Vlaams Blok]]]]
[[Vlaams Blok]], established in 1978, operated on a platform of law and order, anti-immigration (with particular focus on Islamic immigration) and secession of the [[Flanders]] region of the country. The secession was originally planned to end in the annexation of Flanders by the culturally and linguistically similar [[Netherlands]] until the plan was abandoned due to the multiculturalism in that country. In the elections to the Flemish Parliament in June 2004, the party received 24.2% of the vote, within less than 2% of being the largest party.&lt;ref name="belgium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polling2004.belgium.be/en/vla/results/results_graph_etop.html|title=Elections 2004 – Flemish Council – List Results|publisher=polling2004.belgium.be|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in November of the same year, the party was ruled illegal under anti-racism law for, among other things, advocating schools segregated between citizens and immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3994867.stm | work=BBC News | title=Court rules Vlaams Blok is racist | date=9 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In less than a week, the party was re-established under the name [[Vlaams Belang]], with a near-identical ideology.

====Cyprus====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
The [[ELAM (Cyprus)|ELAM]] (National People's Front) ([[Εθνικό Λαϊκό Μέτωπο]]) was formed in 2008 on the platform of maintaining Cypriot identity, opposition to further European integration, immigration and the ''status quo'' that remains due to Turkey's invasion of a third of the island (and the international community's lack of intention to solve the issue).

The Danish People's Party advocates immigration reductions, particularly from non-Western countries, favor cultural assimilation of first generation migrants into Danish society and are opposed to Denmark becoming a multicultural society.

In France, the main right-wing populist party is the [[National Front (France)|National Front]]. Since [[Marine Le Pen]]'s election at the head of the party in 2011, the National Front has established itself as one of the main political parties in France and also as the strongest and most successful populist party of Europe as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2638965/Massive-victory-French-far-right-National-Front-record-quarter-vote-Euro-elections.html|title='A grave moment for France': National Front sweeps to victory in Paris leaving Socialist government fighting for life – and in Germany a neo-Nazi is elected for first time in decades|date=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Pen finished second in the [[French presidential election, 2017|2017 election]] and lost in the second round of voting versus [[Emmanuel Macron]] which was held on 7 May 2017.

The [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2018]] result was a victory for the [[Fidesz]]–[[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|KDNP]] alliance, preserving its two-thirds majority, with [[Viktor Orbán]] remaining Prime Minister. Orbán and Fidesz campaigned primarily on the issues of immigration and foreign meddling, and the election was seen as a victory for right-wing populism in Europe.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

====Germany====
[[File:Alternative-fuer-Deutschland-Logo-2013.svg|thumb|left|The [[Alternative for Germany]] is a political party that was founded in 2013 and is now led by [[Jörg Meuthen]] and [[Alexander Gauland]], being Germany's leading right-wing populist party]]
Since 2013, the most popular right-wing populist party in Germany has been [[Alternative for Germany]] which managed to finish third in the [[German federal election, 2017|2017 German federal election]], making it the first right-wing populist party to enter the [[Bundestag]], Germany's national parliament. Before, right-wing populist parties had gained seats in [[Composition of the German State Parliaments|German State Parliaments]] only. [[Left-wing populism]] is represented in the Bundestag by [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] party.

On a regional level, right-wing populist movements like [[Pro NRW]] and [[Citizens in Rage]] (''Bürger in Wut'', BIW) sporadically attract some support. In 1989, [[The Republicans (Germany)|The Republicans]] (''Die Republikaner'') led by [[Franz Schönhuber]] entered the [[Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin]] and achieved more than 7% of the German votes cast in the [[European Parliament election, 1989 (West Germany)|1989 European election]], with six seats in the European Parliament. The party also won seats in the [[Landtag of Baden-Württemberg]] twice in 1992 and 1996, but after 2000 the Republicans' support eroded in favour of the far-right [[German People's Union]] and the [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD), which in the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 federal election]] held 1.5% of the popular vote (winning up to 9% in regional ''[[Landtag]]'' parliamentary elections).

In 2005, a nationwide [[Pro Germany Citizens' Movement]] (''pro Deutschland'') was founded in [[Cologne]]. The Pro Germany movement appears as a conglomerate of numerous small parties, voters' associations and societies, distinguishing themselves by campaigns against [[Islamic extremism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-right-wing-populists-provoke-salafist-violence-in-bonn-a-831810.html|title=Salafists and Right-Wing Populists Battle in Bonn|publisher=[[Spiegel (magazine)|Spiegel]]|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muslim]] immigrants. Its representatives claim a [[zero tolerance]] policy and the combat of corruption. With the denial of a [[multiethnic society]] (''[[Überfremdung]]'') and the [[islamization]], their politics extend to far-right positions. Other minor right-wing populist parties include the [[German Freedom Party]] founded in 2010, the former East German [[German Social Union (East Germany)|German Social Union]] (DSU) and the dissolved [[Party for a Rule of Law Offensive]] ("Schill party").

The [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] has grown significantly in Greece during the country's economic downturn, gaining 7% of the vote and 18 out of 300 seats in the [[Hellenic Parliament]].

LN's program advocates the transformation of Italy into a federal state, fiscal federalism and greater regional autonomy, especially for the Northern regions. At times, the party has advocated for the secession of the North, which it calls [[Padania]]. The party generally takes an anti-[[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] stance as members are known for opposing Southern Italian emigration to Northern Italian cities, stereotyping Southern Italians as welfare abusers and detrimental to Italian society and attributing Italy's economic troubles and the disparity of the [[Economy of Italy#North–South divide|North-South divide in the Italian economy]] to supposed inherent negative characteristics of the Southern Italians, such as laziness, lack of education or criminality.&lt;ref name=tambini&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tambini|first1=Damian|title=Nationalism in Italian Politics: The Stories of the Northern League, 1980–2000|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pW009kl_z2AC&amp;pg=PT25&amp;lpg=PT25&amp;dq=northern+league+terroni&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TE3Abc6Wte&amp;sig=fjTS7lcvCj4k509c7FZKdo7A0ZQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBGoVChMIl6mwnpjmyAIVwXM-Ch00GwfA#v=onepage&amp;q=northern%20league%20terroni&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bullaro/&gt;&lt;ref name=willey&gt;{{cite news|last1=Willey|first1=David|title=The rise and fall of Northern League founder Umberto Bossi|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17703460|accessdate=28 October 2015|agency=BBC News|date=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pullella&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pullella|first1=Philip|title=Italy unity anniversary divides more than unites|url=http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSLNE72706B20110308|accessdate=28 October 2015|agency=Reuters|date=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain LN members have been known to publicly deploy the offensive slur "''[[terrone]]''", a common pejorative term for Southern Italians that is evocative of negative Southern Italian stereotypes.&lt;ref name=tambini/&gt;&lt;ref name=bullaro&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russo Bullaro|first1=Grace|title=From Terrone to Extracomunitario: New Manifestations of Racism in Contemporary Italian Cinema : Shifting Demographics and Changing Images in a Multi-cultural Globalized Society|date=2010|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|pages=179–81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBTMi_XXCgYC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=northern+league+terroni&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NJmyMDjED1&amp;sig=0g-JlhJaP0FcRALbo74wHRTehDE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAWoVChMIl6mwnpjmyAIVwXM-Ch00GwfA#v=onepage&amp;q=northern%20league%20terroni&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=garau&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garau|first1=Eva|title=Politics of National Identity in Italy: Immigration and 'Italianità'|date=17 December 2014|publisher=Routledge|pages=110–11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2vfBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=northern+league+terroni+denigration&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMItrP6tpzmyAIVRHY-Ch1g1QzM#v=onepage&amp;q=northern%20league%20terroni%20denigration&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a federalist, regionalist, populist party of the North, LN is also highly critical of the centralized power and political importance of [[Rome]], sometimes adopting to a lesser extent an anti-Roman stance in addition to an anti-Southern stance.

With the rise of immigration into Italy since the late 1990s, LN has increasingly turned its attention to criticizing mass immigration to Italy. The LN, which also opposes [[illegal immigration]], is critical of [[Islam]] and proposes Italy's exit from the [[Eurozone]], is considered a [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] movement and as such it joined the [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]] (EFD) group in the [[European Parliament]] after the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Italy)|2009 European Parliament election]]. LN was or is part of the national government in 1994, 2001–2006, 2008–2011 and 2018-present. Most recently, the party, which notably includes among its members the Presidents of [[Lombardy]] and [[Veneto]], won 17.4% of the vote in the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 general election]], becoming the third-largest party in Italy (largest within the [[centre-right coalition]]). In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Italy)|2014 European election]], under the leadership of [[Matteo Salvini]] it took 6.2% of votes. Under Salvini, the party has to some extent embraced [[Italian nationalism]] and emphasised Euroscepticism, opposition to immigration and other "populist" policies, while forming an alliance with right-wing populist parties in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-20/italy-s-northern-league-is-suddenly-in-love-with-the-south|title=Italy’s Northern League Is Suddenly In Love With the South|date=20 February 2018|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2018|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/attualita/2017/07/24/news/rivoluzione-nella-lega-cambiano-nome-e-simbolo-e-scompare-il-nord-1.306615|title=Rivoluzione nella Lega: cambiano nome e simbolo|date=24 July 2017|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2017/10/27/news/lega_nord_nuovo_simbolo-179501278/|title=Lega, nuovo simbolo senza "nord".

[[Silvio Berlusconi]], leader of [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] and [[Prime Minister of Italy]] from 1994–1995, 2001–2006 and 2008–2011, has sometimes been described as a right-wing populist, although his party is not typically described as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Europe for the Europeans: The Foreign and Security Policy of the Populist Radical Right|first=Christina|last=Liang|year=2016|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Foreign Policy in Focus]]|title=What Europe Can Teach Us about Trump|date=23 November 2016|first=John|last=Feffer|url=http://fpif.org/europe-can-teach-us-trump/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[national conservatism|national conservative]], [[nationalism|nationalist]] and arguably right-wing populist parties are strong especially in [[Lazio]], the region around [[Rome]] and [[Southern Italy]]. Most of them are heirs of the [[Italian Social Movement]] (a [[neo-fascist]] party, whose best result was 8.7% of the vote in the [[Italian general election, 1972|1972 general election]]) and its successor [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] (which reached 15.7% of the vote in [[Italian general election, 1996|1996 general election]]). They include the [[Brothers of Italy]] (2.0% in 2013), [[The Right (Italy)|The Right]] (0.6%), [[New Force (Italy)|New Force]] (0.3%), ''[[CasaPound]]'' (0.1%), [[Tricolour Flame]] (0.1%), [[Social Idea Movement]] (0.01%) and ''Progetto Nazionale'' (0.01%).

Additionally, in the [[German language|German]]-speaking [[South Tyrol]] the local second-largest party, ''[[Die Freiheitlichen]]'', is often described as a right-wing populist party.

[[File:GW-Rotterdam-DSC 0218.jpg|thumb|upright 0.7|[[Geert Wilders]], leader of the [[Party for Freedom]]]]
In the [[Netherlands]], right-wing populism was represented in the 150-seat [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] in 1982, when the [[Centre Party (Netherlands)|Centre Party]] won a single seat. During the 1990s, a splinter party, the [[Centre Democrats (Netherlands)|Centre Democrats]], was slightly more successful, although its significance was still marginal. Not before 2002 did a right-wing populist party break through in the Netherlands, when the [[Pim Fortuyn List]] won 26 seats and subsequently formed a coalition with the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) and [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD). [[Pim Fortuyn|Fortuyn]], who had strong views against immigration, particularly by Muslims, was assassinated in May 2002, two weeks before the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1971883.stm | work=BBC News | title=In pictures: Death of Pim Fortuyn | date=7 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition had broken up by 2003, and the party went into steep decline until it was dissolved.

Since 2006, the [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV) has been represented in the House of Representatives. Following the 2010 general election, it has been in a pact with the [[2010 Dutch cabinet formation#Formateur Opstelten|right-wing minority government of CDA and VVD]] after it won 24 seats in the House of Representatives. The party is [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] and plays a leading role in the changing stance of the Dutch government towards [[European integration]] as they came second in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Netherlands)|2009 European Parliament election]], winning 4 out of 25 seats. The party's main programme revolves around strong [[Party for Freedom#Party programme|criticism of Islam,]] restrictions on migration from new European Union countries and Islamic countries, pushing for cultural assimilation of migrants into Dutch society, opposing the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]], advocating for the Netherlands to withdraw from the European Union and advocating for a return to the [[guilder]] through ending Dutch usage of the euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/geert-wilders-netherlands-dutch-election-freedom-pvv-far-right-donald-trump-a7576456.html|title=Far-right outcast Geert Wilders vows to 'de-Islamise' the Netherlands after taking lead in Dutch polls|date=12 February 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=24 March 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PVV withdrew its support for the [[First Rutte cabinet]] in 2012 after refusing to support austerity measures. This triggered the [[Dutch general election, 2012|2012 general election]] in which the PVV was reduced to 15 seats and excluded from the new government.

In the [[Dutch general election, 2017]], Wilders' PVV gained an extra five seats to become the second largest party in the Dutch House of Representatives, bringing their total to 20 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/15/europe/netherlands-dutch-elections/index.html|title=Dutch elections: Wilders' far-right party beaten, early results show|last=CNN|first=Lauren Said-Moorhouse and Bryony Jones|website=CNN|access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2017 onwards, the [[Forum for Democracy]] has emerged as another right-wing populist force in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Heinrich Böll Foundation]]|date=22 March 2017|title=The Dutch defeat ‘the wrong kind of populism’|url=https://www.boell.de/en/2017/03/22/dutch-defeat-wrong-kind-populism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Dutch Bad Boy Thierry Baudet the New Face of the European Alt-Right?|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/is-dutch-bad-boy-thierry-baudet-the-new-face-of-the-european-alt-right/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
The largest right-wing populist party in Poland is [[Law and Justice]], which currently holds both the presidency and a governing majority in the [[Sejm]].

Polish [[Congress of the New Right]], headed by Michał Marusik, aggressively promotes [[fiscally conservative]] concepts like radical tax reductions preceded by abolishment of social security, universal public healthcare, state-sponsored education and abolishment of Communist Polish 1944 agricultural reform as a way to dynamical economic and welfare growth.&lt;ref name="nczas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nczas.com/publicystyka/korwin-mikke-feudalizmie-wroc/|title=Korwin-Mikke: Feudalizmie wróć! &amp;#124; Najwyższy Czas!|publisher=nczas.com|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nowaprawicajkm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nowaprawicajkm.pl/info/program-wyborczy/program-kongresu-nowej-prawicy/item/program-kongresu-nowej-prawicy |title=Program KNP |publisher=nowaprawicajkm.pl |accessdate=3 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122821/http://www.nowaprawicajkm.pl/info/program-wyborczy/program-kongresu-nowej-prawicy/item/program-kongresu-nowej-prawicy |archivedate=7 January 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to lack of empirical and economic evidences presented by party leaders and members, the party is considered populist both by right-wing and left-wing publicists&lt;ref name="wsieci"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsieci.pl/korwin-mikke-guru-nonsensu-pnews-1010.html|title=Korwin-Mikke – guru nonsensu Gazeta wSieci|publisher=wsieci.pl|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lewica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lewica.pl/blog/derebecki/29708/|title=Wirus korwinizmu – Krzysztof Derebecki – Mój lewicowy punkt widzenia|publisher=lewica.pl|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
{{expand section|date=February 2018}}
The [[Sweden Democrats]] are the third largest party in Sweden with 17.53% of popular votes in the [[Swedish general election, 2018|parliamentary election of 2018]].

====Switzerland====
{{see also|Far-right politics in Switzerland}}
In [[Switzerland]], the right-wing populist [[Swiss People's Party]] (SVP) reached an all-time high in the [[Swiss federal election, 2015|2015 elections]]. The party is mainly considered to be [[National conservatism|national conservative]],{{sfn|Skenderovic|2009|loc=p. 124: "... and prefers to use terms such as 'national-conservative' or 'conservative-right' in defining the SVP. In particular, 'national-conservative' has gained prominence among the definitions used in Swiss research on the SVP"}}{{sfn|Geden|2006|p=95}} but it has also variously been identified as "extreme right"{{sfn|Ignazi|2006|p=234}} and "radical right-wing populist",&lt;ref&gt;H-G Betz, 'Xenophobia, Identity Politics and Exclusionary Populism in Western Europe', L. Panitch &amp; C. Leys (eds.), ''Socialist Register 2003 – Fighting Identities: Race, Religion and Ethno-nationalism'', London: Merlin Press, 2002, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting a spectrum of ideologies present among its members. In its far-right wing, it includes members such as [[Ulrich Schlüer]], [[Pascal Junod]], who heads a [[Neue Rechte|New Right]] study group. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020421064426/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2000-1/switzerland.htm |archive-date=21 April 2002 |dead-url=yes |title=Antisemitism And Racism in Switzerland 2000-1 |accessdate=3 January 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw99-2000/switzerland.htm|title=Antisemitism and Racism in Switzerland 1999–2000|work=tau.ac.il|accessdate=28 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025055218/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw99-2000/switzerland.htm|archivedate=25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Switzerland, radical right populist parties held close to 10% of the popular vote in 1971, were reduced to below 2% by 1979 and again grew to more than 10% in 1991. Since 1991, these parties (the [[Swiss Democrats]] and the [[Swiss Freedom Party]]) have been absorbed by the SVP. During the 1990s, the SVP grew from being the fourth largest party to being the largest and gained a second seat the [[Swiss Federal Council]] in 2003, with prominent politician and businessman [[Christoph Blocher]]. In 2015, the SVP received 29.4% of the vote, the highest vote ever recorded for a single party throughout Swiss parliamentary history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-immigration party wins Swiss election in 'slide to the Right'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/switzerland/11939953/Anti-immigration-party-wins-Swiss-election-in-slide-to-the-Right.html|accessdate=19 October 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|agency=Reuters|date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-immigration SVP wins Swiss election in big swing to right|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34569881|accessdate=19 October 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Larson|first1=Nina|title=Swiss parliament shifts to right in vote dominated by migrant fears|url=https://news.yahoo.com/swiss-populist-set-win-third-parliament-seats-media-161821935.html|accessdate=19 October 2015|agency=AFP|publisher=Yahoo!|date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amid rising fears over refugees, far-right party gains ground in Swiss election|url=http://www.dw.com/en/amid-rising-fears-over-refugees-far-right-party-gains-ground-in-swiss-election/a-18790343|accessdate=19 October 2015|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Moore (1996) argues that "populist opposition to the growing power of political, economic, and cultural elites" helped shape "conservative and right-wing movements" since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard J. Moore, "Good Old-Fashioned New Social History and the Twentieth-Century American Right," ''Reviews in American History'' vol 24#4 (1996) pp. 555–73, quote at p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; Historical right-wing populist figures in both major parties in the United States have included [[Thomas E.

The [[Tea Party movement]] has been characterized as "a right-wing anti-systemic populist movement" by Rasmussen and Schoen (2010). They add: "Today our country is in the midst of a...new populist revolt that has emerged overwhelmingly from the right – manifesting itself as the Tea Party movement".&lt;ref&gt;Scott Rasmussen and Doug Schoen, ''Mad As Hell: How the Tea Party Movement Is Fundamentally Remaking Our Two-Party System'' (2010) quotes on p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[David Barstow]] wrote in ''The New York Times'': "The Tea Party movement has become a platform for conservative populist discontent".&lt;ref&gt;David Barstow, "Tea Party Lights Fuse for Rebellion on Right," [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/us/politics/16teaparty.html ''New York Times'' Feb 6, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Some political figures closely associated with the Tea Party, such as U.S. Senator [[Ted Cruz]] and former U.S. Representative [[Ron Paul]], have been described as appealing to right-wing populism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/ted-cruz-donald-trump-endorsement|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|title=What On Earth Is Ted Cruz Doing?|date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Economist]]|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21679792-america-and-europe-right-wing-populist-politicians-are-march-threat|title=Playing with fear|date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Yuri|last=Maltsev|title=The Tea Party Explained: From Crisis to Crusade|year=2013|publisher=Open Court|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], the [[Freedom Caucus]], which is associated with the Tea Party movement, has been described as right-wing populist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=7 April 2017|title=In The Freedom Caucus, Trump Meets His Match|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/04/in-the-freedom-caucus-trump-meets-his-match/522243/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''right to adequate clothing''', or the '''right to clothing''', is recognized as a [[human right]] in various [[international human rights instruments]]; this, together with the [[right to food]] and the [[right to housing]], are parts of the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] as recognized under [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights#Right to an adequate standard of living|Article 11]] of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR). The right to clothing is similarly recognized under [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 25|Article 25]] of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR).{{sfn |James |2008 |p=1}}

==Beneficiaries==
The right to clothing forms an aspect of the right to an adequate standard of living, and as such, is regarded as something that needs to be ensured so as to prevent people from living below the poverty line.{{sfn |IHRC |2014}} Indeed, being ill-clothed is emblematic of acute poverty:

{{Quote |We see it in the shivering or sweltering discomfort of 'beggars,' the homeless, the drug dependent and the 'derelict,' the elderly, the invalided, the 'street kid' or the just plain poor. Their plight has provoked condemnation, blame, disgust and derision, but religious, moral and secular creeds have in contrast exhorted us to respond with love, charity, mercy, with empathy and in a spirit of justice.{{sfn |James |2008 |pp=1-2}}|Dr Stephen James |A Forgotten Right? The Right to Clothing in International Law}}

To illustrate how far-reaching the right to clothing potentially is, Dr Stephen James has provided a non-exhaustive list of beneficiaries of the right to minimum clothing. Included on this list are those sections of society that suffer the greatest from a lack of clothing, such as:{{sfn |James |2008 |p=3}}

[[File:Homesless in Roma.jpg|thumb|The homeless are a section of society that suffer greatly from a lack of adequate clothing.]]
[[File:Street Child, Srimangal Railway Station.jpg|thumb|[[Street child]]ren also suffer greatly.]]

* The poor, including the [[unemployed]], [[underemployment|under-employed]] and [[working poor]];
* [[Pensioner]]s and others dependent on [[social security]];
* The [[homeless]] and others in inadequate shelter;
* Those in emergency accommodation (for example, [[Women's Refuges|women's refuges]]), whether of a state or private character (including charitable accommodation);
* The elderly, whether in privately owned or rented accommodation, or state, commercial or charitable nursing homes, hospitals and hospices;
* Persons suffering from serious mental illness or from intellectual or physical disabilities (whether the live at home independently, with family members or others, or in Community Residential Units, half-way houses, public or private hospitals and other institutions);
* Children and adolescents, especially [[orphans]] and juvenile offenders in foster care, state institutions or detention centres;
* The ill and injured in hospitals (or rehabilitation centres), including those being treated for [[alcoholism]] and other [[Drug addiction|drug-related dependencies]];
* Prisoners, on remand or otherwise;
* Workers in hazardous industries (for instance, [[chemical manufacturing]] and [[mining]] industries), or working under generally oppressive conditions (for example, [[sweatshops]]), whose lives or health depend on protective clothing (including child workers);
* [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous persons]] living in impoverished conditions;
* [[Refugees]], [[asylum-seekers]], and [[migrant workers]] (especially those working in the black market as '[[illegal aliens]]'); and,
* The victims of natural disasters, civil unrest, civil and international war (including [[prisoners of war]]), [[Genocide|genocidal persecutions]] and other traumatic dislocations.

== Recognition ==
The lack of discussion about the right to clothing has led to uncertainty as to the ambit of the right and how much clothing is required. Matthew Craven notes that a minimum level of clothing is what is required to be provided; it is of "paramount importance not least because at minimum levels it represents a question of survival." {{sfn |Craven |1995 |p=287}} This requirement of a "minimum" or "adequate" standard is mirrored in reports from the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child|UN Committee on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC){{sfn |CRC |2005}} and a report from the Consortium For Street Children,{{sfn |CSC |2009}} as well as a number of General Comments from the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (CESCR) as regards the elderly,{{sfn |CESCR |1996}} disabled,{{sfn |CESCR |1995}} and workers.{{sfn |CESCR |2000}} There is, however, no indication as to what such a "minimum" or "adequate" standard entails: indeed, only rarely has the CESCR questioned a party state of the ICESCR on its performance with respect to the right to clothing.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=4}}{{sfn |Craven |1995 |pp=349, 413}}

There has been limited academic commentary on the ambit of the right to clothing with regards to refugees. James Hathaway has argued that refugees should have access to clothing that suitable for the climate and is sufficient for any work or other roles they may wish to undertake. Furthermore, they should not be compelled to wear any sort of clothing that would lead to social stigma or discrimination as foreigners.{{sfn |Hathaway |2005 |p=503}} On the other hand, however, should refugees choose to wear clothing that is representative of their culture, country of origin or society, they are protected under Article 27 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] to do so.{{sfn |Hathaway |2005 |p=504}} The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has tended towards applying context-specific interpretations on what is an adequate standard of clothing; so far, the right in its general sense has not yet been considered in a general comment.{{sfn |Hathaway |2005 |p=504, footnote 1047}}

The right to clothing has been recognised domestically for millennia &amp;nbsp;– at least partially &amp;nbsp;– but has received very little recognition on the international scene.{{sfn |James |2008 |pp=1-2}} It is not clear why there is a lack of recognition; one author has suggested that the lack of elaboration is due to the variations in cultural needs and wants.{{sfn |IHRC |2014}} However, this explanation has been regarded as "not plausible": Dr James notes that "[c]ultural, environmental and economic variations in 'needs and wants' are surely as marked with regard to housing, health as they are in relation to clothing, but this has not prevented detailed elaboration of those rights in international law."{{sfn |James |2008 |p=4}} Matthew Craven concluded in 1995 that:

{{quote|The right to clothing, although specifically included in the Covenant, has had little attention either from the Committee [CESCR] or independent commentators. As far as the Committee is concerned, no reference to clothing is to be found in reporting guidelines, and only the occasional question has been asked of States by individual members. The impression given is that clothing is not a matter in which the State may exercise a great deal of control, nor one that the Committee feels is of great importance.{{sfn |Craven |1995 |pp=349, 413}}|Matthew Craven |The international covenant on economic, social, and cultural rights : a perspective on its development}}

However, Dr James has remarked: "...none of us can be complacent that we will not find ourselves [...] in need of adequate clothing. The right is of great practical importance. It is an essential subsistence right, not an embellishment or a legal absurdity".{{sfn |James |2008 |p=4}} He also called for further discussion and academic commentary, arguing:

{{quote|We must remember the right to adequate clothing when examining the right to an adequate standard of living in international law. The health, dignity and very lives of a range of vulnerable people [...] can be at risk when they are not adequately clothed. [...] [I]t will be useful to explore the possibilities that lie in reasoning by analogy from CESCR jurisprudence on other rights within Article 11 of the ICESCR. After all, the CESCR has begun to develop criteria, in some cases quite detailed, regarding required standards in relation to 'adequate' housing, health, food, water and so on. There is no reason why a similar approach might not be undertaken in relation to the right to adequate clothing.{{sfn |James |2008 |pp=23-24}}|Dr Stephen James |A Forgotten Right? The Right to Clothing in International Law}}

==Interaction between the right to clothing and other human rights==

As the right to clothing concerns such a fundamental aspect of humanity, it naturally interacts with other human rights that are contained within various human rights instruments.{{sfn |James |2008 |pp=13-17}}

===Right to life===
{{main|Right to Life}}

Everyone has the essential right to life, as confirmed under [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 3|Article 3]] of the UDHR. However, if people are not adequately clothed, they are far more exposed to the elements. Without warm clothing, a person may well die from [[hypothermia]] during a cold winter; clothing that is inappropriately warm, on the other hand, could contribute to [[heat stroke]], [[dehydration]] and [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] during summer or in tropical climates. Furthermore, inadequate clothing could increase exposure to [[ultraviolet rays]]; aggravate [[Allergy|allergies]] and skin conditions; and worsen pre-existing medical conditions.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=12}}

Additionally, access to medical care&amp;nbsp;– similarly confirmed under [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 25|Article 25]] of the UDHR as well as [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights#Right to health|Article 12]] of the ICESCR &amp;nbsp;– can be impeded by inadequate access to clothing, particularly if the access to therapeutic clothing or orthopedic footwear is unavailable or prohibitively expensive.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=12}}

===Right to freedom of expression===
{{main|Freedom of speech}}

Wearing clothes&amp;nbsp;– or more accurately, choosing which clothes to wear&amp;nbsp;– is, for many people, an important part of expression as confirmed under [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 19|Article 19]] of the UDHR. Persons with serious disabilities may be dress inappropriately, denying their desired expression. Furthermore, being forced to wear dirty, ripped, ill-fitting and even extremely outdated clothing may invite ridicule and contempt and inflict shame.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=13}} This can be particularly true with school children &amp;nbsp;– parents may be reluctant to consider sending a child to school as a result of ridicule and shame brought through the clothing the child wears.{{sfn |Kornbluh |2007 |pp=39–41}} A distinction should be drawn, however, between those who are forced to wear ripped, ill-fitting or extremely outdated clothing and those who consciously choose to wear such clothes as a 'fashion statement'.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=13}}

===Right to freedom from discrimination===
{{main|Freedom from discrimination}}

The clothes that people choose to wear can identify a great number of things about a person: religious affiliations, ethnicity, national or political identity, culture, or race. Arguably, the clothes that an impoverished person wears can indicate their poverty. This sign of poverty or poorer economic status can be a cause of discrimination and of vilification. Additionally, clothing which is culturally distinctive or [[Religious clothing|denotes religious affiliation]] could provoke discrimination and lead to a denial of social, economic, or political opportunities.{{sfn |James |2008 |p=14}}

===Right to freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment===
{{main|Torture|Cruel and unusual punishment}}

There is a large potential for "abuses of trust, for humiliations and various physical abuses in medical and institutional settings, especially in relation to women and children, the disabled and elderly."{{sfn |James |2008 |p=14}} If a person is denied access to adequate clothing &amp;nbsp;– especially essential clothes, such as undergarments &amp;nbsp;– it is possible that they may be rendered vulnerable to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment under the ambit of [[Universal declaration of human rights#Article 5|Article 5]] of the UDHR. Such denial would include forcibly taking clothes, and is of particular importance in the context of detention and prisons: "[o]ne can literally be left naked in the midst of power, a tragic condition [...] seen too often in prisons, in war and in concentration camps."{{sfn |James |2008 |p=14}} Examples of such abuses in [[Abu Ghraib]] prison in Iraq and [[Guantanamo Bay]] have found to have caused serious mental illnesses, including [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], resulting from forcing prisoners to strip naked and parade in front of female guards, as well as male detainees being forced to wear female underwear.{{sfn |Hess |2008}}

The '''Saint Patrick's Battalion''' ({{lang-es|Batallón de San Patricio}}), formed and led by [[John Riley (soldier)|John Riley]], was a unit of 175 to several hundred [[immigration|immigrants]] (accounts vary) and [[expatriate]]s of European descent who fought as part of the [[Mexican Armed Forces|Mexican Army]] against the United States in the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–48. Most of the battalion's members had [[desertion|deserted]] or [[defection|defected]] from the [[United States Army]]. The Battalion served as an artillery unit for much of the war. Despite later being formally designated as two infantry companies, it still retained artillery pieces throughout the conflict. In many ways, the battalion acted as the sole Mexican counterbalance to the recent U.S. innovation of [[horse artillery]]. The "San Patricios" were responsible for the toughest battles encountered by the United States in its invasion of Mexico, with [[Ulysses S. Grant]] remarking that "[[Battle of Churubusco|Churubusco]] proved to be about the severest battle fought in the [[valley of Mexico]]".{{sfn|Grant|1885|p=115}}

Composed primarily of [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants, the battalion also included [[Germans]], [[Canadians]], [[English people|English]], [[French people|French]], [[Italians]], [[Poles]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[Spanish people|Spaniards]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], and [[Mexican people|Mexicans]], many of whom were members of the [[Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Miller|1989|pp=188–192}} Disenfranchised [[United States|Americans]] were in the ranks, including escaped slaves from the [[Southern United States]].{{sfn|Callaghan|1995}} Only a few members of the Saint Patrick's Battalion were actual U.S. citizens. The Mexican government printed [[propaganda]] in different languages to entice immigrants in the U.S. Army to switch sides and offered incentives to foreigners who would enlist in its army including granting them citizenship, paying higher wages than the U.S. Army, and generous land grants.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The San Patricios are revered and honoured in Mexico and Ireland. Members of the Battalion are known to have deserted from U.S. Army regiments including; the 1st Artillery, the 2nd Artillery, the 3rd Artillery, the 4th Artillery, the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd Dragoons]], the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|2nd Infantry]], the [[3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)|3rd Infantry]], the [[4th Infantry Regiment (United States)|4th Infantry]], the [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|5th Infantry]], the
[[6th Infantry Regiment (United States)|6th Infantry]], the [[7th Infantry Regiment (United States)|7th Infantry]] and the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th Infantry]].{{sfn|Hopkins|1913|pp=283–284}}

==Historical perspective==
[[File:Saint Patrick's Battalion 1847, plaque Mexico.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Commemorative plaque placed at the San Jacinto Plaza in the district of [[San Ángel]], [[Mexico City]] in 1959: "In memory of the Irish soldiers of the heroic St. Patrick's Battalion, martyrs who gave their lives to the Mexican cause in the United States' unjust invasion of 1847"]]
For Mexicans of the generation that fought the [[Mexican–American War]], and generations to come, the San Patricios were heroes who came to their aid in an hour of need. For US-Americans of that generation, the San Patricios were considered traitors.{{sfn|Hogan|1998|p=223}} Successive Mexican presidents have praised the San Patricios; [[Vicente Fox Quesada]] stated that "The affinities between Ireland and Mexico go back to the first years of our nation, when our country fought to preserve its national sovereignty... Then, a brave group of Irish soldiers... in a heroic gesture, decided to fight against the foreign ground invasion",{{sfn|Connaughton|2005}} and Mexican president [[Ernesto Zedillo]] stated "Members of the St. Patrick's Battalion were executed for following their consciences. They were martyred for adhering to the highest ideals ... we honor their memory. In the name of the people of Mexico, I salute today the people of Ireland and express my eternal gratitude".{{sfn|Fogarty|2005}}

The great majority of these men were recent immigrants who had arrived at northeastern U.S. ports, part of the [[Irish diaspora]] then escaping the [[Great Irish Famine]] and extremely poor economic conditions in [[Ireland]], part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] at the time. The U.S. Army often recruited Irishmen and other immigrants into military service shortly or sometimes immediately after arrival in America in [[coffin ships]], with promises of salaries and land after the war.

Numerous theories have been proposed as to their motives for desertion, including cultural alienation,{{sfn|Mermann-Jozwiak|2001|p=150}}{{sfn|Rollins|2008|pp=91-92}} mistreatment of [[immigrant]] soldiers by [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] soldiers and senior officers,{{sfn|Ballentine|1860|pp=34–35 &amp; 281–282}}{{sfn|Rollins|2008|pp=91-92}} brutal military discipline and dislike of service in the U.S. military,{{sfn|Rollins|2008|pp=91-92}} being forced to attend Protestant church services and being unable to practice their [[freedom of religion|Catholic religion freely]]{{sfn|Radford Ruether|2007|p=81}} as well as religious ideological convictions,{{sfn|Rollins|2008|pp=91-92}} the incentive of higher wages and land grants starting at {{convert|320|acre|km2}} offered by Mexico,{{sfn|Downey|1955}}{{sfn|Rollins|2008|pp=91-92}} and viewing the U.S. invasion of Mexico as unjust.{{sfn|Radford Ruether|2007|p=81}}{{sfn|Woolf|2015}}

It is believed primary motivations were shared religion with the Mexicans and sympathy for the Mexican cause based on similarities between the situations in Mexico and Ireland. This hypothesis is based on evidence of the number of Irish Catholics in the Battalion, the letters of [[John Riley (soldier)|John Riley]], and the field entries of senior officers.{{sfn|Lloyd|2000|p=104}}{{sfn|Hogan|1998|p=152}} Another hypothesis is that the members of the Saint Patrick's Battalion had been unhappy with their treatment in the U.S. Army; this was the conviction of George Ballentine, an Englishman who served in the American army. Ballentine stated that while "there was a portion of truth" in the view—commonly assigned by officers—that the deserters joined the Mexican army due to their Catholicism, "I have good reason to believe, in fact in some cases I know, that harsh and unjust treatment by their officers operated far more strongly than any other consideration to produce the deplorable result [desertion]," describing how he found the punishments used for "trivial offensives" to be "revolting and disgusting".{{sfn|Ballentine|1860|p=281–282}} Another theory some historians hold is that the soldiers were attracted by the incentives offered by the Mexican government: safe passage throughout Mexico for deserters, generous land grants, and the offer of potential military commissions.{{sfn|Ramold|2010|p=39}} For poor people coming from famine conditions, economics was often an important incentive.{{sfn|McCornack|1958|p=255}}

Mexican author José Raúl Conseco noted that many Irish lived in northern Texas, and were forced to move south due to regional insecurity.&lt;!-- Presumably this is found in José Raúl Canseco Botello's "Historia de Matamoros" --&gt; Mainly Irish settlers from [[San Patricio, Texas]] had previously sided with Mexican forces against Texan rebels at the [[Battle of Lipantitlán]] in the [[Texan Revolution]].{{sfn|Super|1992|p=136}}

Irish expatriates had a long tradition of serving in military forces of Catholic countries, for instance, serving with Spain and later France in groups of young men who had left Ireland during what would become known as the [[Flight of the Wild Geese]] in the 17th century. In addition, many Irish fought as soldiers in [[South American wars of independence]].{{Ref label|C|c|none}}

==Flag==
{{Further|List of flags of Ireland}}
There are conflicting accounts of the design of the flag of the Saint Patrick's Battalion. No flags or depictions of them are known to have survived to the present day. The only version of the flag known to have survived the war was subsequently lost or stolen from the chapel at [[West Point]].{{sfn|Hogan|2011|p=252-3}}

John Riley, who left an account of the battalion, noted the flag in a letter:
{{pull quote| In all my letter, I forgot to tell you under what banner we fought so bravely. It was that glorious Emblem of native rights, that being the banner which should have floated over our native Soil many years ago, it was St. Patrick, the [[Coat of arms of Ireland#Green flag of Ireland|Harp of Erin]], the [[Shamrock]] upon a green field. |author= John Riley |source= {{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=285}}}}

[[File:Erin Go Bragh Banner.svg|thumb|290px|The [[green harp flag]] in its 18th to 19th century design, showing the "Maid of Erin" as the harp's pillar, her wing forming the harp's neck, and the inscription ''Erin go Bragh'' ("Ireland forever")]]According to an American journalist covering the war with Mexico:
{{pull quote|The banner is of green silk, and on one side is a harp, surmounted by the Mexican coat of arms, with a scroll on which is painted ''Libertad por la Republica Mexicana'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[Liberty for the Mexican Republic]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Under the harp is the motto of ''Erin go Bragh!'' On the other side is a painting ... made to represent St. Patrick, in his left hand a key and in his right a crook or staff resting upon a serpent.  Underneath is painted ''San Patricio.''| author=[[George Wilkins Kendall]]|source={{sfn|Kendall|1999|p=350}}}}
Two other eye-witness accounts of the flag exist, both from American soldiers. The first describes it as:
{{pull quote|...a beautiful green silk banner &lt;nowiki&gt;[which]&lt;/nowiki&gt; waved over their heads; on it glittered a silver cross and a golden harp, embroidered by the hands of the fair nuns of [[San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí|San Luis Potosí]]. | author=[[Samuel Chamberlain|Samuel E. Chamberlain]], ''My Confession'' |source={{sfn|Miller|1989|p=38}}}}
The second notes only:
{{pull quote|Among the mighty host we passed was O'Reilly [''sic''] and his company of deserters bearing aloft in high disgrace the holy banner of St. Patrick."| author= [[Kentucky]] cavalryman (Mexican [[POW]]), name unknown |source={{sfn|Miller|1989|p=52}}}}

A radically different version of the flag was described in this Mexican source:
{{pull quote|''Tenían una insignia blanca, en la que se encontraban los escudos de Irlanda y Mexico, y el nombre de su capitán, John O'Reilly bordado en verde.'' [They had a white flag/standard, on which were found the shields of Ireland and Mexico, and the name of their captain, John O'Reilly [''sic''] embroidered in green.]|author=''Diccionario Porrúa de historia, biografía y geografía de México'' &amp;#124; (3:3146)}}

Whatever the case, in 1997 a reproduction military flag was created by the Clifden and Connemara Heritage Group. Another was created the following year for the MGM film ''[[One Man's Hero]]''. The film was a romanticised version of the San Patricios' history. A third version embodying the description of the San Luis Potosí flag was made for the Irish Society of Chicago, which hung it in Chicago's [[Union League|Union League Club]].

Some theories suggest that the Saint Patrick's Battalion might have used different banners (as an artillery unit, an infantry company and as a reconstructed unit).{{sfn|Ferrigan III|2000}}

==Service as a military unit==

===Formation and early engagements===
Present in the Mexican Army for the battles of [[Battle of Palo Alto|Palo Alto]] and [[Resaca de la Palma]] were the ''Legión de Extranjeros'' (Legion of Foreigners); the men who would later make up the core of the Saint Patrick's battalion. Meanwhile, deserters were abandoning General Taylor's army on the [[Rio Grande]].{{sfn|Grant|1885|p=115}} Riley and "a company of 48 Irishmen"{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=291}} manned Mexican artillery at the [[Siege of Fort Texas]], which took place concurrently to the two other battles. [[Martin Tritschler]], [[German Mexican]] and a Captain at the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]], is attributed with convincing a large number of German soldiers to defect from the U.S. occupying forces in [[Puebla, Puebla]].

The Saint Patrick's Battalion first fought as a recognised Mexican unit in the [[Battle of Monterrey]] on 21 September 1846, as an [[artillery battery]]. Popularly they were called ''Los Colorados'' by the Mexicans because of their ruddy, sun-burnt complexions and red hair color.{{sfn|Wallace|1950|p=85}}{{sfn|Bauer|1992|p=42}} They were commanded by [[John Riley (soldier)|John Riley]],{{Ref label|B|b|2}} an Irish artilleryman and veteran [[non-commissioned officer]] of the British Army, who possibly arrived in Canada in 1843 whilst serving in the [[British Army]] (the assertion that he served as a [[Sergeant]] in the [[66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot]],{{sfn|Wallace|1950|p=85}} is known to be inaccurate){{sfn|Miller|1989|p=27}} going on to join the U.S. Army in Michigan in September 1845. He deserted in Matamoros in April 1846.{{sfn|Hogan|1998|p=42}} Upon meeting Mexican forces he was initially given the [[Officer (armed forces)|Officer]] rank of [[Lieutenant]] by [[General]] [[Pedro de Ampudia]].{{sfn|Hopkins|1913|p=280}}
[[File:Monterey U.S.S Grantp114.jpg|thumb|170px|left|San Patricios defended the city of Monterrey with artillery fire from its citadel, indicated here with the key "F"{{Ref label|D|d|none}}]]

At the battle of Monterrey the San Patricios proved their artillery skills by causing the deaths of many American soldiers, and they are credited with defeating two{{sfn|Howes|2003|p=181}} to three{{sfn|Callaghan|1995}} separate assaults into the heart of the city. Among their targets were companies led by such officers as [[Braxton Bragg]], many of whose soldiers would end up in their own ranks later in the war.{{sfn|Stevens|1999|pp=150 &amp; 172–173}} Their tenacity, however, did not affect the Mexican commanders' decision to capitulate and abandon the position.

Following the engagement at [[Monterrey]], the San Patricios grew in number, by some estimates reaching an enlistment of over 700 men.{{sfn|Hopkins|1913|p=280}}{{sfn|Chamberlain|1853|p=226}} Forces re-assembled at [[San Luis Potosí]] and they had their distinct green silk flag embroidered there.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

===Buena Vista===
{{Main|Battle of Buena Vista}}
They then marched northward after joining a larger force commanded by [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] sent from Mexico City, the "liberating army of the North". At the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] (known as the battle of Angostura in Mexico) in [[Coahuila]] on 23 February, the Patricios became engaged with U.S. forces. They were assigned the three heaviest — 18 and 24 pound—[[cannons]] the Mexican army possessed, which were positioned on high ground over-looking the [[battle]]field, at the base of a hillside (just below what is now a gravel mine).{{sfn|Cave|2013}} They were later described as "a strong Mexican battery ... moved ... by dint of extraordinary exertions ... [that] commanded the entire plateau".{{sfn|Smith|1919a|p=391}}

They started the battle supporting Mexican infantry by firing on U.S. lines as the Mexicans advanced on them, then later decimating an artillery battery directly opposite them on the battlefield (Washington’s 4th Artillery, D Battery). A small number of San Patricios were dispatched with a [[Division (military)|division]] commanded by [[Manuel Lombardini]] with the express purpose of capturing the 4th's cannons once the crews had been dealt with. As the division got close enough they charged the artillery battery, bayoneting whoever remained and [[rout]]ing the rest, leaving the attached San Patricios free to haul away two six-pound cannons.{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=195}} These cannons would later be used by Mexican forces at the [[Battle of Contreras]].{{sfn|Downey|1955}}

In frustration U.S. Commander [[Zachary Taylor]], referring to the Saint Patrick's Battalion, ordered a [[Squadron (cavalry)|squadron]] of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)#Mexican War|1st Dragoons]] to "take that damned battery".{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=193}} In this task they failed, and, badly bloodied, were forced to retreat.{{sfn|Downey|1955}} At about 1 p.m. the San Patricios covered a Mexican retreat as a disordered mass of infantry sought refuge during a lull in the fighting.{{sfn|Smith|1919a|p=393}} The San Patricios rode out the day in a costly artillery duel with several American batteries,{{sfn|Smith|1919a|p=395}} which killed and injured roughly one third of them.{{sfn|Fogarty|2005}} General Francisco Mejia’s Battle Report for Buena Vista described the San Patricios’ as "worthy of the most consummate praise because the men fought with daring bravery."{{sfn|Paredes|2010}} Several Irishmen were awarded the [[Military decorations of Mexico#War Cross|War Cross]] by the Mexican government for their conduct in that battle, and many received field promotions.{{sfn|Fogarty|2005}}{{sfn|Hogan|2006}}

===Re-organization and final battles===
Despite their excellent performance in a number of engagements as artillery, the much-reduced San Patricios were ordered to muster a larger [[infantry]] [[battalion]] in mid-1847 by personal order of Santa Anna. It was renamed ''The Foreign Legion of Patricios'' and consisted of volunteers from many European countries, commanded by Col. Francisco R. Moreno, with Riley in charge of 1st [[Company (military unit)|company]] and Santiago O'Leary heading up the second.{{sfn|Fogarty|2005}} Desertion handbills were produced, specially targeting Catholic Irish, French and German immigrants in the invading U.S. army and stating that "You must not fight against a religious people, nor should you be seen in the ranks of those who proclaim slavery of mankind as a constitutive principle ... liberty is not on the part of those who desire to be lords of the world, robbing properties and territories which do not belong to them and shedding so much blood in order to accomplish their views, views in open war to the principles of our holy religion".{{sfn|Zinn|Arnove|2004|pp=157–158}}

[[File:Churubusco-convent.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Churubusco]]'s monastery at the height of the 1847 [[Battle of Churubusco]], painted by James Walker]]
The [[Battle of Churubusco]] (20 August 1847) took place about four months after the defeat at Cerro Gordo. Gen. Santa Anna gave a verbal order to "preserve the point at all risk".{{sfn|Ramsey|1850|p=283}} The San Patricio Companies initially met the attackers outside the walls of the convent at a [[Bridgehead|tête-de-pont]], which was about {{convert|500|yd|m|0}} from a fortified convent.{{sfn|Ramsey|1850|p=284}} A battery of three{{sfn|Smith|1919b|p=111}} to five{{sfn|Ramsey|1850|p=284}} heavy cannons were used from this position to hold off the American advance along with support from ''Los Independencia Batallón'' and ''Los Bravos Batallón''.{{sfn|Smith|1919b|p=111}} The Americans were under the command of [[William Hoffman (United States Army)|Col. William Hoffman]].{{sfn|Grant|1885|p=114}} Several U.S. charges towards the bridgehead were thrown off,{{sfn|Smith|1919b|p=115}} with the San Patricio companies serving as an example to the supporting battalions.{{sfn|Smith|1919b|p=114}} Unlike the San Patricios, most of whom were veterans (many having served in the armies of the United Kingdom and various German states), the supporting Mexican battalions were simply [[militia]] (the term 'National Guard' is also used{{sfn|Ramsey|1850|p=283}}) who had been untested by battle.{{sfn|Smith|1919b|p=111}}

A lack of ammunition led the Mexican soldiers in the trenches between the bridgehead and the convent to disband; without ammunition, they had no way to fight back.{{sfn|Ramsey|1850|p=286}} Santa Anna had ordered half of these soldiers to a different part of the battlefield.{{sfn|Smith|1919b|p=116}} When the requested ammunition wagon finally arrived, the 9 ½ [[drachm]] cartridges were compatible with none but the San Patricio Companies "[[Brown Bess]]" muskets, and they made up only a fraction of the defending forces.{{sfn|Ramsey|1850|p=295}} Further hampering Mexican efforts, a stray spark from an artillery piece firing [[grape shot]] at the on-coming U.S. troops caused the just-arrived ammunition to explode and set fire to several men, including Captain O'Leary and Gen.l Anaya.{{sfn|Ramsey|1850|p=296}} A [[Withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]] behind the walls of the [[Monastery|''convento de Churubusco'']] was called when the threat of being outflanked proved too great.{{sfn|Downey|1955}}
[[File:George Ballentine Mexican-American war -2.jpg|thumb|240px|left|A depiction of George Ballentine, an eyewitness of the battalion]]

The San Patricios used this battle as a chance to settle old scores with U.S. troops. "The large number of officers killed in the affair was ... ascribed to them, as for the gratification of their revenge they aimed at no other objects during the engagement".{{sfn|Ballentine|1860|p=256}} At some point during the fighting for the convent, two American officers led fifteen men against a point in the Mexican defences, and mistook San Patricio members for friendly U.S. army troops; the San Patricios opened fire on them, killing and wounding all but one of the group.{{sfn|McCaffery|1994|p=179}} Though hopelessly outnumbered and under-equipped, the defenders repelled the attacking U.S. forces with heavy losses until their ammunition ran out and a Mexican officer raised the white flag of surrender. Officer Patrick Dalton of the San Patricios tore the white flag down, prompting Gen. [[Pedro María de Anaya|Pedro Anaya]] to order his men to fight on, with their bare hands if necessary.{{sfn|Fogarty|2005}} American Private Ballentine reported that when the Mexicans attempted to raise the [[white flag]] two more times, members of the San Patricios shot and killed them.{{sfn|Ballentine|1860|p=256}}{{sfn|Meltzer|1974|p=197}} After brutal [[Close Quarters Battle|close-quarters]] fighting with [[bayonet]]s and [[Sabre|sabers]] through the halls and rooms inside the convent, U.S. Army [[Captain (land)|Captain]] James M. Smith suggested a surrender after raising his white handkerchief.{{sfn|Nordstrom|2008}} Following the U.S. victory, the Americans "ventilat[ed] their vocabulary of Saxon expletives, not very "courteously," on Riley and his beautiful disciples of St. Patrick."{{sfn|Ramsey|1850|p=299}}

Gen. Anaya stated in his written battle report that 35 San Patricios were killed, 85 taken prisoner (including a wounded John Riley, Captain O'Leary and Anaya); about 85 escaped with retreating Mexican forces.{{sfn|Fogarty|2005}} Some 60% of the San Patricios were killed or captured in the engagement.{{sfn|Miller|1989|p=89}} The survivors were reformed before the [[Battle of Mexico City]] some two weeks later and were stationed at [[Querétaro]] where the Mexican government had decamped, with some 50 members serving as a body-guard for the commander-in-chief.{{sfn|Carpenter|1851|p=102}} The battalion were caught up in the infighting and politicking of Mexico at the time, and were under the patronage of a faction that favored suing for ending of the conflict peacefully.{{sfn|Foos|2002|p=110}} New units were later made up of the free survivors of the battle of Churubusco and a roughly equal number of fresh deserters from the U.S. Army.{{sfn|Nordstrom|2008}}{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=286}} Following the war, the Mexican Government insisted in a clause of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] that the remaining San Patricio prisoners held by the Americans were to be left in Mexico, and Major General [[William Orlando Butler]] issued General Orders 116 on 1 June 1848 stating that; "The prisoners confined at the Citadel, known as the San Patricio prisoners, will be immediately discharged"—[[Drumming out|Rogue’s March]] was played upon their release.{{sfn|Paredes|2010}} The Saint Patrick's battalion continued to function as two infantry companies under the command of John Riley, with one unit tasked with sentry duty in Mexico City and the other was stationed in the suburbs of Guadalupe Hidalgo.{{sfn|Paredes|2010}} The San Patricios were officially mustered out of Mexican military service in 1848; some members were alleged to have been involved in an abortive [[military coup]],{{sfn|Stevens|1999|pp=290–291}} while historians have said the group was disbanded because of Mexican budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.questiaschool.com/read/9635237?title=S|title=The United States in Latin America: A Historical Dictionary, '''S''', p. 311|publisher=[[Questia Online Library]] |website=questiaschool.com |date=|accessdate=2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath of Churubusco==

===Trials===
The San Patricios captured by the U.S. Army were treated and punished as traitors for desertion in time of war. Seventy-two men were immediately charged with desertion by the Army.{{sfn|Howes|2003|p=181}}

Two separate courts-martial were held, one at [[Tacubaya]] on 23 August, and another at [[San Ángel]] on 26 August. At neither of these trials were the men represented by lawyers nor were transcripts made of the proceedings. This lack of formal legal advice could account for the fact that several of the men claimed that drunkenness had led them to desert (a common defense in military trials at the time that sometimes led to lighter sentences), and others described how they were forced to join the Mexican Army in some form or another. The majority of the San Patricios either offered no defense or their defenses were not recorded. Wealthy Mexicans came to the San Patricios' defence at the trials, and members of Mexico's first families visited them in prison.{{sfn|Foos|2002|p=112}}

===Sentences===
One soldier who claimed he was forced to fight by the Mexicans after he was captured by them, and who subsequently refused to do so, was sentenced to death by firing squad instead of hanging, along with another who was found not to have officially joined the Mexican Army.{{sfn|Howes|2003|p=181}}

Most of the convicted San Patricios were sentenced to death by hanging: 30 from the Tacubaya trial and 18 from San Ángel. The rationale was that they had entered Mexican military service following the declaration of war. Execution by hanging was in violation of the contemporary [[Articles of War]], which stipulated that the penalty for desertion and/or defecting to the enemy during a time of war was death by [[firing squad]], regardless of the circumstances. Hanging was reserved only for spies (without uniform) and for "atrocities against civilians", neither of which activities were among the charges brought against any members of the Saint Patricio's Battalion.{{sfn|Hogan|2006}} Although more than 9,000 U.S. soldiers deserted the army during the Mexican–American War, only the San Patricios (who unlike almost all other deserters had also fought against the United States) were punished by hanging.{{sfn|Hogan|1998|p=19}}

Those soldiers who had left military service before the official [[declaration of war]] on Mexico (Riley among them) were sentenced to: {{cquote|...receive 50 lashes on their bare backs, to be branded with the letter ‘D’ for deserter, and to wear iron yokes around their necks for the duration of the war.{{sfn|Frías|1984|p=173}}}}

===Executions===
In all, 50 Saint Patrick's battalion members were officially executed by the U.S. Army. Collectively, this was the largest [[mass execution]] in United States history—the hanging of 38 [[Sioux]] at the conclusion of the [[Dakota War of 1862#Execution|Dakota War of 1862]] appears to be the largest execution by hanging at a single event. En masse executions for [[treason]] took place at three separate locations on three separate dates; 16 were executed on 10 September 1847 at San Ángel, four were executed the following day at the village of Mixcoac on 11 September, and 30 were hanged at [[Chapultepec]] on 13 September.{{sfnm|1a1=McCaffery|1y=1994|1p=196|2a1=Eisenhower|2y=1999|2p=297}} A sole San Patricio was murdered by American soldiers when he was recognised among the prisoners of war in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Molino del Rey]], by being thrown "into a mill flume and crushed by the wheel".{{sfn|McCaffery|1994|p=181}} At the San Ángel hangings all prisoners were executed without incident except for Patrick Dalton, who, as an American captain described, was "literally choked to death".{{sfn|Miller|1989|p=105}} Dalton had previously voiced concerns regarding his treatment.{{sfn|Miller|1989|p=93}} By order of Gen. [[Winfield Scott]], thirty San Patricios were to be executed at Chapultepec in full view of the two armies while they fought the [[Battle of Chapultepec]], at the precise moment that the flag of the U.S. replaced the flag of Mexico atop the citadel. This order was carried out by Col. [[William Harney]].{{sfn|Hogan|2006}} Harney was taunted and jeered by the condemned men.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|p=297}} While overseeing the hangings, Harney ordered Francis O'Connor hanged even though he had had both legs amputated the previous day. When the army surgeon informed the colonel that the absent soldier had lost both his legs in battle, Harney replied:
{{cquote|Bring the damned son of a bitch out! My order was to hang 30 and by God I'll do it!{{sfn|Wunn|1984|p=14}}}}
[[File:Sanpatricioshang.jpg|thumb|270px|right|The mass hanging of San Patricios, as portrayed by [[Samuel Chamberlain]], c. 1867]]

The U.S. flag appeared on the flagpole at 9.30 a.m. As legend has it, the Mexican flag had been taken by cadet {{ill|Juan Escutia|es}} of the [[Niños Héroes]] to his death after leaping with it from [[Chapultepec Castle]] to deny the Americans the honor of capturing it. In a final act of defiance, the men about to be hanged cheered the [[Mexican flag]], as one onlooker remarked; "Hands tied, feet tied, their voices still free".{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=275}} At Harney's signal, the carts holding the tied and noosed men pulled away.{{sfn|Hogan|1998|p=287}} Harney refused to cut the bodies down, stating that "I was ordered to have them hanged, and have no orders to ''unhang'' them";{{sfn|McCaffery|1994|p=197}} Harney was subsequently promoted to brigadier general, a post which he held while the U.S. Army occupied Mexico City. The Mexican government described the hangings as "a cruel death or horrible torments, improper in a civilized age, and [ironic] for a people who aspire to the title of illustrious and humane",{{sfn|Downey|1955}} and by a writer covering the war as "a refinement of cruelty and ... fiendish".{{sfn|Fast|1993}} George Ballentine remarked in his account of his American military service in Mexico that "The desertion of our soldiers to the Mexican army ... were still numerous, in spite of the fearful example of the executions at Churubusco, [and] also served to inspire that party with hope".{{sfn|Ballentine|1860|p=281}}

==Legacy==
Those who survived either made lives for themselves in Mexico or returned to their home nations such as Ireland. Some former San Patricios found work at the arsenal in [[Guadalajara]] making [[stock (firearms)|gun stocks]].{{sfn|Carpenter|1851|p=212}} One former San Patricio, an Irishman, started a military academy teaching "the sword exercise", also in Guadalajara.{{sfn|Carpenter|1851|pp=207–208}} Others were reportedly killed while travelling through Mexico,{{sfn|Carpenter|1851|p=201}} while others were reduced to living on handouts.{{sfn|Foos|2002|p=111}} A handful are on record as having made use of the land claims promised them by the Mexican government. Americans in Mexico who had been taken prisoner by Mexico or who were common deserters were known to falsely present themselves as members of the Saint Patrick's Battalion; American William W. Carpenter, who found himself in this predicament, stated that: "the reputation of the San Patricio battalion was spread from ocean to ocean, and to that, more than any thing else, do I owe my present safety".{{sfn|Carpenter|1851|p=135}}

The men have continued to be honored and revered as heroes in Mexico.{{sfn|Gonzales|2000|pp=86–87}} The ''Batallón de San Patricio'' is memorialised on two separate days; 12 September, the generally accepted anniversary of the executions of those battalion members captured by the U.S. Army, and 17 March, [[Saint Patrick's Day]]. Numerous schools, churches and other landmarks in Mexico take their name from the battalion, including:
* Monterrey – The street in front of the Irish School is named ''Batallón de San Patricio'' ("Battalion of Saint Patrick").
* Mexico City – The street in front of the Santa María de [[Churubusco]] convent was named ''Mártires Irlandeses'' ("the Irish martyrs").
* The Wall of Honor in Mexico's [[Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|Chamber of Deputies]] – On Thursday, 28 October 2002 the LVII Mexican Congress held a ceremony where the inscription "''Defensores de la Patria 1846-1848 y Batallón de San Patricio''" [Defenders of the Motherland 1846-1848 and the San Patricio Battalion] was inscribed in gold letters.{{sfn|Paredes|2010}}{{sfn|Hawley|2008}}
* ''[http://bandadegaitas.mx Banda de Gaitas del Batallon de San Patricio]'' [The St. Patrick's Battalion Pipes &amp; Drums] – The only Bagpipe Band in Mexico is named after the battalion. The band is based at the former Convent of Churubusco in Mexico City, which now houses the Museum of Foreign Interventions or "''Museo Nacional de las Intervenciones''". The band was inducted into the [[Irish America Hall of Fame]] in 2013.{{sfn|Looby|2015}}
* San Patricio station – [[Metro Zapata]] was renamed for one day to "San Patricio" on 17 March 2015 to commemorate Saint Patrick's day and the Saint Patrick's battalion. This was the first time a metro had been renamed in such a manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merrionstreet.ie/en/Gallery/Images/Mexico_City_renames_Metro_Station_after_St_Patrick_for_one_day.html |title=Mexico City renames Metro Station after St Patrick for one day |website=Merrionstreet.com |publisher=Irish Government News Service |date=17 March 2015 |accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S. the memory of the battalion has been different. In Winfield Scott's 1852 run for president of the United States, his treatment of the San Patricios was brought up by his opponents to sway Irish American voters.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|p=329}} The U.S. Army long denied the existence of the Saint Patrick's battalion as a [[cover-up]] and attempt to discourage other deserters.  In 1915 an [[inquiry]] was initiated by U.S. [[congressmen]] [[William Henry Coleman]] and [[Frank L. Greene]]. This resulted in the U.S. Army's admitting its denial of the matter. The U.S. Congress ordered the army to turn over its records on the battalion to the National Archives.{{sfn|Stevens|1999|pp=300–301}} In 1999, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] cancelled the U.S. distribution of a film depicting the battalion, ''[[One Man's Hero]]''.{{sfn|Rollins|2008|p=91–92}}

In 1997, President [[Ernesto Zedillo]] commemorated the 150th anniversary of the execution of the San Patricios at a ceremony in Mexico City's San Jacinto Plaza. This is where the U.S. Army conducted the first 16 hangings after the men were convicted of desertion at court martial. [[Ireland]] and Mexico [[joint issue|jointly issued]] commemorative postage stamps to mark the anniversary.

In 2004, at an official ceremony attended by numerous international dignitaries including directors Lance and Jason Hool, as well as several actors from the film ''[[One Man's Hero]]'' (1999), the Mexican government gave a commemorative statue to the Irish government in perpetual thanks for the bravery, honor and sacrifice of the Saint Patrick's Battalion. The statue was erected in [[Clifden]], Connemara, Ireland, where leader John Riley was born. In honor of [[John Riley (soldier)|John Riley]], on 12 September the town of [[Clifden]] flies the [[Mexican flag]]. In 2014, [[Sinn Féin]]  named a [[cumann]] in Clifden in honor of John O'Reilly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/73462/mexican-irish-hero-to-be-honoured-in-clifden |title=Mexican-Irish hero to be honoured in Clifden |work=[[Galway Advertiser]] |date=6 November 2014 |accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33144">The United States Department of Justice defines '''School resource officers''' (SRO) as “sworn [[Peace officer|law enforcement officers]] responsible for safety and crime prevention in schools.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cops.usdoj.gov/supportingsafeschools|title=COPS Office: SRO|last=IT|first=COPS Office|website=cops.usdoj.gov|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; SROs are typically employed by a local [[police]] or [[sheriff]]'s agency and work closely with administrators in an effort to create a safer environment for both students and staff. The responsibilities of SROs are similar to regular police officers in that they have the ability to make arrests, respond to calls for service, and document incidents. School resource officers typically have additional duties, including mentoring and conducting presentations on youth-related issues. SROs are not synonymous with school based law enforcement (SBLE) officers - which are typically employed by a school district's law enforcement agency, rather than local or city law enforcement - though they are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://txssc.txstate.edu/topics/law-enforcement/articles/brief-history|title=A Brief History of School-Based Law Enforcement {{!}} Texas School Safety Center|website=txssc.txstate.edu|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is primarily about SROs in the United States, though there are also SROs in Canada. In Australia, they are called Police School Liaison Officers and only exist at High School level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.police.nsw.gov.au/safety_and_prevention/your_community/young_people_and_youth_issues/youth_accordian/school_liaison_police|title=School Liaison Police - NSW Police Public Site|website=www.police.nsw.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== United States ===
The first documented SRO was placed in a school in [[Flint, Michigan]] in 1953. School.&lt;ref name="IFO Article URL"/&gt;  However, the topic was not broadly discussed until 1968, when the [[Fresno, California]] Police Department looked to the school resource officer program as a tool to “revitalize its image in the eyes of its youth”.&lt;ref name="IFO Article URL"/&gt;  This early adaptation of the program involved placing plainclothes officers in the middle and elementary schools to foster a relationship between the local police department and the youth, which continues to be a goal of the program.&lt;ref name="IFO Article URL"/&gt; Since the 1970s, the role of SROs has shifted from mentorship/education to crime prevention and law enforcement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PF_IssueBriefs_Defining-the-Role-of-School-Based-Police-Officers_FINAL.pdf|title=Defining the Role of School-Based Police Officers|last=Police Foundation|first=|date=2016|website=Police Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s-90s, SROs facilitated crime prevention programs, such as [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education]] (D.A.R.E.) and [[Gang Resistance Education and Training]] (G.R.E.A.T.).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From the mid-1970s to 2008, the number of schools with police stationed on campus rose from approximately 1 percent to 40 percent."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/opinion/criminalizing-children-at-school.html ''Criminalizing Children at School'', The New York Times].&lt;/ref&gt;  In many states SROs are the main enforcers and interpreters of the states' [[school disturbance laws]].

Although Fresno’s program began with non-uniformed officers, it has progressed into what is seen in most communities today: a uniformed officer operating a marked police vehicle, who is responsible for safety and security on the school property. This came after the federal [[Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994]] passed by Congress in response to the country’s fear of juvenile and gang violence. As a result, schools created expansive “zero tolerance” policies that were enforced by an increasing presence of uniformed SROs on campus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the late 1990s, SRO presence on campuses again increased after the Department of Justice created a $750 million grant program, Cops in School,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to hire over 6,500 SROs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Na|first=Chongmin|last2=Gottfredson|first2=Denise|date=October 3, 2011|title=Police Officers in School: Effects on School Crime and the Processing of Offending Behaviors|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2011.615754|journal=Justice Quarterly|volume=30|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Like the United States, many secondary schools in Canada have hired security personnel to enhance the safety of staff and students. School systems, such as in [[Toronto]], have engaged armed police officers to be in the school throughout the day.  In 2008, the [[Toronto District School Board]] (TDSB) and the [[Toronto Catholic District School Board]] (TCDSB), in collaboration with the [[Toronto Police Service]], institutionalized the SRO Program by permanently placing armed, uniformed police officers in secondary schools. However, in November 2017 the TDSB voted to eliminate the district's SRO program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tdsb.on.ca/News/Article-Details/ArtMID/474/ArticleID/1153/Trustees-Vote-to-End-School-Resource-Officer-Program-at-TDSB|title=Trustees Vote to End School Resource Officer Program at TDSB|website=Toronto District School Board|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
Different governments, school districts, and professional agencies have varied descriptions for the purpose of SROs. The National Association for School Resource Officers details the SRO's role as threefold: 1) as an educator, 2) as an informal counselor or mentor and 3) as a law enforcement officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nasro.org/frequently-asked-questions/|title=Frequently Asked Questions - National Association of School Resource Officers|work=National Association of School Resource Officers|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The United States Department of Justice includes those three prongs, and adds 4) an emergency manager or planner for a school or district.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Technology in Education aggregated SROs’ job descriptions across the country and identified seven comprehensive purposes for an SRO, including 1) provide law enforcement and investigation, 2) develop crime prevention programs, 3) training and securing school personnel, 4) establish a working relationship with school and students, 5) develop classes related to position, 6) assist students in conflict resolution, and 7) be a positive role model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cte.jhu.edu/courses/ssn/sro/ses1_act4_pag1.shtml|title=CTE - The Role of the School Resource Officer: SRO Definition - School Resource Officer Job Description|website=cte.jhu.edu|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, SROs’ are managed by different institutions depending on their location. At school, most SROs are treated as staff and report to the principal or other school administrators. When not at school, they are often managed by a law enforcement agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiernan Coon|first=Julie|last2=Travis III|first2=Lawrence|date=October 13, 2011|title=The role of police in public schools: a comparison of principal and police reports of activities in schools|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15614263.2011.589570|journal=Police Practice and Research|volume=13|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1080/15614263.2011.589570|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crime prevention ===
Crime prevention is as a major component of being an SRO. However, critics suggest that putting more efforts into creating a safe environment through school related programs would be equally or even more effective in reducing crime. Between 2003 and 2007 there was an 8.9 percent decrease in the number of SROs in the United States  but no increase in the number of reported offenses.&lt;ref name="Arrest" /&gt;

It is also believed that incidents in schools with SROs are under reported because [[school administrators]] or teachers will often simply contact the SRO when assistance is needed, reducing the number of calls received by 911 call centers.&lt;ref name="Uchida" /&gt;

=== SECURe rubric ===
The  Safe School-based Enforcement through Collaboration, Understanding, and Respect (SECURe) rubrics were created through a partnership of the United States Department of Education and Department of Justice. SECURe provides plans for initiating or improving SRO/law enforcement relationships with schools.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{DoJ}}{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/files/sro-local-implementation-rubric.pdf|title=Local Implementation Rubric|last=Department of Education|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SECURe identifies five action items for schools and law enforcement agencies to collaborate:
# “Create sustainable partnerships and formalize Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) among school districts, local law enforcement agencies, juvenile justice entities, and civil rights and community stakeholders.
# Ensure that MOUs meet constitutional and statutory civil rights requirements.
# Recruit and hire effective SROs and school personnel.
# Keep SROs and school personnel well trained.
# Continually evaluate SROs and school personnel, and recognize good performance.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Outcomes ==

=== Prominence ===
In the 2015-16 school year, the following percentages of schools reported having one or more SROs at their school at least once per week:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017122.pdf|title=Crime, Violence, Discipline, and Safety in U.S. Public Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 77% of schools with 1000 or more students
* 47% of schools with 500-999 students
* 36% of schools with 300-499 students
* 24% of schools with fewer than 300 students
Overall, 42% of public schools host an SRO and an additional 10.9% host a sworn law enforcement officer, as of 2016. In towns (defined as a territory within an urban cluster) have the highest concentration of SROs as 57% of schools in towns host at least one SRO. This is compared to 45% of suburban schools and 36% of city schools. Almost a third of public schools that host an SRO are more than 80% black, while less than 42% of the schools that host an SRO are majority white.

=== Juvenile crime reduction ===
It is difficult to tell if the presence of SROs is having an impact on the prevalence of crime in schools and communities, likely because it is difficult to show a causal relationship between the presence of law enforcement and crime rates. For example, in a 2018 study that compared Kentucky high schools that hosted an SRO to Kentucky high schools that did not, there was no statistically significant relationship between reported criminal violation rates and the presence of an SRO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=icBIDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA884&amp;dq=SULLIVAN,+W.+J.,+&amp;+HAUSMAN,+C.+S.+(2018).+Kentucky+High+Schools+With+SROs+and+Without.+JSL+Vol+27-N6,+27,+884.&amp;ots=dq6yIZmL9w&amp;sig=KxwaklOVFi0YczMw2prUVBFr7pY#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=JSL Vol 27-N6|last=LEADERSHIP|first=JOURNAL OF SCHOOL|date=2018-01-22|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781475836769|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2013 study that analyzed data across the United States found that schools that increase their use of police see an increase in reported crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Na|first=Chongmin|date=October 3, 2011|title=Police Officers in Schools: Effects on School Crime and the Processing of Offending Behaviors|url=|journal=Justice Quarterly|volume=30|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conclusion aligns more closely with intuition because one of the stated goals of SROs is to develop better relationships between students, staff, and police officers which could mean that students and staff would be more comfortable reporting criminal activity to an officer.

A 2012 report from the National Association of School Resource Officers sites national statistics that show a general decrease in juvenile crime and the violent-crime index since the early 2000s, when SROs became especially prominent in schools.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nasro.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/NASRO-To-Protect-and-Educate-nosecurity.pdf|title=The School Resource Officer and the Prevention of Violence in Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They support this claim with a 2009 study that finds that “when the results were controlled for economic disadvantage, the presence of an SRO led to a 52.3% decrease in the arrest rate for assaults and a 72.9% decrease in arrests involving possession of a weapon on school property.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theriot|first=Matthew|date=2009|title=School resource officers and the criminalization of student behavior|url=|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|volume=37|pages=280–287|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this is true, having an SRO in the school also significantly increases the arrest rate for disorderly conduct, even when controlling for school poverty, a more subjective charge that relies considerably on the discretion of the arresting officer, as opposed to something like an assault or weapons charge that it much more objective. This result lends itself to the idea that the presence of an SRO may increase the criminalization of behaviors that could have been addressed in other ways. Further, the decrease in arrests for assault and weapon possession could be from a result of students avoiding the SROs and taking these activities off campus, not necessarily the result of them failing to commit these crimes at all. In another article, James Swift also refers to the report prepared by the Justice Policy Institute. His writing further indicates that the presence of school resource officers does not lead to a reduction in crime.&lt;ref name="Justice URL" /&gt;

This is a similar problem with associating the presence of SROs with the decline in crime rates, overall. There are too many contributing factors to the occurrence of crime to draw a causal relationship between the presence of law enforcement and the crime rate.

=== Teaching and mentorship ===
A 2017 study combined crime data from the U.S. Department of Education and interviews with 20 SROs to better understand how officers are spending their time between teaching, mentorship, and law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Caitlin Grace|date=Summer 2017|title=School Resource Officers and the School-to-Prison Pipeline: A Mixed Methods Application of the Behavior of Law in Schools|url=https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.ca/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1013&amp;context=sociology_criminaljustice_etds|journal=Sociology &amp; Criminal Justice Theses &amp; Dissertations |volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the study finds that while 75% of SROs perform law enforcement functions, only about half of SROs perform teaching or mentorship functions. The performance of these functions were also different based on the racial make-up and socio-economic status of the students at the schools. For example, at schools with students of lower socio-economic statuses, while SROs engaged in more mentorship than at schools with wealthier students, they also were more involved in school discipline and implemented more laws than at wealthier schools. The findings also indicated that SROs perform more law enforcement functions as the percentage of white students increase.

It is important to note that this information comes from a single study, so more research is needed to draw significant conclusions on SRO teaching and mentorship.

=== Financial costs ===
A 2011 report from the Justice Policy Institute considered the cost of SROs as compared to other full time employees at secondary schools.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/educationunderarrest_fullreport.pdf|title=Education Under Arrest: The Case Against Police in Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An SRO is paid at the rate of a police detective, which in 2011 was paid an average of $63,294 per year. This salary was more than both the average teacher’s salary and average school counselor’s salary in 2011. Opponents of SROs often cite this as a reason to not employ an SRO, as it may strain an already tight school budget. However, in some cases, law enforcement agencies have been known to split the cost of employing an SRO with the district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=May|first=David|date=September 28, 2011|title=School Resource Officers in Financial Crisis: Which Programs Get Cut and Why|url=|journal=Journal of Police Crisis Negotiations|volume=11|pages=125–140|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also grant opportunities available through the Community Oriented Policing Solutions office under the Department of Justice. Those grants made their first major impact in 2000 when the grants provided money to employee almost 600 School resource officers in 289 different communities.

== Law and policy ==

=== Memorandums of Understanding ===
Because SROs are responsible for a number of tasks outside of normal duties for law enforcement officials, it has become common practice to establish a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the school district and the local law enforcement agency. These MOUs tend to vary in content based on the needs of the school district, but common ideas include the specified mission of the SRO, the organizational structure, and goals and procedures for the SRO. Other MOUs are more specific and include day-to-day duties of the SRO, where the SRO would be located in the school building, how an SRO will be selected, who is responsible for training, and chain-of-command issues. The National Association of School Resource Officers provides a helpful guideline and questions that should be reflected in an MOU to ensure the safety of students and to guard against legal action that could be taken against the law enforcement agency and/or the school.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

MOUs often fall short{{According to whom|date=March 2018}} in clearly defining the school’s role and the SRO’s role in student discipline and maintaining a safe environment. As a result, an SRO may find himself/herself making decisions in the moment that disrupt the balance between student safety and students’ rights. Kimberly Small, Assistant General Counsel for the Illinois Association of School Boards, recommends specifying policies, in line with applicable laws, on issues of “search and seizure, questioning of students, and requests for student records.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iasb.com/law/NSBAImprovingMOUForSRO2014.pdf|title=IMPROVING MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING FOR SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER SERVICES|last=Small|first=Kimberly|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Federal policies ===
While the federal government does not have specific laws regarding the use of SROs, the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice created the Safe School-based Enforcement through Collaboration, Understanding, and Respect (SECURe) rubrics to help provide guidance to school districts.

Students can, however, file civil rights claims against School Resource Officers. Kerrin Wolf, an Assistant Professor of Law at Stockton University, reviewed a series of Supreme Court decisions that have shaped the federal civil rights of students while in school. In her paper, she explores the ways in which students’ rights are limited in three dimensions while in school: rights against search and seizure, interrogation rights, and free speech rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Kerrin|date=2017-09-15|title=Assessing Students' Civil Rights Claims against School Resource Officers|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3042765|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Search and Seizure: [[New Jersey v. T. L. O.|New Jersey v. T.L.O.]] loosened probable cause requirements for school officials in two ways: it required less evidence to justify a search and a school official can suspect a student of breaking a law or a school policy, which covers significantly more actions than just breaking a law. Vernonia School District v. Acton and Board of Education of Pottowatamie School District v. Earls further expanded schools’ ability to search students by allowing for random drug testing for all students involved in extracurricular activities. However, [[Safford Unified School District#1 v. Redding]] placed some restrictions on schools by identifying strip searches as too intrusive. Courts remain divided regarding the question of whether school resource officers need probable cause or reasonable suspicion to conduct a search of a student on school grounds because they are agents of a law enforcement agency, not school officials.
* Interrogation: In State v. Barrett, the Louisiana court found that a Miranda warning was not required by a school official to question a student. As far as how this requirement extends to SROs, In the matter of V.P found that Miranda warnings are not required in an investigation involving an SRO if a school administrator performs the questioning. In re Marquita M. took it a step further by claiming that holding a student in a school office for questioning does not qualify as “in custody” (and, therefore, requires a Miranda warning) because it is not a threatening environment, like a police station, where coercion could occur.
* Free Speech: In Tinker v. Des Moines Community Independent School District, the court upheld two students’ right to wear black armbands in protest of the Vietnam War. Since that case, however, free speech for students in schools has been diminished. In subsequent cases, courts have allowed schools to limit speech that they consider to be disruptive or counter to the pedagogical mission of the school.

=== State laws ===
Only eight U.S. states currently have laws on the books regarding School Resource Officers and/or police in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://safesupportivelearning.ed.gov/discipline-compendium/choose-state/results?field_sub_category_value=Certification+or+training|title=School Discipline Laws &amp; Regulations by Category &amp; State {{!}} Safe Supportive Learning|website=safesupportivelearning.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, these laws only cover the definition of an SRO and mandate training. However, in November 2016, New Jersey signed into law Bill S86, which allows schools to hire retired law enforcement officers as SROs under the condition that they receive no benefits, can work full-time hours, are no older than age 65, and retired within three years of application to the SRO program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://legiscan.com/NJ/bill/S86/2016|title=New Jersey S86 {{!}} 2016-2017 {{!}} Regular Session|work=LegiScan|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

=== Excessive force ===
There have also been a number of incidents in the United States in which school resource officers and/or police officers called into schools are reported to have used excessive force against students. Some of those incidents include:
* In May 2017, an in-school police officer with the Dallas Independent School District (ISD) allegedly handcuffed and tasered a 7-year-old special needs student and, in that same week, another in-school officer at another Dallas ISD reportedly body-slammed and pepper sprayed a 12-year-old female student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thinkprogress.org/dallas-police-schools-violence-kids-fd6cd565a8c0/|title=Dallas school police tased a 7 year old, and then body slammed a 12 year old the next day|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2015, a police officer was filmed body-slamming a 16-year-old girl at her desk in Spring Valley High School in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/video-appears-show-cop-body-slamming-student-s-c-classroom-n451896|title=Video Shows Cop Body-Slamming Female Student in S.C. Classroom|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also in October 2015, two police officers were called into Round Rock High School in Texas to break up a fight between students. Students filmed one of the officers choking one of the 14-year-old students involved in the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cbsaustin.com/news/local/incident-between-round-rock-pd-officer-and-student-caught-on-camera|title=Incident between Round Rock PD officers and student caught on camera|last=Uchida|first=Alex Boyér and Adela|work=KEYE|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A school resource officer for Tolman High School in Rhode Island fell under investigation in 2015 for body-slamming a 14-year-old student, leading to massive protests the following day over the SRO's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20151015/NEWS/151019570|title=State police to probe 'takedown' of student by officer that led to protest, arrests at Pawtucket school|last=Staff|first=Journal|work=providencejournal.com|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August 2015, the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] filed a lawsuit against a Kentucky school for allowing a school resource officer to handcuff an 8-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl, both of whom had special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/us/aclu-sues-over-handcuffing-of-boy-8-and-girl-9-in-kentucky-school.html|title=A.C.L.U. Sues Over Handcuffing of Boy, 8, and Girl, 9, in Kentucky School|last=Stolberg|first=Sheryl Gay|date=2015-08-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These incidents are among many that have caused significant concern over the ability of schools to control the actions of school resource officers and other police officers when they are asked to intervene in student conflicts.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}
SRO's are not governed by the school board. They are controlled by the laws of the state in which they work and their agencies policies and procedures. When the law is broken by a perpetrator and there is a victim of a crime, charges must be brought. It is not the choice of school staff whether a law enforcement officer can act in filing charges.

===Increasing arrests of juveniles===
Student Resource Officers are becoming more commonplace in American and Canadian schools, leading to increasing concerns that their presence in secondary schools could prematurely expose adolescents to the Criminal Justice System.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; School districts across the United States are implementing criminal justice system practices in order to achieve a safe schooling environment; however, this comes at the cost of exposing youth/adolescents to the criminal justice system and tarnishing their educational achievements for situations that in the past would likely have been handled through disciplinary action within the school.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This is seen by some{{Like whom?|date=March 2018}} as contributing to the [[school to prison pipeline]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/01/30/are-school-resource-officers-part-of-the-school-to-prison-pipeline-problem ''School Resource Officers: Safety Priority or Part of the Problem?'', Tierney Sneed, USA Today, Jan. 30, 2015].  Retrieved 2017-12-03&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of school resource officer programs pertains to the rate of juvenile arrests. In a 2011 article by Amanda Petteruti issued by the Justice Policy Institute, information is presented that indicates that school referrals to the juvenile justice system have increased with the presence of SROs. A high percentage of those referrals were for minor offenses that may have been handled by the administration had an SRO not been present. This concern has attracted attention and some studies indicate that the use of the [[Juvenile justice system|Juvenile Justice System]] for minor offenses aids in a phenomenon known as the "[[School to prison pipeline|School to Prison Pipeline]]" (pg. 13).&lt;ref name="Arrest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thesis" /&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) suggests that SRO programs should be designed to provide a different response for disciplinary matters as opposed to criminal offenses that occur on school grounds. This recommendation was intended to ensure that juveniles were not receiving disparate treatment based upon the presence of a law enforcement officer within their school.&lt;ref name="ACLU"/&gt;

=== Effectiveness ===
The February 14, 2018 shooting which killed 17 people at [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting|Stoneman Douglas High School]] brought renewed attention to the topic of police in schools. The police officer assigned to the school resigned shortly after the shooting under criticism of not entering the school building while the student was shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/parkland/florida-school-shooting/fl-florida-shooting-sro-20180222-story.html|title=Stoneman Douglas cop resigns; sheriff says he should have 'killed the killer'|last=Huriash|first=Stephen Hobbs, Scott Travis, Lisa J.|work=Sun-Sentinel.com|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the frequency with which [[List of school shootings in the United States|school shootings]] occur in the United States, critics of SRO programs are asking if it is necessary to have armed police officers in schools, if they cannot ensure students' safety during crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blad|first1=Evie|title=Impact of School Police: Many Unanswered Questions|journal=Education Week|date=25 January 2017|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/01/25/impact-of-school-police-many-unanswered-questions.html|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shooter in Maryland's [[Great Mills High School]] attack on March 20, 2018, was neutralized following swift action by the school's resource officer, Blaine Gaskill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = CNN| first = Carma Hassan and Saeed Ahmed| title = Lone resource officer's quick action stopped the Maryland school shooter within seconds| work = CNN| accessdate = 2018-03-21| url = https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/us/maryland-school-shooting-resource-officer-response-trnd/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As CNN put it: "Gaskill's response was hailed as an example of exactly what a resource officer is supposed to do in such a circumstance, particularly when contrasted to the actions of the security officer in last month's shooting in Parkland, Florida."

'''Sergey Gennadiyevich Nechayev''' (or Nyechayev; {{lang-ru|Серге́й Генна́диевич Неча́ев}}) (October 2, 1847 – November 21 or December 3, 1882) was a Russian [[revolutionary]] associated with the [[Nihilist movement]] and known for his single-minded pursuit of revolution by any means necessary, including [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Maegd-Soëp | first = Carolina | title = Trifonov and the Drama of the Russian Intelligentsia | publisher = Ghent State University, Russian Institute | year = 1990 | isbn = 90-73139-04-X |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nechayev, [http://www.hist.msu.ru/ER/Etext/nechaev.htm ''Катехизис революционера''], publisher's preface, from: '' Революционный радикализм в России: век девятнадцатый. Документальная публикация.'' Ed. Е.Л.Рудницкая Moscow, Археографический центр, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of the radical ''[[Catechism of a Revolutionary]].''

He fled Russia in 1869 after having been involved in the murder of a former comrade. Complicated relationships with fellow revolutionaries caused him to be expelled from the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]].  Arrested in Switzerland in 1872, he was sent back to Russia, received a 20-year sentence and died in prison.

The character Pyotr Verkhovensky in [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]]'s [[anti-nihilistic novel]], ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]'', is based on Nechayev.

==Early life in Russia==
[[File:Дом Нечаева.png|thumb|The house in which Nechaev was born and lived until 1862]]
Sergey Nechayev was born in [[Ivanovo]], then a small textile town, to poor parents—his father was a waiter and sign painter. His mother died when he was eight. His father remarried and had two more sons. They lived in a three-room house with his two sisters and grandparents. They were ex [[serfs]] who had moved to Ivanovo. He had already developed an awareness of [[social inequality]] and a resentment of the local nobility in his youth. At 10, Sergey had learned his father's trades—waiting at banquets and painting signs. His father got him a job as an errand boy in a factory, but Sergey refused the servant's job. His family paid for good tutors who taught him Latin, German, French, History, Maths and Rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Siljak, Angel of Vengeance, page 90&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865 at age 18, Nechayev moved to [[Moscow]], where he worked for the historian [[Mikhael Pogodin]]. A year later, he moved to [[St. Petersburg]], passed a teacher's exam and began teaching at a [[parish]] school. From September 1868, Nechayev attended lectures at [[St. Petersburg University]] (as an [[auditor]], he was never enrolled) and became acquainted with the subversive Russian literature of the [[Decembrists]], the [[Petrashevsky Circle]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]], among others, as well as the growing student unrest at the university. Nechaev was even said to have slept on bare wood and lived on black bread in imitation of Rakhmetov, the ascetic revolutionary in [[Chernyshevsky]]'s novel ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Michael Drozd, Chernyshevskii's What is to be done?: a reevaluation, page 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the failed attempt on the Tsar's life by [[Dmitry Karakozov|Karakozov]], Nechayev participated in student activism in 1868–1869, leading a [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] [[minority group|minority]] with [[Petr Tkachev]] and others. Nechayev took part in devising this student movement's "Program of revolutionary activities", which stated later a social [[revolution]] as its ultimate goal. The program also suggested ways for creating a revolutionary organization and conducting subversive activities. In particular, the program envisioned composition of the  ''[[Catechism of a Revolutionary]]'', for which Nechayev would become famous.[[Image:Young Nechayev.jpg|thumb|Nechayev in 1865.]]
In December 1868 he met [[Vera Zasulich]] (who would make an assassination attempt on General [[Fyodor Trepov (senior)|Trepov]], governor of [[St. Petersburg]] in 1878) at a teachers' meeting. He asked her to come to his school where he held candlelit readings of revolutionary tracts. He would place pictures of [[Robespierre]] and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] on the table while reading.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Siljak, Angel of Vengeance, page 93&lt;/ref&gt; At these meetings he plotted to assassinate the Tsar on the 9th anniversary of [[Abolition of serfdom in Russia|serfdom's abolition]].

The last of these student meetings occurred on January 28, 1869. Nechayev presented a petition calling for freedom of assembly for students.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Siljak, Angel of Vengeance, page 97&lt;/ref&gt; 97 did, though he wouldn't say what he'd do with the petition. Two days later, he handed it to the police, intending to radicalize the students through prison and exile.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==The Geneva exiles==
In January 1869, Nechayev spread false rumors of his arrest in St. Petersburg, then left for Moscow before heading abroad. He tried to get Zasulich to emigrate with him by declaring love for her, yet she refused.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Siljak, Angel of Vengeance, page 98&lt;/ref&gt; He sent her a letter claiming to have been arrested. In [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], he pretended to be a representative of a revolutionary [[committee]] who had fled from the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], and he won the confidence of revolutionary-in-exile [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (who called him 'my boy')&lt;ref&gt;Ana Siljak, Angel of Vengeance, page 101&lt;/ref&gt; and his friend and collaborator [[Nikolai Ogarev]]. Ogarev, on Bakunin's suggestion, dedicated a poem to Nechayev:

:THE STUDENT ''(To my young friend Nechaev)''
:He was born to a wretched fate
:And taught in a hard school,
:And suffered interminable torments
:In years of unceasing labor.
:But as the years swept by
:His love for the people grew stronger
:And fiercer his thirst for the common good
:The thirst to improve man's fate.

Bakunin saw in Nechayev the authentic voice of Russian youth, which he regarded as "the most revolutionary in the world". He would hold onto this idealised vision long after his association with Nechayev became damaging to him.

Ogarev, Bakunin and Nechayev organized a [[propaganda]] [[Advertising campaign|campaign]] of subversive material to be sent to Russia, financed by Ogarev from the so-called "Bakhmetiev Fund", which had been intended for subsidizing their own revolutionary activities. [[Alexander Herzen]] disliked Nechayev's fanaticism and strongly opposed the campaign, believing Nechayev was influencing Bakunin toward more extreme rhetoric. However, Herzen relented to hand over much of the fund to Nechayev, which he was to take to Russia to mobilise support for the revolution.
Nechayev had a list of 387 people who were sent 560 parcels of leaflets for distribution April–August 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Siljak, Angel of Vengeance, page 111&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was that the activists would be caught, punished and radicalized. Amongst these people was Vera Zasulich, who got five years exile because of a crudely coded letter sent by Nechayev.

==''Catechism of a Revolutionary''==
In late spring 1869, Nechayev wrote ''[[Catechism of a Revolutionary]]'', a program for the "merciless destruction" of society and the state. The main principle of the "[[Catechism]]"—"[[the ends justify the means]]"—became Nechayev's [[slogan]] throughout his revolutionary career. He saw ruthless immorality in the pursuit of total control by Church and State, and believed that the struggle against them must therefore be carried out by any means necessary, with an unwavering focus on their destruction. The individual self is to be subsumed by a greater purpose in a kind of spiritual [[asceticism]], which for Nechayev was far more than just a theory, but the guiding principle by which he lived his life. According to the ''Catechism'',
{{quote|A revolutionary is a doomed man. He has no private interests, no affairs, sentiments, ties, property nor even a name of his own. His entire being is devoured by one purpose, one thought, one passion – the revolution. Heart and soul, not merely by word but by deed, he has severed every link with the social order and with the entire civilized world; with the laws, good manners, conventions, and morality of that world. He is its merciless enemy and continues to inhabit it with only one purpose – to destroy it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A revolutionary "must infiltrate all social formations including the police. He must exploit rich and influential people, subordinating them to himself. He must aggravate the miseries of the common people, so as to exhaust their patience and incite them to rebel. And, finally, he must ally himself with the savage word of the violent criminal, the only true revolutionary in Russia".&lt;ref name="Radzinsky"&gt;[[Edvard Radzinsky]] ''Stalin : The First In-depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives'' (1997) {{ISBN|0-385-47954-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The book was to influence generations of radicals, and was re-published by the [[Black Panther Party]] in 1969 – one hundred years after its original publication. It also influenced the formation of the militant [[Red Brigades]] in Italy the same year.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Return to Russia==
Having left Russia illegally, Nechayev had to sneak back to Moscow via Romania in August 1869 with help from Bakunin's underground contacts. On the way he met [[Christo Botev]], a [[Bulgaria]]n revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Siljak, Angel of Vengeance, page 120&lt;/ref&gt; In Moscow he lived an austere life, spending the fund only on political activities. He pretended to be a proxy of the Russian department of the "Worldwide Revolutionary Union" (which didn't exist) and created an [[wikt:affiliate|affiliate]] of a secret society called "People's Reprisal Society" (Общество народной расправы); it issued the magazine ''Narodnaya Rasprava'' (Народная расправа, "People's Reprisal"). He claimed that the society had existed for quite some time in every corner of Russia. He spoke passionately to student dissidents about the need to organise. [[Marxist]] writer [[Vera Zasulich]] (whose sister Alexandra sheltered him in Moscow) recalls that when she first met Nechayev, he immediately tried to recruit her:

:Nechayev began to tell me his plans for carrying out a revolution in Russia in the near future. I felt terrible: it was really painful for me to say "That's unlikely," "I don't know about that". I could see that he was very serious, that this was no idle chatter about revolution. He could and would act – wasn't he the ringleader of the students? ... I could imagine no greater pleasure than serving the revolution. I had dared only to dream of it, and yet now he was saying that he wanted to recruit me... And what did I know of "the people"? I knew only the house serfs of Biakolovo and the members of my weaving collective, while he was himself a worker by birth.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Many were impressed by the young proletarian and joined the group. However, the already fanatical Nechayev appeared to be becoming more distrustful of the people around him, even denouncing Bakunin as doctrinaire, "idly running off at the mouth and on paper". One ''Narodnaya Rasprava'' member, I. I. Ivanov, disagreed with Nechayev about the distribution of propaganda, and left the group. On November 21, 1869, Nechayev and several comrades beat, strangled and shot Ivanov, hiding the body in a lake through a hole in the ice.

The body was soon found, and some of his colleagues arrested, but Nechayev eluded capture, and left for [[Saint Petersburg]] in late November where he tried to continue his activities to create a clandestine society. On December 15, 1869, he fled the country, heading back to Geneva.

This incident was fictionalised by writer [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] in his [[anti-nihilistic novel]], ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]'', published three years later, in which the character, Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky, is based on Nechayev.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ahgioXQ9g8C&amp;pg=PA60 p. 60]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downfall==
Bakunin and Ogarev embraced Nechayev on his return to Switzerland in January 1870 — Bakunin wrote "I so jumped for joy that I nearly smashed the ceiling with my old head!" Soon after their reunion, Herzen died (21 January 1870), and a large fund from his personal wealth became available to Nechayev to continue his political activities. Nechayev issued a number of [[proclamation]]s aimed at different strata of the Russian population. Together with Ogarev, he published the  [[Kolokol (newspaper)|''Kolokol'' magazine]] (April–May, 1870, issues 1 to 6). In his article "The Fundamentals of the Future Social System" (Главные основы будущего общественного строя), published in the ''People's Reprisal'' (1870, №2), Nechayev shared his vision of a [[communist]] system which [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] would later call "[[barracks communism]]".

Nechayev's suspicion of his comrades had grown even greater, and he began stealing letters and private papers with which to blackmail Bakunin and his fellow exiles should the need arise. He enlisted the help of Herzen's daughter Natalie. While not clearly breaking with Nechayev, Bakunin rebuked Nechayev upon discovery of his duplicity: "Lies, cunning [and] entanglement [are] a necessary and marvelous means for demoralising and destroying the enemy, though ''certainly not'' a useful means of obtaining and attracting new friends". Bakunin then threatened Nechayev with breaking relations with him and with his (perhaps inexistent) organization.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 "According to your way of thinking, you are nearer to the Jesuits than to us. You are a fanatic. This is your enormous and peculiar strength. But at the same time this is your blindness, and blindness is a great and fatal weakness; blind energy errs and stumbles, and the more powerful it is, the more inevitable and serious are the blunders. You suffer from an enormous lack of the critical sense without which it is impossible to evaluate people and situations, and to reconcile means with ends. (...)

As a consequence of these considerations and in spite of all that has happened between us, I would wish not only to remain allied with you, but to make this union even closer and firmer, on condition that you will change the system entirely and will make mutual trust, sincerity and truth the foundation of our future relations. Otherwise the break between us is inevitable." &lt;ref&gt;
Michael Bakunin, “M. Bakunin to Sergey Nechayev,” in Michael Confino, ''Daughter of a Revolutionary: Natalie Herzen and the Bakunin-Nechayev Circle'' (London: Alcove Press, 1974).
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, he began warning friends about Nechayev's behaviour.

The General Council of the foremost left-wing organisation, the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]] of 1864–1876, officially dissociated themselves from Nechayev, claiming he had abused the name of the organisation. After writing a letter to a publisher on Bakunin's behalf, threatening to kill the publisher if he didn't release Bakunin from a contract, Nechayev became even more isolated from his comrades. First International member [[German Lopatin]] accused him of theoretical unscrupulousness and pernicious behaviour,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} prompting Ogarev and Bakunin to publicly claim to have severed their relations with him in 1870.  However privately Bakunin continued to write to Nechayev proposing that they continue to work together. &lt;ref&gt;Wheen, Francis ''Karl Marx'' pp. 346-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1870, as the [[Second French Empire]] of [[Napoleon III]] collapsed, Nechayev published an issue of the ''Commune'' magazine in [[London]]; later, hiding from the [[tsarist]] [[police]], he went underground in [[Paris]] and then in [[Zurich]]. He also kept in touch with the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Blanquist]]s, such as [[Caspar Turski]] and others. In September 1872 [[Karl Marx]] produced the threatening letter (which Nechayev had written to the publisher) at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]] of the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]] at which Bakunin was also expelled from the organisation.

On August 14, 1872, Nechayev was arrested in [[Zurich]] and handed over to the Russian police. He was found guilty on January 8, 1873, and sentenced to 20 years of ''[[katorga]]'' (hard labor) for killing Ivanov.  Nechayev, while locked up in a [[ravelin]] of the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], managed to win over his guards with the strength of his convictions, and by the late 1870s he was using them to pass on correspondence with revolutionaries on the outside. In December 1880 Nechayev established contact with the Executive Committee of '' [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]]'' ("The People’s Will") and proposed a plan for his own escape. However, he abandoned the plan due to his unwillingness to distract the efforts of the members of ''Narodnaya Volya'' from attempting to assassinate the Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] (which they achieved in March 1881).

[[Vera Zasulich]], who ten years earlier had been among those investigated for Ivanov's murder, heard that in 1877 the head of the St. Petersburg police,  [[Fyodor Trepov (senior)|General Trepov]], had ordered the flogging of Aleksei Bogolyubov, a young political prisoner. Though not a follower of Nechayev, she felt outraged at his mistreatment and at the plight of other political prisoners:  she walked into Trepov's office and shot and wounded him ({{OldStyleDate|5 February|1878|24 January}}). In an indication of the popular political feeling of the time, a jury found her not guilty on the grounds that she had acted out of noble intent.

In 1882 Nechayev died in his cell.

Despite his personal courage and fanatical dedication to the revolutionary cause, Nechayev's methods (later called ''[[Nechayevshchina]]'') were viewed to have caused harm to the Russian revolutionary movement by endangering clandestine organizations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The playwright [[Edvard Radzinsky]] suggests that many revolutionaries have successfully implemented  Nechayev's methods and ideas – including [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref name="Radzinsky"/&gt;{{qn|date=June 2015}}

The party was founded by [[Paavo Väyrynen]], its president and only MP, after he was ousted from his previous party, [[Citizens' Party (Finland)|Citizens' Party]].

==History==
[[Paavo Väyrynen]] had successfully run for the [[Finnish Parliament]] in the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2015]], representing the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]]. Väyrynen, however, chose to forfeit his seat in order to serve in the [[European Parliament]] that he had entered earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Paavo Väyrynen palasi eduskuntaan |last=Lehto |first=Mika |work=Ilta-Sanomat |date=12 June 2018 |access-date=19 November 2018 |url= https://www.is.fi/politiikka/art-2000005716018.html |language=fi  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Väyrynen returned to the Finnish Parliament in June 2018, but defected from the Centre Party to [[Citizens' Party (Finland)|Citizens' Party]] which he had founded. The party was, however, already at that time engulfed in a power struggle that resulted in Väyrynen's ouster. In late June, Väyrynen announced that he had founded the Seven Star Movement as a substitute for Citizens' Party, with which he remained in the parliament for a time. The name is inspired by the populist Italian [[Five Star Movement]]. The Seven Star Movement's goals are [[political independence]], [[Neutral country|non-alignment]], and greater [[immigration control]].&lt;ref name=Centre&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ex-Centre elder Paavo Väyrynen sets up yet another party |work=Yle News |date=27 July 2018 |access-date=19 November 2018 |url= https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/ex-centre_elder_paavo_vayrynen_sets_up_yet_another_party/10326386 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A trial court ruled in November 2018 that Väyrynen's ouster had been illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Kansalaispuolue aikoo valittaa hoviin ratkaisusta, jonka mukaan Väyrysen erottaminen oli laiton – 'Mahdoton hyväksyä' |last=de Fresnes |first=Tulikukka |work=Yle News |date=6 November 2018 |access-date=19 November 2018 |url= https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-10494408 |language=fi  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ruling, the legal woes promoted Väyrynen to go forward with his Seven Star Movement rather than Citizens' Party. Later that month, Väyrynen announced that he had officially aligned himself with the {{ill|Seven Star Movement's parliamentary group|fi|Tähtiliikkeen eduskuntaryhmä}}, whose only MP he became.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt; Väyrynen is the president of the party.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8834">In [[labour economics]], '''Shapiro–Stiglitz theory''' of [[efficiency wage]]s (or '''Shapiro–Stiglitz efficiency wage model''')&lt;ref name=Sjostrom1993EW&gt;W. Sjostrom, Job Security in an Efficiency Wage Model, Journal of Macroeconomics, Winter 1993, Vol. 15, No. 1, pp. 183–187&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[economic theory]] of wages and [[unemployment]] in labour [[market equilibrium]]. It provides a technical description of why wages are unlikely to fall and how involuntary unemployment appears. This theory was first developed by [[Carl Shapiro]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]].&lt;ref name=shapiro1984EW&gt;C. Shapiro and J.E. Stiglitz, The American Economic Review, vol 74, 3, pp 433–444 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yellen1984EW&gt;J.L. Yellen, The American Economic Review, vol 74, 2, pp 200–205 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
When full employment is achieved, if a worker is sacked, she automatically finds her next job soon. In the circumstances, she does not need to exert her effort in her job, and thus full employment necessarily motivates a worker to shirk provided that she is happy with loafing on the job.&lt;ref name=yellen1984EW /&gt; Since shirking makes a firm's productivity decline, the firm needs to offer its workers higher wages to eliminate shirking. Then all firms try to eliminate shirking, which pushes up average wages and decreases employment. Hence nominal wages tend to display downward rigidity. In equilibrium, all firms pay the same wage above market clearing, and unemployment makes job loss costly, and so unemployment serves as a worker-discipline device.&lt;ref name=yellen1984EW /&gt; A jobless person cannot convince an employer that she works at a wage lower than the equilibrium wage, because the owner worries that shirking occurs after she is hired. As a result, her unemployment becomes involuntary.

==No-shirking condition==
Suppose utility is a function of wages w and effort e like &lt;math&gt; u(w,e)=w-e &lt;/math&gt;, and workers maximise the utility function with a discount rate r. 
Then let b be the probability per unit time that a worker is dismissed from his job, and now we introduce the expected lifetime utility &lt;math&gt; V_{u} &lt;/math&gt; of an unemployed individual. Then we find the asset value of employment during a short interval [0, T] 
:&lt;math&gt; V_{e} = wT + e^{ -rT } [ bTV_{u} + (1-bT) V_{e}      ]   \; , &lt;/math&gt;
because the worker is either dismissed or kept employed during the time. The exponential function appears, because the occasion of dismiss in the interval is once and [[Poisson distribution]] is used for the discount rate. Due to the short interval, we approximate the exponential function by 1-rT   
:&lt;math&gt; V_{e} = wT + (1-rT) [ bTV_{u} + (1-bT) V_{e}      ]   \; , &lt;/math&gt;
and simple calculation yields
:&lt;math&gt; V_{e} = \frac{wT+bTV_{u} - rbT^{2} V_{u } }{rT+bT-rbT^{2}}   \;  ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{t \rightarrow 0} V_{e} = \frac{w + b V_{u } }{r+b}  \; .  &lt;/math&gt;
Then we find the fundamental asset equation of a worker:
:&lt;math&gt; rV_{e} = w + b( V_{u} - V_{e } )   \; . &lt;/math&gt; 
For a nonshirker the equation is
:&lt;math&gt; r V_{e,N} = w - e + b(V_{u} - V_{e,N} ) \; , &lt;/math&gt; 
and for a shirker 
:&lt;math&gt; r V_{e,S } = w + (b+q) ( V_{u} - V_{e,S} )  \; , &lt;/math&gt;
where q is the probability per unit time that a worker is caught shirking and sacked.&lt;ref name=shapiro1984EW /&gt; Then we see 
:&lt;math&gt; V_{e,N} = \frac{w-e+bV_{u } }{ r+b}   \; , &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; V_{e,S} = \frac{w+ (b+q) V_{u } }{r+b+q}  \; . &lt;/math&gt;   
The condition &lt;math&gt; V_{e,S} &lt; V_{e,N} &lt;/math&gt; is called the no-shirking condition (NSC), which is expressed as 
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{w} = r V_{u} + \frac{ e (r+b+q ) }{q} &lt; w  \;  , &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \hat{w} &lt;/math&gt; is the critical wage.&lt;ref name=shapiro1984EW /&gt; The worker works hard if and only if the NSC is satisfied. Thus if workers get sufficiently high wages, then the NSC is met and they will not shirk. The condition tells us that
* As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the workers exert more effort. 
* As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the expected lifetime utility of an unemployed individual increases.
* As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the probability of being detected shirking decreases.
* As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the discount rate increases. 
* As the critical wage increases, cet.par., the exogenous separation rate increases.

==Market equilibrium==
Let &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; be the probability of getting a job per unit time. In equilibrium, the flow into the unemployment pool must be equal to the flow out. Thus the probability is  
:&lt;math&gt; a = \frac{bL}{N-L}  \;  , &lt;/math&gt;   
where &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; is the aggregate employment and &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; is the total labour supply. In reality, an employee is offered his minimum wage &lt;math&gt; \overline{w} &lt;/math&gt; or its equivalent by law. Thus the NSC becomes 
:&lt;math&gt; \overline{w} + e + \frac{e(a+b+r)}{q} = \hat{w}  &lt; w  \; , &lt;/math&gt; 
and we call it the aggregate NSC.&lt;ref name=shapiro1984EW /&gt; These two yields 
:&lt;math&gt; e + \overline{w} + \frac{e}{q} (  \frac{b}{u} + r ) &lt; w    \; , &lt;/math&gt;   
where the unemployment rate is &lt;math&gt; u = \frac{N-L}{N} &lt;/math&gt;. This constraint suggests that full employment always should involve shirking.

The aggregate production function &lt;math&gt; F(L) &lt;/math&gt; is a function of total effective labour force. 

A firm's labour demand is given by equating the cost of hiring an additional employee to the marginal product of labour. This cost consists of wages and future unemployment benefits. Now consider the case where &lt;math&gt; \overline{w} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; , then we have   
:&lt;math&gt;  \hat{w} =  \frac{d F(L) }{d L}  \quad .  &lt;/math&gt;
In equilibrium, &lt;math&gt; F'(L)= \hat{w} = w^{* } &lt;/math&gt; holds, where &lt;math&gt; w^{* } &lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium wage.   
Then the equilibrium condition becomes   
:&lt;math&gt; F'(L) =  \hat{w} =  e + \frac{e}{q} ( \frac{b}{u} + r  ) = e \left(  1 +  \frac{r + b + a }{q}   \right)  \;    \; .  &lt;/math&gt;
This suggests following things.  
* Demand-side approach: If the employer pays less than &lt;math&gt; w^{* } &lt;/math&gt;, worker's shirking becomes likely to occur (which decreases their productivity). Consequently the wage is unlikely to decrease, and this is a microscopic mechanism of [[nominal rigidity]]. Thus, wage cannot decrease so that it can stabilize employment level, and so unemployement must increase during recession.         
* Supply-side approach: Jobless persons want to work at &lt;math&gt; w^{* } &lt;/math&gt; or lower, but cannot make a credible promise not to shirk at such wages. As a result [[involuntary unemployment]] occurs.&lt;ref name=shapiro1984EW /&gt;

==Job security rules==
The level of employment is changed by rules about job security. Let us consider a firm which consists of an employer and homogeneous employees. Then, suppose the profit of the firm is a function of the level of employment N, the lowest wage &lt;math&gt; W = \frac{L}{p}  &lt;/math&gt; and the level of monitoring M chosen by the employer. 
:&lt;math&gt; \pi = g(N) - \frac{NL}{p} - NM   , &lt;/math&gt;    
where g(N) is the production function, L is the value of on-the-job leisure from shirking, and p is the probability that an employee is caught shirking and sacked.&lt;ref name=Sjostrom1993EW /&gt; Assume that the production function has the upper limit and its second derivative with respect to N is negative. Not to mention, the first derivative is positive. That is a reasonable assumption that the function has its upper bound in term of productivity. Consider, for instance, such a function of time as 
:&lt;math&gt; f(t) = 1 - e^{-t}  . &lt;/math&gt;     
Obviously its first derivative is positive, and second derivative is negative.

Let R be a measure of the difficulty of dismissing an employee who is caught shirking. Then p is a function of both R and M. The first and second derivatives of the profit with regard to N are:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \pi}{\partial N} = \frac{\partial g}{\partial N} - \frac{L}{p}    . &lt;/math&gt;     
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^{2} \pi}{\partial N^{2} } = \frac{\partial^{2} g(N) }{ \partial N^{2 }}   . &lt;/math&gt;
The condition for the maximum of the profit is &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \pi}{\partial N} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, and so we have 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial g(N) }{\partial N} = \frac{L}{p} + M   . &lt;/math&gt; 
Thus differentiating its both sides with regard to R gives us 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^{2} g(N) }{\partial N^{2} }  \frac{ \partial N}{\partial R} = - \frac{L }{p}  \frac{\partial p}{\partial R}  .  &lt;/math&gt; 
It turns out that &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial N}{\partial R}  &lt;/math&gt; is negative, which means that the more difficult to sack a shirker the lower employment level.&lt;ref name=Sjostrom1993EW /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4478">The '''Ten Nation Committee on Disarmament''' ('''TNCD''') was designed to address the issue of [[nuclear disarmament]] during the [[Cold War]]. Created through the combination of a [[United Nations]] resolution and an agreement between the Big Four powers, the TNCD began work in March 1960. It remained intact from March - June 1960.

==History==
The 1960 Ten Nation Committee on Disarmament grew out of the 1959 Big Four meeting in [[Berlin]]. At the meeting, the Big Four powers (United States, United Kingdom, France, Soviet Union) decided to resume previously halted disarmament talks and establish a new international negotiating forum.&lt;ref name=blacker&gt;[[Coit D. Blacker|Blacker, Coit D.]], [[Gloria Duffy|Duffy, Gloria]], Stanford Arms Control Group.

The TNCD's work was divided into two short sessions. The first spanned the period from March 15 - April 29, 1960, on the 29th the committee halted work because of the concurrent Paris Summit. The hiatus lasted until June 7, 1960 when the TNCD reconvened, once again in Geneva. The TNCD's second session was also short. On June 28, 1960 the committee adjourned indefinitely in the aftermath of the failure at the Paris Summit and the [[1960 U-2 incident|U-2 spy plane incident]].&lt;ref name=legault/&gt;&lt;ref name=singh&gt;[[Nagendra Singh|Singh, Nagendra]] and [[Ted McWhinney|McWhinney, Edward]].

{{Politics of Kosovo}}
The '''Turkish Democratic Party of Kosovo''' ({{lang-tr|{{italics correction|Kosova Demokratik Türk Partisi}}}}) is a conservative political party in [[Kosovo]] that represents the [[Turks in Kosovo|Turkish minority]]. It is led by [[Mahir Yağcılar]], the Minister of Environment and Spatial Planning in [[Hashim Thaçi]] government.

It was founded as Turkish Democratic Union (''Türk Demokratik Birliği'') on 19 July 1990 in Prizren and changed its name to the Turkish Democratic Party of Kosovo on 20 June 2001 under [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]]. The party's seat is in [[Prizren]] and has [[Mamuša]] as a stronghold.

At the [[Kosovan parliamentary election, 2004|2004 legislative elections]], the Turkish Democratic Party of Kosovo won 1.2% of the popular vote and 3 out of 120 seats. At the [[Kosovan parliamentary election, 2007|2007 elections]], the party kept its 3 seats in the [[Assembly of Kosovo]], one being from the main list of candidates (Mahir Yağcılar) and two being seats reserved for the Turkish minority (Enis Kervan, Müfera Şinik).

The '''Vigil of the Princes''' refers to two occasions when male members of the [[British Royal Family]] "stood guard" during the [[lying in state]] of one of their relatives during or as part of a [[State funerals in the United Kingdom|British state funeral]] or ceremonial funeral.

==King George V==
King [[Edward VIII]]; [[George VI|Prince Albert, Duke of York (Future King George VI)]]; [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]]; and [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]], took guard on 27 January 1936 at the lying-in-state of their father, [[George V]]. (A fifth son, [[Prince John of the United Kingdom|Prince John]], predeceased his father in 1919). The vigil took place after [[Westminster Hall]] was closed to the public for the evening.

No known photographic record of this event exists, though a painting was made of it after the King's funeral. The [[oil painting]] was produced by [[Frank Beresford]] as the official painting of the King's lying-in-state, and was exhibited for the first time at the [[Royal Academy]] exhibition of 1936 at [[Burlington House]]. The painting, named ''The Princes' Vigil: 12.15am, January 28, 1936'', was subsequently purchased by [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] to give to her son [[Edward VIII]] on his birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bygonederbyshire.co.uk/stories/8203-Frank-Beresford-Derby-artist-painted-royalty/article-1737681-detail/article.html Frank Beresford: Derby artist painted royalty] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719101210/http://www.bygonederbyshire.co.uk/stories/8203-Frank-Beresford-Derby-artist-painted-royalty/article-1737681-detail/article.html |date=2011-07-19 }} - bygonederbyshire.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting, the King is depicted wearing the uniform of the [[Grenadier Guards]], of whom he was the [[Colonel-in-Chief]], the Duke of Gloucester wears the full dress uniform of the [[10th Royal Hussars]] (the regiment in which he served), while the Duke of Kent is in Ceremonial Day Dress uniform of the [[Royal Navy]]. The Duke of York is unseen fully in the painting, although at the end of the catafalque opposite the King is a figure in full [[Foot Guards]] uniform; at this point in time, the Duke of York served as Colonel of the Regiment of the [[Scots Guards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vintage-royalty.tumblr.com/post/59557343633 "The Princes' Vigil: 12.15am, January 28, 1936"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother==
[[Charles, Prince of Wales]]; [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]]; [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]]; and [[David Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon|David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley]], took guard at 16:40 UTC on 8 April 2002 at the lying-in-state of their grandmother, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] (widow of King George VI; daughter-in-law of King George V).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/apr/09/queenmother.monarchy2|title=Grandsons hold vigil as public files past|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=9 April 2002|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four relieved the guard of the [[Royal Company of Archers]], and were themselves relieved by the [[Yeomen of the Guard]] after their twenty-minute vigil. Both the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York wore naval uniform, while the Earl of Wessex and Lord Linley wore black [[morning dress]]; the Earl of Wessex served in the [[Royal Marines]], but chose to leave before completing basic training, while Lord Linley has never served in the forces. Present during the Changing of the Guard were the Prince of Wales' two sons, [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] and [[Prince Harry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1918402.stm|title=Charles returns for second tribute|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=9 April 2002|accessdate=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the future==
[[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] have four children, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]; [[Anne, Princess Royal]]; [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]]; and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]]. They have four grandsons and four granddaughters. The official plans for the Queen's funeral, [[Operation London Bridge]], call for the Queen's children to stand vigil over their mother's coffin, as well for the grandsons and granddaughters to do the same. Should the Duke of Edinburgh lie in state, he may receive the same homage, however he has indicated he does not want the "fuss" of a full state funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Knight|first= Sam|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/16/what-happens-when-queen-elizabeth-dies-london-bridge|title= 'London Bridge is down': the secret plan for the days after the Queen's death|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 March 2017|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Summit on Food Security''' took place in Rome, Italy between 16 and 18 November 2009. The decision to convene the summit was taken by the Council of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) in June 2009, at the proposal of FAO Director-General Dr [[Jacques Diouf]]. Sixty Heads of State and Government and 192 ministers, from 182 countries and the European Community, attended the summit, which took place at FAO's headquarters.

==Context==
The FAO says the global [[food security]] situation has worsened and continues to represent a serious threat. There are 1&amp;nbsp;billion chronically hungry people in the world and recent reports say this number could grow by 100 million in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''1.02 Billion People Hungry: One Sixth Of Humanity Undernourished, More Than Ever Before'', Science Daily, 20 June 2009 [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090619121443.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Food prices remain stubbornly high in developing countries, while the global economic crisis is aggravating the situation by affecting jobs and deepening poverty.

==Achievements==
The Summit adopted unanimously a declaration committing all the nations of the world to eradicate hunger at the earliest possible date. It pledged to substantially increase aid to agriculture in developing countries, so that the world's 1&amp;nbsp;billion hungry can become more self-sufficient. The declaration confirmed the current target for reducing hunger by half by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jeEimi-fD79vUG9uVWzcG7e-A9oAD9C0IJSO0 "UN summit approves new approach to hunger fight, AP, 16 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6918616.ece World leaders at UN summit vow to aid farmers in bid to help starving, Times on line, 16 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Countries agreed to work to reverse the decline in domestic and international funding for agriculture and promote new investment in the sector, to improve governance of global food issues in partnership with relevant stakeholders from the public and private sector, and to face the challenges of [[climate change]] to food security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/37421/icode/ Renewed commitment to end hunger, FAO Media Centre, 16 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
FAO announced in July that Saudi Arabia had agreed to meet the costs of the Summit, estimated at $2.5 million. The offer was made during an official visit to the country by Diouf.&lt;ref&gt;''Saudi Arabia to fund FAO World Food Security Summit'', Asian Peasant Coalition, 30 July 2009 [http://www.asianpeasant.org/content/saudi-arabia-fund-fao-world-food-security-summit]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linked events==

The outcomes of three related events taking place just ahead of the Summit contributed to the debate—a private-sector forum (Milan, 12–13 November), an inter-parliamentary meeting (Rome, 13 November) and a civil society forum (Rome, 14–16 November).

FAO says three events in October 2009 prepared the ground for the Summit. These were: a High-level Expert Forum on How to Feed to World in 2050, from 12–13 October; the Committee on World Food Security, from 14 to 17 October; and [[World Food Day]] on 16 October.

The launch of the [[1 billion hungry campaign]] a week prior to the event. 

FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf told a pre-Summit Private Sector Forum on 12 November that the importance of the private sector has increased due to privatization, globalization and the transformation of the food chain.&lt;ref&gt;Business leaders urged to help find hunger solutions, FAO Media Centre, 12 November 2009 http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/37194/icode/&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of the summit, FAO Director-General began a 24-hour hunger strike to call for action to end the scourge of hunger and in solidarity with the one billion humans who suffer chronic malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;U.N.: One billion worldwide face starvation, CNN, 15 November 2009 http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/11/15/un.hunger/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; He called on "people of goodwill everywhere" to join him in a worldwide hunger strike this weekend.&lt;ref&gt;UN food organisation chief holds hunger strike, 15 November 2009, http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20091115/twl-fao-food-summit-4bdc673.html&lt;/ref&gt;

FAO on Monday 16 November 2009, said that agreeing a [[climate change]] deal in Copenhagen at the [[COP15]] ( 7–18 December 2009) is crucial to fighting global hunger, which Brazil's president described as "the most devastating weapon of mass destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Climate deal key to fight "devastating" hunger: U.N., 16 November 2009, https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSTRE5AF20W20091116&lt;/ref&gt;
