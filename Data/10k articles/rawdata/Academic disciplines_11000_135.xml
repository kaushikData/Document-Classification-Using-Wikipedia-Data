'''ASTRON''' is the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy. Its main office is in [[Dwingeloo]] in the [[Dwingelderveld National Park]] in the province of Drenthe. ASTRON is part of  [[Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek|Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] (NWO).

==Goals==
ASTRON's main mission is to make discoveries in radio astronomy happen, via the development of new and innovative technologies, the operation of world-class radio astronomy facilities, and the pursuit of fundamental astronomical research. Engineers and astronomers at ASTRON have an outstanding international reputation for novel technology development, and fundamental research in galactic and extra-galactic astronomy. 

ASTRON's programme has three principal elements:
*The operation of front line observing facilities, including especially the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]] and [[LOFAR]],
* The pursuit of fundamental astronomical research using ASTRON facilities, together with a broad range of other telescopes around the world and space-borne instruments (e.g. Sptizer, HST etc.)
*A strong technology development programme, encompassing both innovative instrumentation for existing telescopes and the new technologies needed for future facilities.

In addition, ASTRON is active in the international science policy arena and is one of the leaders in the international SKA project. The [[Square Kilometre Array]] will be the world’s largest and most sensitive radio telescope with a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometre. The SKA will be built in Southern Africa and in Australia. It is a global enterprise bringing together 11 countries from the 5 continents.

==Observing facilities==
===Radio telescopes===
[[File:Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope WSRT (1357-59).jpg|thumb|[[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]] in 2010]]
ASTRON operates the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]] (WSRT), one of the largest radio telescopes in the world. The WSRT and [[LOFAR|the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT)]] are dedicated to explore the universe at radio frequencies from 8 GHz down to 10 MHz.

In addition to its use as a stand-alone radio telescope, the Westerbork array participates in the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (EVN) of radio telescopes.

ASTRON is the host institute for the [[Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe]] (JIVE). Its primary task is to operate the EVN MkIV VLBI Data Processor (correlator). JIVE also provides a high-level of support to astronomers and the Telescope Network. ASTRON also hosts the NOVA Optical/ Infrared instrumentation group.

==Technology development==
[[File:SKA site, South Africa 2014 45.jpg|thumb|right|Mid-frequency aperture array test site for the SKA, in South Africa]]
Discovery in astronomy goes hand in hand with innovation in technology. ASTRON pursues an proactive programme of technical development, aimed both at providing innovative instrumentation for use on current observing facilities, and at laying the groundwork for future generations of telescopes and signal processing instrumentation.

To these ends, the ASTRON facility in Dwingeloo maintains a well equipped R&amp;D division specializing in the design, prototyping and qualification of:
* Low noise, ambient and cryogenic radio receiver systems (0.2 - 345 GHz)
* Very high speed digital electronics
* Antennas, especially in the array environment
* Advanced instrumentation for use at optical and infrared wavelengths
* Algorithm and software engineering for instrument control and for imaging

In [[broadcast engineering]] for radio or television, the '''airchain''' or '''transmission chain''' (UK) (sometimes '''air chain''' (US) or just '''chain''' (UK)) is the path or route an [[Sound reproduction|audio]] or [[video]] [[signal (information theory)|signal]] takes on its way through a [[radio station]] or [[television station]].

The airchain begins with [[camera]]s, [[microphone]]s, [[CD player]]s, [[phonograph|turntable]]s, [[telephone hybrid]]s, [[video tape recorder]]s, [[satellite]] and other [[remote broadcast|remote]] feeds, and other input devices in the [[studio]] and [[control room]].  These feed into a [[mixing console]], possibly via a router.  The output then goes to an [[audio processor]], and finally to the [[transmitter]], [[feedline]], and [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]].  Often, there is a [[studio-transmitter link]] via [[radio]] or [[broadband]] [[dedicated circuit]] (usually [[T-carrier|T1]] or [[T-carrier|E1]] line).  

The airchain may be all-[[analog (signal)|analog]]ue, all-[[Digital data|digital]], or most likely some hybrid of the two.

All-analog airchains typically use cables terminated in [[XLR connector|XLR]] connectors between each device. All-digital airchains also often use XLR connectors, except carrying [[AES/EBU]] digital audio instead. Alternatively, some digital airchains have significant portions of audio carried over [[TCP/IP]], in which case [[Ethernet]] is used.

{{Infobox Observatory}}
'''Armagh Observatory''' is an astronomical research institute in [[Armagh]], [[Northern Ireland]]. Around 25 astronomers are based at the observatory, studying stellar astrophysics, the [[Sun]], [[Solar System]] astronomy and  Earth's [[climate]].

==History==
The Observatory is located close to the centre of the city of Armagh, adjacent to the [[Armagh Planetarium]] in approximately {{convert|14|acre|m2}} of landscaped grounds known as the Armagh Astropark. It was founded in 1789 by [[The Most Reverend|The Most Rev.]] and [[Right Honourable|Rt Hon.]] [[Richard Robinson, 1st Baron Rokeby|The 1st Baron Rokeby]], [[Church of Ireland]] [[Primate of All Ireland|Lord Primate of All Ireland]] and [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Lord Archbishop of Armagh]].

[[Ernst Julius Öpik]] (grandfather of [[Lembit Öpik]] MP) was based here for over 30 years and among his many contributions to astrophysics he wrote of the dangers of an asteroid impacting on the Earth.

==Facilities==
There are scale models of the Solar System and the Universe, two sundials and historic telescopes, as well as telescope domes and other outdoor exhibits. The Human Orrery, launched in 2004, is located close to the main Observatory building. The Observatory's specialist library and archives, and collections of scientific instruments and artefacts associated with the development of modern astronomy, represent one of the leading collections of its kind in the [[British Isles]].

'''Behavioral enrichment''' (also referred to as '''environmental enrichment''') is an [[animal husbandry]] principle that seeks to enhance the quality of captive animal care by identifying and providing the environmental stimuli necessary for optimal psychological and physiological [[Quality of life|well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;Shepherdson, D.J. (1998) “Tracing the path of environmental enrichment in zoos” in Shepherdson, D.J., Mellen, J.D. and Hutchins, M. (1998) Second Nature – Environmental Enrichment for Captive Animals, 1st Edition, Smithsonian Institution Press, London, UK, pp. 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental enrichment can either be active or passive, depending on whether it requires direct contact between the animal and the enrichment. A variety of enrichment techniques are used to create desired outcomes similar to an animals individual and species' history. Each of the techniques used are intended to stimulate the animal's senses similarly to how they would be activated in the wild. Provided enrichment may be seen in the form of auditory, olfactory, habitat factors, food, research projects, training, and objects.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nationalzoo.si.edu/SCBI/AnimalEnrichment/|title=Animal Enrichment - National Zoo|website=nationalzoo.si.edu|access-date=2016-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401200044/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/SCBI/AnimalEnrichment/|archive-date=2016-04-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
Environmental enrichment improves the overall welfare of animals in captivity and creates a habitat similar to what they would experience in their wild environment. It can aims to maintain an animal's physical and psychological health by increasing the range or number of species-specific behaviors, increasing positive interaction with the captive environment, preventing or reducing the frequency of [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal behaviors]], such as [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypies]], and increasing the individual's ability to cope with the challenges of captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stlzoo.org/animals/enrichmenttraining/animalenrichment/|title=Animal Enrichment :: Saint Louis Zoo|website=www.stlzoo.org |access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental enrichment can be offered to any animal in captivity, including:

Environmental enrichment can be beneficial to a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates such as land [[mammal]]s, [[marine mammal]]s, and [[amphibian]]s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ammpa.org/faqs.html#5|title=Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums|website=www.ammpa.org|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, specific regulations ([[Animal Welfare Act of 1966]]) must be followed for enrichment plans in order to guarantee, regulate, and provide appropriate living environments and stimulation for animals in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kulpa-Eddy JA, Taylor S, Adams KM | title = USDA perspective on environmental enrichment for animals | journal = ILAR Journal | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–94 | date = 2005-01-01 | pmid = 15775018 | doi = 10.1093/ilar.46.2.83 | url = http://ilarjournal.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/2/83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (also known as the AZA), requires that [[animal husbandry]] and welfare be a main concern for those caring for animals in captivity.

== Passive enrichment ==
Passive enrichment provides sensory stimulation but no direct contact or control. This type of enrichment is commonly used for its potential to benefit several animals simultaneously as well as requiring limited direct animal contact.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meade TM, Hutchinson E, Krall C, Watson J | title = Use of an aquarium as a novel enrichment item for singly housed rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) | journal = Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science | volume = 53 | issue = 5 | pages = 472–7 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25255069 | pmc = 4181688 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual enrichment ===
Visual enrichment is typically provided by changing the layout of an animal's holding area. The type of visual enrichment can vary, from something as simple as adding pictures on walls to videotapes and television. Visual enrichment such as television can especially benefit animals housed in single cages.&lt;ref name="Lutz_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lutz CK, Novak MA | title = Environmental enrichment for nonhuman primates: theory and application | journal = ILAR Journal | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 178–91 | date = 2005 | pmid = 15775027 | doi = 10.1093/ilar.46.2.178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirrors are also a potential form of enrichment, specifically for animals that display an understanding of self-recognition, such as non-human primates. In addition to using mirrors to reflect the animal's own image, mirrors can also be angled so the animal is able to see normally out-of-sight areas of the holding area.&lt;ref name="Lutz_2005" /&gt;

Enclosures in modern zoos are often designed to facilitate environmental enrichment. For example, the [[Denver Zoo]]'s exhibit Predator Ridge allows different African [[carnivora|carnivores]] to be rotated among several enclosures, providing the animals with a differently sized environment.

=== Auditory enrichment ===
In the wild, animals are exposed to a variety of sounds that they normally do not encounter in captivity. Auditory enrichment can be used to mimic the animal's natural habitat. Types of nature-based auditory enrichment include rainforest sounds and conspecific vocalizations.&lt;ref name="Lutz_2005" /&gt;

The most common form of auditory enrichment is music, whose principal stems primarily from its benefit to humans. The benefits of [[classical music]] have been widely studied in animals, from sows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=Flávia R.

== Active enrichment ==
[[File:Behavioral enrichment - Feeding.JPG|thumb|alt=Behavioral enrichment – Feeding|Active enrichment during feeding session]]Active enrichment often requires the animal to perform some sort of physical activity as well as direct interaction with the enrichment object. Active enrichment items can temporarily reduce stereotypic behaviors as their beneficial effects are usually limited to the short periods of active use.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;[[File:Behavioral enrichment - Sensory.JPG|thumb|alt=Behavioral enrichment – Sensory|Inanimate tactile enrichment with paper bag]]

=== Inanimate tactile enrichment ===
Inanimate tactile enrichment encourages the animal to explore and manipulate various kinds of inanimate objects, behaviors that the animal would naturally display in the wild. Most inanimate tactile enrichment occurs in the context of searching for food, such as cracking open a nut or digging holes in tree trunks for worms. Other common manipulable tactile objects include rubber toys stuffed with treats. Instead of providing the food directly, foraging devices are useful in increasing the amount of searching and foraging of food, comparable to the amount of time they would spend in the wild.&lt;ref name="Lutz_2005" /&gt; Elaborate systems of food presentation have also been developed (e.g. presenting dead [[rat]]s for [[wildcat]]s in a Swedish zoo){{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and computer programmed devices which allow the animals in the enclosure to search for prey as they would in their natural environment.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Inanimate tactile enrichment can also be beneficial without the association with food. For example, stones have been shown to encourage exploratory behavior in [[Japanese macaque]]s. Interaction with the stones exhibited behaviors such as gathering, rolling in hands, rubbing, and carrying.&lt;ref name="Lutz_2005" /&gt;

Other common forms include cardboard, forage, and even the texture of the food (i.e. hard, smooth, cold, warm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arkanimals.com/ark/e_enrichment_101.html#TACTILE|title=Enrichment 101: Environment, Enrichment, &amp; Education|website=www.arkanimals.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Olfactory enrichment ===
Olfactory enrichment can stimulate naturalistic behavior, enhance exploration, and reduce inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-73945-8_37|title=Chemical Signals in Vertebrates 11|last=Clark|first=Fay|last2=King|first2=Andrew J. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2008|publisher=Springer, New York, NY|isbn=9780387739441|pages=391–398|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-73945-8_37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of enrichment is most commonly used for wild felines, both large and small. Exposure to different odors has been shown to influence behavior, resulting in increased activity and exploration.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=Deborah L.|last2=Egli|first2=Justin M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=The influence of olfactory enrichment on the behaviour of captive black-footed cats, Felis nigripes|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2003.08.013|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=85|issue=1-2|pages=107–119|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2003.08.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odors can be smeared or sprayed on an object such as a ball or a tree branch. Types of odors can include catnip, odor of conspecific, or perfume.

=== Cognitive enrichment ===
Lack of cognitive stimulation could cause boredom and frustration which are manifested in behavioral disturbances. Because most cognitive enrichment is reinforced with food, it activates reward-related circuits in the brain that can directly affect emotional processes of appraisal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyer S, Puppe B, Langbein J | title = [Cognitive enrichment in zoo and farm animals--implications for animal behaviour and welfare] | journal = Berliner Und Munchener Tierarztliche Wochenschrift | volume = 123 | issue = 11-12 | pages = 446–56 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21141273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Puzzle feeders are a common method of providing cognitive enrichment, as it makes food harder to access than during routine feeding. Some consider training to be a form of cognitive enrichment, since it requires animals to use their cognitive skills to respond to cues.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Fay|title=Cognitive enrichment and welfare: Current approaches and future directions|url=http://www.animalbehaviorandcognition.org/article.php?id=907|journal=Animal Behavior and Cognition|volume=4|issue=1|pages=52–71|doi=10.12966/abc.05.02.2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computerized tasks are growing in popularity as it provides feedback as to whether an animal is cognitively enriched. These tasks are designed to test a specific cognitive skill and are standardized so that performance can be compared within and between subjects. It is important to ensure that the task provided is not too easy for the animal, nor too difficult that they get discouraged.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

=== Social enrichment ===
Social enrichment can either involve housing a group of conspecifics or animals of different species that would naturally encounter each other in the wild. Social animals in particular (i.e. most primates, lions, flamingos, etc.), benefit from social enrichment because it has the positive effect of creating confidence in the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.colchester-zoo.com/explore/environmental-enrichment|title=Environmental Enrichment - Colchester Zoo|last=User|first=Super|access-date=2018-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social enrichment can encourage social behaviors that are seen in the wild, including feeding, foraging, defense, territoriality, reproduction, and courtship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://littlerockzoo.com/socialenrichment|title=Social Enrichment|website=littlerockzoo.com|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human-interaction enrichment ===
The most common form of human-interaction enrichment is training. The human and animal interaction during training builds trust, and increases the animal's cooperation during clinical and research procedures. In addition, training sessions have been shown to benefit the welfare of both individually housed animals and communally housed animals by providing cognitive stimulation, increasing social play, decreasing inactivity, and mitigating social aggression during feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker KC | title = Benefits of Positive Human Interaction for Socially-Housed Chimpanzees | journal = Animal Welfare | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 239–245 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 20505791 | pmc = 2875797 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amount of enrichment==

A survey of over 200 staff working with mammals at 60 zoos in 13 countries found that all forms of enrichment were considered important for mammals, but several of them were rarely available, because of lack of staff or other priorities.&lt;ref name="hoy"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoy JM, Murray PJ, Tribe A | title = Thirty years later: enrichment practices for captive mammals | journal = Zoo Biology | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–16 | date = 2010 | pmid = 19434736 | doi = 10.1002/zoo.20254 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Julia_Hoy/publication/24420182_Thirty_Years_Later_Enrichment_Practices_for_Captive_Mammals/links/54e697870cf277664ff634f0.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessing the success==

A range of methods can be used to assess which environmental enrichments should be provided.  These are based on the premises that captive animals should perform behaviours in a similar way to those in the [[ethogram]] of their ancestral species,&lt;ref name="Dawkins, (1989)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dawkins MS | year = 1989 | title = Time budgets in red junglefowl as a baseline for the assessment of welfare in domestic-fowl. | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 24 | pages = 77–80 | doi = 10.1016/0168-1591(89)90126-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; animals should be allowed to perform the activities or interactions they prefer, i.e. [[Preference test|preference test studies]],&lt;ref name="Sherwin and Glenn, (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sherwin CM, Glen EF | year = 2003 | title = Cage colour preferences and effects of home-cage colour on anxiety in laboratory mice. | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 66 | pages = 1085–1092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and animals should be allowed to perform  those activities for which they are highly motivated, i.e. [[Consumer demand tests (animals)|motivation studies]].&lt;ref name="Sherwin, (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sherwin CM | year = 2004 | title = The motivation of group-housed laboratory mice, Mus musculus, for additional space. | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 67 | pages = 711–717 | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.08.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental enrichment is a way to ensure that an animals natural and instinctual behaviors are kept and able to be passed and taught from one generation to the next. Enrichment techniques that encourage species specific behaviors, like those that are discovered in the wild, have been studied and found to help the process of reintroduction of [[endangered species]] into their natural habitats, as well as helping to create offspring with natural traits and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-0721-1_8|title=The role of environmental enrichment in the captive breeding and reintroduction of endangered species| vauthors = Shepherdson O |date=1994-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401043113| veditors = Olney PJ, Mace GM, Feistner AT |pages=167–177|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-0721-1_8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main way the success of environmental enrichment can be measured is by recognizing the behavioral changes that occur from the techniques used to shape desired behaviors of the animal compared to the behaviors of those found in the wild.&lt;ref name=":4x"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LmKCN-7kluYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=success+of+environmental+enrichment+in+zoos&amp;ots=g2M-isKBgc&amp;sig=J_jekMLB5R_7237kznz3o63IpH0#v=onepage&amp;q=success%252520of%252520environmental%252520enrichment%252520in%252520zoos&amp;f=false|title=The Biology of Animal Stress: Basic Principles and Implications for Animal Welfare|last=Moberg|first=Gary P.|last2=Mench|first2=Joy A. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2000-01-01|publisher=CABI|isbn=9780851999302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ways that the success of environmental enrichment can be assessed quantitatvely by a range of [[Animal welfare science|behavioral and physiological indicators of animal welfare]].  In addition to those listed above, behavioral indicators include the occurrence of [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal behaviours]] (e.g. [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypies]],&lt;ref name="Mason, (1991)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mason GJ | year = 1991 | title = Stereotypies - A critical review. | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 41 | pages = 1015–1037 | doi = 10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80640-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Claes et al., (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Claes A, Attur Shanmugam A, Jensen P | year = 2010 | title = Habituation to environmental enrichment in captive Sloth Bears-effect on stereotypies | journal = Zoo Biology | volume = 29 | pages = 705–714 | doi = 10.1002/zoo.2030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cognitive bias]] studies,&lt;ref name="Mendl et al., (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendl M, Burman OH, Parker RM, Paul ES | year = 2009 | title = Cognitive bias as an indicator of animal emotion and welfare: Emerging evidence and underlying mechanisms. | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 118 | pages = 161–181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effects of [[frustration]].&lt;ref name="Duncan and Wood-Gush, (1971)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duncan IJ, Wood-Gush DG | year = 1971 | title = Frustration and aggression in the domestic fowl. | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 19 | pages = 500–504 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimmerman et al., (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimmerman PH, Lundberg A, Keeling LJ, Koene P | year = 2003 | title = The effect of an audience on the gakel-call and other frustration behaviours in the laying hen (Gallus gallus domesticus) | journal = Animal Welfare | volume = 12 | pages = 315–326 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physiological indicators include [[heart rate]],&lt;ref name="Kemppinen et al., (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kemppinen N, Hau J, Meller A, Mauranen K, Kohila T, Nevalainen T | year = 2010 | title = Impact of aspen furniture and restricted feeding on activity, blood pressure, heart rate and faecal corticosterone and immunoglobulin A excretion in rats (Rattus norvegicus) housed in individually ventilated cages | journal = Laboratory Animals | volume = 44 | pages = 104–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[corticosteroids]],&lt;ref name="Laws et al., (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laws N, Ganswindt A, Heistermann M, Harris M, Harris S, Sherwin C | year = 2007 | title =  A case study: fecal corticosteroid and behavior as indicators of welfare during relocation of an asian elephant. | journal = Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science | volume = 10 | pages = 349–358 | doi = 10.1080/10888700701555600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immune system|immune function]],&lt;ref name="Martin et al., (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin LB, Kidd L, Liebl AL, Coon CA | title = Captivity induces hyper-inflammation in the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 214 | issue = Pt 15 | pages = 2579–85 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21753052 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.057216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroscience|neuorobiology]],&lt;ref name="Lewis et al., (2006)"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lewis MH, Presti MF, Lewis JB, Turner CA | year = 2006 | chapter = The neurobiology of stereotypy I: Environmental complexity.  | title = Stereotypic Animal Behaviour: Fundamentals and Applications to Welfare | veditors = Mason G, Rushen J | journal = CABI | pages =  190–226 | doi = 10.1079/9780851990040.0190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[eggshell]] quality&lt;ref name="Hughes et al., (1986)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes BO, Gilbert AB, Brown MF | year = 1986 | title = Categorisation and causes of abnormal egg shells: relationship with stress. | journal = British Poultry Science | volume = 27 | pages = 325–337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[thermography]].&lt;ref name="Wilcox et al., (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilcox CS, Patterson J, Cheng HW | year = 2009 | title = Use of thermography to screen for subclinical [[Bumblefoot (infection)|bumblefoot]] in poultry.  | journal = Poultry Science | volume = 88 | pages = 1176–1180 | doi = 10.3382/ps.2008-00446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very difficult for zookeepers to measure the effectiveness of enrichment in terms of the stress due to the fact that animals that are found in zoos are oftentimes on display and presented with very abnormal conditions that can cause uneasiness and stress. Measuring enrichment in terms of [[reproduction]] is easier because of our ability to record offspring numbers and fertility. By making necessary environment changes and providing mental stimulation, animals in captivity have been seen to reproduce at a more similar rate to their wild ancestors in comparison to those provided with less behavioral and environmental enrichment.&lt;ref name=":4x" /&gt;

== Issues and concerns ==

=== Habituation ===
Although environmental enrichments can provide sensory and social stimulations, it can also have limited efficacy if not changed frequently. Animals can become habituated to environmental enrichments, showing positive behaviors at onset of exposure and progressively declining with time. Environmental enrichments are effective primarily because it offers novelty stimuli, making the animal's daily routines less predictable, as would be in the wild. Therefore, maintaining novelty is important for the efficacy of the enrichment. Frequently changing the type of environmental enrichment will help prevent habituation.&lt;ref name="Bowman A 2017"/&gt;

=== Training ===
Usage of more highly advanced enrichment devices, such as computerized devices, requires training. This can lead to issues as training often consists of food as a reward. While food encourages the animal to participate with the device, the animal could associate the device with food. As a result, the interaction with the enrichment would bring about behaviors that are associated with training instead of the desired playful and voluntary behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = French F, Mancini C, Sharp H | title = High tech cognitive and acoustic enrichment for captive elephants | journal = Journal of Neuroscience Methods | volume = 300 | pages = 173–183 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 28951175 | doi = 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.09.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Time and resources ===
The process of producing and providing environmental enrichment usually require a large allocation of time and resources. In a survey,&lt;ref name="hoy" /&gt; "time taken by animal care staff to complete other tasks" was the most significant factor influencing environmental enrichment provisions and scheduling. Therefore it is important to develop appropriate environmental enrichment programs that can be effectively carried out with the size of staff and time available.

'''Bette Korber''' is an American [[computational biologist]] focusing on the molecular biology and population genetics of the [[HIV virus]] that causes infection and eventually AIDS. She has contributed heavily to efforts to obtain an effective HIV vaccine.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Bette Korber created a database at Los Alamos National Laboratory that has enabled her to design novel mosaic HIV vaccines, one of which is currently in human testing in Africa.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  The database contains thousands of  HIV genome sequences and related data.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Korber is a Scientist in Theoretical Biology and Biophysics&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{citation|last1=Korber|first1=B.|last2=Kuiken|first2=C.|year=2002|title=The HIV Databases: History, Design, and Function|editor-last=Leitner|editor-first=T.|work=The Molecular Epidemiology of Human Viruses|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Boston, MA}}.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. She has received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, the Department of Energy's highest award for scientific achievement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://science.energy.gov/lawrence/award-laureates/2000s/korber/|title=The Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award|last=|first=|date=|website=US Department of Energy, Office of Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also received several other awards including the Elizabeth Glaser Award for pediatric AIDS research&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and the Richard Feynman Award for Innovation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Bette Korber grew up in Southern California and received the BS in Chemistry in 1981 from [[California State University, Long Beach]], where her father was a sociology professor, her mother graduated in nursing, and her sister graduated in journalism.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.csulb.edu/colleges/cnsm/alumni/|title=2001 Distinguished Alumna Bette Korber|last=|first=|date=|website=California State University at Long Beach|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1981 to 1988, she was in the graduate program at [[California Institute of Technology|California Institute of Technolog]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;y, where she worked with [[Iwona Stroynowski]] in [[Leroy Hood]]'s laboratory&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  receiving her PhD in Chemistry in 1988.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Her work focused on regulation of the expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex Type 1 genes, producing cell surface proteins that participate in the [[Transplant rejection|rejection]] of tissue transplants, by [[Interferon]] induced by virus infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=B.

== Research ==
[[File:HIV Release.jpg|thumb|HIV Release from Infected Cell]]
Bette Korber conducts her research at Los Alamos National Laboratory where she began in 1990.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Her approach involves applying computational biology to the design of a [[vaccine]] against [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] virus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  She first became interested in HIV when a close friend of Korber's and her fiancé's at California Institute of Technology contracted one of the first cases of AIDS in Pasadena, CA.  She said,“We learned a lot about HIV while he was sick. But there was no treatment for him and he died in 1991. I decided when I graduated from my PhD program that I wanted to work on HIV.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{citation|last=McEnerny|first=R.|date=2010|title=Tracking HIV Evolution|work=IAVI Report|volume=14|issue=3|pages=4–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later, looking back on this event, she described its effects this way: “I ''hate'' HIV,” she says, .... “I lost a couple friends to it. HIV kills in horrible ways. I think of what the epidemic has done to Africa and it motivates me.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:HIV-SIV-phylogenetic-tree1.svg|thumb|Phylogenetic Tree Showing HIV compared to SIV]]

=== HIV database ===
Korber oversees the HIV [[Database]] and Analysis Project at Los Alamos.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She and her team have built a global HIV database of over 840,000 sequences from publications of the viral genome.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newswise.com/articles/promising-los-alamos-innovations-take-the-spotlight-|title=Promising Los Alamos Innovations Take the Spotlight: Bette Korber receives 2018 Richard P Feynman Innovation Award for HIV vaccine designs|last=|first=|date=|website=Newswise Los Alamos|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the database focuses on the small regions (called [[epitope]]s) within the virus that can be recognized by [[antibodies]], and evaluates the evidence for the strength of each epitope in eliciting immune responses.  Also, there are data on the immunological profiles of individuals resistant to HIV.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She and many other researchers have applied the data to devise possible treatments and vaccines against HIV.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her work has resulted in design of vaccines now being tested in clinical trials.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== HIV vaccine design ===
Creating a vaccine against HIV has been challenging because the virus [[Mutation|mutates]] rapidly, creating multiple variants that may not be recognized by immune system components specific to the original infecting virus.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/lanl-biologist-cautiously-optimistic-about-hiv-vaccine/article_0e0a6c0d-e98c-5df8-879b-ef11f710de8b.html|title=LANL biologist 'cautiously' optimistic about HIV vaccine|last=Edge|first=S.|date=December 2, 2017|website=Santa Fe New Mexican|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most variable region is the surface of the virus but there is also some variation of the internal proteins involved in virus replication, which may be attacked by the [[Cell-mediated immunity|cellular immunity]] system or [[T cell]] responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korber|first1=B.|last2=Levin|first2=N.|last3=Haynes|first3=B.|date=2009|title=T-cell vaccine strategies for human immunodeficiency virus, the virus with a thousand faces|journal=Journal of Virology|volume=83|issue=17|pages=8306–8314}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent approach that Korber and collaborators have taken is to design mosaic antigens.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Bette Korber developed a novel mosaic HIV vaccine that may slow or prevent HIV infection and is currently in human testing in Africa.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The goal of the mosaic antigen vaccine is to protect the vaccinated person against the great variety of HIV variants encountered.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Since the proteins of HIV vary so much, mosaic test proteins are designed to represent the most common forms of HIV-1 virus that can be recognized by antibodies or cellular immune responses (epitopes).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.ornl.gov/info/news/pulse/no401/feature.shtml|title="New global HIV vaccine design shows promise in monkeys"|last=|first=|date=November 18, 2018|website=DOE (Department of Energy) Pulse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Korber described the process this way, “I create sort of little Frankenstein proteins that look and feel like HIV proteins but they don’t exist in nature.” &lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Sainani|first=K.|date=2009|title=Evolution and HIV: Using computational phylogenetics to close in on a killer|publisher=Symbios, the NIH National Center for Physics-based Simulation of Biological Structures|magazine=Biomedical Computation Review|pages=20–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the major variations are included in each molecule of protein, thus producing a variant protein antigen that probably doesn't exist in the wild virus population but should cross react with variants that do exist.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Korber has taken two different approaches to designing such antigens.  Her group has developed a [[computer algorithm]] to choose epitopes to combine into a mosaic molecule for the mosaic antigens.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep33987|title=Epigraph: A vaccine design tool applied to an HIV therapeutic vaccine and a pan-filovirus vaccine|last1=Theiler|first1=J.|last2=Yoon|first2=H.|last3=Yusim|first3=K.|last4=Picker|first4=L. J.|last5=Fruh|first5=K.|last6=Korber|first6=B.|date=October 5, 2016|website=Nature Scientific Reports|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she described a designed mosaic protein this way, "People didn’t know if it would fold properly, if it would be antigenic, or if it would have the same sites that recognized by killer T cells."  They found that the newly designed antigens did fold properly and acted as a strong antigen and were recognized by the [[cytotoxic T cell]]s (killer cells).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Also, Korber and her collaborators have developed a graphical analysis called Epigraph that can generate promising antigens with a mixture of epitopes.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Korber explains that the approach of designing a protein via computer, combining bits of known proteins that provoke immune responses, had never been tried.  She says, “Even after it worked, it was hard to convince people that this novel thing could be a vaccine because it hadn’t been done before.” &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In collaboration with Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at [[Harvard Medical School]], some of these antigens have been tested in [[monkey]]s as possible vaccines.  With one series of tests, Barouch checked a number of possible ways to deliver the virus genes and chose to use the common cold virus as a vehicle.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The tested mosaic vaccine routinely slowed monkey infection with the closely related virus SIV, and for 66% of monkeys exposed multiple times, no infection resulted.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Next, in collaboration with the [[National Institutes of Health]], [[Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies]] (a division of [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]), and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]],  the researchers tested a mosaic vaccine for safety in human subjects; it passed that test too.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In 2017, the group of collaborators announced a human efficiency test with that safe mosaic protein preparation, vaccinating 2,600 women in [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub Saharan Africa]], who will be examined for several years to show how efficiently, if at all, the virus interferes with infection.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Korber cautioned that effectiveness of this strategy in monkeys is not a guarantee that a human vaccine will work.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In recognition of her research, Korber received the 2018 Feynman Award for Innovation, the first woman at Los Alamos National Laboratory to receive one.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lanl.gov/discover/news-stories-archive/2018/March/0322-history-of-women.php|title=A short history of women at Los Alamos|last=|first=|date=March 22, 2018|website=Los Alamos National Laboratory|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recalled that at CalTech when few women were there, she took a class with physicist [[Richard Feynman]] and became friends with him. She said, "'At a time when kindness seemed rare, I really appreciated his generous spirit and encouragement. I think he would have been pleased about this award.'”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Origin of HIV-1 ===
In the [[history of HIV/AIDS]] virus with regard to when and where HIV originated, [[Edward Hooper (journalist)|Edward Hooper]] had postulated in a best-selling book called ''The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS'' in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hooper|first=E.|year=1999|title=The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS|publisher=Little, Brown and Co.|location=Boston, New York, and London|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; that HIV could have jumped from chimpanzees to humans because of an accidental contamination by chimpanzee Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) of the oral polio vaccine (CHAT) used in Africa in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hooper|first=E.|date=2003|title=AIDS and the polio vaccine: Edward Hopper finds new evidence|journal=London Review of Books|volume=25|issue=7|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bette Korber and her colleagues employed the Los Alamos National Laboratory database's [[Genomics|genomic]] data to calculate when the HIV [[Molecular evolution|sequence evolution]] began, using a model of evolution based on the mutation rate of HIV strains and assuming that variable was the same on all branches of the evolutionary tree, and in 2000 they published an estimate of approximately 1930 for the origin of the human immunodeficiency virus.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/10/the-hunt-for-the-origin-of-aids/306490/|title=The hunt for the origin of AIDS|last=Cohen|first=J.|date=October 2000|website=The Atlantic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their research was covered widely as establishing a new date for the origin of the human virus, [[Discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories|discrediting the oral polio virus theory]], and therefore refuting concerns about using oral polio vaccine ([[OPV AIDS hypothesis|OPV)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2000/02/scientists-find-origin-of-aids/|title=Scientists find origin of AIDS|last=|first=|date=February 1, 2000|website=Wired|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/02/us/aids-virus-originated-around-1930-study-says.html|title=AIDS Virus Originated Around 1930, Study Says|last=Altman|first=L.|date=February 2, 2000|website=New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/02/news/mn-60177|title=HIV Crossed to Humans 70 Years Ago, Analysis Says|last=Maugh II|first=T.|date=February 2, 2000|website=Los Angeles Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-02/02/006r-020200-idx.html?noredirect=on|title=Theories on AIDS origin argued|last=Brown|first=D.|date=February 2, 2000|website=Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/288/5472/1757|title=Origins of HIV|last=Hillis|first=D.|date=June 9, 2000|website=Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two concepts of the origin of this virus plus other related theories continued to compete for scientific credibility.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/aids/virus/origins.html|title=Theories of HIV Origins|last=Carmichael|first=M.|date=May 30, 2006|website=WGBH educational foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Worobey and collaborators used a computer modeling approach similar to Korber's but with a relaxed evolutionary model and two older samples, collected earlier than any genomes included in Korber's study, and found an origin date for HIV of approximately 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Worobey|first1=M.|last2=Gemmel|first2=M.|last3=Teuwen|first3=D.|last4=Haselkorn|first4=T.|last5=Kunstman|first5=K.|last6=Bunce|first6=M.|last7=Muyembe|first7=J.|last8=Kabongo|first8=J.|last9=Kalengayi|first9=R.|last10=Van Marck|first10=E.|last11=Gilbert|first11=M.

== Personal life ==
Bette Korber married James Theiler in 1988.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  They have two sons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Out of her concern for the impact of AIDS on those with few financial resources, Korber contributed $50,000 from her EO Lawrence Award to help establish, along with family and friends, an AIDS orphanage in [[South Africa]], working through Nurturing Orphans of AIDS for Humanity (NOAH).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She has joined the Board of NOAH.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.noahorphans.org/meet-our-board|title=Meet Our Board: Dr. Bette Korber, Director|last=|first=|date=|website=Nurturing Orphans of AIDS for Humanity (NOAH) website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also contributed to the distribution of Earth Boxes of maintenance-free portable gardens to orphanages, clinics, and schools in Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Uses==
Because of the seemingly paradoxical nature of the glass (being both extremely durable and extremely fragile), Bologna bottles are often used as [[Theatrical property|props]] in magic tricks, where the bottle can be shattered by rattling a small object inside it.

==History==
Mentioned in the publication of the Royal Society around 1740s, the Bologna bottle is named for where it was first discovered in Bologna, Italy. During this period, a glassblower would create a Bologna bottle by leaving the bottle in the open air instead of immediately placing the bottle back into the furnace to cool ([[Annealing (glass)|annealing]]). This produced a special phenomenon, where the bottle would remain intact even when dropped from a distance onto the brick floor, but would immediately rupture if a small piece of flint were placed inside.&lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=SFEVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1343&amp;dq=bologna+bottle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAhaz5hp7TAhUBxmMKHfUxCf0Q6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bologna%20bottle&amp;f=false The Philosophical Transactions and Collections – Royal society of London: Abridged and Disposed Under General Heads, Volume 10 (1743-1750).  p. 1343] &lt;/ref&gt;

Although the bottle can resist a strong external force, the extremely fragile flaws inside the bottle prevent it from being used in practical applications.

'''Business process automation (BPA)''', also known as '''business automation''' or '''digital transformation''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/06/29/mapping-out-business-process-automation-how-bpm-functions-like-a-gps/#3d91f3a33feb Mapping Out Business Process Automation: How BPM Functions Like A GPS] Published by Forbes, June 29, 2017, retrieved August 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; is the technology-enabled [[automation]] of complex&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/bpa-business-process-automation https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/bpa-business-process-automation] Published by Gartner&lt;/ref&gt; [[business process]]es. It can streamline a business for simplicity, achieve [[digital transformation]], increase [[service quality]], improve service delivery or contain costs. It consists of integrating applications, restructuring labor resources and using [[application software|software applications]] throughout the organization. [[Robotic process automation]] is an emerging field within BPA and uses [[artificial intelligence]].

==Deployment of a BPA==
BPAs can be implemented in a number of business areas including [[marketing]], [[sales]] and [[workflow]]. Toolsets vary in sophistication, but there is an increasing trend towards the use of [[artificial intelligence]] technologies that can understand natural language and unstructured [[data set]]s, interact with human beings, and adapt to new types of problems without human-guided training. BPA providers tend to focus on different industry sectors but their underlying approach tends to be similar in that they will attempt to provide the shortest route to automation by exploiting the [[user interface]] layer rather than going deeply into the application code or databases sitting behind them. They also simplify their own interface to the extent that these tools can be used directly by non-technically qualified staff. The main advantage of these toolsets is therefore their speed of deployment, the drawback is that it brings yet another IT supplier to the organization.

The market is, however, evolving in this area.  In order to automate these processes, connectors are needed to fit these systems/solutions together with a data exchange layer to transfer the information. A [[process driven messaging service]] is an option for optimizing your data exchange layer. By mapping your end-to-end process workflow, you can build an integration between individual platforms using a process driven messaging platform. Process driven messaging service gives you the logic to build your process by using triggers, jobs and workflows. Some companies uses an API where you build workflow/s and then connect various systems or mobile devices. You build the process, creating workflows in the API where the workflow in the API acts as a data exchange layer.

==A business process management implementation==
A [[business process management]] system is quite different from BPA. However, it is possible to build automation on the back of a BPM implementation. The actual tools to achieve this vary, from writing custom application code to using specialist BPA tools. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach are inextricably linked – the BPM implementation provides an architecture for all processes in the business to be mapped, but this in itself delays the automation of individual processes and so benefits may be lost in the meantime.

==Deployment of robotic process automation==
The practice of performing [[robotic process automation]] results in the deployment of attended or unattended software agents to an organization's environment. These software agents, or robots, are deployed to perform pre-defined structured and repetitive sets of business tasks or processes. Artificial intelligence software robots are deployed to handle unstructured data sets and are deployed after performing and deploying robotic process automation. Robotic process automation is the leading gateway for the adoption of artificial intelligence in business environments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1693">'''Carbochemistry''' is the branch of [[chemistry]] that studies the transformation of [[coal]]s ([[bituminous coal]], [[anthracite]], [[lignite]], [[graphite]], and [[charcoal]]) into useful products and raw materials. The processes that are used in carbochemistry include [[degasification]] processes such as [[carbonization]] and [[coking]], [[gasification]] processes, and [[liquefaction]] processes.

== History ==
The beginning of carbochemistry goes back to the 16th century. At that time, large quantities of charcoal were needed for the smelting of [[iron ore]]s. Since the production of charcoal required large amounts of slowly-regenerating wood, the use of coal was studied. The use of pure coal was difficult because of the amount of liquid and solid by-products that were generated. In order to improve the handling the coal was initially treated as wood in kilns to produce [[coke (fuel)|coke]].

Around 1684, John Clayton discovered that [[coal gas]] generated from coal was combustible. He described his discovery in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=czpKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR7 An Experiment concerning the Spirit of Coals, by John Clayton, Philosophical Transactions, 1735, No. 452, S. 59]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter T. Layton: ''The Discoverer of Gas Lighting: Notes on the Life and Work of the Rev. John Clayton, D.D., 1657-1725.'' London, 1926&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cas9''' ('''C'''RISPR '''as'''sociated protein '''9''') is an [[RNA]]-guided [[DNA]] [[endonuclease]] [[enzyme]] associated with the [[CRISPR]] (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) adaptive immunity system in ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', among other bacteria. ''S. pyogenes'' utilizes Cas9 to memorize&lt;ref name="Heler2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heler R, Samai P, Modell JW, Weiner C, Goldberg GW, Bikard D, Marraffini LA | title = Cas9 specifies functional viral targets during CRISPR-Cas adaptation | journal = Nature | volume = 519 | issue = 7542 | pages = 199–202 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25707807 | pmc = 4385744 | doi = 10.1038/nature14245 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v519/n7542/full/nature14245.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later interrogate and cleave foreign DNA,&lt;ref name="P22745249"/&gt; such as invading bacteriophage DNA or plasmid DNA.  Cas9 performs this interrogation by unwinding foreign DNA and checking for sites complementary to the 20 basepair spacer region of the guide RNA.  If the DNA substrate is complementary to the guide RNA, Cas9 cleaves the invading DNA. In this sense, the CRISPR-Cas9 mechanism has a number of parallels with the [[RNA interference]] (RNAi) mechanism in eukaryotes.

Apart from its original function in bacterial immunity, the Cas9 protein has been heavily utilized as a genome engineering tool to induce site-directed double strand breaks in DNA. These breaks can lead to gene inactivation or the introduction of heterologous genes through non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination respectively in many laboratory model organisms. Alongside [[zinc finger nuclease]]s and [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALEN]] proteins, Cas9 is becoming a prominent tool in the field of genome editing.

Cas9 has gained traction in recent years because it can cleave nearly any sequence complementary to the guide RNA.&lt;ref name="P22745249" /&gt; Because the target specificity of Cas9 stems from the guide RNA:DNA complementarity and not modifications to the protein itself (like TALENs and Zinc-fingers), engineering Cas9 to target new DNA is straightforward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mali P, Esvelt KM, Church GM | title = Cas9 as a versatile tool for engineering biology | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 957–63 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24076990 | pmc = 4051438 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Versions of Cas9 that bind but do not cleave cognate DNA can be used to localize transcriptional [[activator (genetics)|activator]] or [[repressors]] to specific DNA sequences in order to control transcriptional activation and repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mali P, Aach J, Stranges PB, Esvelt KM, Moosburner M, Kosuri S, Yang L, Church GM | title = CAS9 transcriptional activators for target specificity screening and paired nickases for cooperative genome engineering | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 9 | pages = 833–8 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23907171 | pmc = 3818127 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2675 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="P23849981"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert LA, Larson MH, Morsut L, Liu Z, Brar GA, Torres SE, Stern-Ginossar N, Brandman O, Whitehead EH, Doudna JA, Lim WA, Weissman JS, Qi LS | title = CRISPR-mediated modular RNA-guided regulation of transcription in eukaryotes | journal = Cell | volume = 154 | issue = 2 | pages = 442–51 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23849981 | pmc = 3770145 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.06.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While native Cas9 requires a guide RNA composed of two disparate RNAs that associate to make the guide – the CRISPR RNA (crRNA), and the trans-activating RNA ([[tracrRNA]]).,&lt;ref name="P22745249"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jinek M, Chylinski K, Fonfara I, Hauer M, Doudna JA, Charpentier E | title = A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity | journal = Science | volume = 337 | issue = 6096 | pages = 816–21 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22745249 | doi = 10.1126/science.1225829 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 targeting has been simplified through the engineering of a chimeric single guide RNA (chiRNA).

== CRISPR-mediated immunity ==

=== Introduction ===
To survive in a variety of challenging, inhospitable habitats that are filled with [[bacteriophage]]s, bacteria and archea have evolved methods to evade and fend off predatory [[virus]]es. This includes the CRISPR system of adaptive immunity. In practice, CRISPR acts as a self-programmable restriction enzyme. CRISPR loci are composed of short, palindromic repeats that occur at regular intervals composed of alternate CRISPR repeats and variable CRISPR spacers between 24-48 nucleotides long. These CRISPR loci are usually accompanied by adjacent CRISPR-associated (cas) genes. In 2005, it was discovered by three separate groups that the spacer regions were homologous to foreign DNA elements, including [[plasmid]]s and viruses. These reports provided the first biological evidence that CRISPRs might function as an immune system.

Cas9 has been used often as a genome-editing tool. Cas9 has been used in recent developments in preventing viruses from manipulating hosts’ DNA. Since the CRISPR-Cas9 was developed from bacterial genome systems, it can be used to target the genetic material in viruses. The use of the enzyme Cas9 can be a solution to many viral infections. Cas9 possesses the ability to target specific viruses by the targeting of specific strands of the viral genetic information. More specifically the Cas9 enzyme targets certain sections of the viral genome that prevents the virus from carrying out its normal function.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=CRISPR-Cas : a laboratory manual|others=Doudna, Jennifer A.,, Mali, Prashant|isbn=9781621821304|location=Cold Spring Harbor, New York|oclc=922914104|last1=Doudna|first1=Jennifer A.|last2=Mali|first2=Prashant|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 has also been used to disrupt the detrimental strand of DNA and RNA that cause diseases and mutated strands of DNA.

When introduced into the HIV-1 genome Cas9 has shown the ability to mutate strands of HIV-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing|doi=10.1036/1097-8542.yb150927}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebina H, Misawa N, Kanemura Y, Koyanagi Y | title = Harnessing the CRISPR/Cas9 system to disrupt latent HIV-1 provirus | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 2510 | date = 2013-08-26 | pmid = 23974631 | pmc = 3752613 | doi = 10.1038/srep02510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 has also been used in the treatment of hepatitis b through targeting of the ends of certain of long terminal repeats in the hepatitis b viral genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li H, Sheng C, Wang S, Yang L, Liang Y, Huang Y, Liu H, Li P, Yang C, Yang X, Jia L, Xie J, Wang L, Hao R, Du X, Xu D, Zhou J, Li M, Sun Y, Tong Y, Li Q, Qiu S, Song H | title = Removal of Integrated Hepatitis B Virus DNA Using CRISPR-Cas9 | journal = Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | volume = 7 | pages = 91 | date = 2017-03-22 | pmid = 28382278 | pmc = 5360708 | doi = 10.3389/fcimb.2017.00091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Cas9 has already been used in human trials in the treatment of cystic fibrosis and oncogenic mutations in human pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bogdanovich|first=Sasha | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-02-10|title=Gene Editing With Crispr/Cas9: A New Therapeutic Hope for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy |journal=MOJ Cell Science &amp; Report|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.15406/mojcsr.2016.03.00050|issn=2374-6912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 has used to repair the mutations causing cataracts in mice.

=== Overview of CRISPR-Cas types and function ===
[[File:The Stages of CRISPR immunity.svg|border|right|Fig. 2: The Stages of CRISPR immunity]]
CRISPR-Cas systems are divided into three major types (type I, type II, and type III) and twelve subtypes, which are based on their genetic content and structural differences. However, the core defining features of all CRISPR-Cas systems are the cas genes and their proteins: cas1 and cas2 are universal across types and subtypes, while cas3, cas9, and cas10 are signature genes for type I, type II, and type III, respectively.

===CRISPR-Cas defense stages===
# '''Adaptation''' – [[Adaptation]] involves recognition and integration of spacers between two adjacent repeats in the CRISPR locus. The “Protospacer” refers to the sequence on the viral genome that corresponds to the spacer. A short stretch of conserved nucleotides exists proximal to the protospacer, which is called the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). The PAM is a recognition motif that is used to acquire the DNA fragment.&lt;ref name="Garneau2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garneau JE, Dupuis MÈ, Villion M, Romero DA, Barrangou R, Boyaval P, Fremaux C, Horvath P, Magadán AH, Moineau S | title = The CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system cleaves bacteriophage and plasmid DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7320 | pages = 67–71 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21048762 | doi = 10.1038/nature09523 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.451.9645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In type II, Cas9 recognizes the PAM during adaptation in order to ensure the acquisition of functional spacers.&lt;ref name="Heler2015" /&gt;
# '''CRISPR Processing''' –  CRISPR expression includes the [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of a primary transcript called a CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA), which is transcribed from the CRISPR locus by RNA polymerase. Specific [[endoribonuclease]]s then cleave the pre-crRNAs into small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs).&lt;ref name="Horvath2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horvath P, Barrangou R | title = CRISPR/Cas, the immune system of bacteria and archaea | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 167–70 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20056882 | doi = 10.1126/science.1179555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Interference / Immunity''' – Interference involves the crRNAs within a multi-protein complex called CASCADE, which can recognize and specifically base-pair with regions of inserting complementary foreign DNA. The crRNA-foreign nucleic acid complex is then cleaved, however if there are mismatches between the spacer and the target DNA, or if there are mutations in the PAM, then cleavage will not be initiated. In the latter scenario, the foreign DNA is not targeted for attack by the cell, thus the replication of the virus proceeds and the host is not immune to viral infection. The interference stage can be mechanistically and temporally distinct from CRISPR acquisition and expression, yet for complete function as a defense system, all three phases must be functional.&lt;ref name="Karginov2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karginov FV, Hannon GJ | title = The CRISPR system: small RNA-guided defense in bacteria and archaea | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–19 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20129051 | pmc = 2819186 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2009.12.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage 1: CRISPR spacer integration. Protospacers and protospacer-associated motifs (shown in red) are acquired at the “leader” end of a CRISPR array in the host DNA. The CRISPR array is composed of spacer sequences (shown in colored boxes) flanked by repeats (black diamonds). This process requires Cas1 and Cas2 (and Cas9 in type II&lt;ref name="Heler2015" /&gt;), which are encoded in the cas locus, which are usually located near the CRISPR array.

Stage 2: CRISPR expression. Pre-crRNA is transcribed starting at the leader region by the host RNA polymerase and then cleaved by Cas proteins into smaller crRNAs containing a single spacer and a partial repeat (shown as hairpin structure with colored spacers).

Stage 3: CRISPR interference. crRNA with a spacer that has strong complementarity to the incoming foreign DNA begins a cleavage event (depicted with scissors), which requires Cas proteins. DNA cleavage interferes with viral replication and provides immunity to the host. The interference stage can be functionally and temporarily distinct from CRISPR acquisition and expression (depicted by white line dividing the cell).

==== Transcription deactivation using dCas9 ====
dCas9, also referred to as endonuclease deficient Cas9 can be utilized to edit gene expression when applied to the transcription binding site of the desired section of a gene. The optimal function of dCas9 is attributed to its mode of action. Gene expression is inhibited when nucleotides are no longer added to the RNA chain and therefore terminating elongation of that chain, and as a result affects the transcription process. This process occurs when dCas9 is mass-produced so it is able to affect the most amount of genes at any given time via a sequence specific guide RNA molecule. Since dCas9 appears to down regulate gene expression, this action is amplified even more when it is used in conjunction with repressive chromatin modifier domains.&lt;ref name="pmid28298224"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jensen ED, Ferreira R, Jakočiūnas T, Arsovska D, Zhang J, Ding L, Smith JD, David F, Nielsen J, Jensen MK, Keasling JD | display-authors = 6 | title = Transcriptional reprogramming in yeast using dCas9 and combinatorial gRNA strategies | journal = Microbial Cell Factories | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 46 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28298224 | pmc = 5353793 | doi = 10.1186/s12934-017-0664-2 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dCas9 protein has other functions outside of the regulation of gene expression. A promoter can be added to the dCas9 protein which allows them to work with each other to become efficient at beginning or stopping transcription at different sequences along a strand of DNA. These two proteins are specific in where they act on a gene. This is prevalent in certain types of prokaryotes when a promoter and dCas9 align themselves together to impede the ability of elongation of polymer of nucleotides coming together to form a transcripted piece of DNA. Without the promoter, the dCas9 protein does not have the same effect by itself or with a gene body.&lt;ref name="pmid29056323"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pinto BS, Saxena T, Oliveira R, Méndez-Gómez HR, Cleary JD, Denes LT, McConnell O, Arboleda J, Xia G, Swanson MS, Wang ET | title = Impeding Transcription of Expanded Microsatellite Repeats by Deactivated Cas9 | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 68 | issue = 3 | pages = 479–490.e5 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29056323 | pmc = 6013302 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2017.09.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When examining the effects of repression of transcription further, H3K27, an amino acid component of a histone, becomes methylated through the interaction of dCas9 and a peptide called FOG1. Essentially, this interaction causes gene repression on the C + N terminal section of the amino acid complex at the specific junction of the gene, and as a result, terminates transcription.&lt;ref name="pmid28973434"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Geen H, Ren C, Nicolet CM, Perez AA, Halmai J, Le VM, Mackay JP, Farnham PJ, Segal DJ | title = dCas9-based epigenome editing suggests acquisition of histone methylation is not sufficient for target gene repression | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 45 | issue = 17 | pages = 9901–9916 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28973434 | pmc = 5622328 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkx578 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

dCas9 also proves to be efficient when it comes to altering certain proteins that can create diseases. When the dCas9 attaches to a form of RNA called guide-RNA, it prevents the proliferation of repeating codons and DNA sequences that might be harmful to an organism's genome. Essentially, when multiple repeat codons are produced, it elicits a response, or recruits an abundance of dCas9 to combat the overproduction of those codons and results in the shut-down of transcription. dCas9 works synergistically with gRNA and directly affects the DNA polymerase II from continuing transcription.

Further explanation of how the dCas9 protein works can be found in their utilization of plant genomes by the regulation of gene production in plants to either increase or decrease certain characteristics. The CRISPR-CAS9 system has the ability to either upregulate or downregulate genes. The dCas9 proteins are a component of the CRISPR-CAS9 system and these proteins can repress certain areas of a plant gene. This happens when dCAS9 binds to repressor domains, and in the case of the plants, deactivation of a regulatory gene such as AtCSTF64, does occur.&lt;ref name="pmid28623586"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lowder LG, Paul JW, Qi Y | title = Multiplexed Transcriptional Activation or Repression in Plants Using CRISPR-dCas9-Based Systems | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 1629 | issue = | pages = 167–184 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28623586 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4939-7125-1_12 | isbn = 978-1-4939-7124-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacteria are another focus of the usage of dCas9 proteins as well. Since eukaryotes have a larger DNA makeup and genome; the much smaller bacteria are easy to manipulate. As a result, eukaryotes use dCas9 to inhibit RNA polymerase from continuing the process of transcription of genetic material.&lt;ref name="pmid28581505"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R, Horvath P | title = A decade of discovery: CRISPR functions and applications | journal = Nature Microbiology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 17092 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28581505 | doi = 10.1038/nmicrobiol.2017.92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genomic editing in eukaryotic cells ===
While genomic editing in eukaryotic cells has been possible using various methods since the 1980's the methods employed had proved to be inefficient and impractical to implement on a larger scale. Genomic editing leads to irreversible changes to the gene. Working like genetic scissors, the Cas9 nuclease opens both strands of the targeted sequence of DNA to introduce the modification by one of two methods. Knock-in mutations, facilitated via Homology Directed Repair, is the traditional pathway of targeted genomic editing approaches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang JH, Adikaram P, Pandey M, Genis A, Simonds WF | title = Optimization of genome editing through CRISPR-Cas9 engineering | journal = Bioengineered | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 166–74 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27340770 | pmc = 4927198 | doi = 10.1080/21655979.2016.1189039 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for the introduction of targeted DNA damage and repair. HDR employs the use of similar DNA sequences to drive the repair of the break via the incorporation of exogenous DNA to function as the repair template.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This method relies on the periodic and isolated occurrence of DNA damage at the target site in order for a repair to commence. Knock-out mutations caused by Cas9/CRISPR results in the repair of the double-strand break by means of NHEJ (Non-Homologous End Joining). NHEJ can often result random deletions or insertions at the repair site disrupting or altering gene functionality. Therefore, genomic engineering by CRISPR/Cas9 gives researches the ability to generated targeted random gene disruption. Because of this, the precision of genomic editing is a great concern. With the discovery of CRISPR and specifically the Cas9 nuclease molecule, efficient and highly selective editing is now a reality. Cas9 allows for a reliable method of creating a targeted break at a specific location as designated by the crRNA and tracrRna guide strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang JH, Pandey M, Kahler JF, Loshakov A, Harris B, Dagur PK, Mo YY, Simonds WF | title = Improving the specificity and efficacy of CRISPR/CAS9 and gRNA through target specific DNA reporter | journal = Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 189 | pages = 1–8 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25193712 | pmc = 4252756 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.08.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 derived from ''S. pyogenes'' has facilitated the targeted genomic modification in eukaryotic cells. The ease by which researches can insert Cas9 and template RNA in order to silence or cause point mutations on specific loci has proved invaluable to the quick and efficient mapping of genomic models and biological processes associated with various genes in a variety of eukaryotes. New engineered variant of the Cas9 nuclease have been developed that significantly reduce off-target manipulation. Called spCas9-HF1 (Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 High Fidelity 1), has a success rate of modification in vivo of 85% and undetectable off-target manipulations as measured by genome wide break capture and targeted sequencing methods used to measure total genomic changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kleinstiver BP, Pattanayak V, Prew MS, Tsai SQ, Nguyen NT, Zheng Z, Joung JK | title = High-fidelity CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases with no detectable genome-wide off-target effects | journal = Nature | volume = 529 | issue = 7587 | pages = 490–5 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26735016 | pmc = 4851738 | doi = 10.1038/nature16526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu PD, Lander ES, Zhang F | title = Development and applications of CRISPR-Cas9 for genome engineering | journal = Cell | volume = 157 | issue = 6 | pages = 1262–78 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24906146 | pmc = 4343198 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cellular modeling ===
Cas9 genomic modification has allowed for the quick and efficient generation of transgenic models within the field of genetics. Cas9 can be easily introduced into the target cells via plasmid transfection along with sgRNA in order to model the spread of diseases and the cell's response and defense to infection.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dow LE | title = Modeling Disease In Vivo With CRISPR/Cas9 | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 10 | pages = 609–621 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26432018 | pmc = 4592741 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2015.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of Cas9 to be introduced in vivo allows for the creation of more accurate models of gene function, mutation effects, all while avoiding the of off-target mutations typically observed with older methods of genetic engineering. The CRISPR and Cas9 revolution in genomic modeling doesn’t only extent to mammals. Traditional genomic models such as ''Drosophila Melanogaster,'' one of the first model species, have seen further refinement in their resolution with the use of Cas9.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cas9 uses cell-specific promoters allowing the a controlled use of the Cas9. Cas9 is an accurate method of treating diseases due to the targeting of the Cas9 enzyme only affecting certain cell types. The cells undergoing the Cas9 therapy can also be removed and reintroduced to provide amplified effects of the therapy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Structural studies of Cas9 ==

=== Overview ===
Cas9 features a bi-lobed architecture with the guide RNA nestled between the alpha-helical lobe (blue; Fig. 2) and the nuclease lobe (cyan, orange and gray). These two lobes are connected through a single bridge helix. There are two nuclease domains located in the multi-domain nuclease lobe, the RuvC (gray) which cleaves the non-target DNA strand, and the HNH nuclease domain (cyan) that cleaves the target strand of DNA. The RuvC domain is encoded by sequentially disparate sites that interact in the tertiary structure to form the RuvC cleavage domain (See Figure 3).
[[File:Cas9 Apo Structure.png|thumb|left|Cas9 Apo Structure|Fig. 3: Crystal structure of Cas9 in the Apo form, as solved by M Jinek ''et al.'' in their 2014 ''Science'' paper. Structural rendition was performed using UCSF Chimera software.]]

A key feature of the target DNA is that it must contain a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) consisting of the three-nucleotide sequence- NGG. This PAM is recognized by the PAM-interacting domain (PI domain, orange) located near the C-terminal end of Cas9. Cas9 undergoes distinct conformational changes between the apo, guide RNA bound, and guide RNA:DNA bound states, which are detailed below.

=== Crystal structures in detail ===
Cas9 recognizes the [[stem-loop]] architecture inherent in the CRISPR locus, which mediates the maturation of crRNA-tracrRNA [[ribonucleoprotein]] complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiedenheft B, Sternberg SH, Doudna JA | title = RNA-guided genetic silencing systems in bacteria and archaea | journal = Nature | volume = 482 | issue = 7385 | pages = 331–8 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22337052 | doi = 10.1038/nature10886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 in complex with CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) further recognizes and degrades the target dsDNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ran FA, Hsu PD, Wright J, Agarwala V, Scott DA, Zhang F | title = Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 2281–2308 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24157548 | pmc = 3969860 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2013.143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the co-crystal structure shown here (Fig. 4), the crRNA-tracrRNA complex is replaced by a [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric]] single-guide RNA (sgRNA, in red) which has been proved to have the same function as the natural RNA complex.&lt;ref name="P22745249"/&gt; The sgRNA base paired with target ssDNA is anchored by Cas9 as a T-shaped architecture. This crystal structure of the DNA-bound Cas9 enzyme reveals distinct conformational changes in the alpha-helical lobe with respect to the nuclease lobe, as well as the location of the HNH domain. The protein consists of a recognition lobe (REC) and a nuclease lobe (NUC). It should be noted that all regions except the HNH form tight interactions with each other and sgRNA-ssDNA complex, while the HNH domain forms few contacts with the rest of the protein. In another conformation of Cas9 complex observed in the crystal, the HNH domain is not visible. These structures suggest the conformational flexibility of HNH domain.

So far, three crystal structures have been studied and published. One representing a conformation of Cas9 in the apo state, and two representing Cas9 in the DNA bound state.

=== The interactions between sgRNA and Cas9 ===
[[File:GRNA-Cas9.png|thumb|306x306px|CRISPR/Cas9]]
In sgRNA-Cas9 complex, based on the crystal structure, REC1, BH and PI domains have important contacts with backbone or bases in both repeat and spacer region.&lt;ref name="P24529477"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P25079318"/&gt; Several Cas9 mutants including REC1 or REC2 domains deletion and residues mutations in BH have been tested. REC1 and BH related mutants show lower or none activity compared with wild type, which indicate these two domains are crucial for the sgRNA recognition at repeat sequence and stabilization of the whole complex. Although the interactions between spacer sequence and Cas9 as well as PI domain and repeat region need further studies, the co-crystal demonstrates clear interface between Cas9 and sgRNA.

=== Target digestion ===
Previous sequence analysis and biochemical studies have suggested Cas9 contain RNase H and HNH endonuclease homologous domains which are responsible for cleavages of two target DNA strands, respectively. These results are finally proved in the structure. Although the low sequence similarity, the sequence similar to RNase H has a RuvC fold (one member of RNase H family) and the HNH region folds as T4 Endo VII (one member of HNH endonuclease family). Previous works on Cas9 have demonstrated that HNH domain is responsible for complementary sequence cleavage of target DNA and RuvC is responsible for the non-complementary sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid26912877"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen H, Bailey S | title = Structural biology.

=== Problems Bacteria Pose to Cas-9 Editing ===
Most Archea and Bacteria stubbornly refuse to allow a cas-9 to edit their genome. This is due to the fact that they are able to attach foreign DNA, that does not affect them, into their genome. Another way that these cells defy cas-9 is by process of “Restriction Modification System”. When a bacteriophage, a virus that infects bacteria and archaea and uses them to replicate itself, enters a bacteria or archea cell it is targeted by the RM system. The RM system then cuts the bacteriophages DNA into separate pieces by restriction enzymes and uses endonucleases to further destroy the strands of DNA. This poses a problem to cas-9 editing because the RM system also targets the foreign genes added by the cas-9 process.&lt;ref name="pmid7479944"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kusano K, Naito T, Handa N, Kobayashi I | title = Restriction-modification systems as genomic parasites in competition for specific sequences | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 92 | issue = 24 | pages = 11095–9 | date = November 1995 | pmid = 7479944 | pmc = 40578 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.92.24.11095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications of Cas9 to transcription tuning ==

=== Interference of transcription by dCas9 ===
Due to the unique ability of Cas9 to bind to essentially any complement sequence in any [[genome]], researchers wanted to use this enzyme to repress [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of various genomic [[locus (genetics)|loci]]. To accomplish this, the two crucial catalytic residues of the RuvC and HNH domain can be mutated to [[alanine]] abolishing all endonuclease activity of Cas9. The resulting protein coined ‘dead’ Cas9 or ‘dCas9’ for short, can still tightly bind to dsDNA. This [[catalytic]]ally inactive Cas9 variant has been used for both mechanistic studies into Cas9 DNA interrogative binding and as a general programmable DNA binding RNA-Protein complex.

The interaction of dCas9 with target dsDNA is so tight that high [[molar concentration|molarity]] [[urea]] protein denaturant can not fully dissociate the dCas9 RNA-protein complex from dsDNA target.&lt;ref name="Sternberg2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sternberg SH, Redding S, Jinek M, Greene EC, Doudna JA | title = DNA interrogation by the CRISPR RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 | journal = Nature | volume = 507 | issue = 7490 | pages = 62–7 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24476820 | pmc = 4106473 | doi = 10.1038/nature13011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; dCas9 has been targeted with engineered single guide RNAs to transcription initiation sites of any loci where dCas9 can compete with RNA polymerase at promoters to halt transcription.&lt;ref name="pmid23761437" /&gt; Also, dCas9 can be targeted to the coding region of loci such that inhibition of RNA Polymerase occurs during the elongation phase of transcription.&lt;ref name="pmid23761437"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bikard D, Jiang W, Samai P, Hochschild A, Zhang F, Marraffini LA | title = Programmable repression and activation of bacterial gene expression using an engineered CRISPR-Cas system | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 41 | issue = 15 | pages = 7429–37 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23761437 | pmc = 3753641 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Eukaryotes, silencing of gene expression can be extented by targeting dCas9 to enhancer sequences, where dCas9 can block assembly of transcription factors leading to silencing of specific gene expression.&lt;ref name="P23849981" /&gt; Moreover, the guide RNAs provided to dCas9 can be designed to include specific mismatches to its complementary cognate sequence that will quantitatively weaken the interaction of dCas9 for its programmed cognate sequence allowing a researcher to tune the extent of gene silencing applied to a gene of interest.&lt;ref name="pmid23761437" /&gt;
This technology is similar in principle to [[RNAi]] such that gene expression is being modulated at the RNA level. However, the dCas9 approach has gained much traction as there exist less off-target effects and in general larger and more reproducible silencing effects through the use of dCas9 compared to RNAi screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heintze J, Luft C, Ketteler R | title = A CRISPR CASe for high-throughput silencing | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 4 | pages = 193 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24109485 | pmc = 3791873 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2013.00193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, because the dCas9 approach to gene silencing can be quantitatively controlled, a researcher can now precisely control the extent to which a gene of interest is repressed allowing more questions about gene regulation and gene [[stoichiometry]] to be answered.

Beyond direct binding of dCas9 to transcriptionally sensitive positions of loci, dCas9 can be fused to a variety of modulatory protein domains to carry out a myriad of functions. Recently, dCas9 has been fused to [[chromatin]] remodeling proteins(HDACs/HATs) to reorganize the chromatin structure around various loci.&lt;ref name="pmid23761437" /&gt; This is an important in targeting various eukaryotic genes of interest as heterochromatin structures hinder Cas9 binding. Furthermore, because Cas9 can react to [[heterochromatin]], it is theorized that this enzyme can be further applied to studying the chromatin structure of various loci.&lt;ref name="pmid23761437" /&gt; Additionally, dCas9 has been employed in genome wide screens of gene repression. By employing large libraries of guide RNAs capable of targeting thousands of genes, genome wide genetic screens using dCas9 have been conducted.&lt;ref name="pmid25307932"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert LA, Horlbeck MA, Adamson B, Villalta JE, Chen Y, Whitehead EH, Guimaraes C, Panning B, Ploegh HL, Bassik MC, Qi LS, Kampmann M, Weissman JS | title = Genome-Scale CRISPR-Mediated Control of Gene Repression and Activation | journal = Cell | volume = 159 | issue = 3 | pages = 647–61 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25307932 | pmc = 4253859 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method for silencing transcription with Cas9 is to directly cleave mRNA products with the catalytically active Cas9 enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Connell MR, Oakes BL, Sternberg SH, East-Seletsky A, Kaplan M, Doudna JA | title = Programmable RNA recognition and cleavage by CRISPR/Cas9 | journal = Nature | volume = 516 | issue = 7530 | pages = 263–6 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25274302 | pmc = 4268322 | doi = 10.1038/nature13769 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is made possible by hybridizing ssDNA with a PAM complement sequence to ssRNA allowing for a dsDNA-RNA PAM site for Cas9 binding. This technology makes available the ability to isolate endogenous RNA transcripts in cells without the need to induce chemical modifications to RNA or RNA tagging methods.

=== Transcription activation by dCas9 fusion proteins ===
In contrast to silencing genes, dCas9 can also be used to activate genes when fused to transcription activating factors.&lt;ref name="pmid23761437" /&gt; These factors include subunits of bacterial RNA Polymerase II and traditional transcription factors in eukaryotes. Recently, genome-wide screens of transcription activation have also been accomplished using dCas9 fusions named ‘CRISPRa’ for activation.&lt;ref name="pmid25307932" /&gt;

=== Possible Solutions to Bacterium Cas-9 Editing ===
Recent studies have shown that with some minor modification to the cas-9 protein it is possible to bypass the “Restriction Modification System”. The process that achieves this is called “Photospacing” which means that the cas-9 system will copy a section of DNA from the host and insert it as a spacer gene into its own genome.&lt;ref&gt;Barrangou R, Fremaux C, Deveau H, Richards M, Boyaval P, Moineau S, Romero DA, Horvath P. 2007 CRISPR provides acquired resistance against viruses in prokaryotes. Science 315, 1709–1712.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though we do not fully understand why “photospacers” work we do understand what they do. When a prokaryote “senses” a part of its own genetic coding inside the foreign entity it is less likely to destroy the cas-9 insertion. This is known as the beginning of cas-9 immunity.&lt;ref name="Fineran_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fineran PC, Charpentier E | title = Memory of viral infections by CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems: acquisition of new information | journal = Virology | volume = 434 | issue = 2 | pages = 202–9 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23123013 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2012.10.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== &lt;big&gt;Patent Landscape&lt;/big&gt; ==
As of November 2018, CRISPR-Cas9 patent landscape is dominated by universities and research institutes over commercial companies. US and Chinese academic institutions are actively pursuing research activities in CRISPR domain. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) holds the largest patent portfolio in CRISPR-Cas9 technology with 103 IP assets. Several new Chinese players like University of China Agricultural, University of Shanghai Jiao Tong, University of Northwest A&amp;F, and Institute of Genetics &amp; Developmental Biology, CAS have been key applicants from 2015 onward.

CRISP-Cas9 landscape is witnessing novel inventions every single day. Several academic and corporate researchers are using CRISPR mechanism in various applications and coming up with the new innovation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://patentanalysis.org/patent-landscape-market-research-report-crispr-cas9-tools/|title=Patent Landscape Market Research Report CRISPR Cas9 Tools|work=Patent Analysis Reports and Techniques|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fields of [[computer security]] and [[information technology]], '''computer security incident management''' involves the monitoring and detection of security events on a [[computer]] or [[computer network]], and the execution of proper responses to those events. Computer security incident management is a specialized form of [[incident management]], the primary purpose of which is the development of a well understood and predictable response to damaging events and computer intrusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incident management requires a process and a response team which follows this process.  This definition of computer security incident management follows the standards and definitions described in the National Incident Management System (NIMS). The [[#Definitions|''incident coordinator'']] manages the response to an emergency security incident.  In a Natural Disaster or other event requiring response from Emergency services, the ''incident coordinator'' would act as a liaison to the emergency services incident manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Overview ==
Computer security incident management is an administrative function of managing and protecting computer assets, networks and information systems.  These systems continue to become more critical to the personal and economic welfare of our society.  Organizations (public and private sector groups, associations and enterprises) must understand their responsibilities to the public good and to the welfare of their memberships and stakeholders.  This responsibility extends to having a management program for “what to do, when things go wrong.”  Incident management is a program which defines and implements a process that an organization may adopt to promote its own welfare and the security of the public.

== Components of an incident ==

=== Events ===
An event is an observable change to the normal behavior of a system, environment, process, workflow or person (components).  There are three basic types of events:
# Normal—a normal event does not affect critical components or require change controls prior to the implementation of a resolution.  Normal events do not require the participation of senior personnel or management notification of the event.
# Escalation – an escalated event affects critical production systems or requires that implementation of a resolution that must follow a change control process.  Escalated events require the participation of senior personnel and stakeholder notification of the event.
# Emergency – an emergency is an event which may
## impact the health or safety of human beings
## breach primary controls of critical systems
## materially affect component performance or because of impact to component systems prevent activities which protect or may affect the health or safety of individuals
## be deemed an emergency as a matter of policy or by declaration by the available incident coordinator
Computer security and information technology personnel must handle emergency events according to well-defined computer security incident response plan.

=== Incident ===
An incident is an event attributable to a human root cause.  This distinction is particularly important when the event is the product of malicious intent to do harm.  An important note: all incidents are events but many events are not incidents.  A system or application failure due to age or defect may be an emergency event but a random flaw or failure is not an incident.

=== Incident response team ===
The security ''incident coordinator'' manages the response process and is responsible for assembling the team.  The coordinator will ensure the team includes all the individuals necessary to properly assess the incident and make decisions regarding the proper course of action.  The incident team meets regularly to review status reports and to authorize specific remedies.  The team should utilize a pre-allocated physical and virtual meeting place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | url =http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/csirt-handbook.pdf
  | accessdate =2007-04-08  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incident investigation ===
The investigation seeks to determine the circumstances of the incident.  Every incident will warrant or require an investigation.   However, investigation resources like forensic tools, dirty networks, quarantine networks and consultation with law enforcement may be useful for the effective and rapid resolution of an emergency incident.

== Process ==

=== Initial incident management process ===
[[Image:Computer-security-incident-initial-process(high-res).png|thumb|250px|right|Author: Michael Berman (tanjstaffl)]]
# Employee, vendor, customer, partner, device or sensor reports event to ''Help Desk''.
# Prior to creating the ticket, the help desk may filter the event as a false positive.  Otherwise, the help desk system creates a ticket that captures the event, event source, initial event severity and event priority.
## The ticket system creates a unique ID for the event.  IT Personnel must use the ticket to capture email, IM and other informal communication.
## Subsequent activities like change control, incident management reports and compliance reports must reference the ticket number.
## In instances where event information is “Restricted Access,” the ticket must reference the relevant documents in the secure document management system.
# The ''First Level Responder'' captures additional event data and performs preliminary analysis.  The First Responder determines criticality of the event.  At this level, it is either a Normal or an Escalation event.
## Normal events do not affect critical production systems or require change controls prior to the implementation of a resolution.
## Events that affect critical production systems or require change controls must be escalated.
## Organization management may request an immediate escalation without first level review – 2nd tier will create ticket.
# The event is ready to resolve.  The resource enters the resolution and the problem category into the ticket and submits the ticket for closure.
# The ticket owner (employee, vendor, customer or partner) receives the resolution.  They determine that the problem is resolved to their satisfaction or escalate the ticket.
# The escalation report is updated to show this event and the ticket is assigned a second tier resource to investigate and respond to the event.
# The Second Tier resource performs additional analysis and re-evaluates the criticality of the ticket.  When necessary, the Second Tier resource is responsible for implementing a change control and notifying IT Management of the event.
# Emergency Response:
## Events may follow the escalation chain until it is determined that an emergency response is necessary.
## Top-level organization management may determine that an emergency response is necessary and invoke this process directly.

=== Emergency response detail ===
[[Image:Computer-security-emergency-response-process(high-res).png|thumb|250px|right|Author: Michael Berman (tanjstaffl)]]
# Emergency response is initiated by escalation of a security event or be direct declaration by the CIO or other executive organization staff.  The CIO may assign the incident coordinator, but by default, the coordinator will be the most senior security staff member available at the time of the incident.
# The incident coordinator assembles the incident response team.  The team meets using a pre-defined conference meeting space.  One of the (CIO, CSO or Director IT) must attend each incident team meeting.
# The meeting minutes capture the status, actions and resolution(s) for the incident.  The incident coordinator reports on the cost, exposure and continuing business risk of the incident.  The incident response team determines the next course of action.
# Lock-down and Repair – Perform the actions necessary to prevent further damage to the organization, repair impacted systems and perform changes to prevent a re-occurrence.
# False Positive – The incident team determines this issue did not warrant an emergency response.  The team provides a written report to senior management and the issue is handled as either a normal incident or it is closed.
# Monitor and Capture – Perform a thorough investigation with continued monitoring to detect and capture the perpetrator.  This process must include notification to the following senior and professional staff:
## CEO and CFO
## Corporate Attorney and Public Relations
# Review and analyze log data to determine nature and scope of incident.  This step should include utilizing virus, spyware, rootkit and other detection tools to determine necessary mitigation and repair.
# Repair systems, eliminate vector(s) of attack, and mitigate exploitable vulnerabilities.
# The ''Test Report'' documents the validation of the repair process.
## Test systems to ensure compliance with policy and risk mitigation.
## Perform additional repairs to resolve all current vulnerabilities.
# Investigate incident to determine source of attack and capture perpetrator.  This will require the use of forensics tools, log analysis, clean lab and dirty lab environments and possible communication with Law Enforcement or other outside entities.
# The “Investigation Status Report” as captures all current information regarding the incident.  The Incident response team uses this information to determine the next course of action.  (See Ref 2 and Ref 3)

== Definitions ==
;First Responder/First level review: first person to be on scene or receive notification of an event, organizations should provide training to the first responder to recognize and properly react to emergency circumstances.

'''Incident Response Steps'''
'''Detection'''- An incident can be detected by a sensor, a network analyst or a user reporting something unusual with his/her PC.
'''Containment'''- In the event of malicious network traffic or a computer virus, the Incident Response Manager should stop the traffic by taking the computer off the network.
'''Clean'''- Run a virus scan to remove the virus or wipe the computer clean and reimage the machine.
'''Reverse Engineering'''- Use [[computer forensics]] tools to understand why the malicious traffic occurred in the first place.  Once the incident is completely understood make plans to decrease your future risk.

'''Contemporary Sant Mat Movements''' are [[esoteric]] philosophy movements active in the United States, Europe, [[Latin America]], and especially India. These movements assert that [[Sant Mat]] shares a lineage with [[Sikhism]] and contains elements of thought found in [[Hinduism]], such as [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]]. They further assert that Sant Mat also contains elements found in [[Sufism]] and has inspired and influenced a number of religious groups and organizations. They refer to this spiritual path as the "Science of the Soul" or ‘[[Sant Mat]]’, meaning ‘teachings of the saints’. More recently it has been described as "The Way of Life" or "Living the Life of Soul." It incorporates a practical [[yoga]] system known as [[Surat Shabd Yoga]].

Contemporary Sant Mat movements claim to incorporate a personal and private path of spiritual development in the common tradition of mystics past and present. They discuss the irrelevance of rituals, priestly class, mandatory contributions, or compulsory gatherings.

==Introduction==
The basic teaching of contemporary Sant Mat, as described by its Masters, is that everything lies inside us and that God is within. The outside world is only an image or a reflection of the inner reality.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Thakar (1989). Newspaper interview, Lagos Nigeria. Reprinted in Heart Of Compassion, Kirpal Light Satsang, 1991 {{ISBN|0-917019-11-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; So self-knowledge or knowledge of the higher self and God-knowledge (taken as a practical project rather than a theoretical inquiry) are the topics of Sant Mat.&lt;ref name="link2"&gt;Singh, Kirpal (1955). Night Is A Jungle, Ruhani Satsang Books. [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/god_man.htm Online_version].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kirpal Singh]] describes [[Sant Mat]] as a synonym for ''[[Surat Shabd Yoga]]'', the [[yoga]] of the [[Sound Current]], or more simply ''Shabd yoga'', a meditation technique he asserts was taught and practiced originally in northern India.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Kirpal. (1999). ''[http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/naam/contents.htm Naam or Word]''. Blaine, WA: Ruhani Satsang Books. {{ISBN|0-942735-94-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh writes that practitioners of Shabd yoga position the path as not requiring the physical torture of penance and austerities that marked many of the yogas and spiritual paths throughout the ages. Thus it is sometimes called "[[Sahaja|Sehaj]]" (easy) yoga.&lt;ref name="link5"&gt;Singh, Kirpal. Man Know Thyself. Ruhani Satsang Books. [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/knowthy.htm Online_version]&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely accepted translations of the Indian term "Sant Mat" are "Teachings of the Saints" and "Path of the Masters." These are both incidentally the titles of prominent works on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Kirpal (1976). The Way of the Saints: Sant Mat. Sant Bani ashram. {{ISBN|0-89142-026-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="link4"&gt;Johnson, Julian (1985). The Path of the Masters: The Science of Surat Shabd Yoga : The Yoga of the audible Life Stream. Radha Soami Satsang Beas. {{ISBN|1-199-61327-4}} (Originally published much earlier, perhaps in the 1950s.)&lt;/ref&gt; Another commonly accepted definition of the term is found in [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/knowthy.htm Man Know Thyself] by [[Sant Kirpal Singh]]:

:Man is constantly changing or introducing new names and terminologies to describe this Science. The Masters were called Sants, and the nature of knowledge Mat, thus giving us the term 'Sant-Mat', which is at present mostly used to name the Path of the Masters. Other terms, such as Shabd Yoga, Surat Shabd Yoga, Sehaj Yoga, are also used to describe the same Science. In the Sanskrit language, the word 'Sant' means Master of the highest Order, and 'Mat' is a confirmed opinion or statement made by an adept after personal experience. The foundation of this Science, therefore, is the result of a critical study, minute investigation, and the lifelong personal verification of facts based on practical experience of the Self in man. This experience of the Self is something that a competent Master is prepared to give to each individual who approaches him. Sant Mat, therefore, is the teaching, system and path of the Saints.&lt;ref name="link5" /&gt;

However, terminology, names, and groups are not considered to be of any importance in Sant Mat:

:The Masters do not attach any importance to names, designations, or the fact that many religious sects, groups and circles, have claimed this Science as their own and named it after their leaders or founders. They look upon these groups as schools where man — the noblest being in Creation — can study with other men as children of one and the same Almighty Father.&lt;ref name="link5" /&gt;

==Origins==
{{details|Sant Mat}}
Sant Mat (literally, "school of the [[Sant (India)|Sant]]s") was a loosely associated group of teachers that assumed prominence in the northern part of the Indian sub-continent from about the 13th century. Their teachings are distinguished theologically by inward loving devotion to a divine principle, and socially by an [[egalitarian]]ism opposed to the qualitative distinctions of the Hindu caste hierarchy and to the religious differences between Hinduism and Islam.&lt;ref name=Woodhead&gt;Woodhead, Linda &amp; Fletcher, Paul. ''Religion in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations'' (2001) pp.71-2. Routledge (UK) {{ISBN|0-415-21784-9}}"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical reach==
Contemporary Sant Mat movements exist all over the world.

[[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]], the mission begun by [[Baba Jaimal Singh]] at the turn of the 19th century, has its headquarters known as "Dera Baba Jaimal Singh", near the river [[Beas River|Beas]] in [[northern India]] since 1891. His Master [[Shiv Dayal Singh]] had perhaps 500 initiates, and if one wanted to see the Master it was necessary to travel to his home in Agra. His lineage continues at Radhasoami Central Satsang, at Dayalbagh, Agra, in India. Baba Jaimal Singh had perhaps 2500 initiates and did not travel more than a few hundred miles from Beas while he was a Master. Baba Sawan Singh did not travel outside of India, but is believed to have had as many as one lac (100,000) initiates, some of whom were foreigners. [[Charan Singh (guru)]] did travel overseas and the present master [[Gurinder Singh]], travels to nearly 90 countries.  Today the [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]], is leading the way forward and encompassing all the teachings of the saints.&lt;ref name="link4" /&gt;

[[Sant Kirpal Singh]] visited Europe and the United States in 1955 and 1963, and Europe, America, and Latin America in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/kirpal.htm Ruhani Satsang USA website, Tour reports]&lt;/ref&gt; The various spiritual leaders who claim to lead this movement now frequently travel all over the world.

==General tenets==
The most central tenet is the need to be initiated by a living Master or [[Satguru]] ("sat" meaning true and "guru" meaning Master or Spiritual Teacher). "Competent Master" is another common formulation: the Master must be competent in the sense of having been commissioned by God, not just a person who feels like working in the role of a guru:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a sad affair that there are thousands of imitators, of false copies, but it doesn't mean that the world is devoid of truth and that a Master is not available to the people...It has always been a law that at least one complete master would be on earth to bring God's truth to the people. One such Master can benefit the entire world just as one sun can glorify and light up the entire world. [16] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Technically speaking Sant Mat practice involves listening to the [[Shabd|Inner Sound]], also known in the Holy Bible as 'The Word' or 'logos' contemplating the [[Light (theology)|Inner Light]], and (eventually) [[Astral projection|leaving the human body at will]] - a practice sometimes referred to as "dying while living". The principal intent is to awaken the Soul and unite it with God.&lt;ref&gt;"My dear souls, I should call you souls because we are from God. It is told to us" 'Your soul bears the seal of God. It belongs to God, give it unto God.' These words from the Bible and other scriptures were told by God himself when he came into the human garb. He came because Man has been misled. God is the only one who has sympathy with these suffering souls. He wants to end their suffering: 'Come back to me. Enjoy perfection, as I am perfect.'" LTLOS, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Sant Mat is a practical and not a theoretical investigation.&lt;ref&gt;"The present day is an age of the practical life. People do not believe unless there is something practical. So we must have all our Truth in a practical way, and it will appeal to all. This Truth will prevail. Times are changing. This is the only thing that can appeal to everybody. This is the only ground on which all of us can sit together. So I wish each one of you to be practical. Do not try to reform others. Reform your own self." LOK [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/ocean.htm The Ocean of Intoxication].&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Sant Mat movements claim to be different in a radical sense from other disciplines or kinds of knowledge which can be taught. It claims to be a meta-knowledge or method of going beyond knowledge and deprecates the mind and mental processes, at all times describing a dichotomy between the mind and the soul, in which the mind is only a negative copy or imitation of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;"Anyone whose soul is under the mind's influence and control becomes an image of the mind, for he forgets his true self. We call this ego or I-hood for one thinks 'I am everything.' Yet, one does not know that true 'I.' If one has forgotten one's true Self, then who is it that will realize the Lord?" LOK [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/listen.htm Oh Mind, Listen For Once].&lt;/ref&gt; The mind is to become still and quiet so that the soul can begin to experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;"Once, I remember, a very learned pundit came to our Master. I was there. He had a talk with my Master. At the end he said, "Will you kindly initiate me?" He was initiated. Then he told the Master, "Master, I will become proficient within three months. I'll do everything You say and come back." Master said, "All right, what more is wanted?" He came back after six months, and fortunately I was there because I had the privilege to be back with the Master. He said, "Master, previously l had been putting in eight hours a day in worship, and my mind never disturbed me. Now I cannot sit for a moment." You see? It is because in the outward performances, the mind gets food. You light the candle, you offer flowers, then you do this and that. The mind gets food. But in this way, the mind meets its death. He would prefer to go into the mouth of a cannon rather than enter within." LOK [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/lok/servant.htm Are You The Servant Of Your Mind?]&lt;/ref&gt; The soul has its own internal sources of knowledge, and when properly connected to its inner sources, no outer education or knowledge is required or desired.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The second essential tenet is the mystical role of the Sound Current:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Prajapatir vai idam-agree asit Tasya vak dvitiya asit Vak vai Paramam Brahma''&lt;/blockquote&gt; (from Vedas)

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the beginning was [[Prajapati]] (the Creator),
With Him was the [[Vāk|Vak]] (the Word),
And the Vak (the Word) was verily the
Supreme [[Brahman]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proponents compare this with the verses of John 1 [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201;&amp;version=31 John] to assert their special use of comparative religion (seeking the common thread in all religions and esoteric phenomena). ''Naam or Word'' [http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/naam/contents.htm], written by [[Sant Kirpal Singh]], explores this theme. It asserts that the Sound Current is the esoteric form of God which is available to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;"When we meditate on that light of God and that music, we will find access to God himself. The music we hear in this outer world is the outer expression of that inner music. In the Jap Ji, twenty-seventh stanza, you will find Nanak marvelling at God's mansion...he says that in God's house he found all music, so many instruments, so many kinds and types of songs, and so many singers. Then Nanak further explains that all this universe, the Judge and air and fire and everything there is, is going on because of music....Everything is Music. God is also music and he controls everything with music." And You Will Fly Up To God (see [16]). p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The Guru, who is a human being, has merged with the Sound Current in such a manner that he is a living manifestation of it (the Word made flesh).&lt;ref name="link42"&gt;Way of Life, 2002. "'Word made flesh and dwelt amongst us.' The Word God came into this world in human flesh and began to dwell with us. Why? So that the competency of the Word God, who has created everything, maintains everything, and is full God, will work in this world in the same capacity as it works in the highest heavens. " p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not just the Guru can achieve this, but all human beings are inherently privileged in this way &lt;ref name="link42" /&gt;

===Helping factors===
Beyond the two main tenets, Contemporary Sant Mat movements emphasize an ethical lifestyle and selfless service. They assert that these are not spirituality as such, but are necessary preparation for true spirituality to commence.&lt;ref&gt;An Ethical Lifestyle, Selfless Service. Video tape recording, Edition Naam USA. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A self-introspective diary or daily diary tracking ethical lifestyle in five cardinal disciplines is sometimes recommended as a way to self-monitor one's own ethical condition. The five cardinal virtues tracked by
the diary are ''Ahimsa'' or [[Nonviolence]], Truthfulness, [[Chastity]], love for all regardless of caste, creed, wealth, or intellectual attainments (i.e., [[Humility]]), and finally the maintenance of a strict [[Vegetarian]] diet. Drugs and alcohol are also to be avoided, as is the company of worldly-minded people.&lt;ref name="link45"&gt;And You Will Fly Up To God, p. 57-75, "The Daily Diary".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Selfless Service]] or Seva means devoting oneself to mental, physical, or financial service to the Guru, and the sangat (or devotees).  Mental service means keeping constant remembrance of God by means of repetition of the Mantra (known as [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|Simran]]) or by other means keeping the Guru in mind. Physical service means doing some physical work, as in the situation where one helps dig a well at an ashram or gives a talk about the Master to the public. Financial service means giving money to the mission of the Master (to his organization) instead of spending it on oneself. The concept of Financial Seva is quite similar to [[tithe|tithing]] as known generally in Christianity. Also, just as a very general rule, at least 10% of one's time should be spent in meditation.&lt;ref name="link45" /&gt;

===Practices===
Contemporary Sant Mat movements assert that the "Master" or [[Guru]] is provided by God as the channel through which God manifests in the world - God is believed to be unknowable and inconceivable, so he has created Gurus as a way in which to be available. Only humans are capable of interacting with a Master, as other forms of life are asserted to be incapable of doing so.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Teachers of contemporary Sant Mat movements claim to teach a spiritual path which is intentionally easier than others described in the ancient scriptures as it requires nothing more than sitting quietly and looking and listening within.  {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Specifics of this process include connecting one's soul or attention, called ''[[Surat (soul)]]'' with the inner Current of Light and Sound of God, the [[Shabd]]. Adherents believe this Sound Current cannot be heard by the uninitiated; it is made manifest at the time of initiation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} An essential component of the practice involves sitting still with eyes closed, with one's attention focused at the "third eye center", located between and behind the two eyebrows, while (mentally) repeating one or more [[mantra]]s given by the Guru to the disciple at the time of initiation. This is called [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|simran]] (repetition) and its primary function is to still the mind while remembering (or being connected to) the Guru via the mantra he provided. However listening to the Sound Current by plugging the ears with the thumbs and listening at the right side or above is equally as important. Sound is considered to be the source of the Light, and to contain everything required. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The concept of [[Satsang]] is also a common thread in contemporary Sant Mat movements' practices. Satsang means literally "gathering of Truth." These gatherings serve as the formal meeting place of the Master and his devotees when he is present in physical form, but also, more often, follow the tradition of early Christianity and take place in the homes of disciples or in any convenient location as times of remembrance of the Master and the need for meditation.&lt;ref&gt;"You may also gather together in one of your homes to listen to one of Master's tapes or read from the religious scriptures or talk about Master's mission or His teachings. That will also be a satsang." And You Will Fly Up to God, p. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary Sant Mat movements, not everyone automatically qualifies for [[Initiation]]; many teachers require that prospective followers be spiritually “ready”. This was especially true in earlier times, when people made more time available. There are definite criteria for judging whether or not a person is indeed ready for initiation: they must be ready to eschew drugs and alcohol, lead a disciplined and chaste lifestyle, avoid spiritual healing and other forms of meditation, and commit to several hours of meditation per day.&lt;ref name="link2" /&gt;

==Sects==
There are many sects within contemporary Sant Mat movements, with different leaders and varying belief systems. Examples include [[Radha Soami Satsang Beas]], [[Radha Swami Satsang, Dinod]] and the [[Sawan Kirpal Ruhani Mission]].

The work of [[David C. Lane]] provides a partial catalogue of various sects related to the Radha Soami Satsang Beas and attempts to study their formation from a socio-economic point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, David, [http://elearn.mtsac.edu/dlane/radhabook.html The Radhasoami tradition: A Critical History of Guru Successorship]'' (1992).  Garland Publishers, New York {{ISBN|0-8240-5247-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Juergensmeyer]] has also extensively studied groups related to Radha Soami Satsang Beas.&lt;ref&gt;Juergensmeyer, Mark.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=slX3eRycszMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Radha+Soami#PPP9,M1 Excerpts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other contemporary movements described as having a Sant Mat origin==
The [[Quan Yin Method]] of meditation promoted though the spiritual teachings of [[Supreme Master Ching Hai]] also has notable similarities to Sant Mat. The religious movement [[Eckankar]] is considered by some to be an offshoot of the Sant Mat tradition. Paul Twitchell, who founded Eckankar, was an initiate of Sant [[Kirpal Singh]].

The [[Divine Light Mission]], founded by [[Hans Ji Maharaj]] and succeeded by his sons Guru Maharaj Ji ([[Prem Rawat]]) and [[Satpal Maharaj]], was characterized as part of the Sant Mat tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Kranenborg, Reender (Dutch language) ''Neohindoeïstische bewegingen in Nederland : een encyclopedisch overzicht'', published by Kampen Kok cop.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4103">'''Continued process verification''' (CPV) is the collection and analysis of end-to-end production components and processes data to ensure product outputs are within predetermined quality limits. In 2011 the [[Food and Drug Administration]] published a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Process Validation: General Principles and Practices |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/UCM070336.pdf |publisher=FDA |accessdate= 3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlining best practices regarding business process validation in the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. Continued process verification is outlined in this report as the third stage in [[process validation]]. Its central purpose is to ensure that processes are in a constant state of control, thus ensuring final product quality. Central to effective CPV is a method with which to identify unwanted process inconsistencies in order to execute corrective or preventative measures. Once quality standards are set in place they must be monitored with regular frequency to confirm those parameters are being met. Continued process verification not only helps protect consumers from production faults, but business also see benefits in implementing a CPV program. Should product outputs not match target standards it can be very costly to investigate the problem source without existing CPV data.

==Vital components of continued process verification==
* An alert system to identify process malfunctions that lead to deviations from quality standards. 
* A framework for gathering and analyzing data of final product quality and process consistency.  Analysis should include source materials consistency and manufacturing equipment condition; and data should be collected in a format that allows for long term trend analysis as well as intra-production quality analysis.
* Continued review of quality qualification standards and process reliability. Departures from any predetermined standards should be flagged for review by trained personnel and appropriate measures undertaken to restore end-to-end quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trust but Verify (Continuously)|url=http://www2.emersonprocess.com/siteadmincenter/PM%20Articles/ART-Trust-but-Verify.pdf|publisher=Pharmaceutical Manufacturing|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data collection and analysis==
Crucial in effective CPV implementation is an appropriate data collection procedure. Data must allow for statistical analytics and trend analysis of process consistency and capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continued Process Verification (CPV)|url=http://www.atris-systems.com/216.0.html|publisher=Atris Information Systems|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A correctly implemented procedure will minimize overreactions to individual production outlier events and guarantee genuine process inconsistency are detected. While production variability can sometimes be obvious and even casually identified the FDA recommends using statistical tools to quantitatively detect problems and identify root causes. Initially, continued process verification should be based on quality standards established in the design phase. After a period of time variations can be detected by identifying deviation from historical data using statistical tools. Furthermore, these same tools can also be used to identify opportunities to optimize processes that may pre-emptively increase quality reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Case for Stage 3 Continued Process Verification|url=http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2014/stage3-continued-process-verification|publisher=Pharmaceutical Manufacturing|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The '''Corrected d-exponent''', also known as cd-exponent or more correctly dc-exponent (d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-exponent) as used in [[mud logging]] and formation pore pressure analysis in the [[oil industry]], is an extrapolation of certain drilling parameters to estimate a [[pressure gradient]] for pore pressure evaluation while drilling. Normally this is done in over-pressured zones, but most [[mud logging]] contracts require it to be done at all times. It is regarded as one of the best tools for pore pressure evaluation. See '''[[mud log]]''' for an example of the '''corrected d-exponent''' plotted on a mud log. The parameter is an extension ("correction", hence the "&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;" notation) to the '''d-exponent''' method previously used for estimating formation pore pressures. The extension consists of a correction for the mud weight in use, compared to "standard" mud for the region.

The parameters used to calculate '''d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-exponent''' values are: [[rate of penetration|drilling rate]] (ROP), rotary speed, weight on bit, bit diameter and mud weight; it is plotted against drilled depth.

==Theory==
As a drill bit bores into rock, it will gradually encounter denser formations and therefore slower '''''[[rate of penetration|rates of penetration]]'''''. (Though there are exceptions such as sands that normally drill faster, or faulted and uplifted formations). The general trend is normally a gradually slowing ''rate of penetration''.

Sands may have above them an impermeable layer of formation, normally [[shale]], that may be hundreds of metres thick. When gas or fluids migrate up through the sand and reach this impermeable layer, pressure may build up in the sand and push up against the impermeable layer of shale. Over time the pressure can becomes so great that it begins to fracture the shale, making it weaker and easier to penetrate by a drill bit. When a hole is drilled down towards this sand, it will gradually begin to experience faster ''rates of penetration'' as it drills through this shale gets closer to the high-pressure sand. It is this trend that the dc-exponent exposes. An examination of the fractured shale that is being drilled will reveal increasingly larger [[wikt:concave|concave]] pieces.  This is where the term [[pressure shale]] comes from.

==Calculation==
The basic drillability exponent was published in 1966 by Jorden &amp; Shirley relating the action of tricone bit teeth to an inherent characteristic of the rock, the ''drillability'', or 'd' :

d = log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(R/60N)/log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(12W/10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;D)

where :
R=ROP (ft/hr)     N=RPM (rev/min)    W=WOB (lbs)       D=bit size (ins)

In 1971, Rehm and McClendon (1971) defined the corrected d exponent to account for changes in mud weight where  d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-exponent is defined as

d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-exponent = MW1/MW2 * ''d''

and where :

dc      =   modified d exponent    ;   MW1  =    normal pressure gradient  ; MW2  =   mud weight (preferably ECD)
ECD, Equivalent circulating density is the hydrodynamic pressure experienced at the cutting face of the bit due to the combination of mud density, fluid viscosity, borehole wall friction and cuttings load act to increase the pressure. This can be estimated by calculations, but it has become common in recent years to use a direct-measuring annulus probe in the [[Measurement while drilling|MWD]] tools string (if there is one).

==Caveats==
As with all matters relating to pore pressure analysis, the method cannot be applied blindly. In particular, models and constants need to be adjusted to the particular basin being drilled. The method was developed for the delta of the Mississippi/ Missouri river system in the United States, and works reasonably well there. However, basins with different sediment sources cannot be assumed to have the same compaction profiles (because they may have different depositional clay mineralogy). Basins with different pore fluid chemistry will have differing hydrostatic pressure profiles, leading to different d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-exponent profiles. The presence of post-depositional carbonate cements in mudrocks will make formations appear abnormally hard to drill. In particular, the use of PDC-type bits with a shearing cutting action (instead of the chipping action that Jorden &amp; Shirley (1966) assumed in their chip-holddown model) will lead to d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-exponent plots that differ from tricone or bi-cone bits in the same formations.
While doing wildcat exploration work in a region, the method can be applied "by the book", but after drilling the first well, one would need to carefully re-evaluate the data collected to try to improve the model for the particular basin in question.
While it can be used successfully, one must always validate the information presented by d&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-exponent plots by examining multiple other pore pressure indicators.

'''Covariational Conditional''' refers to the most commonly used "the X'er, the Y'er" structure in [[English language|English]], for example:
* "The more I think about it, the less I understand."
* "The sooner, the better."
The structure is composed of two [[Dependent and independent variables|variables]]: an independent variable ('the X'er') and a dependent variable ("the Y'er").&lt;ref name="LittlemoreTaylor2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeannette Littlemore|author2=John R.

In [[construction grammar]] this pattern is considered a construction because the pattern is not predictable from any other fact of [[English grammar]] already established about 'the'.

'The normally occurs with a head noun but in this construction it requires a comparative phrase. The two major phrases resist classification as either noun phrases or clauses. The requirement that two phrases of this type be juxtaposed is another non-predictable aspect of the pattern. Because the pattern is not strictly predictable, a construction must be
posited that specifies the particular form and function involved' ([[Adele Goldberg (linguist)|Goldberg]] 2006, 6).&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, A. E. (2006). Constructions at Work The nature of generalization in language. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of History and Philosophy of Science''' ('''HPS'''), of the [[University of Cambridge]] is the largest department of [[History and Philosophy of Science]] in the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} It received a maximum rating of 4* for the majority of its submissions to the RAE 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rae.ac.uk/submissions/submission.aspx?id=60&amp;type=uoa&amp;subid=2533 RAE 2008] University of Cambridge: Philosophy: History and Philosophy of Science. Retrieved 6 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Located in the historic buildings of the Old Physical Chemistry Laboratories on [[Free School Lane]], [[Cambridge]], the Department teaches undergraduate courses towards the Cambridge [[Tripos]] and graduate courses including a taught Masters and PhD supervision in the field of HPS.  The Department shares its premises with the [[Whipple Museum]] and Whipple Library which provide important teaching resources for its teaching and research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/dept/ 'About the Department'] HPS Cambridge. Retrieved 5 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic staff==
The Department of HPS at Cambridge employs twelve full-time teaching staff, approximately thirty research staff, numerous supervisors and research associates from departments and colleges across the [[University of Cambridge]], in addition to external supervisors and examiners. Until 2013 the head of department was Professor [[John Forrester (historian)|John Forrester]], an international authority in the [[History of Mind]], and a leading figure on [[Sigmund Freud]] and the history of [[psychoanalysis]]. The current head of department is Professor Jim Secord. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.people.hps.cam.ac.uk/index/teaching-officers/secord&lt;/ref&gt;Other teaching staff include, Professor [[Hasok Chang]], Dr [[Eleanor Robson]], Professor [[Simon Schaffer]], Dr [[Tim Lewens]] and Dr [[Patricia Fara]].  [[Emeritus Professor]] [[Nicholas Jardine]] retired from full-time teaching duties in the summer of 2010.

==Degree courses==
The Department offers a nine-month MPhil course in History, Philosophy and Sociology of Science, Medicine and Technology (formerly History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine).  It also supervises graduate students for the Cambridge PhD in HPS and provides  advisors in the related fields of research in History, Philosophy and Social Science.  The Department provides undergraduate teaching and supervision for students who have completed their first year at Cambridge.  Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the Cambridge Tripos system, undergraduates from a wide range of fields may study HPS.  The resources of the [[Whipple Museum]] provide for first-hand study of scientific instruments which often provide topics for student dissertations.

==History of medicine==
In recent years, the Department has regained its position as a major{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} centre for the study of the [[History of Medicine]] having formerly been a [[Wellcome]] Unit in this field.  It has played a major{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} role in the [[Wellcome Trust]] funded ''Generation to Reproduction'' project at Cambridge, led by Dr Nick Hopwood, and hosted seminars and day conferences in this field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/medicine/ HPS: History of Medicine'].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14092">'''Entheogenic drugs''' have been used by various groups for thousands of years. There are numerous
historical reports as well as modern, contemporary reports of indigenous groups using [[entheogen]]s, [[chemical substance]]s used in a [[religion|religious]], [[shamanism|shamanic]], or [[spirituality|spiritual]] context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology - Jurema-Preta (Mimosa tenuiflora [Willd.] Poir.): a review of its traditional use, phytochemistry and pharmacology |publisher=scielo.br |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-89132008000500010&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya, Olmecs, and Aztecs have well-documented entheogenic complexes. North American cultures also have a tradition of entheogens. In South America, especially in Peru, the archaeological study of cultures like Chavin, Cupisnique, Nasca and Moche, have demonstrated the use of entheogens through archaeobotanical, iconographic and paraphernalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharon|first1=Douglas | author-link1=Douglas Sharon|title=Shamanism &amp; the sacred cactus: ethnoarchaeological evidence for San Pedro use in northern Perú|date=2000|publisher=San Diego Museum of Man|location=San Diego|isbn=978-0937808740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olmec entheogens===
The [[Olmec]] (12,000 BCE to 400 BCE) lived in Central America and are largely viewed by many as the mother culture of Aztecs and Maya. The Olmecs left no written works on their belief structures, so many interpretations on Olmec beliefs are largely based on interpretations of murals and artifacts. Archaeologists state three reasons for believing that the Olmecs used entheogens:

#Burials of [[Bufo|Bufo toads]] with priests
#The use of entheogens in later Olmec-inspired cultures
#Sculptures of shamans and other figures have strong [[Therianthrope|Therianthropic]] imagery.

===Maya===
The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] (250 BCE to 900 CE) flourished in Central America and were prevalent even until the arrival of the Spanish. The Maya religious tradition was complex and well-developed. Unlike the Olmec, the Maya had religious texts that survived to this day. The Maya religion displayed characteristic Mesoamerican mythology, with a strong emphasis on an individual being a communicator between the physical world and the spiritual world. Mushroom stone effigies, dated to 1000 BCE, give evidence that mushrooms were at least revered in a religious way.

The late Maya archaeologist, Dr Stephan F. de Borhegyi, (better known by his contemporaries as Borhegyi) published the first of several articles in which he proposed the existence of a Mesoamerican mushroom cult in the Guatemalan highlands as early as 1000 B.C  This cult, which was associated from its beginnings with ritual human decapitation, a trophy head cult, warfare and the Mesoamerican ballgame, appears to have had its origins along the Pacific coastal piedmont. Borhegyi developed this proposition after finding a significant number of small, mushroom-shaped sculptures in the collections of the Guatemala National Museum and in numerous private collections in and around Guatemala City. While the majority of these small stone sculptures were of indeterminate provenance, a sufficient number had been found during the course of archaeological investigations as to permit him to determine approximate dates and to catalog them stylistically (Borhegyi de, S.F., 1957b,  "Mushroom Stones of Middle America," in Mushrooms, Russia and History  by [[Valentina Pavlovna Wasson|Valentina P. Wasson]] and [[R. Gordon Wasson]], eds. N.T.)

Quoting archaeologist Stephan F. de Borhegyi:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;"My assignment for the so-called mushroom cult, earliest 1,000 B.C., is based on the excavations of  Kidder and  Shook at the Verbena cemetery at Kaminaljuyu. The mushroom stone found in this Pre-Classic grave, discovered in Mound E-III-3, has a circular groove on the cap. There are also a number of yet unpublished mushroom stone specimens in the Guatemalan Museum from Highland Guatemala where the pottery association would indicate that they are Pre-Classic. In each case the mushroom stone fragments has a circular groove on the top. Mushroom stones found during the Classic and Post-Classic periods do not have circular grooves. This was the basis on which I prepared the chart on mushroom stones which was then subsequently published by the Wassons. Based on Carbon 14 dates and stratigraphy, some of these  Pre-Classic finds can be dated as early as 1,000 B.C. The reference is in the following".....(see Shook, E.M. &amp; Kidder, A.V., 1952. Mound E-III-3, Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala; Contributions to American Anthropology &amp; History No. 53 from Publ. 596, Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C. (letter from de Borhegyi to Dr. Robert Ravicz, MPM archives December 1st 1960 )&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most direct evidence of Maya entheogen use comes from modern descendents of the Maya who use entheogenic drugs today.

===Aztec===
The [[Aztec entheogenic complex]] is extremely well documented. Through historical evidence, there is proof that the Aztecs used several forms of psychoactive drugs. These drugs include Ololiuqui (the seed of Rivea corymbosa), Teonanácatl (translated as “mushroom of the gods," a psilocybe mushroom) and sinicuichi (a flower added to drinks). The [[Xochipilli]] statue, according to R.G. Wasson, gives the identity of several entheogenic plants. Other evidence for entheogenic use of the Aztecs comes from the Florentine Codex, a series of 12 books vividly describing the Aztec culture and society, including the use of entheogenic drugs.

===Native Americans of the southwest United States===
There are several contemporary indigenous groups who use entheogens, most notably Native Americans of the southwest United States. Various tribes from California have been known to use strong alcoholic drinks as well as peyote to achieve visions and religious experiences.

==Old World==

=== Paleolithic===
During the [[Paleolithic]], there is ample evidence of drug use as seen by preserved botanical remains and coprolites. Some scholars had suggested that the "Flower Burial" in [[Shanidar Cave]], a Paleolithic site in Iraq, was evidence of a shamanic death ritual, but more recent evidence and analysis has contradicted that claim. The most direct evidence we have from the Paleolithic in terms of art comes from [[Tassili n'Ajjer|Tassili, Algeria]] cave paintings depicting ''[[Psilocybe mairei]]'' mushrooms&lt;ref name="New Scientist" /&gt; dated 7000 to 9000 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saromini|first1=Giorgio|title=The Oldest Representation of Hallucinogenic Mushrooms in the World|journal=Integration: Journal for Mind-Moving Plants and Culture|date=1992|volume=1|issue=2/3|url=http://www.samorini.it/doc1/sam/sam-1992-sahara.pdf|accessdate=18 September 2017}} Reprinted at [http://www.artepreistorica.com/2009/12/the-oldest-representations-of-hallucinogenic-mushrooms-in-the-world-sahara-desert-9000-%E2%80%93-7000-b-p/nggallery/thumbnails/ ArtePreistorica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; before present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=Gaston|title=New Taxonomical and Ethnomycological Observations on Psilocybe S.S.

There are several Paleolithic sites that display therianthropic imagery. However, there is some debate as to whether or not sites like Lascaux or Chauvet were entheogenically inspired.

==Error tolerance (PAC learning)==
In [[Probably approximately correct learning|PAC learning]], '''error tolerance''' refers to the ability of an [[algorithm]] to learn when the examples received have been corrupted in some way. In fact, this is a very common and important issue since in many applications it is not possible to access noise-free data. Noise can interfere with the learning process at different levels: the algorithm may receive data that have been occasionally mislabeled, or the inputs may have some false information, or the classification of the examples may have been maliciously adulterated.

==Notation and the Valiant learning model==
In the following, let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be our &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional input space. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; be a class of functions that we wish to use in order to learn a &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;-valued target function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; defined over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; be the distribution of the inputs over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The goal of a learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is to choose the best function &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; such that it minimizes &lt;math&gt;error(h) = P_{x \sim \mathcal{D} }( h(x) \neq f(x))&lt;/math&gt;. Let us suppose we have a function &lt;math&gt;size(f)&lt;/math&gt; that can measure the complexity of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt; Oracle(x)&lt;/math&gt; be an oracle that, whenever called, returns an example &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and its correct label &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

When no noise corrupts the data, we can define '''learning in the Valiant setting''':&lt;ref&gt;Valiant, L. G. (August 1985). ''[http://www.ijcai.org/Past%20Proceedings/IJCAI-85-VOL1/PDF/107.pdf Learning Disjunction of Conjunctions]''. In IJCAI (pp. 560–566).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valiant, Leslie G. "A theory of the learnable." Communications of the ACM 27.11 (1984): 1134–1142.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Definition:'''
We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is efficiently learnable using &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Leslie Valiant|Valiant]] setting if there exists a learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; that has access to &lt;math&gt; Oracle(x)&lt;/math&gt; and a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \varepsilon \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \delta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; it outputs, in a number of calls to the oracle bounded by &lt;math&gt;p\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},\frac{1}{\delta},n,size(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt; , a function &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1-\delta&lt;/math&gt; the condition &lt;math&gt;error(h) \leq \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

In the following we will define learnability of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; when data have suffered some modification.&lt;ref&gt;Laird, P. D. (1988). ''[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bfm%3A978-1-4613-1685-5%2F1.pdf Learning from good and bad data]''. Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kearns, Michael. "Efficient noise-tolerant learning from statistical queries." Journal of the ACM 45.6 (1998): 983–1006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunk, Clifford A., and Michael J. Pazzani. "An investigation of noise-tolerant relational concept learning algorithms." Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Machine Learning. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification noise==
In the classification noise model&lt;ref name = "kv"&gt;Kearns, M. J., &amp; Vazirani, U. V. (1994). An introduction to computational learning theory, chapter 5. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt; a '''noise rate''' &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \eta &lt; \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is introduced. Then, instead of &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x)&lt;/math&gt; that returns always the correct label of example &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, algorithm &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; can only call a faulty oracle &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\eta)&lt;/math&gt; that will flip the label of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with probability &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;. As in the Valiant case, the goal of a learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is to choose the best function &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; such that it minimizes &lt;math&gt;error(h) = P_{x \sim \mathcal{D} }( h(x) \neq f(x))&lt;/math&gt;. In applications it is difficult to have access to the real value of &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, but we assume we have access to its upperbound &lt;math&gt;\eta_B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Angluin, D., &amp; Laird, P. (1988). ''[http://Fhomepages.math.uic.edu/~lreyzin/f14_mcs548/angluin88b.pdf Learning from noisy examples]''. Machine Learning, 2(4), 343–370.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that if we allow the noise rate to be &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;, then learning becomes impossible in any amount of computation time, because every label conveys no information about the target function.

'''Definition:'''
We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is efficiently learnable using &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; in the '''classification noise model''' if there exists a learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; that has access to &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\eta)&lt;/math&gt; and a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \eta \leq \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;0\leq \varepsilon \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0\leq \delta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; it outputs, in a number of calls to the oracle bounded by &lt;math&gt;p\left(\frac{1}{1-2\eta_B}, \frac{1}{\varepsilon},\frac{1}{\delta},n,size(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt; , a function &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;  that satisfies with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1-\delta&lt;/math&gt; the condition &lt;math&gt;error(h) \leq \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statistical query learning==
Statistical Query Learning&lt;ref name = "kearns"&gt;Kearns, M. (1998). ''[www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/sq-journal.pdf Efficient noise-tolerant learning from statistical queries]''. Journal of the ACM, 45(6), 983–1006.&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of [[Active learning (machine learning)|active learning]] problem in which the learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; can decide if to request information about the likelihood &lt;math&gt;P_{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt; that a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; correctly labels example &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and receives an answer accurate within a tolerance &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Formally, whenever the learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; calls the oracle &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, it receives as feedback probability &lt;math&gt;Q_{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;Q_{f(x)} - \alpha \leq P_{f(x)} \leq Q_{f(x)} + \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition:'''
We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is efficiently learnable using &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; in the '''statistical query learning model''' if there exists a learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; that has access to &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and polynomials &lt;math&gt;p(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;r(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; such that for any  &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \varepsilon \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; the following hold:
# &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; can evaluate &lt;math&gt;P_{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt; in time &lt;math&gt;q\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},n,size(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded by &lt;math&gt;r\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},n,size(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; outputs a model &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;err(h)&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, in a number of calls to the oracle bounded by &lt;math&gt;p\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},n,size(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the confidence parameter &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; does not appear in the definition of learning. This is because the main purpose of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is to allow the learning algorithm a small probability of failure due to an unrepresentative sample. Since now &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; always guarantees to meet the approximation criterion &lt;math&gt;Q_{f(x)} - \alpha \leq P_{f(x)} \leq Q_{f(x)} + \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the failure probability is no longer needed.

The statistical query model is strictly weaker than the PAC model: any efficiently SQ-learnable class is efficiently PAC learnable in the presence of classification noise, but there exist efficient PAC-learnable problems such as [[Parity (mathematics)|parity]] that are not efficiently SQ-learnable.&lt;ref name = "kearns" /&gt;

==Malicious classification==
In the malicious classification model&lt;ref&gt;Kearns, M., &amp; Li, M. (1993). ''[www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/malicious.pdf Learning in the presence of malicious errors]''. SIAM Journal on Computing, 22(4), 807–837.&lt;/ref&gt; an adversary generates errors to foil the learning algorithm. This setting describes situations of [[Burst error|error burst]], which may occur when for a limited time transmission equipment malfunctions repeatedly. Formally, algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; calls an oracle &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; that returns a correctly labeled example &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; drawn, as usual, from distribution &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; over the input space with probability &lt;math&gt;1- \beta&lt;/math&gt;, but it returns with probability &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; an example drawn from a distribution that is not related to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Moreover, this maliciously chosen example may strategically selected by an adversary who has knowledge of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, or the current progress of the learning algorithm.

'''Definition:'''
Given a bound &lt;math&gt;\beta_B&lt;  \frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \beta &lt; \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, we say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is efficiently learnable using &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; in the malicious classification model, if there exist a learning algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; that has access to &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; and a polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; such that for any  &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \varepsilon \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \delta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; it outputs, in a number of calls to the oracle bounded by &lt;math&gt;p\left(\frac{1}{1/2 - \beta_B},\frac{1}{\varepsilon},\frac{1}{\delta},n,size(f)\right)&lt;/math&gt; , a function &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;  that satisfies with probability at least &lt;math&gt;1-\delta&lt;/math&gt; the condition &lt;math&gt;error(h) \leq \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

==Errors in the inputs: nonuniform random attribute noise==
In the nonuniform random attribute noise&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, S. A., &amp; Robert, H. (1991). Sloan. The difficulty of random attribute noise. Technical Report WUCS 91 29, Washington University, Department of Computer Science.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, R. H. (1989). ''[http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/38339/20770411.pdf?sequence=1 Computational learning theory: New models and algorithms]'' (Doctoral dissertation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology).&lt;/ref&gt; model the algorithm is learning a [[Boolean function]], a malicious oracle &lt;math&gt;Oracle(x,\nu)&lt;/math&gt; may flip each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th bit of example &lt;math&gt;x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; independently with probability &lt;math&gt;\nu_i \leq \nu&lt;/math&gt;.

This type of error can irreparably foil the algorithm, in fact the following theorem holds:

In the nonuniform random attribute noise setting, an algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; can output a function &lt;math&gt;h \in \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;error(h)&lt;\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; only if &lt;math&gt;\nu &lt; 2\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing''' ({{lang-de|{{no italics|'''Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung}}}}''', or '''BAM''') is a [[Germany|German]] material research institute.

==History==
Its historical origins start in 1870, a year before Germany was unified, as the ''Mechanisch-Technische Versuchsanstalt''. From 1904-19 there was the ''Königliches Materialprüfungsamt''. From 1920-45 there was the ''Staatliches Materialprüfungsamt'' (MPA) and from 1919-45 there was the ''Chemisch-Technische Reichsanstalt'' (CTR). 

In 1954 the ''Bundesanstalt für mechanische und chemische Materialprüfung'' was formed, becoming the ''Bundesanstalt für Materialprüfung'' in 1956. In 1969 it became a government agency (Bundesoberbehörde). In 1986 the name changed to ''Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung''.

==Function==
Within the interconnected fields of materials, chemistry, environment and safety, the main areas are:

* Statutory functions relating to technical safety in the public domain, especially as regards dangerous materials and substances
* Collaboration in developing statutory regulations, for example on safety standards and threshold values
* Advising the Federal Government and industry on safety aspects of materials and chemical technology
* The development and supply of reference materials and methods, in particular for chemical analysis and materials testing
* Assisting in the development of standards and technical regulations for the evaluation of substances, materials, structures and processes with reference to damage prediction and preservation of national economic values.

==Structure==
It is owned by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology. Its competences are to improve safety in technology and chemistry through research and development, testing, analysis, approvals, advice and information.

The headquarters in Berlin are near the [[Berlin Botanischer Garten station]].

===Departments===
The Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing is subdivided into departments and divisions. The staff sums up to about 1700 members.

* Analytical chemistry; reference materials
* Chemical safety engineering
* Containment systems for dangerous goods
* Materials and environment
* Materials engineering
* Materials protection and surface technologies
* Safety of structures
* [[Non-destructive testing]]
* Accreditation, Quality in Testing

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64383">'''Finite-difference time-domain''' or '''Yee's method''' (named after the Chinese American applied mathematician [[Kane S. Yee]], born 1934) is a [[numerical analysis]] technique used for modeling [[computational electrodynamics]] (finding approximate solutions to the associated system of [[differential equation]]s).  Since it is a [[time domain|time-domain]] method, FDTD solutions can cover a wide [[frequency]] range with a single [[computer simulation|simulation]] run, and treat nonlinear material properties in a natural way.

The FDTD method belongs in the general class of [[Discretization|grid]]-based differential numerical modeling methods ([[finite difference methods]]). The time-dependent [[Maxwell's equations]] (in [[Partial differential equation|partial differential]] form) are discretized using [[central difference|central-difference]] approximations to the space and time [[partial derivative]]s. The resulting [[finite difference method|finite-difference]] equations are solved in either software or hardware in a [[leapfrog integration|leapfrog]] manner:  the [[electric field]] [[vector component]]s in a volume of space are solved at a given instant in time; then the [[magnetic field]] vector components in the same spatial volume are solved at the next instant in time; and the process is repeated over and over again until the desired transient or steady-state electromagnetic field behavior is fully evolved.

== History ==
Finite difference schemes for time-dependent [[partial differential equation]]s (PDEs) have been employed for many years in [[computational fluid dynamics]] problems,&lt;ref name="vonneumann49" /&gt; including the idea of using centered finite difference operators on staggered grids in space and time to achieve second-order accuracy.&lt;ref name="vonneumann49" /&gt;
The novelty of Kane Yee's FDTD scheme, presented in his seminal 1966 paper,&lt;ref name="yee66" /&gt; was to apply centered finite difference operators on staggered grids in space and time for each electric and magnetic vector field component in Maxwell's curl equations.
The descriptor "Finite-difference time-domain" and its corresponding "FDTD" acronym were originated by [[Allen Taflove]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="taflove80" /&gt;
Since about 1990, FDTD techniques have emerged as primary means to computationally model many scientific and engineering problems dealing with [[electromagnetic wave]] interactions with material structures. Current FDTD modeling applications range from near-[[Direct current|DC]] (ultralow-frequency [[geophysics]] involving the entire Earth-[[ionosphere]] waveguide) through [[microwaves]] (radar signature technology, [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]], wireless communications devices, digital interconnects, biomedical imaging/treatment) to [[visible light]] ([[photonic crystal]]s, nano[[plasmon]]ics, [[soliton]]s, and [[biophotonics]]).&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;  In 2006, an estimated 2,000 FDTD-related publications appeared in the science and engineering literature (see [[#Popularity|Popularity]]). As of 2013, there are at least 25 commercial/proprietary FDTD software vendors; 13 free-software/[[Open source|open-source]]-software FDTD projects; and 2 freeware/closed-source FDTD projects, some not for commercial use (see [[#External links|External links]]).

== FDTD models and methods ==
When [[Maxwell's differential equations]] are examined, it can be seen that the change in the E-field in time (the time derivative) is dependent on the change in the H-field across space (the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]]).  This results in the basic FDTD time-stepping relation that, at any point in space, the updated value of the E-field in time is dependent on the stored value of the E-field and the numerical curl of the local distribution of the H-field in space.&lt;ref name="yee66" /&gt;

The H-field is time-stepped in a similar manner. At any point in space, the updated value of the H-field in time is dependent on the stored value of the H-field and the numerical curl of the local distribution of the E-field in space. Iterating the E-field and H-field updates results in a marching-in-time process wherein sampled-data analogs of the continuous electromagnetic waves under consideration propagate in a numerical grid stored in the computer memory.

[[Image:FDTD Yee grid 2d-3d.svg|thumb|right|450px|Illustration of a standard Cartesian Yee cell used for FDTD, about which electric and magnetic field vector components are distributed.&lt;ref name="yee66" /&gt; Visualized as a cubic [[voxel]], the electric field components form the edges of the cube, and the magnetic field components form the normals to the faces of the cube. A three-dimensional space lattice consists of a multiplicity of such Yee cells. An electromagnetic wave interaction structure is mapped into the space lattice by assigning appropriate values of permittivity to each electric field component, and permeability to each magnetic field component.]]
This description holds true for 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D FDTD techniques. When multiple dimensions are considered, calculating the numerical curl can become complicated. Kane Yee's seminal 1966 paper proposed spatially staggering the vector components of the E-field and H-field about rectangular unit cells of a Cartesian computational grid so that each E-field vector component is located midway between a pair of H-field vector components, and conversely.&lt;ref name="yee66" /&gt;  This scheme, now known as a '''Yee lattice''', has proven to be very robust, and remains at the core of many current FDTD software constructs.

Furthermore, Yee proposed a leapfrog scheme for marching in time wherein the E-field and H-field updates are staggered so that E-field updates are conducted midway during each time-step between successive H-field updates, and conversely.&lt;ref name="yee66" /&gt; On the plus side, this explicit time-stepping scheme avoids the need to solve simultaneous equations, and furthermore yields dissipation-free numerical wave propagation. On the minus side, this scheme mandates an upper bound on the time-step to ensure numerical stability.&lt;ref name="taflove75a" /&gt; As a result, certain classes of simulations can require many thousands of time-steps for completion.

=== Using the FDTD method ===
To implement an FDTD solution of Maxwell's equations, a computational domain must first be established. The computational domain is simply the physical region over which the simulation will be performed. The E and H fields are determined at every point in space within that computational domain. The material of each cell within the computational domain must be specified. Typically, the material is either free-space (air), [[metal]], or [[dielectric]].  Any material can be used as long as the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]], [[permittivity]], and [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] are specified.

The permittivity of dispersive materials in tabular form cannot be directly substituted into the FDTD scheme.
Instead, it can be approximated using multiple Debye, Drude, Lorentz or critical point terms.
This approximation can be obtained using open fitting programs&lt;ref name="fitting" /&gt; and does not necessarily have physical meaning.

Once the computational domain and the grid materials are established, a source is specified. The source can be current on a wire,  applied electric field or impinging plane wave.
In the last case FDTD can be used to simulate light scattering from arbitrary shaped objects, planar periodic structures at various incident angles,&lt;ref name="obl_it" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obl_sfdtd" /&gt; and photonic band structure of infinite periodic structures.&lt;ref name="TMatrix" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hao" /&gt;

Since the E and H fields are determined directly, the output of the simulation is usually the E or H field at a point or a series of points within the computational domain. The simulation evolves the E and H fields forward in time.

Processing may be done on the E and H fields returned by the simulation. Data processing may also occur while the simulation is ongoing.

While the FDTD technique computes electromagnetic fields within a compact spatial region, scattered and/or radiated far fields can be obtained via near-to-far-field transformations.&lt;ref name="umashankar82" /&gt;

=== Strengths of FDTD modeling ===
Every modeling technique has strengths and weaknesses, and the FDTD method is no different.

* FDTD is a versatile modeling technique used to solve Maxwell's equations. It is intuitive, so users can easily understand how to use it and know what to expect from a given model.
* FDTD is a time-domain technique, and when a broadband pulse (such as a Gaussian pulse) is used as the source, then the response of the system over a wide range of frequencies can be obtained with a single simulation. This is useful in applications where resonant frequencies are not exactly known, or anytime that a broadband result is desired.
* Since FDTD calculates the E and H fields everywhere in the computational domain as they evolve in time, it lends itself to providing animated displays of the electromagnetic field movement through the model. This type of display is useful in understanding what is going on in the model, and to help ensure that the model is working correctly.
* The FDTD technique allows the user to specify the material at all points within the computational domain. A wide variety of linear and nonlinear dielectric and magnetic materials can be naturally and easily modeled.
* FDTD allows the effects of apertures to be determined directly. Shielding effects can be found, and the fields both inside and outside a structure can be found directly or indirectly.
* FDTD uses the E and H fields directly. Since most EMI/EMC modeling applications are interested in the E and H fields, it is convenient that no conversions must be made after the simulation has run to get these values.

=== Weaknesses of FDTD modeling===
* Since FDTD requires that the entire computational domain be gridded, and the grid spatial discretization must be sufficiently fine to resolve both the smallest electromagnetic wavelength and the smallest geometrical feature in the model, very large computational domains can be developed, which results in very long solution times. Models with long, thin features, (like wires) are difficult to model in FDTD because of the excessively large computational domain required. Methods such as [[Eigenmode Expansion]] can offer a more efficient alternative as they do not require a fine grid along the z-direction.&lt;ref name="phot_cad" /&gt;
* There is no way to determine unique values for permittivity and permeability at a material interface.
* Space and time steps must satisfy the [[Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition|CFL condition]], or the [[leapfrog integration]] used to solve the partial differential equation is likely to become unstable.
* FDTD finds the E/H fields directly everywhere in the computational domain. If the field values at some distance are desired, it is likely that this distance will force the computational domain to be excessively large. Far-field extensions are available for FDTD, but require some amount of postprocessing.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;
* Since FDTD simulations calculate the E and H fields at all points within the computational domain, the computational domain must be finite to permit its residence in the computer memory. In many cases this is achieved by inserting artificial boundaries into the simulation space. Care must be taken to minimize errors introduced by such boundaries. There are a number of available highly effective absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) to simulate an infinite unbounded computational domain.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;  Most modern FDTD implementations instead use a special absorbing "material", called a [[perfectly matched layer]] (PML) to implement absorbing boundaries.&lt;ref name="berenger94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gedney96" /&gt;
* Because FDTD is solved by propagating the fields forward in the time domain, the electromagnetic time response of the medium must be modeled explicitly.  For an arbitrary response, this involves a computationally expensive time convolution, although in most cases the time response of the medium (or [[Dispersion (optics)]]) can be adequately and simply modeled using either the recursive convolution (RC) technique, the auxiliary differential equation (ADE) technique, or the Z-transform technique. An alternative way of solving [[Maxwell's equations]] that can treat arbitrary dispersion easily is the [[Computational electrodynamics#Pseudo-spectral spatial domain .28PSSD.29|Pseudospectral Spatial-Domain method
(PSSD)]], which instead propagates the fields forward in space.

===Grid truncation techniques===
The most commonly used grid truncation techniques for open-region FDTD modeling problems are the Mur absorbing boundary condition (ABC),&lt;ref name="mur81" /&gt; the Liao ABC,&lt;ref name="liao84" /&gt; and various [[perfectly matched layer]] (PML) formulations.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="berenger94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gedney96" /&gt; The Mur and Liao techniques are simpler than PML. However, PML (which is technically an absorbing region rather than a boundary condition ''per se'') can provide orders-of-magnitude lower reflections. The PML concept was introduced by J.-P. Berenger in a seminal 1994 paper in the Journal of Computational Physics.&lt;ref name="berenger94" /&gt;  Since 1994, Berenger's original split-field implementation has been modified and extended to the uniaxial PML (UPML), the convolutional PML (CPML), and the higher-order PML. The latter two PML formulations have increased ability to absorb evanescent waves, and therefore can in principle be placed closer to a simulated scattering or radiating structure than Berenger's original formulation.

To reduce undesired numerical reflection from the PML additional back absorbing layers technique can be used.&lt;ref name="back_pml" /&gt;

Notwithstanding both the general increase in academic publication
throughput during the same period and the overall expansion of interest
in all Computational electromagnetics (CEM)  techniques, there are
seven primary reasons for the tremendous expansion of interest in FDTD
computational solution approaches for Maxwell’s equations:

# FDTD uses no linear algebra.  Being a fully explicit computation, FDTD avoids the difficulties with linear algebra that limit the size of frequency-domain integral-equation and finite-element electromagnetics models to generally fewer than 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; electromagnetic field unknowns.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt; FDTD models with as many as 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; field unknowns have been run; there is no intrinsic upper bound to this number.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;
# FDTD is accurate and robust.  The sources of error in FDTD calculations are well understood, and can be bounded to permit accurate models for a very large variety of electromagnetic wave interaction problems.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;
# FDTD treats impulsive behavior naturally.  Being a time-domain technique, FDTD directly calculates the impulse response of an electromagnetic system.  Therefore, a single FDTD simulation can provide either ultrawideband temporal waveforms or the sinusoidal steady-state response at any frequency within the excitation spectrum.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;
# FDTD treats nonlinear behavior naturally.  Being a time-domain technique, FDTD directly calculates the nonlinear response of an electromagnetic system.  This allows natural hybriding of FDTD with sets of auxiliary differential equations that describe nonlinearities from either the classical or semi-classical standpoint.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;  One research frontier is the development of hybrid algorithms which join FDTD classical electrodynamics models with phenomena arising from quantum electrodynamics, especially vacuum fluctuations, such as the [[Casimir effect]].&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. G. Johnson, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1007.0966 Numerical methods for computing Casimir interactions]," in Casimir Physics (D. Dalvit, [[P. Milonni]], D. Roberts, and F. da Rosa, eds.), vol. 834 of ''Lecture Notes in Physics'', ch. 6, pp. 175–218, Berlin: Springer, June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
# FDTD is a systematic approach. With FDTD, specifying a new structure to be modeled is reduced to a problem of mesh generation rather than the potentially complex reformulation of an integral equation.  For example, FDTD requires no calculation of structure-dependent Green functions.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;
# Parallel-processing computer architectures have come to dominate supercomputing.  FDTD scales with high efficiency on parallel-processing CPU-based computers, and extremely well on recently developed GPU-based accelerator technology.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;
# Computer visualization capabilities are increasing rapidly. While this trend positively influences all numerical techniques, it is of particular advantage to FDTD methods, which generate time-marched arrays of field quantities suitable for use in color videos to illustrate the field dynamics.&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;
 
Taflove has argued that these factors combine to suggest that FDTD will remain one of
the dominant computational electrodynamics techniques (as well as potentially other multiphysics problems).&lt;ref name="taflove05" /&gt;

=== Implementations ===
There are hundreds of simulation tools that implement FDTD algorithms, many optimized to run on parallel-processing clusters.

Frederick Moxley suggests further applications with computational quantum mechanics and simulations.&lt;ref name="Moxleylecture" /&gt;

'''Global intellectual history''' is the history of thought in the world across the span of human history, from the [[invention of writing]] to the present. For information about the methodology of [[intellectual history]], please see the [[intellectual history|relevant article]].

In recent years, historians such as [[Christopher Bayly|C. A. Bayly]] have been calling for a ''global intellectual history'' to be written. They stress that to understand the history of ideas across time and space, it is necessary to study from a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] or global point of view the connections and the parallels in intellectual development across the world. Yet these separate histories and their convergence in the modern period have yet to be brought together into a single historical narrative. Nonetheless, some global histories, like Bayly's own ''Birth of the Modern World'' or [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]]'s ''The Declaration of Independence: A Global History'' offer contributions to the huge and necessarily collaborative project of writing the history of thought in a comparative and especially connective way. Other examples of transnational intellectual histories include [[Albert Hourani]]'s ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age''.

The origins of human intellectual history arguably began before the [[invention of writing]], but historians are by definition only concerned with the eras in which writing was present. In the spirit of a historiographic project that is relevant to all human beings and that has yet to be completed, the sections that follow briefly review currents of thought in pre-modern and modern history of the world, and are organized by geographic area (and within each section, chronologically).

==Europe and the Americas==
The modern intellectual history of Europe cannot be separated from various bodies of ancient thought, from the works of classical Greek and Latin authors to the writings of the fathers of the Christian Church. Such a broad survey of topics is not attempted here, however. A debatable but defensible starting point for modern European thought might instead be identified with the birth of [[scholasticism]] and [[humanism]] in the 13th and 14th centuries. Both of these intellectual currents were associated with classical revivals (in the case of scholasticism, the rediscovery of [[Aristotle]]; in the case of humanism, of Latin antiquity, especially [[Cicero]]) and with prominent founders, [[Aquinas]] and [[Petrarch]] respectively. But they were both significantly original intellectual experiences, as well as self-consciously modern, so that they make an appropriate starting point for this survey.

What follows below is a selective and far from complete listing of significant trends and individuals in the history of European thought. While movements such as the Enlightenment or Romanticism are relatively imprecise approximations, rarely taken too seriously by scholars, they are good starting points for approaching the enormous complexity of the history of Europe's intellectual heritage. It is hoped that interested readers will pursue the listed topics in greater depth by consulting the respective articles and the suggestions for further reading.

The intellectual history of western [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]] includes:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
*[[Scholasticism]]: Associated especially with [[Aquinas]] and the [[recovery of Aristotle]], a movement that was popular in universities and provided a new way of reasoning especially in law, philosophy, theology.
*[[Humanism]]: Humanists were associated with the discipline of [[rhetoric]] but they were not just orators, they also learned ancient languages, especially [[classical Greek]] and created new knowledge about the secular past. The revival of ancient literature and philosophy was of immense importance for the further development of European thought. The first humanist is considered to be [[Petrarch]]. Later exponents of note were [[Leonardo Bruni]], [[Lorenzo Valla]], and [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]].
*[[The Renaissance]]: A movement in the arts and letters, it is associated particularly with humanism, but also with new trends in painting and with the efflorescence of a new courtly culture that from [[Italy]] (c.1350) spread across Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries.
*[[Scientific Revolution|The New Philosophy]]: The 20th century dubbed this the [[Scientific Revolution]], but in the 17th century, the new science was more often considered to be a new way of doing philosophy. It is associated mainly with the thought of [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Descartes]]. Other important philosophers were: [[Hobbes]], [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Advances in [[astronomy]] were made by [[Copernicus]], [[Tycho Brahe|Brahe]], [[Kepler]] and [[Galileo]].
*[[The Royal Society]]: A secular creation of an intellectual world led by figures such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[Christopher Wren]], [[Joseph Addison]], and [[Bishop Sprat]].
*[[The Enlightenment]]: Key developments in thought included [[Human rights|The rights of man]], [[representative democracy|political representation]], [[political economy]], [[deism]]. Notable participants counted [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]], [[David|Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]], the [[Comte de Buffon]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Voltaire]], [[Rousseau]], [[Diderot]], [[Moses Mendelssohn]], [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]].
*[[The Encyclopaedists]]: The creation of central repositories of knowledge available to all outside of academies, including mass-market encyclopaedias and dictionaries: [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Ephraim Chambers]].
*[[Romanticism]] : Individual, subjective, imaginative, personal, visionary (scholarly sources [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Sidney Hook|Hook]], and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]).
*[[Post-romanticism]]: Reaction to [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], opposes external-only observations by adding internal observations (scholarly sources [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], [[Leopold von Ranke|von Ranke]]).
*[[Modernism]] : Rejects Christian academic scholarly tradition (scholarly sources [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jacob Burckhardt]], [[Charles A. Beard|Charles Beard]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]]).
*[[Pragmatism]] : Links the meaning of beliefs to the actions of a believer, and the truth of beliefs to success of those actions in securing a believer's goals. [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], [[F.C.S. Schiller]], [[Richard Rorty]]. Originated in late nineteenth century America.
*[[Existentialism]]: Pre- and post-WW2 rejection of Western norms and cultural values.  [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Hans Jonas]], [[Karl Löwith]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Edmund Husserl]]. Engaged with the intellectual prominence of fascism and socialism in Europe during in the 1930s and 1940s, which they saw needed both repudiation and study, as a way to re-establish the individual against the values of a hostile and destructive series of communities creating alienation, isolation, and individual meaninglessness.
*[[Postmodernism]] : Rejects Modernism, [[meta-narrative]] - multiple perspective, role of individual (scholarly sources [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], [[Clifford Geertz|Geertz]]).
*[[Structuralism]] : Many phenomena do not occur in isolation but in relation to each other (scholarly sources [[Clifford Geertz|Geertz]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]).
*[[Poststructuralism]] :[[Deconstruction]], destabilizes the relationship between language and objects the language refers to (scholarly sources [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]], [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]).

==South and East Asia==
''Pre-Modern East Asia''

The intellectual history of China is connected to the birth of scholarship in ancient China, the creation of [[Confucianism]] with its extensive exegesis of the texts of [[Confucius]], and the active part of scholars in governments. In Korea, the [[yangban]] scholar movement drove the development of [[Traditional Korean thought|Korean intellectual history]] from the late [[Goryeo]] to the golden age of intellectual achievement in the [[Joseon Dynasty]].

In [[China]], ''literati'' referred to the government officials who formed the ruling class in China for over two thousand years. These ''[[scholar-bureaucrats]]'' were a [[status group]] of educated [[laymen]], not ordained [[priest]]s. They were not a [[hereditary]] group as their position depended on their knowledge of writing and literature. After 200 B.C. the system of selection of candidates was influenced by [[Confucianism]] and established its ethic among the literati.

Confucianism (儒家, literally "scholarly tradition") is a Chinese ethical and philosophical system originally developed from the teachings of the early Chinese sage Confucius. Confucius is seen as the founder of the teachings of Confucianism, although he claimed to follow the ways of people before him. Confucianism is a complex system of moral, social, political, philosophical, and religious thought which has had tremendous influence on the culture and history of East Asia. Some people in Europe have considered it to have been the "state religion" in East Asian countries because of governmental promotion of Confucianist values and needs.

Other ancient intellectual currents in East Asia include [[Buddhism]] and [[Daoism]].

''Modern East Asia''

The modern intellectual history of [[China]] is considered to begin with the arrival of the [[Jesuits]] in the sixteenth century. The Jesuits brought with them new astronomical and cartographic knowledge, and were responsible for new developments in [[Chinese science]]. Science in modern China has been the subject of the work of the historian [[Benjamin Elman]].

''Pre-Modern South Asia''

Indian thought is a broad topic that includes the ancient epics of South Asia, the development of what is now called [[Hinduism]] and [[Hindu philosophy]] and the rise of [[Buddhism]], as well as many other topics relating to the political and artistic lives of pre-modern South Asia.

[[Ram Sharan Sharma]]'s work ''Aspects of Political Ideas and Institutions in India'' ([[Motilal Banarsidass]] is the most authoritative account of ancient Indian political ideas and institutions. It deals with the intellectual standards in ancient India in terms of political institutions.

==Africa and the Middle East==
''Pre-Modern History''

The culture of the ancient [[Near East]] and eventually of much of Africa as well was modified significantly by the arrival of [[Islam]] beginning in the seventh century CE. The history of [[Islam]] has been the work of many scholars, both Muslim and non-Muslim, and including such luminaries as [[Ignác Goldziher]], [[Marshall Hodgson]] and in more recent times [[Patricia Crone]]. Islamic culture is not a simple and unified entity. The history of Islam, like that of other religions, is a history of different interpretations and approaches to Islam. There is no a-historical Islam outside the process of historical development.

[[Islamic thought]] includes a variety of different intellectual disciplines, including theology, the study of the [[Qur'an]], the study of [[Hadith]], [[history]], [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]]. For more information see the [[Islamic Golden Age]].

Classical Islamic scholars and authors include:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
*[[Ali al-Masudi]]
*[[Ibn Khaldūn]]
*[[Al-Ma'arri]]
*[[Taftazani]]
*[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]
*[[Ibn Sina]]
*[[Ibn Rushd]]
*[[Ibn Arabi]]
*[[Ibn Hisham]]
*[[al-Tabari]]
{{div col end}}

[[Persian philosophy]] can be traced back as far as to Old Iranian philosophical traditions and  thoughts which originated in ancient [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] roots and were considerably influenced by  [[Zarathustra]]'s teachings. Throughout Iranian history and due to remarkable political and social changes such as the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian]], [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab]] and [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol]] invasions of Persia a wide spectrum of schools of thoughts showed a variety of views on philosophical questions extending from Old Iranian and mainly [[Zoroastrianism]]-related traditions to schools appearing in the late pre-Islamic era such as [[Manicheism]] and [[Mazdakism]] as well as various post-Islamic schools. Iranian philosophy after Arab invasion of [[Persia]], is characterized by different interactions with the [[Ancient philosophy|Old Iranian philosophy]], the [[Greek philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. The [[Illumination School]] and the [[Transcendent Philosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia.

''Modern Near and Middle East''

[[Islam and modernity]] encompass the relation and compatibility between the phenomenon of modernity, its related concepts and ideas, and the religion of Islam. In order to understand the relation between Islam and modernity, one point should be made in the beginning. Similarly, modernity is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon rather than a unified and coherent phenomenon. It has historically had different schools of thoughts moving in many directions.

[[Intellectual movements in Iran]] involve the Iranian experience of [[modernism]], through which Iranian modernity and its associated art, science, literature, poetry, and political structures have been evolving since the 19th century. [[Religious intellectualism in Iran]] develops gradually and subtly. It reached its apogee during the Persian Constitutional Revolution (1906–11). The process involved numerous philosophers, sociologists, political scientists and cultural theorists. However the associated art, cinema and poetry remained to be developed.

''Modern Africa''

Recent concepts about African culture include the [[African Renaissance]] and [[Afrocentrism]]. The [[African Renaissance]] is a concept popularized by [[President of South Africa|South African President]] [[Thabo Mbeki]] who called upon the African people and nations to solve the many problems troubling the [[Africa]]n continent.  It reached its height in the late 1990s but continues to be a key part of the post-[[apartheid]] intellectual agenda in South Africa. The concept however extends well beyond intellectual life to politics and economic development.

With the rise of [[Afrocentrism]], the push away from [[Eurocentrism]] has led to the focus on the contributions of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]] and their model of world civilization and [[history]]. Afrocentrism aims to shift the focus from a perceived European-centered history to an [[Africa]]n-centered history. More broadly, Afrocentrism is concerned with distinguishing the influence of [[Demography of Europe|European]] and [[Oriental]] peoples from African achievements.

Notable modern African intellectual include:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
*[[Taban Lo Liyong]]
*[[Wole Soyinka]]
*[[Frantz Fanon]]
*[[Chinua Achebe]]
*[[Yusuf Bala Usman]]
*[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] spent his final years in Ghana

&lt;!--- =Draft: Guidances for statistics in regulatory affairs= ---&gt;
'''Guidances for statistics in regulatory affairs''' are applicable to the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and medical devices industry. These Guidances represent the current thinking of regulatory agencies on a particular subject. It is to be noted that the term “Guidances” is used in the USA, whereas the term “Guidelines” is used in Europe.

Regulatory affairs, also called government affairs, is a profession within regulated industries, such as pharmaceutical and medical devices, where professionals such as statisticians are expected to implement regulatory guidance into their work practices.

Statisticians working in a regulated environment (e.g. the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry) are obliged to have a sound knowledge and understanding of the regulatory requirements that affect the design, conduct, analysis and reporting of their studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gerlinger, C., Edler, L., Friede, T., Kieser, M., Nakas, C.T., Schumacher, M., Seldrup, J. and Victor, N.| title=Considerations on what constitutes a "Qualified Statistician" in regulatory guidelines.| journal=Statistics in Medicine | date=2012 | volume=31 | pages=1303–1305 | pmid= | last2= | first2= | issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulatory guidance for the pharmaceutical and medical devices industry can be found at the international level (e.g. ICH - [[International Council on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]]), as well as at the regional/national level; for example:
* EMA - [[European Medicines Agency]] in Europe, 
* MHRA - [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] in UK, 
* IQWiG - [[Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care]] in Germany, 
* FDA - [[Food and Drug Administration]] in USA and 
* PMDA - [[Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency]] in Japan.

Furthermore, statistical regulatory guidance is found under general topics (e.g. [[Good Clinical Practice]] - ICH E6(R2)&lt;ref name="ICH E6"&gt;[http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6/E6_R2__Step_4_2016_1109.pdf ICH E6(R2) - Good clinical practice (GCP)]&lt;/ref&gt;) and specific ones explicitly related to statistics (e.g. Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials - ICH E9 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E9/Step4/E9_Guideline.pdf ICH E9 - Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials]&lt;/ref&gt;) or not explicitly (e.g. Special Populations: Geriatrics [ICH E7] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E9/Step4/E9_Guideline.pdf ICH E7 - Studies in support of special populations: geriatrics]&lt;/ref&gt; or Clinical Trial Endpoints in Oncology [FDA]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/ucm071590.pdf FDA - Clinical trial endpoints for the approval of cancer drugs and biologics]&lt;/ref&gt;). This large volume and diversity of regulatory guidances (draft and/or final ) is subject to revisions. Therefore, users of the guidances are advised to consult the original website to check for the latest version. Users are also encouraged to update the Wikipedia content

The Wikipedia [[List of Guidances for Statistics in Regulatory Affairs]] provides links to various guidances under different topics.

== History ==
Regulation in the USA started in 1906 with the [[Food and Drugs Act]] and further USA regulation came in 1938 with the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] following the deaths due to [[Elixir sulfanilamide]] in 1937. Further tragedies resulted from the use of [[Thalidomide]] that was marketed in 1957, Germany, without adequate testing.&lt;ref name="The chemical industry"&gt;{{cite book | last = Heaton | first = C. A. | title = The Chemical Industry | publisher = Springer | year = 1994 | page = 40 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thalidomide catastrophe tightened the regulatory pressure in the US with the [[Kefauver Harris Amendment]] (1962) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act  and the European regulation appeared with UK's "[[Medicines Act 1968]]". Further developments lead to a large volume and variety of regulatory “guidances” by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in the USA and “guidelines” by the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) in Europe. Also, other regions of the world issued regulatory guidance, for example, [[Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency]]  (PMDA) in Japan. In 1989 a plan for harmonization of guidance across Europe, Japan and the USA was started and the first meeting of [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] (ICH) was held in 1990, Brussels.

Regarding applications in [[Health technology assessment]] (HTA) a number of national guidance papers are available from the local  HTA organizations: the [[Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care]] (IQWiG) in Germany, the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) in UK, the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) in USA or the [[Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health]] (CADTH) in Canada. In Europe, the [[European Network for Health Technology Assessment]]  (EUnetHTA) was established in 2005 to create an effective and sustainable network for HTA to support collaboration between European HTA organizations. EUnetHTA Guidelines have been developed to help the assessors of evidence to process, analyse and interpret the data.

== General Guidance ==
General guidance covers statistical topics that relate to good clinical practice; study design, monitoring and reporting, and market authorization of medical products or medical devices.

=== Good Clinical Practice === 
The [[good clinical practice]] (GCP) &lt;ref name="ICH E6"/&gt; is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording and reporting trials that involve the participation of human subjects. It was issued by ICH under [[Good Clinical Practice Directive]] (Directive 2005/28/EC) of 8 April 2005. A similar guideline for clinical trials of [[medical devices]] is the international standard [[ISO 14155]], that is valid in the European Union as a harmonized standard.
Compliance with the GCP standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial data are credible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="89810">The '''Hungarian Automated Telescope Network''' ('''HATNet''') project is a network of six small fully automated "HAT" telescopes. The scientific goal of the project is to detect and characterize [[extrasolar planets]] using the [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Transit method|transit method]]. This network is used also to find and follow bright [[variable star]]s. The network is maintained by the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]].

The HAT acronym stands for ''Hungarian-made Automated Telescope'', because it was developed by a small group of Hungarians who met through the Hungarian Astronomical Association. The project started in 1999 and has been fully operational since May 2001.&lt;ref name="Bakos2002"/&gt;

==Equipment==
The prototype instrument, HAT-1 was built from a 180&amp;nbsp;mm focal length and 65&amp;nbsp;mm aperture [[Nikon]] [[telephoto lens]] and a [[Kodak]] KAF-0401E chip of 512 × 768, 9&amp;nbsp;μm [[pixels]]. The test period was from 2000 to 2001 at the  [[Konkoly Observatory]] in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name="Bakos2002"/&gt;

HAT-1 was transported from Budapest to the [[Steward Observatory]], [[Kitt Peak]], [[Arizona]], USA, in January 2001. The transportation caused serious damage to the equipment.&lt;ref name="Bakos2002"/&gt;

Later built telescopes use [[Canon (company)|Canon]] 11&amp;nbsp;cm diameter f/1.8L lenses for a wide-field of 8°×8°. It is a fully automated instrument with 2K x 2K [[Charge-coupled device]] (CCD) sensors. One HAT instrument operates at the [[Wise Observatory]].&lt;ref name=improv&gt;{{cite journal

HAT is controlled by a single [[Linux]] [[personal computer|PC]] without human supervision. Data are stored in a [[MySQL]] database.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===HAT-South===
From 2009, three other locations joined the HATNet with telescopes of completely new design. The telescopes are deployed to [[Australia]], [[Namibia]] and [[Chile]]. Each system has eight (2*4) joint-mounted, quasi-parallel [[Takahashi Seisakusho|Takahashi]] Epsilon (180&amp;nbsp;mm diameter, f/2.8) [[astrograph]]s with Apogee 4k*4k [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]] with overlapping fields of view. The processing computers are [[Xenomai]]-based industrial PCs with 10 TB of storage. The funding is provided until 2013.

==Participants in the project==
HAT-1 was developed during the undergraduate (and also the first year graduate) studies of Gáspár Bakos ([[Eötvös Loránd University]]) and at [[Konkoly Observatory]] (Budapest), under the supervision of  Dr. Géza Kovács. In the development József Lázár, István Papp and Pál Sári also played an important role.

==Planets discovered==
Twenty-nine [[extrasolar planets]] have been discovered so far by the HATNet project (note that the discovery of the planet [[WASP-11b/HAT-P-10b]], [[WASP-40b/HAT-P-27b]] and [[WASP-51b/HAT-P-30b]] was simultaneously announced by the [[SuperWASP]] team). All have been discovered using the [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Transit method|transit method]]. In addition, the radial velocity followup has detected an additional companion, either a massive planet or a small [[brown dwarf]] around the star HAT-P-13, making this the first known transiting planet in a system with an outer companion in a well-characterised orbit.&lt;ref name="Bakos2009b"/&gt;

''Light green rows indicate that the planet orbits one of the stars in a binary star system.''

 {{main|Harold Adams Innis}}
'''[[Harold Innis|Harold Adams Innis]]''' (November 5, 1894 – November 8, 1952) was a professor of [[political economy]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and the author of seminal works on Canadian economic history and on media and [[communication theory]]. He helped develop the [[staples thesis]], which holds that Canada's culture, political history and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of staples such as fur, fish, wood, wheat, mined metals and fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook, W.T. and Watkins, M.H. (1984) "The Staple Approach." In ''Approaches to Canadian Economic History.'' Ottawa: Carleton Library Series, Carleton University Press, pp. 1–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis's communications writings explore the role of media in shaping the culture and development of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, Robert E. (2000) "The Communication Thought of Harold Adams Innis." In ''Canadian Communication Thought: Ten Foundational Writers''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 51–88.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued, for example, that a balance between oral and written forms of communication contributed to the flourishing of Greek civilization in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Paul. (2003) ''Harold Innis''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc., p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; But he warned that [[Western culture|Western civilization]] is now imperiled by powerful, advertising-driven media obsessed by "present-mindedness" and the "continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1952) ''Changing Concepts of Time''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communications theories==
===Time and space===

{{quote|Improvements in communication...make for increased difficulties of understanding.|Harold Innis|''The Bias of Communication''&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1951) ''The Bias of Communication''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 28. &lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of Harold Innis's primary contributions to the field of communications was to apply the dimensions of time and space to various media. He divided media into time-biased and space-biased  types. Time-biased media include [[clay tablet|clay]] or [[stele|stone tablet]]s, [[manuscript|hand-copied manuscripts ]] on [[parchment]] or [[vellum]] and oral sources such as [[Homer|Homer's]] epic poems. These are intended to carry stories and messages that last for many generations, but tend to reach limited audiences. Space-biased media are more ephemeral. They include modern media such as radio, television, and mass circulation newspapers that convey information to many people over long distances, but have short exposure times. While time-biased media favour stability, community, tradition and religion, space-biased media facilitate rapid change, materialism, secularism and empire. Innis elaborated on his distinctions between time-biased and space-biased media in ''[[Empire and Communications]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The concepts of time and space reflect the significance of media to civilization. Media that emphasize time are those durable in character such as parchment, clay and stone. The heavy materials are suited to the development of architecture and sculpture. Media that emphasize space are apt to be less durable and light in character such as papyrus and paper. The latter are suited to wide areas in administration and trade. The conquest of Egypt by Rome gave access to supplies of papyrus, which became the basis of a large administrative empire. Materials that emphasize time favour decentralization and hierarchical types of institutions, while those that emphasize space favour centralization and systems of government less hierarchical in character.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1950) ''Empire and Communications''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Fur traders in canada 1777.jpg|right|thumb|The encounter of European traders from a space-bound print culture with aboriginal hunters from a time-bound oral culture. Innovation meets tradition with disastrous, long-term results.]]

Societies that depend solely on time-biased media are oral and tribal. Although leadership tends to be hierarchical, time-bound societies may also operate by consensus. Since, in their purest form, time-bound cultures do not rely on written records, they must preserve their traditions in story, song and myth handed down unchanged from one generation to the next. For them memory is of crucial importance; they revere the wisdom of elders and favour concrete over abstract forms of thought. On the other hand, societies that depend on space-biased media such as printed newspapers and books tend to favour abstract thought and control over space. They have little regard for tradition and when compared with oral societies, their ways of thinking are apt to be  more rational, linear and impersonal.&lt;ref&gt;See Babe, pp.72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The encounter of European traders from the imperial centres of France and Britain with the aboriginal tribes of North America that Innis chronicled in ''The Fur Trade in Canada'' is a poignant example of what can happen when two different civilizations meet --- one traditional and oriented to preserving its tribal culture in time and the other bent on spreading its influence over long distances. European guns used in war and conquest, for example, enabled the indigenous peoples to hunt more efficiently, but led to the rapid destruction of their food supply and of the beaver they depended on to obtain European goods. Conflicts over hunting territories led to warfare, made more deadly by European bullets.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Alexander, John. (2006). ''Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.150–153. "The apocalypse of culture disorientation that Innis would come to believe followed the introduction of writing and printing, and still later followed the application of power to print reproduction, has its prototype in the collapse of the traditional Indian civilization after the introduction of iron trade goods."&lt;/ref&gt; And all this, Innis argued, disturbed the balance that "...had grown up previous to the coming of the European."&lt;ref&gt; Innis (Fur Trade) pp.388–389.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balance, bias and empire===

Harold Innis examined the rise and fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain the empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. Innis wrote that the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire: "The sword and pen worked together. Power was increased by concentration in a few hands, specialization of function was enforced, and scribes with leisure to keep and study records contributed to the advancement of knowledge and thought. The written record, signed, sealed and swiftly transmitted was essential to military power and the extension of government."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire and Communications) pp.10–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis warned however, that such generalizations tended to obscure the differences between empires. So, he embarked on specific studies of the civilizations of [[ancient Egypt]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]; as well as of the effects of the oral tradition on [[Ancient Greece|Greek civilization]] and the written tradition on the [[Roman Empire]]. His reflections appear in separate chapters in his book ''Empire and Communications'' along with additional chapters on the combined effects of parchment and paper in the [[Middle Ages]], and paper and the printing press in the development of modern societies.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p.52: Heyer writes that ''Empire and Communications'' received few reviews and they ranged from "lukewarm to negative". Yet, many now see it as a Canadian classic because it "has sufficient detail in its analysis and originality to be regarded as a landmark book."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Plato Symposium papyrus.jpg|thumb|left|A papyrus copy of Plato's [[Symposium (Plato)|''Symposium'']]. Using the flexible Greek alphabet, Plato preserved the power of spoken dialogue in written prose. Innis thought this balancing of time and space-oriented media contributed to the cultural and intellectual vitality of ancient Greece.]]

Biographer John Watson warns against the tendency to apply Innis's concept of media 'bias' in a mechanical or deterministic way. He writes that Innis "emphasizes, in dealing with ''concrete historical cases'', the necessity of a balance of ''various media'' whose predispositions [or biases] complement each other to make for a successful imperial project." Watson points out that for Innis, balance was crucial in sustaining an empire. Innis examined each empire to discover how time-binding and space-binding media contributed to the necessary balance between power and knowledge and among ruling groups – religious, political and military.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.312–319.&lt;/ref&gt; As Innis himself wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Concentration on a medium of communication implies a bias in the cultural development of the civilization concerned either towards an emphasis on space and political organization or towards an emphasis on time and religious organization. Introduction of a second medium tends to check the bias of the first and to create conditions suited to the growth of empire. The [[Byzantine empire]] emerged from a fusion of a bias incidental to [[papyrus]] in relation to political organization and of [[parchment]] in relation to ecclesiastical organization.&lt;ref&gt; Innis, (''Empire and Communications''). p.216.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Innis argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of ancient Greece in the time of [[Plato]]. Plato conveyed his ideas by recording the conversations of [[Socrates]]. His philosophy thus preserved "the power of the spoken word on the written page." Plato's method of using poetic dialogues cast in prose enabled him to arrive at new philosophical positions.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, pp.68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; This balance between the time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of writing was eventually upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing. The torch of empire then passed from Greece to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, pp.99–100. See also, Heyer, pp.49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monopolies of knowledge===

In his 1947 presidential address to the [[Royal Society of Canada]], Innis remarked: "I have attempted to suggest that Western civilization has been profoundly influenced by communication and that marked changes in communications have had important implications." He went on to mention the evolution of communications media from the [[cuneiform]] script inscribed on clay tablets in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] to the advent of radio in the 20th century. "In each period I have attempted to trace the implications of the media of communication for the character of knowledge and to suggest that a monopoly or oligopoly of knowledge is built up to the point that equilibrium is disturbed."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1951) ''The Bias of Communication.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis argued, for example, that a "complex system of writing" such as cuneiform script resulted in the growth of a "special class" of scribes.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Bias) p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The long training required to master such writing ensured that relatively few people would belong to this privileged and aristocratic class. As Paul Heyer explains:
[[Image:SphinxGiza.jpg|thumb|right|The Sphinx and the Great Pyramid at Giza. Innis wrote that the monarchs who built the pyramids had to relinquish their absolute power when papyrus replaced stone as the dominant medium of communication.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the beginning, which for Innis means Mesopotamia, there was clay, the reed stylus used to write on it, and the wedge-shaped cuneiform script. Thus did civilization arise, along with an elite group of scribe priests who eventually codified laws. Egypt followed suit, using papyrus, the brush, and hieroglyphic writing.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In ''[[Empire and Communications]]'', Innis wrote that the ebb and flow of Egypt's ancient empire partly reflected weaknesses or limitations imposed by "the inflexibility of religious institutions supported by a monopoly over a complex system of writing":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Writing was a difficult and specialized art requiring long apprenticeship, and reading implied a long period of instruction. The god of writing was closely related to the leading deities and reflected the power of the scribe over religion. The scribe had the full qualifications of a special profession and was included in the upper classes of kings, priests, nobles and generals, in contrast with peasants, fishermen, artisans and labourers. Complexity favoured increasing control under a monopoly of priests and the confinement of knowledge to special classes.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire) p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Innis argued that this priestly or scribal monopoly disturbed the necessary balance between the religious bias toward time and continuity, and the political bias toward space and power. "A successful empire," he wrote, "required adequate appreciation of the problems of space, which were in part military and political, and of problems of time, which were in part dynastic and biological and in part religious." He ended his essay on ancient Egypt by pointing to the imbalance that arose because the priestly monopoly over writing and knowledge supported an emphasis on time and religion, but neglected the political problems inherent in ruling over an empire extended in space.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire) p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Harold Innis, monopolies of knowledge eventually face challenges to their power, especially with the arrival of new media. He pointed for example, to the monasteries that spread throughout Europe after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. Their monopoly of knowledge depended on their control over the production of the time-binding medium of parchment useful for preserving hand-copied manuscripts written in Latin. Power was vested therefore, in a scribal and literate, religious elite. The largely illiterate laity depended on priests to interpret the scriptures and on image-driven media such as paintings and statues that depicted the central figures in Biblical stories.

[[Image:Chaucer_Hoccleve.png|thumb|left|280px|[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (c. 1343 – 1400). Innis pointed out that Chaucer wrote in vernacular English instead of Latin or Norman French hastening the growth of English nationalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Portrait of Chaucer by [[Thomas Hoccleve]].&lt;/sub&gt;]]

But the space-binding medium of paper imported from China, Innis wrote, facilitated challenges from Islam and later from a rising commercial class. "Paper supported the growth of trade and cities and of education beyond the control of the monasteries, and in turn of the Church and the cathedrals."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire) pp.165–166.&lt;/ref&gt; Paper also supported the rise of vernacular languages reducing Latin's cultural sway.

Innis wrote that the Catholic Church fought to preserve its time-oriented monopoly of knowledge with the [[Inquisition]], but eventually paper achieved even greater power with the invention of the [[printing press]] around the middle of the 15th century. Now, the balance shifted decisively in favour of space over time. The [[Protestant Reformation]] followed, along with European exploration and empire, the rise of science and the evolution of the nation-state. Characteristically, Innis summarizes the far-reaching implications of the new medium of paper in a single paragraph that starts with the Middle Ages and ends with the modern United States:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The dominance of parchment in the West gave a bias toward ecclesiastical organization, which led to the introduction of paper, with its bias toward political organization. With printing, paper facilitated an effective development of the vernaculars and gave expression to their vitality in the growth of nationalism. The adaptability of the alphabet to large-scale machine industry became the basis of literacy, advertising and trade. The book as a specialized product of printing and, in turn, the newspaper strengthened the position of language as a basis of nationalism. In the United States, the dominance of the newspaper led to large-scale development of monopolies of communication in terms of space and implied a neglect of problems of time.&lt;ref&gt; Innis, (Empire) p.216. Innis traces the histories of parchment, paper and printing in his book's final chapters, pp. 140–217.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Western civilization in peril===

Harold Innis's analysis of the effects of communications on the rise and fall of empires led him, in the end, to warn grimly that Western civilization was now facing its own profound crisis. The development of "mechanized" communications media such as mass-circulation newspapers had shifted the balance decisively in favour of space and power, over time, continuity and knowledge. Industrial societies cut time into precise fragments suitable to engineers and accountants&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Bias), p.140.&lt;/ref&gt; and Western civilization suffered from an "obsession with present-mindedness" that eliminated concerns about past or future.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.87&lt;/ref&gt; Communications media that transmit information quickly over long distances had upset the balance required for cultural survival. "The overwhelming pressure of mechanization evident in the newspaper and the magazine," Innis wrote, "has led to the creation of vast monopolies of communication. Their entrenched positions involve a continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity. The emphasis on change is the only permanent characteristic."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1952) ''Changing Concepts of Time''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Valiant Shield - B2 Stealth bomber from Missouri leads ariel formation.jpg|thumb|A B-2 Stealth Bomber leads an aerial flight formation during exercise [[Valiant Shield]] in 2006. Innis believed that advanced U.S. military technologies reinforced the American obsession with space, empire and force at the expense of time, tradition and knowledge.]]

The crisis facing the West was worsened, Innis argued, because communications monopolies that ran the media were largely immune from outside challenge. They literally spoke the language of the masses, effectively penetrating popular consciousness and shaping public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.385.&lt;/ref&gt; American media, with their dependence on advertising and therefore mass appeal, were extremely effective at mobilizing large audiences. Not only were Americans exhorted to buy the newest "improved" products, they were also exposed to a barrage of propaganda from political elites. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] mastered the newspaper as a communications device, just as his fifth cousin, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] mastered radio.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias) p.81&lt;/ref&gt; The news media were also influenced by a large [[public relations]] industry that shaped public opinion on behalf of powerful interests.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Changing Concepts), pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis believed that the overwhelming spatial bias of modern media was heightened in the United States by the development of powerful military technologies, including atomic weapons. The advent of the [[Cold War]] led to such an emphasis on military preparedness that the U.S. was placed on a permanent war footing, its economy increasingly dependent on the manufacture of weapons. As Canadian scholar Arthur Kroker writes, "Innis's political lesson was clear: the United States was now a fully 'space-oriented' society, with no inner coordinating principle and with no organic conception of 'lived tradition,' time, succession or duration which might act as an inner check against the politics of imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Kroker, Arthur. (1984). ''Technology and the Canadian Mind: Innis/McLuhan/Grant''. Montreal: New World Perspectives, p.123.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Biographer John Watson writes that "the United States represents to Innis something akin to cultural apocalypse."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.386.&lt;/ref&gt; In an essay entitled, "Technology and Public Opinion in U.S.A," Innis concluded that the United States depended on a foreign policy shaped by military power. "Dependence on organized power and a traditional antipathy to coloured peoples weakens political sensitivity, and lack of experience with problems of continuity and empire threatens the Western world with uncertainty and war."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.189.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis was among the first to suggest that the U.S. had lost the balance between power and knowledge essential to its long-term survival.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.381 and 387.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Western civilization could only be saved, Innis argued, by recovering the balance between space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing institutions of higher learning from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, ''A Plea for Time'', he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias) ''A Plea for Time'', pp.61–91. The comment about universities mustering their courage appears in "The upside of ivory towers" by Rick Salutin. ''Globe and Mail'', Sept. 7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of Innis's theories==

Influenced by Innis's communications theories, historian [[Marshall Poe]] proposed a theory on the genesis of new media. He proposed that new media are "pulled" into existence by organized interests after inventors have already developed the technology, or prototypes of the technology, necessary to support the media.  Poe's theory also predicts the effects the media will have on society by considering eight attributes of a medium: accessibility, privacy, fidelity, volume, velocity, range, persistence, and searchability.&lt;ref name="Poe, A History of Communications"&gt;{{cite book|last=Poe|first=Marshall|title=A History of Communication: Media and Society from the Evolution of Speech to the Internet|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-17944-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marshall McLuhan]], Canadian philosopher, [[public intellectual]] and former colleague of Innis at the [[University of Toronto]], also acknowledged Innis's impact on McLuhan's own works, including "The Gutenberg Galaxy", and "Understanding Media".{{cn|date=March 2018}}

'''Historical behaviour studies (Historische Verhaltensforschung)''' is a field of research in cultural history and cultural anthropology and a particular methodological approach to the study of human behaviour.

== Method and object of research ==

Historical behaviour studies are a type of [[cultural sociology]] under the particular aspect of historical change. Its focal points were:

* to describe [[patterns]] of human bodily practice as [[rites]] and ceremonies, music and dance, sports and exercises, play and game, beyond ideas and [[weltanschauung]] [[:de:Weltanschauung]];
* to identify analogies between [[patterns]] of bodily [[behaviour]], ([[gestures]] and body movement) and patterns of [[thinking]] (“Denkordnungen”);
* to compare forms of behaviour across different times and [[cultures]] by [[patterns]] and [[wikt:configuration|configurations]] rather than by meaning;
* to compare patterns of behaviour, of thinking and of mentalities (mindsets) in different fields of society, as in economic behaviour, military behaviour, concepts of [[natural sciences]], proceedings and atmospheres in literary works, and [[social movements]];
* to understand epochal changes of behaviour (→[[Periodization]]);
* to bridge the gap between history, [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]].

== Institute of Social Research – the Stuttgart school ==

The Historical Behaviour Studies (Historische Verhaltensforschung) were established in 1971 by August Nitschke [[:de:August Nitschke]] and [[Henning Eichberg]] as a department of the [[University of Stuttgart]]. The Department of Historical Behaviour Studies was part of the newly established Institute of Social Research, side by side with departments of [[social planning]] and [[social economy]]. Later on, historians like Johannes Burkhardt [[:de:Johannes Burkhardt]], [[Andreas Kalckhoff]], Harald Kleinschmidt, Volker Saftien and Michael Walter joined the department. Others like Wolfgang Christian Schneider, Andreas Gestrich [[:de:Andreas Gestrich]], Mathias Beer und Katja Erdmann-Rajski worked in connection with the department and used similar methods of research.

The research of this Stuttgart school of studies in [[human behaviour]] was to a certain extent parallel to the [[History of Mentalities]] from France, to the Cultural Sociology (Kultursoziologie [[:de:Kultursoziologie]]) from Germany and Denmark, and to the [[Historical Anthropology]] or ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' from Germany which arose in the 1990s. Referring to [[Ruth Benedict]], [[Norbert Elias]] and [[Michel Foucault]], the patterns of human behaviour were called “[[wikt:configuration|configurations]]” (→[[Configurational analysis (Konfigurationsanalyse)]]).

== Analyzing historical change and cultural difference ==

The Stuttgart school of Historical Behaviour Studies directed special attention towards fundamental and abrupt changes of behavior and society, as they could be observed in the context of the [[Renaissance]] 1550–1650, of the [[Industrial Revolution]] around 1770–1820, and in cultural change around 1900–1930. Other changes were studied for the [[Middle Ages]]. These historical [[case studies]] could lead to questions concerning the significance and change of behaviour at present and in the future.

A particular characteristic of the Stuttgart studies of historical behaviour was the comparative turn towards non-Western societies like [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], and [[China]].

While the Stuttgart school generally focused on “describing” (→[[description]]) and “[[understanding]]” different forms and changes of historical behaviour, the “[[explanation]]” of [[cultural difference]] and change was discussed diversely. Eichberg emphasized the irreducible [[Other (philosophy)|other]]ness ([[alterity]]) of foreign behavior; “extraneous” patterns withdraw from the explanations of the external observer and develop, also in modernity, on ways quite different from Western standard. Nitschke [[:de:August Nitschke]] tried to find explanations for the historical dynamics of different [[cultures]] by models of [[energy]] and [[time]] expectation; this met with observations of [[self-organization]] (→[[Synergetics (Haken)]]) as reported in [[physics]] and [[biology]]. Common for the Stuttgart school was a skeptical distance towards the traditional explanation of historical change by [[ideologies]], individual [[intention]]s, general [[social structures]] or one global process of [[sociocultural evolution]].

== Influence on international research ==

The Historical Behaviour Studies contributed among others to the history of [[popular culture]], and of [[peace]] and [[war]], to the study of [[paradigm]] changes in [[natural sciences]], to the [[history of art]] and of the [[public sphere]]. They had a special impact on the international study of body culture ([[physical culture]]). The Danish school of body culture studies developed the analysis of [[wikt:configuration|configurations]] – social space, social time, inter-human relations, atmospheres and emotions, and the objectifying of [[:wikt:movement|movement]] – towards the study of [[sport]] and other movement cultures (p. e. [[musical gesture]]) in diverse societies and social formations.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2013}}
'''Industrial wastewater treatment''' describes the processes used for [[Wastewater treatment|treating wastewater]] that is produced by industries as an undesirable by-product. After treatment, the treated industrial wastewater (or effluent) may be reused or released to a [[sanitary sewer]] or to a [[surface water]] in the environment. 

Most industries produce some [[wastewater]]. Recent trends have been to minimize such production or to recycle treated wastewater within the production process.

== Sources of industrial wastewater ==

===Battery manufacturing===
Battery manufacturers specialize in fabricating small devices for electronics and portable equipment (e.g., power tools), or larger, high-powered units for cars, trucks and other motorized vehicles. Pollutants generated at manufacturing plants includes cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, cyanide, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, oil &amp; grease, silver and zinc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/battery-manufacturing-effluent-guidelines |title=Battery Manufacturing Effluent Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-06-12 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organic chemicals manufacturing===
The specific pollutants discharged by organic chemical manufacturers vary widely from plant to plant, depending on the types of products manufactured, such as bulk organic chemicals, resins, pesticides, plastics, or synthetic fibers. Some of the organic compounds that may be discharged are [[benzene]], [[chloroform]], [[napthalene]], [[phenol]]s, [[toluene]] and [[vinyl chloride]]. [[Biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD), which is a gross measurement of a range of organic pollutants, may be used to gauge the effectiveness of a biological wastewater treatment system, and is used as a regulatory parameter in some discharge permits. Metal pollutant discharges may include [[chromium]], [[copper]], [[lead]], [[nickel]] and [[zinc]].&lt;ref name="EPA-OCPSF"&gt;{{cite report |date=October 1987 |title=Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines, New Source Performance Standards and Pretreatment Standards for the Organic Chemicals, Plastics And Synthetic Fibers Point Source Category; Volume I |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/organic-chemicals-effluent-guidelines-documents |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 440/1-87/009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric power plants===
[[Fossil-fuel power station]]s, particularly [[coal]]-fired plants, are a major source of industrial wastewater. Many of these plants discharge wastewater with significant levels of metals such as [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[cadmium]] and [[chromium]], as well as [[arsenic]], [[selenium]] and [[nitrogen]] compounds ([[nitrate]]s and [[nitrite]]s). Wastewater streams include [[flue-gas desulfurization]], [[fly ash]], [[bottom ash]] and [[flue gas]] mercury control. Plants with air pollution controls such as [[wet scrubber]]s typically transfer the captured pollutants to the wastewater stream.&lt;ref name="EPA-steam-electric"&gt;{{cite web |date=2015-09-30 |title=Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/steam-electric-power-generating-effluent-guidelines-2015-final-rule |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ash pond]]s, a type of surface impoundment, are a widely used treatment technology at coal-fired plants. These ponds use gravity to [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|settle out]] large particulates (measured as [[total suspended solids]]) from power plant wastewater. This technology does not treat dissolved pollutants. Power stations use additional technologies to control pollutants, depending on the particular wastestream in the plant. These include dry ash handling, closed-loop ash recycling, [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]], biological treatment (such as an [[activated sludge]] process), membrane systems, and evaporation-crystallization systems.&lt;ref name="EPA-steam-electric"/&gt; Technological advancements in [[ion exchange membranes]] and [[electrodialysis]] systems has enabled high efficiency treatment of [[flue-gas desulfurization]] wastewater to meet recent EPA discharge limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lowering Cost and Waste in Flue Gas Desulfurization Wastewater Treatment|url=http://www.powermag.com/lowering-cost-waste-flue-gas-desulfurization-wastewater-treatment/|website=Power Mag|publisher=Electric Power|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment approach is similar for other highly scaling industrial wastewaters.

=== Food industry ===
Wastewater generated from agricultural and food operations has distinctive characteristics that set it apart from common municipal wastewater managed by public or private [[sewage treatment]] plants throughout the world: it is [[biodegradable]] and non-toxic, but has high concentrations of BOD and [[total suspended solids|suspended solids]] (SS).&lt;ref&gt;European Environment Agency. Copenhagen, Denmark. [http://themes.eea.europa.eu/Specific_media/water/indicators/bod/index_html "Indicator: Biochemical oxygen demand in rivers (2001)."]&lt;/ref&gt; The constituents of food and agriculture wastewater are often complex to predict, due to the differences in BOD and [[pH]] in effluents from vegetable, fruit, and meat products and due to the seasonal nature of food processing and post-harvesting.

Processing of food from raw materials requires large volumes of high grade water. Vegetable washing generates waters with high loads of [[Suspended solids|particulate matter]] and some dissolved [[organic matter]]. It may also contain surfactants.

Animal slaughter and processing produces very strong organic waste from body fluids, such as [[blood]], and [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] contents. This wastewater is frequently contaminated by significant levels of [[antibiotic]]s and growth [[hormone]]s from the animals and by a variety of pesticides used to control external [[parasite]]s.

Processing food for sale produces wastes generated from cooking which are often rich in plant [[organic material]] and may also contain [[salt]], [[flavouring]]s, [[color|colouring]] material and [[acid]]s or [[alkali]]. Very significant quantities of oil or fats may also be present.

Food processing activities such as plant cleaning, material conveying, bottling, and product washing create wastewater. Many food processing facilities require on-site treatment before operational wastewater can be land applied or discharged to a waterway or a sewer system. High suspended solids levels of organic particles increase BOD and can result in significant sewer surcharge fees. Sedimentation, wedgewire screening, or rotating belt filtration (microscreening) are commonly used methods to reduce suspended organic solids loading prior to discharge.

=== Iron and steel industry ===
The production of [[iron]] from its ores involves powerful [[Redox|reduction]] reactions in blast furnaces. Cooling waters are inevitably contaminated with products especially [[ammonia]] and [[cyanide]]. Production of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] from coal in coking plants also requires [[water cooling]] and the use of water in by-products separation. Contamination of waste streams includes gasification products such as [[benzene]], [[naphthalene]], [[anthracene]], cyanide, ammonia, [[phenol]]s, [[cresol]]s  together with a range of more complex [[organic compound]]s known collectively as [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAH).&lt;ref name="EPA ironsteel"&gt;{{cite report |date=2002 |title=Development Document for Final Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Iron and Steel Manufacturing Point Source Category |chapter=7. Wastewater Characterization |url=http://www.epa.gov/eg/iron-and-steel-manufacturing-effluent-guidelines-documents |publisher=EPA |pages=7-1ff |id=EPA 821-R-02-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conversion of iron or steel into sheet, wire or rods requires hot and cold mechanical transformation stages frequently employing water as a lubricant and coolant. Contaminants include [[hydraulic oil]]s, [[tallow]] and  particulate solids.
Final treatment of iron and steel products before onward sale into manufacturing includes ''pickling'' in strong mineral acid to remove rust and prepare the surface for [[tin]] or [[chromium]] plating or for other surface treatments such as [[galvanisation]] or [[paint]]ing.  The two acids commonly used are [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sulfuric acid]]. Wastewaters include acidic rinse waters together with waste acid. Although many plants operate acid recovery plants (particularly those using hydrochloric acid), where the mineral acid is boiled away from the iron salts, there remains a large volume of highly acid [[Iron(II) sulfate|ferrous sulfate]] or [[ferrous chloride]] to be disposed of. Many steel industry wastewaters are contaminated by hydraulic oil, also known as ''soluble oil.''

=== Mines and quarries ===
[[Image:Wastewater effluent.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Mine wastewater effluent in Peru, with neutralized pH from tailing runoff.]]
The principal waste-waters associated with [[mining|mine]]s and [[quarry|quarries]] are slurries of rock particles in water. These arise from rainfall washing exposed surfaces and haul roads and also from rock washing and grading processes. Volumes of water can be very high, especially rainfall related arisings on large sites.&lt;ref name="EPA-mineral mining"&gt;{{cite report |date=July 1979 |title=Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Mineral Mining and Processing Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/mineral-mining-and-processing-effluent-guidelines-documents |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 440/1-76/059b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some specialized separation operations, such as [[coal]] [[washing]] to separate coal from native rock using [[Density Gradient|density gradients]], can produce wastewater contaminated by fine particulate [[haematite]] and [[surfactants]]. [[Oil]]s and hydraulic oils are also common contaminants.&lt;ref name="EPA-coal mining"&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1982 |title=Development Document for the Coal Mining Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/coal-mining-effluent-guidelines-documents-related-1982-amendment |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 440/1-82/057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wastewater from metal mines and ore recovery plants are inevitably contaminated by the minerals present in the native rock formations. Following crushing and extraction of the desirable materials, undesirable materials may enter the wastewater stream. For metal mines, this can include unwanted metals such as [[zinc]] and other materials such as [[arsenic]]. Extraction of high value metals such as [[gold]] and [[silver]] may generate [[wikt:slime|slime]]s containing very fine particles in where physical removal of contaminants becomes particularly difficult.&lt;ref name="EPA-ore mining"&gt;{{cite report |date=November 1982 |title=Development Document for Final Effluent Limitations Guidelines and New Source Performance Standards for the Ore Mining and Dressing Point Source Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/ore-mining-and-dressing-effluent-guidelines-documents |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 440/1-82/061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the geologic formations that harbour economically valuable metals such as [[copper]] and [[gold]] very often consist of sulphide-type ores.  The processing entails grinding the rock into fine particles and then extracting the desired metal(s), with the leftover rock being known as tailings.  These tailings contain a combination of not only undesirable leftover metals, but also sulphide components which eventually form sulphuric acid upon the exposure to air and water that inevitably occurs when the tailings are disposed of in large impoundments. The resulting [[acid mine drainage]], which is often rich in heavy metals (because acids dissolve metals), is one of the many [[Environmental impact of mining|environmental impacts of mining]].&lt;ref name="EPA-ore mining"/&gt;

=== Nuclear industry ===
The waste production from the nuclear and radio-chemicals industry is dealt with as ''[[Radioactive waste]].''

=== Petroleum refining and petrochemicals ===
Pollutants discharged at petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants include [[conventional pollutant]]s (BOD, oil and grease, [[total suspended solids|suspended solids]]), ammonia, chromium, phenols and sulfides.&lt;ref name="EPA refineries"&gt;{{cite report |date=June 1985 |title=Guide for the Application of Effluent Limitations Guidelines for the Petroleum Refining Industry |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/petroleum-refining-effluent-guidelines-studies-and-guidance |publisher=EPA |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pulp and paper industry ===
Effluent from the [[pulp and paper industry]] is generally high in [[total suspended solids|suspended solids]] and BOD. Plants that [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleach wood pulp]] for paper making may generate [[chloroform]], [[dioxins]] (including [[2,3,7,8-TCDD]]), [[furans]], phenols and [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD).&lt;ref name="EPA pulppaper"&gt;{{cite report |date=2000 |title=Permit Guidance Document: Pulp, Paper and Paperboard Manufacturing Point Source Category |url=http://www.epa.gov/eg/pulp-paper-and-paperboard-effluent-guidelines |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-821-B-00-003 |pages=4-1ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stand-alone paper mills using imported pulp may only require simple primary treatment, such as [[sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] or [[dissolved air flotation]]. Increased BOD or COD loadings, as well as organic pollutants, may require biological treatment such as [[activated sludge]] or [[Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion|upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors]]. For mills with high inorganic loadings like salt, tertiary treatments may be required, either general membrane treatments like [[ultrafiltration]] or [[reverse osmosis]] or treatments to remove specific contaminants, such as nutrients.

=== Textile Dyeing ===
[[Dyeing|Textile dyeing]] plants generate wastewater that contain synthetic and natural dyestuff, gum thickener (guar) and various wetting agents, pH buffers and dye retardants or accelerators. Following treatment with polymer-based flocculants and settling agents, typical monitoring parameters include BOD, COD, color (ADMI), sulfide, oil and grease, phenol, [[Total suspended solids|TSS]] and heavy metals (chromium, [[zinc]], lead, copper).

===Industrial oil contamination===
Industrial applications where oil enters the wastewater stream may include vehicle wash bays, workshops, fuel storage depots, transport hubs and power generation. Often the wastewater is discharged into local sewer or trade waste systems and must meet local environmental specifications.  Typical contaminants can include solvents, detergents, grit. lubricants and hydrocarbons.

===Water treatment===
Many industries have a need to treat water to obtain very high quality water for demanding purposes such pure chemical synthesis or boiler feed water. Many water treatment produce organic and mineral sludges from [[filtration]] and [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]]. [[Ion exchange]] using natural or synthetic resins removes [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] and [[carbonate]] ions from water, typically replacing them with [[sodium]], [[chloride]], [[hydroxyl]] and/or other ions. Regeneration of ion exchange columns with strong acids and alkalis produces a wastewater rich in hardness ions which are readily precipitated out, especially when in admixture with other wastewater constituents.

===Wood preserving===
[[Wood preservation|Wood preserving]] plants generate conventional and toxic pollutants, including arsenic, COD, copper, chromium, abnormally high or low pH, phenols, oil &amp; grease, and suspended solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Timber Products Processing Effluent Guidelines |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/timber-products-processing-effluent-guidelines |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-03-13 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wool processing===
Insecticide residues in fleeces are a particular problem in treating waters generated in [[wool]] processing. Animal fats may be present in the wastewater, which if not contaminated, can be recovered for the production of tallow or further rendering.

== Treatment of industrial wastewater ==
The various types of contamination of wastewater require a variety of strategies to remove the contamination.&lt;ref name=Metcalf&gt;{{cite book|author=Tchobanoglous, G., Burton, F.L., and Stensel, H.D.|title=Wastewater Engineering (Treatment Disposal Reuse) / Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.|edition=4th|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|year=2003|isbn=0-07-041878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aqueous&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]] | edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=1967 | id= [[LCCN]] 67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brine treatment===
Brine treatment involves removing dissolved salt ions from the waste stream. Although similarities to seawater or brackish water [[desalination]] exist, industrial brine treatment may contain unique combinations of dissolved ions, such as hardness ions or other metals, necessitating specific processes and equipment.

Brine treatment systems are typically optimized to either reduce the volume of the final discharge for more economic disposal (as disposal costs are often based on volume) or maximize the recovery of fresh water or salts.  Brine treatment systems may also be optimized to reduce electricity consumption, chemical usage, or physical footprint.

Brine treatment is commonly encountered when treating cooling tower blowdown, [[produced water]] from [[Steam-assisted gravity drainage|steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)]], produced water from [[natural gas]] extraction such as [[Coalbed methane|coal seam gas]], frac flowback water, [[Acid mine drainage|acid mine or acid rock drainage]], reverse osmosis reject, [[Chloralkali process|chlor-alkali]] wastewater, pulp and paper mill effluent, and waste streams from food and beverage processing.

Brine treatment technologies may include: membrane filtration processes, such as [[reverse osmosis]]; ion exchange processes such as [[electrodialysis]] or [[Ion-exchange resin|weak acid cation exchange]]; or evaporation processes, such as brine concentrators and [[Crystallization#Evaporative crystallizers|crystallizers]] employing [[mechanical vapour recompression]] and steam.

[[Reverse osmosis]] may not be viable for brine treatment, due to the potential for fouling caused by hardness salts or organic contaminants, or damage to the reverse osmosis membranes from [[hydrocarbons]].

Evaporation processes are the most widespread for brine treatment as they enable the highest degree of concentration, as high as solid salt. They also produce the highest purity effluent, even distillate-quality. Evaporation processes are also more tolerant of organics, hydrocarbons, or hardness salts. However, energy consumption is high and corrosion may be an issue as the prime mover is concentrated salt water. As a result, evaporation systems typically employ [[titanium]] or [[Stainless steel#Types of stainless steel|duplex stainless steel]] materials.

====Brine management====
Brine management examines the broader context of brine treatment and may include consideration of government policy and regulations, [[corporate sustainability]], environmental impact, recycling, handling and transport, containment, centralized compared to on-site treatment, avoidance and reduction, technologies, and economics. Brine management shares some issues with [[Leachate#Leachate management|leachate management]] and more general [[waste management]].

=== Solids removal ===
Most solids can be removed using simple sedimentation techniques with the solids recovered as [[slurry]] or sludge. Very fine solids and solids with densities close to the density of water pose special problems. In such case filtration or [[ultrafiltration]] may be required. Although, [[flocculation]] may be used, using [[alum]] salts or the addition of [[polyelectrolyte]]s. Wastewater from industrial food processing often requires on-site treatment before it can be discharged to prevent or reduce sewer surcharge fees. The type of industry and specific operational practices determine what types of wastewater is generated and what type of treatment is required. Reducing solids such as waste product, organic materials, and sand is often a goal of industrial wastewater treatment. Some common ways to reduce solids include primary sedimentation (clarification), Dissolved Air Flotation or (DAF), belt filtration (microscreening), and drum screening.

=== Oils and grease removal ===
The effective removal of oils and grease is dependent on the characteristics of the oil in terms of its suspension state and droplet size, which will in turn affect the choice of separator technology.
Oil in industrial waste water may be free light oil, heavy oil, which tends to sink, and emulsified oil, often referred to as soluble oil. Emulsified or soluble oils will typically required "cracking" to free the oil from its emulsion. In most cases this is achieved by lowering the pH of the water matrix.

Most separator technologies will have an optimum range of oil droplet sizes that can be effectively treated. 

Analysing the oily water to determine droplet size can be performed with a video particle analyser. 
Each separator technology will have its own performance curve outlining optimum performance based on oil droplet size. the most common separators are gravity tanks or pits, API oil-water separators or plate packs, chemical treatment via DAFs, centrifuges, media filters and hydrocyclones.

;API separators
{{Main|API oil-water separator }}
[[Image:API Separator.png|thumb|right|375px|A typical API oil-water separator used in many industries]]
Many oils can be recovered from open water surfaces by skimming devices. Considered a dependable and cheap way to remove oil, grease and other hydrocarbons from water, oil skimmers can sometimes achieve the desired level of water purity. At other times, skimming is also a cost-efficient method to remove most of the oil before using membrane filters and chemical processes. Skimmers will prevent filters from blinding prematurely and keep chemical costs down because there is less oil to process.

Because grease skimming involves higher viscosity hydrocarbons, skimmers must be equipped with heaters powerful enough to keep grease fluid for discharge. If floating grease forms into solid clumps or mats, a spray bar, aerator or mechanical apparatus can be used to facilitate removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hobson |first=Tom |date=May 2004 |title=The Scoop on Oil Skimmers |url=http://eponline.com/articles/2004/05/01/the-scoop-on-oil-skimmers.aspx |journal=Environmental Protection (formerly Water and Wastewater News) |publisher=1105 Media, Inc. |location=Dallas, TX |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, hydraulic oils and the majority of oils that have degraded to any extent will also have a soluble or emulsified component that will require further treatment to eliminate. Dissolving or emulsifying oil using surfactants or [[solvent]]s usually exacerbates the problem rather than solving it, producing wastewater that is more difficult to treat.

The wastewaters from large-scale industries such as [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[Petrochemical|petrochemical plants]], [[chemical plant]]s, and [[Natural gas processing|natural gas processing plant]]s commonly contain gross amounts of oil and suspended solids. Those industries use a device known as an [[API oil-water separator]] which is designed to separate the oil and suspended solids from their wastewater [[effluents]]. The name is derived from the fact that such separators are designed according to standards published by the [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API).&lt;ref name=Aqueous/&gt;&lt;ref name=API421&gt;{{cite book|author=[[American Petroleum Institute|American Petroleum Institute (API)]]|title=Management of Water Discharges: Design and Operations of Oil-Water Separators|edition=1st|publisher=American Petroleum Institute|date=February 1990|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The API separator is a gravity separation device designed by using [[Stokes Law]] to define the rise velocity of oil droplets based on their [[density]] and size. The design is based on the [[specific gravity]] difference between the oil and the wastewater because that difference is much smaller than the specific gravity difference between the suspended solids and water. The suspended solids settles to the bottom of the separator as a sediment layer, the oil rises to top of the separator and the cleansed wastewater is the middle layer between the oil layer and the solids.&lt;ref name=Aqueous/&gt;

Typically, the oil layer is skimmed off and subsequently re-processed or disposed of, and the bottom sediment layer is removed by a chain and flight scraper (or similar device) and a sludge pump. The water layer is sent to further treatment for additional removal of any residual oil and then to some type of biological treatment unit for removal of undesirable dissolved chemical compounds.

[[Image:Parallel Plate Separator.png|thumb|right|375px|A typical parallel plate separator&lt;ref name=HP&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beychok, Milton R. |date=December 1971 |title=Wastewater treatment |journal=Hydrocarbon Processing |volume= |issue= |pages=109–112 |issn=0887-0284}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Parallel plate separators are similar to API separators but they include tilted parallel plate assemblies (also known as parallel packs). The parallel plates provide more surface for suspended oil droplets to coalesce into larger globules. Such separators still depend upon the specific gravity between the suspended oil and the water. However, the parallel plates enhance the degree of oil-water separation. The result is that a parallel plate separator requires significantly less space than a conventional API separator to achieve the same degree of separation.&lt;ref name=HP/&gt;

;Hydrocyclone oil separators
[[Hydrocyclone|Hydrocyclone oil separators]] operate on the process where wastewater enters the cyclone chamber and is 
spun under extreme centrifugal forces more than 1000 times the force of gravity. This force causes the water 
and oil droplets to separate. The separated oil is discharged from one end of the cyclone where treated 
water is discharged through the opposite end for further treatment, filtration or discharge.

=== Removal of biodegradable organics ===
Biodegradable organic material of plant or animal origin is usually possible to treat using extended conventional [[sewage treatment]] processes such as [[activated sludge]] or [[trickling filter]].&lt;ref name=Metcalf/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aqueous/&gt; Problems can arise if the wastewater is excessively diluted with washing water or is highly  concentrated such as undiluted blood or milk. The presence of cleaning agents, disinfectants, pesticides, or antibiotics can have detrimental impacts on treatment processes.

==== Activated sludge process ====
{{Main|Activated sludge}}
[[Image:Activated Sludge 1.svg|thumb|right|300 px|A generalized diagram of an activated sludge process.]]
Activated sludge is a [[biochemical]] process for treating sewage and industrial wastewater that uses air (or [[oxygen]]) and [[microorganism]]s to [[Biological oxidizer|biologically oxidize]] organic pollutants, producing a waste sludge (or [[Flocculation|floc]]) containing the oxidized material. In general, an activated sludge process includes:
* An aeration tank where air (or oxygen) is injected and thoroughly mixed into the wastewater.
* A settling tank (usually referred to as a [[clarifier]] or "settler") to allow the waste sludge to settle. Part of the waste sludge is recycled to the aeration tank and the remaining waste sludge is removed for further treatment and ultimate disposal.

==== Trickling filter process ====
{{Main|Trickling filter}}
[[Image:Trickle Filter Cross-section.png|thumb|right|250px|Image 1: A schematic cross-section of the contact face of the bed media in a trickling filter]]
[[Image:Trickle Filter.svg|thumb|right|264px|A typical complete trickling filter system]]
A '''trickling filter''' consists of a bed of [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[gravel]], [[slag]], [[peat moss]], or plastic media over which wastewater flows  downward and contacts a layer (or film) of [[microbial]] slime covering the bed media. [[wikt:aerobic|Aerobic]] conditions are maintained  by forced air flowing through the bed or by natural convection of air. The process involves [[adsorption]] of organic compounds in the wastewater by the microbial slime layer, diffusion of air into the slime layer to provide the oxygen required for the biochemical [[oxidation]] of the organic compounds. The end products include [[carbon dioxide]] gas, water and other products of the oxidation. As the slime layer thickens, it becomes difficult for the air to penetrate the layer and an inner anaerobic layer is formed.

The fundamental components of a complete trickling filter system are:
* A bed of filter medium upon which a layer of microbial slime is promoted and developed.
* An enclosure or a container which houses the bed of filter medium.
* A system for distributing the flow of wastewater over the filter medium.
* A system for removing and disposing of any sludge from the treated effluent.

The treatment of sewage or other wastewater with trickling filters is among the oldest and most well characterized treatment technologies.

A trickling filter is also often called a ''trickle filter'', ''trickling biofilter'', ''[[biofilter]]'', ''biological filter'' or ''biological trickling filter''.

=== Removal of other organics ===
Synthetic organic materials including solvents, paints, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, products from [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] production and so forth can be very difficult to treat. Treatment methods are often specific to the material being treated. Methods include [[advanced oxidation process]]ing, [[distillation]], adsorption, [[Glass transition|vitrification]], [[incineration]], chemical immobilisation or landfill disposal. Some materials such as some detergents may be capable of biological degradation and in such cases, a modified form of wastewater treatment can be used.

=== Removal of acids and alkalis ===
Acids and alkalis can usually be [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralised]] under controlled conditions. Neutralisation frequently produces a [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] that will require treatment as a solid residue that may also be toxic. In some cases, gases may be evolved requiring treatment for the gas stream. Some other forms of treatment are usually required following neutralisation.

Waste streams rich in [[hard water|hardness]] ions as from de-ionisation processes can readily lose the hardness ions in a buildup of precipitated calcium and magnesium salts. This precipitation process can cause severe ''furring'' of pipes and can, in extreme cases, cause the blockage of disposal pipes.  A 1-metre diameter industrial marine discharge pipe serving a major chemicals complex was blocked by such salts in the 1970s. Treatment is by concentration of de-ionisation waste waters and disposal to landfill or by careful pH management of the released wastewater.

=== Removal of toxic materials ===
Toxic materials including many organic materials, metals (such as zinc, silver, [[cadmium]], [[thallium]], etc.) acids, alkalis, non-metallic elements (such as arsenic or [[selenium]]) are generally resistant to biological processes unless very dilute. Metals can often be precipitated out by changing the pH or by treatment with other chemicals. Many, however, are resistant to treatment or mitigation and may require concentration followed by landfilling or recycling. Dissolved organics can be ''incinerated'' within the wastewater by the advanced oxidation process.

====Smart capsules====
[[Molecular encapsulation]] is a technology that has the potential to provide a system for the recyclable removal of lead and other ions from polluted sources. Nano-, micro- and milli- capsules, with sizes in the ranges 10&amp;nbsp;nm-1μm,1μm-1mm and &gt;1mm, respectively, are particles that have an active reagent (core) surrounded by a carrier (shell).There are three types of capsule under investigation: [[alginate]]-based capsules, [[carbon nanotubes]], polymer swelling capsules. These capsules provide a possible means for the remediation of contaminated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lead: Its Effects on Environment and Health|last2=Jastrząb|first2=Renata|publisher=de Gruyter|series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences|volume=17|publication-date=2017|pages=61–78|chapter=Chapter 4.

The field, originally theorized by [[Alan Guth]],&lt;ref name="Guth1997" /&gt; provides a mechanism by which a period of rapid [[metric expansion of space|expansion]] from 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;35&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;34&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[second]]s after the [[Big Bang|initial expansion]] can be generated, forming a universe consistent with observed spatial isotropy and homogeneity.

==Cosmological inflation==
{{main|Inflation (cosmology)}}

The basic{{clarify|date=October 2016}} model of inflation proceeds in three phases:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|author=Tsujikawa, Shinji|title=Introductory review of cosmic inflation|year=2003|eprint=hep-ph/0304257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Slow roll and reheating

===Expanding vacuum state with high potential energy===

In [[quantum field theory]], a [[vacuum state]] or vacuum is a state of quantum fields which is at locally minimal potential energy. Quantum particles are excitations which deviate from a minimal potential energy state, therefore a vacuum state has no particles in it. Depending on the specifics of a quantum field theory, it can have more than one vacuum state. Different vacua, despite all "being empty" (having no particles), will generally have different [[vacuum energy]]. Quantum field theory stipulates that the pressure of the vacuum energy is always negative and equal in magnitude to its energy density.

Inflationary theory postulates that there is a vacuum state with very large vacuum energy, caused by a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the inflaton field. Any region of space in this state will rapidly expand. Even if initially it is not empty (contains some particles), very rapid exponential expansion dilutes particle density to zero.

===Phase transition to true vacuum===

Inflationary theory further postulates that this "inflationary" vacuum state is not the state with globally lowest energy – it's a [[false vacuum]]. This is also known as a [[metastable]] state. For each observer in any chosen point of space, false vacuum eventually tunnels into a state with the same potential energy, but which isn't a vacuum (it is not at a local minimum of the potential energy, it "can decay"). This state can be seen as a true vacuum, filled with a large number of inflaton particles. However, rate of expansion of the true vacuum does not change at this moment – only its exponential character changes to much slower expansion of [[FLRW metric]]. This ensures that expansion rate precisely matches the energy density.

===Slow roll and reheating===

In true vacuum, inflaton particles decay, eventually giving rise to the observed Standard Model particles. The shape of the potential energy function near "tunnel exit" from false vacuum state must have a shallow slope, otherwise particle production will be confined to the boundary of expanding true vacuum bubble, which contradicts observation (our Universe is not built of huge completely void bubbles). In other words, the quantum state should "roll to the bottom slowly".

When complete, the decay of inflaton particles fills the space with hot and dense Big Bang plasma.

==Field quanta==

Just like every other quantum field, excitations of the inflaton field are expected to be quantized.  The field quanta of the inflaton field are known as '''inflatons'''.  Depending on the modeled potential energy density, the inflaton field's [[ground state]] may or may not be zero.

The term ''inflaton'' follows the typical naming style{{clarify|date=October 2016}} of other quantum particles (such as [[photon]], [[gluon]], [[boson]] and [[fermion]]), deriving from the word ''inflation''. The term was first used in a paper entitled ‘After Primordial Inflation’ by, D.V. Nanopoulos, K.A. Olive and M. Srednicki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0370269383916246 | doi=10.1016/0370-2693(83)91624-6 | volume=127 | title=After primordial inflation | year=1983 | journal=Physics Letters B | pages=30–34 | author=Nanopoulos D.V., Olive K.A., Srednicki M.| bibcode=1983PhLB..127...30N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of the inflaton field is currently not known. One of the obstacles for narrowing its properties down is the inability of QFTs to correctly predict vacuum energy based on the particle content of a chosen theory (see [[Cosmological constant problem|vacuum catastrophe]]). Atkins (2012) has suggested that it is even possible that no new field is necessary, that a modified version of the [[Higgs field]] could act as an inflaton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Atkins, Michael|title=Could the Higgs Boson Be the Inflaton?|date=March 2012|url=http://indico.cern.ch/event/180122/material/slides/0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-minimally coupled inflation==

'''Non-minimally coupled inflation''' is an [[cosmic inflation|inflationary]] model in which the constant which couples [[gravity]] to the [[inflaton field]] is not small. The [[coupling constant]] is usually represented by &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; ([[Xi (letter)|Xi]]), which features in the [[action (physics)|action]] (constructed by modifying the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]]):&lt;ref name=hertzberg12&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; represents the strength of the interaction between &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, which relate to the curvature of space and the magnitude of the inflaton field respectively.

Jef Raskin was born in [[New York City]] to a secular [[Jew]]ish family,&lt;ref&gt;Jef Raskin, "Meeting Merlin", http://www.digibarn.com/stories/raskin-merlin8/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; whose surname is a [[matronymic]] from "Raske", Yiddish nickname for Rachel. He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[mathematics]] and a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in [[physics]] with minors in [[philosophy]] and [[music]] from the [[Stony Brook University|State University of New York at Stony Brook]].&lt;ref name="ubiquity.acm.org"&gt;A Conversation with Jef Raskin, http://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=941396&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, he received a [[master's degree]] in [[computer science]] from [[Pennsylvania State University]], after having switched from [[mathematical logic]] due to differences of opinion with his advisor. Even though he had completed work for his PhD, the university was not accredited for a PhD in computer science.&lt;ref name="ubiquity.acm.org"/&gt; The first original computer application he wrote was a music application as part of his master's thesis.

Raskin later enrolled in a graduate music program at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD), but stopped to teach art, photography, and computer science there. He worked as an assistant professor in the Visual Arts department from 1968 until 1974.  He was awarded a National Science Foundation grant to establish a Computer and Humanities center which used a [[16-bit]] [[Data General Nova]] computer and graphic display terminals rather than the teletypes which were in use at that time.

Along with his undergraduate student Jonathan (Jon) Collins, Raskin developed the Flow Programming Language for use in teaching programming to the art and humanities students.  The language was first used at the Humanities Summer Training Institute held in 1970 at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas. The language has only 6 instructions (&lt;code&gt;get it&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;print it&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;print "text"&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jump to&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;if it is ' ' then&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt;) and can not manipulate numbers. The language utilizes "typing amplification" in which only the first letter is typed and the computer provides the balance of the instruction eliminating typing errors. It was also the basis for programming classes taught by Raskin and Collins in the UCSD Visual Arts Department.

Raskin curated several art shows including one featuring his collection of unusual toys. It was during this period that he changed the spelling of his name from "Jeff" to "Jef" after having met Jon Collins and liking the lack of extraneous letters.

Raskin occasionally wrote for computer publications, such as ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]''. He formed a company named Bannister and Crun, which was named for two characters playing in the [[BBC]] radio comedy ''[[The Goon Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=The_Father_of_The_Macintosh.txt|title=Folklore.org: The Father Of The Macintosh|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101055018/http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=The_Father_of_The_Macintosh.txt|archivedate=November 1, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career history==
===Apple===
====Contractor writer====
Raskin first met Apple Computer co-founders [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Steve Wozniak]] in their garage workshop following the debut of their [[Apple II]] personal computer at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. Jobs hired Raskin's company Bannister and Crun to write the Apple II [[BASIC]] Programming Manual. Raskin said "I was talking fifty dollars a page. They talked fifty dollars for the whole manual." Upon the Apple II unit with the serial number of "2", he reportedly wrote "a literate manual that became a standard for the young industry".&lt;ref name="Insanely Great"/&gt;{{rp|108}}

====Management====
In January 1978, Raskin joined Apple as Manager of Publications, the company's 31st employee. For some time he continued as Director of Publications and New Product Review, and also worked on packaging and other issues. He had concealed his degree in computer science, out of concern for cultural bias against academia among the hobby-driven personal computer industry. He explained, "If they had known ... they might not have let me in the company, because there was such an antiacademic bias in the early Apple days."&lt;ref name="Insanely Great"/&gt;{{rp|108}}

From his responsibility for documentation and testing, Raskin had great influence on early engineering projects. Because the Apple II only displayed uppercase characters on a 40-column screen, his department used the [[Polymorphic Systems 8813]] (an Intel-8080-based machine running a proprietary operating system called Exec) to write documentation; this spurred the development of an 80-column display card and a suitable [[text editor]] for the Apple II. His experiences testing [[Applesoft BASIC]] inspired him to design a competing product, called Notzo BASIC, which was never implemented. When Wozniak developed the first [[disk drive]]s for the Apple II, Raskin went back to his contacts at UCSD and encouraged them to port the UCSD [[P-System]] [[operating system]] (incorporating a version of the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal programming language]]) to it, which Apple later licensed and shipped as [[Apple Pascal]].

Through this time, Raskin continually wrote memos about how the personal computer could become a true consumer appliance. While the [[Apple III]] was under development in 1978 and '79, Raskin was lobbying for Apple to create a radically different kind of computer that was designed from the start to be easy to use. In ''Computers by the Millions'', he stated that expandable computers like the Apple II were too complex, and development was difficult due to the unknown nature of the machine the program ran on.&lt;ref name=mil&gt;Jef Raskin, [http://www.digibarn.com/friends/jef-raskin/writings/millions.html "Computers by the Millions"], 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The machine he envisioned was very different from the Macintosh that was eventually released and had much more in common with [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]] than modern [[desktop metaphor|desktop]]-based machines.

====Macintosh====
[[File:Macintosh 128k transparency.png|thumb|left|The original [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh 128k]]]]
Raskin started the [[Macintosh]] project in 1979 to implement some of these ideas. He later hired his former student [[Bill Atkinson]] from UCSD to work at Apple, along with [[Andy Hertzfeld]] and [[Burrell Smith]] from the Apple Service Department, which was located in the same building as the Publications Department. Secretly bypassing Jobs's ego and authority by continually securing permission and funding directly at the executive level, Raskin created and solely supervised the Macintosh project for approximately its first year. This included selecting the name of his favorite apple, writing the mission document ''The Book of Macintosh'', securing office space, and recruiting and managing the original staff.&lt;ref name="Insanely Great"/&gt;{{rp|111}} Author Steven Levy said, "It was Raskin who provided the powerful vision of a computer whose legacy would be low cost, high utility, and a groundbreaking friendliness."&lt;ref name="Insanely Great"&gt;{{cite book | first=Steven | last=Levy | author-link=Steven Levy | date=2000 | orig-year=1994 | publisher=Penguin Books | location=[[New York City]] | title=Insanely Great: The Life and Times of Macintosh, the Computer That Changed Everything | ISBN=0140291776 | oclc=474924791}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122}}

The machine was similar in power to the Apple II and included a small 9-inch black-and-white character [[Cathode ray tube|display]] built into a small case with a floppy disk. It was text only, as Raskin disliked the computer mouse or anything else that could take his hands from the keyboard.&lt;ref name="Insanely Great"/&gt;{{rp|111}} A number of basic applications were built into the machine, selectable by pressing function keys. The machine also included logic that would understand user intentions and switch programs dynamically. For instance, if the user simply started typing text it would switch into editor mode, and if they typed numbers it would switch to calculator mode. In many cases these switches would be largely invisible to the user.

In 1981, after the [[Apple Lisa]] team had "kicked him out", [[Steve Jobs]]'s attention drew toward Raskin's Macintosh project, intending to marry the [[Xerox PARC]]-inspired [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-based Lisa design to Raskin's appliance-computing, "computers-by-the-millions" concept. [[Steve Wozniak]] was on hiatus from the company following a traumatic airplane accident, allowing Jobs to take managerial lead over the project.&lt;ref name=TheVerge&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Wozniak on Newton, Tesla, and why the original Macintosh was a 'lousy' product|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/27/4468314/steve-wozniak-on-how-the-newton-changed-his-life|accessdate=June 23, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312014832/http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/27/4468314/steve-wozniak-on-how-the-newton-changed-his-life|archivedate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Raskin takes credit for being one of the first to introduce Jobs and the Lisa engineers to the PARC concepts, though he ultimately dismissed PARC's technology and opposed the use of computer mouse.&lt;ref name="Insanely Great"/&gt;{{rp|110}} Raskin also claims to have had continued direct input into the eventual Mac design, including the [[Computer mouse#Specific uses|decision]] to use a one-button mouse as part of the Apple interface, a departure from the [[Xerox PARC]]'s 3-button mouse.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Others, including [[Larry Tesler]], acknowledge his advocacy for a one-button mouse but say that it was a decision reached simultaneously by others at Apple who had a stronger say on the issue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Raskin later stated that were he to redesign the mouse it would have three clearly labeled buttons—two buttons on top marked "Select" and "Activate", and a "Grab" button on the side that could be used by squeezing the mouse.&lt;ref&gt;''The Humane Interface'' Appendix A, Pg. 209, last paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; This description nearly fits the [[Apple Mighty Mouse]] (renamed "Apple Mouse" in 2009), first marketed in 2005. It has the three described buttons (two invisible), but they are assigned to different functions than Raskin specified for his own interface and can be customized.

In a 2005 NerdTV interview which is available as a bonus feature of the DVD ''Steve Jobs - The Lost Interview'' (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magpictures.com/stevejobsthelostinterview/ |title=Steve Jobs - The Lost Interview |accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macintosh project member [[Andy Hertzfeld]] relates an anecdote about Raskin's reputation for often inaccurately claiming to have invented various technologies.  Raskin's resume from 2002 lends credence by stating he was "Creator of Macintosh computer at Apple Computer, Inc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://humane.sourceforge.net/home/curriculum_vitae.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003011354/http://humane.sourceforge.net/home/curriculum_vitae.html |archivedate=October 3, 2003 |title=Jef Raskin - Curriculum Vitae |date=January 8, 2002 |accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Raskin did create and solely supervise the Macintosh project for approximately its first year;&lt;ref name="Insanely Great"/&gt;{{rp|111}} however, Hertzfeld describes Raskin's relationship to the drastically different finished Mac product more like that of an "eccentric great uncle" than its father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=The_Father_of_The_Macintosh.txt|title=Folklore.org: The Father Of The Macintosh|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/October-2011/Steve-Jobs-Jef-Raskin-and-the-Humane-Interface/|title=Steve Jobs, Jef Raskin, and The Humane Interface|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jobs's "Lost Interview" from 1996, he refers to the Macintosh as a product of team effort while acknowledging Raskin's early role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/25/steve-jobs-biography-walter-isaacson-review|title=Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography by Walter Isaacson – review|last=Leith|first=Sam|date=2011-10-25|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple acknowledged Raskin's role after he had left the company by giving him as a gift, the millionth Macintosh computer, with an engraved brass plaque on the front.

===Pioneering the information appliance===
Raskin left Apple in 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/28/business/jef-raskin-61-developer-of-apple-macintosh-is-dead.html|title=Jef Raskin, 61, Developer of Apple Macintosh, Is Dead|first=Andrea|last=Elliott|date=February 28, 2005|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formed Information Appliance, Inc. to implement the concepts of his original Macintosh concept. The first product was the SwyftCard, a firmware card for the [[Apple II]] containing an integrated application suite, also released on a disk as SwyftWare. Information Appliance later developed the Swyft as a stand-alone laptop computer. Raskin licensed this design to [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], which shipped a similar desktop product as the [[Canon Cat]]. Released in 1987, the unit had an innovative interface that attracted much interest but it did not become a commercial success. Raskin claimed that its failure was due in some part to Steve Jobs, who successfully pitched Canon on the [[NeXT Computer]] at about the same time. It has also been suggested that Canon canceled the CAT due to internal rivalries within its divisions. After running a cryptic full page advertisement in the "Wall Street Journal" that the "Canon CAT is coming" months before it was available, Canon failed to follow through, never airing the completed TV commercial when the CAT went on sale, only allowed the CAT to be sold by its typewriter sales people, and prevented Raskin from selling the CAT directly with a TV demonstration of how easy it was to use. Shortly thereafter, the stock market crash of 1987 so panicked Information Appliance's venture capitalists that they drained millions of dollars from the company, depriving it of the capital needed to be able to manufacture and sell the Swyft.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Raskin also wrote a book, ''[[The Humane Interface]]'' (2000),&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, Jef 2000.''The Humane Interface'', Addison-Wesley {{ISBN|0-201-37937-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he developed his ideas about human-computer interfaces.&lt;!-- (see ''[[#Cognetics|C --&gt;

Raskin was a long-time member of BAYCHI, the Bay-Area Computer-Human Interface group, a professional organization for human-interface designers. He presented papers on his own work, reviewed the human interfaces of various consumer products (such as a [[BMW]] car he'd been asked to review), and discussed the work of his colleagues in various companies and universities.

At the start of the new millennium, Raskin undertook the building of a new computer interface based on his 30 years of work and research, called [[The Humane Environment]], THE. On January 1, 2005, he renamed it [[Archy]]. It is a system incarnating his concepts of the humane interface, by using [[open source]] elements within his rendition of a ZUI or [[Zooming User Interface]]. In the same period Raskin accepted an appointment as Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the [[University of Chicago]]'s Computer Science Department and, with [[Leo Irakliotis]], started designing a new curriculum on humane interfaces and computer enterprises.

His work is being extended and carried on by his son [[Aza Raskin]] at [[Humanized Inc.|Humanized]], a company that was started shortly after Raskin's death to continue his legacy. Humanized released [[Enso (software)|Enso]], a linguistic command-line interface, which is based on Jef's work and dedicated in his memory. In early 2008, Humanized became part of [[Mozilla Foundation|Mozilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://humanized.com/weblog/2008/01/16/joining-mozilla/ |title=Humanized Joining Mozilla |publisher=Humanized Inc. |date=January 16, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120152125/http://www.humanized.com/weblog/2008/01/16/joining-mozilla |archivedate=January 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Archy project never managed to include a functional ZUI, a third party developed a commercial application called Raskin inspired by the same [[Zoomworld]] ZUI idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macstories.net/reviews/raskin/|title=Raskin, A Finder Replacement for Mac|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raskinformac.com/|title=Raskin - Beyond Desktop - Raskin Beta|first=Raskin Apps / Media, Raskin Software LLC,|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netzwelt.de/news/89980-raskin-mac-dateien-ordner-vogelperspektive.html Introduction to Zooming with Raskin] (german)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cognetics====

Raskin expanded the meaning of the term "cognetics" in his book ''The Humane Interface'' to mean "the [[ergonomics]] of the mind". According to Raskin Center, "Cognetics brings interface design out of the mystic realm of guruism, transforming it into an engineering discipline with a rigorous theoretical framework."

The term cognetics had earlier been coined and trademarked by [[Charles Kreitzberg]] in 1982 when he started [[Cognetics Corporation]], one of the first user experience design companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Clifford |url=http://www.upassoc.org/upa_publications/upa_voice/volumes/2007/october/kreitzberg.html |title=UPA Voice - October 2007 - Thumbnail: Charlie Kreitzberg |publisher=Upassoc.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222154314/http://www.upassoc.org/upa_publications/upa_voice/volumes/2007/october/kreitzberg.html |archivedate=February 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to describe educational programs intended to foster thinking skills in grades 3-12 (US)&lt;ref&gt;Burr, J. et al., Cognetics: Thinking Skills Activities in Inventions/Technology and Science. Teacher's Manual and Student Manual. Philadelphia, PA: RBS Publications, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and for Cognetics, Inc., an economic research firm founded by [[David L. Birch]], a Professor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFDF1639F932A35756C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=The Little Engine That Could | date=May 1, 1988 | accessdate=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raskin discouraged using the informal term "[[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]]" in user interface design, claiming that easy to use interfaces are often due to exposure to previous, similar systems, thus the term "familiar" should be preferred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asktog.com/papers/raskinintuit.html Intuitive equals familiar], Communications of the ACM. 37:9, September 1994, pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Aiming for "intuitive" interfaces (based on reusing existing skills with interaction systems) could lead designers to discard a better design solution only because it would require a novel approach.

==Outside interests==
While best known as a computer scientist, Raskin also had other interests. He conducted the San Francisco Chamber Opera Society and played various instruments, including the [[organ (music)|organ]] and the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]. His artwork was displayed at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] as part of its permanent collection, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the University of California, San Diego. He received a patent for airplane wing construction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jef.raskincenter.org/home/curriculum_vitae.html |title= Jef Raskin – Curriculum Vitae |accessdate=2012-04-09 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720100442/http://jef.raskincenter.org/home/curriculum_vitae.html |archivedate= July 20, 2007 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designed and marketed radio controlled model [[Glider aircraft |gliders]].

He was said to be an accomplished [[archery |archer]], target shooter, bicycle racer and an occasional model race car driver.{{citation needed|date= July 2016}}  He was a passionate musician and composer, publishing a series of collected recorder studies using the pseudonym of Aabel Aabius.{{citation needed |date= July 2016}} In his later years he also wrote free-lance articles for Macintosh magazines, such as ''[[MacHomeJournal]]'' as well as many modeling magazines, ''[[Forbes (magazine) |Forbes]]'', ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', and computing journals.{{citation needed|date= July 2016}} One of his most favorite pastimes was to play music with his children. He would accompany them on the piano while they played or sang while going through old [[fake book |fake-books]] passed down from his father. They would also routinely improvise together.{{citation needed |date=July 2016}}

Raskin owned a small company, "Jef's Friends", which made and sold model airplane kits through hobby shops.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

One of Raskin's instruments was the organ. In 1978 he published an article in ''[[BYTE]]'' on using computers with the instrument.&lt;ref name= "raskin197803"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1978-03/1978_03_BYTE_03-03_Computer_Music_Systems#page/n57/mode/2up | title=The Microcomputer and the Pipe Organ | work=BYTE | date=March 1978 | accessdate= October 17, 2013 | last =Raskin | first = Jef | page= 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raskin published a paper highly critical of pseudoscience in nursing, such as [[therapeutic touch]] and [[Person-centered therapy |rogerian science]], wherein he said: "Unlike science, nursing theory has no built-in mechanisms for rejecting falsehoods, tautologies, and irrelevancies."&lt;ref name= "Humbug"&gt;{{cite journal | magazine=Skeptical Inquirer | title= Rogerian nursing theory: A humbug in the halls of higher learning | date= 2000 | volume= 24 | issue= 5 | pages=30–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Raskin |first =Jef |title= Humbug: Nursing Theory |url=http://www.jefraskin.com/forjef2/jefweb-compiled/published/NursingTheoryForSite.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010710223205/http://www.jefraskin.com/forjef2/jefweb-compiled/published/NursingTheoryForSite.html| archivedate= July 10, 2001 | accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Jef Raskin married Linda S. Blum in 1982. They had three children together—[[Aza Raskin|Aza]], Aviva, and Aenea, with honorary/surrogate siblings R. Fureigh and Jenna Mandis.

He was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] in December 2004 and died in [[Pacifica, California]], on February 26, 2005, at age 61.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/28/business/28raskin.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Andrea | last=Elliott | title=Jef Raskin, 61, Developer of Apple Macintosh, Is Dead | date=February 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A-major f-sharp-minor.svg|thumb|right|150px|Key signature [[A major]] / [[F-sharp minor|F{{music|#}} minor]] with three sharps placed after the clef.]]

In [[musical notation]], a '''key signature''' is a set of [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] ({{Music|sharp}}), [[Flat (music)|flat]] ({{Music|b}}), and rarely, [[Natural (music)|natural]] ({{Music|natural}}) symbols placed together on the [[staff (music)|staff]].  Key signatures are generally written immediately after the [[clef]] at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a [[Sheet music|score]], notably after a [[Bar (music)|double barline]].

A key signature designates [[note (music)|note]]s that are to be played higher or lower than the corresponding [[natural sign|natural]] notes and applies through to the end of the piece or up to the next key signature.  A sharp symbol on a line or space in the key signature raises the notes on that line or space one [[semitone]] above the natural, and a flat lowers such notes one semitone.  Further, a symbol in the key signature affects all the notes of one letter: for instance, a sharp on the top line of the [[Clef#Treble clef|treble staff]] applies to Fs not only on that line, but also to Fs in the bottom space of the staff, and to any other Fs. This convention was not universal until the late [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and early [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], however; music published in the 1720s and 1730s, for example, uses key signatures showing sharps or flats on both octaves for notes which fall within the staff.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

An [[Accidental (music)|accidental]] is an exception to the key signature, applying only in the measure in which it appears.

Although a key signature may be written using any combination of sharp and flat symbols, the most common series of thirteen homogeneous key signatures—ranging from six flats to six sharps, with each successive flat or sharp placed on the [[circle of fifths|note a perfect fifth below or above]], respectively, the previous one—is assumed in much of this article.  A piece scored using a single diatonic key signature and no accidentals contains notes of at most seven of the twelve [[pitch class]]es, which seven being determined by the particular key signature.

Each [[Major scale|major]] and [[Minor scale|minor]] [[key (music)|key]] has an associated key signature that sharpens or flattens the notes which are used in its scale. However, it is not uncommon for a piece to be written with a key signature that does not match its key, for example, in some Baroque pieces,&lt;ref&gt;Schulenberg, David. ''Music of the Baroque''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=P4x3aKvOQWAC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;vq=%22the+key+of+a+baroque+work%22&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U3x7lhOyyIiT-O_HsTZlZxw8FrkSA p. 72.]. "(…) to determine the key of a Baroque work one must always analyze its tonal structure rather than rely on the key signature."&lt;/ref&gt; or in transcriptions of traditional modal folk tunes.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, David. ''The Petrie Collection of the Ancient Music of Ireland''. Cork: Cork University Press, 2005. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PzrfncNnr4cC&amp;pg=PA25-IA13&amp;vq=%22In+a+few+cases+Petrie+has+given+what+is+clearly+a+modal+melody+a+key+signature+which+suggests+that+it+is+actally+in+a+minor+key%22&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U0BqVPTuQnnaH32iLpCvrYnyT143Q p. 22]. "In a few cases Petrie has given what is clearly a modal melody a key signature which suggests that it is actually in a minor key. For example, ''Banish Misfortune'' is presented in D minor, although it is clearly in the Dorian mode."&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, this use of a key signature that is theoretically incorrect for a piece as a whole or a self-contained section of a piece became less common (in contrast to brief passages within a piece, which, as they modulate from key to key often temporarily disagree with the key signature); but it can be found at least as late as one of Beethoven's very late piano sonatas.  For example, in his [[Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven)|Sonata No. 31 in A{{music|flat}} major, Op. 110]], the first appearance of the Arioso section in the final movement is notated throughout in six flats; but it both begins and ends in A{{music|flat}} minor and has a significant modulation to C{{music|flat}} major, and both these keys theoretically require seven flats in their key signature.  (The second appearance later in the movement of this same section, a semitone lower, in G minor, uses the correct key signature of two flats.)

== Conventions ==

[[File:ks1.gif|thumb|right|200px|1. [[B major]] scale: no key signature; accidentals required throughout]]
{{anchor|scale2}}[[File:ks2.gif|thumb|right|200px|2. [[B major]] scale: key signature; accidentals not needed]]

In principle, any piece can be written with any key signature, using accidentals to correct the pattern of whole and half steps. The purpose of the key signature is to minimize the number of such accidentals required to notate the music. The sequence of sharps or flats in key signatures is generally rigid in modern [[Music notation#Modern notation|music notation]]. This allows musicians to identify the key simply by the number of sharps or flats (which is the same in any clef), rather than their position on the staff. For example, if a key signature has only one sharp, it must be an [[F♯ (musical note)|F-sharp]],&lt;ref name="orderofsharp"&gt;|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-read-key-signatures.html |title=How to Read Key Signatures|accessdate=29 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to a [[G major]] or an [[E minor]] key.

However, in 20th-century music, there are occasional exceptions to this, where a piece uses an unorthodox or synthetic scale, where a key signature may be invented to reflect this.  This may consist of a number of sharps or flats that are not the normal ones (such as a signature of just C{{music|sharp}} or E{{music|flat}}), or it may consist of one or more sharps combined with one or more flats (such as a signature containing both F{{music|sharp}} and B{{music|flat}}).  Key signatures of this kind can be found in the music of [[Béla Bartók]], for example.

The effect of a key signature continues throughout a piece or movement, unless explicitly cancelled by another key signature. For example, if a five-sharp key signature is placed at the beginning of a piece, every A in the piece in any [[octave]] will be played as A sharp, unless preceded by an accidental (for instance, the A in [[#scale2|scale 2]] illustrated – the next-to-last note – is played as an A{{music|sharp}} even though the A{{music|sharp}} in the key signature (the last sharp sign) is written an octave lower).&lt;ref name="orderofsharp" /&gt;

In a score containing more than one instrument, all the instruments are usually written with the same key signature. Exceptions include:
* If an instrument is a [[transposing instrument]].
* If an instrument is a [[percussion instrument]] with indeterminate pitch.
* Composers usually omit the key signature for [[timpani]] parts. Besides not using a key signature, timpani parts were early on also treated often as transposing instrument parts, the pitch of the high drum being written as C and, as timpani were almost always tuned a [[perfect fourth]] apart (dominant on the low drum and tonic on the high drum), the pitch of the low drum being written as G, with the actual pitches indicated at the beginning of the part, e.g. "timpani in D–A", if they were tuned A (low drum) and D (high drum).
* Composers may omit the key signature for [[French horn|horn]] and occasionally [[trumpet]] parts. This is perhaps reminiscent of the early days of brass instruments, when [[Crook (music)|crooks]] would be added to them, in order to change the length of the tubing and allow playing in different keys.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
* On occasion, in more modern works, instruments may be notated in different keys even when they are not transposing instruments, because the music is [[polytonal]] and the different parts are actually in different keys which sound together.

[[File:Circle of fifths deluxe 4.svg|thumb|right|400px|[[Circle of fifths]] showing [[major key|major]] and [[minor key]]s and their signatures]]

=== Notational conventions ===

The convention for the notation of key signatures follows the [[circle of fifths]]. Starting from [[C major]] (or equivalently [[A minor]]) which has no sharps or flats, successively raising the key by a fifth adds a sharp, going clockwise round the circle of fifths. The new sharp is placed on the new key's [[leading note]] (seventh degree) for major keys or [[supertonic]] (second degree) for minor keys. Thus [[G major]] ([[E minor]]) has one sharp which is on the F; then [[D major]] ([[B minor]]) has two sharps on F and C and so on.

Similarly, successively lowering the key by a fifth adds a flat, going counterclockwise around the circle of fifths. The new flat is placed on the [[subdominant]] (fourth degree) for major keys or [[submediant]] (sixth degree) for minor keys. Thus [[F major]] ([[D minor]]) has one flat which is on the B; then [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]] ([[G minor]]) has two flats (on B and E) and so on.

Put another way: for key signatures with sharps, the first sharp is placed on F with subsequent sharps on C, G, D, A, E and B; for key signatures with flats, the first flat is placed on B with subsequent flats on E, A, D, G, C and F. There are thus 15 conventional key signatures, with up to seven sharps or flats and including the ''empty'' signature of C major (A minor).

Corollaries:

* Starting from a key with flats in its key signature: raising by fifths successively reduces the flats to zero at C major (A minor). Further such raising adds sharps as described above.
* Starting from a key with sharps: lowering by fifths successively reduces those sharps to zero. Further such lowering adds flats as described above.
* When the process of raising by a fifth (adding a sharp) produces more than five or six sharps, successive such raising generally involves changing to the [[enharmonic equivalent]] key using a flat-based signature. Typically this is at F{{music|sharp}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;G{{music|flat}}, but may also be at C{{music|sharp}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;D{{music|flat}} or B&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;C{{music|flat}}. The same principle applies to the process of successive lowering by a fifth.

The relative minor is a [[minor third]] down from the major, regardless of whether it is a ''flat'' or a ''sharp'' key signature.

The key signatures with seven flats ({{Music|flat}}) and seven sharps ({{Music|sharp}}) are rarely used because they have simpler enharmonic equivalents. For example, the key of [[C-sharp major|C{{music|#}} major]] (seven sharps) is more simply represented as [[D-flat major|D{{music|b}} major]] (five flats). For modern practical purposes these keys are (in twelve tone [[equal temperament]]) the same, because C{{music|#}} and D{{music|b}} are enharmonically the same note. Pieces ''are'' written in these ''extreme'' sharp or flat keys, however: for example, [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s Prelude and Fugue No. 3 from Book 1 of [[The Well-Tempered Clavier]] [[List of compositions of Johann Sebastian Bach#The Well-Tempered Clavier .28846.E2.80.93893.29|BWV 848]] is in C{{music|#}} major. The modern musical ''[[Seussical]]'' by [[Stephen Flaherty|Flaherty]] and [[Lynn Ahrens|Ahrens]] also has several songs written in these extreme keys.

Key signatures can be further extended through [[double sharp]]s and [[double flat]]s (for example, a piece in the key of G{{music|#}} major can be expressed with a double sharp on F{{music|x}} and six sharps on the other six pitches). As with the seven-sharp and seven-flat examples, it is rarely necessary to express music in such keys when simpler enharmonic examples can instead be used (in the case of G{{music|#}}, the same passage could be expressed in A{{music|b}} with only four flats).

[[File:Natural key signature example.png|thumb|Natural key signature: a key signature with seven [[Natural (music)|naturals]] ({{Music|natural}}) used to cancel the seven sharps ({{Music|sharp}}) of the previous signature.]]
The key signature may be changed at any time in a piece, usually at the beginning of a [[measure (music)|measure]], simply by notating the new signature, although if the new signature has no sharps or flats, a signature of naturals, as shown, is needed to cancel the preceding signature. If a change in signature occurs at the start of a new line on the page, where a signature would normally appear anyway, the new signature is customarily repeated at the end of the previous line to make the change more conspicuous.

=== Variants of standard conventions ===

In traditional use, when the key signature change goes from sharps to flats or vice versa, the old key signature is cancelled with the appropriate number of naturals before the new one is inserted; but many more recent publications (whether of newer music or newer editions of older music) dispense with the naturals and simply insert the new signature.

Similarly, when a signature with either flats or sharps in it changes to a smaller signature of the same type, strict application of tradition or convention would require that naturals first be used to cancel just those flats or sharps that are being subtracted in the new signature before the new signature itself is written; but, again, more modern usage often dispenses with these naturals.

When the signature changes from a smaller to a larger signature of the same type, the new signature is simply written in by itself, in both traditional and newer styles.

At one time it was usual to precede the new signature with a [[barline|double barline]] (provided the change occurred between bars and not inside a bar), even if it was not required by the structure of the music to mark sections within the movement; but more recently it has increasingly become usual to use just a single barline. The courtesy signature that appears at the end of a line immediately before a change is usually preceded by an additional barline; the line at the very end of the staff is omitted in this case.

If both naturals and a new key signature appear at a key signature change, there are also more recently variations about where a barline will be placed (in the case where the change occurs between bars). For example, in some scores by Debussy, in this situation the barline is placed after the naturals but before the new key signature. Hitherto, it would have been more usual to place all the symbols after the barline.

In key signatures of five or more sharps or of seven flats, one occasionally encounters variant positions of particular symbols in the key signatures, both of them in the bass clef.

The A{{music|sharp}} which is the fifth sharp in the sharp signatures may occasionally be notated on the top line of the bass staff, whereas it is more usually found in the lowest space on that staff. An example of this can be seen in the full score of [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s ''[[Pines of Rome]]'', in the third section, "Pines of the Janiculum" (which is in [[B major]]), in the bass-clef instrumental parts.

In the case of seven-flat key signatures, the final F{{music|flat}} may occasionally be seen on the second-top line of the bass staff, whereas it would more usually appear below the bottom line. An example of this can be seen in [[Isaac Albéniz]]'s ''[[Iberia (Albéniz)|Iberia]]'': first movement, "Evocación", which is in [[A-flat minor|A{{music|flat}}]] minor.

==Major scale structure==
Except for C major, key signatures appear in two varieties, "sharp key signatures" ("sharp keys") and "flat key signatures" ("flat keys"), so called because they contain only one or other.&lt;ref name="Schonbrun"&gt;Schonbrun, Marc (2005). ''The Everything Music Theory Book'', p.68. {{ISBN|1-59337-652-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scales with sharp key signatures===

Sharp key signatures consist of a number of sharps between one and seven, applied in this order: {{nowrap|F C G D A E B}}.&lt;ref name="Bower"&gt;Bower, Michael. 2007.

"Key-Signature". ''Oxford Dictionary of Music'', second edition, associate editor, Joyce Bourne. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-869162-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one sharp (F{{music|sharp}}) in the key signature of a piece in a major key indicates the key of G major, the next note above F{{music|sharp}}. (Six sharps, the last one being E{{music|sharp}} (an [[enharmonic]] spelling of F{{music|natural}}) indicate the key of F{{music|sharp}} major, since F has already been sharped in the key signature.)

This table shows that each scale starting on the [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] [[scale degree]] of the previous scale has one new sharp, added in the order given above.&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt;

===Scales with flat key signatures===
"Flat key signatures" consist of one to seven flats, applied as: {{nowrap|B E A D G C F}}&lt;ref name="Bower"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; The mnemonic device is then reversed for use in the flat keys: "Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles' Father".&lt;ref name="Schonbrun"/&gt; The major scale with one flat is F major.

In this case each new scale starts a fifth ''below'' (or a [[Perfect fourth|fourth]] above) the previous one.

== Relationship between ''key signature'' and ''key'' ==

A key signature is not the same as a [[key (music)|key]]; key signatures are merely notational devices. They are convenient principally for [[diatonic]] or [[tonality|tonal]] music.

The key signature defines the [[diatonic scale]] that a piece of music uses without the need for accidentals. Most [[scale (music)|scales]] require that some notes be consistently sharped or flatted. For example, the only sharp in the G [[major scale]] is F sharp, so the key signature associated with the G major key is the one-sharp key signature. However, it is only a notational convenience; a piece with a one-sharp key signature is not necessarily in the key of G major, and likewise, a piece in G major may not always be written with a one-sharp key signature; this is particularly true in pre-Baroque music, when the concept of key had not yet evolved to its present state.

In any case, more extensive pieces often change key (''[[modulation (music)|modulate]]'') during contrasting sections, and only sometimes is this change indicated with a change of key signature; if not, the passage in the second key will not have a matching key signature.

[[File:GottesZeit.png|400px|thumb|right|[[Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, BWV 106|Bach Cantata 106]] is almost entirely in E{{music|flat}} major, but has only two flats, not three, in the key signature {{audio|GottesZeit.mid|Play}}]]

The [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 538]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] has no key signature, leading it to be called the ''[[Dorian mode|Dorian]]'', but it is still in D minor; the B{{music|flat}}s that occur in the piece are written with accidentals.

===Additional terminology===
Keys which are associated with the same key signature are called [[relative minor/major|relative keys]].

When [[musical mode]]s, such as [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] or Dorian, are written using key signatures, they are called ''transposed modes''.

== Exceptions ==&lt;!--[[Unusual key signature]] redirects directly here.--&gt;

[[File:D Freygish Noteworthy Composer.png|thumb|D [[Phrygian dominant scale|Freygish]] scale {{audio|D Freygish.mid|Play}}]]

Exceptions to [[Common practice period|common-practice-period]] use may be found in [[Klezmer]] scales, such as [[Phrygian dominant scale|Freygish (Phrygian)]]. In the 20th century, composers such as [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] and [[Frederic Rzewski|Rzewski]] (see below) began experimenting with unusual key signatures that departed from the [[musical mode|standard order]].

Because of the limitations of the traditional [[Great Highland Bagpipe|highland bagpipe]] scale, key signatures are often omitted from written pipe music, which otherwise would be written with two sharps, the usual 
F{{music|#}} and C{{music|#}}.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Unusual signatures ===
{{further information|Anhemitonic scale#Modes of the ancohemitonic heptatonic scales and the key signature system}}

The above 15 key signatures only express diatonic scale. and are therefore sometimes called ''standard key signatures''. Other scales are written either with a standard key signature and use accidental as required, or with a nonstandard key signature. Examples of the latter include the E{{music|b}} (right hand), and F{{music|b}} and G{{music|b}} (left hand) used for the E{{music|b}} diminished (E{{music|b}} [[octatonic scale|octatonic]]) scale in Bartók's ''Crossed Hands'' (no. 99, vol. 4, ''[[Mikrokosmos (Béla Bartók)|Mikrokosmos]]''), or the B{{music|b}}, E{{music|b}} and F{{music|#}}&lt;!--yes, sharp--&gt; used for the D [[Phrygian dominant scale]] in [[Frederic Rzewski]]'s ''God to a Hungry Child''.

The absence of a key signature does not always mean that the music is in the key of C major&amp;nbsp;/ A minor as each accidental may be notated explicitly as required, or the piece may be [[Musical mode|modal]] or [[atonality|atonal]]. An example is Bartók's [[Piano Sonata (Bartók)|Piano Sonata]], which has no fixed key and is highly chromatic.

If not bound by common practice conventions, [[microtonal music|microtones]] can also be notated in a key signature; which [[List of musical symbols#Quarter tones|microtonal symbols]] are used depends on the system.

The [[common practice period]] conventions are so firmly established that some [[scorewriter|musical notation programs]] have been unable to show nonstandard key signatures until recently.&lt;ref&gt;One of the most popular musical notation programs, Finale, has only included the option to create a nonstandard key signature since their 2009 version: Finale 2009 User Manual for Windows. "Non-Standard Key Signature." http://www.finalemusic.com/UserManuals/Finale2009Win/Finale.htm (accessed February 17, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The use of a one-flat signature developed in the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] period, but signatures with more than one flat did not appear until the 16th century, and signatures with sharps not until the mid-17th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Key Signature", ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

When signatures with multiple flats first came in, the order of the flats was not standardized, and often a flat appeared in two different octaves, as shown at right. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, it was common for different voice parts in the same composition to have different signatures, a situation called a '''partial signature''' or '''conflicting signature'''. This was actually more common than complete signatures in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Partial Signature", ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt; The 16th-century motet ''Absolon fili mi'' attributed to [[Josquin des Prez]] features two voice parts with two flats, one part with three flats, and one part with four flats.

Baroque music written in [[minor key]]s often was written with a key signature with fewer flats than we now associate with their keys; for example, movements in C minor often had only two flats (because the A{{music|flat}} would frequently have to be sharpened to A{{music|natural}} in the [[minor scale|ascending melodic minor scale]], as would the B{{music|flat}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8929">A '''lighting control system''' is an intelligent network based lighting control solution that incorporates communication between various system inputs and outputs related to lighting control with the use of one or more central computing devices.  Lighting control systems are widely used on  both indoor and outdoor lighting of commercial, industrial, and residential spaces. Lighting control systems serve to provide the right amount of light where and when it is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DiLouie|first=Craig|title=Lighting controls handbook|year=2008|publisher=Fairmont Press [u.a.]|location=Lilburn, Ga. [u.a.]|isbn=1-4200-6921-7|pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lighting control systems are employed to maximize the [[energy conservation|energy savings]] from the lighting system, satisfy [[building codes]], or comply with [[green building]] and [[energy conservation]] programs.  Lighting control systems are often referred to under the term [[Smart Lighting]].

== Lighting controls==
The term ''lighting controls'' is typically used to indicate stand-alone control of the lighting within a space. This may include [[occupancy sensor]]s, timeclocks, and [[photocells]] that are hard-wired to control fixed groups of lights independently. Adjustment occurs manually at each devices location. The efficiency of and market for residential lighting controls has been characterized by the [[Consortium for Energy Efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEE Residential Lighting Controls Market Characterization|url=http://library.cee1.org/content/cee-residential-lighting-controls-market-characterization|publisher=[[Consortium for Energy Efficiency]]|accessdate=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''lighting control system'' refers to an intelligent networked system of devices related to lighting control. These devices may include [[relay]]s, [[occupancy sensor]]s, [[photocells]], light control switches or [[touchscreens]], and signals from other building systems (such as [[fire alarm]] or [[HVAC]]). Adjustment of the system occurs both at device locations and at central computer locations via software programs or other interface devices.

===Advantages===
The major advantage of a lighting control system over stand-alone lighting controls or conventional manual [[light switch|switch]]ing is the ability to control individual lights or groups of lights from a single [[user interface]] device.  This ability to control multiple light sources from a user device allows complex lighting scenes to be created. A room may have multiple scenes pre-set, each one created for different activities in the room.  A major benefit of lighting control systems is reduced energy consumption. Longer lamp life is also gained when dimming and switching off lights when not in use. Wireless lighting control systems provide additional benefits including reduced installation costs and increased flexibility over where switches and sensors may be placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lighting control saves money and makes sense|url=http://www.daintree.net/downloads/whitepapers/smart-lighting.pdf|publisher=[[Daintree Networks]]|accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automated control==
Lighting control systems typically provide the ability to automatically adjust a lighting device's output based on:
*Chronological time (time of day)
*Solar time ([[sunrise]]/[[sunset]])
*[[Occupancy]] using [[occupancy sensor]]s
*[[Daylight]] availability using [[photocell]]s
*[[Alarm]] conditions
*Program logic (combination of events)

===Chronological time===
Chronological time schedules incorporate specific times of the day, week, month or year.

===Solar time===
Solar time schedules incorporate [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]] times, often used to switch outdoor lighting. Solar time scheduling requires that the location of the building be set. This is accomplished using the building's geographic location via either latitude and longitude or by picking the nearest city in a given database giving the approximate location and corresponding solar times.

===Occupancy===
Space occupancy is primarily determined with [[occupancy sensor]]s.

===Daylight availability===
Electric lighting energy use can be adjusted by automatically dimming and/or switching electric lights in response to the level of available [[daylighting|daylight]].  Reducing the amount of electric lighting used when daylight is available is known as [[daylight harvesting]].

===Alarm conditions===
Alarm conditions typically include inputs from other building systems  such as the [[fire alarm]] or [[HVAC]] system, which may trigger an emergency 'all lights on' or ' all lights flashing' command for example.

===Program logic===
Program logic can tie all of the above elements together using constructs such as [[if-then-else]] statements and [[logical operator]]s.

==Types==
In the 1980s there was a strong requirement to make commercial lighting more controllable so that it could become more energy efficient. Initially this was done with analog control, allowing [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] [[Electrical ballast|ballasts]] and [[dimmer]]s to be controlled from a central source. This was a step in the right direction, but cabling was complicated and therefore not cost effective.  

Tridonic was an early company to go digital with their broadcast [[communications protocol|protocol]]s, [[Digital Serial Interface|DSI]], in 1991. [[Digital Serial Interface|DSI]] was a basic protocol as it transmitted one control value to change the brightness of all the fixtures attached to the line. What made this protocol more attractive, and able to compete with the established analog option, was the simple wiring.

There are two types of lighting control systems which are:
* [[Analog electronics|Analog]] lighting control
* [[Digital electronics|Digital]] lighting control

Examples for analog lighting control systems are:
* [[0-10 V lighting control|0-10V]] based system.
* [[AMX192]] based systems (often referred to as AMX) ([[United States|USA]] standard).
* [[D54 (protocol)|D54]] based systems (European standard).

In production lighting 0-10V system was replaced by analog multiplexed systems such as D54 and AMX192, which themselves have been almost completely replaced by DMX512. For dimmable fluorescent lamps (where it operates instead at 1-10 V, where 1 V is minimum and 0 V is off) the system is being replaced by DSI, which itself is in the process of being replaced by DALI.

Examples for digital lighting control systems are:
* [[Digital Addressable Lighting Interface|DALI]] based systems 
* [[Digital Serial Interface|DSI]] based system 
* [[DMX512]] based systems (often referred to as simply DMX).
* [[KNX (standard)|KNX]] based systems

Those are all wired lighting control system. There is also a [[wireless]] lighting control system that is based on some standard protocols like [[MIDI]], [[ZigBee]], [[Bluetooth Mesh]], and others.

==Theatrical lighting control==
{{Main|Stage lighting}}
Architectural lighting control systems can integrate with a  [[Theater (structure)|theater]]'s on-off and [[dimmer]] controls, and are often used for [[house lights]] and [[stage lighting]], and can include [[worklight]]s, [[rehearsal]] lighting, and [[Lobby (room)|lobby]] lighting.  Control stations can be placed in several locations in the building and range in complexity from single buttons that bring up preset options-looks, to in-wall or desktop [[LCD]] [[touchscreen]] consoles. Much of the [[technology]] is related to residential and commercial lighting control systems.

The benefit of architectural lighting control systems in the theater is the ability for theater staff to turn worklights and house lights on and off without having to use a [[lighting control console]].  Alternately, the light designer can control these same lights with light [[cue (theatrical)|cues]] from the lighting control console so that, for instance, the transition from houselights being up before a show starts and the first light cue of the show is controlled by one system.

'''Lightwood's law''' is the principle that, in [[medicine]], [[bacterial]] infections will tend to localise while [[Virus|viral]] infections will tend to spread.&lt;ref name="GillO'Brien2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Denis Gill|author2=Niall O'Brien|title=Paediatric Clinical Examination Made Easy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQVODgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246|date=9 March 2017|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-7020-7290-1|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the observation that while bacterial [[sepsis]] tends, despite affecting the whole body, to have a clear site of origin or 'focus', the opposite may be true of viral infections.&lt;ref name="Stephenson2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terence Stephenson|title=Swine Flu: What Parents Need to Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V1cSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48|year=2009|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-84905-085-2|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be multiple sites across the body which are affected including [[dermatological]] manifestations, [[respiratory]] symptoms and [[gastrointestinal]] symptoms. 

This principle is by no means infallible and in clinical practice a variety of diagnostic tests are used to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections.

A '''nutrient''' is a [[Chemical substance|substance]] used by an organism to survive, grow, and reproduce. The requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s. Nutrients can be incorporated into cells for [[metabolism|metabolic purposes]] or [[excretion|excreted]] by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as [[hair]], [[scale (anatomy)|scales]], [[feather]]s, or [[exoskeleton]]s. Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy, such as for [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and [[fermentation]] products ([[ethanol]] or [[vinegar]]), leading to end-products of water and [[carbon dioxide]]. All organisms require water. Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the [[amino acid]]s that are combined to create [[protein]]s, a subset of [[fatty acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s and certain [[mineral (nutrient)|minerals]]. Plants require more diverse minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed through leaves. [[fungus|Fungi]] live on dead or living organic matter and meet nutrient needs from their host.

Different types of organism have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid ([[vitamin C]]) is essential, meaning it must be consumed in sufficient amounts, to humans and some other animal species, but not to all animals and not to plants, which are able to synthesize it. Nutrients may be [[organic compound|organic]] or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as [[iron]], [[selenium]], and [[zinc]], while organic nutrients include, among many others, energy-providing compounds and vitamins.

A classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] and [[micronutrient]]s. Consumed in relatively large amounts ([[gram]]s or [[ounce]]s), macronutrients ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, proteins, water) are used primarily to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for growth and repair. Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts ([[milligram]]s or [[microgram]]s); they have subtle [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[physiology|physiological]] roles in cellular processes, like [[vascular smooth muscle|vascular functions]] or [[action potential|nerve conduction]]. Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients, or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a deficiency state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction. Consumer advisories for dietary nutrient intakes, such as the United States [[Dietary Reference Intake]], are based on deficiency outcomes{{clarify|date=January 2018}} and provide macronutrient and micronutrient guides for both lower and [[Tolerable upper intake levels|upper limits]] of intake. In many countries, macronutrients and micronutrients in significant content{{clarify|date=January 2018}} are required by regulations to be displayed on food product labels. Nutrients in larger quantities than the body needs may have harmful effects.&lt;ref name="Ensminger1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Audrey H. Ensminger|title=Foods &amp; nutrition encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XMA9gYIj-C4C&amp;pg=PA527|accessdate=12 October 2010|year=1994|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-8980-1|pages=527–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edible plants also contain thousands of compounds generally called [[phytochemical]]s which have unknown effects on disease or health, including a diverse class with non-nutrient status called [[polyphenol]]s, which remain poorly understood as of 2017.

Plant nutrients consist of more than a dozen minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed or released through leaves. All organisms obtain all their nutrients from the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=WhitneyRolfes2005&gt;Whitney, Elanor and Sharon Rolfes. 2005. ''Understanding Nutrition, 10th edition'', p. 6.

==Plant nutrition==
{{main|Plant nutrition|Fertilizer}}
Plants absorb carbon, hydrogen and oxygen from air. These three, in the form of water and [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Jones1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Benton Jones|title=Plant nutrition manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNP2exwYMJIC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=14 October 2010|year=1998|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-884015-31-1|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nutrients are absorbed from soil (exceptions include some parasitic or carnivorous plants). Counting these, there are 17 important nutrients for plants:&lt;ref name="BarkerPilbeam2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Allen V. Barker|author2=D. J. Pilbeam|title=Handbook of plant nutrition|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=ZWjLBQAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions|accessdate=17 August 2010|year=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-5904-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the macronutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), magnesium (Mg), carbon (C), oxygen(O) and hydrogen (H), and the micronutrients iron (Fe), boron (B), chlorine (Cl), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo) and nickel (Ni). In addition to carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulfur]] are also needed in relatively large quantities. Together, the "Big Six" are the elemental '''macronutrients''' for all [[biological life|organisms]].&lt;ref name=wsj20101203&gt;
[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703377504575650840897300342?mod=ITP_pageone_1#printMode New Link in Chain of Life], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 2010-12-03, accessed 2010-12-05. "Until now, however, they were all thought to share the same biochemistry, based on the Big Six, to build proteins, fats and DNA."&lt;/ref&gt;
They are sourced from inorganic matter (for example, [[carbon dioxide]], [[water]], [[nitrate]]s, [[phosphate]]s, [[sulfate]]s, and [[diatomic molecule]]s of nitrogen and, especially, oxygen) and organic matter ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s).

==Types of nutrients==
{{main|Nutrition}}

===Macronutrients===
Macronutrients are defined in several ways.&lt;ref name="Kern2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Kern|title=CRC desk reference on sports  nutrition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOYqeeXWomwC&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=12 October 2010|date=12 May 2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-2273-0|pages=117–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[chemical element]]s humans consume in the largest quantities are [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulphur]], summarized as [[CHNOPS]].
* The chemical compounds that humans consume in the largest quantities and provide bulk energy are classified as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[fat]]s. Water must be also consumed in large quantities.
* [[Calcium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], and [[chloride]] ions, along with phosphorus and sulfur, are listed with [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] because they are required in large quantities compared to [[micronutrient]]s, i.e., vitamins and other minerals, the latter often described as trace or ultratrace minerals.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Macronutrients provide energy:

* [[Carbohydrate]]s are compounds made up of types of [[sugar]]. Carbohydrates are classified according to their number of sugar units: [[monosaccharide]]s (such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]), [[disaccharide]]s (such as [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]), [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s (such as [[starch]], [[glycogen]], and [[cellulose]]).
* [[Protein]]s are [[organic compound]]s that consist of [[amino acid]]s joined by [[peptide bond]]s. Since the body cannot manufacture some of the [[amino acid]]s (termed [[essential amino acid]]s), the diet must supply them. Through digestion, [[protein]]s are [[protein catabolism|broken down]] by [[protease]]s back into free amino acids.
* [[Fat]]s consist of a [[glycerin]] molecule with three [[fatty acid]]s attached. Fatty acid molecules contain a -COOH group attached to unbranched [[hydrocarbon]] chains connected by single bonds alone ([[Saturated fat|saturated fatty acids]]) or by both double and single bonds ([[Unsaturated fat|unsaturated fatty acids]]). Fats are needed for construction and maintenance of [[cell membrane]]s, to maintain a stable body temperature, and to sustain the health of skin and hair. Because the body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed [[essential fatty acid]]s), they must be obtained through one's diet.

Fat has an [[energy]] content of 9{{nbsp}}[[kcal]]/g (~37.7 kJ/g) and proteins and carbohydrates 4{{nbsp}}kcal/g (~16.7 kJ/g).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Micronutrients===
Micronutrients support metabolism.

* [[Dietary mineral]]s are generally trace elements, salts, or ions such as copper and iron. Some of these minerals are essential to human metabolism.
* [[Vitamin]]s are organic compounds essential to the body. They usually act as [[coenzyme]]s or [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for various proteins in the body.

An '''essential nutrient''' is a nutrient required for normal physiological function that cannot be synthesized in the body&amp;nbsp;– either at all or in sufficient quantities&amp;nbsp;– and thus must be obtained from a [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://library.med.utah.edu/NetBiochem/nutrition/lect1/2_1.html | title = What is an essential nutrient? | publisher = NetBiochem Nutrition, [[University of Utah]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VaughanGeissler2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Griffith Vaughan|author2=Catherine Geissler|author3=Barbara Nicholson |author4=Elisabeth Dowle |author5=Elizabeth Rice|title=The new Oxford book of food plants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdKxFcen8zgC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=13 October 2010|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-954946-7|pages=212–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[water]], which is universally required for the maintenance of [[homeostasis]] in mammals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jéquier|first1=E|last2=Constant|first2=F|title=Water as an essential nutrient: the physiological basis of hydration|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=2 September 2009|volume=64|issue=2|pages=115–123|doi=10.1038/ejcn.2009.111|url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v64/n2/pdf/ejcn2009111a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; essential nutrients are indispensable for various cellular [[metabolic process]]es and maintaining tissue and organ function.&lt;ref name="AJCN"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chipponi|first1=JX|last2=Bleier|first2=JC|last3=Santi|first3=MT|last4=Rudman|first4=D|title=Deficiencies of essential and conditionally essential nutrients.|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=May 1982|volume=35|issue=5 Suppl|pages=1112–1116|pmid=6805293|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/35/5/1112.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of humans, there are nine [[amino acid]]s, two [[fatty acid]]s, thirteen [[vitamin]]s and fifteen [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]] that are considered essential nutrients.&lt;ref name="AJCN" /&gt; In addition, there are several molecules that are considered conditionally essential nutrients since they are indispensable in certain developmental and pathological states.&lt;ref name="AJCN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carver"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carver|first1=Jane|title=Neonatal Nutrition and Metabolism|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=299–311|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511544712.020|chapter=Conditionally essential nutrients: choline, inositol, taurine, arginine, glutamine and nucleotides}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kendler|first1=BS|title=Supplemental conditionally essential nutrients in cardiovascular disease therapy|journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing|date=2006|volume=21|issue=1|pages=9–16|pmid=16407731|doi=10.1097/00005082-200601000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amino acids====
{{Main|Essential amino acid}}
An essential amino acid is an [[amino acid]] that is required by an organism but cannot be synthesized ''[[de novo synthesis|de novo]]'' by it, and therefore must be supplied in its diet. Out of the twenty standard protein-producing amino acids, nine cannot be [[endogenous]]ly synthesized by humans: [[phenylalanine]], [[valine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], [[methionine]], [[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], [[lysine]], and [[histidine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Young VR |title=Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations |journal=J. Nutr. |volume=124 |issue=8 Suppl |pages=1517S–1523S |year=1994 |pmid=8064412 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/124/8_Suppl/1517S.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DRI"&gt;Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Guide to Nutrient Requirements, published by the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board, currently available online at {{cite web |url=http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dietary-reference-intakes/dri-reports |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705140516/http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dietary-reference-intakes/dri-reports |archivedate=2014-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fatty acids====
{{Main|Essential fatty acid}}
Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are [[fatty acid]]s that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but cannot [[Biosynthesis|synthesize]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | edition = 6th | year = 1980 |author1=Robert S. Goodhart |author2=Maurice E. Shils | publisher = Lea and Febinger | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 0-8121-0645-8 | pages = 134–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two fatty acids are known to be essential for humans: [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (an [[omega-3 fatty acid]]) and [[linoleic acid]] (an [[omega-6 fatty acid]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Whitney Ellie |author2=Rolfes SR | title = Understanding Nutrition | edition = 11th | location = California | publisher = Thomson Wadsworth | year = 2008 | pages = 154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vitamins====
{{Main|Vitamin}}
Vitamins are organic molecules essential for an organism that are not classified as [[amino acid]]s or [[fatty acid]]s. They commonly function as [[enzymatic cofactor]]s, metabolic regulators or [[antioxidant]]s. Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, most of which are actually groups of related molecules (e.g. [[vitamin E]] includes [[tocopherol]]s and [[tocotrienol]]s):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brigelius-Flohé R, Traber MG | title = Vitamin E: function and metabolism | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 1145–1155 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10385606 | last2 = Traber | doi=10.1096/fasebj.13.10.1145}}&lt;/ref&gt; vitamins A, C, D, E, K, [[thiamine]] (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), [[riboflavin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[niacin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pantothenic acid]] (B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] (e.g., [[pyridoxine]]), [[biotin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;), [[folate]] (B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[cobalamin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). The requirement for vitamin D is conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin.

====Minerals====
{{Main|Mineral (nutrient)}}
Minerals are the [[exogenous]] [[chemical element]]s indispensable for life. Although the four elements: [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]], are essential for life, they are so plentiful in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. [[Sulfur]] is essential, but again does not have a recommended intake. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.

The essential nutrient elements for humans, listed in order of [[Reference Daily Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (expressed as a mass), are [[potassium]], [[chlorine]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[iodine]], [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[cobalt]] (the last as a component of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals, but may or may not be essential for humans, such as [[boron]] and [[silicon]].

===Conditionally essential nutrients===
Conditionally essential nutrients are certain organic molecules that can normally be synthesized by an organism, but under certain conditions in insufficient quantities. In humans, such conditions include [[Preterm birth|premature birth]], limited nutrient intake, rapid growth, and certain disease states.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt; [[Choline]], [[inositol]], [[taurine]], [[arginine]], [[glutamine]] and [[nucleotides]] are classified as conditionally essential and are particularly important in neonatal diet and metabolism.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;

=== Non-essential nutrients ===
Non-essential nutrients are substances within foods that can have a significant impact on health; these substances can be beneficial or toxic.{{mcn|date=January 2018}} For example, [[dietary fiber]] is not absorbed in the human digestive tract, but is important in maintaining the bulk of a [[bowel movement]] to avoid [[constipation]].{{mcn|date=January 2018}} A subset of dietary fiber, [[soluble fiber]], can be metabolized by bacteria residing in the large intestine.&lt;ref name="Butyrate synthesis pathways" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lupton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prebiotic digestion" /&gt; Soluble fiber is marketed as serving a [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] function{{snd}}promoting "healthy" intestinal bacteria.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Bacterial metabolism of soluble fiber also produces [[short-chain fatty acid]]s like [[butyric acid]], which may be absorbed into intestinal cells as a source of calories.&lt;ref name="Butyrate synthesis pathways"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vital M, Howe AC, Tiedje JM | title = Revealing the bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways by analyzing (meta)genomic data | journal = mBio | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = e00889 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24757212 | pmc = 3994512 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.00889-14 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lupton"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lupton JR | title = Microbial degradation products influence colon cancer risk: the butyrate controversy | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 2 | pages = 479–482 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14747692 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/134/2/479 | doi=10.1093/jn/134.2.479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prebiotic digestion"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cummings JH, Macfarlane GT, Englyst HN | title = Prebiotic digestion and fermentation | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 73 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 415S-420S | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11157351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-nutrients===
[[Ethanol]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH) supplies calories. For spirits (vodka, gin, rum, etc.) a standard serving in the United States is {{convert|1.5|USfloz|ml}}, which at 40%{{nbsp}}ethanol (80{{nbsp}}proof) would be 14 grams and 98 calories. At 50%{{nbsp}}alcohol, 17.5{{nbsp}}grams and 122.5{{nbsp}}calories. Wine and beer contain a similar amount of ethanol in servings of {{convert|5|USfloz|ml}} and {{convert|12|USfloz|ml}}, respectively, but these beverages also contain non-ethanol calories. A 5-ounce serving of wine contains 100 to 130 calories. A 12-ounce serving of beer contains 95 to 200 calories.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, based on [[NHANES]] 2013–2014 surveys, women ages 20 and up consume on average 6.8{{nbsp}}grams of alcohol per day and men consume on average 15.5 grams per day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf "What We Eat in America, NHANES 2013-2014"]&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring the non-alcohol contribution of those beverages, the average ethanol calorie contributions are 48 and 108 cal/day, respectively.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Alcoholic beverages are considered [[empty calorie]] foods because, other than calories, they contribute no essential nutrients.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

By definition, [[phytochemical]]s include all nutritional and non-nutritional components of edible plants.&lt;ref name="lpi1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phytochemicals|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included as nutritional constituents are [[provitamin]] A [[carotenoid]]s,&lt;ref name="lpi2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carotenoids|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas those without nutrient status are diverse [[polyphenol]]s, [[flavonoid]]s, [[resveratrol]], and [[lignan]]s &amp;ndash; often claimed to have [[antioxidant]] effects &amp;ndash; that are present in numerous plant foods.&lt;ref name="lpi3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flavonoids|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of phytochemical compounds are under preliminary research for their potential effects on human diseases and health.&lt;ref name="lpi1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lpi2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=lpi3/&gt; However, the qualification for nutrient status of compounds with poorly defined properties ''[[in vivo]]'' is that they must first be defined with a [[Dietary Reference Intake]] level to enable accurate food labeling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrient content claims--general principles; 21CFR101.13|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.13|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a condition not established for most phytochemicals that are claimed to be antioxidant nutrients.&lt;ref name="nutra"&gt;{{cite web |title= New Roles for Polyphenols.

==Deficiencies and toxicity==
''See [[Vitamin]], [[Mineral (nutrient)]], [[Protein (nutrient)]]''

An inadequate amount of a nutrient is a deficiency. Deficiencies can be due to a number of causes including an inadequacy in nutrient intake, called a dietary deficiency, or any of several conditions that interfere with the utilization of a nutrient within an organism.&lt;ref name="Ensminger1994"/&gt; Some of the conditions that can interfere with nutrient utilization include problems with nutrient absorption, substances that cause a greater than normal need for a nutrient, conditions that cause nutrient destruction, and conditions that cause greater nutrient excretion.&lt;ref name="Ensminger1994"/&gt; Nutrient toxicity occurs when excess consumption of a nutrient does harm to an organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Nutrient Toxicity|journal=Nutrition Reviews|volume=39|issue=6|pages=249–256|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.1981.tb07453.x|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Canada, recommended dietary intake levels of essential nutrients are based on the minimum level that "will maintain a defined level of nutriture in an individual", a definition somewhat different from that used by the [[World Health Organization]] and [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of a "basal requirement to indicate the level of intake needed to prevent pathologically relevant and clinically detectable signs of a dietary inadequacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Dietary Reference Intakes. What are dietary reference intakes?

In setting human nutrient guidelines, government organizations do not necessarily agree on amounts needed to avoid deficiency or maximum amounts to avoid the risk of toxicity.&lt;ref name=DRITable&gt;[http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRI-Tables/5Summary%20TableTables%2014.pdf?la=en Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)] Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, National Academies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JapanDRI&gt;[http://www.nibiohn.go.jp/eiken/info/pdf/dris2010en.pdf Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese (2010)] National Institute of Health and Nutrition, Japan&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for [[vitamin C]], recommended intakes range from 40&amp;nbsp;mg/day in India&lt;ref name="NIN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icmr.nic.in/final/rda-2010.pdf |title=Nutrient Requirements and Recommended Dietary Allowances for Indians: A Report of the Expert Group of the Indian Council of Medical Research. pp.283-295 (2009) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615094048/http://icmr.nic.in/final/RDA-2010.pdf |archivedate=June 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 155&amp;nbsp;mg/day for the European Union.&lt;ref name=EFSA-Recommended&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies |year=2017 |url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828082247/https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf |archivedate=August 28, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below shows U.S. Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals, PRIs for the European Union (same concept as RDAs), followed by what three government organizations deem to be the safe upper intake. RDAs are set higher than EARs to cover people with higher than average needs. Adequate Intakes (AIs) are set when there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs. Governments are slow to revise information of this nature. For the U.S. values, with the exception of calcium and vitamin D, all of the data date to 1997-2004.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt;

*For niacin and magnesium there appears to be a contradiction inherent in the information in the table, as the amounts recommended for daily consumption can be more than the amounts identified as the safe upper limits. For both nutrients, the ULs identify the amounts which will not increase risk of adverse effects when the nutrients are consumed as a serving of a dietary supplement. Magnesium above the UL may cause diarrhea. Niacin above the UL may cause flushing of the face and a sensation of body warmth. Each country or regional regulatory agency decides on a safety margin below when symptoms may occur, so the ULs can differ.&lt;ref name=DRITable /&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA /&gt;

'''EAR''' U.S. Estimated Average Requirements.

'''RDA''' U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances; higher for adults than for children, and may be even higher for women who are pregnant or lactating.

'''AI'''  U.S. Adequate Intake; AIs established when there is not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs.

'''PRI''' Population Reference Intake is European Union equivalent of RDA; higher for adults than for children, and may be even higher for women who are pregnant or lactating. For Thiamin and Niacin the PRIs are expressed as amounts per MJ of calories consumed. MJ = megajoule = 239 food calories.

'''Upper Limit'''  Tolerable upper intake levels.

'''ND'''  ULs have not been determined.

'''NE'''  EARs, PRIs or AIs have not yet been established or will not be (EU does not consider chromium an essential nutrient).

In [[programming language theory]], the '''POPLmark challenge''' (from "Principles of Programming Languages benchmark", formerly '''Mechanized Metatheory for the Masses!''') (Aydemir, 2005) is a set of [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]] designed to evaluate the state of [[automated reasoning]] (or mechanization) in the [[metatheory]] of programming languages, and to stimulate discussion and collaboration among a diverse cross section of the [[formal methods]] community. Very loosely speaking, the challenge is about measurement of how well programs may be proven to match a specification of how they are intended to behave (and the many complex issues that this involves). The challenge was initially proposed by the members of the ''PL club'' at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], in association with collaborators around the world. The ''Workshop on Mechanized Metatheory'' is the main meeting of researchers participating in the challenge.

The design of the POPLmark benchmark is guided by features common to reasoning about programming languages. The challenge problems do not require the formalisation of large programming languages, but they do require sophistication in reasoning about:

; [[Name binding|Binding]] : Most programming languages have some form of binding, ranging in complexity from the simple binders of [[simply typed lambda calculus]] to complex, potentially infinite binders needed in the treatment of [[record (computer science)|record]] [[pattern matching|pattern]]s.
; [[Mathematical induction|Induction]] : Properties such as [[subject reduction]] and [[strong normalisation]] often require complex induction arguments.
; Reuse : Furthering collaboration being a key aim of the challenge, the solutions are expected to contain reusable components that would allow researchers to share language features and designs without requiring them to start from scratch every time.

== The problems ==

{{As of|2007}}, the POPLmark challenge is composed of three parts. Part 1 concerns solely the types of [[system F-sub|System F&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;]] ([[System F]] with [[subtyping]]), and has problems such as:
# Checking that the type system admits [[transitive relation|transitivity]] of subtyping.
# Checking the transitivity of subtyping in the presence of [[record (computer science)|record]]s

Part 2 concerns the syntax and semantics of System F&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;. It concerns proofs of
# [[Type safety]] for the pure fragment
# Type safety in the presence of [[pattern matching]]

Part 3 concerns the usability of the formalisation of System F&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, the challenge asks for:
# Simulating and animating the [[operational semantics]]
# Extracting useful algorithms from the formalisations

Several solutions have been proposed for parts of the POPLmark challenge, using following tools: [[Isabelle theorem prover|Isabelle/HOL]], [[Twelf]], [[Coq]], [http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jcheney/programs/aprolog/ αProlog], [[ATS (programming language)|ATS]], [http://abella.cs.umn.edu/ Abella] and [[Matita proof assistant|Matita]].

A '''plant genome assembly''' represents the complete [[genome|genomic sequence]] of a [[plant]] species, which is assembled into [[chromosome]]s and other [[organelle]]s by using [[DNA]] (deoxyribonucleic acid) fragments that are obtained from different types of [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] technology.

Clone-by-clone sequencing strategies are based on the construction of a [[Gene map|map]] for each chromosome before the sequencing, and rely on libraries made from large-insert clones. The most common type of large-insert clone is the [[bacterial artificial chromosome]] (BAC).

With BAC, the genome is first split into smaller pieces with the location recorded. The pieces of DNA are then inserted into BAC clones that are further multiplied by inserting them into bacterial cells that grow very fast. These pieces are further fragmented into overlapping smaller pieces that are placed into a vector and then sequenced. The small pieces are then assembled into contigs by overlapping them. Next, using the map from the first step the contigs are assembled back into the chromosomes.

The first complete plant genome assembly (also the first plant genome published) that used this type of technique was Arabidopsis thaliana,in 2000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Different large-insert libraries like BACs, [[P1 artificial chromosomes]] (PAC), [[yeast artificial chromosome]] (YAC) and [[transformation-competent artificial chromosomes]] (TACs) were combined to assemble the genome. From clones with [[restriction fragment fingerprint]], by comparison of the patterns and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] or [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) the [[Physical map (genetics)|physical maps]] were constructed. The physical maps were integrated together with [[genetic maps]] to identify [[contig]] positions and orientations. End sequences from 47,788 BAC clones were used to extend contigs from anchored BACs and to select a minimum tiling path. A total of 1,569 clones found in minimum tiling path were selected and sequenced. Direct PCR products were used to clone remaining gaps, and YACs allowed the characterization of [[telomere]] sequences. The resulting sequenced regions were 115.4 Mb of the 125 Mb predicted size of the genome and a total of 25,498 of protein-coding genes.

To sequence and assemble the genome of Oryza Sativa (japonica),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the same strategy was used. For Oryza Sativa a total of 3,401 mapped clones in a minimum tiling path were selected from the physical map and assembled.

One of the most important crops in the world, maize (Zea mays), is the last plant genome project primarily based on Sanger BAC-by-BAC strategy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The genome size of Maize, 2.3 Gb and 10 chromosomes,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schnable PS, Ware D, Fulton RS, Stein JC, Wei F, Pasternak S, Liang C, Zhang J, Fulton L, Graves TA, Minx P, Reily AD, Courtney L, Kruchowski SS, Tomlinson C, Strong C, Delehaunty K, Fronick C, Courtney B, Rock SM, Belter E, Du F, Kim K, Abbott RM, Cotton M, Levy A, Marchetto P, Ochoa K, Jackson SM, Gillam B, Chen W, Yan L, Higginbotham J, Cardenas M, Waligorski J, Applebaum E, Phelps L, Falcone J, Kanchi K, Thane T, Scimone A, Thane N, Henke J, Wang T, Ruppert J, Shah N, Rotter K, Hodges J, Ingenthron E, Cordes M, Kohlberg S, Sgro J, Delgado B, Mead K, Chinwalla A, Leonard S, Crouse K, Collura K, Kudrna D, Currie J, He R, Angelova A, Rajasekar S, Mueller T, Lomeli R, Scara G, Ko A, Delaney K, Wissotski M, Lopez G, Campos D, Braidotti M, Ashley E, Golser W, Kim H, Lee S, Lin J, Dujmic Z, Kim W, Talag J, Zuccolo A, Fan C, Sebastian A, Kramer M, Spiegel L, Nascimento L, Zutavern T, Miller B, Ambroise C, Muller S, Spooner W, Narechania A, Ren L, Wei S, Kumari S, Faga B, Levy MJ, McMahan L, Van Buren P, Vaughn MW, Ying K, Yeh CT, Emrich SJ, Jia Y, Kalyanaraman A, Hsia AP, Barbazuk WB, Baucom RS, Brutnell TP, Carpita NC, Chaparro C, Chia JM, Deragon JM, Estill JC, Fu Y, Jeddeloh JA, Han Y, Lee H, Li P, Lisch DR, Liu S, Liu Z, Nagel DH, McCann MC, SanMiguel P, Myers AM, Nettleton D, Nguyen J, Penning BW, Ponnala L, Schneider KL, Schwartz DC, Sharma A, Soderlund C, Springer NM, Sun Q, Wang H, Waterman M, Westerman R, Wolfgruber TK, Yang L, Yu Y, Zhang L, Zhou S, Zhu Q, Bennetzen JL, Dawe RK, Jiang J, Jiang N, Presting GG, Wessler SR, Aluru S, Martienssen RA, Clifton SW, McCombie WR, Wing RA, Wilson RK | display-authors = 6 | title = The B73 maize genome: complexity, diversity, and dynamics | journal = Science | volume = 326 | issue = 5956 | pages = 1112–5 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19965430 | doi = 10.1126/science.1178534 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is significantly larger than that of rice and Arabidopsis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To assemble the genome of maize a set of 16,848 minimally overlapping BAC clones derived
 
from combinations of physical and genetic map were selected and sequenced. The assembly on [[maize]] was performed in addition with external information data. The data was obtained from [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] and sequences from libraries with methyl-filtered DNA (libraries that uses the knowledge that the bases in genic sequences tends to be less heavily methylated than those in non-genic regions) and high C0 t techniques.

Sanger clone-by-clone strategy has the advantage of working in small units, which reduces the complexity and computational requirements, as well as minimized problems associated with the misassembly of highly repetitive DNA and therefore is an attractive solution in assembling plant genomes and other complex eukaryotic genomes. The main disadvantages of this method are the costs and the resources required. The cost of the first plant genome assemblies was estimated between 70 million dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feuillet C, Leach JE, Rogers J, Schnable PS, Eversole K | title = Crop genome sequencing: lessons and rationales | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 77–88 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21081278 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2010.10.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 200 million dollars per assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saegusa A | title = US firm's bid to sequence rice genome causes stir in Japan | journal = Nature | volume = 398 | issue = 6728 | pages = 545 | date = April 1999 | pmid = 10217128 | doi = 10.1038/19123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sanger whole-genome shotgun (WGS) ===
In the [[Whole genome sequencing|WGS]] sequencing technology there is no order for the fragments that are sequenced. The DNA is randomly sheared and cloned fragments are sequenced and assembled using computational methods. This technology reduced the cost and the time associated with construction of the maps and relies on computational resources.

The draft genome of grapevine&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; is the fourth genome published for a flowering plant and the first from a fruit crop. The sequences of the genome were obtained from different types of libraries, like plasmids, fosmids and BACs. All the data were generated by paired-end sequencing of cloned insert using Sanger technology on ABI3730x1 sequencers. To assemble the reads, Arachne, 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swan KA, Curtis DE, McKusick KB, Voinov AV, Mapa FA, Cancilla MR | title = High-throughput gene mapping in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Genome Research | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 1100–5 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12097347 | pmc = 186621 | doi = 10.1101/gr.208902 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a software designed to analyze reads obtained from both ends of plasmid clones, was used. In total 6.2 million paired-end tag reads were produced. The software produced 20.784 contigs that were combined into 3,830 supercontigs, having an [[N50, L50, and related statistics|N50]] value of 64kb. Supercontigs had a total size of 498 Mb.

The anchorage of the supercontigs along the genome was performed first by joining supercontigs together using paired BAC end sequences. The resulting ultracontigs and the remained supercontigs were then aligned along the genetic map of the genome.
Later improvements of this strategy enabled the sequencing of [[Brachypodium distachyon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Genome sequencing and analysis of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon | journal = Nature | volume = 463 | issue = 7282 | pages = 763–8 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20148030 | doi = 10.1038/nature08747 | author1 = International Brachypodium Initiative | url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdaarsfacpub/1040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sorghum bicolor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paterson AH, Bowers JE, Bruggmann R, Dubchak I, Grimwood J, Gundlach H, Haberer G, Hellsten U, Mitros T, Poliakov A, Schmutz J, Spannagl M, Tang H, Wang X, Wicker T, Bharti AK, Chapman J, Feltus FA, Gowik U, Grigoriev IV, Lyons E, Maher CA, Martis M, Narechania A, Otillar RP, Penning BW, Salamov AA, Wang Y, Zhang L, Carpita NC, Freeling M, Gingle AR, Hash CT, Keller B, Klein P, Kresovich S, McCann MC, Ming R, Peterson DG, Ware D, Westhoff P, Mayer KF, Messing J, Rokhsar DS | display-authors = 6 | title = The Sorghum bicolor genome and the diversification of grasses | journal = Nature | volume = 457 | issue = 7229 | pages = 551–6 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19189423 | doi = 10.1038/nature07723 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[soybean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmutz|first=Jeremy| name-list-format = vanc |date=2009|title=Genome sequence of the palaeopolyploid soybean |journal=Nature |volume=463|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Next-generation sequencing ===
Due to its relatively cheap cost in comparison to previous methods, most of the recent plant genomes were sequenced and assembled using data from NGS (next-generation- sequencing) technology. In general the NGS data are used in combination with Sanger Sequencing technology or long-reads obtained from the [[Third-generation sequencing|third generation sequencing]].
The genome of the [[cucumber]], (Cucumis sativus),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huang S, Li R, Zhang Z, Li L, Gu X, Fan W, Lucas WJ, Wang X, Xie B, Ni P, Ren Y, Zhu H, Li J, Lin K, Jin W, Fei Z, Li G, Staub J, Kilian A, van der Vossen EA, Wu Y, Guo J, He J, Jia Z, Ren Y, Tian G, Lu Y, Ruan J, Qian W, Wang M, Huang Q, Li B, Xuan Z, Cao J, Wu Z, Zhang J, Cai Q, Bai Y, Zhao B, Han Y, Li Y, Li X, Wang S, Shi Q, Liu S, Cho WK, Kim JY, Xu Y, Heller-Uszynska K, Miao H, Cheng Z, Zhang S, Wu J, Yang Y, Kang H, Li M, Liang H, Ren X, Shi Z, Wen M, Jian M, Yang H, Zhang G, Yang Z, Chen R, Liu S, Li J, Ma L, Liu H, Zhou Y, Zhao J, Fang X, Li G, Fang L, Li Y, Liu D, Zheng H, Zhang Y, Qin N, Li Z, Yang G, Yang S, Bolund L, Kristiansen K, Zheng H, Li S, Zhang X, Yang H, Wang J, Sun R, Zhang B, Jiang S, Wang J, Du Y, Li S | display-authors = 6 | title = The genome of the cucumber, Cucumis sativus L | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 41 | issue = 12 | pages = 1275–81 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19881527 | doi = 10.1038/ng.475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the plant genomes that used the NGS [[Illumina dye sequencing|Illumina]] reads in combination with Sanger sequences. 72.2-fold genome coverage high quality base pairs were generated from which 3.9-fold coverage was provided from Sanger and the Illumina GA reads provided 68.3-fold coverage. From this two assemblies were produced based on the sequencing technology. The resulting contigs were compared between them, resulting in a total length of the assembled genome of 243.5 Mb. The result is about 30% smaller than the genome size estimated by [[flow cytometry]] of isolated nuclei stained with [[propidium iodide]] (367 Mb). A genetic map was constructed to anchor the assembled genome. 72.8% of the assembled sequences were successfully anchored onto the seven chromosomes.
Another plant genome that combined NGS with Sanger sequencing was the genome of [[Theobroma cacao]], 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Argout X, Salse J, Aury JM, Guiltinan MJ, Droc G, Gouzy J, Allegre M, Chaparro C, Legavre T, Maximova SN, Abrouk M, Murat F, Fouet O, Poulain J, Ruiz M, Roguet Y, Rodier-Goud M, Barbosa-Neto JF, Sabot F, Kudrna D, Ammiraju JS, Schuster SC, Carlson JE, Sallet E, Schiex T, Dievart A, Kramer M, Gelley L, Shi Z, Bérard A, Viot C, Boccara M, Risterucci AM, Guignon V, Sabau X, Axtell MJ, Ma Z, Zhang Y, Brown S, Bourge M, Golser W, Song X, Clement D, Rivallan R, Tahi M, Akaza JM, Pitollat B, Gramacho K, D'Hont A, Brunel D, Infante D, Kebe I, Costet P, Wing R, McCombie WR, Guiderdoni E, Quetier F, Panaud O, Wincker P, Bocs S, Lanaud C | display-authors = 6 | title = The genome of Theobroma cacao | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–8 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21186351 | doi = 10.1038/ng.736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an economically important tropical fruit tree crop. The genome was sequenced in a consortium, “The International Cocoa Genome Sequencing consortium (ICGS) “ and produced a total of 17.6 million 454 single end reads, 8.8 million 454 paired-end reads, 398.0 million Illumina paired-end reads and about 88,000 Sanger BAC reads. First by using genome assembly software, Newbler, an assembly was produced with 25,912 contigs and 4,792 scaffolds from the reads obtained from Roche/454 and Sanger raw data. This had a total length of 326.9 Mb, which represents 76% of the estimated genome size.
The Illumina reads were used to complement the [[454 Sequencing|454]] assembly, by aligning the short reads on the cocoa genome assembly using the SOAP software.
A similar strategy that combined NGS reads and Sanger Sequencing was used for other important plant species like the first published apple genome ([[Apple|Malus domestica]]),&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Velasco R, Zharkikh A, Affourtit J, Dhingra A, Cestaro A, Kalyanaraman A, Fontana P, Bhatnagar SK, Troggio M, Pruss D, Salvi S, Pindo M, Baldi P, Castelletti S, Cavaiuolo M, Coppola G, Costa F, Cova V, Dal Ri A, Goremykin V, Komjanc M, Longhi S, Magnago P, Malacarne G, Malnoy M, Micheletti D, Moretto M, Perazzolli M, Si-Ammour A, Vezzulli S, Zini E, Eldredge G, Fitzgerald LM, Gutin N, Lanchbury J, Macalma T, Mitchell JT, Reid J, Wardell B, Kodira C, Chen Z, Desany B, Niazi F, Palmer M, Koepke T, Jiwan D, Schaeffer S, Krishnan V, Wu C, Chu VT, King ST, Vick J, Tao Q, Mraz A, Stormo A, Stormo K, Bogden R, Ederle D, Stella A, Vecchietti A, Kater MM, Masiero S, Lasserre P, Lespinasse Y, Allan AC, Bus V, Chagné D, Crowhurst RN, Gleave AP, Lavezzo E, Fawcett JA, Proost S, Rouzé P, Sterck L, Toppo S, Lazzari B, Hellens RP, Durel CE, Gutin A, Bumgarner RE, Gardiner SE, Skolnick M, Egholm M, Van de Peer Y, Salamini F, Viola R | display-authors = 6 | title = The genome of the domesticated apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 42 | issue = 10 | pages = 833–9 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20802477 | doi = 10.1038/ng.654 }}&lt;/ref&gt; cotton ([[Gossypium raimondii|Gossypium Raimond]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang K, Wang Z, Li F, Ye W, Wang J, Song G, Yue Z, Cong L, Shang H, Zhu S, Zou C, Li Q, Yuan Y, Lu C, Wei H, Gou C, Zheng Z, Yin Y, Zhang X, Liu K, Wang B, Song C, Shi N, Kohel RJ, Percy RG, Yu JZ, Zhu YX, Wang J, Yu S | display-authors = 6 | title = The draft genome of a diploid cotton Gossypium raimondii | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 44 | issue = 10 | pages = 1098–103 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22922876 | doi = 10.1038/ng.2371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; draft genome of sweet orange ([[Citrus × sinensis|Citrus sinensis]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu Q, Chen LL, Ruan X, Chen D, Zhu A, Chen C, Bertrand D, Jiao WB, Hao BH, Lyon MP, Chen J, Gao S, Xing F, Lan H, Chang JW, Ge X, Lei Y, Hu Q, Miao Y, Wang L, Xiao S, Biswas MK, Zeng W, Guo F, Cao H, Yang X, Xu XW, Cheng YJ, Xu J, Liu JH, Luo OJ, Tang Z, Guo WW, Kuang H, Zhang HY, Roose ML, Nagarajan N, Deng XX, Ruan Y | display-authors = 6 | title = The draft genome of sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–66 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23179022 | doi = 10.1038/ng.2472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the domesticated tomato ([[Tomato|Solanum lycopersicum]]) genome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tomato Genome Consortium | title = The tomato genome sequence provides insights into fleshy fruit evolution | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7400 | pages = 635–41 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22660326 | pmc = 3378239 | doi = 10.1038/nature11119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third-generation ===
With the emergence of [[third-generation sequencing]] (TGS) some of the limitations from previous methods of sequencing and assembling plant genomes have started to be addressed. This technology is characterized by the parallel sequencing of single molecules of DNA, that results in sequences up to 54 kbp length ([[Pacific Biosciences|PacBio]] RS 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bleidorn|first=Christoph| name-list-format = vanc |date=2015|title=Third generation sequencing: technology and its potential impact on evolutionary biodiversity research |journal=Systematics and Biodiversity|volume=|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, long reads from TGS have relatively high error rates (~10% on average)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Hayan|last2=Gurtowski|first2=James|last3=Yoo|first3=Shinjae|last4=Nattestad|first4=Maria|last5=Marcus|first5=Shoshana|last6=Goodwin|first6=Sara|last7=McCombie|first7=W.

The price of such technology is still quite high and therefore is generally used in combination with short reads from NGS.
One of the first plant genome that used long-reads from TGS, Pacific Biosciences in combination with short reads from NGS was the genome of [[Spinach]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Deynze A | date = 2015 |title=Using spinach to compare technologies for whole genome assemblies |journal=Plant &amp; Animal Genomics XXIII Conference|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; having a genome size estimated at 989 Mb. For this, a 60× coverage of the genome was generated, with 20% of the reads larger than 20 kb. Data were assembled using PacBio’s hierarchical genome assembly process (HGAP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chin CS, Alexander DH, Marks P, Klammer AA, Drake J, Heiner C, Clum A, Copeland A, Huddleston J, Eichler EE, Turner SW, Korlach J | title = Nonhybrid, finished microbial genome assemblies from long-read SMRT sequencing data | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 563–9 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23644548 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2474 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and showed that long-read assemblies revealed a 63-fold improvement in contig size over an Illumina-only assembly.
Another plant genome that was recently published that used long reads in combination with short reads is the improved assembly of the apple genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daccord N, Celton JM, Linsmith G, Becker C, Choisne N, Schijlen E, van de Geest H, Bianco L, Micheletti D, Velasco R, Di Pierro EA, Gouzy J, Rees DJ, Guérif P, Muranty H, Durel CE, Laurens F, Lespinasse Y, Gaillard S, Aubourg S, Quesneville H, Weigel D, van de Weg E, Troggio M, Bucher E | display-authors = 6 | title = High-quality de novo assembly of the apple genome and methylome dynamics of early fruit development | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 49 | issue = 7 | pages = 1099–1106 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28581499 | doi = 10.1038/ng.3886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this project a hybrid approach was used, combining different data types from sequencing technologies. The sequences used came from: PacBio RS II, Illumina paired-end reads (PE) and Illumina mate- pair reads (MP). As a first step an assembly from Illumina paired-end reads was performed using a well-known de novo assembly software SOAPdevo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luo|first=Ruibang | name-list-format = vanc |date=2012|title=SOAPdenovo2: an empirically improved memory-efficient short-read de novo assembler |journal=Gigascience|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then using a hybrid assembly pipeline DBG2OLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ye C, Hill CM, Wu S, Ruan J, Ma ZS | title = DBG2OLC: Efficient Assembly of Large Genomes Using Long Erroneous Reads of the Third Generation Sequencing Technologies | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 31900 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27573208 | pmc = 5004134 | doi = 10.1038/srep31900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the contigs obtained at the first step and the long reads from PacBio were combined. The assembly was then polished with the help of Illumina paired-end reads by mapping them to the contigs using BWA-MEM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Heng | name-list-format = vanc |date=2013|title=Aligning sequence reads, clone sequences and assembly contigs with BWA- MEM |journal=Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT }}&lt;/ref&gt; By mapping the mate-pair reads on the corrected contigs they scaffold the assembly. Further BioNano (https://bionanogenomics.com/) optical mapping analysis with a total length of 649.7 Mb, were used in the hybrid assembly pipeline together with the scaffolds obtained from the previous step. The resulting scaffolds were anchored to a genetic map constructed from 15,417 single-nucleotide [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] (SNPs) markers. For better understanding of the number and diversity of genes that were identified, ribonucleic acid RNA-seq, were used.
The resulted genome has a dimension of 643.2 Mb getting closer to the estimated genome size than the previous published assembly&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and a smaller number of protein-coding- genes.

The use of long reads in the plant genome assemblies became more popular, for reducing the number of scaffolds and increasing the quality of the genome by improving the assembly and coverage in regions that are not clearly defined by NGS assembly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1164">In [[manufacturing engineering]], a '''product layout''' refers to a production system where the work stations and equipment are located along the line of production, as with [[assembly line]]s.

Usually, work units are moved along a line (not necessarily a [[Line (geometry)|geometric line]], but a set of interconnected work stations) by a [[conveyor]]. [[Work (project management)|Work]] is done in small amounts at each of the work stations on the line. To use the product layout, the total work to be performed must be dividable into small [[Task (project management)|tasks]] that can be assigned to each of the workstations.

Because the work stations each do small amounts of [[Work (project management)|work]], the stations utilize specific techniques and equipment tailored to the individual job they are assigned.  This can lead to a higher rate of production.

'''''Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung: The Work of a Legendary Critic: Rock 'n' Roll as Literature and Literature as Rock 'n' Roll''''' is a collection of essays written by famous rock music critic [[Lester Bangs]]. Named for a 1971 article of the same title, it was edited by [[Greil Marcus]] and released in 1987, five years after Bangs' death. In his introduction, Marcus explains that, "Perhaps what this book demands from a reader is a willingness to accept that the best writer in America could write almost nothing but record reviews."

The book consists mainly of Bangs' published articles, beginning with his early work for ''[[Creem]]'' magazine before moving into his later writings as a freelancer for ''[[New Musical Express]]'' and other publications. Many of his most famous works are present, including the title piece on garage rock band the [[Count Five]] and the [[Troggs]]-inspired "James Taylor Marked for Death" from his earlier career as well as an acclaimed profile of [[the Clash]] and a tribute to [[Van Morrison]]'s album ''[[Astral Weeks]]'' from his later years. One chapter of the book is devoted entirely to Bangs' infamous series of interviews with [[Lou Reed]], including "[[Let Us Now Praise Famous Death Dwarves]]," while another chapter features unpublished essays and an unfinished novel excerpt, "Maggie May".

A '''rebar spacer''' is a device that secures the [[reinforcing steel]] or "rebar" in [[reinforced concrete]] structures as the rebar is assembled in place prior to the final concrete pour. The spacers are left in place for the pour to keep the reinforcing in place, and become a permanent part of the structure.

The main categories of rebar spacers are:
*Linear Spacers (Π-section profiles, H-section profiles, or other 3 dimensional shapes),
*Point Spacers (wheel spacers, various tower or chair-like shapes)

Rebar spacers can be divided in three raw materials categories:
#Concrete spacers
#Plastic spacers
#Metal spacers

The concrete spacers have the advantage of the same raw material which will improve the watertightness and strength of the concrete. Plastic spacers have the advantage of the low cost production and fast processing.

== Function ==
The engineering study of every reinforced concrete [[construction]], whether it is a building, a [[bridge]], a [[bearing wall]] or other structure, predicts the positioning of steel rebars at specific positions in the volume of [[concrete]] (predicted [[concrete cover]] of steel reinforcement bars). This cover typically varies between 10 and 100&amp;nbsp;mm. The statics of every concrete construction are designed in such a way that steel and concrete properties are combined in order to achieve the maximum possible strength for the particular construction (e.g. anti-[[earthquake]] protection) as well as to prevent the long-term [[corrosion]] of [[steel]] that would weaken the construction. Rebar spacers secure the correct position of steel, thus assisting in the practical application of the theoretical specifications of concrete construction. The cover of the steel of a particular construction element (for example in a [[concrete slab]] or a [[Beam (structure)|beam]]) should be generally uniform within the element.

The use of spacers is particularly important in areas with high earthquake activity in combination with corrosive environment (like proximity to [[seawater|salt water]] of sea), as for example [[Japan]], [[Iran]], [[Greece]], [[California]] etc.

== Plastic versus concrete spacers and bar supports ==
{{Tone|date=September 2017}}
=== Plastic spacers and bar supports ===

Plastic spacers and bar supports do not bond well with concrete, therefore they are NOT compatible materials. Much of this compatibility is explained through a single phrase : Plastic has mechanical (holds the bar in position) but NO structural properties (always will remain a foreign element within the construction). But why is that? Well here is a detailed explanation of this affirmation:

When the concrete is poured into the form, a small gap is created between it and the plastic. Plastic has a coefficient of thermal expansion and contraction 10 to 15 times that of concrete, and when subjected to temperature variations, the plastic continues to expand and contract at that higher coefficient. At high temperatures, plastic can even melt. The result is a separation between the spacers and the poured concrete, creating a free passage for corrosive agents to reach the steel reinforcement from the exterior of the concrete product. This will cause the steel – and eventually the concrete – to corrode.
 
If steam curing is applied to the concrete, the heat in the curing process causes the plastic to expand while the concrete is relatively fresh and weak. After reaching the maximum curing temperature and volume expansion of the plastic, the temperature is held at this level until the concrete reaches the desired strength. After curing, the subsequent lower temperatures cause the plastic to contract, and a gap remains at the interface between the plastic and concrete.
 
Plastic spacers are also subject to corrosion when they come into contact with chlorides and chemicals, where concrete has a much higher resistance.

=== Concrete spacers and bar supports ===

Concrete spacers and bar supports are made of the same material as the poured concrete, so thermal expansion and contraction are equal. And because they are the same material, the concrete and spacers will bond. No gaps!
 
Concrete spacers and bar supports help maintain material integrity and uniformity of the concrete, and provide a cover over the reinforcement that protects against corrosion.

=== Concrete spacers with a plastic clip or other fixing mechanism ===

What about concrete spacers with a plastic clip or fixing mechanism? Does the plastic clip or fixing mechanism in the concrete spacer have a negative effect on material integrity? Does it weaken the corrosion protective cover over the reinforcement? The answer is no!
 
The plastic clip or fixing mechanism is hinged from the top of the spacer and does not come into contact with the soffit of the concrete. The plastic clip or fixing mechanism is embedded only 5&amp;nbsp;mm into the spacer, which maintains the material integrity at the product’s surface. The plastic in the clip or fixing mechanism is used only for easily attaching to and holding the reinforcement, leaving the concrete part to do the work of the spacer.

== Economics ==

Bear in mind that not only do plastic spacers offer no compatibility with the materials used in civil engineering structures, but can hold only a fraction of the weight a concrete spacer can, therefore you must use more plastic spacers to cover the same amount of reinforcement (the ratio is normally 1 to 2, but will increase if the weight of the rebar structure is increased, ratios of up to 3 to 1 have been observed), so there may be no real value either economic or technical added when plastic spacers are used.

'''Road curves''' are regular bends in [[roads]] to bring a gradual change of direction. Similar curves are on [[railways]] and [[canals]].

Curves provided in the horizontal plane are known as horizontal curves and are generally circular or parabolic.

Four types of circular curves are on roads:
* Simple curve
* Compound curve
* Reverse or serpentine curve
* Deviation curve

==Simple curve==
[[File:Curve 2014-08-18 12-57.jpg|thumb|Diagram of simple curve]]
A simple curve has the same [[radius]] throughout and is a single [[arc (geometry)|arc]] of a [[circle]], with two [[tangent]]s meeting at the intersection (B in this diagram).

==Compound curve==
[[File:Road curve 2014-08-18 12-16.jpg|thumb|Diagram of compound curve]]
A compound curve has two or more simple curves with different radii that bend the same way and are on the same side of a common tangent. In this diagram, MN is the common tangent.

==Reverse curve==
{{main article|Reverse curve}}
[[File:Curve 2014-08-18 12-52.jpg|thumb|Diagram of reverse curve]]
Also called a serpentine curve, it is the reverse of a compound curve, and two simple curves bent in opposite directions are on opposite sides of the common tangent.

==Deviation curve==
[[File:Curve 2014-08-18 12-19.jpg|thumb|Diagram of deviation curve]]
A deviation curve is simply a combination of two reverse curves. It is used when it is necessary to deviate from a given straight path to avoid intervening obstructions such as a building, a body of water, or other significant site.

'''Self-expression values''' are part of a [[Value system|core value]] dimension in the [[modernization]] process.&lt;ref name="Inglehart97"&gt;{{cite book|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|year=1997|title=Modernization and  Postmodernization:  Cultural,  Economic,  and  Political Change  in  43  Societies|location=[[Princeton, New Jersey]]|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|authorlink=Ronald Inglehart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-expression is a cluster of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] that include social toleration, [[life satisfaction]], [[public expression]] and an aspiration to liberty. [[Ronald Inglehart]], the [[University of Michigan]] professor who developed the theory of [[post-materialism]], has worked extensively with this concept. On the [[World Values Survey#Results|Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map]] ''self-expression values'' are contrasted with ''survival values'', illustrating the changes in values across countries and generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org|title=World Values Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that the world is moving towards self-expression values  was discussed at length in an article in [[the Economist]].&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, [http://www.economist.com/node/1511812 ''American Values: Living with a superpower''] January 4, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Self expression is to say something that you truly believe is important in a form of communication, such as art, speech and dance. It is to reveal yourself in a way that is special to yourself.

The emergence of the [[post-industrial society]] has brought about a wave of cultural change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|title=The silent revolution in Europe: Intergenerational change in postindustrial societies|journal=[[American Political Science Review]]|year=1971|volume=65|pages=991–1017|authorlink=Ronald Inglehart|doi=10.2307/1953494}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Western Europe]], and a growing share of [[East Asia]], a majority of the people are no longer employed in factories, but work in the [[service sector]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |work=[[CIA World Factbook]] | title = Field Listing: Labor force – by occupation | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2048.html| accessdate = 23 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a shift from a mechanical environment to one where ever more people spend their days dealing with other people, symbols, and [[information]], which means that workers in the knowledge sector must exercise their own judgment and choice.

This shift has had major consequences:
* Unprecedentedly high levels of prosperity and welfare states that make food, clothing, shelter, housing, education and health service available to almost everyone. Even in the United States, where the [[welfare state]] is relatively limited, a significant portion of the [[GDP]] is redistributed through the state. This makes physical survival, a minimum living standard, and an average life expectancy of nearly 80 years to be taken for granted by people living in the respective societies, which encourages people to focus on goals beyond immediate survival.
* Modern service jobs increasingly require use of [[cognitive skill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Florida|first=Richard|year=2002|title=The Rise of the Creative Class|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|authorlink=Richard Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers, teachers, lawyers, accountants, counselors, programmers and analysts all belong to the [[creative class]]. These workers have high autonomy in their work, even if they sometimes continue to work in hierarchical organizations. The need for cognitive skills is dramatically larger than in societies in the early stages of industrialization. To meet these needs, the labor forces of post-industrial societies increasingly pursue higher education, emphasizing creativity, imagination and intellectual independence. 
* Post-industrial societies are socially liberating compared to their predecessors. The centrally controlled, highly regimented workforces of the industrial world are gone, as are the strong [[conformity]] pressures that accompanied them. The traditional system—in which children's survival depended on their parents' providing for them, in return for which the children would take care of the parents in old age—has been undermined by the welfare state. As a result, close-knit family structures, once a necessity for survival, become increasingly a matter of choice, replacing "communities of necessity" with "elective affinities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Ulrich|year=2002|chapter=Losing the Traditional: Individualization and Precarious Freedoms|title=Individualization|location=[[London]]|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|pages=1–21|authorlink=Ulrich Beck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destandardization of economic activities and social life diminishes social constraints in unprecedented ways. The shift in post-industrial societies is thus one of emancipation from authority.&lt;ref name="Inglehart05"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Inglehart | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Welzel | first2 = Christian | lastauthoramp = yes | title = Modernization, Cultural Change and Democracy: The Human Development Sequence | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = New York | year = 2005 | ISBN = 9780521846950 | author2link=Christian Welzel}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-expression values and democracy==
[[Industrialization]] can lead to [[fascism]], [[communism]], [[theocracy]] or [[democracy]]. But post-industrial society brings socio-cultural changes that make truly effective democracy increasingly probable.

[[Knowledge society|Knowledge societies]] cannot function effectively without highly educated workers, who become articulate and accustomed to thinking for themselves. Furthermore, rising levels of economic security bring growing emphasis on self-expression values that give high priority to free choice. Mass publics become increasingly likely to want democracy, and increasingly effective in getting it. Repressing mass demands for liberalization becomes increasingly costly and detrimental to economic effectiveness. These changes link economic development with democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Inglehart | first1 = Ronald | last2 = Welzel | first2 = Christian | title = Changing Mass Priorities: The Link between Modernization and Democracy | journal = Perspectives on Politics | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 551–567 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1017/S1537592710001258}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical measurements of self-expression values==
The most thorough assessment of self-expression values is carried out in the [[World Values Survey]]. Five "[[World Values Survey#History|waves]]" have been conducted so far, each adding additional countries to the survey.

Subsequent [[data analysis]] by Inglehart revealed that a large percentage in the variability in the data could be explained by using a set of measures that tapped just two dimensions: a traditional to secular-rational axis, and a survival to self-expression axis. The factor scores were originally based on 22 variables,&lt;ref name="Inglehart97" /&gt; but this was reduced to  only 10 (5 for each dimension) for the purposes of data availability.

The self-expression axis has the following [[factor loadings]].&lt;ref name="Inglehart05" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-

In [[software project management]], [[software testing]], and [[software engineering]], '''verification and validation''' ('''V&amp;V''') is the process of checking that a software system meets specifications and that it fulfills its intended purpose. It may also be referred to as [[software quality control]].  It is normally the responsibility of [[software testing|software testers]] as part of the [[software development process|software development lifecycle]]. In simple terms, software verification is: "Assuming we should build X, does our software achieve its goals without any bugs or gaps?" On the other hand, software validation is: "Was X what we should have built? Does X meet the high level requirements?"

==Definitions==
Verification and validation are not the same things, although they are often confused. [[Barry Boehm|Boehm]] succinctly expressed the difference as&lt;ref name="PhamSoft99"&gt;{{cite book |title=Software Reliability |author=Pham, H. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc |page=567 |year=1999 |isbn=9813083840 |quote="Software Validation. The process of ensuring that the software is performing the right process. Software Verification. The process of ensuring that the software is performing the process right." Likewise and also there: "In short, Boehm (3) expressed the difference between the software verification and software validation as follows: Verification: ‘‘Are we building the product right?’’ Validation: ‘‘Are we building the right product?’’."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Verification: Are we building the product right?&lt;!--This definition is correct and sourced to Boehm. Do not change to the competing definition--&gt;
* Validation: Are we building the right product?&lt;!--This definition is correct and sourced to Boehm. Do not change to the competing definition--&gt;

Building the product right implies the use of the Requirements Specification as input for the next phase of the development process, the design process, the output of which is the Design Specification. Then, it also implies the use of the Design Specification to feed the construction process. Every time the output of a process correctly implements its input specification, the software product is one step closer to final verification. If the output of a process is incorrect, the developers are not building the product the stakeholders want correctly. This kind of verification is called "artifact or specification verification".

Building the right product implies creating a Requirements Specification that contains the needs and goals of the stakeholders of the software product. If such artifact is incomplete or wrong, the developers will not be able to build the product the stakeholders want. This is a form of "artifact or specification validation".

Note:  Verification begins before Validation and then they run in parallel until the software product is released. 

=== Software verification ===
It would imply to verify if the specifications are met by running the software but this is not possible (e. g., how can anyone know if the architecture/design/etc. are correctly implemented by running the software?). Only by reviewing its associated artifacts, someone can conclude if the specifications are met.

=== Artifact or specification verification===
The output of each software development process stage can also be subject to verification when checked against its input specification (see the definition by CMMI below).

Examples of artifact verification:
* Of the design specification against the requirement specification: Do the architectural design, detailed design and database logical model specifications correctly implement the functional and non-functional requirement specifications?
* Of the construction artifacts against the design specification: Do the source code, user interfaces and database physical model correctly implement the design specification?

=== Software validation===
Software validation checks that the software product satisfies or fits the intended use (high-level checking), i.e., the software meets the user requirements, not as specification artifacts or as needs of those who will operate the software only; but, as the needs of all the stakeholders (such as users, operators, administrators, managers, investors, etc.). There are two ways to perform software validation: internal and external. During internal software validation, it is assumed that the goals of the stakeholders were correctly understood and that they were expressed in the requirement artifacts precise and comprehensively. If the software meets the requirement specification, it has been internally validated. External validation happens when it is performed by asking the stakeholders if the software meets their needs. Different software development methodologies call for different levels of user and stakeholder involvement and feedback; so, external validation can be a discrete or a continuous event. Successful final external validation occurs when all the stakeholders accept the software product and express that it satisfies their needs. Such final external validation requires the use of an [[acceptance testing|acceptance test]] which is a [[dynamic testing|dynamic test]].

However, it is also possible to perform internal static tests to find out if it meets the requirements specification but that falls into the scope of static verification because the software is not running.

=== Artifact or specification validation ===
Requirements should be validated before the software product as a whole is ready (the waterfall development process requires them to be perfectly defined before design starts; but, iterative development processes do not require this to be so and allow their continual improvement).

Examples of artifact validation:

* User Requirements Specification validation: User requirements as stated in a document called User Requirements Specification are validated by checking if they indeed represent the will and goals of the stakeholders. This can be done by interviewing them and asking them directly (static testing) or even by releasing prototypes and having the users and stakeholders to assess them (dynamic testing).
* User input validation: User input (gathered by any peripheral such as keyboard, bio-metric sensor, etc.) is [[data validation|validated]] by checking if the input provided by the software operators or users meet the domain rules and constraints (such as data type, range, and format).

=== Validation vs. verification===
According to the [[Capability Maturity Model]] (CMMI-SW v1.1),
* Software Validation: The process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements. [IEEE-STD-610]
* Software Verification: The process of evaluating software to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase. [IEEE-STD-610]

Validation during the software development process can be seen as a form of User Requirements Specification validation; and, that at the end of the development process is equivalent to Internal and/or External Software validation. Verification, from CMMI's point of view, is evidently of the artifact kind.

In other words, software verification ensures that the output of each phase of the software development process effectively carry out what its corresponding input artifact specifies (requirement -&gt; design -&gt; software product), while software validation ensures that the software product meets the needs of all the stakeholders (therefore, the requirement specification was correctly and accurately expressed in the first place). Software verification ensures that "you built it right" and confirms that the product, as provided, fulfills the plans of the developers. Software validation ensures that "you built the right thing" and confirms that the product, as provided, fulfills the intended use and goals of the stakeholders.

This article has used the strict or [[Software verification#Narrow_scope|narrow]] definition of verification.

From a testing perspective:
* Fault – wrong or missing function in the code.
* Failure – the manifestation of a fault during execution. The software was not effective. It does not do "what" it is supposed to do.
* Malfunction – according to its specification the system does not meet its specified functionality. The software was not efficient (it took too many resources such as CPU cycles, it used too much memory, performed too many I/O operations, etc.), it was not usable, it was not reliable, etc. It does not do something "how" it is supposed to do it.

==Related concepts==
Both verification and validation are related to the concepts of [[Quality (business)|quality]] and of [[software quality assurance]]. By themselves, verification and validation do not guarantee software quality; planning, [[traceability]], configuration management and other aspects of software engineering are required.

Within the [[modeling and simulation]] (M&amp;S) community, the definitions of verification, validation and accreditation are similar:

* M&amp;S Verification is the process of determining that a [[computer model]], simulation, or federation of models and simulations implementations and their associated data accurately represent the developer's conceptual description and specifications.&lt;ref name="Missile Defense Agency"/&gt;
* M&amp;S Validation is the process of determining the degree to which a model, simulation, or federation of models and simulations, and their associated data are accurate representations of the real world from the perspective of the intended use(s).&lt;ref name="Missile Defense Agency"&gt;{{Cite document
  | year = 2008
  | title = Department of Defense Documentation of Verification, Validation &amp; Accreditation (VV&amp;A) for Models and Simulations
  | publisher = Missile Defense Agency
  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Accreditation]] is the formal certification that a model or simulation is acceptable to be used for a specific purpose.&lt;ref name="Missile Defense Agency"/&gt;
The definition of M&amp;S validation focuses on the accuracy with which the M&amp;S represents the real-world intended use(s).  Determining the degree of M&amp;S accuracy is required because all M&amp;S are approximations of reality, and it is usually critical to determine if the degree of approximation is acceptable for the intended use(s).  This stands in contrast to software validation.

==Classification of methods==
In [[mission-critical]] software systems, where flawless performance is absolutely necessary, [[formal methods]] may be used to ensure the correct operation of a system.&lt;ref name="WangPrecise14"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Bi5BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA262 |chapter=Precise Documentation and Validation of Requirements |title=Formal Techniques for Safety-Critical Systems |author=Wang, C.-W.; Ostroff, J.S.; Hudon, S. |editor=Artho, C.; Ölveczky, P.C. |publisher=Springer |pages=262–279 |year=2014 |isbn=9783319054162 |accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These formal methods can prove costly, however, representing as much as 80 percent of total software design cost.&lt;ref name="KoopmanReli07"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Reliability, Safety, and Security in Everyday Embedded Systems |title=Dependable Computing |author=Koopman, P. |editor=Bondavelli, A.; Brasileiro, F.; Rajsbaum, S. |publisher=Springer |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-75294-3_1 |isbn=978-3-540-75294-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test cases===
{{main|Test case}}
A test case is a tool used in the process. Test cases may be prepared for software verification and software validation to determine if the product was built according to the requirements of the user. Other methods, such as reviews, may be used early in the life cycle to provide for software validation.

==Independent Verification and Validation==
ISVV stands for '''Independent Software Verification and Validation'''. ISVV is targeted at safety-critical [[software]] systems and aims to increase the quality of software products, thereby reducing risks and costs through the operational life of the software. ISVV provides assurance that software performs to the specified level of confidence and within its designed parameters and defined requirements.

ISVV activities are performed by independent engineering teams, not involved in the software development process, to assess the processes and the resulting products. The ISVV team independency is performed at three different levels: financial, managerial and technical.

ISVV goes far beyond “traditional” verification and validation techniques, applied by development teams. While the latter aim to ensure that the software performs well against the nominal requirements, ISVV is focused on non-functional requirements such as robustness and reliability, and on conditions that can lead the software to fail. ISVV results and findings are fed back to the development teams for correction and improvement.

===ISVV History===
ISVV derives from the application of IV&amp;V (Independent Verification and Validation) to the software. Early ISVV application (as known today) dates back to the early 1970s when the [[U.S. Army]] sponsored the first significant program related to IV&amp;V for the Safeguard [[Anti-Ballistic Missile]] System.

By the end of the 1970s IV&amp;V was rapidly becoming popular. The constant increase in complexity, size and importance of the software lead to an increasing demand on IV&amp;V applied to software (ISVV).

Meanwhile, IV&amp;V (and ISVV for software systems) gets consolidated and is now widely used by organisations such as the DoD, FAA, NASA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivv.nasa.gov NASA IV&amp;V Facility]&lt;/ref&gt; and ESA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int ESA Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; IV&amp;V is mentioned in [DO-178B], [ISO/IEC 12207] and formalised in [IEEE 1012].

Initially in 2004-2005, a European consortium led by the [[European Space Agency]], and composed by DNV(N),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnv.com DNV Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; Critical Software SA(P),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criticalsoftware.com Critical Software SA Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; Terma(DK)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terma.com Terma Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; and CODA Scisys(UK)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scisys.co.uk Scisys Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; created the first version of a guide devoted to ISVV, called "ESA Guide for Independent Verification and Validation" with support from other organizations, e.g. SoftWcare SL (E) (&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softwcare.com SoftWcare SL Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;), etc.

In 2008 the European Space Agency released a second version, being SoftWcare SL was the supporting editor having received inputs from many different European Space ISVV stakeholders. This guide covers the methodologies applicable to all the software engineering phases in what concerns ISVV.

===ISVV Methodology===
ISVV is usually composed by five principal phases, these phases can be executed sequentially or as results of a tailoring process.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''ISVV Planning
* Planning of ISVV Activities
* System Criticality Analysis: Identification of Critical Components through a set of RAMS activities (Value for Money)
* Selection of the appropriate Methods and Tools''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Requirements Verification
* Verification for: Completeness, Correctness, Testability''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Design Verification
* Design adequacy and conformance to Software Requirements and Interfaces
* Internal and External Consistency
* Verification of Feasibility and Maintenance''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Code Verification
* Verification for: Completeness, Correctness, Consistency
* Code Metrics Analysis
* Coding Standards Compliance Verification''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Validation
* Identification of unstable components/functionalities
* Validation focused on Error-Handling: complementary (not concurrent!) validation regarding the one performed by the Development team (More for the Money, More for the Time)
* Compliance with Software and System Requirements
* [[Black box testing]] and [[White box testing]] techniques
* Experience based techniques''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Regulatory environment==
Verification and validation must meet the compliance requirements of law regulated industries, which is often guided by government agencies&lt;ref name=gpsv&gt;{{cite web

{{Star formation}}
'''Star formation''' is the process by which dense regions within [[molecular cloud]]s in [[&lt;!--Interstellar medium|The "medium" is present further soon.--&gt;interstellar space]], sometimes referred to as "stellar nurseries" or "[[star]]-forming regions", [[Jeans instability|collapse]] and form [[star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Formation of Stars|author1=Stahler, S. W.  |author2=Palla, F. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = Wiley-VCH|year = 2004|isbn = 3-527-40559-3|location = Weinheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a branch of [[astronomy]], star formation includes the study of the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) and [[giant molecular cloud]]s (GMC) as precursors to the star formation process, and the study of [[protostar]]s and [[young stellar object]]s as its immediate products.  It is closely related to [[planet formation]], another branch of [[astronomy]].  Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of [[binary star]]s and the [[initial mass function]].

===Interstellar clouds===
A [[spiral galaxy]] like the Milky Way contains [[star]]s, [[stellar remnant]]s, and a diffuse [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) of gas and dust. The interstellar medium consists of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; particles per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is typically composed of roughly 70% [[hydrogen]] by mass, with most of the remaining gas consisting of [[helium]]. This medium has been chemically enriched by trace amounts of [[Metallicity|heavier elements]] that were ejected from stars as they passed beyond the end of their [[main sequence]] lifetime. Higher density regions of the interstellar medium form clouds, or ''[[nebula|diffuse nebulae]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=C.

In the dense nebulae where stars are produced, much of the hydrogen is in the molecular (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) form, so these nebulae are called [[molecular cloud]]s.&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt; Observations indicate that the coldest clouds tend to form low-mass stars, observed first in the infrared inside the clouds, then in visible light at their surface when the clouds dissipate, while giant molecular clouds, which are generally warmer, produce stars of all masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=James | last=Lequeux | title=Birth, Evolution and Death of Stars | publisher=World Scientific | date=2013 | isbn=978-981-4508-77-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These giant molecular clouds have typical densities of 100 particles per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, diameters of {{convert|100|ly|km|lk=on}}, masses of up to 6&amp;nbsp;million [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=y}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

===Cloud collapse===
An interstellar cloud of gas will remain in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] as long as the [[kinetic energy]] of the gas [[pressure]] is in balance with the [[potential energy]] of the internal [[gravitational force]]. Mathematically this is expressed using the [[virial theorem]], which states that,  to maintain equilibrium, the gravitational potential energy must equal twice the internal thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a cloud is massive enough that the gas pressure is insufficient to support it, the cloud will undergo [[gravitational collapse]]. The mass above which a cloud will undergo such collapse is called the [[Jeans mass]]. The Jeans mass depends on the temperature and density of the cloud, but is typically thousands to tens of thousands of solar masses.&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt; This coincides with the typical mass of an [[open cluster]] of stars, which is the end product of a collapsing cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=E. | last=Battaner

In ''triggered star formation'', one of several events might occur to compress a molecular cloud and initiate its [[gravitational collapse]]. Molecular clouds may collide with each other, or a nearby [[supernova]] explosion can be a trigger, sending [[Shock wave|shocked]] matter into the cloud at very high speeds.&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt; (The resulting new stars may themselves soon produce supernovae, producing [[SSPSF model|self-propagating star formation]].)  Alternatively, [[Interacting galaxy|galactic collisions]] can trigger massive [[starburst (astronomy)|starburst]]s of star formation as the gas clouds in each galaxy are compressed and agitated by [[galactic tide|tidal forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

A [[supermassive black hole]] at the core of a galaxy may serve to regulate the rate of star formation in a galactic nucleus. A black hole that is accreting infalling matter can become [[Active galactic nucleus|active]], emitting a strong wind through a collimated [[relativistic jet]]. This can limit further star formation. Massive black holes ejecting radio-frequency-emitting particles at near-light speed can also block the formation of new stars in aging galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As it collapses, a molecular cloud breaks into smaller and smaller pieces in a hierarchical manner, until the fragments reach stellar mass. In each of these fragments, the collapsing gas radiates away the energy gained by the release of [[gravitational]] [[potential energy]].  As the density increases, the fragments become opaque and are thus less efficient at radiating away their energy. This raises the temperature of the cloud and inhibits further fragmentation. The fragments now condense into rotating spheres of gas that serve as stellar embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Complicating this picture of a collapsing cloud are the effects of [[turbulence]], macroscopic flows, [[rotation]], [[magnetic fields]] and the cloud geometry. Both rotation and magnetic fields can hinder the collapse of a cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A protostellar cloud will continue to collapse as long as the gravitational binding energy can be eliminated. This excess energy is primarily lost through radiation. However, the collapsing cloud will eventually become opaque to its own radiation, and the energy must be removed through some other means. The dust within the cloud becomes heated to temperatures of {{nowrap|60–100 K}}, and these particles radiate at wavelengths in the far infrared where the cloud is transparent. Thus the dust mediates the further collapse of the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During the collapse, the density of the cloud increases towards the center and thus the middle region becomes optically opaque first. This occurs when the density is about {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; g / cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A core region, called the First Hydrostatic Core, forms where the collapse is essentially halted. It continues to increase in temperature as determined by the virial theorem. The gas falling toward this opaque region collides with it and creates shock waves that further heat the core.&lt;ref name=larson/&gt;
[[Image:Cepheus B.jpg|thumb|left|[[Composite image]] showing young stars in and around molecular cloud [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]] B.]]
When the core temperature reaches about {{nowrap|2000 K}}, the thermal energy dissociates the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules.&lt;ref name=larson&gt;{{cite journal

The combination of convection within the protostar and radiation from its exterior allow the star to contract further.&lt;ref name=larson/&gt; This continues until the gas is hot enough for the internal [[pressure]] to support the protostar against further gravitational collapse—a state called [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. When this accretion phase is nearly complete, the resulting object is known as a [[protostar]].&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt;
[[Image:N11 (Hubble).jpg|thumb|right| N11, part of a complex network of gas clouds and star clusters within our neighbouring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud.]]
Accretion of material onto the protostar continues partially from the newly formed [[circumstellar disc]]. When the density and temperature are high enough, [[deuterium burning|deuterium fusion]] begins, and the outward [[radiation pressure|pressure]] of the resultant radiation slows (but does not stop) the collapse. Material comprising the cloud continues to "rain" onto the [[protostar]]. In this stage bipolar jets are produced called [[Herbig-Haro objects]]. This is probably the means by which excess [[angular momentum]] of the infalling material is expelled, allowing the star to continue to form.

When the surrounding gas and dust envelope disperses and accretion process stops, the star is considered a [[pre–main sequence star]] (PMS star). The energy source of these objects is gravitational contraction, as opposed to hydrogen burning in main sequence stars. The PMS star follows a [[Hayashi track]] on the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram|Hertzsprung–Russell (H–R) diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = C. Hayashi | title=Stellar evolution in early phases of gravitational contraction | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan | date=1961 | volume=13 | pages=450–452 | bibcode=1961PASJ...13..450H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contraction will proceed until the [[Hayashi limit]] is reached, and thereafter contraction will continue on a [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism|Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale]] with the temperature remaining stable. Stars with less than {{Solar mass|0.5}} thereafter join the main sequence. For more massive PMS stars, at the end of the Hayashi track they will slowly collapse in near hydrostatic equilibrium, following the [[Henyey track]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = L. G. Henyey | author2 = R. Lelevier | author3 = R. D. Levée | title=The Early Phases of Stellar Evolution | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | date=1955 | volume=67 | issue=396
| pages=154 | bibcode=1955PASP...67..154H  | doi = 10.1086/126791
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, [[hydrogen]] begins to fuse in the core of the star, and the rest of the enveloping material is cleared away. This ends the protostellar phase and begins the star's [[main sequence]] phase on the H–R diagram.

The stages of the process are well defined in stars with masses around {{Solar mass|1}} or less. In high mass stars, the length of the star formation process is comparable to the other timescales of their evolution, much shorter, and the process is not so well defined. The later evolution of stars are studied in [[stellar evolution]].

The structure of the molecular cloud and the effects of the protostar can be observed in near-IR [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] maps (where the number of stars are counted per unit area and compared to a nearby zero extinction area of sky), continuum dust emission and [[rotational transition]]s of [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] and other molecules; these last two are observed in the millimeter and [[radio astronomy|submillimeter]] range. The radiation from the protostar and early star has to be observed in [[infrared|infrared astronomy]] wavelengths, as the [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] caused by the rest of the cloud in which the star is forming is usually too big to allow us to observe it in the visual part of the spectrum. This presents considerable difficulties as the Earth's atmosphere is almost entirely opaque from 20μm to 850μm, with narrow windows at 200μm and 450μm. Even outside this range, atmospheric subtraction techniques must be used.

The formation of individual stars can only be directly observed in the [[Milky Way|Milky Way Galaxy]], but in distant galaxies star formation has been detected through its unique [[Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry|spectral signature]].

Initial research indicates star-forming clumps start as giant, dense areas in turbulent gas-rich matter in young galaxies, live about 500 million years, and may migrate to the center of a galaxy, creating the central bulge of a galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Young Star-Forming Clump in Deep Space Spotted for First Time|url = http://www.space.com/29333-star-forming-clump-discovery.html|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stars of different masses are thought to form by slightly different mechanisms.  The theory of low-mass star formation, which is well-supported by a plethora of observations, suggests that low-mass stars form by the gravitational collapse of rotating density enhancements within molecular clouds.  As described above, the collapse of a rotating cloud of gas and dust leads to the formation of an accretion disk through which matter is channeled onto a central protostar.  For stars with masses higher than about {{Solar mass|8}}, however, the mechanism of star formation is not well understood.

Massive stars emit copious quantities of radiation which pushes against infalling material.  In the past, it was thought that this [[radiation pressure]] might be substantial enough to halt accretion onto the massive protostar and prevent the formation of stars with masses more than a few tens of solar masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = M. G. Wolfire | author2 = J. P. Cassinelli | title = Conditions for the formation of massive stars | journal = Astrophysical Journal | date = 1987 | volume = 319 | issue = 1 | pages = 850–867 | bibcode = 1987ApJ...319..850W  | doi = 10.1086/165503}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent theoretical work has shown that the production of a jet and outflow clears a cavity through which much of the radiation from a massive protostar can escape without hindering accretion through the disk and onto the protostar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = C.

There is mounting evidence that at least some massive protostars are indeed surrounded by accretion disks.  Several other theories of massive star formation remain to be tested observationally.  Of these, perhaps the most prominent is the theory of competitive accretion, which suggests that massive protostars are "seeded" by low-mass protostars which compete with other protostars to draw in matter from the entire parent molecular cloud, instead of simply from a small local region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = I.

Another theory of massive star formation suggests that massive stars may form by the coalescence of two or more stars of lower mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = I. A. Bonnell | author2 = M.

"We are the first generation with the insight of the new global risks facing humanity, that people and societies are the biggest drivers of global change. The basic analysis is not in question: we cannot continue on our current path and need to take action quickly. Science can guide us in identifying the pathway to global sustainability, provided that it also engages in an open dialogue with society," says [[Professor]] [[Mario Molina]], who acted as judge and received the Nobel Prize in [[Chemistry]] in 1995.

==Conclusions==
Key conclusion of the Stockholm Memorandum include:
* that environmental sustainability is a precondition for poverty eradication, economic development, and social justice; 
* that achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]] is a top priority, since almost a third of the world scrapes by on less than $2 per day;
* that the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) is insufficient as an economic indicator and that, therefore, new human welfare indicators must be developed; 
* that global warming must be kept below 2 degrees Celsius, which, in turn, requires a global [[carbon dioxide]] emissions peak no later than 2015;
* that a new agricultural revolution must be fostered so as to produce more food in a sustainable way on agricultural land currently used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stockholm Resilience Centre]], [[Stockholm University]], 31

A '''typed [[lambda calculus]]''' is a typed [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] that uses the lambda-symbol (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) to denote anonymous function abstraction. In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see kinds below). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the [[untyped lambda calculus]] but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and ''untyped lambda calculus'' a special case with only one type.

Typed lambda calculi are foundational [[programming languages]] and are the base of typed [[functional programming languages]] such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and, more indirectly, typed [[imperative programming|imperative programming languages]]. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of [[type systems]] for programming languages; here typability usually captures desirable properties of the program, e.g. the program will not cause a memory access violation.

Typed lambda calculi are closely related to [[mathematical logic]] and [[proof theory]] via the [[Curry&amp;ndash;Howard isomorphism]] and they can be considered as the [[internal language]] of classes of [[category theory|categories]], e.g. the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] is the language of [[cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed categories]] (CCCs).

== Kinds of typed lambda calculi ==
Various typed lambda calculi have been studied. The [[simply typed lambda calculus]] has only one [[type constructor]], the arrow &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt;, and its only types are [[basic type]]s and [[function type]]s &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to\tau&lt;/math&gt;. [[Dialectica interpretation|System T]] extends the simply typed lambda calculus with a type of natural numbers and higher order primitive recursion; in this system all functions provably recursive in [[Peano arithmetic]] are definable. [[System F]] allows polymorphism by using universal quantification over all types; from a logical perspective it can describe all functions that are provably total in [[second-order logic]]. Lambda calculi with [[dependent types]] are the base of [[intuitionistic type theory]], the [[calculus of constructions]] and the [[LF (logical framework)|logical framework]] (LF), a pure lambda calculus with dependent types. Based on work by Berardi on [[pure type system]]s, [[Henk Barendregt]] proposed the [[Lambda cube]] to systematize the relations of pure typed lambda calculi (including simply typed lambda calculus, System F, LF and the calculus of constructions).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Some typed lambda calculi introduce a notion of ''[[subtype|subtyping]]'', i.e. if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a subtype of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then all terms of type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; also have type &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Typed lambda calculi with subtyping are the simply typed lambda calculus with conjunctive types and [[System F-sub|System F&lt;sub&gt;&lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;]].

All the systems mentioned so far, with the exception of the untyped lambda calculus, are ''[[strongly normalizing]]'': all computations terminate. As a consequence they are consistent as a logic, i.e. there are uninhabited types. There exist, however, typed lambda calculi that are not strongly normalizing. For example the dependently typed lambda calculus with a type of all types (Type : Type) is not normalizing due to [[Girard's paradox]]. This system is also the simplest pure type system, a formalism which generalizes the Lambda cube. Systems with explicit recursion combinators, such as [[Gordon Plotkin|Plotkin's]] PCF, are not normalizing, but they are not intended to be interpreted as a logic. Indeed, [[Programming language for Computable Functions|PCF]] (for Programming language for Computable Functions) is a prototypical, typed functional programming language, where types are used to ensure that programs are well-behaved but not necessarily terminating.

== Applications to programming languages ==
In [[computer programming]], the routines (functions, procedures, methods) of [[strongly typed programming language]]s closely correspond to typed lambda expressions.
