      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4171">[[File:Anandabodhi.jpg|thumb|320px|The Asvattha or Bodhi tree in Indian religions.]]
According to [[Hindu mythology]], '''asvattha''' ({{lang-sa|अश्वत्थ}}, [[IAST]]: aśvattha) (or '''Assattha''') that is, the ''[[Sacred Fig]]'', is a sacred tree for the [[Hindu]]s and has been extensively mentioned in texts pertaining to [[Hinduism]], mentioned as 'peepul' (''Ficus religiosa'') in [[Rig Veda]] mantra  I.164.20 . Buddhist texts term the tree as [[Bodhi tree]], a tree under which [[Gautam Buddha]] meditated and gained enlightenment.

Ashvattha is a name of [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]]; according to [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] this name is derived from the terms, shva (tomorrow) and stha (that which remains).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide|author=Roshan Dalal|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-556JuJa4QC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=ashvattha+tree&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dKC3Uv6bMozAygPCjICYCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ashvattha%20tree&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Atharvan were the recipients of gifts (given to Payu) in the Danastuti from Prince Ashvattha’s generosity ([[Rig Veda]] mantra IV.47.24); the prince identified with Divodasa by Griffith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Index of Names and Subjects Vol.1|publisher=A1 Books Co.|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6TVLlPvuMAC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;dq=sakayanya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S9G3Us7eD4rMygPeiIGYDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sakayanya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yama]] while instructing [[Naciketa]] describes the eternal Asvattha tree with its root upwards and branches downwards, which is the pure immortal [[Brahman]], in which all these worlds are situated, and beyond which there is nothing else ([[Katha Upanishad]] Verse II.vi.1). But [[Krishna]] tells us that the Asvattha tree having neither end nor beginning nor stationariness whatsoever has its roots upwards and branches downwards whose branches are nourished by the [[Gunas]] and whose infinite roots spread in the form of action in the human world which though strong are to be cut off by the forceful weapon of detachment to seek the celestial abode from which there is no return ([[Bhagavata Gita]] Chapter XV Verses 1-4). The former teaches that the Asvattha tree is real being identical with Brahman and therefore impossible to cut-off; the latter insists that the Asvattha tree must be regarded as unreal being identical with existence which needs to be cut-off. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|pages=145-146|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Puranas]] such as the Padma Purana and the Skanda Purana enumerate the very many advantages to be secured from reverentially approaching and worshipping the Ashvattha (Peepul) tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=People Trees:Worship of Trees in Northern India|author=David L.Haberman|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=73-74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-556JuJa4QC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=ashvattha+tree&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dKC3Uv6bMozAygPCjICYCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ashvattha%20tree&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first historical person named in connection with the worship of the Bodhi tree in Bodhgaya is [[Asoka]] whose Buddhist name was Piyadasi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pluralism and Identity:Studies in Ritual Behaviour|author=Jan. G. Platvoet|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=178X5n7zArwC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=ashvattha+tree&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QqS3UvmbBYfpywOnlYCQDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ashvattha%20tree&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire sticks used in Hindu sacrificial fire like [[agnihotra]] also contain dried wood of ashvatha tree.

According to the hypothesis, because of the rotation of the earth, [[erosion]] occurs mostly on the [[Stream bed|right bank]]s of rivers in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] on the [[Stream bed|left bank]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goudie|first1=Andrew|title=Baer's Law of Stream Deflection|journal=Earth Sciences History|date=2004|volume=23|issue=2|pages=278–282|doi=10.17704/eshi.23.2.q2345815206m5812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was originally introduced by a French physicist [[Jacques Babinet]] in 1859 using mathematical deduction and [[Coriolis force]]. A more definitive explanation was given by an Estonian scientist [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] in 1860.&lt;ref name=rhodes/&gt;

Although it is possible that an aggregate measurement of all rivers would lead to a correlation with the Baer–Babinet law, the Coriolis force is orders of magnitude weaker than the local forces on the river channel from its flow. Therefore, this is unlikely to be important in any given river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0076-8|date=Feb 2006|author1=Martínez-Frías, J |author2=Hochberg, D |author3=Rull, F |title=A review of the contributions of Albert Einstein to earth sciences&amp;mdash;in commemoration of the World Year of Physics|volume=93|issue=2|pages=66–71|pmid=16453104|journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|arxiv=physics/0512114|bibcode=2006NW.....93...66M}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] wrote a paper in 1926 explaining the true causes of the phenomenon (see [[tea leaf paradox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alpher|first1=R.

The '''benthic boundary layer (BBL)''' is the layer of water directly above the sediment at the bottom of a river, lake or sea. It is generated by the friction of the water moving over the surface of the substrate. The thickness of this zone is determined by many factors including the [[Coriolis force]].

The zone is of interest to biologist, geologists, sedimentologists, oceanographers, physicists and engineers as well as many other scientific disciplines. It is the area of interaction between the two environments and as such is important in many species' reproductive strategies, particularly larvae dispersal. The benthic boundary layer also contains nutrients important in fisheries, a wide array of microscopic life, a variety of suspended materials, and sharp energy gradients. It is also the sink for many anthropogenic substances released into the environment.

== Life in the Deep Sea Benthic Boundary Layer ==

The '''benthic boundary layer (BBL)''' represents a few tens of meters of the water column directly above the sea floor&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Joan E. Cartes (1998) [http://decapoda.nhm.org/pdfs/29449/29449.pdf "Dynamics of the bathyal Benthic Boundary Layer in the northwestern Mediterranean: depth and temporal variations in macrofaunal–megafaunal communities and their possible connections within deep-sea trophic webs"] Progress in Oceanography 41: 111-139&lt;/ref&gt; and constitutes an important zone of biological activity in the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-2452-2_1|chapter=Bacterial Standing Stock and Consumption of Organic Carbon in the Benthic Boundary Layer of the Abyssal North Atlantic|title=Deep-Sea Food Chains and the Global Carbon Cycle|pages=1|year=1992|last1=Lochte|first1=K.|isbn=978-94-010-5082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It plays a vital role in the cycling of matter, and has been called the “endpoint” for sedimenting material, which fuels high metabolic rates for microbial populations.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0079-6611(03)00034-X|title=Microbial activities at the benthic boundary layer in the Aegean Sea|journal=Progress in Oceanography|volume=57|issue=2|pages=219|year=2003|last1=Bianchi|first1=A|last2=Tholosan|first2=O|last3=Garcin|first3=J|last4=Polychronaki|first4=T|last5=Tselepides|first5=A|last6=Buscail|first6=R|last7=Duineveld|first7=G}}&lt;/ref&gt; After passing through the BBL, this degraded material is either returned to the [[water column]] or mobilized into the [[sediment]], where it may eventually become immobilized. With growing concern over the ultimate fate of matter in the ocean, knowledge of the complex biological processes in the [[deep sea]] BBL (deep-BBL) and how they affect future sedimentation and remineralization rates is valuable.

In the deep sea (1800&amp;nbsp;m depth or greater), the BBL is noted as having a near homogenous temperature and salinity with periodic fluxes of detrital or [[particulate organic matter]] (POM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6941.2000.tb00731.x|pmid=10967208|title=Bacteria in the cold deep-sea benthic boundary layer and sedimentâwater interface of the NE Atlantic|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|volume=33|issue=2|pages=89–99|year=2000|last1=Turley|first1=Carol}}&lt;/ref&gt; This POM is strongly linked to seasonal variations in surface productivity and hydrodynamic conditions.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Guidi-Guilvard, L.

Presently, it is known that deep-BBL bacterial populations are able to support protozoan bacterivores like foraminifera and some metazoan zooplankton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sdkVngEACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:1859962882|page=161|title=Marine Microbiology|isbn=978-1-85996-288-6|author1=Munn|first1=Colin B|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn can support larger organisms.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Meiofauna and macrofauna found in the deep-BBL include: [[copepod]]s, [[annelid]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[bivalve]]s, [[ostracod]]s, [[isopod]]s, [[amphipod]]s, [[arthropod]]s and [[gastropod]]s, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0967-0645(99)00064-8|title=Deep-sea macrofaunal assemblages within the Benthic Boundary Layer of the Cap-Ferret Canyon (Bay of Biscay, NE Atlantic)|journal=Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography|volume=46|issue=10|pages=2309|year=1999|last1=Sorbe|first1=Jean Claude}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; These organisms ultimately play a vital role in the remineralization of matter and aid in breaking down POM that may eventually become permanent sediment.

As the effects of anthropogenic forcing begin taking an even greater toll on marine processes, long-term studies are essential in determining the health and stability of the deep-BBL. Currently, several groups are employing [[cabled observatories]] (ALOHA Cabled Observatory, [[Monterey Accelerated Research System]], [[NEPTUNE]], [[VENUS]], and [[Liquid Jungle Lab (LJL) Panama- PLUTO]]) to work towards developing these much needed time-series.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

The '''Bolivian montane dry forests''' (NT0206) is an ecoregion in Bolivia on the eastern side of the [[Andes]]. It is a transitional habitat between the puna grasslands higher up to the west and the Chaco scrub to the east. The habitat is under severe stress from a growing human population.

==Geography==

===Location===
{{location map|Bolivia|relief=yes|lat_deg=-18.367 |lon_deg=-65.039 |caption=Location in Bolivia|width=220px}}
The ecoregion is in the dry mountain valleys of the Andes in southern Bolivia. It has an area of {{convert|8,028,963|ha}}.{{sfn|Bolivian montane dry forests – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}} In the south large areas of the ecoregion are found within the [[Central Andean puna]] and [[Southern Andean Yungas]]. To the east the dry forests transition into the [[Dry Chaco]] ecoregion. Further north smaller areas of the ecoregion are found in contact with the [[Central Andean dry puna]], [[Central Andean wet puna]] and [[Bolivian Yungas]].{{sfn|WildFinder – WWF}}

===Terrain===

The terrain is rugged, with cliffs, steep hillsides, valleys and gullies.{{sfn|Bolivian montane dry forests – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}

Altitudes are from {{convert|360-700|m}} above sea level.

In the east fingers of the dry forest stretch into the [[yungas]], while in the west fingers of [[puna grassland]] extend into the dry forest.{{sfn|Brooks}}

===Climate===

At a sample location at {{coord|-18.75 | -65.25}} the [[Köppen climate classification]] is "Cwb": warm temperate, winter dry, warm summer.{{sfn|Bolivian montane dry forests – Myers|loc=Climate Data}} At this location the mean monthly temperatures range from {{convert|13.5|C}} in July to {{convert|18.8|C}} in November.
Yearly total precipitation is about {{convert|580|mm}}. Average monthly precipitation is below {{convert|10|mm}} in May–August, and rises to {{convert|137.4|mm}} in January.{{sfn|Bolivian montane dry forests – Myers|loc=Climate Data}}

==Ecology==

The ecoregion is in the [[Neotropical realm|neotropical]] realm, in the [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests]] biome.{{sfn|Bolivian montane dry forests – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}

===Flora===
[[File:Acaciacaven29b.jpg|thumb|''[[Vachellia caven]]'']]
The dry forest ecoregion is a transitional habitat between the puna grasslands higher up to the west and the Chaco scrub to the east. It contains dry slopes with scattered shrubs and columnar cacti, seasonal dry forest and wetland forest along river courses.{{sfn|Bolivian montane dry forests – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}} Where the spiny forest has been unaltered it holds species such as ''[[Vachellia caven]]'', ''[[Prosopis alpataco]]'', ''[[Dodonaea viscosa]]'', ''[[Schinopsis marginata]]'' and [[Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco]].{{sfn|Brooks}}

===Fauna===

Several mammal species more common in the tropics are at the southern limit of their territory in the ecoregion. There appear to be a variety of feline species including [[cougar]] (''Puma concolor''), [[ocelot]] (''Leopardus pardalis''), [[Pampas cat]] (''Leopardus pajeros''), [[Geoffroy's cat]] (''Leopardus geoffroyi'') and [[jaguarundi]] (''Puma yagouaroundi'').{{sfn|Brooks}} Endangered mammals include the [[Bolivian chinchilla rat]] (''Abrocoma boliviensis'') and [[short-tailed chinchilla]] (''Chinchilla chinchilla'').{{sfn|Bolivian montane dry forests – Myers|loc=All Endangered}}

Endemic birds include the [[Bolivian recurvebill]] (''Syndactyla striatus''), [[Bolivian blackbird]] (''Oreopsar bolivianus''), [[citron-headed yellow finch]] (''Sicalis luteocephala''), [[Cochabamba mountain finch]] (''Compsospiza garleppi''), [[Bolivian warbling finch]] (''Poospiza boliviana''), [[torrent duck]] (''Merganetta armata''), [[wedge-tailed hillstar]] (''Oreotrochilus adela''), [[black-hooded sunbeam]] (''Aglaeactis pamela'') and [[grey-bellied flowerpiercer]] (''Diglossa carbonaria'').{{sfn|Brooks}} Endangered birds include the [[red-fronted macaw]] (''Ara rubrogenys'') and [[Bolivian spinetail]] (''Cranioleuca henricae'').{{sfn|Bolivian montane dry forests – Myers|loc=All Endangered}}

Endangered amphibians include the frog ''[[Telmatobius sibiricus]]''.{{sfn|Bolivian montane dry forests – Myers|loc=All Endangered}}

==Status==

The subtropical lower montane dry and moist life zones in the deep valleys between the mountains of the eastern ''Cordillera'' include the towns of [[Comarapa]], Independencia, [[Totora, Cochabamba|Totora]], [[Tapacarí]] and [[Arque]]. These are the most favorable areas for human settlement, and have long been farmed, leaving little of the original vegetation.{{sfn|Hartshorn|1979|p=13:3}}

The [[World Wildlife Fund]] gives the Bolivian montane dry forests ecoregion the status of "Critical/Endangered". The growing human population is creating urban sprawl and over-hunting, collecting wood for fuel and converting land for agriculture, causing [[habitat fragmentation]].{{sfn|Brooks}}

Protected areas include the [[Madidi National Park]] and the [[Cordillera de Sama Biological Reserve]].{{sfn|Bolivian montane dry forests – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}
Others are the [[Tariquía Flora and Fauna National Reserve]] and [[Torotoro National Park]].

'''Cartographic generalization''', or map generalization, is a method for deriving a [[scale (map)|smaller-scale]] [[map]] from a larger scale map or map data&lt;ref name="Li 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Zhilin|title=Digital Map Generalization at the Age of the Enlightenment: A review of the First Forty Years|journal=The Cartographic Journal|date=February 2007|volume=44|issue=1|pages=80–93|accessdate=|doi=10.1179/000870407x173913}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Whether done manually by a [[cartographer]] or by a computer or set of [[algorithms]], [[generalization]] seeks to abstract [[geospatial information|spatial information]] at a high level of detail to information that can be rendered on a map at a lower level of detail. For example, we might have the outlines of all of the thousands of buildings in a region, but we wish to make a map of the whole city no more than a few inches wide. Instead of throwing out the building information, or trying to render it all at once, we could generalize the data into some sort of outline of the [[urban area|urbanized area]] of the region.

The cartographer has license to adjust the content within their maps to create a suitable and useful map that conveys spatial information, while striking the right balance between the map's purpose and the precise detail of the subject being mapped. Well generalized maps are those that emphasize the most important map elements while still representing the world in the most faithful and recognizable way.

==Methods==
There are many cartographic techniques that may fall into the broad category of generalization.&lt;ref name="Li 2007" /&gt; Here are brief descriptions of some of the more common methods:

===Selection===

Map generalization is designed to reduce the complexities of the [[reality|real world]] by strategically reducing ancillary and unnecessary details. One way that [[geospatial]] data can be reduced is through the selection process.&lt;ref name="Topfer 1966"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Topfer|first1=F|last2=Pillwizer|first2=W|title=The Principles of Selection|journal=The Cartographic Journal|date=1966|pages=10–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartographer can select and retain certain elements that he/she deems the most necessary or appropriate. In this method, the most important elements stand out while lesser elements are left out entirely. For example, a directional map between two points may have lesser and un-traveled roadways omitted as not to confuse the map-reader. The selection of the most direct and uncomplicated route between the two points is the most important data, and the cartographer may choose to emphasize this.

===Simplification===
Generalization is not a process that only removes and selects data, but also a process that simplifies or abstracts it as well. Simplification is a technique where the general shapes of features are retained, while eliminating unnecessary detail. Generally, smaller scale maps have more simplified features than larger scale maps. The [[Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm]] is one of the earliest and still most common techniques for line simplification.

Simplification can be achieved in different ways: by eliminating parts of and giving an area a more familiar shape, by removing unimportant points off a shape - usually performed by a software, by eliminating small features such as islands, or by smoothing "rough" features such as straightening curvy lines to highlight their trend.&lt;ref name="Stern, Hurni, Werner, Wiesmann 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Boris|title=Generalisation of Map Data|journal=Geographic Information Technology Training Alliance|date=2014|pages=08–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combination===

Simplification also takes on other roles when considering the role of combination.  Overall data reduction techniques can also mean that in addition to generalizing elements of particular features, features can also be combined when their separation is irrelevant to the map focus.  A mountain chain may be isolated into several smaller ridges and peaks with intermittent forest in the natural environment, but shown as a continuous chain on the map, as determined by scale.  The map reader has to, again remember, that because of scale limitations combined elements are not concise depictions of natural or manmade features.

===Smoothing===

[[Smoothing]] is also a process that the map maker can employ to reduce the angularity of line work.  Smoothing is yet another way of simplifying the map features, but involves several other characteristics of generalization that lead into feature displacement and locational shifting.  The purpose of smoothing is to exhibit linework in a much less complicated and a less visually jarring way.  An example of smoothing would be for a jagged roadway, cut through a mountain, to be smoothed out so that the angular turns and transitions appear much more fluid and natural.

===Enhancement===

Enhancement is also a method that can be employed by the cartographer to illuminate specific elements that aid in map reading.  As many of the aforementioned generalizing methods focus on the reduction and omission of detail, the enhancement method concentrates on the addition of detail.  Enhancement can be used to show the true character of the feature being represented and is often used by the cartographer to highlight specific details about his or her specific knowledge, that would otherwise be left out.  An example includes enhancing the detail about specific river rapids so that the map reader may know the facets of traversing the most difficult sections beforehand.  Enhancement can be a valuable tool in aiding the map reader to elements that carry significant weight to the map’s intent.

===Displacement===

Displacement can be employed when 2 objects are so close to each other that they would overlap at smaller scales. A common place where this would occur is the cities Brazzaville and Kinshasa on either side of the Congo river in Africa. They are both the capital city of their country and on overview maps they would be displayed with a slightly larger symbol than other cities. Depending on the scale of the map the symbols would overlap. By displacing both of them away from the river (and away from their true location) the symbol overlap can be avoided. Another common case is when a road and a railroad run parallel to each other. this is mostly adopted using the azimuthal projection method.

===Exaggeration===

Exaggeration is the selection of map [[symbol]]s that make features appear larger than they really are to make them more visible, recognizable, or higher in the [[visual hierarchy]]. For example, in a small-scale map, highways, rivers, and railroads may be drawn as thick lines that would be miles wide if measured according to the scale. Exaggeration often necessitates a subsequent displacement operation because wide lines representing features located near each other will overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Boris|title=Generalisation of Map Data|journal=Geographic Information Technology Training Alliance|date=2014|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggregation===

Aggregation is the merger of multiple features into a new composite feature. The new feature is of a type different than the original individuals, because it conceptualizes the group. For example, a multitude of buildings can be turned into a single region representing an "urban area."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=Boris|title=Generalisation of Map Data|journal=Geographic Information Technology Training Alliance|date=2014|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GIS and automated generalization==
As [[geographic information systems|GIS]] developed from about the late 1960s onward, the need for automatic, algorithmic generalization techniques became clear. Ideally, agencies responsible for collecting and maintaining spatial data should try to keep only one canonical representation of a given feature, at the highest possible level of detail. That way there is only one record to update when that feature changes in the real world.&lt;ref name="Li 2007" /&gt; From this large-scale data, it should ideally be possible, through automated generalization, to produce maps and other data products at any scale required. The alternative is to maintain separate databases each at the scale required for a given set of mapping projects, each of which requires attention when something changes in the real world.

Several broad approaches to generalization were developed around this time:

* The ''representation-oriented'' view focuses on the representation of data on different scales, which is related to the field of Multi-Representation [[Database]]s (MRDB).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* The ''process-oriented'' view focuses on the process of generalization.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* The ''ladder-approach'' is a stepwise generalization, in which each derived dataset is based on the other database of the next larger scale.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
* The ''star-approach'' is the derived data on all scales is based on a single (large-scale) data base.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Scaling law==
There are far more small geographic features than large ones in the Earth's surface, or far more small things than large ones in maps. This notion of far more small things than large ones is also called spatial heterogeneity, which has been formulated as scaling law.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2015a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Geospatial analysis requires a different way of thinking: The problem of spatial heterogeneity|journal=GeoJournal|date=2015a|volume=80|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1007/s10708-014-9537-y|arxiv=1401.5889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartographic generalization or any mapping practices in general is essentially to retain the underlying scaling of numerous smallest, a very few largest, and some in between the smallest and largest.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2015b"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=The fractal nature of maps and mapping|journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science|date=2015b|volume=29|issue=1|pages=159–174|doi=10.1080/13658816.2014.953165|arxiv=1406.5410}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mapping process can be efficiently and effectively achieved by '''[[Head/tail Breaks|head/tail breaks]]''',&lt;ref name="Jiang 2015c"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Head/tail breaks for visualization of city structure and dynamics|journal=Cities|date=2015c|volume=43|issue=3|pages=69–77|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2014.11.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jiang 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Head/tail breaks: A new classification scheme for data with a heavy-tailed distribution|journal=The Professional Geographer|date=2013|volume=65|pages=482–494|doi=10.1080/00330124.2012.700499}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new classification scheme or visualization tool for data with a heavy tailed distribution. Scaling law is likely to replace Töpfer's radical law to be a universal law for various mapping practices. What underlies scaling law is something of paradigm shift from Euclidean geometry to fractal, from non-recursive thinking to recursive thinking.&lt;ref name="Jiang 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Bin|title=Scaling as a design principle for cartography|journal=Annals of GIS|date=2017|volume=23|issue=1|pages=67–69|doi=10.1080/19475683.2016.1251491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 'Baltimore Phenomenon'==
The Baltimore Phenomenon{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} is the tendency for a city (or other object) to be omitted from maps due to space constraints while smaller cities are included on the same map simply because space is available to display them. This phenomenon owes its name to the city of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], which tends to be omitted on maps due to the presence of larger cities in close proximity within the Mid-Atlantic United States. As larger cities near Baltimore appear on maps, smaller and lesser known cities may also appear at the same scale simply because there is enough space for them on the map.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Although the Baltimore Phenomenon occurs more frequently on automated mapping sites, it does not occur at every scale. Popular mapping sites like Google Maps, Bing Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Yahoo Maps will only begin displaying Baltimore at certain zoom levels: 5th, 6th, 7th, etc.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Many types of '''trees''' found in the [[Celtic nations]] are considered to be sacred, whether as symbols, or due to [[ethnobotany|medicinal properties]], or because they are seen as the abode of particular nature spirits. Historically and in folklore, the respect given to trees varies in different parts of the Celtic world. On the Isle of Man, the phrase 'fairy tree' often refers to the [[Sambucus nigra|elder tree]].&lt;ref&gt;McKillop, James (1998). 'Fairy tree.' ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval [[Welsh language|Welsh]] poem ''[[Cad Goddeu]] (The Battle of the Trees)'' is believed to contain Celtic tree lore, possibly relating to the ''crann ogham'', the branch of the [[ogham]] alphabet where tree names are used as [[mnemonic]] devices.

==List of trees==
===Oak===
The [[Quercus robur|oak]] tree features prominently in many Celtic cultures. The ancient geographer [[Strabo]] (1st century AD) reported that the important sacred grove and meeting-place of the [[Galatia]]n Celts of Asia Minor, Drunemeton, was filled with oaks. In an often-cited passage from Historia Naturalis (1st century AD), [[Pliny the Elder]] describes a festival on the sixth day of the moon where the [[druid]]s climbed an oak tree, cut a bough of mistletoe, and sacrificed two white bulls as part of a fertility rite. Britons under Roman occupation worshipped a goddess of the oak tree, Daron, whose name is commemorated in a rivulet in [[Gwynedd]]. According to the pseudo-history [[Lebor Gabála]] 'Book of Invasions', the sacred oak of early Ireland was that of Mugna, probably located at or near Dunmanogoe, south Co. Kildare. Sacred associations of oaks survived Christianization, so that [[St Brigit]]'s monastic foundation was at Cill Dara, 'church of (the) oak', i.e. Kildare, and [[St Colum Cille]] favoured Doire Calgaich 'Calgach's oak grove', i.e. [[Derry]]; see also [[Durrow (disambiguation)|Durrow]], darú, from dair magh, 'oak plain'. In Welsh tradition [[Gwydion]] and [[Math fab Mathonwy|Math]] use the flower of oak with broom to fashion the beautiful [[Blodeuwedd]]. When [[Lleu Llaw Gyffes]] is about to be killed by [[Gronw Pebyr]], his wife's lover, he escapes in [[eagle]] form onto a magic oak tree. In British fairy lore, the oak is one of three primary magical woods, along with [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]] and [[Crataegus monogyna|thorn]]. 

In Proto-Celtic the words for "oak" were *''daru'' and *''derwā''; Old Irish and Modern Irish, ''dair''; Scottish Gaelic, ''darach''; Manx, ''daragh''; Welsh, ''derwen, dâr''; Cornish ''derowen''; Breton, ''dervenn''.&lt;ref&gt;McKillop, James (1998). 'Oak' ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ash===
The [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash tree]] also features strongly in Irish mythology. The mountain ash, [[Sorbus aucuparia|rowan]], or quicken tree is particularly prominent in Scottish folklore.&lt;ref&gt;McKillop, James (1998). 'Ash.' ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several recorded instances in Irish history in which people refused to cut an ash, even when wood was scarce, for fear of having their own cabins consumed with flame. The ash tree itself might be used in May Day ([[Beltaine]]) rites. Under the Old Irish word nin, the ash also gives its name to the letter N in the [[ogham]] alphabet. Together with the [[oak]] and thorn, the ash is part of a magical trilogy in fairy lore. Ash seedpods may be used in [[divination]], and the wood has the power to ward off fairies, especially on the Isle of Man. In Gaelic Scotland children were given the astringent sap of the tree as a medicine and as a protection against witch-craft. Some famous ash trees were the Tree of [[Uisnech]], the Bough of [[Bough of Dathí|Dathí]], and the Tree of [[Tortu]]. The French poet who used Breton sources, [[Marie de France]] (late 12th century), wrote a [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]] about an ash tree. The Proto-Celti for 'ash' was *''onnos''; Old Irish, ''nin''; Irish, ''fuinseog''; Scots Gaelic, ''fuinnseann''; Manx, ''unjin''; Welsh, ''onnen''; Cornish, ''onnen''; Breton, ''onnenn''.&lt;ref&gt;McKillop, James (1998). 'ash tree.' ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple===
The [[pome]] fruit and tree of the [[Malus sylvestris|apple]] is celebrated in numerous functions in Celtic mythology, legend, and folklore; it is an emblem of fruitfulness and sometimes a means to immortality. Wands of [[druids]] were made from wood either of the [[Taxus baccata|yew]] or of the apple. The Brythonic [[Avalon]] in Arthurian tradition in certain medieval narratives, attributing Welsh origin, is translated as ''Insula Pomorum''; 'The Isle of Apples'. One gloss of the name for the magical Irish island [[Emain Ablach]] is 'Emain of the Apples'. In the [[Ulster Cycle]] the soul of [[Cú Roí]] was confined in an apple that lay in the stomach of a [[salmon]] which appeared once every seven years. [[Cúchulainn]] once gained his escape by following the path of a rolled apple. An apple-tree grew from the grave of the tragic lover [[Ailinn]]. In the Irish tale [[Echtra Condla]] (The Adventure of Conle), [[Connla the Ruddy|Conle]] the son of [[Conn of the Hundred Battles|Conn]] is fed an apple by a [[leannán sídhe|fairy lover]], which sustains him with food and drink for a month without diminishing; but it also makes him long for the woman and the beautiful country of women to which his lover is enticing him. In the Irish story from the [[Mythological Cycle]], [[Oidheadh Chlainne Tuireann]], the first task given the Children of Tuireann is to retrieve the [[Apples of the Hesperides]] (or Hisbernia). Afallennau (Welsh, 'apple trees') is a 12th-century Welsh narrative poem dealing with [[Myrddin Wyllt]]. The Breton pseudosaint [[Konorin]] was reborn by means of an apple. The Proto-Celtic word was *''aballā''; Old Irish, ''uball'', ''ubull''; Modern Irish. ''ubhal'', ''úll''; Scots Gaelic ''ubhall''; Manx, ''ooyl''; Welsh, ''afal''; Corn. ''aval''; Bret. ''Aval''.&lt;ref&gt;McKillop, James (1998). 'apple.' ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hazel===
Both the wood and the edible nuts of the [[Corylus avellana|hazel]] have played important roles in Irish and Welsh traditions. Hazel leaves and nuts are found in early British burial mounds and shaft-wells, especially at [[Ashill, Norfolk]]. The place-name story for Fordruim, an early name for Tara, describes it as a pleasant hazel wood. In the ogham alphabet of early Ireland, the letter C was represented by hazel [OIr. coll]. According to Robert Graves, it also represented the ninth month on the Old Irish calendar, 6 August to 2 September. Initiate members of the [[Fianna]] had to defend themselves armed only with a hazel stick and a shield; yet in the [[Fenian]] legends the hazel without leaves was thought evil, dripping poisonous milk, and the home of vultures. Thought a fairy tree in both Ireland and Wales, wood from the hazel was sacred to poets and was thus a taboo fuel on any hearth. Heralds carried hazel wands as badges of office. Witches' wands are often made of hazel, as are divining rods, used to find underground water. In Cornwall the hazel was used in the [[millpreve]], the magical [[adder stone]]s. In Wales a twig of hazel would be given to a rejected lover.

Even more esteemed than the hazel's wood were its nuts, often described as the 'nuts of wisdom', e.g. esoteric or occult knowledge. Hazels of wisdom grew at the heads of the seven chief rivers of Ireland, and nine grew over both [[Connla's Well]] and the [[Well of Segais]], the legendary common source of the [[River Boyne|Boyne]] and the [[River Shannon|Shannon]]. The nuts would fall into the water, causing bubbles of mystic inspiration to form, or were eaten by [[salmon]]. The number of spots on a salmon's back were thought to indicate the number of nuts it had consumed. The salmon of wisdom caught by [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] had eaten hazel nuts. Very similar tales related by [[Taliesin]] are retained in the Brythonic tradition. Traces of hazelnuts have been found in a 'Celtic' style three-chained suspension bowl discovered in a post-Roman burial dated to 650 CE in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/Explore-online/Past/MissingLink/Exhibits/TML_exhibits_mansgrave.htm A Man's Grave], Museum of London&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the Irish hero [[Mac Cuill]] means 'son of the hazel'. [[W. B. Yeats]] thought the hazel was the common Irish form of the [[tree of life]]. Proto-Celtic was *''collos''; Old Irish and Modern Irish ''coll'; Scots Gaelic, ''calltunn'', ''calltuinn''; Manx, ''coull''; Welsh, ''collen''; Cornish, ''collwedhen''; Breton, ''kraoñklevezenn''.&lt;ref&gt;McKillop, James (1998). 'hazel.' ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alder===
The [[alnus glutinosa|alder]], a shrub or tree of the birch family has special implications in Celtic tradition. The alder usually grows in wet ground, with small, pendulous catkins. Alders are especially associated with [[Bendigeidfran|Bran]]; at [[Cad Goddeu]], 'The Battle of the Trees', [[Gwydion]] guessed Bran's name from the alder twigs in his hand. The answer to an old Taliesin riddle 'Why is the alder purple?' is 'Because Bran wore purple'. Bran's alder may be a symbol of resurrection. The name for the boy [[Gwern]], son of [[Matholwch]] and [[Branwen]], means 'alder'. The place-name [[Fernmag]] (ang. Farney) means 'plain of the alder'.

In Ireland the alder was regarded with awe apparently because when cut the wood turns from white to red. At one time the felling of an alder was punishable, and it is still avoided. The alder was thought to have power of divination, especially in the diagnosing of diseases. Alder might be used in the [[fé]], a rod for measuring corpses and graves in pre-Christian Ireland. The letter F, third consonant in the [[ogham]] alphabet, was named after the alder. The Proto-Celtic was *''wernā''; Old Irish ''fern'';. Modern Irish is ''fearnóg''; Scots Gaelic, ''feàrna''; Manx, ''farney''; Welsh, ''gwernen''; Cornish, ''gwernen''; Breton, ''gwernenn''.&lt;ref&gt;McKillop, James (1998). 'alder.' ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elder===
The [[Sambucus nigra|elder]], having clusters of white flowers and red or blackish berry-like fruit, has many associations with the fairy world in oral traditions of recent centuries in Celtic countries. On the Isle of Man, where elder grows abundantly and is called tramman, it is commonly thought of as the 'fairy tree'. In Ireland many individual elder trees were thought haunted by fairies or demons. Old Irish is ''tromm''; Modern Irish is ''trom''; Scots Gaelic, ''troman, droman''; Welsh, ''ysgawen''; Cornish, ''scawen''; Breton, ''skavenn''.&lt;ref&gt;McKillop, James (1998). 'elder tree.' ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yew===
The evergreen [[Taxus baccata|yew]] with dark green, needle-like leaves and red berries has commonly symbolized immortality in the Indo-European imagination as it is the longest-lived entity, often lasting more than 1,000 years, to be found in the European environment. It is still commonly planted in Christian churchyards and cemeteries. The [[druids]] preferred yew for wand-making over their other favourite woods, [[apple]] and [[oak]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The name of the [[Eburones]], a Gaulish people residing between the Main and Rhine, means 'people of the yew', while several Irish and Scottish place-names allude to the yew, notably [[Youghall]] [Eochaill, yew wood] in [[County Cork]]. The Irish personal name [[Eógan]] means 'born of the yew', so that the great [[Munster]] dynasty could be glossed as 'people of the yew'. According to the [[foundation story]] of [[Cashel, County Tipperary|Cashel]], the [[Eóganacht]] capital, [[Corc mac Luigthig]] has a vision of a yew bush, with angels dancing over it, before settling on the site. One of [[Conchobar mac Nessa]]'s residences at [[Emain Macha]], [[Cráebruad]], has nine rooms lined with red yew. [[Suibne Geilt]] in [[Buile Shuibhne]] (The Frenzy of Suibne) rests on yew trees during his flight. When [[Eógan]] and [[Lugaid mac Con]] are disputing they hear the magical music of the yew tree over a waterfall; the musician is revealed to be [[Fer Í]] (man of yew), the son of [[Eogabal]]. Wielders of the spear [[Gáe Assail]] are sure to kill their victims if they utter the word "ibar" (yew) as they cast. The agnomen of [[Cáer]], the swan maiden, is [[Ibormeith]] [yew berry]. In oral variants of the [[Deirdre]] story, King [[Conchobar mac Nessa]] drives yew stakes through the hearts of the dead lovers, which later grow and intertwine near a church. Yet not all stories of the yew imply power or vitality. A rod named [[fé]], made of yew or alder, was used to measure corpses and graves. And [[Fergus (son of Eochaid Mugmedon)|Fergus]], the hapless brother of [[Niall Noígiallach]] (of the Nine Hostages) in [[Echtra Mac nEchach Muigmedóin]] (The Adventure of the Sons of Eochaid Mugmedón), signals his sterility when he rescues from a burning forge only the 'withered wood' of yew, which will not burn. The Proto-Celtic words for "yew" were *''eburos'' and *''iwos''; Old Irish ''ibar''; Modern Irish, ''iúr''; Scots Gaelic, ''iubhar''; Manx, ''euar''; Welsh, ''ywen''; Cornish, ''ewen''; Breton, ''ivinenn''.&lt;ref&gt;McKillop, James (1998). 'yew.' ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6274">'''Citizens' Military Training Camps''' (CMTC) were military training programs of the United States. Held annually each summer during the years 1921 to 1940, the CMTC camps differed from [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] and [[United States Army Reserve|Organized Reserve]] training in that the program allowed male citizens to obtain basic military training without an obligation to call-up for active duty. The CMTC were authorized by the National Defense Act of 1920 as a compromise that rejected [[conscription|universal military training]]. The CMTC was preceded by the [[Plattsburg Movement]], a series of summer training camps that in 1915 and 1916 hosted some 40,000 men largely of elite social classes, the later CMTC trained some 400,000 men from 1921 to 1940.

==Plattsburgh camps==
The CMTC was a continuation of the "Plattsburgh camps", a volunteer pre-enlistment training program organized by private citizens before the U.S. entry into [[World War I]]. The camps were set up and funded by the [[Preparedness Movement]], a group of influential pro-[[Allies of World War I|Allied]] Americans. They recognized that the standing U.S. Army was far too small to affect the war and would have to expand immensely if the U.S. went to war.&lt;ref&gt;''Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh, and America's Fight Over World War II, 1939-1941'' by [[Lynne Olson]], Random House, 2013, {{ISBN|9781400069743}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Movement established the camps to train additional potential Army officers during the summers of 1915 and 1916. The largest and best known was near [[Plattsburgh, New York]] and had such students as [[Grenville Clark]], [[Willard Straight]], [[Robert Bacon]], Mayor [[John Purroy Mitchel]] &amp; Bishop [[James De Wolf Perry]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Colonel Roosevelt]]'', by [[Edmund Morris (writer)|Edmund Morris]], page 433, published 2010 by [[Random House]], {{ISBN|9780375504877}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Plattsburg_Movement.html?id=ti67SI0n-goC|title=The Plattsburg Movement: A Chapter of America's Participation in the World War|first=Ralph Barton|last=Perry|date=4 September 2018|publisher=E.P.

40,000 men (all college graduates) attended the Plattsburgh camp and other sites. They became physically fit, learned to march and shoot, and ultimately provided the cadre of a wartime officer corps. Enlistees were required to pay their own expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Slotkin, Richard. "The Lost Battalions: the Great War and the crisis of American nationality"&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestions by labor unions that talented working-class youth be invited to Plattsburgh were ignored.

These camps were formalized under the Military Training Camps Association, which in 1917 launched a monthly magazine, ''National Service''.&lt;ref name="NYT1917"&gt;{{cite news |title=Magazine to Push National Service |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= February 5, 1917 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/02/05/102317219.pdf |accessdate=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1922, the magazine was acquired by and folded into ''[[Armed Forces Journal|The American Army and Navy Journal, and Gazette of the Regular, National Guard and Reserve Forces]]''.)

==CMTC==

CMTC camps were a month in length and held at about 50 Army posts nationally. At their peak in 1928 and 1929, about 40,000 men received training, but as a whole the camps were a disappointment at their multiplicity of stated goals, but particularly in the [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioning]] of Organized Reserve officers. The program established that participants could receive a Reserve commission as a [[second lieutenant]] by completing four successive summer courses (titled Basic, White, Red, and Blue), but only 5,000 such commissions were awarded over the 20-year history of the CMTC. Apparently, no records exist that document total participation, but it is estimated that 400,000 men had at least one summer of training.&lt;ref&gt;Kington, Donald M., ''Forgotten Summers: The Story of the Citizens' Military Training Camps, 1921–1940'', Two Decades Publishing (1995), {{ISBN|0-9645789-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among known participants were [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[Walter S. McIlhenny]], [[Chuck Yeager]], and [[William Guarnere]].

[[Camp Edwin F. Glenn]] located at [[Fort Benjamin Harrison]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10706">{{short description| Hypothetical mechanism transporting carbon from shallow continental shelf waters to the adjacent deep ocean }}
In [[ocean]]ic [[biogeochemistry]], the '''continental shelf pump''' is proposed to operate in the shallow waters of the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]], acting as a mechanism to transport [[carbon]] (as either dissolved or particulate material) from surface waters to the interior of the adjacent deep ocean.&lt;ref name=tsun99&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0889.1999.t01-2-00010.x | last1 = Tsunogai | first1 = S. | last2 = Watanabe | first2 = S. | last3 = Sato | first3 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Is there a "continental shelf pump" for the absorption of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | url = | journal = Tellus, Ser. B | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 701–712 |bibcode = 1999TellB..51..701T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Originally formulated by Tsunogai ''et al.'' (1999),&lt;ref name=tsun99/&gt; the pump is believed to occur where the [[solubility pump|solubility]] and [[biological pump|biological]] pumps interact with a local [[hydrography]] that feeds dense water from the shelf floor into sub-surface (at least [[thermocline|subthermocline]]) waters in the neighbouring deep ocean.  Tsunogai ''et al.'''s (1999)&lt;ref name=tsun99/&gt; original work focused on the [[East China Sea]], and the observation that, averaged over the year, its surface waters represented a sink for [[carbon dioxide]].  This observation was combined with others of the distribution of dissolved [[carbonate]] and [[alkalinity]] and explained as follows :

* the shallowness of the continental shelf restricts [[convection]] of cooling water
* as a consequence, cooling is greater for continental shelf waters than for neighbouring open ocean waters
* this leads to the production of relatively cool and dense water on the shelf
* the cooler waters promote the [[solubility pump]] and lead to an increased storage of dissolved inorganic carbon
* this extra carbon storage is augmented by the increased biological production characteristic of shelves&lt;ref name=woll98&gt;Wollast, R. (1998). Evaluation and comparison of the global carbon cycle in the coastal zone and in the open ocean, p. 213-252. In K. H. Brink and A. R. Robinson (eds.), ''The Global Coastal Ocean''. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the dense, carbon-rich shelf waters sink to the shelf floor and enter the sub-surface layer of the open ocean via [[isopycnal]] mixing

==Significance==
Based on their measurements of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flux over the East China Sea (35 g C m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), Tsunogai ''et al.'' (1999)&lt;ref name=tsun99/&gt; estimated that the continental shelf pump could be responsible for an air-to-sea flux of approximately 1 Gt C y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; over the world's shelf areas.

One caveat to this calculation is that the original work was concerned with the hydrography of the East China Sea, where cooling plays the dominant role in the formation of dense shelf water, and that this mechanism may not apply in other regions.  However, it has been suggested&lt;ref name=yool01&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2000GB001359 | last1 = Yool | first1 = A. | last2 = Fasham | first2 = M. J.

For instance, in polar regions, the formation of [[sea ice|sea-ice]] results in the [[extrusion]] of salt that may increase seawater density.

As sea level rose the surface area of the shelf seas grew and in consequence the strength of the shelf sea pump should increase.

'''Cumulus mediocris''' is a low to middle level cloud with some vertical extent (Family D1) of the genus [[Cumulus cloud | cumulus]], larger in vertical development than [[Cumulus humilis]].&lt;ref name="NWS"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/cloudchart#myModall2 | title=L2 Clouds: Cumulus (Cu) of moderate/strong development | author=[[National Weather Service]] | work=JetStream | publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | NOAA]] | accessdate=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also may exhibit small protuberances from the top and may show the cauliflower form characteristic of cumulus clouds. Cumulus mediocris clouds do not generally produce [[precipitation (meteorology) | precipitation]] of more than very light intensity, but can further advance into clouds such as [[Cumulus congestus]] or [[cumulonimbus cloud | Cumulonimbus]], which do produce precipitation.

Cumulus mediocris is also classified as a low cloud and is coded C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;2 by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/pubref/References/WMOcodes.html | title=Meteorological Codes | accessdate=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Cumulus mediocris is brilliantly white when sunlit, and is dark underneath.  A single pattern-based variety, Cumulus radiatus, is sometime seen when the individual clouds are arranged into parallel rows. The resulting formations are known as "cloud streets" and are aligned nearly parallel to the wind.&lt;ref name="NWS"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/cloudchart#myModall2 | title=L2 Clouds: Cumulus (Cu) of moderate/strong development | author=[[National Weather Service]] | work=JetStream | publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration | NOAA]] | accessdate=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumulus mediocris may have precipitation-based features like [[virga]], and may form Cumulus praecipitato clouds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cumulus praecipitatio |url=http://namesofclouds.com/cumulus/cumulus-praecipitatio.html |website=namesofclouds.com |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[fractus cloud|pannus]] supplementary feature is sometimes seen with precipitating Cumulus mediocris, but in this case the C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;7 reporting code normally used with to identify pannus is usually superseded by C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;2, since there is significant vertical development. ''Pileus'' (cap cloud), ''velum'' (apron), ''arcus'' (roll or shelf cloud) and ''tuba'' (vertical column) features are also occasionally seen with cumulus mediocris{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Cumulus mediocris may form as a result of a partial transformation of altocumulus or stratocumulus. This genus and species type may also be the result of a complete transformation of stratocumulus or stratus.

[[File:Cumulus mediocris.jpg|thumb|left|Cumulus mediocris clouds.]]

==Forecasting==
These clouds are common in the advance of a [[cold front]] or in unstable atmospheric conditions such as an area of low pressure. They can grow into larger Cumulus congestus which could bring rain, winds and in worse cases, thunder and lightning. If these clouds are present in the morning or early afternoon they show a significant instability in the atmosphere likely leading to storms later in the day.

==Formation==

These clouds occur when there is more rising air than the Cumulus humilis. Like any cumulus cloud, this cloud requires convection before developing. This occurs when pockets of air around them become warmer and begin to rise. As the air rises, it condenses forming a Cumulus humilis cloud as it continues to rise, a Cumulus mediocris.&lt;ref name="Wolstanton Marsh Weather Station"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wolstanton.org.uk/web_weather/web/gallery_clouds_cumulus.php#mediocris |title=Mediocris_Clouds_Wolstaton |accessdate=2014-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Desire''''' was the 120 ton flagship [[Thomas Cavendish]] built for his highly successful 1586-1588 circumnavigation of the globe. The ''Desire'' was only the third ship to circumnavigate the globe after the [[Victoria (ship)|''Victoria'']] of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] (journey completed by Juan Sebastián Elcano) and the ''[[Golden Hind]]'' of [[Francis Drake]]. After this expedition Cavendish was knighted by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] of England who was invited to a dinner aboard the ''Desire''.

The ship was later captained by [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]] on the second, unsuccessful, Cavendish expedition. On that same expedition it was the ship he captained when he probably discovered the [[Falkland Islands]]. Davis  brought the ship back, in a wretched state, to [[Castletownbere|Berehaven]] in Ireland on 14 June 1593. Only Davis and fifteen crewmen survived out of an original 76 on the ship.

Port Desire  in Patagonia was named by Cavendish in 1586 after his ship and later became known by the Spanish translation of the name, [[Puerto Deseado]].

Before his death, which occurred on the voyage home from the ill-fated second expedition, Cavendish made his will, bequeathing the ''Desire'' to [[George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon|Sir George Carey]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6309">[[File:Dropstone.JPG|thumb|300px|A dropstone of [[quartzite]] in layered [[rhythmite]] at Itu, Brazil]]
'''Dropstones''' are isolated fragments of rock found within finer-grained water-deposited [[sedimentary rock]]s. They range in size from small pebbles to boulders. The critical distinguishing feature is that there is evidence that they were not transported by normal water currents, but rather dropped in vertically through the water column.

== Background ==
When deposited into fine layered mud, such evidence includes an impact depression beneath the dropstone, and indication that the mud has been squeezed up around the edges of the falling rock. Subsequent deposits of mud drape over the dropstone and its crater. [[glacier|Glacial]] dropstones, involving rocks falling out of [[iceberg]]s, are one of the most common types of dropstone preserved in the geological record, particularly when deposited in low-energy deep sea or lake environments. Dropstones differ from [[glacial erratic|erratics]] found in glacial [[till]] in that they are deposited in a [[lake]] or marine environments. Dropstones may also be deposited by a variety of non-glacial means.

== Origin of dropstones ==
There are five natural mechanisms that produce dropstones:
[[File:IRD mcr1.JPG|thumb|333px|Glacial dropstone from [[w:Permian|Permian]] rocks in eastern Australia]]

=== Glaciers ===
As glaciers move across a surface, they pluck rocks from it, and incorporate them into their mass. At the coast, fragments of glacier detach and float away as icebergs, which are often transported ([[ice rafted]]) many miles into the ocean, where they melt and deposit their load. When entrained rocks sink to the ocean floor, they can be incorporated into the oceanic sediments, which are typically fine grained.

=== Volcanoes ===
Whilst dropstones were once thought to be diagnostic of glaciers, it has since been realised that they can also be formed via volcanic eruptions. [[Volcanic bombs]] are large fragments of rock, projected many miles by the force of an eruption. If these land in fine sediments, they can form dropstones.&lt;ref name=Bennett1994&gt;{{cite journal

However, a large blast may spread bombs far enough for them to end up in a marine setting of fine enough sediment for them to be recognised.

=== Turbidity currents ===
Dropstones can also be deposited through the action of strong ocean-floor [[turbidity current]]s.&lt;ref name=Bennett1996&gt;{{cite journal

=== Biological rafts ===
[[File:Gastroliths.jpg|thumb|150px|Examples of [[gastrolith]] dropstones from the Tropic Shale ([[Cretaceous]]) of Utah]]
Stones can also be transported large distances by becoming bound in a raft of floating plant material or in the roots of floating trees.&lt;ref name=Bennettetal1996&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When such a raft disintegrates due to waterlogging and sinking of its constituents, the transported rocks would also sink. Dropstones formed in this manner are typically associated with organic matter, especially logs – the fossilised remains of the raft that caused its transport.

Vertebrates may also act as "rafts" by ingesting [[gastrolith]]s and depositing them in standing bodies of water by regurgitation or when the organism dies.&lt;ref name="Bennettetal1996" /&gt;

=== Meteorites ===
Meteorites landing in marine depositional environments are a fifth category of dropstone.  A number of meteorites have been found in Sweden's Thorsberg quarry, where they sank to the bottom of a shallow sea and were entombed in limestone 470 million years ago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31163">A '''drought refuge''' is a site that provides permanent [[fresh water]] or moist conditions for plants and animals, acting as a [[Refuge (ecology)|refuge]] habitat when surrounding areas are affected by [[drought]] and allowing [[ecosystem]]s and core species populations to survive until the drought breaks.  Drought refuges are important for conserving ecosystems in places where the effects of climatic variability are exacerbated by human activities.

==Description==
Reliable drought refuges are characterised by the ability to retain sufficient water throughout the drought, having [[water quality]] good enough to maintain the life of the ecosystem that are not subject to physical disturbance and that have access to surrounding habitat, so that refugees can [[recolonise]] the main habitat when the drought ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ewater.com.au/drought/refuge_habitats.shtml |title=Refuge habitats |accessdate=2011-09-02 |work=Drought Science |first= |last= |publisher= eWater CRC |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[fish]] and aquatic [[invertebrate]]s a drought refuge may be an isolated permanent pool in a stream that ceases to flow and mostly dries up during a period of drought.&lt;ref name=bond&gt;Bond, N.R.

"Drought refuge is a secure place persisting through a disturbance with the critical criterion being that after the disturbance the refuge provides colonist to allow populations to recover."{{Quote without source|date=September 2018}}

For some species the refuge is their only water source and is necessary for survival.&lt;ref&gt;Lake, P. Sam ''Drought and Aquatic Ecosystems: Effects and Responses''&lt;/ref&gt; For birds and invertebrate taxa, the drought refuge is not only necessary for survival but contribute to their reproductive success. Some organisms that are able to adapt to the environment when there is a drought but adapting traits that will be beneficial for survival in a prolong drought is extremely difficult to accomplish.

==Terms ''refuge'' and ''drought''==
The term ''[[refugium (population biology)|refugium]]'' (plural: ''refugia'') was originally used by evolutionary biologists for refuges that protected entire species from disturbance events of large temporal and spatial scales, such as glaciation or the long-term effects of climate change.&lt;ref name =Robson5&gt;Robson, B. J., Chester, E. T., Mitchell, B. D., &amp; Matthews, T. G. (2013). Disturbance and the role of refuges in mediterranean climate streams. ''Hydrobiologia'', 719(1), 77–91.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] involves a temporary removal of biomass resulting in change in physical environment.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a&gt;Parkos, J. J., Ruetz, C. R., Trexler, J. C. (2011). Disturbance regime and limits on benefits of refuge use for fishes in a fluctuating hydroscape. Oikos, 120(10), 1519-1530.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller-scale [[ecologists]] now use this term synonymously with the simpler term ''[[refuge (population biology)|refuge]]'', to define places that protect populations of plants or animals from smaller-scale disturbances, such as fire, flood, storm, or human impacts.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; [[Refugium (population biology)|Refugia]] are the habitats or environmental factors that give spatial and temporal resistance and resilience to biotic communities impacted by disturbance.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a&gt;Magoulick, D. D., &amp; Kobza, R. M. (2003). The role of refugia for fishes during drought: A review and synthesis. ''Freshwater Biology'', 48, 1186–1198.&lt;/ref&gt; Here negative effects of disturbance are lower than surrounding areas or times.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Refugia buffer species long-term, where as, a refuge buffers species short-term.&lt;ref name=Kath1a&gt;Kath, J., Powell, S., Reardon-Smith, K., El Sawah, S., Jakeman, A. J., Croke, B. F. W., &amp; Dyer, F. J. (2015). Groundwater salinization intensifies drought impacts in forests and reduces refuge capacity. ''Journal of Applied Ecology'', 52, 1116–1125.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other uses of the term ''refuge'', such as for a wildlife reserve or a place free from predators (predation refuge).&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; A refuge is a place or situation that provides safety or shelter.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Here, species are minimally affected by changing climate conditions.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt;

Lack of [[precipitation]] causes drying of aquatic ecosystems and leads to a natural disturbance called a [[drought]].&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; In order for organisms to survive a drought, the disturbance must be minimal or there must be a drought refuge available.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;

==Effects of drought==
The severity of a disturbance is measured by its intensity, duration, and recovery time.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Intensity and duration influence the strength of a disturbance and the likelihood of the survival of [[organisms]] within an area.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Recovery time influences the level of recovery abundance and composition in a disturbed habitat until next [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] forces [[species]] to seek shelter.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  Disturbances, such as drought, influence [[space|spatial]] and [[Time|temporal]] patterns of refuge use, as well as the role of refuges in community dynamics.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  [[Climate variability|Variability]] in patterns of disturbance affect refuge use patterns and community structure.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  Decreased time between disturbances increases refuge usage until a certain frequency is reached and the usage declines as a result of the weakening [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] of a species.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Refuge [[Biodegradation|degradation]] increases mortality for sensitive species during larger disturbance times.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;

Droughts decrease surface area and volume, while increasing [[physical body|physical]] and [[chemical]] water quality extremes, such as, temperature levels, oxygen concentration and water levels.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; This links with interactions that structure the communities of different species and affects mortality, birth and migration rates.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; During a [[drought]], species must seek refuge or have [[adaptations]] that provide refuge.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;

Hydrological extremes, such as [[flood]] and [[drought]], modify habitats.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a&gt;Stubbington, R. (2012). The hyporheic zone as an invertebrate refuge: A review of variability in space, time, taxa and behavior. Marine and Freshwater Research, 63(4), 293-311.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Droughts]] lead to not only the loss of habitats, but also to [[isolation (habitat)|isolated]] habitat patches created by the separation of [[populations]] which together form a [[meta population]].&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Increased [[density]] of [[organisms]] is another result of droughts.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt;  Increased organism density leads to [[resource]] limitations, movement limitations, increased [[competition]], and increased [[predation]] pressure.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Droughts also cause changes in food resources and water quality.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt;

==Function and importance of drought refuges==
Drought refuges protect [[plant]] and [[animal]] populations from extreme weather events as [[climate]] trends evolve .&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bateman1&gt;Bateman, B. L., Pidgeon, A. M., Radeloff, V. C., Allstadt, A. J., Akcakaya, H., R., Thogmartin, W. E., Vavrus, S. J., &amp; Heglund, P. J. (2015). The importance of range edges for an irruptive species during extreme weather events. Landscape Ecology, 30(6), 1095-1110.&lt;/ref&gt;  They serve as places that support populations of plants and animals not able to live elsewhere in a [[landscape]] during disturbance events, whether those events are [[seasonal]] and relatively predictable, or otherwise.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; A [[habitats]] ability to act as a refuge depends on the disturbance.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt;  The ability of a refuge to [[retain]] water becomes essential for the maintenance of most populations.&lt;ref name=Humphries3&gt;Humphries, P., &amp; Baldwin, D. S. (2003). Drought and aquatic ecosystems: An introduction. Freshwater Biology, 48(7), 1141-1146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robson4&gt;Robson, B. J., &amp; Matthews, T. G. (2004). Drought refuges affect algal recolonisation in intermittent streams. River Research and Applications, 20(7), 753-763.&lt;/ref&gt; Refuges of sufficient size and duration maintain populations, sustain [[biodiversity]] and may harbour [[relict]] populations.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; They are of particular importance during increasing [[aridification]] when few other suitable habitats remain.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; [[Biota (ecology)|Biota]] depend heavily on seasonal refuges.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Refuges increase survival rate and recovery time of populations experiencing an environmental disturbance.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Refugial effectiveness is the ability of a refuge to fulfill habitat-related criteria.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt;  Knowledge of refuges in [[mediterranean]] and [[semi-arid]] streams and rivers has increased during the last decade.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;

The disturbance process and the [[Colonisation (biology)|recolonization]] process are two [[ecological]] processes which are associated with how refuges function.&lt;ref name=Chester2&gt;Chester, E. T., &amp; Robinson, B. J. (2011). Drought refuges, spatial scale and recolonisation by invertebrates in non-perennial streams. Freshwater Biology, 56(10), 2094-2104.&lt;/ref&gt; The disturbance process makes locations into refuges and the recolonization process restocks the wider [[landscape]] once a disturbance has passed.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt;   Recolonization is driven by [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]], local survival in drought refuges, or [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]], high local [[Death|mortality]] with individuals moving back to streams when conditions improve.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pires3a&gt;Pires, D. F., Pires, A. M., Collares, M. J., &amp; Magalhaes, M. F. (2010). Variation in fish assemblages across dry-season pools in a Mediterranean stream: Effects of pool morphology, physicochemical factors and spatial context. Ecology of Freshwater Fish, 19, 74-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The processes of disturbance, refuge formation, refuge function and recolonization occur at varying temporal and spatial scales.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Humphries3 /&gt;  The [[spatial distribution]] of refuges influences the usage and recolonization.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Spatial factors alone have a small contribution. Refuges vary with [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[physicochemical]] factors as well; contribution is shared.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Refuges can be small or large and can be used for short or long periods of time.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;

Refugia are relative depending on species [[adaptations]], spatial and temporal scale, and disturbance regime.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;  Many relative influences are unclear as each situation is different.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Drought refuges are important for sustaining biodiversity over larger spatial scales.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt;

[[Perennial water]]s are the most important drought refuge.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; As refuges, they require the least investment by stream [[invertebrates]] and have the greatest [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennial surface water is crucial to the survival of [[macroinvertebrate]] and [[fish]].&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Differences in [[longitude|longitudinal]] pattern affect the location and function of perennial water refuges.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;

Refuge occupancy is predictable based on [[species]]' [[Phenotypic trait|traits]], but not all suitable refuges within a system are occupied.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Refuge community structure is mostly constant because the response to a disturbance carries across a species; the same species takes advantage of the same type of refuge.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Refugia play a central role in the structuring of communities.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;  Most non-perennial stream [[taxa]] appear to have more than one potential refuge from drought.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; The primary determinant of which drought refuges a species uses in a landscape are its [[intrinsic]] traits.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt;

There are specific regions (refuges) to which individuals move during a drought, and within these regions there are specific characteristics of sites used as refuges by different species.&lt;ref name=Bateman1 /&gt; A species may use more than one type of refuge during its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; A variation in refuge use is caused by [[topography]], individual species [[susceptible individual|susceptibility]] and response to disturbance.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Patterns of refuge use are influenced by disturbance type, species type, patch size, potential occupants and location.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; These patterns are poorly understood.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt;

Drought refuges form [[patch dynamics|habitat mosaics]] which are prone to increased [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] by flow regulation.&lt;ref name=Robson4 /&gt; Some mosaics are more vulnerable to water [[abstraction]] than others.&lt;ref name=Robson4 /&gt; The drying of pools results in a patchy mosaic of pools in a dry channel which vary in suitability for different species and life stages.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Different species favor different sized pools in different locations with different [[physicochemical]] properties.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Refuges with low abundance of species require less effort to be adequate than diverse refuges.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; The size of a pool influences the set of species, total number of organisms, and assembly structure because of physicochemical factors.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; [[Species richness]] and [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]] are related to pool [[morphology (biology)|morphology]].&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; [[Shade (shadow)|Shade]], [[location (geography)|location]], and [[soil]] composition are all contributing factors.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Heavily shaded pools have colder water, where as lightly shaded pools have increased levels of primary productivity.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Large refuges have increased abundance and enrichment and are likely to persist through long disturbances.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt;

While used infrequently and often containing only few individuals during normal years, range edges may episodically serve as refuges from extreme weather events or conditions such as drought.&lt;ref name=Bateman1 /&gt; During these extreme conditions, survival probability, [[reproductive success]] or both is higher at the edge than in the core of its range.&lt;ref name=Bateman1 /&gt;

Refuge use is influenced by habitat characteristics, such as hydrolic exchange and [[sediment]] type, active [[Animal migration|migration]] or passive habitat use and species morphology, [[behaviour]] and [[physiology]].&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; A decline in refuge use is due to decreased effectiveness of mortality reduction and reduced time provided for community recovery which leads to reduced time between disturbances.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;

Movement into and out of refuge creates predictable fluxes of [[biomass]] and [[nutrients]].&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  This is important in [[food web]]s and the [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  A dense amount of nutrients in one location during a disturbance means increased [[competition]] and [[predation]].&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;  Rates of mortality, [[birth]], migration, and interactions among components of the biota that have retreated to refugia are affected by the nature of the refuge.&lt;ref name=Humphries3 /&gt; The spatial extent, the rate of drying, and the ambient [[physical body|physical]] and [[chemical]] conditions are all contributors.&lt;ref name=Humphries3 /&gt;

Drought refuges for [[algae]] are wide- spread because most med-river [[taxa]] can survive [[desiccation]] and show little specificity for refuges, provided drying occurs slowly.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; They include dry [[biofilm]] on stones and wood, dry leaf packs and [[perennial]] pools.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Refuges for [[macrophytes]] and [[zooplankton]] typically comprise egg and seed banks in med-rivers and are resilient to prolonged drying.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;

==Importance of Refuge Connectivity==

&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt;[[Drought]] leads to a shift in refuge spacing and connections at different spatial and temporal scales.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; Droughts disrupt hydrological connectivity and impact resident species through loss of water and flow from drying, habitat reduction, and reconfiguration.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Delivery of water is restricted to areas within a stream network.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Habitat patches engineered by members of community serve as refuges that are crucial for other members.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt; Trails and ponds dug by certain species, like [[alligators]], allow for dispersal into refuges.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; Hydrolic exchange provides movement of [[water]], [[nutrients]], and organisms into a refuge.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Populations of [[sessility (motility)|sessile]] organisms, like [[flora and fauna]] in perennial water refuges, cannot persist indefinitely without hydrological connections among refuges.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Mobile organisms, like fish, will move into a refugia if there are no barriers, like physical obstructions (ex: [[dams]], isolated pools), biotic factors (ex: predation, competition), and physicochemical factors (ex: low dissolved oxygen levels).

&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; During smaller scale, shorter term disturbances, populations within refuges are not necessarily cut off from those in other refuges or those in other undisturbed [[landscapes]], and so [[genetic exchange]] can still occur, or will occur during parts of the life cycle not constrained by the disturbance. Under those circumstances, the survival of a species is unlikely to depend upon a single refuge.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Recovery processes need to restore connectivity, so that [[Animal migration|migration]] can occur from refuges to new patches of habitat.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennially flowing streams may act as drought refuges for neighboring streams, even if they are not hydro logically connected to them.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Refugees must be connected hydrologically at the appropriate times. For [[insects]], refuges on one stream may support recolonization on adjacent streams that are not hydro logically connected, which may also necessitate conservation planning across catchment boundaries.

The drought from 1996 until 2009 had a great impact on the Murray-Darling Basin, in Northern Australia (Murphy and Timbal 2007; Umenhofer et al. 2009). When this drought occurred, it dried the wetlands and water storages (the drought refuge). For many species of birds and fish, the refuge is the only freshwater available. The body of water serves as food and shelter; therefore, it must be conserved. Drought refuges are likely to sustain biodiversity over larger spatial scales such as groups of streams or whole drainage networks. Chester, E. T. and Robson, B. J. (2011), Drought refuges, spatial scale and recolonization by invertebrates in non-perennial streams. Freshwater Biology, 56: 2094–2104.

==Different Types of Drought Refuge==

&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; A [[species]] may use more than one type of refuge during its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Refugia can be physical characteristics of organisms like short-term [[behavior]] or a long-term evolutionary [[adaptation]].&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;[[Animals]] and [[plants]] have mechanisms to increase resistance (survival) and resilience (recovery) to physical disturbance.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; They develop adaptations like [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[physiology]], [[behavior]].&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Physical organism adaptations include an ability to [[aestivate]], mouth orientation that allows for breathing oxygen at the water surface, body armor, and venomous spines.&lt;ref name=Parkos2a /&gt;[[Motion (physics)|Mobile]] species' coping methods include refuge-seeking behavior; they seek [[habitat]] patches that relieve physiological stress and reduce mortality.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Reliance on dispersal improves resilience to climate change in the short term, but over longer timescales, it will not protect macro [[invertebrate]] [[biodiversity]] from landscape-scale refuge degradation.

&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; The [[hyporheic zone]], a region along streambeds where groundwater mixes with surface water.&lt;ref name=Robson4 /&gt; It is an important refuge for immobile organisms, like [[algae]].&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; The hyporheic zone protects from freezing, high temperature, and [[pollution]].&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; It reduces displacement, with its relatively stable, slow flow.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; In a hyporheic zone, free water is retained, and invertebrates remain submerged.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; The hyporheic zone has been shown to contribute colonists when surface flows recommence.

&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Perennial waters, whether pools, seeps or flowing sections of streams, have repeatedly been shown to be the major refuges.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennially flowing stream sections and perennial pools act as drought refuges for a wider area of the landscape than the stream on which they are located.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Refuges of a size sufficient to maintain whole [[populations]], such as perennially flowing reaches, are likely to be most important and may, during [[aridification]], become refugia containing relictual populations.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennial pools and perennially flowing water generally harbor the greatest diversity of macro invertebrate [[taxa]] because they require the least investment by the invertebrates.

==Threats and conservation==
Because [[drought]] refuges may provide the only sites allowing populations to persist during droughts, they are highly vulnerable to factors that affect water quality such as [[water pollution]] and [[sedimentation]] from [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] [[surface runoff|runoff]].  Consequently, in areas subject to intermittent drought, [[habitat conservation]] requires the identification and protection of drought refuges.&lt;ref name=bond/&gt;

&lt;ref name=Humphries3 /&gt;Drought is specific to certain regions and climatic zones.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt;[[Climate change]] in many med-regions may prolong dry periods and threaten refuges.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; The capacity for perennial refuges to support [[biodiversity]] may be severely compromised due to increasing water temperatures, reducing the quality of refuges by exceeding the thermal tolerance of [[invertebrates]] or by causing [[anoxic waters|anoxia]] in stream pools and existing environmental degradation of many [[perennial]] water-ways.

Droughts have the ability to reduce agriculture products and be the cause loss of crops and lives. Hence, reserving the refuge is of extreme importance in more ways than one. In order to conserve the drought refuge for these species, action needs to be taken that will effect short term and long term impacts that the drought have on the species that dwell on it for survival. In California, efforts to conserve the drought refuge there, include reserving water when possible. Water conservation is done in order to migrating bird populations (National Wildlife Refuge; March, 1, 2016). The National wildlife refuge also takes part in mowing, disking, spraying and controlled burns. These measures are taken in an effort to stop non-native vegetation from growing; this type of vegetation typically out grows the native when in drought. Thus, allowing for native vegetation to survive during drought, leading to the dependent species to forage on the available vegetation. The clean water act was passed in order to protect the American waters from pollution. Although the act does not protect all waters, it protects many bodies of water. When drought refuges are polluted, they become an even greater danger for the dwelling species. The clean water act is just one step in cleaning waters, and saving drought refuges "(The Clean Water Rule; National Wildlife Organization)."

Continuous threats to the drought refuge conservation include; sedimentation, waterhole pumping, and the lack of the structure of the water, it is not near any other bodies of water. These of course, lead to situations where there is an extreme decrease in water availability. As water availability decreases, it increases the chances for dependent species to die out.

&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Groundwater [[aquifers]] support drought refuges for water-dependent ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt;[[Pollution]] and over-extraction of [[groundwater]] are both problematic because it lowers its ability to support groundwater-supplied drought refuges.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Over-extraction lowers the [[water table]] and degrades water-dependent [[ecosystems]].&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Over-extraction often occurs in areas with surface [[water scarcity]] and frequent drought; where groundwater refuges and refugia are most important.&lt;ref name=Magoulick4a /&gt; Man-made disturbances can mimic the effects of drought, like water withdrawal, and dams.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; Man-made channel modifications threaten the [[hyporheic zone]] as a refuge.

&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Groundwater [[Salinity|salinization]] compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance,  along with [[irrigation]], causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses [[species]] not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing [[photosynthesis]]. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts.

&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; There needs to be an increased focus on conservation efforts.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Knowledge of refuge functions is critical for understanding their role in conservation of [[biodiversity]], especially climatically sensitive species.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Especially in regions where climate change is increasing the frequency and duration of dry periods.&lt;ref name=Pires3a /&gt; To best conserve species facing extreme weather events, it is necessary to identify conditions ‘pushing’ species, and, more importantly, to identify the refuge sites to which individuals move.&lt;ref name=Chester2 /&gt; Perennially flowing streams and perennial pools may be crucially important for sustaining biodiversity within a mosaic of stream habitats with drier flow regimes.&lt;ref name=Bateman1 /&gt; The primary emphasis of drought refuge protection should be on protecting perennial surface waters and range edges within that landscape.&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Conservation approaches for river systems will need to focus on identifying and conserving refuges together with maintaining refuge connectivity, reducing the impacts of other disturbances on these systems, and sustaining predictable seasonal flow patterns.

&lt;ref name=Robson5 /&gt; Releases from hydroelectricity reservoirs could be used to lower river water temperatures or replenish reaches of formerly perennial flow, thereby creating refuges for river biota.&lt;ref name=Stubbington5a /&gt; Also, focusing on maintaining groundwater quality is more beneficial than focusing on surface water resources.&lt;ref name=Kath1a /&gt; Re-vegetation can reduce water [[pollution]] in ground and surface water, benefitting biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Robson5" /&gt; There is increasing evidence that habitats created by humans, such as canals, ditches, and farm ponds can support freshwater biodiversity and, therefore, have potential to provide refuges.&lt;ref name="Parkos2a" /&gt; They can prevent larger organisms, like fish, from becoming stranded as water levels decrease.&lt;ref name="Robson5" /&gt; While the preservation of refuges is crucial to provide recolonization sources, it is not sufficient if colonists cannot get from the refuge to habitat patches suitable for colonization.

Conversely, where management of pest species is necessary, controlling them in their drought refuges during droughts may be more cost-effective than broad-scale control at other times.

'''Earth tide''' (also known as '''solid Earth tide''', '''crustal tide''', '''body tide''', '''bodily tide''' or '''land tide''') is the displacement of the [[solid earth]]'s surface caused by the [[gravity]] of the [[Moon]] and [[Sun]]. Its main component has meter-level amplitude at periods of about 12 hours and longer.  The largest body tide constituents are semi-[[diurnal cycle|diurnal]], but there are also significant diurnal, semi-annual, and fortnightly contributions.
Though the gravitational forcing causing earth tides and ocean [[tides]] is the same, the responses are quite different.

==Tide raising force==

}}
The larger of the periodic gravitational forces is from the Moon but that of the Sun is also important.
The images here show lunar [[tidal force]] when the Moon appears directly over 30° N (or 30° S). This pattern remains fixed with the red area directed toward (or directly away from) the Moon. Red indicates upward pull, blue downward. If, for example the Moon is directly over  90° W (or 90° E), the red areas are centred on the western northern hemisphere, on upper right.  Red up, blue down.  If for example the Moon is directly over 90° W  (90° E), the centre of the red area is 30° N, 90° W and 30° S, 90° E, and the centre of the bluish band follows the [[great circle]] equidistant from those points.  At 30° latitude a strong peak occurs once per lunar day, giving a significant diurnal force at that latitude. Along the equator two equally sized peaks (and depressions) are equally sized, giving semi-diurnal force there.

The Earth tide encompasses the entire body of the Earth and is unhindered by the thin [[crust (geology)|crust]] and land masses of the surface, on scales that make the rigidity of rock irrelevant. Ocean tides are a consequence of the resonance of the same driving forces with water movement periods in [[ocean basin]]s accumulated over many days, so that their amplitude and timing are quite different and vary over short distances of just a few hundred km. The oscillation periods of the earth as a whole are not near the astronomical periods, so its flexing is due to the forces of the moment.

The tide components with a period near twelve hours have a lunar amplitude (earth bulge/depression distances) that are a little more than twice the height of the solar amplitudes, as tabulated below. At new and full moon, the Sun and the Moon are aligned, and the lunar and the solar tidal maxima and minima (bulges and depressions) add together for the greatest tidal range at particular latitudes. At first- and third-quarter phases of the moon, lunar and solar tides are perpendicular, and the tidal range is at a minimum. The semi-diurnal tides go through one full cycle (a high and low tide) about once every 12 hours and one full cycle of maximum height (a spring and neap tide) about once every 14 days.

The development of a systematic theory of Earth tides was started by [[George H. Darwin]] in 1879,&lt;ref&gt;
[[George H. Darwin|G. H. Darwin]], ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''170''', 447-530, 1879&lt;/ref&gt; and was then furthered by numerous authors, most notably by William Kaula in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;
[[William M. Kaula|W. M. Kaula]], ''Reviews of Geophysics'', '''2''', 661-684, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

The semi-diurnal tide (one maximum every 12 or so hours) is primarily lunar (only ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is purely solar) and gives rise to ''sectorial'' deformations which rise and fall at the same time along the same longitude.&lt;ref&gt;
Paul Melchior, "Earth Tides", ''Surveys in Geophysics'', '''1''', pp. 275–303, March, 1974.
&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Sectorial harmonics|Sectorial]]'' variations of vertical and east-west displacements are maximum at the equator and vanish at the poles. There are two cycles along each latitude, the bulges opposite one another, and the depressions similarly opposed.
The diurnal tide is lunisolar, and gives rise to ''[[tesseral harmonics|tesseral]]'' deformations. The vertical and east-west movement is maximum at 45° latitude and is zero on the equator and at the poles.
Tesseral variation have one cycle per latitude, one bulge and one depression; the bulges are opposed (antipodal), that is to say the western part of the northern hemisphere and the eastern part of the southern hemisphere, for example, and similarly the depressions are opposed, the eastern part of the northern hemisphere and the western part of the southern hemisphere, in this case.
Finally, fortnightly and semi-annual tides have ''[[zonal harmonics|zonal]]'' deformations (constant along a circle of latitude), as the Moon or Sun gravitation is directed alternately away from the northern and southern hemispheres due to tilt. There is zero vertical displacement at 35°16' latitude.

Since these displacements affect the [[vertical direction]] east-west and north-south variations are often tabulated in [[arc seconds|milliarcseconds]] for [[astronomical]] use.  The vertical displacement is frequent tabulated in [[Gal (unit)|μgal]], since the gradient of gravity is  location dependent so that the distance conversion is only approximately 3 μgal per cm

==Other Earth tide contributors==
In coastal areas because the ocean tide is quite out of step with the earth tide, at high ocean tide there is an excess (or at low tide a deficit) of water about what would be the gravitational equilibrium level and the adjacent ground falls (or rises) in response to the resulting differences in weight. Displacements caused by ocean tidal loading can exceed the displacements due to the earth body tide. Sensitive instruments far inland often have to make similar corrections. Atmospheric loading and storm events may also be measurable, though the masses in movement are less weighty.

Volcanologists use the regular, predictable Earth tide movements to calibrate and test sensitive volcano deformation monitoring instruments. The tides may also trigger volcanic events.

Body tides in planets and moons, as well as in binary stars and binary asteroids, play a key role in long-term dynamics of planetary systems. For example, it is due to body tides in the Moon that it is captured into the 1:1 spin-orbit resonance (and is always showing us one side). Owing to the body tides in it, Mercury is trapped in the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance with the Sun.

For the same reason, it is believed that many of the exoplanets are captured in higher spin-orbit resonances with their host stars.

{{wiktionary|Earthling}}

'''Earthling''', a term identifying inhabitants of the planet [[Earth]]. Earthlings are the only form of life in the universe whose existence is known. Similar terms are '''Terran''' and '''Gaian'''.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==History==
Historically, the term "earthling" referred to a mortal inhabitant of the Earth as opposed to spiritual or divine entities.  In [[Early Modern English]], the word was used with the intention of contrasting "earth" with "[[heaven]]", and so presenting man as an inhabitant of the [[sublunary sphere]], as opposed to heavenly creatures or [[deity|deities]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Nashe]], ''Christ's Tears'' (1593, 1613), p. 124: "Wee (of all earthlings) are Gods vtmost subiects.";&lt;br&gt; Drummond of Hawthornden, ''Poems'' (1711), p. 31 (written ca. 1630): "Nature gaz'd on with such a curious eye, That earthlings oft her deem'd a deity."&lt;br&gt; Cited after ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The derivation from the noun ''[[:wikt:earth|earth]]'' by means of the suffix ''[[:wikt:-ling|-ling]]'' is already seen in [[Old English]] ''yrþling'', in the meaning "ploughman". The sense of "inhabitant of earth" is first attested in the 1590s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=earthling |title=earthling |last1= Harper |first1=Douglas |accessdate=18 August 2018 |work=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use in science fiction dates to 1949, in ''[[Red Planet (novel)|Red Planet]]'' by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].

The word "Human" has the same imposed meaning, since it originates from a [[PIE]] word ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ǵʰmṓ|*ǵʰmṓ]]'' "earthling" &lt; ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/dʰéǵʰōm|*dʰéǵʰōm]]'' "earth". Compare [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:homo|homo]]'' "human" and ''[[wikt:humus|humus]]'' "earth, soil".{{or|date=April 2018}}

==Modern use==
Its modern use in science fiction literature contrasts "Earth" (the planet) with outer space or hypothetical other planets with sapient life. The term was often used in 1950s science fiction film and novels by aliens to express a disdainful or patronizing tone towards creatures from Earth. The meaning "creature from planet Earth" in the context of space travel may be extended to non-human species, as in "Russia fetes dog [[Laika]], first earthling in space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/04/11/us-russia-space-dog-idUSL1117596720080411 |title=Russia fetes dog Laika, first earthling in space |last1= Solovyov |first1=Dmitry |last2= Pearce |first2=Tim (ed.) |date=11 April 2008 |publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary effect aimed for is a [[distancing effect]], inviting the readers to contemplate their own species as it might be seen from an external point of view. There is also a belittling effect, in parallel with the use of the -ling suffix in such diminutives as "duckling" and "gosling". Especially in 1950s science fiction, use of the term is a conscious reversal of common assumptions of [[anthropocentrism]] or [[human exceptionalism]], and may be an example of an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]].{{or|date=April 2018}}

In some science fiction media (such as the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise and the 2014 movie ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'') the term "Terran" is used as a term for humans, stemming from "terra", the Latin word for Earth. In the original run of the [[BBC]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the phrase "tellurian" is used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20412">'''Ecological traps''' are scenarios in which rapid [[environmental change]] leads organisms to prefer to settle in poor-quality [[habitat]]s.
The concept stems from the idea that organisms that are actively selecting [[habitat]] must rely on environmental cues to help them identify high-quality habitat.  If either the habitat quality or the cue changes so that one does not reliably indicate the other, organisms may be lured into poor-quality habitat.

== Overview ==
Ecological traps are thought to occur when the attractiveness of a habitat increases disproportionately in relation to its value for survival and reproduction. The result is preference of falsely attractive habitat and a general avoidance of high-quality but less-attractive habitats. For example, [[Indigo bunting]]s typically nest in shrubby habitat or broken forest transitions between closed canopy forest and open field. Human activity can create 'sharper', more abrupt forest edges and buntings prefer to nest along these edges. However, these artificial sharp forest edges also concentrate the movement of predators which predate their nests. In this way, Buntings prefer to nest in highly altered habitats where their nest success is lowest.&lt;ref name=weldon05/&gt;

While the demographic consequences of this type of maladaptive habitat selection behavior have been explored in the context of the sources and sinks, ecological traps are an inherently behavioral phenomenon of individuals.&lt;ref name=robertson06&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robertson |first=B.A. |authorlink= |author2=Hutto, R.L. |year=2006 |title=A framework for understanding ecological traps and an evaluation of existing evidence |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=87 |issue=5 |pages=1075–1085 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1075:AFFUET]2.0.CO;2 |pmid=16761584 |issn=0012-9658|url=http://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1275&amp;context=biosci_pubs }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite being a behavioural mechanism, ecological traps can have far-reaching population consequences for species with large dispersal capabilities, such as the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) &lt;ref name=lamb17&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lamb |first=C.T.. |authorlink= |author2=Mowat, G. |author3=McLellan, B.N. |author4=Nielsen, S.E. |author5=Boutin, S. |year=2017 |title=Forbidden fruit: human settlement and abundant fruit create an ecological trap for an apex omnivore |journal=[[Journal of Animal Ecology]]  |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=55–65 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12589|pmid= |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecological trap concept was introduced in 1972 by Dwernychuk and Boag&lt;ref name=dwernychuk72&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dwernychuk |first=L.W. |authorlink= |author2=Boag, D.A. |year=1972 |title=Ducks nesting in association with gulls-an ecological trap? |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Zoology]] |volume=50 |pages=559–563 |doi=10.1139/z72-076 |issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the many studies that followed suggested that this trap phenomenon may be widespread because of anthropogenic habitat change.&lt;ref name=robertson06/&gt;&lt;ref name=schlaepfer02&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schlaepfer |first=M.A. |authorlink= |author2=Runge, M.C. |author3=Sherman, P.W. |year=2002 |title=Ecological and evolutionary traps |journal=[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume=17 |pages=474–480 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02580-6 |issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=battin04&gt;{{cite journal |last=Battin |first=J. |authorlink= |year=2004 |title=When good animals love bad habitats: Ecological traps and the conservation of animal populations |journal=[[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] |volume=18 |issue= 6|pages=1482–1491 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00417.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a corollary, novel environments may represent fitness opportunities that are unrecognized by native species if high-quality habitats lack the appropriate cues to encourage settlement; these are known as [[perceptual trap]]s.&lt;ref name=Patten&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patten | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Kelly | first2 = J.F. | year = 2010 | title = Habitat selection and the perceptual trap | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 20 | issue = 8| pages = 2148–56 | doi = 10.1890/09-2370.1 | pmid = 21265448 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical&lt;ref name=delibes01&gt;{{cite journal |last=Delibes |first=M. |authorlink= |author2=Gaona, P. |author3=Ferreras, P. |year=2001 |title=Effects of an attractive sink leading into maladaptive habitat selection |journal=[[American Naturalist]] |volume=158 |pages=277–285 |doi=10.1086/321319 |pmid=18707324 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Donovan and Thompson 2001, Kokko and Sutherland 2001 --&gt; and empirical studies&lt;ref name=weldon05&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weldon |first=A.J. |authorlink= |author2=Haddad, N.M. |year=2005 |title=The effects of patch shape on Indigo Buntings: Evidence for an ecological trap |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=86 |pages=1422–1431 |doi=10.1890/04-0913 |issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dwernychuk72/&gt;&lt;!-- Robertson and Hutto 2007 --&gt; have shown that errors made in judging habitat quality can lead to population declines or extinction. Such mismatches are not limited to habitat selection, but may occur in any behavioral context (e.g. predator avoidance, mate selection, navigation, foraging site selection, etc.). Ecological traps are thus a subset of the broader phenomena of evolutionary traps.&lt;ref name=schlaepfer02/&gt;

As ecological trap theory developed, researchers have recognized that traps may operate on a variety of spatial and temporal scales which might also hinder their detection.  For example, because a bird must select habitat on several scales (a habitat patch, an individual territory within that patch, as well as a nest site within the territory), traps may operate on any one of these scales.&lt;ref name=misenhelter00&gt;{{cite journal |last=Misenhelter |first=M.D. |authorlink= |author2=Rotenberry, J.T. |year=2000 |title=Choices and consequences of habitat occupancy and nest site selection in sage sparrows |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=81 |pages=2892–2901 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[2892:CACOHO]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0012-9658 |issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, traps may operate on a temporal scale so that an altered environment may appear to cause a trap in one stage of an organism’s life, yet have positive effects on later life stages.&lt;ref name=schlaepfer02/&gt; As a result, there has been a great deal of uncertainty as to how common traps may be, despite widespread acceptance as a theoretical possibility.&lt;ref name=robertson06/&gt; However, given the accelerated rate of ecological change driven by human land-use change, global warming, exotic species invasions, and changes in ecological communities resulting from species loss, ecological traps may be an increasing and highly underappreciated threat to biodiversity.

A 2006 review of the literature on ecological traps provides guidelines for demonstrating the existence of an ecological trap.&lt;ref name=robertson06/&gt; A study must show a preference for one habitat over another (or equal preference) and that individuals selecting the preferred habitat (or equally preferred habitat) have lower fitness (i.e., experience lower survival or reproductive success).  Since the publication of that paper which found only a few well-documented examples of ecological traps, interest in ecological and evolutionary traps has grown very rapidly and new empirical examples are being published at an accelerating rate. There are now roughly 30 examples of ecological traps affecting a broad diversity of taxa including birds, mammals, arthropods, fish and reptiles.

Because ecological and evolutionary traps are still very poorly understood phenomena, many questions about their proximate and ultimate causes as well as their ecological consequences remain unanswered. Are traps simply an inevitable consequence of the inability of evolution to anticipate novelty or react quickly to rapid environmental change? How common are traps? Do ecological traps necessarily lead to population declines or extinctions or is it possible that they may persist indefinitely? Under what ecological and evolutionary conditions should this occur? Are organisms with certain characteristics predisposed to being "trapped"? Is rapid environmental change necessary to trigger traps? Can global warming, pollution or exotic invasive species create traps? Embracing genetic and phylogenetic approaches may provide more robust answers to the above questions as well as providing deeper insight into the proximate and ultimate basis for maladaptation in general{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- (see Crespi 2000) --&gt;. Because ecological and evolutionary traps are predicted to add in concert with other sources of population decline, traps are an important research priority for conservation scientists. Given the rapid current rate of global environmental change, traps may be far more common than it is realized and it will be important to examine the proximate and ultimate causes of traps if management is to prevent or eliminate traps in the future.

==Polarized light pollution==
[[Polarized light pollution]] is perhaps the most compelling and well-documented cue triggering ecological traps.&lt;ref&gt;Horvath et al., in press as of Jan, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Orientation to polarized sources of light is the most important mechanism that guides at least 300 species of [[dragonflies]], [[mayflies]], [[caddisflies]], [[Tabanidae|tabanid flies]], [[diving beetle]]s, [[Heteroptera#.22Waterbug.22|water bugs]], and other [[aquatic insect]]s in their search for the water bodies they require for suitable feeding/breeding habitat and [[oviposition]] sites (Schwind 1991; Horváth and Kriska 2008). Because of their strong linear polarization signature, artificial polarizing surfaces (e.g., asphalt, gravestones, cars, plastic sheeting, oil pools, windows) are commonly mistaken for bodies of water (Horváth and Zeil 1996; Kriska et al. 1998, 2006a, 2007, 2008; Horváth et al. 2007, 2008). Light reflected by these surfaces is often more highly polarized than that of light reflected by water, and artificial polarizers can be even more attractive to polarotactic aquatic insects than a water body (Horváth and Zeil 1996; Horváth et al. 1998; Kriska et al. 1998) and appear as exaggerated water surfaces acting as supernormal optical stimuli. Consequently, dragonflies, mayflies, caddisflies, and other water-seeking species actually prefer to mate, settle, swarm, and oviposit upon these surfaces than available water bodies.

[[File:Kathodestraalbuis2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Electron gun from an [[oscilloscope]] CRT]]
[[File:Vidicon Electron Gun.jpg|thumb|The electron gun from an [[RCA]] [[Vidicon]] [[video camera tube]].]]
An '''electron gun''' (also called '''electron emitter''') is an electrical component in some [[vacuum tube]]s that produces a narrow, [[collimation|collimated]] [[electron beam]] that has a precise [[kinetic energy]].  The largest use is in [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs), used in nearly all [[television set]]s, [[computer display]]s and [[oscilloscope]]s that are not flat-panel displays. They are also used in [[field emission display|field emission displays (FEDs)]], which are essentially flat-panel displays made out of rows of extremely small cathode ray tubes. They are also used in microwave linear beam [[vacuum tube]]s such as [[klystron]]s, [[inductive output tube]]s, [[travelling wave tube]]s, and [[gyrotron]]s, as well as in scientific instruments such as [[electron microscope]]s and [[particle accelerators]].
Electron guns may be classified by the type of electric field generation (DC or RF), by emission mechanism ([[thermionic emission|thermionic]],  [[photocathode]], [[field electron emission|cold emission]], [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] source), by focusing (pure electrostatic or with magnetic fields), or by the number of electrodes.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Electron Gun with Wehnelt Cylinder.svg|thumb|250px|right|Setup of an electron gun with:&lt;br /&gt;
➀ [[Hot cathode]]&lt;br /&gt;
➁ [[Wehnelt cylinder]]&lt;br /&gt;
➂ Anode
]]
[[Image:Ekanoner.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Electron gun from a [[travelling wave tube]], cutaway through axis to show construction]]
A direct current, electrostatic thermionic electron gun is formed from several parts: a [[hot cathode]], which is heated to create a stream of [[electrons]] via [[thermionic emission]], electrodes generating an [[electric field]] which focus the beam (such as a [[Wehnelt cylinder]]), and one or more [[anode]] electrodes which accelerate and further focus the electrons. A large voltage between the cathode and anode accelerates the electrons. A repulsive ring placed between them focuses the electrons onto a small spot on the anode at the expense of a lower extraction field strength on the cathode surface. Often at this spot is a hole so that the electrons that pass through the anode form a collimated beam and finally reach a second anode called a collector. This arrangement is similar to an [[Einzel lens]].

Most color [[cathode ray tubes]] – such as those used in [[color television]]s – incorporate three electron guns, each one producing a different stream of electrons. Each stream travels through a [[shadow mask]] where the electrons will impinge upon either a [[RGB colour model|red, green or blue]] [[phosphor]] to light up a color [[pixel]] on the screen. The resultant color that is seen by the viewer will be a combination of these three [[primary color]]s.

==Applications of electron guns==

The most common use of electron guns is in [[cathode ray tube]]s, which were widely used in computer and television monitors. An [[electron]] gun can also be used to [[ionize]] particles by adding or removing electrons from an [[atom]]. This technology is sometimes used in [[mass spectrometry]] in a process called [[electron ionization]] to ionize [[vaporized]] or [[gaseous]] particles. More powerful electron guns are used for welding, metal coating, [[Electron-beam additive manufacturing|3D metal printer]]s, metal powder production and vacuum furnaces.

Electron guns are also used in medical linac, where high energy electron beams, hit a target and emit [[X-rays]].

==Measurement and detection==
A [[nanocoulombmeter]] in combination with a [[Faraday cup]] can be used
to detect and measure the beams emitted from electron gun and [[ion gun]]s.

Another way to detect electron beams from an electron gun is by using a [[phosphor]] screen
which will glow when struck by an electron.

[[File:Näitus "Müstiline ürgmeri".jpg|thumb|Exhibition "The Secrets of Ancient Sea" in Estonian Museum of Natural History]]
The '''Estonian Museum of Natural History''' ('''Eesti Loodusmuuseum''' in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]) is the [[Estonia]]n national museum for [[natural history]]. It is situated in [[Vanalinn|Tallinn's Old Town]].

The museum focuses on natural history and nature education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.loodusmuuseum.ee/muuseumist/ |title=Muuseumist - Eesti Loodusmuuseum |language=et|website=Loodusmuuseum.ee |date= |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering its visitors a tour in the wilderness of Estonia. The exhibition space consists of permanent exhibition and temporary showcases.

== History ==
The foundation of the Estonian Museum of Natural History was laid by naturalists of the 19th century. The history of the museum goes back to an earlier museum, [[Estonian Literary Museum|that of the Estonian Literary Society]] which was founded in 1842. This museum was active in exploring [[Natural Science|the natural sciences]], an area that increased in significance at the museum in 1872 when [[Alexander von der Pahlen]] (1820–1895) began to contribute to the collection. [[Pahlen]] was later elected chairman and under his leadership the collection continued to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.loodusmuuseum.ee/en/history|title=History – Estonian Museum of Natural History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.loodusmuuseum.ee|language=en|archive-url=http://www.loodusmuuseum.ee/en/history|archive-date=2017-10-11|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It soon became apparent that a separate museum for natural history was needed. The collection was kept and displayed in a temporary building until 1911 when a building was purchased in Kohtu Street in Tallinn. The new Provincial Museum exhibited the art and natural sciences collection of the entire province of [[Harju County|Harjumaa]].

The collection was under threat of damage during the [[First World War]] so it was moved to [[Russia]] for safe keeping and returned when the war ended.

The Provincial Museum continued to operate under the Arts and Heritage Department of the [[Ministry of Education|Minister of Education and Research]] but changed its name back to The Estonian Literary Society in 1926.

After the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], Baltic-German institutions, including the Estonian Literary Society, were closed. In 1940, through the Regulation of the Council of People’s Commissars of the Estonian SSR, the Soviet authorities nationalized all museums allowing for a National Museum of Natural History to be established in Tallinn on January 1, 1941 .&lt;ref name="loodusmuuseum1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loodusmuuseum.ee/muuseumist/history/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314220847/http://www.loodusmuuseum.ee/muuseumist/history/ |archivedate=2015-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
The collections of the Estonian Museum of Natural History contain nearly 300 000 museum specimens. Approximately 90% of the plant, beetle, butterfly and moth, bird and mammal species found in Estonia are represented in the collections. A highly valuable part of the collections is made up by type specimens – the specimens used to provide the first description of a new [[taxon]] and serving as a definitive example of that taxon.

=== Botanical ===
The principal botanical collection contains approximately 108,000 plant specimens.

The vascular plant herbarium includes 79,000 specimens, of which 77,000 are [[Leaf|leaves]], and the rest [[fruit]]s, [[seed]]s, and [[Strobilus|strobili]].

Most of the material was collected in [[Estonia]], and the collection contains specimens of a predominant part of the domestic flora - 1,600 taxons.

=== Mycological collections ===
The mycological herbarium includes approximately 2,450 plant specimens. The unlichenized fungi collection contains 250 samples. Of the more than 2,200 specimens included in the [[lichen]] i.e. lichenized fungi collection, approximately 1,600 were collected in Estonia and 600 from abroad (mainly [[Scandinavia]] and other parts of [[Europe]]).

=== Zoological ===
The [[Zoology|zoological]] collections of the Museum of Natural History contain approximately 130,000 specimens. The collections boast a wide selection of both [[vertebrate]] and [[invertebrate]] species from Estonia as well as other parts of the world.

The zoological collections include:
* The [[Ornithology|ornithological]] collections
* The [[mammal]] collection
* The species-rich collection of [[Mollusca|mollusk]] shells, [[coral]]s, and [[echinoderm]]s
* The wet specimen collection
* The [[Entomology|entomological]] collections

=== Geological ===
The [[Geology|geological]] collection of the Museum of Natural History holds approximately 3,500 samples. Nearly three fourths of the specimens constitute '''paleontological material''', the oldest specimens of which were collected in the mid-19th century. The dominant part of the '''paleontological collection''' is formed by Paleozoic fossils found in the Estonian bedrock. The most numerous samples among the preserved material include fossils of marine invertebrates from the [[Ordovician]] and [[Silurian]] Periods. '''The paleontological collections''' furthermore contain bone fractions and skeletal fragments of mammals of the [[Quaternary|Quaternary Period]], most of which originate from [[Russia|Russia’s]] northern territories. '''Lithological collections''' hold typical [[sedimentary rock]]s of the Estonian bedrock: [[limestone]], [[marl]], [[sandstone]], and [[mudstone]]. '''Petrological collections''' are small, with the main specimens being Estonian [[glacial erratic]] samples and samples of [[metamorphic rock]]s and [[igneous rock]]s collected from the territory of the former Soviet Union. The number of the Museum’s '''mineralogical specimens''' has increased significantly during the last decade, owing to domestic and foreign donations. While minerals inserted into the collections in previous years mostly come from [[Russia]], [[Eastern Europe]], and [[Germany]], the contemporary collection includes minerals from [[Australia]], [[South America]], and [[Africa]]. Some of the most notable mineralogical samples include large [[quartz]], [[amethyst]], and [[fluoride]] druses.

=== History of science collection ===
The history of science collection with approximately 1 050 specimens comprises archival materials and historical items pertaining to the study and mediation of nature.

=== Photo collection ===
The photo collection contains photos, negatives and colour slides, 28 000 specimens in total, reflecting the daily life, exhibitions, field work and events of the museum throughout time. The photo collection of the museum has been digitised in [https://plutof.ut.ee/ the biodiversity information system PlutoF] under the acronym TAMF.

== Exhibits ==
*Tempos and Rhythms: From heartbeat to cosmic cycles
*On the Gulf of Finland
*Live spiders in the Estonian Museum of Natural History

The '''FIFA Women's World Rankings''' for [[Association football|football]] were introduced in 2003,&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt; with the first rankings published in March of that year, as a follow-on to the existing [[FIFA World Rankings]] for men. They attempt to compare the strength of internationally active women's national teams at any given time.

==Specifics of the ranking system==
*FIFA Women's World Rankings are based on every international match a team ever played, dating back to 1971, the first FIFA-recognized women's international between [[France women's national football team|France]] and [[Netherlands women's national football team|the Netherlands]].
*FIFA Women's World Rankings are implicitly weighted to emphasize recent results.
*FIFA Women's World Rankings are only published four times a year. Normally, rankings are released in March, June, September and December. (In [[FIFA Women's World Cup|World Cup]] years, dates may be adjusted to reflect the World Cup results.)

The first two points result from the FIFA Women's World Rankings system being based on the [[Elo rating system]] adjusted for football; in 2018, FIFA modified the men's ranking system to similarly be based on Elo systems after continued criticism. FIFA considers the ratings for teams with fewer than 5 matches provisional and at the end of the list. Also any team that plays no matches for 18 months becomes unranked.

==Leaders==
&lt;div style="text-align:center; float:right; clear:right; margin-left: 1em"&gt;'''FIFA Women's&lt;br&gt; World Ranking leaders'''&lt;br&gt;{{FIFA Women's World Ranking leaders}}&lt;/div&gt;
To date Germany and the United States have been the only two teams to have led the rankings. They have also held the top two spots in all but five releases, when Germany was ranked third: [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] was in second position in the first two rankings until Germany overtook them by winning the [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup]], [[Brazil women's national football team|Brazil]] was ranked second in March and June 2009 until Germany won [[UEFA Women's Euro 2009|2009 Euro]] and rejoined the top two, and [[England women's national football team|England]] reached the #2 ranking in March 2018.

The United States holds the record for the longest period being ranked first: almost 7 years, from March 2008 to December 2014.

In the latest rankings, action from [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification|Women's World Cup qualifying]] tournaments in [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|UEFA]] and [[2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship qualification|CONCACAF]], as well as the [[2018 Tournament of Nations]], caused movement throughout the rankings, though three of the top five did not change. The United States (#1), Germany (#2), and [[Canada women's national soccer team|Canada]] (#5) retained their positions while England (#3) and [[France women's national football team|France]] (#4) swapped. [[Australia women's national football team|Australia]] rose to #6 on a 33-point gain, the largest gain among any of the top 50 teams, though [[Uganda women's national football team|Uganda]] earned the most points of any team with 44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/news/y=2018/m=9/news=matildas-on-the-march-as-usa-stay-top.html|title=Matildas on the march as USA stay top|first=|last=FIFA.com|date=28 September 2018|website=fifa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ranking procedure==
The rankings are based on the following formulae:&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/r&amp;a-wwr/52/00/99/fs-590_06e_wwr-new.pdf| title=Fact Sheet, FIFA Women's World Ranking| accessdate=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''&lt;math&gt;R_{aft} = R_{bef} + K (S_{act} - S_{exp})&lt;/math&gt;'''

:'''&lt;math&gt;S_{exp} =  \frac{1}{1 + 10^{-x/2}}&lt;/math&gt;'''
&lt;!-- This is not exactly stated in the reference, but that equation does not give sensible results, while this one matches the general Elo format --&gt;
:'''&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{R_{bef} - O_{bef} \pm H}{c}&lt;/math&gt;'''

Where
{| style="width:50%;"
|-
|width=4%|
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;R_{aft}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The team rating after the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;R_{bef}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The team rating before the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;'''||= '''&lt;math&gt;15 M&lt;/math&gt;''', the weighted importance of the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;S_{act}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The actual result of the match, ''see below''&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;S_{exp}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The expected result of the match&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The scaled difference in rating points between the teams&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;O_{bef}&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The opposing team's rating before the match&lt;br&gt;

|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;'''||= A scaling factor, ''see below''&lt;br&gt;
|-
|'''&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;'''||= The "Match Importance Factor", ''see below''&lt;br&gt;
|}

The average points of all teams are about 1300 points. The top nations usually exceed 2000 points. In order to be ranked, a team must have played at least 5 matches against officially ranked teams, and have not been inactive for more than 18 months. Even if teams are not officially ranked, their points rating is kept constant until they play their next match.

===Actual result of the match===
The main component of the actual result is whether the team wins, loses, or draws, but goal difference is also taken into account.

If the match results in a winner and loser, the loser is awarded a percentage given by the accompanying table, with the result always less than or equal to 20% (for goal differences greater than zero). The result is based on the goal difference and the number of goals they scored. The remaining percentage points are awarded to the winner.  For example, a 2–1 match has the result awarded 84%–16% respectively, a 4–3 match has the result awarded 82%–18%, and an 8–3 match has the result awarded 96.2%–3.8%.  As such, it is possible for a team to lose points even if they win a match, assuming they did not "win by enough".

If the match ends in a draw the teams are awarded the same result, but the number depends on the goals scored so the results will not necessarily add up to 100%.  For example, a 0–0 draws earns both teams 47% each, a 1–1 draw earns 50% each, and a 4–4 draw earns 52.5% each.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;

====Actual result table====
The following is from a non-winning perspective (loss or draw). The factor for the winning team adds up to 100.

''Source''&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;

===Neutral ground or Home vs. Away===
Historically, home teams earn 66% of the points available to them, with away teams earning the other 34%.  To account for this, when two teams are not playing on neutral ground, the home team has its &lt;math&gt;R_{bef}&lt;/math&gt; inflated by 100 points for the purposes of calculation.  That is, if two equally ranked teams playing at one team's home ground, the home team would be expected to win at the same rate a team playing on neutral ground with a 100-point advantage.  This 100 point difference corresponds to a 64%–36% advantage in terms of expected result.

This also helps define the scaling constant &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, which has a value of 200.  In addition to a 100-point difference causing an expected result difference of 64%–36%, it also results in a 300-point difference causing expected results of 85%–15%.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;

'''FREJA''' was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[satellite]] developed by the [[Swedish Space Corporation]] on behalf of the [[Swedish National Space Board]]. It was piggyback launched on a [[Long March 2C]] launch vehicle from [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]] in China on October 6, 1992. The satellite's total cost was 19 million [[U.S. dollars]], excluding the costs of experiments.

It was funded with Swedish tax money through the [[Swedish National Space Board]], donations from the [[Wallenberg Foundation]] and approximately 25% from the [[Federal Ministry for Education and Research (Germany)|German Ministry for Science and Technology]].

'''Frost heaving''' (or a '''frost heave''') is an upwards swelling of [[soil]] during freezing conditions caused by an increasing presence of [[ice]] as it grows towards the surface, upwards from the depth in the soil where [[freezing]]  temperatures have penetrated into the soil (the freezing front or freezing boundary). Ice growth requires a water supply that delivers water to the freezing front via capillary action in certain soils. The weight of overlying soil restrains vertical growth of the ice and can promote the formation of lens-shaped areas of ice within the soil. Yet the force of one or more growing ice lenses is sufficient to lift a layer of soil, as much as {{convert|1|ft|m|abbr=off}} or more. The soil through which water passes to feed the formation of ice lenses must be sufficiently porous to allow [[capillary action]], yet not so porous as to break capillary continuity. Such soil is referred to as "frost susceptible".  The growth of ice lenses continually consumes the rising water at the freezing front.&lt;ref name="Taber 1929"&gt;

===Historical understanding of frost heaving ===
[[Image:Freezing air ice lens formation.jpg|thumbnail|right| Ice lens formation resulting in frost heave in cold climates.]]
According to Beskow, [[Urban Hjärne]] (1641–1724) described frost effects in soil in 1694.{{efn|In the section ''II.  Fl. Om Jord och Landskap i gemeen'' (II.  About the soil and the landscape in general) of his book, Hiärne mentions the phenomenon of "earth casting" or "earth heaving", in which, after the spring thaw, large chunks of sod appear to have been ripped from the ground and tossed: "3.  Whether one sees in other places in Sweden, Finland and Iceland, etc., as has so happened in Uppland and in Närke in Viby parish, royal Vallby, that the earth itself with turf and all [in pieces] up to a few cubits long and wide has been thrown upwards which 20 or more men could not do, and a large pit is left afterwards."  (''3.  Om man seer uti andre Orter i Swerige / Fin-Est och Lif-land / etc. så wara stedt / som hår i Upland / och i Nårike i Wijby Sochn / Kongz Wallby / at Jorden sig med Torff och all till någre Alnars Långd och bredd har opkastat det 20 eller flere Karlar teke hint göra / och en stoor Graff effter sig lemnat.'')

Beskow''] (Hanover, New Hampshire:  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers:  Cold Regions Research &amp; Engineering Laboratory, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1930, Stephen Taber (1882–1963), head of the Department of Geology at the University of South Carolina (Columbia, South Carolina), had disproved the hypothesis that frost heaving results from molar volume expansion with freezing of [[water]] already present in the soil prior to the onset of subzero temperatures, i.e. with little contribution from migration of water within the soil.

Since the [[molar volume]] of water expands by about 9% as it [[phase transition|changes phase]] from water to ice at its bulk [[freezing point]], 9% would be the maximum expansion possible owing to molar volume expansion, and even then only if the ice were rigidly constrained laterally in the soil so that the entire volume expansion had to occur vertically. Ice is unusual among compounds because it increases in molar volume from its liquid state, [[water]]. Most compounds decrease in volume when changing [[Phase (matter)|phase]] from liquid to solid. Taber showed that the vertical displacement of soil in frost heaving can be significantly greater than that due to molar volume expansion.&lt;ref name="Taber 1929"/&gt;

Taber demonstrated that liquid water migrates towards the freeze line within soil. He showed that other liquids, such as [[benzene]], which contracts when it freezes, also produce frost heave.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This excluded molar volume changes as the dominant mechanism for vertical displacement of freezing soil. His experiments further demonstrated the development of [[Ice Lens|ice lens]]es inside columns of soil that were frozen by cooling the upper surface only, thereby establishing a [[temperature gradient]].&lt;ref name=Bell2008&gt;

===Development of ice lenses===
[[File:Frost heaves on Bragg Hill Road in Norwich Vermont in March 2012--C.jpg|thumb|Frost heaves on a rural [[Vermont]] road during spring thaw]]
The dominant cause of soil displacement in frost heaving is the development of [[Ice Lens|ice lenses]]. During frost heave, one or more soil-free ice lenses grow, and their growth displaces the soil above them. These lenses grow by the continual addition of water from a groundwater source that is lower in the soil and below the freezing line in the soil. The presence of [[frost heaving#Frost-susceptible soils|frost-susceptible soil]] with a pore structure that allows [[capillary action|capillary flow]] is essential to supplying water to the ice lenses as they form.

Owing to the [[Gibbs–Thomson effect]] of the confinement of liquids in pores, water in soil can remain liquid at a temperature that is below the bulk freezing point of water.  Very fine pores have a very high [[curvature]], and this results in the [[liquid]] [[phase (matter)|phase]] being [[thermodynamic equilibrium|thermodynamically stable]] in such media at temperatures sometimes several tens of degrees below the bulk freezing point of the liquid.&lt;ref&gt;John Tyndall (1858) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/108660 "On some physical properties of ice,"] ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''148''' :  211–229.

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  This effect allows water to percolate through the soil towards the ice lens, allowing the lens to grow.

Another water-transport effect is the preservation of a few [[molecule|molecular]] layers of liquid water on the surface of the ice lens, and between ice and soil particles. Faraday reported in 1860 on the unfrozen layer of [[premelting|premelted]] water.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Micro-scale processes===
The same intermolecular forces that cause premelting at surfaces contribute to frost heaving at the particle scale on the bottom side of the forming ice lens. When ice surrounds a fine soil particle as it premelts, the soil particle will be displaced downward towards the warm direction within the thermal gradient due to melting and refreezing of the thin film of water that surrounds the particle. The thickness of such a film is temperature dependent and is thinner on the colder side of the particle.

Water has a lower [[thermodynamic free energy]] when in bulk ice than when in the supercooled liquid state. Therefore, there is a continuous replenishment of water flowing from the warm side to the cold side of the particle, and continuous melting to re-establish the thicker film on the warm side. The particle migrates downwards toward the warmer soil in a process that Faraday called "thermal regelation."&lt;ref name=Faraday/&gt; This effect purifies the ice lenses as they form by repelling fine soil particles. Thus a 10-[[nanometer]] film of unfrozen water around each [[micrometer]]-sized soil particle can move it 10 micrometers/day in a thermal gradient of as low as 1&amp;nbsp;°C&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=premelt/&gt; As ice lenses grow, they  lift the soil above, and segregate soil particles below, while drawing water to the freezing face of the ice lens via capillary action.

==Frost-susceptible soils==
[[Image:Permafrost stone-rings hg.jpg|thumb|right|Partially melted and collapsed lithalsas (heaved mounds found in [[permafrost]]) have left ring-like structures on the [[Svalbard]] Archipelago]]
Frost heaving requires a frost-susceptible soil, a continual supply of water below (a [[water table]]) and freezing temperatures, penetrating into the soil. Frost-susceptible soils are those with pore sizes between particles and particle surface area that promote [[capillary flow]]. Silty and loamy [[soil types]], which contain fine particles, are examples of frost-susceptible soils. Many agencies classify materials as being frost susceptible if 10 percent or more constituent particles pass through a 0.075&amp;nbsp;mm (No. 200) sieve or 3 percent or more pass through a 0.02&amp;nbsp;mm (No. 635) sieve. Chamberlain reported other, more direct methods for measuring frost susceptibility.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Based on such research, standard tests exist to determine the relative frost and thaw weakening susceptibility of soils used in pavement systems by comparing the heave rate and thawed bearing ratio with values in an established classification system for soils where frost-susceptibility is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Non-frost-susceptible soils may be too dense to promote water flow (low hydraulic conductivity) or too open in porosity to promote capillary flow. Examples include dense [[clay]]s with a small pore size and therefore a low hydraulic conductivity and clean [[sand]]s and [[gravel]]s, which contain small amounts of fine particles and whose pore sizes are too open to promote capillary flow.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The stony lithalsa (heaved mounds) found on the archipelago of [[Svalbard]] are an example. Frost heaves occur in alpine regions, even  near the [[equator]], as illustrated by palsas on [[Mount Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;

In [[Arctic]] [[permafrost]] regions, a related type of ground heaving over hundreds of years can create structures, as high as 60 metres, known as [[pingo]]s, which are fed by an upwelling of ground water, instead of the capillary action that feeds the growth of frost heaves. [[Cryogenic]] earth [[hummocks]] are a small formation resulting from [[granular convection]] that appear in seasonally frozen ground and have many different names; in North America they are earth hummocks; thúfur in [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]]; and pounus in [[Fennoscandia]]. 

Polygonal forms apparently caused by frost heave have been observed in near-polar regions of Mars by the [[Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter|Mars Orbiter Camera]] (MOC) aboard the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] and the [[HiRISE]] camera on the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]. In May 2008 the [[Mars Phoenix]] lander touched down on such a polygonal frost-heave landscape and quickly discovered ice a few centimetres below the surface.

==In refrigerated buildings==
Cold-storage buildings and ice rinks that are maintained at sub-freezing temperatures may freeze the soil below their foundations to a depth of tens of meters. Seasonally frozen buildings, e.g. some ice rinks, may allow the soil to thaw and recover when the building interior is warmed. If a refrigerated building's foundation is placed on frost-susceptible soils with a water table within reach of the freezing front, then the floors of such structures may heave, due to the same mechanisms found in nature. Such structures may be designed to avoid such problems by employing several strategies, separately or in tandem. The strategies include placement of non-frost-susceptible soil beneath the foundation, adding insulation to diminish the penetration of the freezing front, and heating the soil beneath the building sufficiently to keep it from freezing. Seasonally operated ice rinks can mitigate the rate of subsurface freezing by raising the temperature of the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2425">'''Geomechanics''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] prefix ''geo-'' meaning "[[earth]]"; and "[[mechanics]]") involves the geologic study of the behavior of [[soil]] and [[rock (geology)|rock]].

==Background==
The two main disciplines of geomechanics are [[soil mechanics]] and [[rock mechanics]]. The former deals with the behaviour of soil from a small scale to a [[landslide]] scale. The latter deals with issues in geosciences related to rock mass characterization and rock mass mechanics, such as applied to petroleum industry or high depths, tunnel design, rock breakage, and rock drilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slb.com/news/inside_news/2016/2016_0311_defining_geomechanics.aspx|title=Defining Geomechanics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aspects of geomechanics overlap with parts of [[geotechnical engineering]], [[engineering geology]], and geological engineering. Modern developments relate to [[seismology]], [[continuum mechanics]], discontinuum mechanics, and transport phenomena.

In the petroleum engineering industry, geomechanics is used to predict important parameters, such as in-situ rock stresses, modulus of elasticity, leak-off coefficient and Poisson's ratio. Reservoir parameters that include: formation porosity, permeability and bottom hole pressure can be derived from geomechanical evaluation. The geotechnical engineer or geophysicist relies on various techniques to obtain reliable geomechanical models. These techniques that have evolved over the years, are: coring, log analysis; well testing methods like hydraulic fracturing, and geophysical sonar methods such as acoustic emission.

In [[particle physics]], a '''glueball''' (also '''gluonium''', '''gluon-ball''') is a hypothetical composite [[subatomic particle|particle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Close]] and Phillip R. Page, "Glueballs", ''Scientific American'', vol. 279 no. 5 (November 1998) pp.&amp;nbsp;80–85&lt;/ref&gt; It consists solely of [[gluon]] particles, without valence [[quark]]s. Such a state is possible because gluons carry [[color charge]] and experience the [[strong interaction]] between themselves. Glueballs are extremely difficult to identify in [[particle accelerator]]s, because they [[quantum superposition|mix]] with ordinary [[meson]] states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Theoretical calculations show that glueballs should exist at energy ranges accessible with current [[collider]] technology. However, due to the aforementioned difficulty (among others), they have so far not been observed and identified with certainty,&lt;ref name="ochs"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolfgang Ochs |authorlink= Wolfgang Ochs |date=2013 |title=The status of glueballs |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.5183v3.pdf |journal=[[Journal of Physics G]] |volume=40 |pages=043001 |doi=10.1088/0954-3899/40/4/043001 |issue=4 |arxiv= 1301.5183 |bibcode= 2013JPhG...40d3001O }}&lt;/ref&gt; although phenomenological calculations have suggested that an experimentally identified glueball candidate, denoted &lt;math&gt;f_{0}(1710)&lt;/math&gt;, has properties consistent with those expected of a [[Standard Model]] glueball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Frederic Brünner |author2=Anton Rebhan |date=2015-09-21 |title=Nonchiral Enhancement of Scalar Glueball Decay in the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto Model |journal=Phys.

The prediction that glueballs exist is one of the most important predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics that has not yet been confirmed experimentally.&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;Y.K. Hsiao, C.Q. Geng, "Identifying Glueball at 3.02 GeV in Baryonic B Decays" (Version 2: October 9, 2013) https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3331&lt;/ref&gt;  Glueballs are the only particles predicted by the Standard Model with total angular momentum (J) (sometimes called "intrinsic spin") that could be either 2 or 3 in their ground states.

==Properties ==

In principle, it is theoretically possible for all properties of glueballs to be calculated exactly and derived directly from the equations and fundamental physical constants of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) without further experimental input. So, the predicted properties of these hypothetical particles can be described in exquisite detail using only Standard Model physics which have wide acceptance in the theoretical physics literature. But, there is considerable uncertainty in the measurement of some of the relevant key physical constants, and the QCD calculations are so difficult that solutions to these equations are almost always numerical approximations (reached by several very different methodologies). This can lead to variation in theoretical predictions of glueball properties like mass and branching ratios in glueball decays.

===Constituent particles and color charge===
Theoretical studies of glueballs have focused on glueballs consisting of either two gluons or three gluons, by analogy to [[meson]]s and [[baryon]]s that have two and three [[quark]]s respectively. As in the case of mesons and baryons, glueballs would be [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] color charge neutral. The [[baryon number]] of a glueball is zero.

===Total angular momentum===
Two gluon glueballs can have [[total angular momentum]] (J) of 0 (which are [[scalar boson|scalar]] or [[pseudo-scalar]]) or 2 ([[tensor]]). Three gluon glueballs can have total angular momentum (J) of 1 ([[vector boson]]) or 3. All glueballs have integer total angular momentum which implies that they are [[boson]]s rather than [[fermion]]s.

Glueballs are the only particles predicted by the [[Standard Model]] with total angular momentum (J) (sometimes called "[[spin (physics)|intrinsic spin]]") that could be either 2 or 3 in their ground states, although mesons made of two quarks with J=0 and J=1 with similar masses have been observed and excited states of other mesons can have these values of total angular momentum.

Fundamental particles with ground states having J=0 or J=2 are easily distinguished from glueballs. The hypothetical [[graviton]], while having a total angular momentum J=2 would be massless and lack color charge, and so would be easily distinguished from glueballs. The Standard Model [[Higgs boson]] for which an experimentally measured mass of about 125&amp;ndash;126&amp;nbsp;GeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has been determined is the only fundamental particle with J=0 in the Standard Model. It also lacks color charge and hence does not engage in strong force interactions. But the Higgs boson is about 25&amp;ndash;80&amp;nbsp;times as heavy as the mass of the various glueball states predicted by the Standard Model.

===Electric charge===
All glueballs would have an [[electric charge]] of zero as gluons themselves do not have an electric charge.

===Mass and parity===
Glueballs are predicted by quantum chromodynamics to be massive, notwithstanding the fact that gluons themselves have zero rest mass in the Standard Model. Glueballs with all four possible combinations of quantum numbers P ([[Parity (physics)|parity]]) and C (c-parity) for every possible total angular momentum have been considered, producing at least fifteen possible glueball states including excited glueball states that share the same quantum numbers but have differing masses with the lightest states having masses as low as 1.4 GeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (for a glueball with quantum numbers J=0, P=+, C=+), and the heaviest states having masses as great as almost 5 GeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (for a glueball with quantum numbers J=0, P=+, C=-).&lt;ref name="ochs"/&gt;

These masses are on the same order of magnitude as the masses of many experimentally observed [[list of mesons|mesons]] and [[list of baryons|baryons]], as well as to the masses of the [[tau lepton]], [[charm quark]], [[bottom quark]], some [[hydrogen]] isotopes, and some [[helium]] isotopes.

===Stability and decay channels===
Just as all Standard Model mesons and baryons, except the proton, are unstable in isolation, all glueballs are predicted by the Standard Model to be unstable in isolation, with various [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] calculations predicting the total decay width (which is functionally related to half-life) for various glueball states. QCD calculations also make predictions regarding the expected decay patterns of glueballs.&lt;ref name="slac.stanford.edu"&gt;Walter Taki, "Search for Glueballs" (1996) http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/ssi96-006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Walaa I. Eshraim, Stanislaus Janowski, "Branching ratios of the pseudoscalar glueball with a mass of 2.6 GeV", prepared for Proceedings of Confinement X - Conference on Quark Confinement and the Hadron Spectrum (Munich/Germany, 8–12 October 2012) (pre-print published January 15, 2013) https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3345&lt;/ref&gt; For example, glueballs would not have radiative or two photon decays, but would have decays into pairs of [[pion]]s, pairs of [[kaon]]s, or pairs of eta mesons.&lt;ref name="slac.stanford.edu"/&gt;

==Practical impact on macroscopic low energy physics==
[[File:Feynmann Diagram Glueball-to-Pion.svg|thumb|right|[[Feynman diagram]] of a glueball (''G'') decaying to two pions ({{subatomic particle|pion}}). Such decays help the study of and search for glueballs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=T. Cohen |author2=F. J. Llanes-Estrada |author3=J. R. Pelaez |author4=J. Ruiz de Elvira |title=Non-ordinary light meson couplings and the 1/Nc expansion|year=2014|arxiv=1405.4831 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.90.036003 |volume=90 |journal=Physical Review D|bibcode=2014PhRvD..90c6003C}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Because Standard Model glueballs are so ephemeral (decaying almost immediately into more stable decay products) and are only generated in high energy physics, glueballs only arise synthetically in the natural conditions found on Earth that humans can easily observe. They are scientifically notable mostly because they are a testable prediction of the Standard Model, and not because of phenomenological impact on macroscopic processes, or their [[engineering]] applications.

==Lattice QCD simulations==
[[Lattice QCD]] provides a way to study the glueball spectrum theoretically and from first principles. Some of the first quantities calculated using lattice [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] methods (in 1980) were glueball mass estimates.&lt;ref&gt;B. Berg. Plaquette-plaquette correlations in the su(2) lattice gauge theory. Phys. Lett., B97:401, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Morningstar and Peardon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Colin J.

The three lowest states are tabulated below. The presence of dynamical quarks would slightly alter these data, but also makes the computations more difficult. Since that time calculations within QCD (lattice and sum rules) find the lightest glueball to be a scalar with mass in the range of about 1000–1700 MeV.&lt;ref name="ochs"/&gt;

==Experimental candidates==

Particle accelerator experiments are often able to identify unstable composite particles and assign masses to those particles to a precision of approximately 10 MeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, without being able to immediately assign to the particle resonance that is observed all of the properties of that particle. Scores of such particles have been detected, although particles detected in some experiments but not others can be viewed as doubtful. Some of the candidate particle resonances that could be glueballs, although the evidence is not definitive, include the following:

===Vector, pseudo-vector, or tensor glueball candidates===

* X(3020) observed by the [[BaBar experiment|BaBar]] collaboration is a candidate for an excited state of the 2&amp;minus;+, 1+− or 1−− glueball states with a mass of about 3.02 GeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"/&gt;

===Scalar glueball candidates===
* f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(500) also known as σ – the properties of this particle are possibly consistent with a 1000 MeV or 1500 MeV mass glueball.&lt;ref name="ochs"/&gt;
* f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(980) – the structure of this composite particle is consistent with the existence of a light glueball.&lt;ref name="ochs"/&gt;
* f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(1370) – existence of this resonance is disputed but is a candidate for a glueball-meson mixing state&lt;ref name="ochs"/&gt;
* f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(1500) – existence of this resonance is undisputed but its status as a glueball-meson mixing state or pure glueball is not well established.&lt;ref name="ochs"/&gt;
* f&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(1710) – existence of this resonance is undisputed but its status as a glueball-meson mixing state or pure glueball is not well established.&lt;ref name="ochs"/&gt;

===Other candidates===

* Gluon jets at the [[LEP]] experiment show a 40% excess over theoretical expectations of electromagnetically neutral clusters which suggests that electromagnetically neutral particles expected in gluon rich environments such as glueballs are likely to be present.&lt;ref name="ochs"/&gt;

Many of these candidates have been the subject of active investigation for at least eighteen years.&lt;ref name="slac.stanford.edu"/&gt; The [[GlueX]] experiment has been specifically designed to produce more definitive experimental evidence of glueballs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gluex.org/GlueX/Physics.html | title = The Physics of GlueX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OccultLunarWorldMap.jpg|thumb|left|A  map showing the path of the lunar shadow as it crosses the earth.  In this case, the star is Antares and the predicted date is 2027 September 7th.]]

A '''lunar [[occultation]]''' occurs when the [[Moon]], moving along its orbital path, passes in front of a [[star]] or other celestial object, as seen by an observer (normally on the Earth).  Light from the occulted object is blocked by the moon and a shadow of the moon is cast onto the ground.  The moon's shadow moves west-to-east due to the orbit of the moon and the rotation of the earth, as shown on the image at left.

The left (western) ellipse represents moonrise for that region of the globe. The right (eastern) ellipse represents moon set for that region. The northern and southern path limits are shown. Sites between the white lines will see the event occur at night, while sites between the blue lines will see the event occur during twilight, and sites between the red dotted lines may witness the event during the day-time, for stars brighter than mag.2.  Source - Occult (Software).

A '''grazing lunar occultation''' (also lunar grazing occultation, lunar graze, or just graze) is seen at locations along the north and south limits, and the observer will see the object disappear as the shadow of mountains pass by, and reappear as the light  passes down the valleys on the edge of the moon.

[[File:OccultGrazeProfile-Observed.jpg|thumb|Observed events plotted on the limb profile.]]

A plot of the results from a single observer graze expedition, where eight events were observed. The path of the star is shown curved, when in reality it is the moon moving past the star. The first disappearance is shown on the left (red) and the last reappearance on the right (green).  The olive coloured dots are altitude soundings from the data points from the [[SELENE|Kaguya lunar orbiter]].

A team of many observers can combine observed events and construct an extremely accurate profile of the lunar terrain.  Since graze paths rarely pass over established observatories, amateur astronomers use portable observing equipment and travel to sites along the shadow path limits. The goal is to report the [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] of each event as accurately as possible, and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] disciplined devices are frequently used as the time-base.

Two methods are used to observe
* visual - the observer has an audible UTC beeping device (e.g. a shortwave radio tuned to [[WWV (radio station)|WWV]]) and an audio recorder (e.g. a [[tape recorder]]) and watches the target through the telescope, and calls 'Gone' when the star disappears, and 'Back' when the star reappears.  The audio recording is later analysed to extract the event times.
*[[video]] - the observer uses a small video camera, usually mounted in the focuser of the telescope. A Video Time Inserter (VTI) is commonly used to insert a UTC time-stamp onto each frame of the recording. Either a [[camcorder]], [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] or a [[laptop]] computer is used to record the video stream.  The video recording is later analysed to extract event times.

All known lunar occultations, (both total lunar occultations as well as grazing lunar occultations) are archived at the [[VizieR]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=VI/132B|title=VizieR Lunar Occultation Archive|last=Herald|first=David|date=|website=vizier.u-strasbg.fr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Chester Cato''' (2 November 1926 &amp;ndash; 30 January 2011) was an Australian photographer and teacher. Cato started his career as a commercial photographer and later moved towards [[fine art photography]] and education. Cato spent most of his life in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newton|first1=Gael|title=Shades of Light|date=1988|publisher=Australian National Gallery|location=Canberra|isbn=0642081522|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ballarat International Foto Biennal - Core &amp; Special Events Guide 2013" /&gt;

==Photography career==
Cato’s career in photography started at the age of 12 as an apprentice to his father, [[Jack Cato]]. Returning in 1946 after service in the Pacific for the Royal Australian during [[World War II|WW2]], Cato worked as a self-employed photographer before being employed by [[The Argus (Melbourne)|Argus Newspaper]] as a photojournalist in 1947. Cato held that position until 1950 when he became a photographer and assistant for [[Athol Shmith]] Pty Ltd. in [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]], Melbourne and married Dawn Helen Cadwallader in October that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51600494 |title=Intimate Jottings |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] |volume=17, |issue=28 |location=Australia, Australia |date=17 December 1949 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |page=19 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23018588 |title=Family Notices |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)]] |issue=32,481 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=9 October 1950 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he undertook research for his father Jack on the latter's ''The Story of the Camera in Australia'' published in 1955. In 1955, Cato and Shmith became business partners and started Athol Shmith-John Cato Pty Ltd.

When in 1959-60 the [[MoMA]] [[The Family of Man]] exhibition toured Australia Cato visited the show several times and was inspired by its [[Humanist photography|humanist]] themes and optimism.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Gael. Shades of Light: Photography and Australia 1839-1988. Sydney: Australian National Gallery, William Collins, 1988, p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved away from the commercial photography world in 1974 after experiencing what he described as "a kind of menopause". Shortly after leaving his partnership with Athol Shmith, Cato began his teaching career and started to focus on fine art photography. Cato was one of the first photographers in Melbourne to give up their commercial practice to become a fine art photographer.&lt;ref name="Ballarat International Foto Biennal - Core &amp; Special Events Guide 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ballarat International Foto Biennal - Core &amp; Special Events Guide 2013|url=http://ballaratfoto.org/content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/03/bifb13_core_special_guide.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jack Cato's Melbourne"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Cato's Melbourne: An Interview with John Cato|url=http://www3.slv.vic.gov.au/latrobejournal/issue/latrobe-65/t1-g-t3.html|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willis|first1=Anne-Marie|title=Picturing Australia: A History of Photography|date=1988|publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson Publishers|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=0207155992|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Cato Retrospective" /&gt;

==Fine art photography==
In 1970, four years before leaving his commercial practice, Cato began exploring photography as an art form. His fine art photography drew connections between humanity and the environment, exploring a different theme in each [[photo essay]].

Cato made 'straight' (directly imaged)&amp;nbsp;[[landscape photography|landscape photographs]] usually with large or medium-format cameras in order to "explore the elements of the landscape", usually enhancing these in printing. Over a ten-year period, Cato spent two years at a time focusing on a particular symbolic theme in the Australian landscape, often spending a large amount of time in the wilderness observing the conditions and waiting for the perfect opportunity. He would often wait and contemplate a scene for days before finally pressing the shutter when the moment was right. Cato's work was deeply considered and clearly showed his unique perspective on the natural elements around us.&lt;ref name="Ballarat International Foto Biennal - Core &amp; Special Events Guide 20132"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ballaratfoto.org/content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/03/bifb13_core_special_guide.pdf|title=Ballarat International Foto Biennal - Core &amp; Special Events Guide 2013|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Australian - Nature's gentle man2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/natures-gentle-man/story-e6frg8h6-1226692887191|title=Nature's gentle man|date=10 August 2013|publisher=The Australian|last1=Stieven-Taylor|first1=Alison|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|quote="The meeting of land and sea has always held a mystic fascination for me. Through my camera, my experience of it has been heightened, my awareness of its wonder deepened. Above all, I remember its clamorous silence."&lt;ref name="John Cato Retrospective" /&gt;|source=John Cato 1976|align=right|width=35%}}

Cato frequently used&amp;nbsp;[[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[mysticism]]&amp;nbsp;in his work. This was popular in the 1970s amongst both new and experienced photographers, including his colleague Paul Cox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shades of Light|date=1988|publisher=Australian National Gallery|isbn=0642081522|location=Canberra|page=148|last1=Newton|first1=Gael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Picturing Australia: A History of Photography|date=1988|publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson Publishers|isbn=0207155992|location=London, United Kingdom|page=235|last1=Willis|first1=Anne-Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate around the question of the status of photography as an art form was quite relevant during Cato’s time. Some think of Cato as one of the first Australian photographers to blend the idea of a photograph being both a creative interpretation of a scene and a recording of reality. Some photographers of a similar era, such as&amp;nbsp;[[Ansel Adams]], were more technical in their photography, resulting in less manipulation or interpretation of the scene when compared to Cato’s work, whose imagery and photographic print making is more appropriately compared to that of&amp;nbsp;[[Minor White]]&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;[[Bill Brandt]]. Cinematographer Nino Martinetti, one of Cato’s past students, said "Look carefully at John Cato’s simple photographs of rocks, branches, trees, bark, sand, water and reflections… is that reality? Yes, but not as many people see it. This is the fine line where the art of photography and reality stand, where the artist captures an emotion for us to share and interpret."&lt;ref name="BIFB Program Guide Book2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ballarat International Foto Biennale|date=2013|publisher=Ballarat International Foto Biennale Inc.|isbn=9780992305505|location=Ballarat|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cato's personal work was described as "a reflection of the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], not of light, that allows a consciousness to be present in the figuration of the photographic prints. The personal work is an expression of his self, his experience, his story and his language."&lt;ref name="John Cato Retrospective"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Paul|last2=Gracey|first2=Bryan|title=John Cato : retrospective|date=2013|publisher=Wilkinson Publishing|location=Melbourne, Vic|isbn=9781922178091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth Song===
Earth Song was Cato's first collection of personal work to be exhibited. This series consisted of 52 colour photographs sequenced in a way that allowed the work to be recognised as individual photographs and as part of an overall concept. Cato's use of musical analogies can be seen in the sequencing of Earth Song. The sequence was described as using "melodic line and symphonic form as its metaphoric basis".&lt;ref name="John Cato Retrospective" /&gt;

Earth Song was exhibited as part of the Frontiers exhibition, a group show at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in 1971. The group consisted of photographers who were exploring the idea of photography as an art form and were looking for a way to see the world differently through their camera.&lt;ref name="John Cato Retrospective" /&gt;

===Essay 1: Landscapes in a Figure===
In Cato's first photographic essay, he completed five black and white photo sequences between 1971 and 1979. In each sequence, Cato explored the expression of nature and creation, which he saw as the physical representation of his own life experiences and philosophy.&lt;ref name="John Cato Retrospective" /&gt;

===Essay 2: Figures in a Landscape===
Essay 2 is more politically driven compared to other work and focuses on "the sublimation of [[Australian Aboriginal culture|Aboriginal culture]] by Europeans". This series explores the idea of destruction of culture, spirituality and physicality using [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality]] to represent the idea photographically.&lt;ref name="John Cato Retrospective" /&gt;

===Double Concerto: An Essay in Fiction===
Double Concerto was Cato's final photo essay. This photo essay was published under the deliberately androgynous '[[Everyman]]' names Pat Noone and Chris Noone, two identities that Cato created to "visualise alternative conditions within himself". Each sequence explored how individual people can witness and experience the world very differently from each other.&lt;ref name="John Cato Retrospective" /&gt; This series was exhibited as Cato's "farewell show" at Luba Bilu Gallery in Greville St. [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]] on his retirement from teaching.

==Teaching career==
Cato began his teaching career in 1975 at Prahran College of Advanced Education. Between 1977 and 1979 Cato contributed to the foundation of [[Photography Studies College]] and also lectured there until becoming head of the photography department at [[Victoria College, Melbourne|Prahran College of Advanced Education]]. Cato held the position of department head until his retirement in 1991. Cato was a passionate and generous teacher and was highly regarded by his students and peers. He described himself as being "duty bound" to share his experience with students and colleagues.&lt;ref name="Ballarat International Foto Biennal - Core &amp; Special Events Guide 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="John Cato Retrospective" /&gt;

Many of Cato's past students have gone on to hold well regarded positions in the photography, art and education fields. Amongst Cato’s students was [[Bill Henson]], a well known Australian contemporary art photographer. Cato inspired Henson with his use of musical analogies, which Henson later incorporated in his own work.&lt;ref name="Ballarat International Foto Biennal - Core &amp; Special Events Guide 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jack Cato's Melbourne" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newton|first1=Gael|title=Shades of Light|date=1988|publisher=Australian National Gallery|location=Canberra|isbn=0642081522|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Cox (director)|Paul Cox]], one of Cato's colleagues at Prahran College of Advanced Education, stated that while the staff of Cato’s department were photographers, none of them were qualified teachers. Cox said "Can you imagine that happening today? … At Prahran, teachers and students learnt from each other. It was an exchange."&lt;ref name="The Australian - Nature's gentle man" /&gt;

Cato preferred to use [[large format (photography)|large format cameras]] for the excellent quality and resolution that they offered. When taking students on camping trips, he insisted they use the same instead of [[Single-lens reflex camera|35mm SLR cameras]], which were the 'weapon of choice' at the time, convinced that the more technical view camera would force students think before they pressed the shutter and pre-visualise their photograph, rather than to 'blaze away' with expendable roll film.&lt;ref name="BIFB Program Guide Book2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGV John Cato"&gt;{{cite web|title=NGV - John Cato|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/artist/2017/|website=National Gallery of Victoria - John Cato|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cato strongly believed in photography as a form of individualised expressionism, a view that was shared by Athol Shmith, who was one of the first to teach photography as a creative course in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willis|first1=Anne-Marie|title=Picturing Australia: A History of Photography|date=1988|publisher=Angus &amp; Robertson Publishers|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=0207155992|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions and galleries==
Cato exhibited his work with other photographers in 24 group exhibitions between 1964 and 2003.&lt;ref name="John Cato Retrospective" /&gt; and in 17 solo exhibitions in Australian and international galleries. In 1973 he was included with [[Joseph Stanislaus Ostoja-Kotkowski|Stan Ostoja-Kotkowski]], [[Mark Strizic]], Peter Medlen and John Wilkins in ''Frontiers'' at the [[National Gallery of Victoria|NGV]] which toured to the Australian Embassy in [[Bangkok|Bankok]], June 27– July 5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110740295 |title=Thais ignore exhibition |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=47, |issue=13,501 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=31 July 1973 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and showed at Abraxas Gallery, [[Manuka, Australian Capital Territory|Manuka]], in December 1974 with [[Sue Ford]], Les Gray and Mark Strizic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110788941 |title=LIFE STYLE |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=49, |issue=13,918 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=21 November 1974 |accessdate=5 March 2016 |page=14 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cato’s first solo exhibition was held at [[Horsham]] Art Gallery (Victoria, Australia) in 1975, with subsequent solo exhibitions being held every few years up until 2004.

Cato’s work is held in numerous gallery collections across Australia including the [[National Gallery of Australia]], the National Gallery of Victoria, Horsham Art Gallery, [[Albury]] Regional Art Gallery, [[Deakin University]], [[Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery|Tasmanian Art Gallery]] and [[Melbourne Teachers' College|Melbourne State College]]. In addition to Australian galleries, Cato’s work is also held in collections in the [[Bibliotheque Nationale]] in [[Paris]] and Schmidtbank Weiden in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="John Cato Retrospective" /&gt;

Paul Cox and Bryan Gracey, both teachers at Prahran College, co-curated a collection of Cato’s work to be exhibited at the 2013 Ballarat International Foto Biennale. Cox and Gracey both believe that Cato’s work deserves to be seen and recognised for what it is. The exhibition features Cato’s black and white landscape photographs taken between 1971 and 1991. In regard to the exhibition, Paul Cox said "John will ride a high wave. He belongs in the National Gallery, in the high echelons and I think this is a very wonderful first step."&lt;ref name="The Australian - Nature's gentle man" /&gt;

==Reputation, legacy and awards==
Cato was known for being a very humble photographer. He never intended for himself or his work to become famous. In his mind, the work was its own reward. In the 2013 Ballarat International Foto Biennale guide, Cato was described as being "underrated" and "far ahead of his time".&lt;ref name="BIFB Program Guide Book2"/&gt;

Paul Cox said the following in an article for ''[[The Australian]]'': "He was a dreamer. I always adored him. John had a wonderful heart; he was tender for a man. You know you don’t know many people like that."&lt;ref name="The Australian - Nature's gentle man"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stieven-Taylor|first1=Alison|title=Nature's gentle man|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/natures-gentle-man/story-e6frg8h6-1226692887191|accessdate=20 April 2015|publisher=The Australian|date=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact he had a strong dislike of publicity, Cato would sometimes publish his work under a pseudonym, characteristically exhibiting his valedictory exhibition as 'Pat and Chris Noone' . Paul Cox said "Ego is always the biggest limitation of an artist, but John had no ego. He was a free man."&lt;ref name="The Australian - Nature's gentle man" /&gt; Isobel Crombie, head photography curator at the National Gallery of Victoria, shared Cox's opinion and said "He was different in that he did not have the huge ego of some of his contemporaries."&lt;ref name="SMH Article"&gt;{{cite news|title=Life through unvarnished lens|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/life-through-unvarnished-lens-20110220-1b154.html|accessdate=20 April 2015|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wheeler Peak, NM.JPG|thumb|400px|[[Wheeler Peak (New Mexico)|Wheeler Peak]] is the highest summit of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[New Mexico|State of New Mexico]].
]]

This article comprises three sortable tables of [[Summit|major mountain peaks]]&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[New Mexico|State of New Mexico]].

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in this article include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Highest major summits|first table]] below ranks the 30 highest major summits of New Mexico by elevation.
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;  The [[#Most prominent summits|second table]] below ranks the 30 most prominent summits of New Mexico.
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Most isolated major summits|third table]] below ranks the 30 most isolated major summits of New Mexico.

==Highest major summits==
{{GeoGroup|section=Highest major summits}}
Of the highest major summits of New Mexico, [[Wheeler Peak (New Mexico)|Wheeler Peak]] exceeds {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation, 11 peaks exceed {{convert|3500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and 26 peaks exceed {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation.

A '''whitewater river''' is any river where its gradient and/or flow create [[rapid]]s or [[whitewater]] turbulence. This list only focuses on rivers which are suitable for whitewater sports such as [[Whitewater canoeing|canoeing]], [[Whitewater kayaking|kayaking]], and [[rafting]].

== Africa ==
* [[Zambezi]], [[Zambia]]
* [[Nile]], [[Uganda]]
* [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana River]], [[Kenya]]

== Asia ==

=== Pakistan ===
* [[Sutlej]]
* [[Braldu River|Braldu]]
* [[Swat River|Swat]]
* [[Kunhar River]]
* [[Indus River]]

=== Thailand ===
* [[Wa River]] is a popular whitewater rafting destination in the [[Nan Province]] of [[Thailand]]. It has rapids ranging from difficulty levels of 2 through 6.
* [[Wang Thong River]] is a popular whitewater rafting destination in the [[Phitsanulok Province]] of [[Thailand]]. It has rapids ranging from difficulty levels of 3 through 5.

=== India ===
In the north, most rivers in India descend from the [[Himalayas]], the highest mountains on earth: cold glacial waters thunder down the rocks,bringing with them ample whitewater rapids to encounter.
North India
* [[Zanskar]], a Grand Canyonesque experience. Class III-IV. Gradings, as on all rivers, subject to change depending on volume of water.
* [[Alaknanda]]
* [[Bhagirathi River|Bhagirathi]]
* [[Brahmaputra River]]- This river begins in Tibet and winds its way towards [[Arunachal Pradesh]], from whence it continues in a very steep gradient. Class V in high volume, but Class VI on some waterfalls that must be portaged. This area is a contested area between India and China and much paperwork is required to ride it.
* [[Mandakini River|Mandakini]]
* [[Ganges]]
* [[Tons River|Tons]]
* [[Kali]]
* [[Yamuna]]
* [[Teesta River|Teesta]]
* [[Rangit]]

==== South India ====
Towards the south, all rivers originate from the [[Western Ghats]]. Most of them can only be paddled in the monsoon season (June–October), while some others can be paddled year round as they are dependent on dam releases. Only a small percentage of the rivers have recorded descents, and there is a vast potential for first descents.

== Europe ==

=== United Kingdom ===

Whitewater rivers in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] are typically low volume and technical. In [[England]] and [[Wales]] rivers are typically less than 20&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s, and some are run with less than 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s (usually these involve skidding the kayak down steep rockslides and small waterfalls). In [[Scotland]] there are also a few bigger volume (up to about 50&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s) rivers.

Almost all runs in England and Wales need recent rain to be at a paddleable level, and many can only be run immediately after heavy rain. In Scotland some bigger rivers can be run for weeks after rain although as with the rest of the country, most need recent wet weather. The paddling season is year-round but the rivers are more often runnable in winter (the wettest months of the year being December and January). Exceptions to this include rivers which have artificially maintained flows from reservoirs. On these rivers flow may increase in dry weather as more water is released. The [[Afon Tryweryn]] is one example in Wales.

Most runs offer only a few kilometres of whitewater; often several rivers can be run on a wet day. Some rivers consist of only a single rapid. Only a few rivers (such as the [[River Findhorn|Findhorn]] and [[River Spean|Spean]] in the Scottish Highlands) have more than a days' worth of paddling, and most of this tends to be grade III or less.

The [[River Dart]] excepted, there is no natural whitewater in the (mainly flat) south and east of England. Here whitewater paddlers often go [[playboating]] at man made [[weir]]s. [[Hurley weir]] on the [[River Thames]] west of London is probably the most popular. There are several [[artificial whitewater]] courses, where water is pumped or diverted though a concrete channel containing obstacles to create rapids. There is a 28&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s artificial whitewater course on the [[River Trent|Trent]] at [[Holme Pierrepont]] in [[Nottingham]] (at the [[Holme Pierrepont National Watersports Centre|National Watersports Centre]]), a 5&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s course on the [[River Tees|Tees]] in [[Teesside]], and smaller courses on the Nene at [[Northampton]], and at [[Cardington Artificial Slalom Course|Cardington]].

In [[England]] Commercial rafting is limited to artificial whitewater courses (where it often provides the majority of the courses' income). Bigger and more reliable rivers can be found in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], in particular the [[River Findhorn]], [[River Orchy]], [[River Spey]], [[River Tay]] and the [[Afon Tryweryn]].

There are several sites off the west coast of Britain where strong tidal currents channeled between islands create big volume sections of whitewater. These include the Bitches in Pembrokeshire in Wales, and the [[Falls of Lora]] on the west coast of Scotland.

Legal access to whitewater is a big issue in England and Wales. The law is currently unclear, resulting in two schools of thought followed. 
* The first, followed by many anglers and the Anglers Association, states that rivers are almost all private and requires access agreements to be set up with the [[riparian|riparian owners]]. This means that the public are only allowed access to a tiny proportion of the available whitewater, and often this is restricted to a few months or even a few days per year. This also limits commercial operations and the activities of clubs. Agreements rarely exist as there is no incentive for the owners of rivers to let anyone else use them.
* Recently, legal research conducted by Rev Dr Douglas Caffyn,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caffynonrivers.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; claims to have identified a public right of access on all navigable rivers in England and Wales in [[Common Law]]. In law a public right is a higher right than any private right, and so this outweighs the rights of the [[riparian owners]] in a court of law.

In Scotland, like most of the rest of the world, access to whitewater is legal and has never been illegal. It has been enshrined in law in the recent Scottish [[Land Reform]] act. The [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000|Right to Roam]] act in England explicitly excluded rivers. The [[British Canoe Union]] is running the [[Rivers Access Campaign]] to raise awareness and bring about changes in the law to permit public access to all inland rivers in England and Wales.

=== Alps ===

Popular whitewater rivers in the [[Alps]] are mainly medium volume [[glacier]]-fed rivers with long continuous rapids and few big drops. The season is short (two or three months in early summer when the snow and glaciers are melting) but the whitewater is reliable in this period. Tourists come from around Europe to kayak and raft–the most popular centres are [[Briançon]] in the [[French Alps]],  the area around [[Landeck]] in [[Austria]], and [[Bovec]] in [[Slovenia]].

=== Norway ===

[[Norway|Norwegian]] whitewater rivers are typically steep pool-drop rivers with many waterfalls, and are run mainly by experienced kayakers. There are also bigger (sometimes glacier-fed) rivers which are sometimes rafted. The season lasts all summer, although some rivers only run after recent rain. Norwegian waterfalls regularly feature on extreme kayaking videos.

=== Sweden ===
The Swedish whitewater rivers are mainly big water and is located in the middle and north parts of Sweden. One of the most spectacular rivers is Vindelaelven and particularly Trollforsarna III-VI, where one Euro cup competition was held in 2007.

The main information channel for Swedish white water is [[Forsguiden]],

== North America ==

=== Canada ===

Canada has a varied terrain that supports many kinds of environments, with the majority of whitewater found in three areas: the mountainous Rockies in Alberta, the smaller Eastern forests of Quebec, Ontario, and some of the Maritimes, and the volcanic influenced geology of British Columbia. This creates the conditions necessary for whitewater: gradient, volume, and pressure. Like its neighbor to the south, [[First Nations]] had used the river systems as personal highways and built [[dugout canoes]] to run rapids; later [[French Canadian]] fur trappers used the same technique to collect beaver pelts and form small settlements.

Canadian whitewater rivers are characterized by the dramatic difference between the high water spring run-off and the summer low water volume; the classification of rapids therefore changes from spring to summer. It also is highly subject to the change of seasons, where many places are frozen solid by October and, for example, runs that are ready in late May in the neighboring US Pacific Northwest are still too dangerous to attempt in British Columbia or too cold: the spring run-off of the glaciers has either not finished or the landscape is not fully thawed.    

Most of the land in Canada is not privately owned and likewise neither are the rivers. Many places in which water thunders through the terrain are on land that is either protected or very remote, so knowledge of first aid and the local wildlife is paramount. As with the United States to the South, [[rattlesnakes]], [[grizzly bear]]s, [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[mountain lion]]s, [[wolves]], and two members of the [[lynx]] family are very much active at the height of rafting and kayaking season, and they do use the water as a source of food and sustenance.  On multi day excursions in British Columbia or Alberta it is extremely important to know or learn to coexist with the grizzly bears that live there and may use some rapids for salmon fishing.  Foreign visitors must learn to never take any food or anything with a sweet scent into their sleeping grounds and cook and eat many hundreds of yards away, hoisting all food supply or items that are perfumed, like soap, high on a branch hundreds of feet off the ground that is too slim to support the weight of a large brown bear. (These rules also apply for black bears in the East as well: both bears have excellent senses of smell and will not hesitate to rip open a tent to get something as simple as a breath mint.) They must also learn never to run away from predators as it attracts their attention. Dogs must be secured carefully in campsites at night as it is not safe for them to be outside by themselves.

==== Ontario ====
* [[Niagara River]] This river is very dangerous.  The Canadian side of the river has the largest of the three set of waterfalls that make up [[Niagara Falls]], all rated Class VI: As with the American side of the river, the current is strong, the drop is high, and at the bottom the force of the falling water can slam a man underwater and churn him around like a washing machine where he never gets up for air and most likely will die.  Niagara Gorge squeezes a large volume that rivals the Congo River in size of the water in spite of being smaller in area.  It has two very large whirlpools and is a deathtrap for kayakers and all boaters.  A person will be arrested if found below the falls as both the state of New York and the Province of Ontario agree that too many have died to allow it.

=== United States ===

Like Canada, the United States offers varied terrain and conditions through which rivers pass, everything from the deserts of the southwest to glacial peaks in Alaska to Appalachian creeks that thunder through the glades to even a few that run right through the downtown sections of small cities and isolated hamlets.  The geography is friendly to all whitewater disciplines depending on the particular  river or creek, including rafts, canoes, kayaks, and more recently, paddleboards. In the past, Native Americans and later explorers like [[Lewis and Clark]]  and [[John
Frémont]] would run their canoes through the rapids and used the rivers like highways to trade and to travel between settlements.

Legally, most rivers and creeks are not privately held. They are the property of the nation and its people and are overseen by individual state governments and a handful of federal government agencies in [[Washington, DC]] like the [[Department of the Interior]], [[National Park Service]], [[National Forest Service]], and [[Bureau of Land Management]]. Dams may be held on a contract basis with the federal or state government, for example the energy company [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|PG&amp;E]] has dams in the Sierra Nevada range near Sacramento in California and this affects water volume. (Other entities like the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] in the East have similar arrangements.)  The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] and the operators of the dams themselves usually schedule releases in advance and this information is readily available to the public upon request.

Many whitewater rivers and creeks exist in rather rural or wild conditions when compared to parts of Europe and thus are located in places where animals can bite back or harm visitors, including children and dogs. (Some require a substantial hike through forest, desert, or mountains to reach the put in and cannot be reached by car at all.) In no particular order or regard to specific geography, they would include [[grizzly bear]]s, [[American black bear|black bears]], [[moose]], [[wapiti|bull elk]],  [[porcupines]], [[cougar]]s, [[bobcats]], more than 15 species of [[rattlesnake]]s on both sides of the Mississippi, [[scorpion]]s, [[agkistrodon contortrix|copperheads]], [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|water mocassin]]s and [[coral snakes]]. [[Beavers]] are usually extant on most rivers but prefer to build in the calmer sections where there are only minor riffles and their dams are easily portaged or surmounted.  It is thus very wise to purchase a wildlife and wilderness guide before embarking on a trip as well as understand that there may be no hospital or towns for miles.  First aid knowledge is paramount.

Permits are required for certain rivers as a means of tracking who is on the river at a given time, how many people are out there, and these are available for a nominal fee. Littering while on the river is usually prohibited and can net a very heavy fine into the tens of thousands of dollars, plus have the net result of destroying habitat for several species.

Dogs, usually those weighing more than 14&amp;nbsp;kg, are a common sight on many trips where the rapids do not exceed class III+, though visitors from other countries should be made aware that such trips require a few things: vaccination against [[rabies]], [[canine distemper]], [[kennel cough]], [[coronavirus]],  and [[Lyme disease]], and the paperwork from the vet proving he has had them within the last six months. He has to be kept on a leash when not in the boat because if he is going to a place with wild beasts, he must be restrained lest he get himself into trouble: bears in particular will not hesitate to charge if a wandering pooch challenges them and neither will porcupines. For these reasons in all National Parks including the Grand Canyon, being off leash is absolutely forbidden.  He needs to be able to obey his master and obey basic commands and in all watercraft he must have a life jacket so if he has to swim for it, he can doggy paddle to shore.

==== Rivers of the Eastern United States ====

Despite popular belief abroad, the Western USA is not the only place where there is true whitewater in the country: there are several places in the East where the water roars, everything from big rivers like the [[Delaware River]] to creeks that dive over large waterfalls, many exceeding {{convert|30|ft|m}}. In fact, there used to be more of them but over time some of these have been dammed or altered; the upper portions of the Mississippi River near St. Paul Minnesota, for example, used to have very large rapids and several waterfalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fmr.org/dam-removal|title=Restoring rapids to the Mississippi river gorge|date=2018-04-09|work=Friends of the Mississippi River|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2018, many of these dams are being removed or in talks to be removed as new and better ways of hydroelectric power and newer techniques of flood control are being explored.

Rivers in the eastern section of the United States are usually considered "technical" for a few reasons: first, unlike in the West, large portions of the East were cut through by glaciers long ago. This makes several rivers have rockier bottoms rather than the sandy bottoms of the West.  Second, water volume: the volume is lower in the East. Rafters, canoers, and kayakers must often direct their craft through boulder-strewn sections of river, through narrow channels, squeezes, and shoals. Third, vegetation: unlike the more famous rivers like the Colorado, Eastern rivers tend to cut through temperate forests: if a tree falls down on the riverbank, improvisation is a must.  All of this requires a degree of "river reading" skill, paddling precision, and understanding of hazards such as undercut rocks, strainers, and how to get unpinned from surprise obstacles.

===== Northeast =====

The following are some of the rivers in the Northeast that are popular.
* [[Ashuelot River]], [[New Hampshire]], Class 3-4
* [[Bearcamp River]], [[New Hampshire]], Class 2-4
* [[Contoocook River]], [[New Hampshire]], Class 3-4
* [[Dead River (Kennebec River)|Dead River]], [[Maine]], Class 3-5
* [[Deerfield River]], [[Vermont]] and [[Massachusetts]], Class 2-5. Navigable from spring until just before Halloween, when the water begins to freeze. First rafting companies set up here in the 1980s.  
* [[Farmington River]], [[Massachusetts]] and [[Connecticut]], Class 3
* [[Gale River]], [[New Hampshire]], Class 1-4
* [[Gauley River]], [[West Virginia]], Class 4-5+
* [[Genessee River]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Class 2-3.
* [[Housatonic River]], [[Connecticut]], Class 1-5
* [[Kennebec River]], [[Maine]], mostly Class 2-4
* [[Lehigh River]], Whitehaven to Jim Thorpe, [[Pennsylvania]] - a {{convert|24|mi|km|adj=on}} run, through a beautiful gorge, Class 3; in high water this is a Class 4 run.
* [[Millers River]], [[Massachusetts]], Class 3
* [[Nescopeck Creek]], Pennsylvania, Class 2-3
* [[Potomac River]], Maryland/Virginia, Class 2-5+. There are two sections of this river that are of note, one to the west, the other far to the east. The first set is the [[Great Falls of the Potomac]]. This is only {{convert|15|mi|km|adj=on}} 15 miles upriver from [[Washington DC]] and drops {{convert|76|ft|m}} in less than a mile.  This section of the river should not be attempted by beginners as the rapids are class V and the waterfalls are large enough to drown a man that can't get out from under them in time: people have died here for that reason and never make it to the equally difficult Mather Gorge. The second, western section is close to [[Harper's Ferry]], class III.
* [[Penobscot River]], [[Maine]], Class 3-5
* [[Quaboag River]], Massachusetts, Class 3
* [[Rapid River (Maine)|Rapid River]], [[Maine]], Class 4
* [[Rockaway River]], [[Boonton, New Jersey]], Class 4; only a {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} section can be paddled but the gradient is a {{convert|120|ft|m}} for the mile, with the staircase rapids along Rt. 287 reaching {{convert|40|ft|m}} drop in a quarter of a mile.
* [[Saco River]], New Hampshire, Class 3-4
* [[Swift River (Saco River)|Swift River]], [[New Hampshire]], Class 2-4,  3 sections; Bear Notch Road to Upper Falls, Class 2, Upper Falls to Lower Falls, Class 3, Lower Falls to national forest entrance on [[Kancamagus Highway]], Class 3-4
* [[West River (Vermont)|West River]], [[Vermont]] - class 2-3, Ball Mountain to Salmon Hole, Class 3, Salmon Hole to Route 100, Class 2.
* [[Westfield River]], Massachusetts, Class 1-4; {{convert|40|mi|km}} of varying difficulty including Pork Barrel and Knightville
* [[Winhall River]], [[Vermont]], Class 3
* [[Youghiogheny River]], Pennsylvania/Maryland; Upper Yough (From Sang Run to Friendsville, MD), Class 4-5; Lower Yough (From Ohiopyle, PA, to Bruner's Run), Class 2-4.

===== New York =====
* [[Black River (New York)|Black River]], [[Watertown, New York|Watertown]] - Class III-V
* [[Delaware River]] - Class I-II. Further down the river also has a few rapids as well that can swell to III in wet weather.
* [[Esopus Creek]] - Class II-IV
* [[Genessee River]]
* [[Grasse River]] - Upper section, Class IV - V
* [[Hudson River]], [[North Creek, New York|North Creek]] - Class I-IV. This stretch of the river is nothing like the much tamer brackish portions near [[New York City]].  It is a fast wild ride through a large gorge in a state park.
* Middle Branch [[Oswegatchie River]] - Bryants Bridge and Sluice Falls sections, Class IV - V
* [[Mongaup River]] - Class II-III; about {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}}
* [[Moose River (New York)|Moose River]], [[Old Forge, New York|Old Forge]] - Class IV-V+
* [[Niagara River]] (Whirlpool Rapids) - Class V+, considered by many to be the ultimate whitewater rapids in North America and illegal to kayak in by the laws of both the United States and Canada; this river is listed as one of the 5 deadliest rivers in the world to kayak on and nobody has legally attempted it since the 1980s. The swells below the waterfall can get extremely high and even the most advanced kayakers have lost control and drowned. As one might expect, the [[Niagara Falls|falls]] are not runnable at all and those who attempt to go down them largely die: it is simply not advisable to even attempt it.
* [[Raquette River]] - Class III - IV+
* [[Sacandaga River]], [[Lake Luzerne, New York|Lake Luzerne]]- Class II-III
* [[Salmon River (New York)|Salmon River]] - Class I-III
* [[Tenmile Creek (Catskill Creek)|Ten Mile Creek]] - Class I-III; about {{convert|10|mi|km}}

===== Southeast =====

Some signature streams in the southeastern United States include:

* [[Chattooga River]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] / [[South Carolina]] - sports long, challenging rapids, big drops, and thunderous power; this river can be a challenge for even experts; the Chattooga was one of the rivers used for the filming of the 1973 adventure movie, ''[[Deliverance]]''. It is designated as a Wild and Scenic River and therefore offers beautiful scenery and a wild ride with waterfalls in the trickiest section.
* [[Cheat River]], [[West Virginia]] - Class IV.
* [[French Broad River]], [[Asheville, North Carolina]] - featuring a long run of varying difficulty, from flatwater runnable in a canoe to class IV rapids near Hot Springs, North Carolina and the border with Tennessee. The main drawbacks are that the water tends to be muddy or polluted and it is a natural flow river.
* [[Gauley River]], [[Summersville, West Virginia]] - Nicknamed "The Beast of the East." Has huge rapids, especially at the "Fall Drawdown" (when the reservoir is drained) is a world-class ride; many of them listed as Class V; the Upper Gauley, from Summersville to Mason's Branch, is the tougher section; the [http://www.americanwhitewater.org/rivers/id/2379 Lower Gauley], from Koontz' Flume to Swiss, is still a Class-IV river with significant hazards; navigating the Upper and Lower Gauley in a single day is called "the Gauley Marathon," twenty-six miles of big rapids and paddling.
* [[Green River (North Carolina)|Green River]], [[Asheville, North Carolina]] - the [http://www.americanwhitewater.org/rivers/id/1080 Green Narrows] is the steepest "creek run" with regular activity in the Eastern U.S; with a gradient that reaches 600 feet/mile over one short section, The Narrows is a series of blind waterfalls and tight slots; regular, predictable releases from the Tuxedo Hydro Plant upstream draw paddlers on a regular basis.
* [[James River]], [[Richmond, Virginia]] - Urban whitewater; Class IV. Good for beginners in upper part and a decent river for practice for the more advanced. This river was named for [[James VI and I]] and was one of the first to ever be navigated by British settlers; much farther downriver the water becomes quieter and brackish and leads straight to the spot where the fort of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] was built and the archaeological site still stands.
*[[Linville Gorge]], Western [[North Carolina]] - This runs right through [[Pisgah National Forest]] and has Class V rapids; it is a creek run suitable for kayakers and small canoes but it is too small for rafts. Approximately 17 miles long and not recommended at all for novices as it is one of the most difficult runs in the east. Very steep gorge walls make escape in an accident impossible. Deaths have occurred for those who overestimate their skills. 
* [[Nantahala River]], [[Bryson City, North Carolina]] - a relatively gentle river, with the final rapid having the propensity to send paddlers in for a cold, exhilarating swim; suitable for beginners and families with younger children.
* [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]], [[Thurmond, West Virginia]] - Class III-V natural flow river. Passes through portions of [[Monongahela National Forest]].
* [[Ocoee River]], [[Ducktown, Tennessee]] – Site of 1996 Olympic Slalom Course at the [[Ocoee Whitewater Center]].  A very good river for both novices and more advanced paddlers. Gets its name from ''passiflora incarnata'', the [[maypop]], a very close relative of the commercial [[passionfruit]]  that is a common edible garden plant in the South and was introduced as a source of food to settlers by tribes like the Cherokee. This plant is still found in thickets near the river.
* [[Pigeon River (Tennessee – North Carolina)]], [[Tennessee (U.S. state)|Tennessee]] - class III+ rapids, Dam released river with scheduled releases from Memorial Day to Labor Day. This river runs right through [[Cherokee National Forest]] and is not far from [[Great Smokey Mountains National Park]].
* [[Russell Fork]], this class V river drops {{convert|150|ft|m}} per mile in the [http://www.americanwhitewater.org/rivers/id/2010 Russell Fork Gorge], which has been described as a continuous forty-five degree waterfall; it has dangerous rapids, even experienced paddlers have died in its many undercut rocks, and there have been many close calls; for the most experienced rafters and kayakers only.
* [[Watauga River]], mostly cold and clear water Class I-II rapids with the exception of the [[Bee Cliff (Tennessee)|Bee Cliff Rapids]] following scheduled high volume reservoir releases during summer months from the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] [[Wilbur Dam]] flowing through [[Elizabethton, Tennessee]] (Northeast Tennessee); also upstream of both TVA Wilbur Dam and [[Watauga Dam]] as a separate, non-commercial run beginning in North Carolina to [[Johnson County, Tennessee]] above [[Watauga Lake]]; Class IV-V.

==== West Coast rivers ====

In the western United States, the more noted rivers, such as the [[Grand Canyon]] have much greater water volume and therefore require a different set of paddling skills. Western rafters also navigate many small, low volume rivers, some with much steeper descents than eastern rivers; however, since the mountains are newer in the west, the hazard from undercut rocks, a problem in the east, is replaced by more frequent log jams precipitated by logging activities near the rivers.

The big-water rivers usually do not require the precision paddling of smaller rivers, but have larger rapids and longer wilderness trips due to the greater length and water flow of the big rivers. The smaller rivers and creeks boated by most rafters offer many one- or two-day trips with difficulty levels from I to VI.

In the West, some paddlers start on the American in [[California]] and work their way up to the Rogue and Illinois in [[Oregon]], the Tuolumne (California), the Salmon in [[Idaho]], the Snake, and then the big-water rivers like the Green and Colorado through the Grand Canyon ([[Arizona]]), the Fraser in [[British Columbia]], and many [[Alaska]]n streams.

===== California =====
{{main|List of California rivers}}

Several rivers in California are fed by the snowmelt of the Sierra Nevada mountain range as well as natural springs in high mountainous areas; some rivers flow directly through protected land and foreign visitors should be advised that early spring runs can be very dangerous; the normal classification cranks up much higher turning some runs into death traps for even Olympic level whitewater enthusiasts.

* [[Carson River]]&lt;ref name="CAWW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WW"/&gt;
* [[Cherry Creek (Tuolumne River)|Cherry Creek]]&lt;ref name="CAWW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WW"/&gt; This is easily one of the most difficult rivers in the country. The only way to reach the headwaters is on a hike through [[Stanislaus National Forest]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and large parts of the river should only be attempted by experienced kayakers and canoers.  The water runs through many miles of solid granite rock and has several waterfalls. There are rafting companies that will take visitors on a piece of the river, but they will not permit people to get in the raft until they prove they can swim. Kayakers must be able to eskimo roll and rescue skills strongly recommended for both canoers and kayakers.

Cherry Creek should never be run before the end of May: before that the snowpack is not finished melting and because there is no way out of vertical sections like Cherry Bomb Gorge, a kayaker will most likely die as the water breaches class VI.

* [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]]&lt;ref name="CAWW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WW"/&gt; This is one of the less crowded rivers in California, but by no means should it be ignored. It gets its name from Spanish, ''El Rio de los Santos Reyes'',  or ''River of the Holy Kings'' since Spanish explorers discovered it on the [[Feast of the Epiphany]]. Portions of this river end up in [[Kings Canyon National Park]] and much of the surrounding land is protected. The Middle and South Forks of the River have the most advanced whitewater including the tributary [[Dinkey Creek (California)|Dinkey Creek]] and [[Garlic Falls]], a large series of waterfalls.  Parts of this river are only accessible by horseback or on foot.

===== Colorado and Utah =====
{{main|List of Colorado rivers}}

* [[Animas River]]
* [[Arkansas River]] - a big river, with many sections ranging from Class I to V, very popular with kayakers and with commercial rafting companies. Numerous runs of all difficulty. Probably the most frequently run and one of the best rivers in Colorado. Something for everyone.
* [[Boulder Creek (Colorado)|Boulder Creek]]
* [[Cache La Poudre River]] - Colorado's only federally designated [[Wild and Scenic River]] contains sections appropriate for every level of expertise including an easy Class II section, several Class III and Class-IV sections, as well as some Class V. There is a Class VI waterfall that is very dangerous because the last drop is unrunnable. The water pours off a slab into a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=on}}-wide crack and grinds anything that goes into it.
* [[Clear Creek (Colorado)]]
* [[Colorado River]]
** [[Gore Canyon]] - a Class-IV reach with two significant Class-V rapids. The Gore Canyon run is {{convert|9.5|mi|km}} long and is recommended to be run by advanced kayakers between {{convert|700|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2000|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}.
The first Class V, Gore Rapid, is tighly surrounded by several large Class-IV rapids. Most of the water flows to the river-left side of the rapid, where a very nasty and very sticky hydraulic runs into a large rock. The second Class-V Rapid, Tunnel Rapid, consists mostly of a single large ledge. On the right side of the rapid is a very nasty and very sticky hole that is bordered by a large rock on the left preventing people from exiting. On the left side of the ledge, the water is redirected right back into the large hole. The water is redirected by an undercut rock. Toilet bowl rapid forms a retentive hydraulic. Kirschbaum rapid (Class IV) is harder to scout due to its long runout and difficult travel on river right. Kirschbaum has some excellent waves that can hide holes.
Gore Canyon Classic whitewater race is THE Classic Class Five Whitewater Race in Colorado. Usually held in late August, sponsored and very competitive. Racing divisions consist of various whitewater kayak classes, whitewater raft teams and more.

** ""Pumphouse"": Class III year round {{convert|12|mi|km|adj=on}} reach of river taking out near Rancho del Rio. This meandering run is launched from the Pumphouse BLM facility which lies at the terminus of Gore Canyon. Rapids include Eye of the Needle, Radium and Yarmony.
** I-70 Section - Class-III big water, pushy at times. Dewatered in various sections by the Colorado Division of Water Resources and the water-thirsty inhabitants of the front range.
** "Barrel Springs" - Class IV+ (P) for flows below {{convert|2000|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}, and Class V+ (P) for flows over {{convert|6000|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}. The Barrel Springs run is about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) long and sits between Hanging Lake Dam and the Shoshone Power Plant. The two big rapids are Upper Death (aka: Kayakers Nightmare) and Life After Death, and the last rapid to mention for this run is Barrel Springs rapid.
** ""Shoshone"": When the Colorado River winds through Glenwood Canyon, more mellow kayaking and rafting can be enjoyed for this less than two mile (3 km) run. Shoshone is a popular play run for kayakers and commercial rafting companies. More consistent flows bless Shoshone.
** [[Cataract Canyon]]:  Varies in class from III to V. At over {{convert|50000|ft3/s|m3/s}}, Cataract Canyon becomes class V. The first {{convert|48|mi|km}} from Potash boat ramp are flat water. Four miles (6 km) after the confluence of the Green and Colorado rivers Cataract Canyon begins. Major John Wesley Powell navigated the rapids in 1869 and gave Cataract Canyon its name. Cataract Canyon slices its way through Canyonlands National Park. Prior to becoming a National Park in 1964, Canyonlands and particularly Cataract Canyon was a "no man's land". French-American trapper [[Denis Julien (trapper)|Denis Julien]] made his way up the canyon in 1836 and left his inscription near the confluence or the Green and Colorado Rivers, and at many other places upstream.&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Anderson, Living at the Edge, 1998, Grand Canyon Association. {{ISBN|0-938216-55-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Spring runoff from the [[Uinta Mountains|Uinta]], [[Wasatch Mountains|Wasatch]], and the western fronts of the [[Rocky Mountains]] combines to create some of the most exciting whitewater in North America. Flows have been gauged at over {{convert|110000|cuft/s|m3/s}} in 1984. This is much larger than in the [[Grand Canyon]] where water is released from the [[Glen Canyon Dam]] and therefore regulated. In an average year Cataract Canyon will peak at {{convert|35000|ft3/s|m3/s}} which creates 32 rapids (depending on water levels in Lake Powell). At over {{convert|50000|cuft/s|m3/s}} the rapids from rapid 14 through rapid 24 form some of the most awe inspiring whitewater in North America.

[[File:Imbrium map.png|thumb|right|Detail map of Imbrium's features]]
'''Mare Imbrium''' ([[Latin]] for "'''Sea of Showers'''" or "'''Sea of Rains'''") is a vast [[lunar mare|lava plain]] within the Imbrium Basin on the [[Moon]] and is one of the [[larger craters in the Solar System]]. The Imbrium Basin formed from the collision of a proto-planet during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]]. Basaltic [[lava]] later flooded the giant [[Impact crater|crater]] to form the flat volcanic plain seen today. The basin's age has been estimated using [[Uranium–lead_dating|uranium–lead dating methods]] to 3938 ± 4 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/maps.12395| title = High resolution U-Pb ages of Ca-phosphates in Apollo 14 breccias: Implications for the age of the Imbrium impact| journal = Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science| volume = 49| issue = 12| pages = 2241–2251| year = 2014| last1 = Merle | first1 = R.

T.|bibcode = 2014M&amp;PS...49.2241M }}&lt;/ref&gt; the diameter of the impactor has been estimated to be 250 ± 25&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;P. H. Schultz &amp; D.A. Crawford, ''Origin and implications of non-radial Imbrium Sculpture on the Moon'', Nature '''535''', 391–394 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The Moon's maria (plural of [[Lunar mare|mare]]) have fewer features than other areas of the Moon because molten lava pooled in the craters and formed a relatively smooth surface. Mare Imbrium is not as flat as it was originally because later events have altered its surface.

== Origin ==
Mare Imbrium may have been formed when a proto-planet in the asteroid belt collided with the moon, 3.8 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Peter H.|last2=Crawford|first2=David A.|date=2016-07-21|title=Origin and implications of non-radial Imbrium Sculpture on the Moon|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v535/n7612/full/nature18278.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=535|issue=7612|pages=391–394|doi=10.1038/nature18278|issn=0028-0836|pmid=27443741|bibcode = 2016Natur.535..391S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2016/07/imbrium|title=Asteroid that formed Moon’s Imbrium Basin may have been protoplanet-sized {{!}} News from Brown|website=news.brown.edu|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
With a diameter of 1145&amp;nbsp;km, Mare Imbrium is second only to [[Oceanus Procellarum]] in size among the maria, and it is the largest mare associated with an impact basin.

The Imbrium Basin is surrounded by three concentric rings of mountains, uplifted by the colossal impact event that excavated it. The outermost ring of mountains has a diameter of 1300&amp;nbsp;km and is divided into several different ranges; the [[Montes Carpatus]] to the south, the [[Montes Apenninus]] to the southeast, and the [[Montes Caucasus]] to the east. The ring mountains are not as well developed to the north and west, and it appears they were simply not raised as high in these regions by the Imbrium impact. The middle ring of mountains forms the [[Montes Alpes]] and the mountainous regions near the [[Impact crater|crater]]s [[Archimedes (crater)|Archimedes]] and [[Plato (crater)|Plato]]. The innermost ring, with a diameter of 600&amp;nbsp;km, has been largely buried under the mare's basalt leaving only low hills protruding through the mare plains and mare ridges forming a roughly circular pattern.

The outer ring of mountains rise roughly 7&amp;nbsp;km above the surface of Mare Imbrium. The Mare material is thought to be about 5&amp;nbsp;km deep, giving the Imbrium Basin a total depth of 12&amp;nbsp;km; it is thought that the original crater left by the Imbrium impact was as much as 100&amp;nbsp;km deep, but that the floor of the basin bounced back upwards immediately afterwards.
[[File:Imbrium sculpture Ukert crater 3085 med.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Oblique view of Imbrium Sculpture, with the crater [[Ukert (crater)|Ukert]] right of center]]
[[File:Imbrium sculpture in Montes Haemus.png|thumb|left|200px|Imbrium Sculpture to the southeast of Mare Imbrium, near [[Menelaus (crater)|Menelaus]] crater]]
Surrounding the Imbrium Basin is a region blanketed by [[ejecta]] from the impact, extending roughly 800&amp;nbsp;km outward. Also encircling the basin is a pattern of radial grooves called the "Imbrium Sculpture", which have been interpreted as furrows cut in the Moon's surface by large projectiles blasted out of the basin at low angles, causing them to skim across the lunar surface ploughing out these features. The sculpture pattern was first identified by [[Grove Karl Gilbert]] in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Grove Karl. [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100359666 The moon's face, a study of the origin of its features.] Washington, Philosophical Society of Washington, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a Moon-wide pattern of faults which run both radial to and concentric to the Imbrium basin were thought to have been formed by the Imbrium impact; the event literally shattered the Moon's entire [[lithosphere]]. At the region of the Moon's surface exactly opposite Imbrium Basin, there is a region of chaotic terrain (the crater [[Van de Graaff (crater)|Van de Graaff]]) which is thought to have been formed when the seismic waves of the impact were focused there after travelling through the Moon's interior. Mare Imbrium is about {{convert|750|mi|km}} wide.

A [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]] (mascon), or gravitational high, was identified in the center of Mare Imbrium from Doppler tracking of the five [[Lunar Orbiter program|Lunar Orbiter]] spacecraft in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.161.3842.680 | title = Mascons: Lunar Mass Concentrations | year = 1968 | author = P. M. Muller, W. L.

The mascon was confirmed and mapped at higher resolution with later orbiters such as [[Lunar Prospector]] and [[Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory|GRAIL]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Names==
Like most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Imbrium was named by [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Giovanni Riccioli]], whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known name for the mare may be "The Shrine of [[Hecate]]"; [[Plutarch]] records that the [[Ancient Greeks]] gave this name to the largest of the "hollows and deeps" on the Moon, believing it to be the place where the souls of the deceased were tormented. Ewen A. Whitaker argues that this likely refers to Mare Imbrium, "the largest regular-shaped dark area unbroken by bright patches" that can be seen with the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1600, [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] made a map of the Moon that names Mare Imbrium "Regio Magna Orientalis" (the Large Eastern Region). [[Michael van Langren]]'s 1645 map named it "Mare Austriacum" (the Austrian Sea).&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp.15, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observation and exploration==
Mare Imbrium is visible to the [[naked eye]] from Earth. In the traditional '[[Man in the Moon]]' image seen on the Moon in Western folklore, Mare Imbrium forms the man's right eye.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luna 17 ===
On 17 November 1970 at 03:47 Universal Time, the Soviet spacecraft [[Luna 17]] made a soft landing in the mare, at latitude 38.28 N, and longitude 35.00 W. Luna 17 carried [[Lunokhod 1]], the first [[Rover (space exploration)|rover]] to be deployed on the Moon. Lunokhod 1, a remote-controlled rover, was successfully deployed and undertook a mission lasting several months.

=== Apollo 15 ===
In 1971, the crewed [[Apollo 15]] mission landed in the southeastern region of Mare Imbrium, between [[Hadley–Apennine|Hadley Rille]] and the [[Montes Apenninus|Apennine Mountains]]. Commander [[David Scott]] and Lunar Module Pilot [[James Irwin]] spent three days on the surface of the Moon, including 18½ hours outside the spacecraft on lunar [[extra-vehicular activity]]. Command Module Pilot [[Alfred Worden]] remained in orbit and acquired hundreds of high-resolution photographs of Mare Imbrium (and other regions of the moon) as well as other types of scientific data.  The crew on the surface explored the area using the first [[Lunar Roving Vehicle|lunar rover]] and [[Sample return mission|returned to Earth]] with {{convert|77|kg}} of lunar surface material.  Samples were collected from [[Mons Hadley Delta]], believed to be a fault block of pre-Imbrian ([[Nectarian]] or [[Pre-Nectarian]]) lunar crust, including the "[[Genesis Rock]]."  This was also the only Apollo mission to visit a lunar rille, and to observe outcrops of lunar bedrock visible in the rille wall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/as15psr.pdf Apollo 15 Preliminary Science Report] (NASA SP-289), Scientific and Technical Information Office, NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION, Washington, D.C., 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013 Impact ===
On March 17, 2013, an object hit the lunar surface in Mare Imbrium and exploded in a flash of [[apparent magnitude]] 4.&lt;ref name="impact2013"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Sac hist 008 x.jpg|thumb|right|Route of the first round-the-world nonstop flight by a jet airplane.]]
'''Operation Power Flite''' was a [[United States Air Force]] mission in which three [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]]es became the first [[jet aircraft]] to [[circumnavigation|circle the world]] nonstop, when they made the journey in January 1957 in 45 hours and 19 minutes, using [[Aerial refueling|in-flight refueling]] to stay aloft. The mission was intended to demonstrate that the United States had the ability to drop a [[hydrogen bomb]] anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name=NYT1957/&gt;

==Around the world==
Led by Major General [[Archie J. Old, Jr.]] as flight commander, five B-52B aircraft of the [[93d Air Ground Operations Wing|93rd Bombardment Wing]] of the [[15th Air Force]] took off from [[Castle Air Force Base]] in [[California]] on January 16, 1957, at 1:00 PM, with two of the planes flying as spares. Old was aboard ''Lucky Lady III'' (serial number 53-0394) which was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James H. Morris, who had flown as the co-pilot aboard the ''[[Lucky Lady II]]'' when it made the world's first non-stop circumnavigation in 1949. Heading east, one of the planes was unable to refuel successfully from a [[Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter]] and was forced to land at [[CFB Goose Bay|Goose Bay Air Base]] in [[Labrador]]. The second spare refueled with the rest of the planes over [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]] and then split off as planned to land at [[RAF Brize Norton]] in [[England]].&lt;ref name=USAF&gt;Staff. [http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123006446 "B-52 Stratofortress -- Around the World Flight"], [[United States Air Force]], January 14, 2008. Accessed September 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFHSO/&gt;

After a mid-air refueling rendezvous over [[Saudi Arabia]], the planes followed the coast of [[India]] to [[Sri Lanka]] and then made a simulated bombing drop south of the [[Malay Peninsula]] before heading towards the next air refueling rendezvous over [[Manila]] and [[Guam]]. The three planes continued across the [[Pacific Ocean]] and landed at [[March Joint Air Reserve Base|March Air Force Base]] near [[Riverside, California]] on January 18 after flying for a total of 45 hours and 19 minutes, with the lead plane landing at 10:19 AM and the other two planes following each other separated by 80 seconds. The {{convert|24325|mi}} flight was completed at an average speed of {{convert|525|mph}} and was completed in less than half the time required by ''Lucky Lady II'' when it made the first non-stop circumnavigation in 1949. General [[Curtis LeMay]] was among the 1,000 on hand to greet the three planes, and he awarded all 27 crew members the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. Though Old called the flight "a routine training mission," the Air Force emphasized that the mission demonstrated its "capability to drop a hydrogen bomb anywhere in the world."&lt;ref name=NYT1957&gt;via [[Associated Press]].

''Lucky Lady III'' was one of three similarly named aircraft, each of which was part of an historic circumnavigation on behalf of the United States Air Force:

''Lucky Lady I'' was one of two [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]es that made a round-the-world trip in July/August 1948, flying from and back to [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]] in [[Arizona]], completing the {{convert|20000|mi|km}} flight in 15 days after making eight stops along the way and flying for 103 hours and 50 minutes.&lt;ref name=AFHSO&gt;[http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/ladies.htm Lucky Ladies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907070919/http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/ladies.htm |date=2010-09-07 }}, [[Air Force Historical Studies Office]]. Accessed September 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lucky Lady II'' was a [[Boeing B-50 Superfortress]] of the [[43d Operations Group|43rd Bombardment Group]] with an additional fuel tank added in the bomb bay to provide additional range.  It became the first airplane to circumnavigate the globe nonstop, when it made the journey in 94 hours and one minute in 1949, assisted by refueling the plane in flight.&lt;ref name=NYT19490303&gt;Waggoner, Walter H.

It had been intended to also fly on the [[NPOESS]], for which the NPP was a preparatory project, but the dissolution of that project was announced in 2010. OMPS launched on October 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ozone Suite on Suomi NPP Continues More Than 30 Years of Ozone Data |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/news/omps-active.html |website=NASA |accessdate=7 August 2018 |date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three components of the suite are Nadir, which looks straight down, Limb, which looks down at an angle, and the Main Electronics Box (MEB), which controls Nadir, Limb and communication. Nadir and Limb are on the Suomi NPP, while the MEB is on NOAA-20.&lt;ref name="Joint Mission" /&gt; Nadir itself has two spectrometers: a profiler and a mapper.

A '''paleoburrow''' is an underground shelter ([[tunnel]], [[burrow]], lair, etc.) excavated by extinct paleo-vertebrate [[megafauna]] (i.e., giant mammals, such as [[ground sloths]]) that lived in the [[prehistory|prehistoric era]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufrgs.br/paleotocas/Buchmann_et_al_2003.pdf II Congresso sobre Planejamento e Gestão das Zonas Costeiras dos Países de Expressão Portuguesa] UFRGS - agosto/2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavernas.org.br/anais31cbe/31cbe_541-548.pdf ANAIS do 31º Congresso Brasileiro de Espeleologia] Cavernas.org - agosto/2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJenn-lost"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jenner|first1=Andrew|title=Get Lost in Mega-Tunnels Dug by South American Megafauna|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2017/03/28/paleoburrows-south-america/|website=Discover|publisher=Kalmbach|accessdate=16 April 2017|date=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A crotovina is a paleoburrow filled with sediments (sands, clays, etc.) that have been deposited over the centuries through rainfall and accumulated due to the porosity of the terrain. Generally, fossils found in crotovinas exhibit large proportions similar to known megafauna of their geological period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chc.cienciahoje.uol.com.br/casa-de-preguica/ Casa de preguiça] Ciência Hoje - agosto/2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufrgs.br/paleotocas/Defini%C3%A7%C3%B5es.htm Paleotocas, Crotovinas e Abrigos Subterrâneos] Projeto Paleotoca - UFRGS - agosto/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

After the extinction of the megafauna about 10,000 years ago, some paleoburrows were reused by indigenous human populations. Recent searches indicate that these structures were used as temporary shelters as well as for ritual purposes. In the interior of some paleoburrows, researchers discovered stone tools, ceramic artifacts, human burials, and inscriptions engraved in the walls.

Paleoburrows are classified as paleontological sites; however, if the remains of ancient populations are also found, the site may become the object of research for both paleontologists and archaeologists&lt;ref&gt;{{citar web|url = https://www.academia.edu/5446127/A_Problem%C3%A1tica_das_Galerias_Subterr%C3%A2neas_na_Arqueologia_do_Sul_do_Brasil|título = A Problemática das Galerias Subterrâneas na Arqueologia do Sul do Brasil|data = 2013|acessadoem = |autor = VICROSKI, Fabricio J.

'''Seismo-electromagnetics''' are various [[Electromagnetic radiation|electro-magnetic phenomena]] believed to be generated by tectonic forces acting on the earth's crust, and possibly associated with seismic activity such as earthquakes and volcanoes.  Study of these has been prompted by the prospect they might be generated by the increased stress leading up to an earthquake, and might thereby provide a basis for short-term [[earthquake prediction]]. However, despite many studies, no form of seismo-electromagnetics has been shown to be effective for earthquake prediction. A key problem is that earthquakes themselves produce relatively weak electromagnetic phenomena, and the effects from any precursory phenomena are likely to be too weak to measure. Close monitoring of the [[Parkfield earthquake]] revealed no significant pre-seismic electromagnetic effects. However, some researchers remain optimistic, and searches for seismo-electromagnetic earthquake precursors continue.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==VAN method==

The [[VAN method]] – named after [[Panayotis Varotsos|P. Varotsos]], K. Alexopoulos and K. Nomicos, authors of the 1981 papers describing it&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvs|nb|last1=Varotsos |last2=Alexopoulos |last3=Nomicos |year=1981a|year2=1981b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Varotsos 1984"&gt;{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Alexopoulos|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; – measures low frequency electric signals, termed "seismic electric signals" (SES), by which Varotsos and several colleagues claimed to have successfully [[Earthquake prediction|predicted earthquakes]] in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Kuhlanek|1993}} (preface to a special edition about VAN)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Varotsos 1993"&gt;{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Alexopoulos|Lazaridou|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the method itself and the manner by which successful predictions were claimed have been severely criticized&lt;ref name="Mulargia 1992"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mulargia|Gasperini|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geller 1997 loc=§4.5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Geller|1997|loc=§4.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|ICEF|2011|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; and debated by VAN, but the critics have not retracted their views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lighthill|1996}} (proceedings of a conference that reviewed VAN)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="20_GRL"&gt;twenty articles in a special issue of [[Geophysical Research Letters]] ([http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/grl.v23.11/issuetoc table of contents])&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, the VAN group has introduced a concept they call "natural time", applied to the analysis of their precursors. Initially it is applied on SES to distinguish them from [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]] and relate them to a possible impending earthquake. In case of verification (classification as "SES activity"), natural time analysis is additionally applied to the general subsequent seismicity of the area associated with the SES activity, in order to improve the time parameter of the prediction. The method treats earthquake onset as a [[critical phenomena|critical phenomenon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Varotsos|Sarlis|Skordas|2002}}; {{Harvnb|Varotsos|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rundle et al.|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huang|2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uyeda 2009"&gt;{{Harvnb|Uyeda|Kamogawa|Tanaka|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2006, VAN say that all alarms related to SES activity have been made public by posting at [[arxiv.org]]. One such report was posted on Feb. 1, 2008, two weeks before the largest earthquake in Greece during the period 1983–2011. This earthquake occurred on February 14, 2008, with magnitude ({{M|w|link=y}}) 6.9. VAN's report was also described in an article in the  [[Ethnos (newspaper)|newspaper Ethnos]] on Feb. 10, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Uyeda|Kamogawa|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Uyeda|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Apostolidis|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chouliaras|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gerassimos Papadopolous complained that the VAN reports were confusing and ambiguous, and that "none of the claims for successful VAN predictions is justified."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Papadopoulos|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==QuakeFinder and 'Freund physics'==

In his investigations of crystalline physics, Friedemann Freund found that water molecules embedded in rock can dissociate into ions if the rock is under intense stress. The resulting charge carriers can generate battery currents under certain conditions. Freund suggested that perhaps these currents could be responsible for earthquake precursors such as electromagnetic radiation, earthquake lights and disturbances of the plasma in the ionosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Freund|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of such currents and interactions is known as "Freund physics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hough|2010|pages=133–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most seismologists reject Freund's suggestion that stress-generated signals can be detected and put to use as precursors, for a number of reasons. First, it is believed that stress does not accumulate rapidly before a major earthquake, and thus there is no reason to expect large currents to be rapidly generated. Secondly, seismologists have extensively searched for statistically reliable electrical precursors, using sophisticated instrumentation, and have not identified any such precursors. And thirdly, water in the earth's crust would cause any generated currents to be absorbed before reaching the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hough|2010|pages=137–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[QuakeFinder]] is a company focused on developing  a system for [[earthquake prediction]]. The company has a long-standing collaboration with Freund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QuakeFinder's partnership with the SETI Institute|url=https://www.quakefinder.com/quakefinders-partnership-with-the-seti-institute/|website=QuakeFinder|publisher=QuakeFinder|accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have deployed a network of sensor stations that detect the electromagnetic pulses the team believes precede major earthquakes.&lt;ref name=nyt_upton/&gt; Each sensor is believed to have a range of approximately 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) from the instrument to the source of the pulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/print-edition/2011/03/25/quakefinder-mission-detect-quakes-before.html | title = QuakeFinder's mission: Detect quakes before they shake | date = March 25, 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | author = Lisa Sibley | work = Silicon Valley / San Jose Business Journal | publisher = American Cities Business Journals }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, the company says they have 125 stations in California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quakefinder Blog|url=https://www.quakefinder.com/thank-you-henry-dela-pena/|website=QuakeFinder|accessdate=19 November 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their affiliate Jorge Heraud says he has 10 sites in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heraud|first1=Jorge|title=presenter bio|url=https://exponential.singularityu.org/summit/presenters/jorge-heraud/|website=Singularity University Summit|accessdate=19 November 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using these sensors, Heraud says that he has been able to triangulate pulses seen from multiple sites, in order to determine the origin of the pulses. He said that the pulses are seen beginning from 11 to 18 days before an impending earthquake, and have been used to determine the location and timing of future seismic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heraud|Centa|Bleier|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Enriquez|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, insofar as a verifiable prediction would require a publicly-stated announcement of the location, time, and size of an impending event before its occurrence, neither Quakefinder nor Heraud have yet verifiably predicted an earthquake, much less issued multiple predictions of the type that might be objectively testable for statistical significance.

== Corralitos anomaly ==

In the month prior to the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] measurements of the earth's magnetic field at ultra-low frequencies by a [[magnetometer]] in [[Corralitos, California]], just 7&amp;nbsp;km from the epicenter of the impending earthquake, started showing anomalous increases in amplitude. Just three hours before the quake the measurements soared to about thirty times greater than normal, with amplitudes tapering off after the quake. Such amplitudes had not been seen in two years of operation, nor in a similar instrument located 54&amp;nbsp;km away. To many people such apparent locality in time and space suggested an association with the earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Fraser-Smith|Bernardi|McGill|Ladd|1990| p=1467}} called it "encouraging".&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional magnetometers were subsequently deployed across northern and southern California, but after ten years, and several large earthquakes, similar signals have not been observed.  More recent studies have cast doubt on the connection, attributing the Corralitos signals to either unrelated magnetic disturbance&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Campbell|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, even more simply, to sensor-system malfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|Love|Johnston|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Study of the closely monitored 2004 Parkfield earthquake found no evidence of precusory electromagnetic signals of any type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Park|Dalrymple|Larsen|2007|loc=paragraphs 1 and 32}}. See also {{Harvnb|Johnston|Sasai|Egbert|Mueller|2006|p=S218}} (no VAN-type SES observed) and {{Harvnb|Kappler|Morrison|Egbert|2010}} ("no effects found that can be reasonably characterized as precursors").&lt;/ref&gt;

==ULF magnetic field precursors==

Two recent studies by Konstantinos Eftaxias and his colleagues examined [[Ultra low frequency|ULF]] magnetic fields preceding major earthquakes.

==TEC variations==

Professor Kosuke Heki of [[Hokkaido University]] in [[Japan]] said that he discovered by accident that [[GPS]] signals changed about 40 minutes before the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Reviewing historical data for other earthquakes, he found that this same correlation occurred during other incidents. He suggested that the GPS signals were detecting variations in the levels of the [[Total electron content|TEC (total electron content)]] of the ionosphere in the hour preceding an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;Kosuke Heki, ''Ionospheric electron enhancement preceding the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake,'' Geophysical Research Letters, V. 38, L17312, 5 PP., 2011 
doi:10.1029/2011GL047908 [http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2011/2011GL047908.shtml abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17487482/ BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satellite observations==

The "Detection of Electro-Magnetic Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions" satellite, constructed by [[CNES]], has made observations which show strong correlations between certain types of low frequency electromagnetic activity and the most seismically active zones on the Earth, and have shown a sharp signal in the [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] [[electron]] [[density]] and [[temperature]] near southern Japan seven days before a 7.1 magnitude earthquake occurred there (on August 29 and September 5, 2004, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Quakesat]] is an earth observation [[nanosatellite]] based on 3 [[CubeSat]]s. It was designed to be a proof-of-concept for collecting [[extremely low frequency]] earthquake precursor signals from space. The primary instrument is a [[magnetometer]] housed in a 2-foot (0.6 m) telescoping boom.The science behind the concept is disputed.&lt;ref name=nyt_upton&gt;{{cite news | title = Pursuing the Grail of an Earthquake Predictor, but Facing Skeptics | author = John Upton | date = August 13, 2011 | publisher = [[New York Times]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/us/14bcquakefinder.html | accessdate = 2011-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPERIA is an equatorial space mission mainly concerned with detecting any tectonic and preseismic related signals. More in general, it has been proposed for defining the near-Earth electromagnetic, plasma, and particle environment, and for studying perturbations and instabilities in the ionosphere-[[magnetosphere]] transition region. To study earthquake preparation processes and [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] impacts in the Earth's surface, a phase A study has been realized for the [[Italian Space Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/g2v4612216741003/ | doi=10.1007/3-540-26800-6_65 | title=The ESPERIA Project: a Mission to Investigate the near-Earth Space | journal=Earth Observation with CHAMP | pages=407–412 | last1 = Sgrignal | first1 = Vittorio | last2 = Console | first2 = Rodolfo | last3 = Conti | first3 = Livio | last4 = Moiseev Galper | first4 = Arkady | last5 = Malvezzil | first5 = Valeria | last6 = Parrot | first6 = Michel | last7 = Picozza | first7 = Piergiorgio | last8 = Scrimaglio | first8 = Renato | last9 = Spillantini | first9 = Piero | last10 = Zilpimiani | first10 = David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice (DESDynI) radar satellite, which was canceled in the White House's 2012 budget proposal, would have the capacity to identify elastic strain in tectonic plates, combining [[L-band]] [[interferometric]] synthetic aperture radar and a multi-beam infrared [[lidar]] to detect strains in the Earth’s surface that could lead to serious earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Mark, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703858404576215052041762600?mod=googlenews_wsj "Budget Cuts and the Next Earthquake"], ''Wall Street Journal'', March 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morring Jr., Frank, [http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/asd/2011/03/28/08.xml&amp;headline=Funding%20Uncertainty%20Shaping%20NASA%20Programs "Funding Uncertainty Shaping NASA Programs"], ''Aviation Week'', Mar 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia and the United Kingdom agreed to jointly deploy two satellites in 2015 that will measure electromagnetic signals that are released from the earth's crust prior to earthquakes. The project is said to be able to "help predict earthquakes and potentially save thousands of lives." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbune.com/news/tech/4524-russian-british-scientists-eye-satellites-to-predict-earthquakes.html "Russian, British scientists eye satellites to predict earthquakes"], AHN, February 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Another site of current research is China, where a satellite launch was planned for 2014, to provide data from ionospheric phenomena for comparison with seismo-electromagnetic phenomena on the ground.  Such a link is partially borne out in the current literature, with ionospheric phenomena already shown to precede seismic phenomena by a few hours to days.  The network would potentially show whether such ionospheric phenomena are sourced from ground electrical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shen, Xuhui, Xuemin Zhang, Lanwei Wang, Huaran Chen, Yun Wu, Shigeng Yuan, Junfeng Shen, Shufan Zhao, Jiadong Qian and Jianhai Ding|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/8467463g4g0ruq02/|year=2011|title=The earthquake-related disturbances in ionosphere and project of the first China seismo-electromagnetic satellite|journal=Earthquake Science|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|volume=24|number=6|pages=639–650|doi=10.1007/s11589-011-0824-0|bibcode = 2011EaSci..24..639S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stibiconite''' is an [[antimony]] [[oxide mineral]] with formula: Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH). Its name originates from Greek "stibi" (antimony) and "konis" (powder), alluding to its composition and habit.&lt;ref name=Webmin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt; It is a member of the [[pyrochlore]] super group.

==Discovery and occurrence==
It was first described in 1862 for an occurrence in the Brandholz - Goldkronach District, [[Fichtelgebirge]], [[Franconia]], [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; 

It occurs as a secondary alteration product of other hydrothermal antimony minerals such as [[stibnite]]. It occurs in association with [[cervantite]], [[valentinite]], [[kermesite]], [[native antimony]] and stibnite.&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

'''The Big Four''' or '''The Four Nations''' refer to the four top Allied powers of the [[World War I]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/leaders-of-the-big-four-nations-meet-for-the-first-time-in-paris|title=Leaders of the Big Four nations meet for the first time in Paris|work=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their leaders who met at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in January 1919]]. The Big Four is also known as the Council of Four. It was composed of [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the United States, [[David Lloyd George]] of the [[United Kingdom]], [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]] of [[Italy]], and [[Georges Clemenceau]] of [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolhistory.co.uk/year9links/versailles.shtml|title=Why was the treaty of Versailles so significant? – Rise of Hitler and the Nazi party – Year 9 – SchoolHistory.co.uk|work=schoolhistory.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Woodrow Wilson==
[[File:Thomas Woodrow Wilson, Harris &amp; Ewing bw photo portrait, 1919.jpg|left|thumbnail|[[Portrait photography|Portrait]] of Thomas Woodrow Wilson, 1919.]]

[[Woodrow Wilson]] (28 December 1856 – 3 February 1924) was elected President of the United States on the basis of domestic issues in 1912, and re-elected in 1916. He based his 1916 re-election campaign around the slogan "he kept us out of war", and had worked hard to broker a compromise peace. In early 1917 Berlin decided to launch all-out submarine warfare designed to sink American ships bringing supplies to Britain; in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] it proposed a military alliance with Mexico to fight a war against the US. The nation was poorly armed when it went to war in April 1917, but it had millions of potential fresh soldiers, billions of dollars, and huge supplies of raw materials needed by the Allies.  Officially Wilson kept the US independent of the Allies.  In 1918 Wilson took personal control of negotiations with Germany, including the armistice. He issued his [[Fourteen Points]], his view of a post-war world that could avoid another terrible conflict. It had an enormous impact on both sides in Europe, and made him the man of the hour in Paris. A leader of the Progressive Movement, he assembled a high-powered group of academic advisors to help him in Paris but his distrustful personality led him to break with a series of close advisors, most notably [[Colonel House]]. He made a major blunder by refusing to bring along any prominent Republicans to Paris, which politicised the American debate and weakened his support.  His main goal was a long-term solution to end warfare based on the [[League of Nations]] and self-determination of nations. He paid special attention to creating new nations out of defunct empires, and was opposed to harsh terms and reparations imposed on Germany.  A Presbyterian of deep religious faith, Wilson appealed to a gospel of service and infused a profound sense of moralism into his idealistic internationalism, now referred to as "Wilsonianism". [[Wilsonianism]] calls for the United States to enter the world arena to fight for democracy, and has been a contentious position in American foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;John Milton Cooper, "Woodrow Wilson: A Biography" (2011) ch 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

==David Lloyd George==
[[File:LloydGeorge.jpg|right|thumbnail|David Lloyd George, former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].]]

[[David Lloyd George]], (1863–1945) from the British Liberal Party was a highly effective leader of the coalition government that took power in late 1916 and managed the British war effort. However his coalition premiership was supported more by Conservatives than by his own Liberals, and the subsequent split was a key factor in the decline of the Liberal Party as a serious political force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Jones (civil servant)|Thomas Jones]], ''Lloyd George'' (1951) pp 165–78 [https://www.questia.com/read/24159597/lloyd-george online]&lt;/ref&gt;

He won by a landslide in the election of 1918, held just after the war ended, where he spoke out for harsh terms against Germany. However, he was much more moderate at Paris. Unlike Clemenceau and Orlando, Lloyd George did not want to destroy the German economy and political system—as Clemenceau demanded—with massive reparations. When asked how he had done at the peace conference, he commented, "Not badly, considering I was seated between Jesus Christ and Napoleon [Wilson and Clemenceau]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Dennis Cashman|title=America in the Age of the Titans: The Progressive Era and World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lj_Ra-rITeUC&amp;pg=PA526|year=1988|publisher=NYU Press|page=526|isbn=9780814714119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that "Lloyd George was the most affable and the most resilient, and he was probably the best at negotiating".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;ALAN, R. (16 November 2002). When Peace Did Not Go Unpunished. New York Times. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In an article from the New York Times, it says that "Lloyd George was a pragmatist determined to protect and expand the interests of the British Empire."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Vittorio Emanuele Orlando==
[[File:VittorioEmanuelleOrlando28379v cropped.jpg|left|thumbnail|Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, [[prime minister of Italy]].]]

[[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]] (19 May 1860 – 1 December 1952) was an Italian diplomat and political figure. He was born in Palermo, Sicily. His father, a landed gentleman, delayed venturing out to register his son's birth for fear of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s 1,000 patriots who had just stormed into Sicily on the first leg of their march to build an Italian state. He is commonly nicknamed "The Premier of Victory".

In 1897 he was elected in the Italian [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] (Italian: Camera dei Deputati) for the district of Partinico for which he was constantly re-elected until 1925. He aligned himself with [[Giovanni Giolitti]], who was Prime Minister of Italy five times between 1892 and 1921.

As Prime Minister of Italy, he went to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. He demanded the fulfilment of the "secret [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London of 1915]], by which the Allies had promised Italy ample territorial compensation in Dalmatia for its entry into World War I."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Vittorio Emanuele Orlando. (2011). Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Woodrow Wilson brought forth considerable opposition to Orlando's demands. Therefore, Orlando failed to secure British or French support. This caused him to leave the Peace Conference. However, he returned a month later. "Even then no solution satisfactory to Italy was found; Orlando resigned and was succeeded as premier by Francesco Nitti.  The so-called "[[Mutilated victory]]" was used propaganda in the rise of [[Benito Mussolini]]. Opposing Fascism, Orlando gave up (1925) his seat in parliament and devoted himself to teaching and writing."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Aside from his prominent political role Orlando is also known for his writings, over a hundred works, on legal and judicial issues; Orlando was himself a professor of law.

He was among the fathers of the Republican Constitution being member of the [[Constitutional assembly]] also as speaker of the house. He was a candidate to be the first Italian President elected by the Parliament.

==Georges Clemenceau==
[[File:Georges Clemenceau Imag1396.jpg|right|thumbnail|Image of [[French prime minister]], Georges Clemenceau.]]

[[Georges Benjamin Clemenceau]] (French pronunciation: [ʒɔʁʒ klemɑ̃so]; 28 September 1841 – 24 November 1929) was a French statesman, physician, and journalist. He served as the Prime Minister of France from 1906 to 1909, and again from 1917 to 1920. 
He is commonly nicknamed "Le Tigre" (The Tiger) and "Père-la-Victoire" (Father Victory) for his determination as a wartime leader.

"Succeeding Paul Painlevé as premier in November 1917, Clemenceau formed a coalition cabinet in which he was also minister of war. He renewed the dispirited morale of France, persuaded the allies to agree to a unified command, and pushed the war vigorously until the final victory. Leading the French delegation at the Paris Peace Conference, Clemenceau insisted on Germany's disarmament and was never satisfied with the Versailles Treaty. He was the main antagonist of Woodrow Wilson, whose ideas he viewed as too idealistic."&lt;ref&gt;Georges Clemenceau. (2011). Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly the final year of World War I he led France, and was one of the major voices behind the Treaty of Versailles at the Paris Peace Conference in the aftermath of the war. Clemenceau was hoping that there would be more punishment put on Germany.

==Purpose==
While the Allies at the Paris Peace Conference made up more than twenty nations, the Big Four entered Versailles and were leading architects of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] which was signed by Germany;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/treaty_of_versailles.htm|title=The Treaty of Versailles|work=History Learning Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of St. Germain]], with Austria; the [[Treaty of Neuilly]], with Bulgaria; the [[Treaty of Trianon]], with Hungary; and the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], with the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | authorlink = |author2=Linda Black |author3=Larry S.

During springtime in the polar regions, unique photochemistry converts inert halide salt ions (e.g. Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) into reactive [[halogen]] species (e.g. Br atoms and BrO) that episodically deplete [[ozone]] in the [[atmospheric boundary layer]] to near zero levels.  Since their discovery in the late 1980s, research on these ozone depletion events (ODEs) has shown the central role of
[[bromine]] photochemistry.  Due to the [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]] nature of the reaction mechanism, it has been called bromine explosion. It's still not fully understood how salts are transported from the ocean and oxidized to become reactive halogen species in the air. Other halogens ([[chlorine]] and [[iodine]]) are also activated through mechanisms coupled to bromine chemistry. The main consequence of halogen activation is chemical destruction of ozone, which removes the primary precursor of atmospheric oxidation, and generation of reactive halogen atoms/oxides that become the primary oxidizing species.{{Elucidate|date=November 2013}} The different reactivity of halogens as compared to OH and ozone has broad impacts on [[atmospheric chemistry]], including near complete removal and deposition of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], alteration of oxidation fates for organic gases, and export of bromine into the free [[troposphere]]. Recent changes in the [[climate of the Arctic]] and state of the Arctic sea ice cover are likely to have strong effects on halogen activation and ODEs.

Gilley and T.G. Franti. 2007. Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP): development history, model capabilities, and future enhancements. ''Transactions of the ASABE'' 50(5):1603-1612.&lt;/ref&gt; WEPP requires four inputs, i.e., [[climate]], [[topography]], [[soil]], and management ([[vegetation]]); and provides various types of outputs, including [[water balance]] ([[surface runoff]], [[subsurface flow]], and [[evapotranspiration]]), [[Erosion|soil detachment]] and [[Deposition (chemistry)|deposition]] at points along the slope, [[Sediment transport|sediment delivery]], and vegetation growth. The WEPP model has been improved continuously since its public delivery in 1995, and is applicable for a variety of areas (e.g., [[cropland]], [[rangeland]], [[forestry]], [[fisheries]], and surface [[coal mining]]).

== Capability and strength ==
WEPP is applicable for a wide range of geographic and [[Land use|land-use]] and management conditions, and capable of predicting spatial and temporal distributions of soil detachment and deposition on an event or continuous basis at both small (hillslopes, roads, small parcels) and large ([[Drainage basin|watershed]]) scales.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, D.C., and M.A. Nearing (eds.). 1995.

Kluwer Academic / Plenum Publishers, New York, NY. 145-199&lt;/ref&gt; Hillslope applications of the model can simulate a single profile having various distributions of [[soil]], [[vegetation]], and plant/management conditions. In WEPP watershed applications, multiple hillslopes, [[Stream channel|channels]], and impoundments can be linked together, and [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and [[sediment]] yield from the entire [[Drainage basin|catchment]] predicted. The model has been parameterized for a large number of soils across the U.S. and model performance has been assessed under a wide variety of [[Land use|land-use]] and management conditions.  In addition, WEPP can generate long-term daily climatic data with CLIGEN, an auxiliary [[stochastic]] climate generator.&lt;ref&gt;Nicks, A.D., L.J. Lane, and G.A. Gander. 1995. Weather generator. In: Flanagan, D.C. and M.A. Nearing (eds.), ''USDA-Water Erosion Prediction Project Hillslope Profile and Watershed Model Documentation''. NSERL Rep. 10. West Lafayette, IN: USDA ARS NSERL.&lt;/ref&gt; The CLIGEN database contains weather [[statistics]] from more than 2,600 [[weather station]]s in the United States. The WEPP climate database is supplemented by the [http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/ PRISM database],&lt;ref&gt;Daly, C. 2009. PRISM Group. Available at: http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/.&lt;/ref&gt; which further refines the climatic data based on [[longitude]], [[latitude]], and [[elevation]]. WEPP can provide daily [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[subsurface flow]], and [[sediment]] output categorized into five [[Particle size (grain size)|particle-size]] classes: primary [[clay]], primary [[silt]], small [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]], large [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]], and primary [[sand]], allowing calculation of selective [[sediment transport]], and enrichment of the fine sediment sizes.

== Recent improvement ==
Over the last decade, researchers have made significant improvements to the WEPP model. These include improved [[algorithm]]s to simulate the effect of [[hydraulic structure]]s and impoundments on [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and [[Sediment transport|sediment delivery]],&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J.Q., and S.

''Vadose Zone Journal'' 8(2): 426–436.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of modern graphical user interface programs have also been created, to assist in easier application of WEPP. The main interface for the model is a standalone [[Windows]] application (downloadable via: http://www.ars.usda.gov/Research/docs.htm?docid=10621), that allows a user to simulate hillslope profiles and small watersheds and have full control over all model inputs (Figure 1). Additionally, [http://milford.nserl.purdue.edu web-based interfaces] allow very easy and rapid use of the model while accessing existing [[soil]], [[climate]], and management databases (Figure 2).

== Forest and rangeland applications ==
The [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] has developed a suite of internet [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]], the [http://forest.moscowfsl.wsu.edu/fswepp/ Forest Service WEPP (FS WEPP) interfaces], for easier applications by [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in forest and [[rangeland management]] (forest engineers, rangeland scientists, federal and state regulatory personnel) and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, W.J. 2004. WEPP internet interfaces for forest erosion prediction. ''Journal of the American Water Resources Association'' 40(2): 299–309.&lt;/ref&gt; The interfaces can be readily accessed and run through the internet (http://forest.moscowfsl.wsu.edu/fswepp/), and do not require any in-depth understanding of the [[hydrology]], [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] and [[erosion]] [[principle]]s embedded in the WEPP model. The FS WEPP interfaces include:
* Cross Drain - to predict sediment yield from a road segment across a [[Riparian zone|buffer]]
* Rock:Clime - to create and download a modified WEPP climate file
* WEPP:Road - to predict erosion from a forest road segment
* WEPP:Road Batch - to predict erosion from multiple forest road segments
* Disturbed WEPP - to predict erosion from rangeland and forest disturbances ([[wildfire]], [[Logging|harvest operations]])
* Tahoe Basin Sediment Model (under construction) - to predict runoff and erosion for the [[Lake Tahoe]] Basin
* WEPP FuME (Fuel Management) - to predict erosion from fuel management practices

The '''Witch Tree''' as it is commonly known, also called '''Manidoo-giizhikens''', or '''Little Cedar Spirit Tree''' by the [[Ojibwa]] Indian tribe is an ancient ''[[Thuja occidentalis]]'' growing on the shore of [[Lake Superior]] in [[Cook County, Minnesota|Cook County]], [[Minnesota]].  The earliest written records of the tree by [[Europe]]ans in the Americas are by [[France|French]] explorer [[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye|Sieur de la Verendrye]] in 1731, who commented on the tree as a mature tree at that time, making it over 300 years old.&lt;ref name="SternbergWilson2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Guy Sternberg|author2=James Wesley Wilson|author3=Jim Wilson|title=Native Trees for North American Landscapes: From the Atlantic to the Rockies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOq5v4fd1kcC&amp;pg=PA483&amp;dq=Witch+tree+grand+portage|year=2004|publisher=Timber Press|location=Portland, Ore|isbn=978-0-88192-607-1|page=483}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tree is held [[sacred]] by the Ojibwe, who traditionally leave offerings of [[tobacco]] to ensure a safe journey on Lake Superior.  Due to its sacred nature and vandalism problems in the past, the tree is considered off limits to visitors unless accompanied by a local Ojibwe band member.

The tree is small for a mature [[conifer]], as it is growing out of bare rock on the shoreline.  Its gnarled, stunted, and twisting branches have been the subject of many photographs.
