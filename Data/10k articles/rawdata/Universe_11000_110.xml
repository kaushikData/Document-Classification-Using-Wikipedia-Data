      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2980">'''ANSI C12.19''' is the American National Standard for Utility Industry End Device Data Tables

This standard defines a table structure for utility application data to be passed between an end device and a computer. The "end device" is typically an electricity meter, and the "computer" is typically a hand-held device carried by a meter reader, or a meter communication module which is part of an Automatic Meter Reading system. C12.19 does not define end device design criteria nor specify the language or protocol used to transport that data. There are however related ANSI standards which do specify the transportation of these tables. [[ANSI C12.18]] describes the communication of C12.19 tables over an optical port. [[ANSI C12.21]] describes the communication of C12.19 tables over a modem. [[ANSI C12.22]] describes the communication of C12.19 tables over a network.

The purpose of the tables is to define structures for transporting data to and from end devices. A related standard, [[IEC 61968]] defines a CIM information model for energy data.

==History==
The structures were originally known as the "Tucker Tables" (after Richard Tucker.) The tables were developed under the auspices of the American National Standards Institute, C12, SC17, WG2. The standard is sponsored by NEMA, and also published as MC12.19 and IEEE Std 1377.

Popularity of the tables has grown over the years such that all electric meter vendors in North America now support and use the tables in their products.

The committee (working group 2) is currently chaired by Avygdor Moise and released a revision 2 of the standard in 2008, revision 2.1 of the standard in 2012.

Effective 2014, the object identifiers (device classes) and XML documents (TDLs/EDLs) of this standard are managed and registered by the Energy Communications Management eXchange® (ECMX®) under the supervision of the North American End Device Registration Authority™ (NAEDRA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8828">An '''alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cell''' ('''AAEMFC''') is a type of [[alkaline fuel cell]] that uses an [[anion exchange membrane]] to separate the anode and cathode compartments.

Alkaline fuel cells (AFCs) are based on the transport of alkaline anions, usually [[hydroxide]] {{chem|HO|-}}, between the electrodes.  Original AFCs used  aqueous [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) as an [[electrolyte]].  The AAEMFCs use instead a [[polymer]] membrane that transports hydroxide anions.

This type of [[fuel cell]] is also called '''hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell''' ('''HEMFC'''), '''anion-exchange membrane fuel cell''' ('''AEMFC'''), or '''alkaline membrane fuel cell''' ('''AMFC''').

[[File:AAEMFC.png|thumb|500px|center|Alkaline Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell]]

== Mechanism ==
In an AAEMFC, the fuel, hydrogen or methanol, is supplied at the [[anode]] and oxygen through air, and water are supplied at [[cathode]]. Fuel is oxidized at anode and oxygen is reduced at cathode. At cathode, oxygen reduction produces hydroxides ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) that migrate through the electrolyte towards the anode. At anode, hydroxide ions react with the fuel to produce water and electrons. Electrons go through the circuit producing current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winter|first=M|author2=Brodd, R. J.|title=What are batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors?|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=2004|volume=104|issue=10|pages=4245–4269|doi=10.1021/cr020730k|pmid=15669155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrochemical reactions when hydrogen is the fuel

At Anode: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

At cathode: O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +  2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; →  4OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Electrochemical reactions when methanol is the fuel

At anode: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH  + 6OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  →  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + 5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 6e-

At cathode: 3/2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +  3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 6e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; →  6OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

== Comparison with traditional alkaline fuel cell ==
The alkaline fuel cell used by [[NASA]] in 1960s for [[Apollo program|Apollo]] and Space Shuttle program generated electricity at nearly 70% efficiency using aqueous solution of KOH as an electrolyte. In that situation, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coming in through oxidant air stream and generated as by product from oxidation of methanol, if methanol is the fuel, reacts with electrolyte KOH forming CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;/HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Unfortunately as a consequence, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or KHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; precipitate on the electrodes. However, this effect has found to be mitigated by the removal of cationic counterions from the electrode, and carbonate formation has been found to be entirely reversible by several industrial and academic groups, most notably Varcoe. Low-cost CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems have been developed using air as the oxidant source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US8628889 B2 - Operating method of anion-exchange membrane-type fuel cell|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US20110195323}}&lt;/ref&gt; In alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cell, aqueous KOH is replaced with a solid polymer electrolyte membrane, that can conduct hydroxide ions. This could overcome the problems of electrolyte leakage and carbonate precipitation, though still taking advantage of benefits of operating a fuel cell in an alkaline environment. In AAEMFCs, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with water forming H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which further dissociate to HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. The equilibrium concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;/HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is less than 0.07% and there is no precipitation on the electrodes in the absence of cations (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|last=Adams|first=L. A.|author2=Varcoe, J. R.|journal=Chem Sus Chem|year=2008|volume=1|pages=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|last=Shen|first=P. K.|author2=Xu, C.|journal=Adv. Fuel Cells|year=2005|pages=149–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of cations is, however, difficult to achieve, as most membranes are conditioned to functional hydroxide or bicarbonate forms out of their initial, chemically stable halogen form, and may significantly impact fuel cell performance by both competitively adsorbing to active sites and exerting Helmholtz-layer effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|last=Mills|first=J. N.|author2=McCrum, I. T.|author3=Janik, M. J.|journal=Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.|year=2014|pages=13699–13707|doi=10.1039/c4cp00760c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, against [[alkaline fuel cell]], alkali anion exchange membrane fuel cells also protect the electrode from solid [[carbonate]] precipitation, which can cause fuel (oxygen/hydrogen) transport problem during start-up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electrochem.org/meetings/scheduler/abstracts/214/0783.pdf Anion Exchange Membrane and Ionomer for Alkaline Membrane Fuel Cells] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207233111/http://www.electrochem.org/meetings/scheduler/abstracts/214/0783.pdf |date=December 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The large majority of membranes/ionomer that have been developed are fully hydrocarbon, allowing for much easier catalyst recycling and lower fuel crossover. [[Methanol]] has an advantage of easier storage and transportation and has higher volumetric energy density compared to hydrogen. Also, methanol crossover from anode to cathode is reduced in AAEMFCs compared to PEMFCs, due to the opposite direction of ion transport in the membrane, from cathode to anode. In addition, use of higher alcohols such as ethanol and propanol is possible in AAEMFCs, since anode potential in AAEMFCs is sufficient to oxidize [[C-C bond]]s present in alcohols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Varcoe|first=J. R.|author2=Slade, R. C. T.|title=Prospects for Alkaline Anion-Exchange Membranes in Low Temperature Fuel Cells|journal=Fuel Cells|year=2005|volume=5|pages=187–200|doi=10.1002/fuce.200400045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|last=Shen|first=P. K.|author2=Xu, C.|journal=Adv. Fuel Cells|year=2005|pages=149–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges ===

The biggest challenge in developing AAEMFCs is the anion exchange membrane (AEM). A typical AEM is composed of a polymer backbone with tethered cationic ion-exchange groups to facilitate the movement of free OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions. This is the inverse of [[Nafion]]  used for PEMFCs, where an anion is covalently attached to the polymer and protons hop from one site to another. The challenge is to fabricate AEM with high OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion conductivity and mechanical stability without chemical deterioration at elevated pH and temperatures. The main mechanisms of degradation are [[Hofmann elimination]] when β-hydrogens are present and direct nucleophilic attack by OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion at the cationic site. One approach towards improving the chemical stability towards Hofmann elimination is to remove all β-hydrogens at the cationic site. All these degradation reactions limit the polymer backbone chemistries and the cations that can be incorporated for developing AEM.

Another challenge is achieving OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion conductivity comparable to H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity observed in PEMFCs. Since the diffusion coefficient of OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions is half that of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in bulk water), a higher concentration of OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions is needed to achieve similar results, which in turn needs higher ion exchange capacity of the polymer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Characterization and use of anionic membranes for alkaline fuel cells|last=Agel|first=E|last2=Bouet |first2=J.|first3=J.F |last3=Fauvarque|journal=Journal of Power Sources|year=2001|volume=101|issue=2|pages=267–274|doi=10.1016/s0378-7753(01)00759-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, high ion exchange capacity leads to excessive swelling of polymer on hydration and concomitant loss of mechanical properties.

Management of water in AEMFCs has also been shown to be a challenge. Recent research has shown &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Importance of balancing membrane and electrode water in anion exchange membrane fuel cells|last=Omasta|first=T.J.|last2=Wang |first2=L.|last3=Peng |first3=X.|last4=Lewis|first4=C.A.|last5=Varcoe|first5=J.R.|last6=Mustain|first6=W.E.|journal=Journal of Power Sources|year=2017|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.05.006|volume=375|pages=205–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; that careful balancing of the humidity of the feed gases significantly improves fuel cell performance.

The '''Columbia Non-neutral Torus''' (CNT) is a small [[stellarator]] at the [[Columbia University]] [[Plasma Physics]] Laboratory designed by Thomas Sunn Pedersen with the aid of Wayne Reiersen and Fred Dahlgren of the [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]] to conduct the first investigation of non-neutral plasmas confined on magnetic surfaces. The experiment, which began operation in November 2004, is funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[United States Department of Energy]] in the form of a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award.&lt;ref name="Lyda"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/05/07/story.html |title= Columbia's Stellarator Project Gets Jolt from National Science Foundation |author= Alex Lyda |website= Columbia News |date= 29 July 2005 |quote= For his efforts, Pedersen has been recognized by the [[National Science Foundation]]'s Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program for ground-breaking work in plasma physics.  CAREER offers the National Science Foundation's most prestigious award to the early career-development activities of teacher-scholars who most effectively integrate research and education within the context of the mission of their organization. The award translates to [[United States dollar|$]]800,000 over five years and is expected to begin in September. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical Design ==

CNT, which is housed in a cylindrical [[vacuum chamber]] made of 316 [[stainless steel]], measures 60&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter and stands 75&amp;nbsp;inches tall.  The empty chamber is capable of reaching a pressure of 2x10-10 [[Torr]]. 

CNT is unique in its simple geometry.  Magnetic surfaces are created using only 4 [[electromagnetic coil]]s - two interlocking coils inside the chamber, and two poloidal field coils outside the chamber.  The two interlocking coils have a radius of .405m, and the angle between them can be manually selected to be 64°, 78°, or 88°, allowing for different shear and rotational transform values, and magnetic surface configuration.  The poloidal field coils have a radius of 1.08&amp;nbsp;m.  The coils are powered by a 200&amp;nbsp;kW power supply and are capable of producing [[magnetic fields]] of 0.01-0.2T.  The configuration of CNT creates a very low aspect ratio of 1.9, the lowest of any stellarator built.

Thomas Sunn Pedersen is the principal investigator of CNT, which studies several areas of theoretical and experimental non-neutral plasma physics.  These include the equilibrium of [[Plasma (physics)#Non-neutral plasma|non-neutral plasmas]], [[Magnetorotational Instability|transport]] and confinement, and ion-related [[Plasma stability|instabilities]]. The CNT theory program is run by Pedersen and Prof. Allen Boozer, also at Columbia University.

First studies on CNT showed the successful creation of magnetic
surfaces with the simple four coil design.  At sufficiently low neutral pressures and sufficiently high magnetic field strengths, the plasmas are essentially pure electron plasmas and are [[macroscopic]]ally stable with confinement times of up to 20&amp;nbsp;ms. Transport is driven by collisions with neutrals as well as '''E''' x '''B''' drift along insulating
rods inserted into the plasma. At higher neutral pressures (10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Torr and above), an ion related instability is observed, with a frequency in the 10–50&amp;nbsp;kHz range, and a poloidal mode number m=1.

The CNT group installed a conducting boundary in August 2007
to study its effects on confinement times, and to allow measurements in the absence of internal rods.  Future plans for CNT
include the study of electron-positron plasmas confined on magnetic
surfaces and further studies of partly neutralized plasmas.

'''Commodity product Markup Language''' (CpML) is an industry standard used in wholesale energy trading. CpML is an [[XML]]-based business [[mark-up language]] used for [[Interoperability|interoperable]] representation of energy trades for the purpose of post-deal-execution processes like deal confirmation and regulatory reporting. 

== History and governance ==
CpML 5.0 was first announced in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;Aviv Handler: ''[https://energytradingregulation.com/2013/10/17/cpml-5-0-launched/ CpML 5.0 launched]''. ''Energy Trading Regulation'', dated October 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on previous standards created by [[European Federation of Energy Traders]] (EFET). CpML is governed by the CpML Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;Stella Farrington: ''[http://www.risk.net/energy-risk/feature/2360728/cpml-to-foster-standardisation-among-energy-traders CpML to foster standardisation among energy traders]''. In: ''[[Risk (magazine)|Risk]]'', dated 27 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Stichting|foundation]] under Dutch law created in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stichting]] ''Commodity product Markup Language Foundation'', [[Kamer van Koophandel|KvK]] number 62146432, registered on December 22, 2014 in Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governance Board of the CpML Foundation consisted initially of representatives of [[Électricité de France|EDF Trading]], Freepoint Commodities Europe, [[Gazprom|Gazprom Marketing &amp; Trading]], [[RWE|RWE Supply &amp; Trading]] and EFET.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpml.org/governance.html Governance Board] on website of CpML Foundation, accessed on Sept. 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''compact intracloud discharge''' (CID), also known as a '''narrow bipolar event''' (NBE) or '''narrow bipolar pulse''' (NBP) is an intensive form of [[lightning]] that produces [[radio wave]]s and scarce visible light. Lasting only a few millionths of a second (typically 20 us), these events are the most powerful known natural terrestrial source of radio waves in HF and VHF band. They are not well understood scientifically.

'''Creekology''' is a [[petroleum]] [[prospecting]] method which appeared in the 19th century in [[US]] south gas-oil states. In its simplest form, it was the search for above-ground indications of oil, such as natural seeps.&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/P/PE023.html&lt;/ref&gt; Creekologists also placed wells on singular points of a territory in accordance with landscape features. The placing of wells often occurred near, or on, linear objects - erosion relief forms (valleys, creeks,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energybulletin.net/node/8298&lt;/ref&gt; etc.) - giving rise to the term  ''creekology''. The success rates of some creekologists in the 19th century were very high - 80-90% of their wells gave production and more recent petroleum firms can only dream about such results.

==New creekology==
In the middle of the 20th century some [[geologist]]s formed an idea about existing [[Fault (geology)|fault-fold]] systems in the [[earth's crust]], in sediment cover, and this gave creekology a "scientific base".  Linear forms in earth landscape connect with fault [[tectonics]], and some folds near faults can be reservoirs of [[hydrocarbon]]s. The non-fold types of traps mark by [[Lineation (geology)|lineation]] too (paleo-rivers formed on faults). Now some geologists mark probable gas-oil areas with the help of space image lineation interpreting. This activity can be defined as "new creekology".

'''Cyclone Egon''' was a [[European windstorm]] that affected the north of France, Belgium and Germany during the night of Thursday 12 to Friday 13 January 2017. It caused three deaths, widespread power outages, and wind damage and significant snowfall, primarily France and Germany, but also in the Benelux states, Austria and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="InsJour"&gt;{{cite news|title=Europe's Windstorm Egon to Cost Insurers an Estimated US$223.3M: PERILS|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2017/02/23/442629.htm|accessdate=24 February 2017|publisher=Insurance Journal|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storm was the first to exceed the reporting threshold of €200 million with Perils.org since [[Cyclone Niklas]] in March 2015.&lt;ref name="InsJour"/&gt; The total insured damages were estimated at €275m (final loss report).&lt;ref name="TradingRisk"/&gt;

==Meteorological history==
[[File:Egon storm.gif|thumb|left|Synoptic chart of development of Egon, south of Ireland and path over France and Germany.]]
On 12 January Egon developed unexpectedly from the trailing cold front of the low Dieter centred over Scandinavia.&lt;ref name="DWD"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thema des Tages - Archiv - EGON der Schnellläufer|url=http://www.dwd.de/DE/wetter/thema_des_tages/2017/1/14.html|work=www.dwd.de|publisher=Deutscher Wetterdienst|date=14 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fischer|first1=Jannick|title=Tiefdruckgebiet EGON|url=http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/wetterpate/Lebensgeschichten/Tief_EGON_11_01_17.htm|website=www.met.fu-berlin.de|accessdate=12 November 2017|language=German|date=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Artemis"/&gt; Egon formed to the southwest of Ireland reaching western France by noon that day.&lt;ref name="DWD"/&gt; Egon formed “rather unexpectedly" as a secondary low on a cold front of Windstorm Dieter, before the depression began to deepen quite quickly as it headed for northern France.&lt;ref name="Artemis"/&gt; The development of Egon coincided with a drop in the height of the tropopause especially between Brittany, Belgium and northeastern Germany. In more than 12 hours, the central pressure of the low pressure dropped to 980 hPa in France on 12 January.&lt;ref name="MeteoFrance"/&gt; Satellite water vapour imagery of the low was described as being suggestive of a [[Sting jet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=KeraunosObs |number=819617777354948608 |date=12 January 2017 |title=L'image vapeur d'eau pourrait suggérer le développement d'un sting jet (courant-jet d'occlusion), d'où ces violentes rafales #tempête #Egon |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The highest gust reported in France was in Dieppe which reported {{convert|146|km/h|mph}}, a value not seen there since the [[Great storm of 1987]].&lt;ref name="France24"&gt;{{cite news|title=Violent winter storm lashes northern France - France 24|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20170113-violent-winter-storm-lashes-northern-france-egon|accessdate=12 November 2017|work=France 24|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Caen]] a gust of {{convert|131|km/h|mph}} was reported, the strongest since the passage of [[Cyclone Lothar and Martin|Lothar]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="Keraunos"&gt;{{cite news|title=Forte tempête (Egon) du nord de la France à l'Allemagne les 12 et 13 janvier|url=http://www.keraunos.org/actualites/fil-infos/2017/janvier/tempete-vents-violents-12-13-janvier-depression-egon-orages-gresil-neige-nord-ile-de-france-manche-bretagne-lorraine|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=www.keraunos.org|publisher=Keraunos|date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite locally strong gusts, Egon was not considered by Météo-France to be one of the strongest historical storms to hit France as a whole, describing it as not comparable to the storm Lothar of 1999.&lt;ref name="MeteoFrance"/&gt;

Egon was accompanied by heavy rain and snow in places,&lt;ref name="MeteoFrance"/&gt; with the regions of [[Normandy]] and [[Picardy]] particularly affected,&lt;ref name="France24"/&gt; where Egon caused power outages for over 330,000 households concentrated in these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Storm 'Egon' brings chaotic winter weather to Europe|url=http://www.dw.com/en/storm-egon-brings-chaotic-winter-weather-to-europe/a-37120809|accessdate=24 February 2017|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=13 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong winds from Egon pushed in a significant portion of the west [[rose window]] of [[Soissons Cathedral]] to the northeast of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tempête. La cathédrale de Soissons très endommagée par le vent|url=https://www.ouest-france.fr/meteo/tempete/tempete-la-cathedrale-de-soissons-tres-endommagee-par-le-vent-4732770|accessdate=12 November 2017|work=Ouest-France.fr|date=13 January 2017|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debris from the window landed on the organ causing severe damage.

A unit of the [[Paluel Nuclear Power Plant]], near [[Dieppe]] shut down automatically following the malfunction of a 400,000 volt transmission cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tempête : arrêt d’un réacteur à la centrale nucléaire de Paluel|url=http://www.paris-normandie.fr/breves/normandie/tempete--arret-d-un-reacteur-a-la-centrale-nucleaire-de-paluel-YA8046526|accessdate=12 November 2017|work=www.paris-normandie.fr|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Intempéries : encore 35 000 foyers sans électricité|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/environnement/nature/tempete-11-departements-en-vigilance-neige-et-verglas-fin-de-l-alerte-au-vent-13-01-2017-6562431.php|accessdate=12 November 2017|work=leparisien.fr|date=13 January 2017|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Severe gusts and heavy snowfall caused considerable damage and disruption in northern France and central Germany. Some of the greatest damage was incurred to forestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Catastrophe Recap January 2017|url=http://thoughtleadership.aonbenfield.com/Documents/20170208-ab-analytics-if-january-global-recap.pdf|accessdate=8 March 2017|publisher=Aon Benfield|date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, hurricane-force winds blew on the Saar and Rhineland-Palatinate, uprooting trees and causing power outages. Heavy snowfall covered much of the country and closed the roads, while the German Meteorological Service (DWD) indicated that some areas had received up to 30 cm in a few hours, causing accidents. The airports of Frankfurt, Leipzig and Dresden cancelled their flights. A driver died in an accident, probably because of slippery roads, in Schleswig-Holstein. Another driver was also killed in an accident in Hesse.

On 13 January in [[Kaiserslautern]] the winds of Egon brought down the scaffolding surrounding a high-rise. Hurricane-force gusts from the low Egon swept through the [[Saarland]] on 13 January up to {{convert|126|km/h|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wetter und Klima - Deutscher Wetterdienst   -  Archiv 2017 - Deutschlandwetter im Winter 2016 / 2017|url=http://www.dwd.de/DE/presse/pressemitteilungen/DE/2017/20170227_deutschlandwetter_winter.html?nn=618918|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=www.dwd.de|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electrostatic discharge''' ('''ESD''') is the sudden flow of [[electricity]] between two electrically charged objects caused by contact, an [[short circuit|electrical short]], or [[dielectric breakdown]]. A buildup of [[static electricity]] can be caused by [[tribocharging]] or by [[electrostatic induction]]. The ESD occurs when differently-charged objects are brought close together or when the [[dielectric]] between them breaks down, often creating a visible [[electric spark|spark]].

ESD can create spectacular electric sparks ([[lightning]], with the accompanying sound of [[thunder]], is a large-scale ESD event), but also less dramatic forms which may be neither seen nor heard, yet still be large enough to cause damage to sensitive electronic devices. Electric sparks require a field strength above approximately 40 kV/cm in air, as notably occurs in lightning strikes. Other forms of ESD include [[corona discharge]] from sharp electrodes and [[brush discharge]] from blunt electrodes.

ESD can cause harmful effects of importance in industry, including explosions in gas, fuel vapor and coal dust, as well as failure of solid state [[electronics]] components such as [[integrated circuit]]s.  These can suffer permanent damage when subjected to high voltages.  Electronics manufacturers therefore establish electrostatic protective areas free of static, using measures to prevent charging, such as avoiding highly charging materials and measures to remove static such as grounding human workers, providing [[antistatic device]]s, and controlling humidity.

ESD simulators may be used to test electronic devices, for example with a human body model or a charged device model.

== Causes ==
One of the causes of ESD events is [[static electricity]]. Static electricity is often generated through [[triboelectricity|tribocharging]], the separation of electric charges that occurs when two materials are brought into contact and then separated. Examples of tribocharging  include walking on a rug, rubbing a plastic comb against dry hair, rubbing a balloon against a sweater, ascending from a fabric car seat, or removing some types of plastic packaging. In all these cases, the breaking of contact between two materials results in tribocharging, thus creating a difference of electrical potential that can lead to an ESD event.

Another cause of ESD damage is through [[electrostatic induction]]. This occurs when an electrically charged object is placed near a conductive object isolated from the ground. The presence of the charged object creates an electrostatic field that causes electrical charges on the surface of the other object to redistribute. Even though the net electrostatic charge of the object has not changed, it now has regions of excess positive and negative charges. An ESD event may occur when the object comes into contact with a conductive path. For example, charged regions on the surfaces of [[expanded polystyrene foam|styrofoam]] cups or bags can induce potential on nearby ESD sensitive components via electrostatic induction and an ESD event may occur if the component is touched with a metallic tool.

ESD can also be caused by energetic charged [[particle]]s impinging on an object. This causes increasing surface and deep charging. This is a known [[hazard]] for most [[spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry B. Garrett and Albert C. Whittlesey: Spacecraft charging, an update; IEEE Trans. Plasma Science, 28(6), 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The most spectacular form of ESD is the spark, which occurs when a heavy electric field creates an ionized conductive channel in air. This can cause minor discomfort to people, severe damage to electronic equipment, and fires and explosions if the air contains combustible gases or particles.

However, many ESD events occur without a visible or audible spark. A person carrying a relatively small electric charge may not feel a discharge that is sufficient to damage sensitive electronic components.  Some devices may be damaged by discharges as small as 30&amp;nbsp;V. These invisible forms of ESD can cause outright device failures, or less obvious forms of degradation that may affect the long term reliability and performance of electronic devices.  The degradation in some devices may not become evident until well into their service life.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Sparks ===
{{Main|electric spark}}
A spark is triggered when the [[electric field]] strength exceeds approximately 4–30 kV/cm&lt;ref name="CRC"&gt;CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics&lt;/ref&gt; — the [[dielectric strength|dielectric field strength]] of air. This may cause a very rapid increase in the number of free [[electrons]] and [[ion]]s in the air, temporarily causing the air to abruptly become an electrical [[Conductor (material)|conductor]] in a process called [[dielectric breakdown]].
[[Image:thunder rym.png|350px|thumbnail|Lightning over Rymań. Northern [[Poland]].]]
Perhaps the best known example of a natural spark is [[lightning]].  In this case the [[electric potential]] between a cloud and ground, or between two clouds, is typically hundreds of millions of [[volt]]s. The resulting current that cycles through the stroke channel causes an enormous transfer of [[energy]]. On a much smaller scale, sparks can form in air during electrostatic discharges from charged objects that are charged to as little as 380 V ([[Paschen's law]]).

[[Earth's atmosphere]] consists of 21% [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and 78% [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). During an electrostatic discharge, such as a lightning flash, the affected atmospheric molecules become electrically overstressed.  The [[diatomic]] oxygen molecules are split, and then recombine to form [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is unstable, or reacts with metals and organic matter. If the electrical stress is high enough, [[nitrogen oxide]]s ([[NOx]]) can form. Both products are toxic to animals, and nitrogen oxides are essential for [[nitrogen fixation]]. Ozone attacks all organic matter by [[ozonolysis]] and is used in [[water purification]].

Sparks are an ignition source in combustible environments that may lead to catastrophic explosions in concentrated fuel environments.  Most explosions can be traced back to a tiny electrostatic discharge, whether it was an unexpected combustible fuel leak invading a known open air sparking device, or an unexpected spark in a known fuel rich environment.  The end result is the same if oxygen is present and the three criteria of the [[fire triangle]] have been combined.

== Damage prevention in electronics ==
[[File:Static discharger with plastic guards.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A portion of a [[static discharger]] on an aircraft. Note the two sharp 3/8" metal micropoints and the protective yellow plastic.]]

Many electronic components, especially microchips, can be damaged by ESD. Sensitive components need to be protected during and after manufacture, during shipping and device assembly, and in the finished device. Grounding is especially important for effective ESD control. It should be clearly defined, and regularly evaluated.&lt;ref name="In Compliance Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://incompliancemag.com/article/fundamentals-of-electrostatic-discharge-part-three-basic-esd-control-procedures-and-materials/|title=Fundamentals of Electrostatic Discharge|date=May 1, 2015|publisher=In Compliance Magazine|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Electrostatic-sensitive device|Electrostatic discharge materials}}

===Protection during manufacture===
In manufacturing, prevention of ESD is based on an Electrostatic Discharge Protected Area (EPA). The EPA can be a small workstation or a large manufacturing area. The main principle of an EPA is that there are no highly-charging materials in the vicinity of ESD sensitive electronics, all conductive and dissipative materials are grounded, workers are grounded, and charge build-up on ESD sensitive electronics is prevented. International standards are used to define a typical EPA and can be found for example from [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) or [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI).

ESD prevention within an EPA may include using appropriate ESD-safe packing material, the use of conductive filaments on garments worn by assembly workers, [[conducting wrist strap]]s and foot-straps to prevent high voltages from accumulating on workers' bodies, [[Antistatic mat|anti-static mats]] or conductive flooring materials to conduct harmful electric charges away from the work area, and [[humidity]] control. Humid conditions prevent electrostatic charge generation because the thin layer of moisture that accumulates on most surfaces serves to dissipate electric charges.

Ionizers are used especially when insulative materials cannot be grounded. Ionization systems help to neutralize charged surface regions on insulative or [[dielectric]] materials. Insulating materials prone to triboelectric charging of more than 2,000&amp;nbsp;V should be kept away at least 12 inches from sensitive devices to prevent accidental charging of devices through field induction. On aircraft, [[static discharger]]s are used on the [[trailing edge]]s of wings and other surfaces.

Manufacturers and users of integrated circuits must [https://blog.antistat.com/esd-equipment-that-improves-safety-workplace-protection take precautions to avoid ESD]. ESD prevention can be part of the device itself and include special design techniques for device input and output pins. External protection components can also be used with circuit layout.

Due to dielectric nature of electronics component and assemblies, electrostatic charging can not be completely prevented during handling of devices. Most of ESD sensitive electronic assemblies and components are also so small that manufacturing and handling is done with automated equipment. ESD prevention activities are therefore important with those processes where components come into direct contact with equipment surfaces. In addition, it is important to prevent ESD when an electrostatic discharge sensitive component is connected with other conductive parts of the product itself. An efficient way to prevent ESD is to use materials that are not too conductive but will slowly conduct static charges away. These materials are called static dissipative and have resistivity values below 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; ohm-meters. Materials in automated manufacturing which will touch on conductive areas of ESD sensitive electronic should be made of dissipative material, and the dissipative material must be grounded.

===Protection during transit===
[[Image:Antistatic bag.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[network card]] inside an [[antistatic bag]], a bag made of a partially conductive plastic that acts as a [[Faraday cage]], shielding the card from ESD.]]
Sensitive devices need to be protected during shipping, handling, and storage. The  buildup and discharge of static can be minimized by controlling the surface resistance and volume resistivity of packaging materials. Packaging is also designed to minimize frictional or [[triboelectric]] charging of packs due to rubbing together during shipping, and it may be necessary to incorporate electrostatic or electromagnetic shielding in the packaging material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1421&amp; GR-1421, ''Generic Requirements for ESD-[https://newtophome.info/best-power-strips/ Protective] Circuit Pack Containers''], Telcordia.&lt;/ref&gt;  A common example is that semiconductor devices and computer components are usually shipped in an [[antistatic bag]] made of a partially conductive plastic, which acts as a [[Faraday cage]] to protect the contents against ESD.

==Simulation and testing for electronic devices==
[[Image:electrostatic-discharge.jpg|thumb|right|256px|[[Electric discharge]] showing the ribbon-like [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]
filaments from multiple discharges from a [[Tesla coil]].]]
For testing the susceptibility of electronic devices to ESD from human contact, an [[ESD Simulator]] with a special output circuit, called the [[human body model]] (HBM) is often used. This consists of a [[capacitor]] in series with a [[resistor]]. The capacitor is charged to a specified high voltage from an external source, and then suddenly discharged through the resistor into an electrical terminal of the [[device under test]]. One of the most widely used models is defined in the [[JEDEC]] 22-A114-B standard, which specifies a 100 [[farad|picofarad]] capacitor and a 1,500 [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]] resistor. Other similar standards are [[MIL-STD-883]] Method 3015, and the ESD Association's ESD STM5.1. For comportment to [[European Union]] standards for Information Technology Equipment, [http://www.st.com/web/en/resource/technical/document/application_note/DM00023467.pdf the IEC/EN 61000-4-2 test specification is used].&lt;ref name="iec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baytems.com/docs/LIT-S0017-001.pdf|title=Baytems ESDzap - Lightweight ESD Simulator Product Overview|date=Aug 25, 2012|publisher=Baytems|accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another specification (Schaffner) C = 150&amp;nbsp;pF R = 330&amp;nbsp;Ω that gives high fidelity results. Mostly the theory is there, minimum of the companies measure the real ESD survival rate. Guidelines and requirements are given for test cell geometries, generator specifications, test levels, discharge rate and waveform, types and points of discharge on the "victim" product, and functional criteria for gauging product survivability.

A charged device model (CDM) test is used to define the ESD a device can withstand when the device itself has an electrostatic charge and discharges due to metal contact. This discharge type is the most common type of ESD in electronic devices and causes most of the ESD damages in their manufacturing. CDM discharge depends mainly on parasitic parameters of the discharge and strongly depends on size and type of component package. One of the most widely used CDM simulation test models is defined by the [[JEDEC]].

Other standardized ESD test circuits include the machine model (MM) and transmission line pulse (TLP).

An '''epibiont''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] meaning "living on top of") is an [[organism]] that lives on the surface of another living organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[Derek Briggs]] and [[Peter Crowther]] |year=2001 |title=Palaeobiology II |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |isbn=978-0-632-05149-6 |chapter=Epibionts |first=H.

Although there is no direct effect of the epibiont to the host, there are often indirect effects resulting from this interaction and change in the surface of the host. This has been found to be especially important to [[marine life|marine organisms]] and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s as surface qualities do impact necessary ecological functions such as [[drag (physics)|drag]], radiation [[Absorption (skin)|absorption]], nutrient uptake, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martin Wahl |year=2008 |title=Ecological lever and interface ecology: epibiosis modulates the interactions between host and environment |journal=The Journal of Bioadhesion and Biofilm Research |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=427–38 |doi=10.1080/08927010802339772 |pmid=18686057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of common epibionts are [[barnacle]]s, [[remora]]s, and [[algae]], many of which live on the surfaces of larger marine organisms such as [[whale]]s, [[shark]]s, [[sea turtle]]s, and [[mangrove]] trees. The host of the epibiont is typically referred to as the '''basibiont''' ("living underneath").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gregorio Fernandez-Leborans |author2=Yukio Hanamura |author3=Ryon Siow |author4=Phaik-Ean Chee |year=2009 |title=Intersite epibiosis characterization on dominant mangrove crustacean species from Malaysia |journal=[[Contributions to Zoology]] |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=9–23 |url=http://dpc.uba.uva.nl/ctz/vol78/nr01/art02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
*'''[[Epiphytes]]''' are plants that grow on the surface of other plants.
*'''Epizoic''' organisms are those that live non-parasitically on the surface of animals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/epizoic&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of epizoic species include mosses, algae, and fungi growing on ''[[Gymnopholus]]'' weevils, and [[bryozoan]]s (moss animals) growing on other animals.

The '''esterlin''' is an obsolete [[Netherlands|netherlandic]] [[unit (measurement)|unit]] of [[mass]] and stands for [[gram]]. It also was a unit of mass for [[gold]] in [[France]] weighting 28 ½ [[Grain (unit)|Grain]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaltschmidt, Jacob Heinrich (1870). "''Neuestes und vollständigstes Fremdwörterbuch zur Erklärung aller aus fremden Sprachen entlehnten Wörter und Ausdrücke''"''.''&lt;/ref&gt;
The place of the unit in the netherlandic unit-chain was
* 1 livre or pond/[[Pound (mass)|pound]] = 2 mark = 16 once = 320 e''sterlin'' = 1280 felins = 10240 aß = 1 pond troy of Holland&lt;ref&gt;Homans, Isaac Smith Jr. (1859). "''A cyclopedia of commerce and commercial navigation, with maps and engravings''".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9204">A '''Feynman sprinkler''', also referred to as a '''Feynman inverse sprinkler''' or as a '''reverse sprinkler''', is a [[irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler]]-like device which is submerged in a tank and made to suck in the surrounding [[fluid]].  The question of how such a device would turn was the subject of an intense and remarkably long-lived debate.

A regular sprinkler has [[nozzle]]s arranged at angles on a freely rotating wheel such that when water is pumped out of them, the resulting [[jet (fluid)|jets]] cause the wheel to rotate; both a [[Catherine wheel (firework)|Catherine wheel]] and the [[aeolipile]] ("Hero's engine") work on the same principle.  A "reverse" or "inverse" sprinkler would operate by aspirating the surrounding fluid instead.  The problem is now commonly associated with theoretical [[physics|physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]], who mentions it in his bestselling [[memoir]]s  ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]''  The problem did not originate with Feynman,  nor did he publish a solution to it.

== History ==
[[File:Reaction wheel.pdf|thumb|250px|Illustration 153a from Ernst Mach's ''Mechanik'' (1883). When the hollow rubber ball is squeezed, air flows in the direction of the short arrows and the wheel turns in the direction of the long arrow. When the rubber ball is released, the direction of the flow of the air is reversed but Mach observed "no distinct rotation" of the device.]]

The first documented treatment of the problem is in chapter III, section III of [[Ernst Mach]]'s textbook ''The Science of Mechanics'', first published in 1883.&lt;ref name="Mach1"&gt;Ernst Mach, [http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuViewfull?mode=imagepath&amp;url=/mpiwg/online/permanent/einstein_exhibition/sources/Q179XRYG/pageimg&amp;viewMode=images ''Die Mechanik in Ihrer Entwicklung Historisch-Kritisch Dargerstellt''], (Leipzig: Brockhaus, 1883). Available in English as [https://books.google.com/books?id=IgYADjGcJcAC&amp;pg=PA299 ''The Science of Mechanics: A Critical and Historical Account of its Development''], (Chicago: Open Court, 1919), 4th ed., pp. 299-301.&lt;/ref&gt;  There, Mach reported that the device showed "no distinct rotation."&lt;ref name="Mach2"&gt;Ernst Mach, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IgYADjGcJcAC&amp;pg=PA301 ''The Science of Mechanics: A Critical and Historical Account of its Development''], (Chicago: Open Court, 1919), 4th ed., p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1940s (and apparently without awareness of Mach's earlier discussion), the problem began to circulate among members of the physics department at [[Princeton University]], generating a lively debate.  Richard Feynman, at the time a young graduate student at Princeton, built a makeshift experiment within the facilities of the university's [[cyclotron]] laboratory.  The experiment ended with the explosion of the glass [[carboy]] that he was using as part of his setup.

In 1966, Feynman turned down an offer from the editor of ''[[The Physics Teacher|Physics Teacher]]'' to discuss the problem in print and objected to it being called "Feynman's problem," pointing instead to the discussion of it in Mach's textbook.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Feynman, ''Perfectly Reasonable Deviations From the Beaten Track: The Letters of Richard P. Feynman'', ed. Michelle Feynman, (New York: Basic Books, 2006), pp. 209-211.  {{ISBN|0-465-02371-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sprinkler problem attracted a great deal of attention after the incident was mentioned in ''Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!'', a book of autobiographical reminiscences published in 1985.&lt;ref name="Feynman"&gt;Richard P. Feynman, ''Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!'', (Norton, New York, NY, 1985), pp. 63-65.&lt;/ref&gt;  Feynman neither explained his understanding of the relevant physics, nor did he describe the results of the experiment.  In an article written shortly after Feynman's death in 1988, [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]], who had been his doctoral advisor at Princeton, revealed that the experiment at the cyclotron had shown “a little tremor as the pressure was first applied [...] but as the flow continued there was no reaction.”&lt;ref name="Wheeler"&gt;{{cite journal |author=John A. Wheeler |title=The young Feynman |journal=Physics Today |volume=42 |issue=2 |year=1989 |pages=24–28 |doi=10.1063/1.881189|bibcode = 1989PhT....42b..24W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sprinkler incident is also discussed in [[James Gleick]]'s biography of Feynman, ''Genius,'' published in 1992, where Gleick claims that a sprinkler will not turn at all if made to suck in fluid.&lt;ref name="Gleick"&gt;James Gleick, ''Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman'' (New York: Pantheon, 1992), pp. 106-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, physicist [[Edward Creutz]] (who was in charge of the Princeton cyclotron at the time of the incident) revealed in print that he had assisted Feynman in setting up his experiment and that, when pressure was applied to force water out of the carboy through the sprinkler head,

{{quote|There was a little tremor, as [Feynman] called it, and the sprinkler head rapidly moved back to its original position and stayed there. The water flow continued with the sprinkler stationary. We adjusted the pressure to increase the water flow, about five separate times, and the sprinkler did not move, although water was flowing freely through it in the backwards direction [...] The carboy then exploded, due to the internal pressure. A janitor then appeared and helped me clean up the shattered glass and mop up the water. I don't know what [Feynman] had expected to happen, but my vague thoughts of a time reversal phenomenon were as shattered as the carboy.&lt;ref name="Creutz"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Edward C. Creutz |title=Feynman’s reverse sprinkler |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=73 |issue=3 |year=2005 |pages=198 |doi=10.1119/1.1842733|bibcode = 2005AmJPh..73..198C| author-link=Edward Creutz}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Solution ==
The behavior of the reverse sprinkler is qualitatively quite distinct from that of the ordinary sprinkler, and one does not behave like the other "[[T-symmetry|played backwards]]."  Most of the published theoretical treatments of this problem have concluded that the ideal reverse sprinkler will not experience any torque in its steady state. This may be understood in terms of conservation of angular momentum: in its steady state, the amount of angular momentum carried by the incoming fluid is constant, which implies that there is no torque on the sprinkler itself.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Alejandro Jenkins]] |title=An elementary treatment of the reverse sprinkler |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=72 |issue=10 |year=2004 |pages=1276–1282 |doi=10.1119/1.1761063|arxiv = physics/0312087 |bibcode = 2004AmJPh..72.1276J 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experiments, going back to Mach, find no rotation of the reverse sprinkler.  However, in setups with sufficiently low friction and high rate of inflow, the reverse sprinkler has been seen to turn weakly in the opposite sense to the conventional sprinkler, even in its steady state. Such behavior could be explained by the diffusion of momentum in a non-ideal (i.e., [[viscosity|viscous]]) flow.&lt;ref name="Jenkins2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jenkins |first1=Alejandro|title=Sprinkler head revisited: momentum, forces, and flows in Machian propulsion|journal=European Journal of Physics|volume=32|issue=5|year=2011|pages=1213–1226|issn=0143-0807|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/32/5/009 |arxiv = 0908.3190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, careful observations of the actual behavior of experimental setups show that this turning is associated with the formation of a [[vortex]] inside the body of the sprinkler.&lt;ref name="Rueckner"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolfgang Rueckner |title=The puzzle of the steady-state rotation of a reverse sprinkler |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=83 |issue=296 |year=2015 |doi=10.1119/1.4901816  |bibcode = 2015AmJPh..83..296R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An analysis of the actual distribution of forces and pressure in a non-ideal reverse sprinkler provides the theoretical basis to explain this:

{{quote|Differences in the regions over which internal and external forces act constitute a force-couple with different moment arms consistent with reverse rotation. … the resulting flow-field asymmetry developed downstream from the sprinkler-arm bends supports the role of vortices in reverse sprinkler rotation by suggesting a mechanism for generating vortices in a consistent direction.&lt;ref name="Beals"&gt;

A '''gas meter''' is a specialized [[flow meter]], used to [[measurement|measure]] the volume of [[fuel gas]]es such as [[natural gas]] and [[liquefied petroleum gas]]. Gas meters are used at residential, commercial, and industrial buildings that consume fuel gas supplied by a gas [[public utility|utility]]. Gases are more difficult to measure than liquids, because measured volumes are highly affected by temperature and pressure. Gas meters measure a defined volume, regardless of the pressurized quantity or quality of the gas flowing through the meter. Temperature, pressure, and heating value compensation must be made to measure actual amount and value of gas moving through a meter.

Several different designs of gas meters are in common use, depending on the volumetric flow rate of gas to be measured, the range of flows anticipated, the type of gas being measured, and other factors.

Gas meters that exist in colder climates in buildings built prior to the 1970s were typically located inside the home, typically in the basement or garage. Since then, the vast majority are now placed outside though there are a few exceptions especially in older cities.

[[File:PSM V57 D197 Interior of a common gas meter.png|thumb|upright|A diaphragm type gas meter, cutaway sketch from 1900]]
These are the most common type of gas meter, seen in almost all residential and small commercial installations. Within the meter there are two or more chambers formed by movable [[diaphragm (mechanical device)|diaphragm]]s. With the gas flow directed by internal [[valve]]s, the chambers alternately fill and expel gas, producing a nearly continuous flow through the meter. As the diaphragms expand and contract, levers connected to [[crank (mechanism)|cranks]] convert the linear motion of the diaphragms into rotary motion of a crank shaft which serves as the [[primary flow element]]. This shaft can drive an [[odometer]]-like [[mechanical counter|counter]] mechanism or it can produce electrical pulses for a [[flow computer]].

Diaphragm gas meters are [[positive displacement meter]]s.

===Rotary meters===
[[File:Roots blower - 2 lobes.svg|thumb|upright|Operating principle of a rotary gas meter]]
Rotary meters are highly machined precision instruments capable of handling higher volumes and pressures than diaphragm meters. Within the meter, two figure "8" shaped lobes, the rotors (also known as impellers or pistons), spin in precise alignment. With each turn, they move a specific quantity of gas through the meter. The operating principle is similar to that of a [[Roots-type supercharger|Roots blower]]. The rotational movement of the crank shaft serves as a [[primary flow element]] and may produce electrical pulses for a [[flow computer]] or may drive an odometer-like [[mechanical counter|counter]].

===Turbine meters===
Turbine gas meters infer gas volume by determining the speed of the gas moving through the meter. Because the volume of gas is inferred by the flow, it is important that flow conditions are good. A small internal turbine measures the speed of the gas, which is transmitted mechanically to a mechanical or electronic counter. These meters do not impede the flow of gas, but are limited at measuring lower flow rates.

===Orifice meters===
An orifice gas meter consists of a straight length of pipe inside which a precisely known [[orifice plate]] creates a pressure drop, thereby affecting flow. Orifice meters are a type of differential meter, all of which infer the rate of gas flow by measuring the pressure difference across a deliberately designed and installed flow disturbance. The gas static pressure, density, viscosity, and temperature must be measured or known in addition to the differential pressure for the meter to accurately measure the fluid. Orifice meters often do not handle a large [[turndown ratio|range of flow rates]]. They are however accepted and understood in industrial applications since they are easy to field-service and have no moving parts.

===Ultrasonic flow meters===
[[Ultrasonic flow meter]]s are more complex than meters that are purely mechanical, as they require significant signal processing and computation capabilities. Ultrasonic meters measure the speed of gas movement by measuring the speed at which sound travels in the gaseous medium within the pipe. [[American Gas Association]] Report No. 9 covers the proper usage and installation of these meters, and it specifies a standardised speed-of-sound calculation which predicts the speed of sound in a gas with a known pressure, temperature, and [[gas composition|composition]].

The most elaborate types of ultrasonic flow meters average speed of sound over multiple paths in the pipe. The length of each path is precisely measured in the factory. Each path consists of an ultrasonic transducer at one end and a sensor at the other. The meter creates a 'ping' with the transducer and measures the time elapsed before the sensor receives the sonic pulse. Some of these paths point upstream so that the sum of the times of flight of the sonic pulses can be divided by the sum of the flight lengths to provide an average speed of sound in the upstream direction. This speed differs from the speed of sound in the gas by the velocity at which the gas is moving in the pipe. The other paths may be identical or similar, except that the sound pulses travel downstream. The meter then compares the difference between the upstream and downstream speeds to calculate the velocity of gas flow.

Ultrasonic meters are high-cost and work best with no liquids present at all in the measured gas, so they are primarily used in high-flow, high-pressure applications such as utility pipeline meter stations, where the gas is always dry and lean, and where small proportional inaccuracies are intolerable due to the large amount of money at stake. The [[turndown ratio]] of an ultrasonic meter is probably the largest of any natural gas meter type, and the accuracy and [[turndown ratio|range ability]] of a high-quality ultrasonic meter is actually greater than that of the turbine meters against which they are proven.

Inexpensive varieties of ultrasonic meters are available as clamp-on flow meters, which can be used to measure flow in any diameter of pipe without intrusive modification. Such devices are based on two types of technology: (1) time of flight or transit time; and (2) cross correlation. Both technologies involve transducers that are simply clamped on to the pipe and programmed with the pipe size and schedule and can be used to calculate flow. Such meters can be used to measure almost any dry gas including natural gas, nitrogen, compressed air, and steam. Clamp-on meters are available for measuring liquid flow as well.

===Coriolis meters===
{{Main|Coriolis meter}}
A coriolis meter is usually one or more pipes with longitudinally or axially displaced section(s) that are excited to vibrate at resonant frequency. Coriolis meters are used with liquids and gases. When the fluid within the displaced section is at rest, both the upstream and downstream portion of the displaced section will vibrate in phase with each other. The frequency of this vibration is determined by the overall density of the pipe (including its contents). This allows the meter to measure the flowing density of the gas in real time. Once the fluid begins to flow, however, the [[Coriolis force]] comes into play. This effect implies a relationship between the phase difference in the vibration of the upstream and downstream sections and the mass flow rate of the fluid contained by the pipe.

Again, owing to the amount of inference, analog control and calculation intrinsic to a coriolis meter, the meter is not complete with just its physical components. There are actuation, sensing, electronic, and computational elements that must be present for the meter to function.

Coriolis meters can handle a wide range of flow rates and have the unique ability to output mass flow - this gives the highest accuracy of flow measurement currently available for mass flow measurement. Since they measure flowing density, coriolis meters can also infer gas flow rate at flowing conditions.

American Gas Association Report No. 11 provides guidelines for obtaining good results when measuring natural gas with a coriolis meter.

==Heating value==
The volume of gas flow provided by a gas meter is just that, a reading of volume. Gas volume does not take into account the quality of the gas or the amount of heat available when burned. Utility customers are billed according to the heat available in the gas. The quality of the gas is measured and adjusted for in each billing cycle. This is known by several names as the [[heat of combustion|calorific value]], heating value, or [[therm]] value.

The calorific value of [[natural gas]] can be obtained using a process gas [[chromatography|chromatograph]], which measures the amount of each constituent of the gas, namely:
*[[methane]]
*[[ethane]]
*[[hydrogen]]
*[[carbon monoxide]]
*[[water vapour]]

Additionally, to convert from volume to thermal energy, the [[pressure]] and [[temperature]] of the gas must be taken into consideration. Pressure is generally not a problem; the meter is simply installed immediately downstream of a [[pressure regulator]] and is calibrated to read accurately at that pressure. Pressure compensation then occurs in the utility's billing system. Varying temperature cannot be handled as easily, but some meters are designed with built-in temperature compensation to keep them reasonably accurate over their designed temperature range. Others are corrected for temperature electronically.

==Indicating devices==

Any type of gas meter can be obtained with a wide variety of indicators. The most common are indicators that use multiple clock hands (pointer style) or digital readouts similar to an [[odometer]], but remote readouts of various types are also becoming popular&amp;nbsp;— see [[Automatic meter reading]] and [[Smart meter]].

==Accuracy==

Gas meters are required to register the volume of gas consumed within an acceptable degree of accuracy. Any significant error in the registered volume can represent a loss to the gas supplier, or the consumer being overbilled. The accuracy is generally laid down in statute for the location in which the meter is installed. Statutory provisions should also specify a procedure to be followed should the accuracy be disputed.
 
In the UK, the permitted error for a gas meter manufactured prior to the European Measuring Instruments Directive&lt;ref&gt;European directive (2004/22/EC)&lt;/ref&gt; is ±2%.&lt;ref&gt;the Gas (Meters) Regulations 1983&lt;/ref&gt; However, the European Measuring Instrument Directive has harmonised gas meter errors across Europe and consequently meters manufactured since the directive came into force must read within ±3%. Meters whose accuracy is disputed by the customer have to be removed for testing by an approved meter examiner.&lt;ref&gt;Gas Act 1976, Section 17&lt;/ref&gt; If the meter is found to be reading outside of the prescribed limits, the supplier has to refund the consumer for gas incorrectly measured while that consumer had that meter (but not vice versa). If the meter cannot be tested or its reading is unreliable, the consumer and supplier have to negotiate a settlement. If the meter is found to be reading within limits, the consumer has to pay the costs of testing (and pay any outstanding charges). This contrasts with the position on electric meters, where the test is free and a refund is only given if the date of the meter started reading inaccurately can be determined.

==Remote readouts==
[[File:Gas meter with solid state pulser for remote reading.jpg|thumb|Gas meter with [[solid-state electronics|solid-state]] pulser (left) for remote reading]]
Remote reading is becoming popular for gas meters. It is often done through an electronic pulse output mounted on the meter. There are different styles available but most common is a contact closure switch.

==Flow measurement calculations==

Turbine, rotary, and diaphragm meters can be compensated using a calculation specified in American Gas Association Report No. 7. This standardised calculation compensates the quantity of volume as measured to quantity of volume at a set of [[base conditions]]. The AGA 7 calculation itself is a simple ratio and is, in essence, a density correction approach to translating the volume or rate of gas at [[flow conditions|flowing conditions]] to a volume or rate at [[base conditions]].

Orifice meters are a very commonly used type of meter, and because of their widespread use, the characteristics of gas flow through an orifice meter have been closely studied. American Gas Association Report No. 3 deals with a broad range of issues relating to orifice metering of natural gas, and it specifies an algorithm for calculating natural gas flow rates based on the differential pressure, static pressure, and temperature of a gas with a known composition.

These calculations depend in part on the [[ideal gas law]] and also require a [[compressibility|gas compressibility]] calculation in order to account for the fact that real gases are not ideal. A very commonly used compressibility calculation is American Gas Association Report No. 8, detail characterization.

==Thread sizing standards==
Residential, commercial and industrial gas meters have their own standard thread sizes.  The gas meter is connected to customer piping through a swivel and nut, which has a dedicated set of thread sizes.  These thread sizes were originally named for the amount of gas designed to flow through them in terms of gas lamps, for example a 30-Lt. meter can provide enough gas for 30 lights and was referred to in the late 19th century as a 30-light-gas-meter.&lt;ref&gt;The Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal: Exhibiting a View of the ..., Volume 10. (1880) P. 224&lt;/ref&gt;  These sizes are typically 10Lt, 20Lt, 30Lt, 45Lt, or 60Lt, though smaller and larger sizes are available.  The thread sizes are slightly, about 1/16", larger than the nearest size [[National Pipe Thread|NPT]] size, in order to accommodate the appropriate inner diameter within the swivel.&lt;ref&gt;List of gas meter threads: http://www.gasproductssales.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/swivel-nuts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Israel Union for Environmental Defense''' ({{lang-he|אדם טבע ודין}}, ''Adam Teva veDin'', lit. ''Man Nature and Law''), is an [[environmentalist]] group in [[Israel]].

==Tel Aviv islands==
In November 2002 the [[Israeli Government]] appointed a six-member committee to explore the financial feasibility of creating two islands off the coast of [[Tel Aviv]]. One of the islands would be for an airport, similar to the [[Kobe Airport|Kobe airport]] in Japan, and the other island would have houses, commercial offices and [[tourism]]. Then IUED executive director [[Phil Warburg]] called the proposal a "technological fantasy that is highly improper [because of] Israel’s economic and environmental constraints."&lt;ref name=Fantasy&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=7081 Paradise Or Fantasy?] The Jewish Week, 12 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform was designed by [[United Kingdom|British]] engineering firm SLP Engineering Limited.  The platform also produces the wells Kab 103 and Kab 121. This platform was the site of the accident which eventually led to the death of 22 workers. Pemex would contract two independent studies and one by itself and in an exercise of transparency, post the reports on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pemex.com/index.cfm?action=content&amp;sectionID=119 Seguimiento plataforma Usumacinta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911214054/http://www.pemex.com/index.cfm?action=content&amp;sectionID=119 |date=2008-09-11 }} {{es_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 31, 2008, PEMEX released the result of the independent studies of the accident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pemex.com/index.cfm?action=news&amp;sectionid=8&amp;catid=40&amp;contentid=19082 PEMEX da a conocer los resultados de la investigación interna sobre el accidente en la plataforma Usumacinta, en el Golfo de México] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320085311/http://www.pemex.com/index.cfm?action=news&amp;sectionid=8&amp;catid=40&amp;contentid=19082 |date=2009-03-20 }} {{es_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PozoKab121.jpg|thumb|Usumacinta Platform and Kab 101(under the derrick) the day after the accident.]]
==Usumacinta accident timeline==
October 21, 2007: The [[Jackup rig]] ''Usumacinta'' is moved to the location of Kab 101 to prepare for work on the well Kab 103.

October 23, 2007, 0700: The arrival of Cold Front No. 4 with winds exceeding {{convert|100|km/h|mph}} causes all personnel on the rig to cease operations.

08:00 – 11:00: The Usumacinta begins moving with the {{convert|8|m|ft}} seas, because its ballast and anchor points have not been properly set.

11:30: The Usumacinta's auxiliary cover below its cantilever collides with the wellhead Kab 121, which begins leaking oil and gas.

11:40 – 13:55: The crew of the Usumacinta attempts to close the sub-surface storm valves for both Kab 101 and the leaking Kab 121, to prevent further danger to the people on board the platform.  This is only temporarily successful at stopping the leak from Kab 121.

15:30: The storm valves on Kab 121 fail and [[hydrogen sulfide]] is detected, prompting the order to evacuate the platform.

15:45: All 73 people from the platform were accounted for in the two [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]], and were wearing [[Personal_flotation_device|life jackets]].

==Lifeboat #1==
Around 16:13 the lifeboat began to fill with water.  This eventually led to the lifeboat crew becoming panicked and attempted to leave the lifeboat, in an attempt to board the M/V Morrison Tide. The lifeboat eventually [[Capsizing|capsized]] around 17:28, and a collision between the two lifeboats left most of Lifeboat #1's occupants drifting in the water. Two crew members from the Morrison Tide were lost in rescue operations; one died from injuries and another was lost at sea. Some survivors were also rescued by the M/V Isla Del Torro.

The lifeboat eventually drifted ashore east of [[Nuevo Campechito]] with nobody on board.

==Lifeboat #2==
This lifeboat started out with poor visibility due to the oil from the leaking well Kab 121.  The hatches were opened so the helmsman could see, and to allow for ventilation due to several people complaining of dizziness inside. At 17:42 the lifeboat was struck by a huge wave, and overturned. 33 to 35 people were trapped and had to fight to escape the boat.

The next day Lifeboat #2 reached the shore west of [[Nuevo Progreso, Campeche|Nuevo Progreso]] upside down, with 12 survivors on top, and one survivor and four bodies inside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pemex.com/index.cfm?action=news&amp;sectionID=8&amp;catID=11300&amp;contentID=16231 Relación de personal de la plataforma Usumacinta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912113946/http://www.pemex.com/index.cfm?action=news&amp;sectionID=8&amp;catID=11300&amp;contentID=16231 |date=2008-09-12 }} {{es_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pozo Kab-121-2.jpg|thumb|Usumacinta and Kab 101 being sprayed by Caballo de Mar]]

==Well control and aftermath==
An early estimate of the oil leak from Kab 121 was {{convert|422|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of light crude.  In December 2007 Pemex estimated that {{convert|8701|oilbbl|m3}} of leaked oil were recovered with another 5000 completely lost.

On November 13, during attempts to control the leaks resulting from the accident, the well Kab 121 ignited and was brought under control the same day.  On the 20th of November, Kab 121 ignited again, this time the fire destroyed the remains of the [[Derrick]] and was controlled on December 3.

==Scrappers==
On August 4, 2008, another fire was extinguished on the Usumacinta.  This fire is suspected to have been caused by [[waste picker|scrappers]] attempting to steal from the abandoned rig. This blaze was extinguished by the ships “Isla Guadalupe”, “Isla Cozumel”, “Pionero”, “Conquistador”, and "Deep Endeavour". The [[Mexican Navy]] also sent the interceptor "Auriga" to the area at the request of PEMEX.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yucatan.com.mx/noticia.asp?cx=16$4107070000$3880417&amp;f=20080804 ''Chatarreros'' en alta mar] {{es_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Leyden ball''' is a fictional [[bullet]] used in the nineteenth century [[Jules Verne]] [[science fiction]] novel, ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]''.  It contains a [[capacitance]] charge of [[electricity|electrical energy]], which discharges instantaneously upon the bullet's impact.

A similar, but more complex [[Non-lethal weapon|non-lethal electronic weapon]], meant to disable people, has been developed for police use in the modern day.

== Fictional description ==

In his 1870 science fiction classic ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'', [[Jules Verne]] wrote about a hunting expedition using a very unusual form of bullet:&lt;ref&gt;

[https://archive.org/details/twentythousandle02488gut Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea], A complete, unabridged translation of [[:fr:Vingt mille lieues sous les mers|Vingt milles lieues sous les mers]] by Jules Verne, based on the original French texts published in [[Paris]] by J. Hetzel et Cie. over the period 1869–71. Translated from the Original French by F. P. Walter. Downloadable from the [[Internet Archive]]. Retrieved 2009-04-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;the balls sent by this gun are not ordinary balls, but little cases of glass. These glass cases are covered with a case of steel, and weighted with a pellet of [[lead]]; they are real [[Leyden jar|Leyden bottles]], into which the [[electricity]] is forced to a [[high voltage|very high tension]]. With the slightest shock they are discharged, and the animal, however strong it may be, falls dead.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Verne's novel, the Leyden balls were fired with special [[rifle]]s powered by [[compressed air]]; it was only necessary that they touch the target. It was even possible to use them to bag game flying mere feet above the waves:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was witness to one of the finest gun shots which ever made the nerves of a hunter thrill. A large bird of great breadth of wing, clearly visible, approached, hovering over us. [[Captain Nemo|Captain Nemo's]] companion shouldered his gun and fired, when it was only a few yards above the waves. The creature fell stunned, and the force of its fall brought it within the reach of dexterous hunter's grasp. It was an [[albatross]] of the finest kind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In real life ==

In 2005, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] awarded a development contract for a similar device called a [[Piezer]], described as "an untethered electro-muscular disruption non-lethal stun weapon based on piezoelectric technology for civil law enforcement officers and the military".&lt;ref&gt;

The Extended Range Electronic Projectile, a long range untethered version of a rifle-fired [[Taser]] stun gun underwent trials in 2009.  It was designed to fire non-lethal electronic dart modules at a range up to 20 meters from a 12-bore [[shotgun]].  Upon contact with its target, each dart module electrically shocks its subject for 20 seconds to immobilize it. The energy source for this device, however, is not a capacitor, but rather a conventional dry cell, or "battery".&lt;ref&gt;

'''Livermorium''' is a [[synthetic element|synthetic]] [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Lv''' and has an [[atomic number]] of 116. It is an extremely [[radioactivity|radioactive]] element that has only been created in the laboratory and has not been observed in nature. The element is named after the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in the United States, which collaborated with the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], Russia to discover livermorium during experiments made between 2000 and 2006. The name of the laboratory refers to the city of [[Livermore, California]] where it is located, which in turn was named after the rancher and landowner [[Robert Livermore]]. The name was adopted by [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] on May 30, 2012.&lt;ref name="IUPAC-names-114-116"/&gt; 4 [[isotopes of livermorium]] are known, with [[mass number]]s between 290 and 293 inclusive; the longest-lived among them is livermorium-293 with a [[half-life]] of about 60&amp;nbsp;[[millisecond]]s. A fifth possible isotope with mass number 294 has been reported but not yet confirmed.

In the [[periodic table]], it is a [[p-block]] [[transactinide element]]. It is a member of the [[period 7 element|7th period]] and is placed in group 16 as the heaviest [[chalcogen]], although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to the chalcogen [[polonium]]. Livermorium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues ([[oxygen]], [[sulfur]], [[selenium]], [[tellurium]], and polonium), and be a [[post-transition metal]], although it should also show several major differences from them.

== History ==

=== Unsuccessful synthesis attempts ===
The first search for element 116, using the reaction between &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, was performed in 1977 by Ken Hulet and his team at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL). They were unable to detect any atoms of livermorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.39.385 |title=Search for Superheavy Elements in the Bombardment of &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm with&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca |year=1977 |last=Hulet |first=E. K. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=39 |pages=385–389 |last2=Lougheed |first2=R. |last3=Wild |first3=J. |last4=Landrum |first4=J. |last5=Stevenson |first5=P. |last6=Ghiorso |first6=A. |last7=Nitschke |first7=J. |last8=Otto |first8=R. |last9=Morrissey |first9=D. |last10=Baisden |first10=P. |last11=Gavin |first11=B. |last12=Lee |first12=D. |last13=Silva |first13=R. |last14=Fowler |first14=M. |last15=Seaborg |first15=G. |bibcode=1977PhRvL..39..385H |issue=7 |display-authors=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yuri Oganessian]] and his team at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (FLNR) in the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) subsequently attempted the reaction in 1978 and met failure. In 1985, a joint experiment between Berkeley and Peter Armbruster's team at GSI, the result was again negative with a calculated cross-section limit of 10–100&amp;nbsp;pb. Work on reactions with &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca, which had proved very useful in the synthesis of [[nobelium]] from the &lt;sup&gt;nat&lt;/sup&gt;Pb+&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca reaction, nevertheless continued at Dubna, with a superheavy element separator being developed in 1989, a search for target materials and starting of collaborations with LLNL being started in 1990, production of more intense &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca beams being started in 1996, and preparations for long-term experiments with 3 orders of magnitude higher sensitivity being performed in the early 1990s. This work led directly to the production of new isotopes of elements 112 to 118 in the reactions of &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca with actinide targets and the discovery of the 5 heaviest elements on the periodic table: [[flerovium]], [[moscovium]], livermorium, [[tennessine]], and [[oganesson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.54.406 |title=Attempts to Produce Superheavy Elements by Fusion of &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca with &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm in the Bombarding Energy Range of 4.5–5.2&amp;nbsp;MeV/u |year=1985 |last=Armbruster |first=P. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=54 |pages=406–409 |pmid=10031507 |last2=Agarwal |first2=YK |last3=Brüchle |first3=W |last4=Brügger |first4=M |last5=Dufour |first5=JP |last6=Gaggeler |first6=H |last7=Hessberger |first7=FP |last8=Hofmann |first8=S |last9=Lemmertz |first9=P |last10=Münzenberg |first10=G. |last11=Poppensieker |first11=K. |last12=Reisdorf |first12=W. |last13=Schädel |first13=M. |last14=Schmidt |first14=K. |last15=Schneider |first15=J. |last16=Schneider |first16=W. |last17=Sümmerer |first17=K. |last18=Vermeulen |first18=D. |last19=Wirth |first19=G. |last20=Ghiorso |first20=A. |last21=Gregorich |first21=K. |last22=Lee |first22=D. |last23=Leino |first23=M. |last24=Moody |first24=K. |last25=Seaborg |first25=G. |last26=Welch |first26=R. |last27=Wilmarth |first27=P. |last28=Yashita |first28=S. |last29=Frink |first29=C. |last30=Greulich |first30=N. |issue=5 |bibcode=1985PhRvL..54..406A |display-authors=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, an international team led by [[Sigurd Hofmann]] at the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI) in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]] attempted to synthesise element 116 in a radiative capture reaction (in which the compound nucleus de-excites through pure [[gamma emission]] without evaporating neutrons) between a [[lead]]-208 target and [[selenium]]-82 projectiles. No atoms of element 116 were identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2016/26/epjconf-NS160-06001.pdf |title=The discovery of elements 107 to 112 |last1=Hofmann |first1=Sigurd |date=1 December 2016 |conference=Nobel Symposium NS160 – Chemistry and Physics of Heavy and Superheavy Elements |doi=10.1051/epjconf/201613106001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unconfirmed discovery claims ===
In late 1998, Polish physicist [[Robert Smolańczuk]] published calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of [[superheavy element|superheavy atoms]], including [[oganesson]] and livermorium.&lt;ref name=Smolanczuk&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smolanczuk, R.|journal=[[Physical Review]] C|volume=59|issue=5|date=1999|title=Production mechanism of superheavy nuclei in cold fusion reactions|pages=2634–2639|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.59.2634|bibcode = 1999PhRvC..59.2634S}}&lt;/ref&gt; His calculations suggested that it might be possible to make these two elements by fusing [[lead]] with [[krypton]] under carefully controlled conditions.&lt;ref name=Smolanczuk /&gt;

In 1999, researchers at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] made use of these predictions and announced the discovery of livermorium and oganesson, in a paper published in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'',&lt;ref name="Ninov83.1104"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ninov|first=Viktor|last2=Gregorich|first2=K.|last3=Loveland|first3=W.|last4=Ghiorso|first4=A.|last5=Hoffman|first5=D.|last6=Lee|first6=D.|last7=Nitsche|first7=H.|last8=Swiatecki|first8=W.|last9=Kirbach|first9=U.|first10=C. |last10=Laue|first11=J. |last11=Adams|first12=J. |last12=Patin|first13=D. |last13=Shaughnessy|first14=D. |last14=Strellis|first15=P. |last15=Wilk|title=Observation of Superheavy Nuclei Produced in the Reaction of {{SimpleNuclide|Krypton|86}} with {{SimpleNuclide|Lead|208}}|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=83|pages=1104–1107|date=1999|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.1104|bibcode=1999PhRvL..83.1104N|issue=6 |display-authors=10|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1233919/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and very soon after the results were reported in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Service, R.

The following year, they published a retraction after researchers at other laboratories were unable to duplicate the results and the Berkeley lab itself was unable to duplicate them as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://enews.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/118-retraction.html|publisher=Berkeley Lab|author=Public Affairs Department|title=Results of element 118 experiment retracted|date=2001-07-21|accessdate=2008-01-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129191344/http://enews.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/118-retraction.html|archive-date=2008-01-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2002, the director of the lab announced that the original claim of the discovery of these two elements had been based on data fabricated by principal author [[Victor Ninov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=728–729|title=Misconduct: The stars who fell to Earth|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=420|doi=10.1038/420728a|date=2002|pmid=12490902|last1=Dalton|first1=R.|issue=6917|bibcode = 2002Natur.420..728D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012075515/http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2629 Element 118 disappears two years after it was discovered].

=== Discovery ===
[[File:Curium target livermorium.jpg|thumb|left|Curium-248 target used in the synthesis of livermorium]]
Livermorium was first synthesized on July 19, 2000, when scientists at [[Dubna]] ([[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research|JINR]]) bombarded a [[curium-248]] target with accelerated [[calcium-48]] ions. A single atom was detected, decaying by [[alpha decay|alpha emission]] with [[decay energy]] 10.54&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]] to an isotope of [[flerovium]]. The results were published in December 2000.&lt;ref name=00Og01&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.63.011301|title=Observation of the decay of &lt;sup&gt;292&lt;/sup&gt;116|date=2000|author=Oganessian, Yu.

The [[decay product|daughter]] flerovium isotope had properties matching those of a flerovium isotope first synthesized in June 1999, which was originally assigned to &lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;Fl,&lt;ref name="00Og01"/&gt; implying an assignment of the parent livermorium isotope to &lt;sup&gt;292&lt;/sup&gt;Lv. Later work in December 2002 indicated that the synthesized flerovium isotope was actually &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Fl, and hence the assignment of the synthesized livermorium atom was correspondingly altered to &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;Lv.&lt;ref name="04Og01"/&gt;

=== Road to confirmation ===
Two further atoms were reported by the institute during their second experiment during April–May 2001.&lt;ref name=03Pa01&gt;[https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/302186.pdf "Confirmed results of the &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm(&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca,4n)&lt;sup&gt;292&lt;/sup&gt;116 experiment"], ''Patin et al.'', ''LLNL report (2003)''. Retrieved 2008-03-03&lt;/ref&gt; In the same experiment they also detected a decay chain which corresponded to the first observed decay of [[flerovium]] in December 1998, which had been assigned to &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Fl.&lt;ref name=03Pa01 /&gt; No flerovium isotope with the same properties as the one found in December 1998 has ever been observed again, even in repeats of the same reaction. Later it was found that &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Fl has different decay properties and that the first observed flerovium atom may have been its [[nuclear isomer]] &lt;sup&gt;289m&lt;/sup&gt;Fl.&lt;ref name="00Og01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="04OgJINRPP"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oganessian |first=Yu.

Also in 2009, confirmation from Berkeley and the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI) in Germany came for the flerovium isotopes 286 to 289, immediate daughters of the four known livermorium isotopes.

Superheavy elements are produced by [[nuclear fusion]]. These fusion reactions can be divided into "hot" and "cold" fusion,{{efn|Despite the name, "cold fusion" in the context of superheavy element synthesis is a distinct concept from the idea that nuclear fusion can be achieved in room temperature conditions (see [[cold fusion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-0728(89)80006-3 |title=Electrochemically induced nuclear fusion of deuterium |date=1989 |last1=Fleischmann |first1=Martin |last2=Pons |first2=Stanley |journal=Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry and Interfacial Electrochemistry |volume=261 |issue=2 |pages=301–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} depending on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus produced. In hot fusion reactions, very light, high-energy projectiles are accelerated toward very heavy targets ([[actinide]]s), giving rise to compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40–50&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]]) that may either fission or evaporate several (3 to 5) neutrons.&lt;ref name=fusion&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barber |first1=Robert C. |last2=Gäggeler |first2=Heinz W. |last3=Karol |first3=Paul J. |last4=Nakahara |first4=Hiromichi |last5=Vardaci |first5=Emanuele |last6=Vogt |first6=Erich |title=Discovery of the element with atomic number 112 (IUPAC Technical Report) |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=81 |issue=7 |page=1331 |date=2009 |doi=10.1351/PAC-REP-08-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cold fusion reactions (which use heavier projectiles, typically from the [[period 4 element|fourth period]], and lighter targets, usually [[lead]] and [[bismuth]]), the produced fused nuclei have a relatively low excitation energy (~10–20&amp;nbsp;MeV), which decreases the probability that these products will undergo fission reactions. As the fused nuclei cool to the [[ground state]], they require emission of only one or two neutrons. Hot fusion reactions tend to produce more neutron-rich products because the actinides have the highest neutron-to-proton ratios of any elements that can presently be made in macroscopic quantities.&lt;ref name=AM89&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Armbruster |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Gottfried |last2=Munzenberg |title=Creating superheavy elements |journal=Scientific American |volume=34 |pages=36–42 |date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important information could be gained regarding the properties of superheavy nuclei by the synthesis of more livermorium isotopes, specifically those with a few neutrons more or less than the known ones – &lt;sup&gt;286&lt;/sup&gt;Lv, &lt;sup&gt;287&lt;/sup&gt;Lv, &lt;sup&gt;288&lt;/sup&gt;Lv, &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Lv, &lt;sup&gt;294&lt;/sup&gt;Lv, and &lt;sup&gt;295&lt;/sup&gt;Lv. This is possible because there are many reasonably long-lived [[isotopes of curium]] that can be used to make a target.&lt;ref name=Zagrebaev /&gt; The light isotopes can be made by fusing [[curium-243]] with calcium-48. They would undergo a chain of alpha decays, ending at [[transactinide]] isotopes that are too light to achieve by hot fusion and too heavy to be produced by cold fusion.&lt;ref name=Zagrebaev /&gt;

The synthesis of the heavy isotopes &lt;sup&gt;294&lt;/sup&gt;Lv and &lt;sup&gt;295&lt;/sup&gt;Lv could be accomplished by fusing the heavy curium isotope [[curium-250]] with calcium-48. The [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] of this nuclear reaction would be about 1&amp;nbsp;[[barn (unit)|picobarn]], though it is not yet possible to produce &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cm in the quantities needed for target manufacture.&lt;ref name=Zagrebaev /&gt; After a few alpha decays, these livermorium isotopes would reach nuclides at the line of [[beta decay|beta]] stability. Additionally, [[electron capture]] may also become an important decay mode in this region, allowing affected nuclei to reach the middle of the island. For example, it is predicted that &lt;sup&gt;295&lt;/sup&gt;Lv would alpha decay to &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;[[flerovium|Fl]], which would undergo successive electron capture to &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;Nh and then &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;[[copernicium|Cn]] which is expected to be in the middle of the island of stability and have a half-life of about 1200&amp;nbsp;years, affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology. A drawback is that the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are largely unexplored.&lt;ref name=Zagrebaev /&gt;

Other possibilities to synthesize nuclei on the island of stability include quasifission (partial fusion followed by fission) of a massive nucleus.&lt;ref name=ZG /&gt; Such nuclei tend to fission, expelling doubly [[magic number (physics)|magic]] or nearly doubly magic fragments such as [[calcium-40]], [[tin-132]], [[lead-208]], or [[bismuth-209]].&lt;ref name=jinr20006&gt;{{cite web|title=JINR Annual Reports 2000–2006|url=http://www1.jinr.ru/Reports/Reports_eng_arh.html|publisher=[[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research|JINR]]|accessdate=2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently it has been shown that the multi-nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei (such as [[uranium]] and [[curium]]) might be used to synthesize the neutron-rich superheavy nuclei located at the island of stability,&lt;ref name=ZG&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zagrebaev |first1=V.|last2=Greiner |first2=W.|date=2008|title=Synthesis of superheavy nuclei: A search for new production reactions|journal=[[Physical Review C]]|volume=78 |issue=3 |page=034610|arxiv=0807.2537|bibcode=2008PhRvC..78c4610Z|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.78.034610}}&lt;/ref&gt; although formation of the lighter elements [[nobelium]] or [[seaborgium]] is more favored.&lt;ref name=Zagrebaev /&gt; One last possibility to synthesize isotopes near the island is to use controlled [[nuclear explosion]]s to create a [[neutron flux]] high enough to bypass the gaps of instability at &lt;sup&gt;258–260&lt;/sup&gt;[[fermium|Fm]] and at [[mass number]] 275 (atomic numbers [[rutherfordium|104]] to [[hassium|108]]), mimicking the [[r-process]] in which the [[actinide]]s were first produced in nature and the gap of instability around [[radon]] bypassed.&lt;ref name=Zagrebaev /&gt; Some such isotopes (especially &lt;sup&gt;291&lt;/sup&gt;Cn and &lt;sup&gt;293&lt;/sup&gt;Cn) may even have been synthesized in nature, but would have decayed away far too quickly (with half-lives of only thousands of years) and be produced in far too small quantities (about 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; the abundance of [[lead]]) to be detectable as [[primordial nuclide]]s today outside [[cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref name=Zagrebaev /&gt;

=== Physical and atomic ===
In the [[periodic table]], livermorium is a member of group 16, the chalcogens, in the [[periodic table]], below [[oxygen]], [[sulfur]], [[selenium]], [[tellurium]], and polonium. Every previous chalcogen has six electrons in its valence shell, forming a [[valence electron]] configuration of ns&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;np&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. In livermorium's case, the trend should be continued and the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;7p&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;ref name="Haire" /&gt; therefore, livermorium will have some similarities to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congeners]]. Differences are likely to arise; a large contributing effect is the [[spin–orbit interaction|spin–orbit (SO) interaction]]—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and [[spin (physics)|spin]]. It is especially strong for the superheavy elements, because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms, at velocities comparable to the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref name=Thayer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thayer |first1=John S. |title=Relativistic Effects and the Chemistry of the Heavier Main Group Elements |journal=Relativistic Methods for Chemists |date=2010 |page=83 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9975-5_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to livermorium atoms, it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels (stabilizing the corresponding electrons), but two of the 7p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four.&lt;ref name="Faegri"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faegri |first1=K.|last2=Saue |first2=T.|date=2001|title=Diatomic molecules between very heavy elements of group 13 and group 17: A study of relativistic effects on bonding|journal=[[Journal of Chemical Physics]]|volume=115 |issue=6 |page=2456|bibcode=2001JChPh.115.2456F|doi=10.1063/1.1385366 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the [[inert pair effect]], and the effect "tearing" the 7p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called subshell splitting. Computation chemists see the split as a change of the second ([[azimuthal quantum number|azimuthal]]) [[quantum number]] ''l'' from 1 to {{frac|1|2}} and {{frac|3|2}} for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively: the 7p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; subshell acts as a second inert pair, though not as inert as the 7s electrons, while the 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; subshell can easily participate in chemistry.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;&lt;ref name=Thayer /&gt;{{efn|The quantum number corresponds to the letter in the electron orbital name: 0 to s, 1 to p, 2 to d, etc. See [[azimuthal quantum number]] for more information.}} For many theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as 7s{{su|p=2|w=70%}}7p{{su|b=1/2|p=2|w=70%}}7p{{su|b=3/2|p=2|w=70%}}.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt;

The inert pair effects in livermorium should be even stronger than for polonium and hence the +2 [[oxidation state]] becomes more stable than the +4 state, which would be stabilized only by the most [[electronegative]] [[ligand]]s; this is reflected in the expected [[ionization energy|ionization energies]] of livermorium, where there are large gaps between the second and third ionization energies (corresponding to the breaching of the unreactive 7p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; shell) and fourth and fifth ionization energies.&lt;ref name=BFricke /&gt; Indeed, the 7s electrons are expected to be so inert that the +6 state will not be attainable.&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt; The [[melting point|melting]] and [[boiling point]]s of livermorium are expected to continue the trends down the chalcogens; thus livermorium should melt at a higher temperature than polonium, but boil at a lower temperature.&lt;ref name="B&amp;K" /&gt; It should also be [[density|denser]] than polonium (α-Lv: 12.9&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; α-Po: 9.2&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;); like polonium it should also form an α and a β allotrope.&lt;ref name=BFricke /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like polonium and tellurium are expected to be 1.26 and 1.080 respectively.&lt;ref name=Thayer/&gt;

=== Chemical ===
Livermorium is projected to be the fourth member of the 7p series of [[chemical element]]s and the heaviest member of group 16 in the periodic table, below polonium. While it is the least theoretically studied of the 7p elements, its chemistry is expected to be quite similar to that of polonium.&lt;ref name=BFricke /&gt; The group oxidation state of +6 is known for all the chalcogens apart from oxygen which lacks available d-[[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] for [[expanded octet|expansion]] of its [[octet rule|octet]] and is itself one of the strongest [[redox|oxidizing agents]] among the chemical elements. Oxygen is thus limited to a maximum +2 state, exhibited in the fluoride [[oxygen difluoride|OF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The +4 state is known for [[sulfur]], [[selenium]], [[tellurium]], and polonium, undergoing a shift in stability from reducing for sulfur(IV) and selenium(IV) through being the most stable state for tellurium(IV) to being oxidizing in polonium(IV). This suggests a decreasing stability for the higher oxidation states as the group is descended due to the increasing importance of relativistic effects, especially the inert pair effect.&lt;ref name=Thayer /&gt; The most stable oxidation state of livermorium should thus be +2, with a rather unstable +4 state. The +2 state should be about as easy to form as it is for [[beryllium]] and [[magnesium]], and the +4 state should only be achieved with strongly electronegative ligands, such as in livermorium(IV) fluoride (LvF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt; The +6 state should not exist at all due to the very strong stabilization of the 7s electrons, making the valence core of livermorium only four electrons.&lt;ref name=BFricke /&gt; The lighter chalcogens are also known to form a −2 state as [[oxide]], [[sulfide]], [[selenide]], [[telluride (chemistry)|telluride]], and [[polonide]]; due to the destabilization of livermorium's 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; subshell, the −2 state should be very unstable for livermorium, whose chemistry should be essentially purely cationic,&lt;ref name=Haire /&gt; though the larger subshell and spinor energy splittings of livermorium as compared to polonium should make Lv&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; slightly more stable than expected.&lt;ref name=Thayer /&gt;

Livermorane (LvH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) would be the heaviest [[hydrogen chalcogenide|chalcogen hydride]] and the heaviest homolog of [[water]] (the lighter ones being [[hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]], [[hydrogen selenide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se]], [[hydrogen telluride|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te]], and [[polonium hydride|PoH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]). Polane (polonium hydride) is a more [[covalent]] compound than most metal hydrides because polonium straddles the border between [[metal]]s and [[metalloid]]s and has some nonmetallic properties: it is intermediate between a [[hydrogen halide]] like [[hydrogen chloride]] (HCl) and a [[metal hydride]] like [[stannane]] ([[tin|Sn]]H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Livermorane should continue this trend: it should be a hydride rather than a livermoride, but would still be a covalent [[molecule|molecular]] compound.&lt;ref name=Nash&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nash |first=Clinton S. |last2=Crockett |first2=Wesley W. |date=2006 |title=An Anomalous Bond Angle in (116)H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Marsden A''' was a 250&amp;nbsp;MW oil-fired power station near the [[Marsden Point Oil Refinery]] at [[Marsden Point]], [[Ruakaka]], [[Northland Region|Northland]], New Zealand. It was built in the 1960s, and acted as an emergency reserve power station, serving the load centre of Auckland to the south. It was cooled through a long seawater pipe out into [[Bream Bay]], which is now used to supply an [[Aquaculture in New Zealand|aquaculture industry]] nearby.

Following the commissioning of the dual coal- and gas-fired [[Huntly power station]] in 1982, Marsden A became less used, and it was mothballed in the 1990s due to rising oil prices. One of the generators was subsequently run as a [[synchronous condenser]] to provide reactive power support to [[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]]'s national grid in Northland, but were decommissioned in 2007 when they were superseded by solid state power support devices within Transpower's network.

The facility was owned and operated by [[Mercury Energy|Mighty River Power]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8290">A '''MEPS (Minimum Energy Performance Standard)''' is a specification, containing a number of performance requirements for an [[energy]]-using device, that effectively limits the maximum amount of energy that may be consumed by a product in performing a specified task.

A MEPS is usually made mandatory by a government energy efficiency body. It may include requirements not directly related to energy; this is to ensure that general performance and user satisfaction are not adversely affected by increasing energy efficiency.

A MEPS generally requires use of a particular test procedure that specifies how performance is measured.

In [[North America]] when addressing energy efficiency, a MEPS is sometimes referred to simply as a “standard”, as in “Co-operation on [[Collaborative Labeling and Appliance Standards Program (CLASP)|Labeling and Standards Programs]]”.  In [[Latin America]] when addressing energy efficiency, MEPS are sometimes referred to as ''Normas'' (translated as "norms").

==Examples==
* A [[refrigerator|refrigerating appliance]] is required to maintain [[temperature]]s inside its compartments within specified limits, and to operate (including defrosting) in a specified ambient temperature while using at most a specified amount of [[electricity]]; the energy use allowed varies according to volume, number of doors, the function of the various compartments and other parameters.  This graph shows the dramatic reduction in electricity use in U.S. refrigerators following the introduction of a series of first California then U.S. MEPS starting in the mid-1970s:

[[Image:kwh per frig.jpg|thumb|frame|right|Price, volume and efficiency of refrigerators]]
* An [[electric fan]] is required to shift air at a specified rate while consuming a limited amount of power.
A storage [[water heater]] providing hot water for sanitary purposes is required to heat up a specified quantity of water to a specified temperature and store it at that temperature for a specified time while consuming a limited amount of energy.  In this example, the requirements for heating up and for maintaining the temperature may be applied as two separate energy performance requirements or there may be a single task efficiency. 
* An electric [[induction motor]] is required to have a specified minimum full-load efficiency.
A [[compact fluorescent lamp]] is required to start and run up to near full [[brightness]] in a given time, to have a minimum life of several thousand hours, to maintain its output within specified limits, to withstand a certain number of switchings, to have a consistent colour appearance and a specified colour rendering.  Its energy performance requirement is usually stated in terms of minimum efficacy (light output per electrical input).

==California==
In the U.S., the state of [[California]] was a pioneer &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eceee.org S. Nadel S., 2003, Appliance &amp; equipment efficiency standards in the US: Accomplishments,next steps and lessons learned, ECEEE 2003 Summer Study, St Raphael.&lt;/ref&gt; in the introduction of MEPS. In order to reduce the growth in electricity use, the [[California Energy Commission]] (CEC)  was given unique and strong authority to regulate the efficiency of appliances sold in the state.  It started to adopt appliance efficiency regulations in 1978, and has updated the standards regularly over time, and expanded the list of covered appliances. 

In 1988, California's standards became national standards for the U.S. through the enactment of the [[National Appliance Energy Conservation Act]] (NAECA).  The federal standards preempted state standards (unless the state justified a waiver from federal preemption based on conditions in the state), and since then, the U.S. Department of Energy has had the responsibility to update the federal standards. 

California has continued to expand the list of appliances it regulates for appliances that are not federally regulated, and therefore not preempted.  In recent years,{{When|date=April 2014}} the CEC's attention has been focused on consumer electronics, for which energy use has been growing dramatically.

==Australia==
MEPS programs are made mandatory in [[Australia]] by state government legislation and regulations which give force to the relevant Australian Standards. It is mandatory for the following products manufactured in or imported into Australia to meet the MEPS levels specified by the relevant Australian Standards:

A law was approved in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/Textbase/work/2007/neet_brasilia/Leonelli.pdf Energy Efficiency in Brazil.] Paulo Augusto Leonelli, Brazilian Ministry of Mines and energy. November 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; MEPS have been set for three-phase electric motors and [[compact fluorescent lamps]].

==New Zealand==
On 5 February 2002, [[New Zealand]] introduced Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) with Energy Efficiency Regulations.
MEPS and energy rating labels help improve the energy efficiency of our{{Who|date=April 2014}} products, and enable consumers to choose products that use less energy.  Products covered by MEPS must meet or exceed set levels for energy performance before they can be sold to consumers.
MEPS have been updated over the years (2002, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2011) to cover a wide range of products, and increasing levels of stringency. [[New Zealand]] works with Australia to harmonise MEPS levels. Almost all of its standards are joint standards with Australia.
New Zealand has mandatory Energy rating labelling for dishwashers and clothes dryers, fridges, washing machines and room air conditioners. 
MEPS apply to the following:&lt;ref&gt;Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority of New Zealand http://www.eeca.govt.nz/standards-and-ratings/minimum-energy-performance-standards-and-labelling&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4976">In [[electrical engineering]], '''Neher–McGrath''' is a method of estimating the steady-state temperature of electrical [[power cable]]s for some commonly encountered configurations. By estimating the temperature of the cables, the safe long-term current-carrying capacity of the cables can be calculated. 

J. H.  Neher and M. H. McGrath were two electrical engineers who wrote a paper about how to calculate the capacity of current (ampacity) of cables.&lt;ref name=NM&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J. H. |last1=Neher |first2=M. H. |last2=McGrath |title=The Calculation of the Temperature Rise and Load Capability of Cable Systems |journal=[[AIEE Transactions]] |issue=III |volume=76 |pages=752–772 |date=October 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper described two-dimensional highly symmetric simplified calculations which have formed the basis for many cable application guidelines and regulations. Complex geometries, or configurations that require three-dimensional analysis of heat flow, require more complex tools such as [[finite element analysis]]. Their article became used as reference for the ampacity in most of the standard tables. 

==Overview==
The Neher–McGrath paper summarized years of research into analytical treatment of the practical problem of heat transfer from power cables. The methods described included all the heat generation mechanisms from a power cable (conductor loss, dielectric loss and shield loss).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=George J. |last=Anders |title=Rating of Electric Power Cables: Ampacity Computations for Transmission, Distribution, and Industrial Applications |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=1997 |isbn=0-07-001791-3 |pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the basic principles that [[electric current]] leads to thermal heating and thermal power transfer to the ambient environment requires some temperature difference, it follows that the current leads to a temperature rise in the conductors. The [[ampacity]], or maximum allowable current, of an [[Power cable|electric power cable]] depends on the allowable temperatures of the cable and any adjacent materials such as [[Insulator (electrical)|insulation]] or [[Electrical_termination#Other_meaning|termination]] equipment. For insulated cables, the insulation maximum temperature is normally the limiting material property that constrains ampacity. For uninsulated cables (typically used in overhead installation), the tensile strength of the cable (as affected by temperature) is normally the limiting material property. The Neher–McGrath method is the electrical industry standard for calculating cable ampacity, most often employed via lookup in tables of precomputed results for common configurations.

==US National Electrical Code use==
The equation in section 310-15(C) of the [[National Electrical Code]], called the Neher–McGrath equation (NM) (given below), may be used to estimate the effective ampacity of a cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://lanecoburn.com/images/PurePowerSpring08.pdf |title=Heating |last=Lane |first=Keith |pages=15–19 |journal=Pure Power |publisher=Consulting-Specifying Engineer |issue=Spring 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;I = \sqrt{Tc-(Ta + {\Delta}Td)\over Rdc(1+Yc)Rca}&lt;/math&gt;

In the equation, &lt;math&gt;Tc&lt;/math&gt; is normally the limiting conductor temperature derived from the insulation or tensile strength limitations. &lt;math&gt;{\Delta}TD&lt;/math&gt; is a term added to the ambient temperature &lt;math&gt;Ta&lt;/math&gt; to compensate for heat generated in the jacket and insulation for higher voltages. &lt;math&gt;{\Delta}TD&lt;/math&gt; is called the dielectric loss temperature rise and is generally regarded as insignificant for voltages below 2000&amp;nbsp;V. Term &lt;math&gt;(1+YC)&lt;/math&gt; is a multiplier used to convert [[direct current]] resistance (&lt;math&gt;Rdc&lt;/math&gt;) to the effective alternating current resistance (which typically includes [[Skin effect|conductor skin effects]] and [[eddy current]] losses). For wire sizes smaller than [[American wire gauge|AWG]] No. 2 ({{convert|33.6|mm2|abbr=on|disp=comma}}), this term is generally regarded as insignificant. &lt;math&gt;Rca&lt;/math&gt; is the effective [[thermal resistance]] between the conductor and the ambient conditions, which can require significant empirical or theoretical effort to estimate. With respect to the AC-sensitive terms, tabular presentation of the NM equation results in the National Electrical Code was developed assuming the standard North American power frequency of 60 hertz and sinusoidal wave forms for current and voltage.

The challenges posed by the complexity of estimating RCA and of estimating the local increase in ambient temperature obtained by co-locating many cables (in a [[Electrical_conduit#Underground_conduit|duct bank]]) create a [[Niche market|market niche]] in the electric power industry for software dedicated to ampacity estimation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4630">'''Niles Firebrick''' was manufactured by the Niles [[Fire brick]] Company since it was created in 1872 by John Rhys Thomas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=John Rhys Thomas | url=http://www.ballsplace.com/Ball-HTML/f940.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; until the company was sold in 1953 and completely shutdown in 1960. Capital to establish the company was provided by Lizzie B. Ward to construct a small plant across from the Old Ward Mill&lt;ref name=ruminski&gt;{{cite book | title=Iron Valley | first= Clayton J. | last=Ruminski | year=2017 |publisher=Trillium (Ohio State University) | location=Columbus}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was run by her husband James Ward. Thomas immigrated in 1868 from [[Carmarthenshire]] in Wales with his wife and son [[W. Aubrey Thomas]] who served as secretary of the company until he was appointed as representative to the U. S. Congress in 1904. The company was managed by another son Thomas E. Thomas after J.R. Thomas died unexpectedly in 1898. The Thomases returned the favor of their original capitalization by purchasing an iron blast furnace from James Ward when he went bankrupt in 1879. Using their knowledge of firebrick they were able to make this small furnace profitable. Later they used it to showcase the value of adding hot blast to a furnace using 3 ovens packed full of firebrick. The furnace was managed by another son John Morgan Thomas.

[[Fire brick]] was first invented in 1822 by [[William Weston Young]] in the [[Neath Valley]] of [[Wales]], in the next county east of [[Llanelli]] where the Thomas family lived before emigrating to Niles. It is recorded that Firebrick was made in the Llanelli area in 1870 but the market was highly cyclical and it was difficult to make a living at it. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Pwll Interpretive Panel | url=http://www.llanellich.org.uk/projects/panels/375-pwll-interpretive-panel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1937 to 1941 the company worked to prevent the United Brick Workers Union (CIO) from organizing the workers in preference for an independent union favored by management. The CIO union prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD v. NILES FIRE BRICK CO.| url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5823765557464007436&amp;q=NATIONAL+LABOR+REL.+BOARD+v.+NILES+FIRE+BRICK&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=806&amp;as_vis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this episode the company had good relations with the employees and tried to keep them employed during economic downturns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Oral History Niles Fire Brick | author=Phillip Tomlin | editor=James Allegren | date=Aug 8, 1994 | url=http://www.maag.ysu.edu/oralhistory/cd1/OH1600.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Clingans" mentioned in that referenced interview were Margaret Thomas Clingan, a daughter and John Rhys Thomas Clingan, a grandson, who took over management of the Company when T.E. Thomas died in 1920.

Patrick J. Sheehan worked various jobs at Niles Fire Brick Company from age 13 up until 1897 when he was appointed superintendent of the plant. When Sheehan started with the company they occupied a plant covering a floor space of 3,600 square feet, two kilns, and the output was 640,000 bricks per year. The plant was moved to Langley street eighteen months afterward, and the output increased to 1,200,000. This Langley street works has constantly added to each year, until the output was 6 million and in 1905 they built the "Falcon" plant on the site formerly occupied by the Langley street plant. Which doubled production to 12 million per year.&lt;ref name=upton&gt;{{cite book |title=A twentieth century history of Trumbull County, Ohio |volume=2 |first=Harriet Taylor|last=Upton|authorlink=Harriet Taylor Upton| year=1909 |page=131 |publisher=Lewis Publishing |location=Chicago |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIMUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1955 the output was 25 million.&lt;ref name=pallante2 /&gt; The work of molding and firing brick was highly labor-intensive.

The '''[[parallelogram]] of forces''' is a method for solving (or visualizing) the results of applying two [[force]]s to an object.

[[Image:Vector parallelogram.PNG|thumb|200px|Figure 1: Parallelogram construction for adding vectors]]

When more than two forces are involved, the geometry is no longer parallelogrammatic, but the same principles apply.  Forces, being [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] are observed to obey the laws of [[vector addition]], and so the overall (resultant) force due to the application of a number of forces can be found geometrically by drawing vector arrows for each force. For example, see Figure 1. This construction has the same result as moving '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; so its tail coincides with the head of '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and taking the net force as the vector joining the tail of '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to the head of '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This procedure can be repeated to add '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to the resultant '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and so forth.

== Newton's proof ==
[[File:Parallelogram CDA eq BAC.svg|thumb|Figure 2: Parallelogram of velocity]]

=== Preliminary: the parallelogram of velocity ===
Suppose a [[particle]] moves at a uniform rate along a line from A to B (Figure 2) in a given time (say, one [[second]]), while in the same time, the line AB moves uniformly from its position at AB to a position at DC, remaining parallel to its original orientation throughout. Accounting for both motions, the particle traces the line AC. Because a displacement in a given time is a measure of [[velocity]], the length of AB is a measure of the particle's velocity along AB, the length of AD is a measure of the line's velocity along AD, and the length of AC is a measure of the particle's velocity along AC. The particle's motion is the same as if it had moved with a single velocity along AC.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Newton's proof of the parallelogram of force ===
Suppose two [[force]]s act on a [[particle]] at the origin (the "tails" of the [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s) of Figure 1. Let the lengths of the vectors '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represent the [[velocity|velocities]] the two forces could produce in the particle by acting for a given time, and let the direction of each represent the direction in which they act. Each force acts independently and will produce its particular velocity whether the other force acts or not. At the end of the given time, the particle has ''both'' velocities. By the above proof, they are equivalent to a single velocity, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt;. By [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]], this vector is also a measure of the force which would produce that velocity, thus the two forces are equivalent to a single force.&lt;ref&gt;
Routh (1896), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Parallelogram of forces - ball on slope.pdf|thumb|Using a parallelogram to add the forces acting on a particle on a smooth slope. We find, as we'd expect, that the resultant (double headed arrow) force acts down the slope, which will cause the particle to accelerate in that direction.]]

== Bernoulli's proof for perpendicular vectors==
&lt;!--A version of the proof provided in Spivak attributed to Bernoulli--&gt;
&lt;!--TODO: This section could use nice graphics --&gt;

We model forces as Euclidean vectors or members of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Our first assumption is that the resultant of two forces is in fact another force, so that for any two forces &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}, \mathbf{G} \in \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt; there is another force &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} \oplus \mathbf{G} \in \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- Delete comment tags if used.
We assume commutativity, as these are forces being applied concurrently, so the order shouldn't matter &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} \oplus \mathbf{G} = \mathbf{G} \oplus \mathbf{F}  &lt;/math&gt;.
--&gt;
Our final assumption is that the resultant of two forces doesn't change when rotated. If &lt;math&gt; R: \mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; is any rotation (any orthogonal map for the usual vector space structure of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \det R = 1&lt;/math&gt;), then for all forces &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}, \mathbf{G}\in \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math display="block"&gt; R \left( \mathbf{F} \oplus \mathbf{G} \right) = R \left(\mathbf{F} \right) \oplus R \left(\mathbf{G} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Consider two perpendicular forces &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_1 &lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_2 &lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; being the length of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_1 \oplus \mathbf{F}_2 &lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{G}_1 := \tfrac{a^2}{x^2} \left( \mathbf{F}_1\oplus \mathbf{F}_2 \right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{G}_2 := \tfrac{a}{x} R(\mathbf{F}_2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; is the rotation between &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_1 \oplus \mathbf{F}_2 &lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G_1} = \tfrac{a}{x} R \left(\mathbf{F}_1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;. Under the invariance of the rotation, we get

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathbf{F}_1=\frac{x}{a}R^{-1} \left(\mathbf{G}_1 \right) = \frac{a}{x}R^{-1} \left(\mathbf{F}_1\oplus\mathbf{F}_2 \right)=\frac{a}{x}R^{-1} \left(\mathbf{F}_1 \right)\oplus\frac{a}{x}R^{-1} \left(\mathbf{F}_2 \right)=\mathbf{G}_1 \oplus \mathbf{G}_2  &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, consider two more forces &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H}_1 := -\mathbf{G}_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H}_2 := \tfrac{b^2}{x^2} \left( \mathbf{F}_1 \oplus \mathbf{F}_2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; be the rotation from &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_1 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H}_1 &lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H}_1 = \tfrac{b}{x} T\left(\mathbf{F}_1\right) &lt;/math&gt;, which by inspection makes &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H}_2 =\tfrac{b}{x} T\left(\mathbf{F}_2\right) &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math display="block"&gt; \mathbf{F}_2 = \frac{x}{b}T^{-1}\left(\mathbf{H}_2\right) = \frac{b}{x}T^{-1}\left(\mathbf{F}_1\oplus\mathbf{F}_2\right)=\frac{b}{x}T^{-1}\left(\mathbf{F}_1\right)\oplus\frac{b}{x}T^{-1}\left(\mathbf{F}_2\right)=\mathbf{H}_1\oplus\mathbf{H_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying these two equations

&lt;math display="block"&gt; \mathbf{F}_1\oplus \mathbf{F}_2 = \left(\mathbf{G}_1 \oplus \mathbf{G}_2 \right) \oplus \left(\mathbf{H}_1\oplus \mathbf{H_2} \right) = \left(\mathbf{G}_1 \oplus \mathbf{G}_2 \right) \oplus \left(-\mathbf{G}_2\oplus \mathbf{H}_2 \right) = \mathbf{G}_1 \oplus \mathbf{H}_2&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{G}_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{H}_2 &lt;/math&gt; both lie along &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_1 \oplus \mathbf{F}_2 &lt;/math&gt;, their lengths are equal &lt;math&gt; x= \left|\mathbf{F}_1 \oplus \mathbf{F}_2 \right| = \left|\mathbf{G}_1 \oplus \mathbf{H}_2 \right|= \tfrac{a^2}{x}+\tfrac{b^2}{x} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math display="block"&gt; x = \sqrt{a^2+b^2} &lt;/math&gt;

which implies that &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_1 \oplus \mathbf{F}_2 = a \mathbf{e}_1 \oplus b \mathbf{e}_2 &lt;/math&gt; has length &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{a^2+b^2} &lt;/math&gt;, which is the length of &lt;math&gt; a \mathbf{e}_1 + b \mathbf{e}_2 &lt;/math&gt;. Thus for the case where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_2 &lt;/math&gt; are perpendicular, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_1 \oplus \mathbf{F}_2 = \mathbf{F}_1 + \mathbf{F}_2 &lt;/math&gt;. However, when combining our two sets of auxiliary forces we used the associativity of &lt;math&gt; \oplus &lt;/math&gt;. Using this additional assumption, we will form an additional proof below.&lt;ref name="Spivak"&gt;

==Algebraic proof of the parallelogram of force==
We model forces as Euclidean vectors or members of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Our first assumption is that the resultant of two forces is in fact another force, so that for any two forces &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}, \mathbf{G} \in \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt; there is another force &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} \oplus \mathbf{G} \in \mathbb{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt;. We assume commutativity, as these are forces being applied concurrently, so the order shouldn't matter &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} \oplus \mathbf{G} = \mathbf{G} \oplus \mathbf{F}  &lt;/math&gt;.

Consider the map
&lt;math display="block&gt; (a,b) = a \mathbf{e}_1 + b \mathbf{e}_2 \mapsto a \mathbf{e}_1 \oplus b \mathbf{e}_2&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; \oplus &lt;/math&gt; is associative, then this map will be linear. Since it also sends &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_1 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_2 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_2 &lt;/math&gt;, it must also be the identity map. Thus &lt;math&gt; \oplus &lt;/math&gt; must be equivalent to the normal vector addition operator.&lt;ref name="Spivak"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The mathematical proof of the parallelogram of force is not generally accepted to be mathematically valid. Various proofs were developed (chiefly ''Duchayla's'' and ''[[Siméon Denis Poisson|Poisson's]]''), and these also caused objections. That the parallelogram of force was true was not questioned, but ''why'' it was true. Today the parallelogram of force is accepted as an empirical fact, non-reducible to Newton's first principles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5507">'''Plastic-coated paper''' is a [[coated]] or [[laminated]] [[composite material]] made of [[paper]] or [[paperboard]] with a [[plastic]] layer or treatment on a surface. This type of [[coated paper]] is most used in the [[food packaging|food]] and drink [[packaging industry]].

==Function==
The plastic is used to improve functions such as  water resistance, tear strength, abrasion resistance, ability to be [[heat seal]]ed, etc.

Some papers are laminated by heat or adhesive to a [[plastic film]] to provide barrier properties in use.   Other papers are coated with a melted plastic layer:  [[curtain coating]] is one common method.  

Printed papers commonly have a top coat of a protective polymer to seal the print, provide scuff resistance, and sometimes gloss.   Some coatings are processed by  [[UV curing]] for stability.

==Components==
Most plastic coatings in the packaging industry are [[polyethylene]] ([[LDPE]]) and to a much lesser degree [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]].
[[Shelf-stable]] cartons typically contain 74% paper, 22% plastic and 4% [[aluminum]]. [[Frozen food]] cartons are usually made up of a 80% paper and 20% plastic combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth911.com/news/recycling-mystery-milk-and-juice-cartons/|title=Recycling Mystery: Milk and Juice Cartons|publisher=earth911.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The most notable applications for plastic-coated paper are [[single use]] ([[disposable food packaging]]):&lt;ref name=ecocycle&gt;https://ecocycle.org/files/pdfs/microplastics_in_compost_presentation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[waterproof paper]] (also multi-use)

==End of life and environmental issues==
{{see also|environmental impact of paper|plastic pollution}}
Plastic coatings or layers usually make  paper recycling more difficult.  Some plastic laminations can be separated from the paper during the recycling process, allowing filtering out the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pstc.org/technical_notes/to_recycle.php?subject=packaging |title=Packaging Tapes:To Recycle of Not |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Jensen |first=Timothy |date=April 1999 |publisher=Adhesives and Sealants Council |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109204909/http://www.pstc.org/technical_notes/to_recycle.php?subject=packaging |archivedate=2007-11-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gruenewald | first = L.

[[File:Pyramidal ion 4 sided with numbers.jpg|thumb|An example of the monovalent carbocation]]

A '''pyramidal carbocation''' is a type of [[carbocation]] with a specific configuration. This ion exists as a third class, besides the classical and [[non-classical ion]]s. In these ions, a single carbon atom hovers over a four- or five-sided [[polygon]], in effect forming a [[pyramid]].  The four-sided pyramidal ion will carry a charge of 1+, and the five-sided pyramid will carry 2+. In the images (''at upper right)'', the black spot on the vertical line represents the hovering carbon atom.

The apparent coordination number of five, or even six, associated with the carbon atom at the top of the pyramid is a rarity as compared to the usual maximum of four.

== History ==
Studying these cations was sparked, at the time, by amazing results in [[computational chemistry]].  While calculating the optimal geometry of the mono-cation which arises from the extraction of chloride from 3-chlorotricyclo[2.1.0.0&lt;sup&gt;2,5&lt;/sup&gt;]pentane, the three bridges were expected to orient in space with angles of roughly 120°.  The calculations however showed the four-sided pyramid to be the most stable configuration.  At the top of this pyramid, there resides a carbon atom, still connected to a hydrogen.

== Theoretical background ==
A complete theoretical discussion will use all orbitals of all contributing atoms. A first approximation might use a [[Linear combination of atomic orbitals|LCAO]] of the [[molecular orbital]]s in the [[polygon]] forming the base of the pyramid and the orbitals on the [[Apex (geometry)#Axial (or apical) and equatorial positions|apical]] atom, as the carbon atom at the top of the pyramid.  This approximation will provide insight into the intrinsic stability of the structures.

=== Apical carbon atom ===
The [[apical (chemistry)|apical]] carbon atom is connected to only one other [[substituent]], so an sp-[[Orbital hybridization|hybridisation]] is to be expected.  The substituent will be oriented upward.  Towards the basic polygon, three orbitals are available:
* The second sp-orbital. This orbital is relatively low in energy due to the contribution of the s-orbital. With respect to the nodal planes in the remaining p-orbitals the symmetry of this orbital can be written as '''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''',&lt;ref name="SymAntiSym"&gt;'''S''' indicating the orbital is symmetric with respect to the plane indicated by the subscript.  An '''A''' describes an anti-symmetry with respect to the by the subscript indicated plane.&lt;/ref&gt; symmetric with respect to both planes.  The orbital has a rather low energy, in terms of the [[Hückel method]] its value is not easy to estimate, although it will be lower than α, since the orbital will have considerable s-character.
* Two p-orbitals.  These orbitals  have a higher energy content then the sp-orbital.  In terms of the Huckel method, the energy will be α.  In symmetry terms, these orbitals are [[orthogonal]], described as '''A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'''&lt;ref name="SymAntiSym" /&gt;

=== Base of the pyramid ===

|}
The approximation for the base of the pyramid is a closed ring of carbon atoms, all of them  sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridised.  The exact results depend on the ring size; overall conclusions can be formulated as:
* The lowest molecular orbital has, watched from the apex of the pyramid, no nodal planes. Symmetry will be '''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'''.&lt;ref name="SymAntiSym" /&gt;  In the Hückel method, its energy is {{nowrap|1=(α - 2β)}}
* The next level of energy is occupied by two degenerated orbitals. In symmetry terms, they are written as '''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''A&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'''.&lt;ref name="SymAntiSym" /&gt;  The energy depends on the size of the ring:

|-
| align="center | 3 || align="center | (α + β)

|-
| align="center | 5 || align="center | (α - 0.618β)
|-
| align="center | 6 || align="center | (α - β)
|}
* Depending on the size of the base, there will be other MOs, but they are irrelevant to the present discussion.

=== Interaction between apex and base ===
To obtain bonding interactions between atoms or parts of molecules, two conditions should be met:
* The orbitals to combine should have the same symmetry.
* A smaller difference in energy  between the combining orbitals will produce a greater stabilizing effect.
The orbitals at the apical carbon and the basic polygon are able to combine with respect to their symmetries.  The result will be a more stable configuration for the pyramids.  In figure 2, the symmetry aspects are depicted.
* The apical sp orbital combines with the lowest MO of the basic ring to a low bonding and a high anti-bonding orbital.
* The two apical p orbitals combine with the second lowest energy levels in the basic ring.  Two bonding and two anti-bonding orbitals result. Figure 3 is a graphical representation of the results.

Filling the atomic and molecular orbitals in pyramidal structures of different base size leads to the next table.  Only bonding orbitals are accounted for.

In the case of the three-sided pyramid, clearly no ion results; a known neutral species arises: [[tetrahedrane]].  To this molecule this way of description is an alternative [[Computational chemistry|quantum mechanical description]].

The other pyramidal structures will be charged in relation with their base size.

In 1972 Masamune describes the results of dissolving a number of precursors to ''4d'' (figure 4) at {{nowrap|1=- 70°C.}} in [[superacid]] (a mixture of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ClF and FSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H).  Based on both the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C as well as the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR-spectrum the evidence is clear: in each case the same intermediary is formed.  Also, when the super acidic medium is destroyed, with either [[methanol]] or [[benzoic acid]], the same product is formed.

* Assignment in the hydrogen spectrum is partly on intensity (hydrogens at the basic ring) partly on the common experience hydrogen's at the outer side of a circular conjugated system have signals at higher ppm relative to TMS, while those positioned over the ring will have lower, even negative, signals relative to TMS.
* Assignment in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR follow the same considerations as for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H.   Though in carbon NMR intensity is a bad guide to the number of atoms, in the basic ring the unsubstituted carbons are similar enough to use intensity as indication for their number.  A powerful tool too is the multiplicity of the carbon signal due to coupling with the to carbon bonded hydrogens.
* Masamune himself does not state anything about the nature of the intermediate ion.&lt;ref&gt;Although Masamune presents his practical results later the same year as Stöhrer and Hoffmann their theoretical ones, it is unlikely Masamune was able to edit his paper at the moment the implications of the theoretical work became clear.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, based on rules formulated by Olah,&lt;ref name="Olah 78a"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/gallery&gt;
As described above, independent from its synthetic route, pyramidal ion '''5a''' reacts with methanol or benzoate giving rise to products governed by reagent and the reaction medium as is clear by the substitution patterns.  In 1972 Masamune &lt;ref name="Masamune 72b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masamune 72c" /&gt; is unable to explain the different behavior of the intermediate.  In terms of the HSAB-theory an explanation might be given.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the non-substituted ion most of the charge at the hydrogen atoms.  Replacing hydrogen for carbon, the central atom of the methyl group, a more [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] substituent (2.5 versus 2.1 on the Pauling scale) will concentrate charge on the skeletal carbon.  This charge concentration has several effects:
* The reaction with benzoate is governed by π - π interactions.  The degeneration in the basic MO-system will be lost.  As the apical side is inaccessible, benzoate will approach from the bottom side of the pyramid.  The interaction between the two π-systems, both disturbed at one point, will force a specific orientation.  The orientation in which the interaction between positive charge generated by the methyl group on the pyramid and the charge adjacent to the carboxyl group will direct the system to a reaction of the carboxyl group with carbon 2 or 4 of the pyramid base.  When reaction with benzoate takes place at carbon 2 bridges will form between the apical carbon and atoms 1 and 3.  A bond too will form between ''anti''-carbon 4 and the apex.  Reaction at carbon 4 will have a same effect, although the resulting molecule has a mirror relation with respect to the molecule that results from reaction at position 2.
* The reaction with methanol is charge driven.  In de basic system an identifiable center of positive charge is present at the carbon carrying the methyl group.  Methanol with its [[HSAB theory|hard base]] in oxygen, will react at the center of positivity.  The methoxy group appears at carbon 1, forcing bridges to form between carbon 2 and 4 to the apex, as well as between the now ''anti''-carbon 3.

==== Bishomomonocarbocation ====
In chemistry, the prefix "homo-" denotes a [[Homologous series|homolog]], a likewise compound containing one, or as in this case two, extra CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-groups.  The common aspect of the bishomo ions is the possession of a [[1,4-cyclohexadiene]] ring instead of a [[cyclobutadiene]] one.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The stability of this ion at first may seem strange, as enlargement of the ring in general will diminish the bonding overlap between the orbitals at the center of the pyramidal structure.  Here the sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridization, and consequently the planarity of the atoms of and those directly bonded to the sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; centers, forces the tops of the p-orbitals of the basal carbons towards each other, thus creating a solid base for the apical carbon to sit on.  Stiffening the configuration by a bridge between the homo-atoms, converting the base of the pyramid, to a [[norbornadiene]], creates an even more stable structure.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the monocation, which is described with several patterns of substitution, the dication is mainly studied by its hexamethyl derivative.  The synthesis starts at [[hexamethyl Dewar benzene]] (compound '''I''' in table 4) reacting with [[Chlorine|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]  into 5,6-dichloro-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexamethylbicyclo[2.1.1]hex-2-ene (compound '''II''' in table 4).

The assignment of the signals is based on their intensities and multiplicities.  The assignment of the pyramidal structure is based on the observed simplicity of the spectra: five equal C-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups combined with one outstanding C-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group.  The only way to construct a molecular entity from this data is a five-sided pyramid.  Rapid equilibriums between degenerated classical or non-classical carbocations are discarded as the position of the signals does not match the expected values for those kind of structures.&lt;ref name="Hogeveen 1974a" /&gt;

The reactions of the dication fall apart into three groups:&lt;ref name="Hogeveen 1974b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogeveen 1973a" /&gt;
* '''Thermal reactions'''  The hexamethyl substituted dication is a stable structure up to {{cvt|40|°C}}.  Above this temperature reaction occurs: a [[hydride]]-ion is taken up, followed by an irreversible rearrangement to a [[Meisenheimer complex]] which is stable in the fluorosulfonic acid medium (see: Figure&amp;nbsp;6, upper reaction).  
* '''Charged nucleophiles''' (hydride, methoxide, hydroxide) react reversible, leading to, independent of the nucleofile at hand, identical 2,4-substituted tricyclo[3.1.0.0&lt;sup&gt;3,6&lt;/sup&gt;]hexane derivatis, e.g.: with methoxide: 2,4-dimethoxy-tricyclo[3.1.0.0&lt;sup&gt;3,6&lt;/sup&gt;]hexane is formed (see: Figure&amp;nbsp;6, middle reaction path).
* Uncharged nucleofiles ([[amine]]s like  [[triethylamine]]) act as a base, reversible extracting two hydrogens from the ion, in effect producing a dimethylene derivative of [[benzvalene]] (see: Figure&amp;nbsp;6, lower reaction).

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One or both double bonds are oxidized to a keton.  The keton then is reacted with an [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic compound]] producing an alkylated hydroxide.  The compounds formed in this way possess one or two other alkyl groups, depending on the number of oxidized double bonds.  When the [[alcohol]]s are dissolved in [[fluorosulfonic acid]], they again give rise to new pyramidal dications.  Both non-methyl groups occupy basal positions.  Each other position at the pyramidal skeleton still carries a methyl group.  Table&amp;nbsp;6 summarizes these findings.

Up to this point the substitution pattern of the divalent pyramidal ion is of minor importance to its behavior.  A clear difference arises when the thermal stability if the ions of type '''V''' (Table 6) is studied: {{nowrap|1=at {{cvt|-40|°C}}}} the apical ethyl substituted ion is stable for 48 hours, whereas no trace of the apical ''iso''-propyl ion is detectable anymore.

=== Tervalent and higher ions ===
At the time of the literature survey (end of 1978), there were no reports on tervalent or higher pyramidal cations.

A '''quantum critical point''' is a point in the phase diagram of a material where a continuous [[phase transition]] takes place at [[absolute zero]]. A quantum critical point is typically achieved by a continuous suppression of a nonzero temperature phase transition to zero temperature by the application of a pressure, field, or through doping.
Conventional phase transitions occur at nonzero temperature when the growth of random [[thermal fluctuations]] leads to a
change in the physical state of a system. [[Condensed matter physics]] research over the past few decades has revealed a new class of phase transitions called [[quantum phase transition|quantum phase transitions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quantum Phase Transitions by Subir Sachdev|last=Sachdev|first=Subir|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511622540|year = 2000|isbn = 9780511622540|citeseerx = 10.1.1.673.6555}}&lt;/ref&gt; which take place at [[absolute zero]]. In the absence of the thermal fluctuations which trigger conventional phase transitions, quantum phase transitions are
driven by the zero point quantum fluctuations associated with Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]].

==Overview==
Within the class of phase transitions, there are two main categories: at a [[first-order phase transition]],  the properties shift discontinuously, as in the melting of solid,  whereas at a [[second order phase transition]],  the state of the system changes in a continuous fashion.  Second-order phase transitions are marked by the growth of fluctuations on ever-longer length-scales.  These fluctuations are called "critical fluctuations". At the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] where a second-order transition occurs the critical fluctuations are [[scale invariant]] and extend over the entire system. At a nonzero temperature phase transition, the fluctuations that develop at a critical point are governed by classical physics, because the characteristic energy of quantum fluctuations is always smaller than the characteristic Boltzmann thermal energy &lt;math&gt;k_B T&lt;/math&gt;.

At a quantum critical point, the critical fluctuations are quantum mechanical in nature, exhibiting scale invariance in both space and in time. Unlike classical critical points, where the critical fluctuations are limited to a narrow region around the phase transition, the influence of a quantum critical point is felt over a wide range of temperatures above the quantum critical point, so the effect of quantum criticality is felt without ever reaching absolute zero.  Quantum criticality was first observed in [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectrics]], in which the ferroelectric transition temperature is suppressed to zero.

A wide variety of metallic [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]] and [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnets]] have been observed to develop quantum critical behavior when their magnetic transition temperature is driven to zero through the application of pressure, chemical doping or magnetic fields. In these cases, the properties of the metal are radically transformed by the critical fluctuations, departing qualitatively from the standard [[Fermi liquid]] behavior, to  form a metallic state sometimes called a [[Fermi liquid theory#Non-Fermi liquids|non-Fermi liquid]] or a "strange metal". There is particular interest in these unusual metallic states, which are believed to exhibit a marked preponderance towards the development of [[superconductivity]]. Quantum critical fluctuations have also been shown to drive the formation of exotic magnetic phases in the vicinity of quantum critical points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conduit|first=G.

==Quantum critical endpoints==
Quantum critical points arise when a susceptibility diverges at zero temperature. There are a number of materials (such as CeNi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Non-Fermi-Liquid Effects at Ambient Pressure in a Stoichiometric Heavy-Fermion Compound with Very Low Disorder: CeNi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, P. Gegenwart, F. Kromer, M. Lang, G. Sparn, C. Geibel and F. Steglich. Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, #6, 1293-1296 (1999).[http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v82/p1293 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;) where this occurs serendipitously. More frequently a material has to be tuned to a quantum critical point. Most commonly this is done by taking a system with a second-order phase transition which occurs at nonzero temperature and tuning it—for example by applying pressure or magnetic field or changing its chemical composition. CePd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is such an example,&lt;ref&gt;The normal states of magnetic d and f transition metals,  S R Julian, C Pfleiderer, F M Grosche, N D Mathur, G J McMullan, A J Diver, I R Walker and G G Lon zarich, J.

Mathur |author2=F.M. Grosche |author3=S.R. Julian |author4=I.R. Walker |author5=D.M. Freye |author6=R.K.W. Haselwimmer |author7=G.G. Lonzarich |year=1998|title=Magnetically mediated superconductivity in heavy fermion compounds|journal=Nature|volume=394|issue=6688 |pages=39–43|doi=10.1038/27838|bibcode = 1998Natur.394...39M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Less commonly a first-order transition can be made quantum critical. First-order transitions do not normally show critical fluctuations as the material moves discontinuously from one phase into another. However, if the first order phase transition does not involve a change of symmetry then the phase diagram can contain a critical endpoint where the first-order phase transition terminates. Such an endpoint has a divergent susceptibility. The transition between the liquid and gas phases is an example of a first-order transition without a change of symmetry and the critical endpoint is characterized by critical fluctuations known as [[critical opalescence]].

A quantum critical endpoint arises when a nonzero temperature critical point is tuned to zero temperature. One of the best studied examples occurs in the layered ruthenate metal, Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; in a magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;Magnetic Field-Tuned Quantum Criticality in the Metallic Ruthenate Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ru&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, S. A. Grigera, R. S. Perry, A. J. Schofield, M. Chiao, S. R. Julian, G. G. Lonzarich, S. I. Ikeda, Y. Maeno, A. J. Millis, A. P. Mackenzie, Science 294, #5541, 329-332 (2001). [http://sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/294/5541/329 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; This material shows [[metamagnetism]] with a low-temperature first-order metamagnetic transition where the magnetization jumps when a magnetic field is applied within the directions of the layers. The first-order jump terminates in a critical endpoint at about 1 kelvin. By switching the direction of the magnetic field so that it points almost perpendicular to the layers, the critical endpoint is tuned to zero temperature at a field of about 8 teslas. The resulting quantum critical fluctuations dominate the physical properties of this material at nonzero temperatures and away from the critical field. The resistivity shows a non-Fermi liquid response, the [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] of the electron grows and the [[magnetostriction|magnetothermal expansion]] of the material is modified all in response to the quantum critical fluctuations.

==Non-equilibrium quantum phase transition==
An intuitive guess of the effect of a quantum critical point being affected by noise would be that the external noise defines an [[effective temperature]]. This effective temperature would introduce a well defined energy scale in the problem and break the scale invariance of the quantum critical point. On the contrary, it was recently found that certain types of noise can induce a non-equilibrium quantum critical state. This state is out-of-equilibrium because of the continuous energy flow introduced by the noise, but it still retains the scale invariant behavior typical of critical points.

'''Rice paper''' is a product made of paper-like materials from East Asia made from different plants. These include:
*''Thin peeled dried pith of [[Tetrapanax papyrifer]]'': A sheet-like "paper" material was used extensively in late 19th century [[Guangdong]] China as a common support medium for [[gouache]] paintings sold to Western clients of the era. The term was first defined in the Chinese-English Dictionary of [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]] who referred to the use of the Chinese medicinal plant as material for painting, as well as for making [[artificial flowers]] and [[Sole (shoe)|shoe soles]].&lt;ref name=TP/&gt;
*''[[Xuan paper]] made from [[paper mulberry]]'': The traditional paper which originated in ancient China and it has been used for centuries in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam for writing, artwork, and architecture.
*''Various pulp-based papers'': May be made from the rice straw&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=rice paper|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/rice-paper|publisher=Answers Corporation|accessdate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other plants, such as [[hemp]] and bamboo.
*''Dried [[starch]] sheets of various thickness or texture'': These ''edible paper'' sheets have some properties of pulp paper and can be made from [[rice]] starch. They are known as [[banh trang]], used in [[Vietnamese cuisine]].

==Rice paper plant==
In [[Europe]], around the 1900s, a paperlike substance was originally known as '''rice paper''', due to the mistaken notion that it is made from rice. In fact, it consists of the [[pith]] of a small tree, ''[[Tetrapanax papyrifer]]'', the ''rice paper plant'' (蓪草).&lt;ref name=TP&gt;{{citation |journal=探索·发现 |year=2011 |number=139 |title=通草奇画 |url=http://kejiao.cntv.cn/history/tansuofaxian/classpage/video/20110519/101220.shtml |publisher=CCTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant grows in the swampy forests of [[Taiwan]], and is also [[Horticulture|cultivated]] as an [[ornamental plant]] for its large, exotic leaves.&lt;ref&gt;George W. Staples and Derral R. Herbst. 2005. "A Tropical Garden Flora". Bishop Museum Press: Honolulu, HI, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to produce the paper, the boughs are boiled and freed from bark. The cylindrical core of pith is rolled on a hard flat surface against a knife, by which it is cut into thin sheets of a fine ivory-like texture.

Dyed in various colours, this rice paper is extensively used for the preparation of artificial flowers, while the white sheets are employed for [[watercolor]] drawings. Due to its texture, this paper is not suited for writing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Mulberry paper==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
[[File:Neko-chigura.jpg|thumb|right|[[Neko chigura]], a kind of cat house made of [[rice straw]].]]
This "rice paper", smooth, thin, crackly, and strong, is named as a wrapper for rice, and is made from bark fibres of the [[paper mulberry]] tree. It is used for [[origami]], [[calligraphy]], paper screens and clothing. It is stronger than commercially made wood-pulp paper. Less commonly, the paper is made from [[rice straw]].

Depending on the type of mulberry used, it is named kozo (''Broussonetia papyrifera'', the [[paper mulberry]]), gampi (''Wikstroemia diplomorpha''), or mitsumata (''Edgeworthia chrysantha''). The fiber comes from the bark of the paper mulberry, not the inner wood or pith, and traditionally the paper is made by hand.

The branches of the paper mulberry shrubs are harvested in the autumn, so the fibre can be processed and the paper formed during the cold winter months, because the fibre spoils easily in the heat. The branches are cut into sections two to three feet long and steamed in a large kettle, which makes the bark shrink back from the inner wood, allowing it to be pulled off like a banana peel. The bark can then be dried and stored, or used immediately. There are three layers to the bark at this stage: black bark, the outermost layer; green bark, the middle layer; and white bark, the innermost layer. All three can be made into paper, but the finest paper is made of white bark only.

If the bark strips have been dried, they are soaked in water overnight before being processed further. To clean the black and green bark from the white bark, the bark strip is spread on a board and scraped with a flat knife. Any knots or tough spots in the fibre are cut out and discarded at this stage.

The scraped bark strips are then cooked for two or three hours in a mixture of water and [[soda ash]]. The fibre is cooked enough when it can easily be pulled apart lengthwise. The strips are then rinsed several times in clean water to rinse off the soda ash. Rinsing also makes the fibre brighter and whiter—fine kozo paper is not [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleach]]ed, but is naturally pure white.

Each bark strip is then inspected by hand, against a white background or lit from behind by a light box. Any tiny pieces of black bark and other debris are removed with tweezers, and any knots or tough patches of fibre missed during scraping are cut out of the strips. The ultimate goal is to have completely pure white bark.

The scraped, cooked, and cleaned strips are then laid out on a table and beaten by hand. The beating tool is a wooden bat that looks like a thicker version of a [[cricket bat]]. The fibres are beaten for about half an hour, or until all the fibres have been separated and no longer resemble strips of bark.

The prepared fibre can now be made into sheets of paper. A viscous substance called formation aid is added to the vat with the fibre and water. Formation aid is polyethylene oxide, and it helps slow the flow of water, which gives the paper-maker more time to form sheets. Sheets are formed with multiple thin layers of fibre, one on top of another.

==Vietnamese rice paper==
[[Image:Rice paper.jpg|thumb|Rice paper]]
Edible rice paper is used for making fresh [[summer roll]]s ([[salad roll]]s) or fried spring rolls in [[Vietnamese cuisine]], where the rice paper is called [[bánh tráng]] or [[bánh đa nem]]. Ingredients of the food rice paper include white [[rice flour]], [[tapioca flour]], salt, and water. The tapioca powder makes the rice paper glutinous and smooth. It is usually sold dried in thin, crisp, translucent round sheets that are wrapped in cellophane. The sheets are dipped briefly in hot water to soften them, then wrapped around savoury or sweet ingredients.

Edible paper is used in the home baking of foods such as [[macaroons]] and is often sold separately as colored sheets that are either plain or printed with images, such as bank notes and dollar bills.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frankiescandybar.com/candy/novelty/funny-money-edible-paper/&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
In the pilot episode of the television series ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', [[Kwai Chang Caine]] undergoes training to become a Shaolin priest. One of the challenges he faces is to walk on a long sheet of rice paper without tearing it or leaving any marks of his passage. His successful completion of the test is incorporated into the series' opening title sequence, with the narration, "When you can walk its length and leave no trace, you will have learned."

'''Stone carving''' is an activity where pieces of rough natural [[Rock (geology)|stone]] are shaped by the controlled removal of stone. Owing to the permanence of the material, stone work has survived which was created during our [[prehistory]].

Work carried out by [[paleolithic]] societies to create [[flint tool]]s is more often referred to as [[knapping]]. Stone carving that is done to produce lettering is more often referred to as [[lettering]]. The process of removing stone from the earth is called [[mining]] or [[quarrying]].

Stone carving is one of the processes which may be used by an [[artist]] when creating a [[sculpture]]. The term also refers to the activity of [[stonemason|masons]] in dressing stone blocks for use in [[architecture]], [[building]] or [[civil engineering]]. It is also a phrase used by [[archaeologist]]s, [[historians]], and [[anthropologists]] to describe the activity involved in making some types of [[petroglyph]]s.

==History==
The earliest known works of representational art are stone carvings. Often marks carved into rock or [[petroglyphs]] will survive where painted work will not. Prehistoric [[Venus figurines]] such as the [[Venus of Berekhat Ram]] may be as old as 800,000 years{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}, and are carved in stones such as [[tuff]] and [[limestone]].

These earliest examples of the stone carving are the result of hitting or scratching a softer stone with a harder one, although sometimes more resilient materials such as antlers are known to have been used for relatively soft stone. Another early technique was to use an abrasive that was rubbed on the stone to remove the unwanted area.
Prior to the discovery of [[steel]] by any culture, all stone carving was carried out by using an [[Wear#Abrasive wear|abrasion]] technique, following rough hewing of the stone block using hammers. The reason for this is that [[bronze]], the hardest available metal until steel, is not [[Hardness|hard]] enough to work any but the softest stone. The Ancient Greeks used the [[ductile|ductility]] of bronze to trap small granules of [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]], that are naturally occurring on the island of [[Milos]], thus making a very efficient [[File (tool)|file]] for abrading the stone.

The development of [[iron]] made possible stone carving tools, such as chisels, drills and saws made from [[steel]], that were capable of being [[Hardness|hardened]] and [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempered]] to a state hard enough to cut stone without deforming, while not being so brittle as to shatter. Carving tools have changed little since then.

Modern, industrial, large quantity techniques still rely heavily on abrasion to cut and remove stone, although at a significantly faster rate with processes such as [[water jet cutter|water erosion]] and [[diamond saw]] cutting.

One modern stone carving technique uses a new process: The technique of applying sudden high temperature to the surface. The expansion of the top surface due to the sudden increase in temperature causes it to break away. On a small scale, [[Oxyacetylene|Oxy-acetylene]] torches are used. On an industrial scale, [[laser]]s are used. On a massive scale, carvings such as the [[Crazy Horse Memorial]] carved from the Harney Peak granite of [[Mount Rushmore]] and the [[Confederate Memorial Park (Albany, Georgia)|Confederate Memorial Park]] in Albany, Georgia are produced using [[Jet (fluid)|jet]] heat torches.

==Stone sculpture==

Carving stone into [[sculpture]] is an activity older than civilization itself.  [[Prehistoric]] sculptures were usually human forms, such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]] and the faceless statues of the [[Cycladic]] cultures of ancient Greece. Later cultures devised animal, human-animal and abstract forms in stone.  The earliest cultures used abrasive techniques, and modern technology employs pneumatic hammers and other devices. But for most of human history, sculptors used hammer and chisel as the basic tools for carving stone.

The process begins with the selection of a stone for carving.  Some artists use the stone itself as inspiration; the [[Renaissance]] artist [[Michelangelo]] claimed that his job was to free the human form trapped inside the block.  Other artists begin with a form already in mind and find a stone to complement their vision.  The sculptor may begin by forming a model in clay or wax, sketching the form of the statue on paper or drawing a general outline of the statue on the stone itself.

When ready to carve, the artist usually begins by knocking off large portions of unwanted stone. This is the "roughing out" stage of the sculpting process.  For this task they may select a point [[chisel]], which is a long, hefty piece of steel with a point at one end and a broad striking surface at the other.  A pitching tool may also be used at this early stage; which is a wedge-shaped chisel with a broad, flat edge. The pitching tool is useful for splitting the stone and removing large, unwanted chunks.  Those two chisels are used in combination with a [[lump hammer|masons driving hammer]].

Once the general shape of the statue has been determined, the sculptor uses other tools to refine the figure. A toothed chisel or claw chisel has multiple gouging surfaces which create parallel lines in the stone.  These tools are generally used to add texture to the figure.  An artist might mark out specific lines by using calipers to measure an area of stone to be addressed, and marking the removal area with pencil, charcoal or chalk. The stone carver generally uses a shallower stroke at this point in the process, usually in combination with a wooden [[mallet]].

Eventually the sculptor has changed the stone from a rough block into the general shape of the finished statue. Tools called [[rasp]]s and [[riffler]]s are then used to enhance the shape into its final form. A rasp is a flat, steel tool with a coarse surface. The sculptor uses broad, sweeping strokes to remove excess stone as small chips or dust. A riffler is a smaller variation of the rasp, which can be used to create details such as folds of clothing or locks of hair.

The final stage of the carving process is polishing.  Sandpaper can be used as a first step in the polishing process, or sand cloth.  Emery, a stone that is harder and rougher than the sculpture media, is also used in the finishing process. This abrading, or wearing away, brings out the color of the stone, reveals patterns in the surface and adds a sheen.  Tin and iron oxides are often used to give the stone a highly reflective exterior.

Sculptures can be carved via either the direct or the indirect carving method. Indirect carving is a way of carving by using an accurate clay, wax or plaster model, which is then copied with the use of a [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] or ''proportional dividers''&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Malvina, ''Sculpture Inside and Out'', Bonanza Books, New York,  1939  p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[pointing machine]]. The direct carving method is a way of carving in a more intuitive  way, without first making an elaborate model. Sometimes a sketch on paper or a rough clay draft is made.

==Stone carving considerations==
[[File:Arabic style ashlar.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;'Arabic' style carving on ashlar building blocks, [[Beith]], Scotland]]

Stone has been used for carving since ancient times for many reasons. Most types of stone are easier to find than metal ores, which have to be mined and smelted. Stone can be dug from the surface and carved with hand tools. Stone is more durable than wood, and carvings in stone last much longer than wooden artifacts. Stone comes in many varieties and artists have abundant choices in color, quality and relative hardness.

Soft stone such as [[chalk]], [[soapstone]], [[pumice]] and [[Tufa]] can be easily carved with found items such as harder stone or in the case of chalk even the fingernail.
[[Limestone]]s and [[marble]]s can be worked using abrasives and simple iron tools.
[[Granite]], [[basalt]] and some [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] stone is difficult to carve even with iron or steel tools; usually [[tungsten carbide]] tipped tools are used, although abrasives still work well. Modern techniques often use abrasives attached to machine tools to cut the stone.

Precious and semi-precious [[gemstone]]s are also carved into delicate shapes for jewellery or larger items, and polished; this is sometimes referred to as [[lapidary]], although strictly speaking lapidary refers to cutting and polishing alone.

When worked, some stones release dust that can damage lungs (silica crystals are usually to blame), so a respirator is sometimes needed.

==Stone shaping and tools==
Basic stone carving tools fall into five categories:

* Percussion tools for hitting - such as mallets, axes, adzes, bouchards and toothed hammers.
* Tools for rough shaping of stone, to form a block the size needed for the carving. These include feathers and wedges and pitching tools. 
* [[Chisel]]s for cutting - such as lettering chisels, points, pitching tools, and claw chisels. Chisels in turn may be hand held and hammered or pneumatic powered.
* [[Diamond tool]]s which include burrs, cup wheels, and blades mounted on a host of power tools.These are used sometimes through the entire carving process from rough work to final finish.
* [[Abrasive]]s for material removal - such as [[carborundum]] blocks, drills, saws, grinding and cutting wheels, water-abrasive machinery and dressing tools such as French and English drags.

More advanced processes, such as [[laser cutting]] and [[jet torch]]es, use sudden high temperature with a combination of cooling water to spall flakes of stone. Other modern processes may involve [[diamond-wire]] machines or other large scale production equipment to remove large sections of undesired stone.

The use of chisels for '''stone carving''' is possible in several ways. Two are:

*The masons stroke, in which a flat chisel is used at approximately 90 degrees to the surface in an organized sweep. It shatters the stone beneath it and each successive pass lowers the surface.
*The lettering stroke, in which the chisel is used along the surface at approximately 30 degrees to cut beneath the existing surface.

There are many types and styles of stone carving tools, each carver will decide for themselves which tools to use. Traditionalists might use hand tools only. 
* Lettering chisels for incising small strokes create the details of letters in larger applications.
* Fishtail carving chisels are used to create pockets, valleys and for intricate carving, whilst providing good visibility around the stone.
* Masonry chisels are used for the general shaping of stones.
* Stone point tools are used to rough out the surface of the stone.
* Stone claw tools are used to remove the peaks and troughs left from the previously used tools.
* Stone pitching tools are used to remove large quantities of stone.
* Stone nickers are used to split stones by tracing a line along the stone with progressive strikes until the stone breaks along the line.

Powered [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] hammers make the hard work easier. Progress on shaping stone is faster with pneumatic carving tools. [[Air hammer (fabrication)|Air hammer]]s (such as Cuturi) place many thousands of impacts per minute upon the end of the tool, which would usually be manufactured or modified to suit the purpose. This type of tool creates the ability to 'shave' the stone, providing a smooth and consistent stroke, allowing for larger surfaces to be worked.

Among modern tool types, there are two main stone carving chisels:
* Heat treated high [[carbon steel]] tools - Generally forged
* [[Tungsten carbide]] tipped tools - Generally forged, slotted, and carbide inserts brazed in to provide a harder and longer-wearing cutting edge.

'''Strontium fluoride''', '''SrF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', also called '''strontium difluoride''' and '''strontium(II) fluoride''', is a [[fluoride]] of [[strontium]]. It is a stable brittle white crystalline solid with melting point of 1477&amp;nbsp;°C and boiling point 2460&amp;nbsp;°C.  It appears as the mineral [[strontiofluorite]].

==Preparation==
Strontium fluoride is prepared by reaction of [[strontium chloride]] with [[fluorine]] gas, or by action of [[hydrofluoric acid]] on [[strontium carbonate]].

==Structure==
The solid adopts the [[calcium fluoride|fluorite]] structure. In the vapour phase the SrF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule is non-linear with an F−Sr−F angle  of approximately  120°.&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an exception to [[VSEPR theory]] which would predict a linear structure. Ab initio calculations have been cited to propose that contributions from d orbitals in the shell below the valence shell are responsible.&lt;ref&gt;Ab initio model potential study of the equilibrium geometry of alkaline earth dihalides: MX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba; X=F, Cl, Br, I)Seijo L.,Barandiarán Z J. Chem. Phys. 94, 3762 (1991) {{doi|10.1063/1.459748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another proposal is that polarization of the electron core of the strontium atom creates an approximately tetrahedral distribution of charge that interacts with  the Sr−F bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Core Distortions and Geometries of the Difluorides and Dihydrides of Ca, Sr, and Ba Bytheway I, Gillespie RJ, Tang TH, Bader RF Inorganic Chemistry, Vol.34, No.9, 2407-2414, 1995 {{doi|10.1021/ic00113a023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
It is almost insoluble in water (its [[Solubility product|K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;]] value is approximately 2.0x10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; at 25 [[Celsius|degrees Celsius]]).

It irritates eyes and skin, and is harmful when inhaled or ingested.&lt;br /&gt;
Similar to CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and BaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SrF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; displays [[superionic conductivity]] at elevated temperatures.&lt;ref name="http://www.newmet.co.uk/Products/koch/strontium.php"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051214052733/http://www.newmet.co.uk/Products/koch/strontium.php https://web.archive.org/web/20051214052733/http://www.newmet.co.uk/Products/koch/strontium.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

Strontium fluoride is transparent to light in the wavelengths from [[vacuum ultraviolet]] (150&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]]) to [[infrared]] (11&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]]). Its optical properties are intermediate to [[calcium fluoride]] and [[barium fluoride]].&lt;ref name="http://www.crystran.co.uk/strontium-fluoride-srf2.htm"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mediatopia Ltd |url=http://www.crystran.co.uk/strontium-fluoride-srf2.htm |title=http://www.crystran.co.uk/strontium-fluoride-srf2.htm |publisher=Crystran.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Strontium fluoride is used as an [[optical material]] for a small range of special applications, for example, as an [[optical coating]] on lenses and also as a [[thermoluminescence|thermoluminescent]] [[dosimeter]] crystal.

Another use is as a carrier of [[strontium-90]] [[radioisotope]] in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1130">In chemistry, a '''sulfoselenide''' is a compound containing both [[metal sulfide]]s and metal [[selenide]]s.   Because metal sulfides and metal selenides have similar crystal structures, they exhibit some mutual solubility, forming solid solutions. Since the [[ionic radius]] sulfide of (S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) is however much smaller than that for selenide (Se&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), the solubility ranges can be only limited.  For example, pyrite (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) will accept only a few percent of selenium in place of sulfur.    A broader range is seen for the [[solid solution]] of cadmium sulfide and cadmium selenide.  CdS is yellow and CdSe is red.  The sulfoselenides of cadmium are orange.  They are used as an artist's pigment.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Hugo Müller, Wolfgang Müller, Manfred Wehner, Heike Liewald "Artists' Colors" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a03_143.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The salts [[caesium superoxide|CsO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[rubidium superoxide|RbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[potassium superoxide|KO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[sodium superoxide|NaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] are prepared by the reaction of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the respective alkali metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holleman|first1=A.F.|title=Inorganic chemistry|date=2001|publisher=Academic Press, W. de Gruyter.|location=San Diego, Calif. : Berlin|isbn=0-12-352651-5|edition=1st English ed., [edited] by Nils Wiberg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The_Preparation_of_Calcium_Superoxide_from_Calcium_Peroxide_Diperoxyhydrate|first1=E.|last1=Vernon Ballou|first2=Peter|last2=C.

The alkali salts of {{chem|O|2|-}} are orange-yellow in color and quite stable, provided they are kept dry. Upon dissolution of these salts in water, however, the dissolved {{chem|O|2|-}} undergoes [[disproportionation]] (dismutation) extremely rapidly (in a pH-dependent manner):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cotton&amp;Wilkinson5th|page=461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:4 {{chem|O|2|-}}  + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

This reaction (with moisture and carbon dioxide in exhaled air) is the basis of the use of potassium superoxide as an oxygen source in [[chemical oxygen generator]]s, such as those used on the [[space shuttle]] and on [[submarine]]s. Superoxides are also used in [[firefighter]]s' [[oxygen tank]]s in order to provide a readily available source of oxygen.

In this process {{chem|O|2|-}} acts as a [[acid-base reaction theories|Brønsted base]], initially forming the radical [[hydroperoxyl|HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·]]. But the [[pKa|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of its [[conjugate acid]], [[hydrogen superoxide]] (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·, also known as "[[hydroperoxyl]]" or "perhydroxy radical"), is 4.88 so that at neutral [[pH]]&amp;nbsp;7 all but 0.3% of superoxide is in the anionic form, {{chem|O|2|-}}.

Potassium superoxide is soluble in [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] (facilitated by crown ethers) and is stable as long as protons are not available. Superoxide can also be generated in [[aprotic]] solvents by [[cyclic voltammetry]].

Salts also decompose in the solid state, but this process requires heating:

:2 NaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Biology==
Superoxide and hydroperoxyl (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are discussed interchangeably, although superoxide predominates at physiological pHs.  Both superoxide and hydroperoxyl are classified as [[reactive oxygen species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Valko, M., Leibfritz, D., Moncol, J., Cronin, MTD., Mazur, M., Telser, J. |journal=International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology |title=Free radicals and antioxidants in normal physiological functions and human disease |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=44–84 |date=August 2007 |pmid=16978905 |doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2006.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generated by the [[immune system]] to kill invading [[microorganism]]s. In [[phagocyte]]s, superoxide is produced in large quantities by the [[enzyme]] [[NADPH oxidase]] for use in oxygen-dependent killing mechanisms of invading pathogens. Mutations in the gene coding for the NADPH oxidase cause an immunodeficiency syndrome called [[chronic granulomatous disease]], characterized by extreme susceptibility to infection, especially catalase-positive organisms. In turn, micro-organisms genetically engineered to lack [[superoxide dismutase]] (SOD) lose [[virulence]]. Superoxide is also deleterious when produced as a byproduct of [[mitochondria]]l [[cellular respiration|respiration]] (most notably by [[Complex I]] and [[Complex III]]), as well as several other enzymes, for example [[xanthine oxidase]].&lt;ref name="pmid17640558"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Muller, F. L., Lustgarten, M. S., Jang, Y., Richardson, A. and Van Remmen, H. | title = Trends in oxidative aging theories. | journal = Free Radic. Biol. Med. | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 477–503 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17640558 | doi =10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2007.03.034  | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because superoxide is toxic at high concentrations, nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen contain superoxide-scavenging enzymes called [[superoxide dismutase]] (SOD). SOD efficiently catalyzes the [[disproportionation]] of superoxide:
:2 HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Other proteins that can be both oxidized and reduced by superoxide (e.g., [[Hemoglobin#Iron.27s oxidation state in oxyhemoglobin|hemoglobin]]) have weak SOD-like activity. Genetic inactivation ("[[Gene knockout|knockout]]") of SOD produces deleterious [[phenotype]]s in organisms ranging from bacteria to mice and have provided important clues as to the mechanisms of toxicity of superoxide in vivo.

[[Yeast#Science|Yeast]] lacking both mitochondrial and cytosolic SOD grow very poorly in air, but quite well under anaerobic conditions. Absence of cytosolic SOD causes a dramatic increase in mutagenesis and genomic instability. Mice lacking mitochondrial SOD (MnSOD) die around 21 days after birth due to neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathy, and lactic acidosis.&lt;ref name="pmid17640558"/&gt; Mice lacking cytosolic SOD (CuZnSOD) are viable but suffer from multiple pathologies, including reduced lifespan, [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]], [[muscle atrophy]], [[cataracts]], thymic involution, haemolytic anemia and a very rapid age-dependent decline in female fertility.&lt;ref name="pmid17640558"/&gt;

Superoxide may contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases (the evidence is particularly strong for [[radiation]] poisoning and [[hyperoxia|hyperoxic]] injury), and perhaps also to [[aging]] via the oxidative damage that it inflicts on cells. While the action of superoxide in the pathogenesis of some conditions is strong (for instance, mice and rats overexpressing CuZnSOD or MnSOD are more resistant to strokes and heart attacks), the role of superoxide in aging must be regarded as unproven for now. In [[model organism]]s (yeast, the fruit fly Drosophila and mice), genetically [[Gene knockout|knocking out]] CuZnSOD shortens lifespan and accelerates certain features of aging ([[cataracts]], [[muscle atrophy]], [[macular degeneration]], [[thymic involution]]).  But the converse, increasing the levels of CuZnSOD, does not seem (except perhaps in ''[[Drosophila]]''), to consistently increase lifespan.&lt;ref name="pmid17640558"/&gt; The most widely accepted view is that oxidative damage (resulting from multiple causes, including superoxide) is but one of several factors limiting lifespan.

The binding of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by heme proteins involves formation of Fe(III) superoxide complex.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assay in biological systems===
The assay of superoxide generated in biological systems is a difficult task because of its high reactivity and short half-life.&lt;ref name="pmid8074285"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Rapoport | first1 = R. | last2 = Hanukoglu | first2 = I. | last3 = Sklan | first3 = D. | title = A fluorimetric assay for hydrogen peroxide, suitable for NAD(P)H-dependent superoxide generating redox systems. | journal = Anal Biochem | volume = 218 | issue = 2 | pages = 309–13 |date=May 1994 | doi = 10.1006/abio.1994.1183 | PMID = 8074285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One approach that has been used in quantitative assays converts superoxide to [[hydrogen peroxide]], which is relatively stable. Hydrogen peroxide is then assayed by a fluorimetric method.&lt;ref name="pmid8074285" /&gt; As a free radical, superoxide has a strong [[Electron paramagnetic resonance|EPR]] signal, and it is possible to detect superoxide directly using this method when its abundance is high enough. For practical purposes, this can be achieved only in vitro under non-physiological conditions, such as high pH (which slows the spontaneous dismutation) with the enzyme [[xanthine oxidase]]. Researchers have developed a series of tool compounds termed "[[spin trap]]s"(see [[spin trapping]]) that can react with superoxide, forming a meta-stable radical (half-life 1–15 minutes), which can be more readily detected by EPR. Superoxide spin trapping was initially carried out with [[DMPO]], but, more recently, phosphorus derivatives with improved half-lives, such as [[DEPPMPO]] and [[DIPPMPO]], have become more widely used.

==Bonding and structure==
Superoxides are compounds in which the [[oxidation number]] of oxygen is −{{frac|2}}. Whereas molecular oxygen (dioxygen) is a [[diradical]] containing two [[unpaired electron]]s, the addition of a second electron fills one of its two [[Degenerate energy level|degenerate]] [[molecular orbital]]s, leaving a charged ionic species with single unpaired electron and a net negative charge of −1.  Both dioxygen and the superoxide anion are [[free radicals]] that exhibit [[paramagnetism]].  

The derivatives of dioxygen have characteristic O–O distances that correlate with the [[bond order|order]] of the O–O bond.

'''TACA Flight 110''' was an international scheduled airline flight operated by [[Avianca El Salvador|TACA Airlines]], traveling from [[Belize]] to [[New Orleans]]. On May 24, 1988, the [[Boeing 737 Classic#737-300|Boeing 737-300]] lost power in both engines, but its pilots made a successful [[deadstick landing]] on a grass [[levee]] adjacent to [[NASA]]'s [[Michoud Assembly Facility]], with no one aboard sustaining more than minor injuries, and with only minor damage to the aircraft. After engine replacement, the aircraft was able to take off from the disused runway at Michoud and subsequently returned to service.

==Flight history==
The aircraft, a [[Boeing 737 Classic#737-300|Boeing 737-3T0]] ([[Aircraft registration|tail number]] N75356, serial number 23838), had first flown on January 26, 1988, and had been in service with TACA for about two weeks.&lt;ref name=AirFleets&gt;{{cite web |title=Southwest Airlines N697SW |url=http://www.airfleets.net/ficheapp/plane-b737-23838.htm |work=AirFleets.net |access-date=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On this day, the flight proceeded normally, taking off from [[Belize City]]'s [[Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport]] and flying over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] toward the [[Louisiana]] coast.

The airliner was the 1,505th Boeing 737 manufactured, and was originally acquired by TACA from Polaris Aircraft Leasing in May 1988.

The captain of the flight was Carlos Dardano. At just 29 years of age, Dardano had already amassed 13,410 flight hours. Almost 11,000 of these hours were as pilot in command. Earlier in his career, he had lost an eye to [[crossfire]] on a short flight to [[El Salvador]], where [[Salvadoran Civil War|civil war]] was raging at the time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Nowhere to Land |episodelink= |access-date= |series=[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]] |station=[[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic Channel]] |date=March 9, 2012 |began= |ended= |season=11 |number=11 |minutes=4 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first officer, Dionisio Lopez, was also very experienced, with more than 12,000 flight hours logged. Captain Arturo Soley, an instructor pilot, was also in the cockpit, monitoring the performance of the new 737.

==Incident==
Investigation by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) revealed that during descent from [[Flight level|FL]] 350 (about {{convert|35000|ft|disp=or}}) in preparation for their impending arrival at [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport|New Orleans International Airport]], Captain Dardano and First Officer Lopez noticed areas of light to moderate precipitation in their path, depicted as green and yellow areas on their [[weather radar]], as well as "some isolated red cells" indicative of heavy precipitation to both sides of their intended flight path.&lt;ref name=NTSB&gt;{{cite web|title=NTSB Report FTW88IA109 |url=http://ntsb.gov/ntsb/brief.asp?ev_id=20001213X25693&amp;key=1 |date=March 25, 1991 |access-date=October 7, 2010 |author=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120235842/http://ntsb.gov/ntsb/brief.asp?ev_id=20001213X25693&amp;key=1 |archivedate=January 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flight entered clouds at FL 300 (about {{convert|30000|ft|disp=or}}), the crew selecting "continuous ignition" and turning on [[ice protection system|engine anti-ice]] to protect their [[turbofan|turbofan engines]] from the effects of precipitation and [[Atmospheric icing|icing]], either of which is capable of causing a [[flameout]], where the engines lose all power. Despite flying a route between the two areas of heavy precipitation shown on radar, they encountered heavy rain, [[hail]], and [[turbulence]]. Passing through {{convert |16500 |ft}}, both engines flamed out, leaving the jet [[Gliding flight|gliding]] with neither engine producing thrust or electrical power. The [[auxiliary power unit]] (APU) was started as the plane descended through {{convert |10500 |ft}}, restoring electrical power. While attempts to "[[Flameout#Windmill restart|windmill start]]" the engines using the airflow generated by the plane's descent were unsuccessful, the pilots were later able to start them using the engine starters, which were powered by the APU. However, neither engine would accelerate to normal idle speed, much less to a point where it was producing meaningful thrust. Attempts to advance the throttles only resulted in overheating of the engines, so they were once more shut down to avoid [[catastrophic failure]]. 

At this point, the pilots began to prepare for a ditching, as no runway was reachable with the remaining altitude. Dardano lined up with a canal and prepared the aircraft for a water landing. During this time, Lopez spotted a grass [[levee]] to the right of the canal, and suggested that the landing be attempted there. Dardano agreed, and landed the airliner in an unpowered glide on top of the narrow grass levee. Adjacent to the levee was the [[NASA]] [[Michoud Assembly Facility]] industrial complex, in the [[Michoud, Louisiana|Michoud]] area of eastern New Orleans, near the [[Gulf Intracoastal Waterway]].&lt;ref name=NTSB/&gt;

==Investigation and aftermath==
[[File:TACA 110 turbine damage overview.jpg|thumb|upright|Engine turbine damage from TACA Flight 110]]
NTSB investigators determined that the aircraft had inadvertently flown into a level 4 [[thunderstorm]] and that water ingestion had caused both engines to flame out despite their being certified as meeting [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) standards for water ingestion. The aircraft suffered mild hail damage, and its right-side (number 2) engine was damaged from overheating.&lt;ref name=NTSB/&gt;

To avoid similar problems in the future, the engine manufacturer, [[CFM International]], modified the [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56]] engine by adding a sensor to force the combustor to continuously ignite under heavy rain and/or hail conditions. Other modifications were made to the engine nose cone and the spacing of the fan blades to better deflect hail away from the engine core. Also, additional bleed doors were added to drain more water from the engine.

===Return to service===
Initially, it was planned to remove the wings and transport the airplane to a repair facility by barge, but Boeing engineers and test pilots decided to perform an engine change on site.  The aircraft was towed from the levee to the nearby NASA facility, fueled to the minimum amount needed and departed from Saturn Boulevard, a roadway built atop the original second world war era runway.&lt;ref name=NTSB/&gt;&lt;ref name="UPI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Emergency-shortened flight is completed |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/06/06/Emergency-shortened-flight-is-completed/6569581572800/ |publisher=UPI |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=en |date=June 6, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following takeoff, the 737 flew to [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport|Moisant Field]], where further maintenance work was performed. 

After its return to service, the plane was eventually acquired by [[Southwest Airlines]] as registration N697SW.  It continued in service until December 2016, when it was retired and placed into storage at [[Pinal Airpark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boeing 737 - MSN 23838 - N697SW - Southwest Airlines|url=http://www.airfleets.net/ficheapp/plane-b737-23838.htm|website=Airfleets.net |access-date=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flight history for aircraft - N697SW|url=https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n697sw|website=Flightradar24|access-date=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightradar24.com/data/airplanes/n697sw/|title=N697SW - Aircraft info and flight history|publisher=|access-date=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Green Bubble''' is a [[theory]] that the world is facing an over-investment in renewable energy and that the current levels of debts in many clean tech companies are unsustainable. As the interest rate rises many of the projects that are on the market today will go bust, which is claimed to become a big set-back for the renewable energy industry.

The term has been mentioned by several experts and articles and among them are: The book called "The Green Bubble"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Green Bubbe|last=Wimmer|first=Per|publisher=LID Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-1-907794-89-6|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  written by [[Per Wimmer]], a Danish investor, an article written in a magazine called "Wired"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/01/ff_solyndra/all/|title=Why the Clean Tech Boom Went Bust|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that stresses on what happened to the solar energy companies (i.e. [[Solyndra]] for example), and the article written by [[Ted Nordhaus]] and [[Michael Shellenberger]] in 2009, "The Green Bubble: Why Environmentalism Keeps Imploding".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/62327/the-green-bubble|title=The Green Bubble|last=Nordhaus|first=Ted|date=May 20, 2009|work=New Republic|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article summarizes the history of green technology and the changes in the investments in this domain. In addition, a discussion on whether there is a bubble in green technology or not.

== History of development in green technology ==

The history of green technology, also known as [[renewable energy]], is not quite new. According to Alexis Madrigal, author of “Powering the Dream: The History and Promise of Green Technology,” a large number of windmills and solar heaters already existed in the early 20th century. Despite the fact that various green technologies have been used for centuries, the history of minor technologies is quite obscure since there are a few credible records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Powering the dream : the history and promise of green technology|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis|publisher=Cambridge, MA, Da Capo Press|year=2011|isbn=9780306818851|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 21st century, there has been a large development and investment in renewable energy industry such as [[hydroelectricity]], [[wind power]], [[Solar thermal energy|solar thermal]], and [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]]. It is known that a “mini green bubble” had already taken place between 2005 to 2007, being terminated by the recession in 2007.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Julie|year=2010|title=green bubble?|url=|journal=Entrepreneur|volume=38|pages=51–54|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bubble made a drastic fluctuation in stock prices of companies with respect to green technology; for instance, the stock price of World Water &amp; Solar technologies Inc., which deals with solar powered water pump, once experienced a steep rise from 5 cents to $2.50 in 2007, subsequently facing a decline to 29 cents after the recession.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, the whole amount of global investment on renewable energy still increased until 2011, from $40 billion in 2004 to $279 billion in 2011. By contrast, the amount of investment decreased between 2011 and 2013, from $279 billion to $214 billion. This decline is said to be attributed to the improvement in the efficiency of technology costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.statista.com/chart/2719/global-renewable-energy-investment/|title=Global Renewable Energy Investment Fell in 2013|last=McCarthy|first=Niall|date=Sep 16, 2014|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Has a Green Bubble Formed? Facts and History ==

''Are we Headed toward a Green Bubble''?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is the name of an article by Julie Bennet, which provides interesting facts and opinions regarding green technology markets. Bennet suggested that a little Green Bubble deflated during [[Subprime mortgage crisis|Sub-Prime Crisis]] in 2007 and the green market was in a pivotal time in 2010: If the economy was recovered, the green market may have emerged or simply a green bubble may have exploded. The article argued high promises from the green tech sector that may not be accomplished. For example, [[Clean Edge|CleanEdge]] predicted that global markets for bio fuels, wind and solar energy will reach $ 325 billion by 2018. However, only 3.4% of total electricity expended in the U.S. came from renewal energy in 2010, while other related industries, including electric cars and solar energy, are still not competitive in their markets.

Juliet Eilperin's article "Why the Clean Tech Boom Went Bust",&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; provided some evidence regarding the fact that [[green technology]] sector was not growing as fast as the market expected. The article argued that The Obama administration, during 2009, tried to increase the investment in [[green technology]] markets, providing US$150 billion for development. [[Green technology|Green Technology]] markets may receive more subsidies for development than any other technology industries, Eliperin indicated. Another interesting fact provided by Eilperin's article is the highly divided nature of the [[green technology]] market. According to [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[green technology]] market is divided into 46 different categories and It could be possible to find some specific markets with emerging bubbles.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dempsey|first=P.|year=|title=Green Bubble? [Analysis]|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx5/10908/4719894/04782210.pdf?tp=&amp;arnumber=4782210&amp;isnumber=4719894&amp;tag=1|journal=Engineering Technology|volume=3|pages=12–13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid Lifset in "Beyond the Green Bubble" provided a new point: [[green technology]] market is following the issue-attention cycle studied by Downs in "Up and down the ecology, 1972", which basically emphasized the cycle idea of a market governed by public policy. Lifset suggested that there was a Green Bubble before Sub-Prime Crisis, which could have provided opportunities for new investors in the market. He also argued that the green technology market will maintain its enthusiasm, mostly encouraged by government agencies.

[[Image: Hot metalwork.jpg|thumb|[[Thermal radiation]] in visible light can be seen on this hot metalwork.]]

'''Thermal energy''' can refer to several distinct thermodynamic quantities, such as the [[internal energy]] of a system; [[heat]] or [[sensible heat]], which are defined as types of transfer of energy (as is [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]); or for the [[kT (energy)|characteristic energy of a degree of freedom]] in a thermal system &lt;math&gt;kT&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is [[temperature]] and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

== Relation to heat and internal energy ==
Heat is energy transferred spontaneously from a hotter to a colder system or body.&lt;ref name=speyer&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermal Analysis of Materials|author=Robert F. Speyer|publisher=Marcel Dekker, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=0-8247-8963-6|series=Materials Engineering|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=leland&gt;{{citation|title=Basic Principles of Classical and Statistical Thermodynamics|author=Thomas W. Leland, Jr.|editor=G. A. Mansoori|url=http://www.uic.edu/labs/trl/1.OnlineMaterials/BasicPrinciplesByTWLeland.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat is energy in transfer, not a property of any one system, or 'contained' within it.&lt;ref name=speyer/&gt; On the other hand, internal energy is a property of a system. In an [[ideal gas]], the internal energy is the sum total of the gas particles' kinetic energy, and it is this kinetic motion that is the source and the effect of the transfer of heat across a system's boundary. For this reason, the term "thermal energy" is sometimes used synonymously with [[internal energy]]. (Heat and work depend on the way in which an energy transfer occurred, whereas internal energy is a [[state function|property of the state of a system]] and can thus be understood even without knowing how the energy got there.) The term "thermal energy" is also applied to the energy carried by a heat flow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Neil |last1=Ashcroft |author-link1=Neil Ashcroft |first2=N. David |last2=Mermin |author-link2=N. David Mermin |title=Solid State Physics |year=1976 |quote=We define the thermal current density &lt;math&gt;{\bf j}^q&lt;/math&gt; to be a vector parallel to the direction of heat flow, whose magnitude gives the thermal energy per unit time crossing a unit area perpendicular to the flow. |pages=20 |publisher=[[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt]] |isbn=0-03-083993-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although this quantity can also simply be called heat or amount of heat.

In many [[statistical physics]] texts, "thermal energy" refers to [[kT (energy)|&lt;math&gt;kT&lt;/math&gt;]], the product of [[Boltzmann's constant]] and the [[absolute temperature]], also written as &lt;math&gt;k_B T&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

==Historical context==
In an 1847 lecture titled "On Matter, Living Force, and Heat", [[James Prescott Joule]] characterised various terms that are closely related to thermal energy and heat. He identified the terms [[latent heat]] and [[sensible heat]] as forms of heat each affecting distinct physical phenomena, namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|author=J. P. Joule
|title=Matter, Living Force, and Heat
|work=The Scientific Papers of James Prescott Joule
|year=1884
|publisher=The Physical Society of London
|page=274
|quote=I am inclined to believe that both of these hypotheses will be found to hold good,—that in some instances, particularly in the case of ''sensible'' heat, or such as is indicated by the thermometer, heat will be found to consist in the living force of the particles of the bodies in which it is induced; whilst in others, particularly in the case of ''latent'' heat, the phenomena are produced by the separation of particle from particle, so as to cause them to attract one another through a greater space.
|url=https://archive.org/details/scientificpapers01joul
|accessdate=2 January 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; He described latent energy as the energy of interaction in a given configuration of particles, i.e. a form of [[potential energy]], and the sensible heat as an energy affecting temperature measured by the thermometer due to the thermal energy, which he called the living force.

==Useless thermal energy==
If the minimum temperature of a system's environment is &lt;math&gt;T_e&lt;/math&gt; and the system's entropy is &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, then a part of the system's internal energy amounting to &lt;math&gt;S \cdot T_e&lt;/math&gt; cannot be converted into useful work. This is the difference between the internal energy and the [[Helmholtz free energy]].

The '''theta meson''' ({{Subatomic particle|Theta meson}})&lt;ref&gt;http://pdg.lbl.gov/2014/reviews/rpp2014-rev-naming-scheme-hadrons.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a hypothetical form of [[quarkonium]] (i.e. a [[flavour (particle physics)|flavourless]] [[meson]]) formed by a [[top quark]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Top quark}}) and top antiquark ({{SubatomicParticle|Top antiquark}}). As a [[parity (physics)|P-odd]] and [[charge parity|C-odd]] {{SubatomicParticle|Top quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|Top antiquark}} state, it is analogous to the [[phi meson|{{SubatomicParticle|phi meson}}]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Strange quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|Strange antiquark}}), [[J/psi meson|{{SubatomicParticle|J/psi}}]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Charm quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|Charm antiquark}}) and [[upsilon meson|{{SubatomicParticle|Upsilon}}]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Bottom quark}}{{SubatomicParticle|Bottom antiquark}}) mesons. Due to the top quark's short lifetime, the theta meson is not expected to be observed in nature.

The '''Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline''' ({{lang-az|'''Transxəzər boru xətti'''}}, {{lang-tk|'''Transhazar turbaly geçiriji'''}}) is a proposed [[subsea]] [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] between [[Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan|Türkmenbaşy]] in [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Sangachal|Baku]] in [[Azerbaijan]]. According to some proposals it will also include a connection between the [[Tengiz Field]] in [[Kazakhstan]], and Türkmenbaşy.&lt;ref name=oies&gt;{{cite journal | first = Shamil | last = Yenikeyeff | url = http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/NG25-KazakhstansgasExportMarketsandExportRoutes-ShamilYenikeyeff-2008.pdf |title= Kazakhstan's Gas: Export Markets and Export Routes | publisher=[[Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]] | format=PDF | date = November 2008 | accessdate=2008-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline project is purposed to transport natural gas from [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] to [[European Union]] member countries, circumventing both [[Russia]] and [[Iran]]. It is also considered as a natural eastward extension of [[Southern Gas Corridor]]. This project attracts significant interest since it will connect vast Turkmen gas resources to major consumer geographies as [[Turkey]] and [[Europe]].

==History==

===End of 1990s===
A project to import natural gas from Turkmenistan through a subsea pipeline was suggested in 1996 by the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=rian1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of [[Russia]]n and [[Iran]]ian opposition to the project, an unresolved legal dispute over Caspian Sea territorial boundaries and a gas discovery on Azerbaijan's [[Shah Deniz gas field|Shah Deniz field]], the submarine pipeline project was shelved in the summer of 2000 and only the [[South Caucasus Pipeline]] project continued.&lt;ref name=turkishweekly1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  On 12 May 2007, an agreement was signed between Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan providing for Central Asian gas to be exported to Europe through the reconstructed and expanded western branch of the [[Central Asia-Center gas pipeline system]]. This was seen as a setback for the realization of the Trans-Caspian Pipeline although Turkmen President [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]] said that the Trans-Caspian pipeline project was not canceled.&lt;ref&gt;

===2013–2014===
An EU proposal generally named the [[Southern Gas Corridor]] project kindled interest in the Trans+Caspian pipeline as an alternative supply route to [[Gasprom]] monopoly to [[European Union]] markets. Turkmen gas would be carried along with Azeri gas from the [[Shah_Deniz_gas_field|Shah Deniz Gas Field]] by this pipeline.

===2015-2016===

One part of the [[Southern Gas Corridor]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TAP Awards Onshore Construction Contracts for Albanian and Greek Pipeline Sections|url=http://www.tap-ag.com/news-and-events/2016|accessdate=23 March 2016|date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; will be laid between Greece and Italy via Albania starting in 2016 and this pipeline will join with the [[Trans-Anatolian_gas_pipeline|TAP Pipeline]] across Turkey which is under construction since 2015 and it will meet the existing [[South Caucasus Pipeline]] at the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] border with Turkey

==Critics==
The project is heavily criticized by Russia and Iran, current transit countries for Turkmen gas. Alexander Golovin, special envoy on Caspian issues, has stated that a major gas pipeline would pose a serious, dangerous risk to the prosperity of the entire region.&lt;ref name=eurasia2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Russia has also taken the legal position that a potential pipeline project, regardless of the route it takes on the seabed, would require the consent of all five Caspian littoral states in order to proceed.&lt;ref name=eurasia2/&gt; Iran has pointed out that treaties signed by Iran and the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921 and 1940 are still in force and that any action taken without the consent of all the littoral states would be illegal.&lt;ref name=asiatimes&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In regard of the decision taken by the EU on 12 September 2011, Russia expressed its "disappointment" as it "seems to have been adopted without taking into account the internationally accepted legal and geopolitical situation in the Caspian basin," and as Caspian Sea littoral state, Russia could veto any international agreement allowing for the pipeline to be built.&lt;ref name=euobserver140911&gt;

'''Vacuum consolidation''' (or vacuum preloading) is a soft soil improvement method that has been successfully used by [[Geotechnical engineering|geotechnical]] engineers and specialists of ground improvement companies in countries such as Australia, China, Korea, Thailand and France for [[soil]] improvement or [[land reclamation]] (Chu et al., 2005).  It does not necessarily require surcharge fill and vacuum loads of 80kPa or greater can, typically, be maintained for as long as required.  However, if loads of 80kPa or greater are needed in order to achieve the target soil improvement, additional surcharge may be placed on top of the vacuum system.  The vacuum preloading method is cheaper and faster than the fill surcharge method for an equivalent load in suitable areas.  Where the underlying ground consists of permeable materials, such as sand or sandy clay, the cost of the technique will be significantly increased due to the requirement of cut-off walls into non-permeable layers to seal off the vacuum.  It has been suggested by Carter et al. (2005) that the settlement resulting from vacuum preloading is less than that from a surcharge load of the same magnitude as vacuum [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidation]] is influenced by drainage boundary conditions.

==Scooters==
Introduced in 2006, the Vectrix VX-1 was a maxi-size [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]], and was the first commercially available high-performance [[electric scooter]].&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/living/motoring/features/article1206615.ece|author=Susie Mesure|title=Vectrix electric scooter: Power to the planet |date=1 August 2006|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2007-12-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was capable of over {{convert|60|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|50|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} was reached in a little under 7&amp;nbsp;seconds, with maximum [[torque]] available from 0&amp;nbsp;rpm, a characteristic of [[electric motor]]s. It has under 250 parts, compared with 2,500 for a conventionally powered scooter,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} and has a range of up to {{convert|65|mi|km|0}} at {{convert|25|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.

In the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands and Slovenia, the Vectrix is exempt from paying [[road tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/OwningAVehicle/TaxationClasses/DG_4022042|title=UK Road Tax Exemptions|publisher=UK government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vectrix scooter uses [[Nickel-metal hydride battery|NiMH batteries]] with a manufacturer-claimed life of 10&amp;nbsp;years and 1,500 recharges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenermachine.com/index.php?pOption=post&amp;pPostId=36|publisher=Greener Machine|title=Rated—Vectrix Electric Scooter|date=June 1, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 125-volt battery pack has a capacity of 3.7&amp;nbsp;kW·h and can be recharged to 80% in two hours from a standard domestic power socket. The battery can also be partially recharged through [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/driving/features/article1744354.ece | work= [[The Times]] | title= New Vectrix could break new ground for commuters | date= 4 May 2007 | accessdate= 2007-12-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Replacement cost of the battery is estimated to be around $3,000, almost one third of the cost of the bike.

==New Vectrix==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
For much of 2010 the company rehired old and new staff and began supporting old owners with issues again.  As 2011 rolled around Vectrix introduced the VX-2&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vectrix.com/products/vx-2 Vectrix VX-2 on www.vectrix.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vectrixeurope.com/vx-2 Vectrix VX-2 on vectrixeurope.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and the VX-1 Li/Li+&lt;ref&gt;[http://vectrixeurope.com/vx-1-li Vectrix VX-1 Li Plus on vectrixeurope.com]&lt;/ref&gt; into the product line showing at some shows and updated on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.vectrix.com/press#news_194|publisher=Vectrix|accessdate=2011-08-02|date=May 6, 2011|title=Vectrix Wins "European e-Scooter of the Year" Awards for Both the VX-1 Li/Li+ and VX-2|work=Press release|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VX-1 Li is the same as the original bike but using lithium batteries of 30-amp hour capacity, for similar range and performance in a lighter bike. The Li+ has a 42-amp hour capacity, giving greater range.  The VX-2 is designed as a smaller, lighter and less expensive version of the original bike for those who don't need freeway speeds or the weight of the original.  Though it has similar range to the original, its top speed is less than half, but so is the price.  
In 2012, Vectrix entered into a distribution agreement with [[Peirspeed]] to distribute Vectrix electric scooters in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vectrix.com/file/pdf/Vectrix_Peirspeed_Press_Release_05-18-12.pdf |title=Vectrix |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515013029/http://www.vectrix.com/file/pdf/Vectrix_Peirspeed_Press_Release_05-18-12.pdf |archivedate=May 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of European distributors==
In October 2013, Vectrix lost its French distributor Italmotori after allegations of failing to ship scooters, batteries, and scooter parts required for repairs under warranty.&lt;ref name= "Scooter_infos.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scooter-infos.com/actualite-010394-vectrix-a-nouveau-sans-importateur-en-france.html |title=Vectrix : à nouveau sans importateur en France ! |author=Thomas Groussin |date=October 2013 |website= |publisher=Scooterinfos.com  |accessdate= 11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news #2 |first=Michael |last=Torregosa |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Scooters électriques Vectrix – Italmotori dénonce les problèmes de SAV

==Shutdown of US operations, final bankruptcy filing and liquidation==
In January 2014 Vectrix ceased all US operations.&lt;ref name = "region digital"/&gt; After numerous manufacturing problems resulting in failed batteries and nonfunctioning scooters, Vectrix's parent company [[Gold Peak]], a Chinese battery manufacturer, decided to close down Vectrix's  US facilities.&lt;ref name = "region digital"/&gt; Vectrix intended to maintain its Poland fabrication plant in order to continue to supply parts for its joint venture with Daimler's Smart division.&lt;ref name = "region digital"/&gt;

In March 2014 Vectrix filed for bankruptcy again, this time under [[Bankruptcy#Chapters|Chapter 7]] for liquidation of the company.  The court filings indicated assets of between $1 and $10 million and liabilities of between $10 and $50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David Harris |coauthors= |title=New Bedford electric scooter company Vectrix files for bankruptcy |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/techflash/2014/03/new-bedford-electric-scooter-company-vectrix-files.html |quote= |work=[[Boston Business Journal]] |date=March 31, 2014 |accessdate=2014-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bankruptcy trustee announced an auction of the company's remaining assets, including unsold scooters, parts, and lithium batteries, to take place in June 2014.&lt;ref name ="bankruptcy"/&gt;

==Vectrix US and PL assets acquisition==
{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}
During the liquidation process the MPTECH group acquired the majority of the Vectrix US assets from the bankruptcy trustee and relocated them to [[Wroclaw]], Poland. Six months later, the entire assets of the Polish fabrication plant were acquired by MPTECH group and part of the heavy production equipment sold to GOVECS in order to expand their production capabilities.
In June 2015, the MPTECH group restarted the production of the VX-1 and VX-2 models, equipping them with completely new battery and electronics, internally design and produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cleanrider.com/vectrix-is-back/|title=Vectrix is back!|date=2016-05-14|work=CleanRider|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the restart of operations, the new Vectrix company has re-established part of the former distribution network, restored supplier network, restored the spare parts availability, and begun market expansion plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.avem.fr/actualite-les-scooters-electriques-vectrix-revivent-en-france-grace-a-goelectrix-6598.html|title=Les scooters électriques Vectrix revivent en France grâce à Goelectrix|last=AVEM|first=Association|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''White coal''' is a form of [[fuel]] produced by drying chopped wood over a fire. It differs from [[charcoal]] which is carbonised wood. White coal was used in [[England]] to melt [[lead]] ore from the mid-sixteenth to the late seventeenth centuries. It produces more heat than green wood but less than charcoal and thus prevents the lead evaporating.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rackham, Oliver]] (2007). ''The New Naturalist Series. Woodlands''. London : Collins. {{ISBN|978-0-00-720244-7}}.  p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; White coal could be used mixed with charcoal for other industrial uses than lead smelting.&lt;ref name="Muir"&gt;Muir, Richard (2008). ''Woods, Hedgerows and Leafy Lanes.'' Pub. Tempus, Stroud. {{ISBN|978-0-7524-4615-8}}. pp. 91 - 92.&lt;/ref&gt; White coal was produced in distinctive circular pits with a channel, known as [[Q-pit]]s. They are frequently found in the woods of South [[Yorkshire]].

Nowadays white coal is made from &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realbiocoal.com/  Real biocoal]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Groundnut shells
* Cotton hulls and salks
* Castor seed shells
* Forest leaves; wood chips and shavings
* Sugarcane bagasse
* Rice husk and paddy straw
* Mustard waste
* Coir dust
* Coffee husk 
* Sunflower waste
* Maize stalks 
* Bajra cobs
* Sesame seeds oil cake 
* Wheat straw

* White coal is cheaper than coal and fire wood.
* There is no sulphur in the white coal, therefore no toxic gases.
* Moisture content is nil.
* [[Biomass briquettes]] have a higher practical thermal value.
* Briquettes have consistent quality, have high burning efficiency, and are ideally sized for complete combustion.
* Combustion is more uniform compared to coal and boiler response to changes in steam requirements is faster, due to higher quantity of volatile matter in briquettes.
* Low ash contents.
* The calorific value of the finished briquettes is approximately 3500 to 4000 [[calorie|kcal]]/[[gram|kg]].

India is fast becoming a major manufacturer and consumer of white coal. A large number of companies have switched their boiler fuels to use white coal instead of fossil fuels. White Coal manufacturing capacity is coming up in droves in the state of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan.

The production of White coal (Briquettes made of Biomass) using agricultural and forest waste is more common in [[North India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeenews.com/news595540.html  Zee News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.carbon-outlook.com/news/white-coal-becomes-popular-fuel-source-rajasthan-newstrack-india  India-carbon outlook]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yellow grease''', also termed '''used cooking oil''' ('''UCO'''), '''used vegetable oil''' ('''UVO'''), '''recycled vegetable oil''', or '''waste vegetable oil''' ('''WVO''') is recovered from businesses and industry that use the [[cooking oil|oil for cooking]].

It is used to feed livestock, and to manufacture [[soap]], make-up, clothes, rubber, and detergents.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Denis J. ''Plant lipids: biology, utilization, and manipulation''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2005, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to competition from these other industrial sectors, the [[Energy Information Administration|EIA]] estimates that less than a third of yellow grease could be spared for [[biodiesel]] production annually.&lt;ref&gt;Radich, Anthony [http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/analysispaper/biodiesel/ ''Biodiesel Performance, Costs, and Use'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It is distinct from [[brown grease]]; yellow grease is typically used [[Cooking oil|frying oils]] from [[deep fryers]], whereas brown grease is sourced from [[grease interceptor|grease interceptors]].&lt;ref name='pub32'&gt;[http://www.nrbp.org/pdfs/pub32.pdf Brown Grease Feedstocks for Biodiesel].  K. Shaine Tyson, National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Available from [[Northeast Regional Biomass Program]].  Retrieved January 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of the term==
Yellow grease can also refer to lower-quality grades of [[tallow]] (cow or sheep fat) from [[Rendering (animal products)|animal rendering]] plants.  

The term has been in use for some time. A source from 1896 describes it as follows: "Yellow grease is made by packers. All the refuse materials of the packing houses go into the yellow grease tank, together with any hogs which may die on the packers' hands."&lt;ref&gt;Brannt, William Theodore and Schaedlerm Karl.
