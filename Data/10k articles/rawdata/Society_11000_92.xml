{{refimprove|date=October 2011}}

'''''Allochtoon''''' (plural: allochtonen) is a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀλλόχθων, from ἄλλος [''allos''] other and χθών [''chthōn''] soil/earth/land), literally meaning "emerging from another soil". It is the opposite of the word ''autochtoon'' (in English "autochthonous" or "autochthon"; from Greek αὐτόχθων, from αὐτός [''autos''] self/same and again χθών [chthōn] soil/earth/land), literally meaning "emerging from this soil".

In the [[Netherlands]] (and [[Flanders]]), the term ''allochtoon'' was widely used to refer to immigrants and their descendants. Officially the term ''allochtoon'' was much more specific and referred to anyone who had at least one parent born outside the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.nl/nl-NL/menu/methoden/toelichtingen/alfabet/a/allochtoon.htm Definition by the Dutch Central Buro of Statistics (CBS) '''in Dutch''']&lt;/ref&gt; The [[antonym]] ''autochtoon'' was less widely used, but it roughly corresponded to ''ethnic Dutch''. Among a number of immigrant groups living in the Netherlands, a "''Dutch''" person (though they are themselves Dutch citizens) usually refers to the ethnic Dutch.

In 1950, Dutch descent, Dutch nationality, and Dutch citizenship were in practice identical. Dutch society consisted mostly of [[Dutch people|ethnic Dutch]], with some colonial influences and sizeable minorities of German and Flemish heritage. In 1950, most Dutch were either Catholic or Protestant, with some atheists. Decolonisation and immigration from the 1960s on altered the ethnic and religious composition of the country. This development has made the 'ethnicity' and national identity of the Dutch a political issue.

[[Dutch nationality law]] is based primarily on the principle of [[jus sanguinis]] ("right of blood"). In other words, citizenship is conferred primarily by birth to a Dutch parent, irrespective of place of birth.

==Definitions==
The Dutch [[Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek]] (CBS) used the definition that at least one of the parents is not born in the Netherlands.

A first distinction was made between first-generation and second-generation newcomers.
*A '''first-generation ''allochtoon''''' was a person living in the Netherlands but born in a foreign country and who had at least one parent also born abroad. The 'country of origin' was the country in which that person was born.
*A '''second-generation ''allochtoon''''' was a person born in the Netherlands with at least one parent born in a foreign country. When both parents were born abroad, the 'country of origin' was taken to be that of the mother. If one parent was born in the Netherlands, the 'country of origin' was the other parent's country of birth.
Note that someone who was born abroad, but with both parents born in the Netherlands, was an ''autochtoon''.

A further distinction was made between "Western" and "non-Western" ''allochtoon'' people. A '''non-Western ''allochtoon''''' was someone whose 'country of origin' was or lied in [[Turkey]], [[Africa]], [[Latin America]] and [[Asia]], with the exception of [[Indonesia]] (or the former [[Dutch East Indies]]) and [[Japan]].

This last distinction was made because the official definition of ''allochtoon'' deviated from the common use in popular speech, where people referred to someone as ''allochtoon'' only when that person was an immigrant or an asylum seeker who was clearly distinct in [[ethnicity]], clothing or behaviour from the traditional Dutch society. However, in the official sense, the largest group of ''allochtoon'' people were of [[Germany|German]] ancestry. The groups that people usually thought of when they heard the word ''allochtoon'' were those of [[Turkey|Turkish]], [[Morocco|Moroccan]], [[Suriname]]se and Dutch-Antillean ancestry. As of 2006, the first three groups comprise roughly 350,000 people each, together constituting just over 6% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/Table.asp?LYR=G2:0,G4:0,G5:6&amp;LA=nl&amp;DM=SLNL&amp;PA=71090ned&amp;D1=a&amp;D2=a,!2-3&amp;D4=a&amp;HDR=T&amp;STB=G3,G1 "Bevolking per maand; leeftijd, geslacht, herkomst, generatie"]. [[Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek]], 23 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; So a new term was introduced that lied closer to that meaning, "niet-westers ''allochtoon''", which excluded ''allochtoon'' people from Europe, Japan (a developed high income country) and Indonesia (a former colony), but not those from the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and Suriname, even though the Netherlands Antilles are part of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] and those from Suriname immigrated when that country was still part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This definition coincided better with the popular conception of the word as signifying people of low socio-economic status who are "different from us".

Although some viewed the usage of ''allochtoon'' as a stigma, several members of the [[Dutch monarchy|Dutch Royal Family]] were officially ''allochtoon'' people, as one of the parents was foreign-born. This included 'western-allochtoon' current monarch [[Willem Alexander]], as well as his 'non-western allochtoon' wife [[Queen Máxima of the Netherlands]] and their children.

As of November 1, 2016, the Statistics Netherlands stopped using the terms ''allochtoon'' and ''autochtoon''. Instead, it distinguishes people with a migrant background and people with a Dutch background.&lt;ref name="nos.nl"&gt;{{cite news |title=Adviesraad overheid stopt met termen allochtoon en autochtoon |author= |url= http://nos.nl/artikel/2140743-adviesraad-overheid-stopt-met-termen-allochtoon-en-autochtoon.html |publisher=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]] |date=November 1, 2016 |accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Originally proposed as a neutral term, the use of the term ''allochtoon'' has been criticized as being stigmatizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Perils of Belonging: Autochthony, Citizenship, and Exclusion in Africa and Europe |first=Peter |last=Geschiere |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-226-28965-6 |pages=149&amp;nbsp;''ff''}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a regular stream of newspaper articles reporting statistics that unfavourably distinguish ''allochtoon'' people from the rest of the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = de Zwart | first1 = Frank | title = Pitfalls of top-down identity designation: Ethno-statistics in the Netherlands | doi = 10.1057/cep.2012.8 | journal = Comparative European Politics | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 301 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the city council of [[Amsterdam]] decided to stop using the term because of its divisive effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Amsterdam dumps the 'A' word |author= |url=http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/dutch-news/Amsterdam-dumps-the-A-word_258638.html |publisher=[[Expatica]] |date=February 14, 2013 |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, the term ''allochtoon'' is no longer used by the Dutch government.&lt;ref name="nos.nl"/&gt;

'''Anti-nuclear organizations''' may oppose [[uranium mining]], [[nuclear power]], and/or [[nuclear weapons]]. Anti-nuclear groups have undertaken public [[protest]]s and acts of [[civil disobedience]] which have included occupations of nuclear plant sites. Some of the most influential groups in the anti-nuclear movement have had members who were elite scientists, including several Nobel Laureates and many nuclear physicists.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Types of organizations==
Various types of organizations have identified themselves with the [[anti-nuclear movement]]:&lt;ref&gt;William A. Gamson and Andre Modigliani.

==Activities==
Anti-nuclear groups have undertaken public [[protest]]s and acts of [[civil disobedience]] which have included occupations of nuclear plant sites. Other salient strategies have included lobbying, petitioning government authorities, influencing [[public policy]] through referendum campaigns and involvement in elections. Anti-nuclear groups have also tried to influence policy implementation through litigation and by participating in licensing proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Kitschelt.

'''[[Armenians]]''' have been present in what is now [[Romania]] and [[Republic of Moldova|Moldova]] for over a millennium, and have been an important presence as traders since the 14th century. Numbering only in the thousands in modern times, they were culturally suppressed in the [[Communist Romania|Communist era]], but have undergone a cultural revival since the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]].

==History==
{{stack|[[File:Armenii din Romania (2002).png|thumb|The distribution of Armenians in Romania (2002 census)]]}}
===Danubian Principalities===
The earliest traces of Armenians in what was later [[Moldavia]] are dated by 967 (recorded presence in [[Cetatea Albă]]). Early [[Armenian Diaspora]]s stemmed in the fall of the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni]] rule and other disasters, including the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion]]. In 1572–1574, [[Ioan Vodă cel Cumplit]] was [[Hospodar]] ([[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]]) of Moldavia, grandson of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], son of [[Bogdan III cel Orb|Bogdan III]] and his Armenian [[concubine]] Serpega.

Armenian expatriates were awarded [[tax exemption]]s at different times in the [[Danubian Principalities]]' history. Encouraged to settle as early as the 14th century, they became a familiar presence in towns, usually as the main entrepreneurs of the community – for this, in early modern [[Botoșani]] and several other places, Armenians as a [[guild]] were awarded political representation and degrees of self-rule. A considerable number of noble families in the Principalities were of Armenian [[Cultural heritage|descent]].

In [[Bucharest]], an Armenian presence was first recorded in the second half of the 14th century – most likely, immigrants from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-ruled [[Balkans]], as well as from the area around [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]] and towns in Moldavia; throughout the 19th century, a large part of Armenian Bucharesters had arrived from [[Rousse]], in present-day [[Bulgaria]]. The [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Gregorian Armenians]] were given the right to build a church around 1638 – it was rebuilt and expanded in 1685, but was damaged by the [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] attack during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|1768–1774 war with the Ottomans]].

Citizenship was bestowed on the community only with the decision taken by the international protectorate over the two countries (instituted after the [[Crimean War]] and the ensuing [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]]) to extend [[civil rights]] to all religious minorities.

===Transylvania===
[[File:Armeni in Transilvania (1850).png|thumb|left|Armenians of Transylvania (1850)]]
Armenians were present from early on in [[Transylvania]], clearly attested in a document issued by [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] [[List of Hungarian rulers|King]] [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus IV the Cuman]] (late 13th century). Here, they were even allowed to found their own trading towns, the most notable one being [[Gherla]], called ''Armenopolis''/''Armenierstadt'' or ''Hayakaghak'' (Հայաքաղաք). The second important Armenian town in Transylvania is Dumbrăveni (Elisabethstadt).

Despite their increasing autonomy, the townspeople's adherence to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was nonetheless demanded (a conversion begun through the efforts of a [[Botoșani]]-born prelate, [[Oxendius Vărzărescu]]), and further submitted to forced integration by the [[Habsburg monarchy]] since the 18th century. The [[Ordinariate for Catholics of Armenian Rite in Romania]] is nowadays centered on Gherla, and is placed under the jurisdiction of the [[Romanian Roman-Catholic Church]] archbishops of [[Alba Iulia]].

Most Armenians from Transylvania has been [[Magyarization|magyarized]] in the last half of the 19th century.

===Romania===
After the [[Armenian genocide]] of 1915, Romania was the first state to officially provide [[political asylum]] to [[refugee]]s from the area.

In 1940 about 40,000 Armenians lived in Romania. Under [[Communist Romania|communist rule]], Armenians started to leave the country, and [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s regime eventually closed all Armenian schools.

==Religion==

The Armenian Apostolic community has a number of churches and a monastery in Romania. The church is under the jurisdiction of the See of Holy [[Echmiadzin]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. The churches include:
  
*Episcopia Armeana Hreshdagabedats Mayr Yegeghetsi (Apostolic) (Bucharest)
*Holy Cross ([[Mănăstirea Hagigadar]]) Armenian Apostolic Monastery of the Wishes (Manastirea Dorintelor, Suceava)
*Armenian Apostolic Church of Iasi (Biserca Armeana Sf. Maria, Iași)
*Armenian Apostolic Church of Constanta (Biserca Armeana Sf. Maria, Constanța)
*St. Trinity Armenian Apostolic Church of Botosani (Biserca Sf. Treime, Botoșani)
*Adormition of Holy Mother Armenian Apostolic Church of Botosani (Biserca Adormirea Maicii domnului, Botoșani)
*Armenian Apostolic Church of Brăila

There is also the Zamca Armenian Apostolic Monastery in Mânăstirea Zamca, Suceava.

==Present situation==

Since 1989, there has been an Armenian cultural and political revival in Romania. As of 2002, there were 1,780 Armenians, many of them from mixed families, and the number of native speakers of the [[Armenian language]] is 721. There is one Armenian church in Bucharest on what is called ''Strada Armenească'' ("Armenian Street"). The origin of the church is from the 17th century. But the wooden building burnt in a fire in 1781. The newer structure was built starting 1911 through the efforts of Armenian immigrants from the Ottoman Empire. The new church opened in 1915. The church is run by bishop Datev Hagopian. The Armenian community exists since almost a thousand years, and the Armenian Apostolic Diocese has a history of at least 600 years.

Also running is the Hagigadar Monastery established in 1512 with many visitors making it a tourist attraction. The community is celebrating the 500th anniversary of its establishment.

Besides the church is a two-storey cultural center with the first floor being a library of Armenian old and new books and the second floor, a museum. The library was established by literary figure Hagop Sirouni (real family name Jololian). The collection suffered after the Soviet authorities exiled him to Siberia in the 1940s and the collection was confiscated only to be returned to the Armenian community in 1987 after suffering serious losses.

The origin of the existing Armenian community is basically Western Armenian. But it suffered greatly with the establishment of communist regime, the emigration of many Armenian Romanians back to Soviet Armenia after the Second World War, the immigration waves to the West.

However the present community is being reinforced by Eastern Armenians immigrating from Armenia and other countries or by Armenian students coming to study in Romania.

The community presently publishes the periodicals ''Nor Ghiank'' (in Armenian), ''Ararat'', and the state-sponsored ''Lăcașuri de cult''.

==Notable Romanians of Armenian descent==
{{Main|List of Romanians of Armenian descent}}

Romanians of Armenian descent have been very active in Romanian political, cultural, academic and social life. Most worthy of mention would be His Holiness [[Vazgen I]], [[Catholicos of Armenia]], and [[Iacob Zadig]], a general in the [[Romanian Army]] during [[World War I]].

[[Niazi]] is a populous [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribe in Punjab to which [[Imran Khan]] and [[Misbah ul Haq]] also belong.  Attaullah developed an interest in music as a child, but music was strictly forbidden in his home.&lt;ref name="ink"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ink-on-the-web.com/2011/06/22/|work=Ink Magazine|date=22 June 2011|title=The Coke Studio Journey continues with Episode 3!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the restriction on music in his home, Attaullah secretly sought to learn more about music.&lt;ref name="ink" /&gt; His school teacher taught him [[Mohammed Rafi]] and [[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]] songs and told him never to stop singing. Attaullah tried to explain his passion for music to his parents and convince them to let him sing, but they forbade him to continue singing.&lt;ref name="ink" /&gt; Disillusioned, Attaullah left home when he was 18 years old.&lt;ref name="ink" /&gt;  He traveled extensively within Pakistan and supported himself by working from [[Mianwali]]. He is most popular in rural areas of Pakistan  and some other countries in world

==Musical career==
Esakhelvi continued his training after leaving his parents' home and often recorded himself on cassette tapes that he later distributed.&lt;ref name="ink"/&gt;

In 1972, Esakhelvi was invited to perform on [[Radio Pakistan]], [[Bahawalpur]].  That same year, he performed in a concert in Mianwali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewstrack.com/attaullah-khan-esakhelvi-a-pakistani-legend-life-history/ |title=Attaullah Khan Esakhelvi – A Pakistani Legend life History |last1=Abdullah |first1=Rana |last2= |first2= |date= |work=The News Track |publisher= |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Esakhelvi performed on the television show [[Neelam Ghar]] in 1973.

He was invited by a company in [[Faisalabad]] to record folk songs in their studio, and recorded four albums in one recording session.&lt;ref name="ink" /&gt; The albums were released at the end of 1977 and became national bestsellers.&lt;ref name="ink" /&gt;

In 1980, Esakhelvi performed in the [[United Kingdom]] for the first time. It was also his first concert abroad. His albums were eventually released in UK under various labels, including Hi-tech, OSA and Moviebox.

He has performed ''[[Na`at]]'' and ''Kalaam'' of famous [[Sufism|Sufi]] poets, such as [[Mian Muhammad Bakhsh]]'s ''Saiful Maluk'' and [[Bulleh Shah]]'s ''Keey Bay Dardan Sang Yaree.''He also sang song of Sadiq (a famous siraiki poet).

==Popularity in India==

Attaullah Khan visited India during 2014. ''[[The Times of India]]'' wrote: "TNN | Apr 17, 2014, 12.00 AM IST: A Sufi concert, Ibaadat, organized in association with Navbharat Times, was recently held at Purana Quila in the capital. Pakistani folk singer Attaullah Khan performed for the first time in Delhi at this event. Khan sang his Achha Sila Diya Tune Mere Pyaar Ka, and other Pakistani Sufi hits for the audience. The concert was organized by the AAS group, an NGO which works to spread awareness about cervical cancer among women and ways to prevent it, and this concert was organized to spread that message." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/events/delhi/Pakistani-folk-singer-Attaullah-Khan-performed-during-A-Sufi-concert-at-Purana-Quila-in-Delhi/articleshow/33829774.cms?|title=Pakistani folk singer Attaullah Khan performed during a Sufi concert at Purana Quila in Delhi - Times of India|author=|date=|website=indiatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Attaullah Khan had gained a lot of popularity in India during the 1990s. There were stories about his failed love which were doing rounds. While these were all fake, many people in India had taken them to be true. These added to his popularity and at one point of time, he had become almost a cult figure.

==Personal life==

Attaullah Khan is from district Mianwali and his hometown is Esakhel.He received his early education from Esakhel. He is traditionally considered as a Seraiki artist.

Attaullah relocated to [[Lahore]] after becoming a professional musician performing in [[Saraiki dialect|Seraiki]], [[Urdu]] and English. He has been married four times and has four children. His daughter [[Laraib Atta]] is a professional [[VFX]] artist who has worked for several Hollywood films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=I hope to work on projects in Pakistan, says Hollywood VFX artist Laraib Atta|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1204684/i-hope-to-work-on-projects-in-pakistan-says-hollywood-vfx-artist-laraib-atta|accessdate=5 September 2015|work=[[DAWN.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistani visual effects prodigy making waves in Hollywood|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/947985/meet-laraib-atta-pakistani-visual-effects-prodigy-in-hollywood/|accessdate=5 September 2015|work=[[The Express Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son Sanwal Khan Esakhelvi is also pursuing a career in music.&lt;ref name="tribune.com.pk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1079734/attaullah-khan-esakhelvi-on-what-makes-him-the-common-mans-artist/|title=Attaullah Khan Esakhelvi on what makes him the common man’s artist - The Express Tribune|author=|date=6 April 2016|website=tribune.com.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
He is considered a folk icon in his home country and considered as one of the most popular singers in its history. The constant companion of Pakistani truck drivers is the lilting tunes of Attaullah Khan Esakhelvi. This Mianwali-born vocalist with his swashbuckler moustache, kameez shalwar and shawl on one shoulder became the poster boy for traditional Pakistani music.&lt;ref name="tribune.com.pk"/&gt;

Singing in Seraiki, the dialect of Punjabi that dominates western and southern Punjab, his searing impassioned songs caught on like wildfire almost from the moment he recorded his first session for Radio Pakistan Bahawalpur in the mid 1970s. For years, Esakhelvi reigned supreme and unchallenged, in a universe that existed parallel to the cultured music salons of the elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/718181/between-hair-salons-and-coke-studio-pakistani-singer-attaullah-khan-esakhelvi-conquers-all|title=Between hair salons and Coke Studio, Pakistani singer Attaullah Khan Esakhelvi conquers all|first=Nate|last=Rabe|date=|website=scroll.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Pakistan]] awarded him the [[Pride of Performance Awards (1990–1999)|Pride of Performance Award]] in 1991.

He has recorded more than 50,000 songs in seven languages.&lt;ref name="tribune.com.pk"/&gt; He has received a lifetime achievement award from [[Queen Elizabeth II]] of Great Britain, and had his name entered in the  [[Guinness Book of World Records]] in 1994 for the highest number of audio albums released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/lifestyle/guinness-world-records-holder-attaullah-esakhelvi-turns-65/|title=Guinness world record holder Attaullah Esakhelvi turns 65|author=|date=|website=dailypakistan.com.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3594">The '''Benjamin Prize''' was established as a [[Norway|Norwegian]] prize to counter [[racism]] in 2002.  The prize is awarded in memory of [[Benjamin Hermansen]], who at the age of 15 years, was murdered in [[Holmlia]], [[Søndre Nordstrand]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].  The death was racially motivated.&lt;ref&gt;This article was translated at request from the Norwegian Wikipedia article on this subject (retrieved 11 October 2008). See the interwiki link for the material in the original in Norwegian.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The prize is awarded each year on 27 January in conjunction with the commemoration of the [[Holocaust]].

Today, the Borjigid are found in most of Mongolia, Inner Mongolia and [[Xinjiang]],&lt;ref name="Humphrey, p. 27"/&gt; although genetic research has shown that [[descent from Genghis Khan]] is common in Central Asia.

== Origin ==
{{See also|Family tree of Genghis Khan}}
The patrilineage began with Blue-grey [[Wolf]] (Börte Chino) and Fallow [[deer|Doe]] (Gua Maral). According to ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', their 11th generation descendant Dobu Mergen's widow [[Alan Gua]] the Fair was impregnated by a ray of light.&lt;ref&gt;''The Secret History of the Mongols'', chapter 1, §§ 17, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Her youngest son became the ancestor of the later Borjigid.&lt;ref&gt;Franke, Twitchett &amp; Fairbank, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Bodonchar Munkhag]], who along with his brothers sired the entire Mongol nation.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]], many of the older Mongolian clans were founded by members of the Borjigin — [[Barlas]], Urud, [[Manghud]], [[Taichiut]], [[Chonos tribe|Chonos]], Kiyat, etc. The first Khan of the Mongol was Bodonchar Munkhag's great-great-grandson [[Khaidu Khan]]. Khaidu's grandsons [[Khabul Khan]] and [[Ambaghai]] Khan (founder of the [[Taichiut]] clan) succeeded him. Thereafter, Khabul's sons, [[Qutula|Hotula]] Khan and [[Yesugei]], and Khabuls grandson [[Temujin]] ([[Genghis Khan]], son of Yesugei) ruled the [[Khamag Mongol]]. By the unification of the Mongols in 1206, virtually all of Temujin's uncles and first cousins had died, and from then on only the descendants of Yesugei Baghatur formed the Borjigid.

==Name==

According to [[Paul Pelliot]] and [[Louis Hambis]], [[Rashid al-Din Hamadani]] once explained that "''borčïqïn''" designated "''en turc''" a man with dark-blue eyes ("[[wikt:اشهل|اشهل]] ''ašhal''"), and did so again without mentioning the said language, adding that Yesugei's children and the majority of their own children had had such eyes per coincidence, also recalling that the genie which had impregnated [[Alan Gua]] after her husband's death had had dark-blue eyes ("''ašhal čašm''").&lt;ref name="Histoire des campagnes de Gengis Khan, p. 118"/&gt; [[Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur]] later paraphrased Hamadani by relating that Yesugei's eyes were dark-blue ("[[wikt:شهلا|شهلا]] ''šahlā''"), that the Mongols ("''Moɣol''") called such eyes "''borǰïɣïn''" (بورجغن&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=Wy5lCWdQ5noC&amp;pg=PT41].&lt;/ref&gt;), that his sons and most of their descendants had had dark-blue eyes ("''ašhal''"), and that one recognized thus in Yesugei's lineage the characteristic sign of the genie which had visited Alan Gua and had "''borǰïɣïn''" eyes, adding that the Arabs called "''ašhal''" a man whose iris ("''bübäčik''") was black, cornea white ("''aq''"), and "''la ligne foncée circulaire qui entoure l'iris''" red.&lt;ref name="Histoire des campagnes de Gengis Khan, p. 119"/&gt; Paul Pelliot and Louis Hambis have questioned these explanations.

== Mongol Empire ==
{{See also|Appanage}}
[[File:Mongol dominions1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Mongol Empire]], ca. 1300. The gray area is the later [[Timurid empire]].]]
The Borjigin family ruled over the [[Mongol Empire]] from the 13th to 14th century. The rise of Genghis (Chingis) narrowed the scope of the Borjigid-Kiyad clans sharply.&lt;ref name="Atwood, p. 45"&gt;Atwood, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This separation was emphasized by the intermarriage of Genghis's descendants with the [[Barlas]], Baarin, [[Manghud]] and other branches of the original Borjigid. In the western regions of the Empire, the Jurkin and perhaps other lineages near to Genghis's lineage used the clan name Kiyad but did not share in the privileges of the Genghisids. The Borjigit clan had once dominated large lands stretching from [[Java]] to [[Iran]] and from [[Indo-China]] to [[Novgorod]]. In 1335, with the disintegration of the [[Ilkhanate]] in [[Iran]], the first of numerous non-Borjigid-Kiyad dynasties appeared. Established by marriage partners of Genghisids, these included the [[Chupanids|Suldus Chupanids]], [[Jalayirids]] in the Middle East, the [[Timurids|Barulas dynasties]] in [[Chagatai Khanate]] and India, the Manghud and [[Onggirat]] dynasties in the [[Golden Horde]] and Central Asia, and the [[Oirats]] in western Mongolia.

In 1368, under [[Ukhaantu Khan, Emperor Huizong of Yuan|Toghun Temür]], the [[Yuan dynasty]] was overthrown by the [[Ming dynasty]] in China but members of the family continued to rule over [[Mongolia]] homeland into the 17th century, known as the [[Northern Yuan dynasty]]. Descendants of Genghis Khan's brothers, [[Hasar]] and [[Belgutei]], surrendered to the Ming in the 1380s. By 1470 the Borjigin lines were severely weakened, and Mongolia was almost in chaos.

== Post-Mongol Empire ==
[[File:Mongolia 1500 AD.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Tumens of Mongolia Proper and vassal states of the Mongol Empire by 1400]]
After the breakup of the Golden Horde, the Khiyat continued to rule the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] and [[Kazan]] until the late 18th century. They were annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] and the Chinese. In Mongolia, the Kublaids reigned as [[Khagan]] of the Mongols, however, descendants of [[Ögedei]] and [[Ariq Böke]] usurped the throne briefly.

Under [[Dayan Khan]] (1480–1517) a broad Borjigid revival reestablished Borjigid supremacy among the Mongols proper. His descendants proliferated to become a new ruling class. The Borjigin clan was the strongest of the 49 Mongol [[Banners of Inner Mongolia|banners]] from which the Bontoi clan proper supported and fought for their Khan and for their honor. The eastern [[Khorchin]]s were under the Hasarids, and the Ongnigud, Abagha Mongols were under the Belguteids and [[Temüge Odchigen]]ids. A fragment of the Hasarids deported to Western Mongolia became the [[Khoshut]]s.

The [[Qing dynasty]] respected the Borjigin family and the early emperors married the Hasarid Borjigids of the Khorchin. Even among the pro-Qing Mongols, traces of the alternative tradition survived. Aci Lomi, a banner general, wrote his ''History of the Borjigid Clan'' in 1732–35.&lt;ref&gt;Perdue, p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th century and 19th century Qing nobility was adorned by the descendants of the early Mongol adherents including the Borjigin.&lt;ref&gt;Crossley, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genghisids==
Asian dynasties descended from Genghis Khan included the [[Yuan dynasty]] of China, the [[Ilkhanid]]s of [[Persia]], the [[Jochids]] of the [[Golden Horde]], the [[Shaybanids]] of [[Siberia]], and the [[Khanate of Astrakhan|Astrakhanids]] of Central Asia. As a rule, the Genghisid descent played a crucial role in Tatar politics. For instance, [[Mamai]] had to exercise his authority through a succession of puppet khans but could not assume the title of [[Khan (title)|khan]] himself because he lacked Genghisid lineage.

The word "Chingisid" derives from the name of the Mongol conqueror [[Genghis Khan|Genghis (Chingis) Khan]] (c. 1162–1227 CE). Genghis and his successors created a vast empire stretching from the [[Sea of Japan]] to the [[Black Sea]].

* The ''Chingisid principle'',&lt;ref&gt;Halperin, chapter VIII.&lt;/ref&gt; or golden lineage, was the rule of inheritance laid down in the ([[Yassa]]), the legal code attributed to Genghis Khan.
* A ''Chingisid prince'' was one who could trace direct [[descent from Genghis Khan]] in the male line, and who could therefore claim high respect in the Mongol and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] world.
* The ''Chingisid states'' were the successor states or [[Khanate]]s after the Mongol empire broke up following the death of the Genghis Khan's sons and their [[List of Mongol Khans|successors]].
* The term ''Chingisid people'' was used{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to describe the people of Genghis Khan's armies who came in contact with Europeans. It applied primarily the [[Golden Horde]], led by [[Batu Khan]], a grandson of Genghis. Members of the Horde were predominantly [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] — [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking people rather than Mongols. (Although the aristocracy was largely Mongol, Mongols were never more than a small minority in the armies and the lands they conquered.) Europeans often (incorrectly) called the people of the Golden Horde "[[Tartars]]".

[[Babur]] and [[Humayun]], founders of the [[Mughal Empire]] in India, asserted their authority as Chinggisids. Because they claimed descent through their maternal lineage, they had never used the clan name Borjigin.

The last ruling monarch of Genghisid ancestry, [[Maqsud Shah]] (d. 1930), [[Kumul Khanate|Khan of Kumul]] from 1908 to 1930.

== Yuan dynasty family tree ==
{{see also|Chinese emperors family tree (late)#Yuan dynasty and Northern Yuan dynasty|l1=Yuan and Northern Yuan dynasties emperor's family tree}}
[[Genghis Khan]] founded the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1206. His grandson, [[Kublai Khan]], after defeating his younger brother [[Ariq Böke]], founded the [[Yuan dynasty]] in China in 1271. The dynasty was overthrown by the [[Ming dynasty]] during the reign of [[Ukhaantu Khan, Emperor Huizong of Yuan|Toghaghan-Temür]] in 1368, but it survived in [[Mongolia]] homeland, known as the [[Northern Yuan dynasty]]. Although the kingship was usurped by [[Esen Taishi]] of the [[Oirats]] in 1453, he was overthrown in the next year. A recovery of the khaganate was achieved by [[Dayan Khan]], but the territory was segmented by his descendants. The last [[khaan]] [[Ligden Khan|Ligden]] died in 1634 and his son [[Ejei Khan|Ejei Khongor]] submitted himself to [[Hong Taiji]] the next year, ending the Northern Yuan regime.&lt;ref&gt;Heirman &amp; Bumbacher, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Borjigin nobles continued to rule their subjects until the 20th century under the Qing.&lt;ref&gt;Sneath, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|{{ill|Wada Sei|ja|和田清}} did pioneer work on this field, and [[Honda Minobu]] and [[Okada Hidehiro]] modified it, using newly discovered Persian (Timurid) records and Mongol chronicles.}}

==Modern relevance and descent from Genghis Khan==
{{Further|Descent from Genghis Khan}}
[[File:Navaanneren.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Navaanneren]], Minister of the Interior, who along with the 23rd Tushiyetu Khan Dorjsurenkhoroljav (1908–1937) was the last of the Borjigin with the title of [[Khan (title)|Khan]] in Mongolia. He was executed during the [[Stalinist repressions in Mongolia|great purges]] of 1937.]]
The Borjigin held power over Mongolia for many centuries (even during [[Mongolia during Qing rule|Qing period]]) and only lost power when [[Communists]] took control in the 20th century. Aristocratic descent was something to be forgotten in the [[socialist]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey &amp; Sneath, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]]'s associates executed some 30,000 Mongols including Borjigin nobles in a series of campaigns against their culture and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Weatherford, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Clan association has lost its practical relevance in the 20th century, but is still considered a matter of honour and pride by many [[Mongols|Mongolians]]. In 1920s the communist regime banned the use of clan names. When the ban was lifted again in 1997, and people were told they had to have surnames, most families had lost knowledge about their clan association. Because of that, a disproportionate number of families registered the most prestigious clan name Borjigin, many of them without historic justification.&lt;ref&gt;"In Search of Sacred Names".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magnier.&lt;/ref&gt; The label Borjigin is used as a measure of cultural supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;Pegg, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Inner Mongolia]], the Borjigid or Kiyad name became the basis for many Chinese surnames adopted by [[Mongols in China|ethnic Inner Mongols]].&lt;ref name="Atwood, p. 45"/&gt; The Inner Mongolian Borjigin Taijis took the surname [[Bao (surname)|Bao]] ({{lang|zh|鲍}}, from Borjigid) and in [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]] [[Qi (surname)|Qi]] ({{lang|zh|奇}}, Qiyat). A [[genetic research]] has proposed that as many as 16 million men from populations as far apart as [[Hazaras]] in the West and [[Hezhe people]] to the east may have Borjigid-Kiyad ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;"The Genetic Legacy of the Mongols", pp. 717-721.&lt;/ref&gt; but the professionalism of that study is being criticised.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The Qiyat clan name is still found among the [[Kazakhs]], [[Uzbeks]] and [[Karakalpaks]].

During the initial building of the [[Qing dynasty]], the [[Manchu]] [[Aisin Gioro]] clan had the tradition of diplomatic marriages with Mongols to earn their support. Qing rulers would make Mongol ladies empresses and major concubines. As the Khorchin were the strongest banner, the Manchus were anxious to make alliances from the [[Borjigit]]. These marriages produced two empresses and three dowager empresses of the Qing dynasty, from which [[Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang|Xiaozhuang]] subsequently became a notable grand empress dowager. Hence, it is not surprising to note that from [[Nurhaci]] to the [[Shunzhi Emperor]], all the empresses and major concubines were Mongols.

[[Empress Xiaoduanwen]] (Jerjer) was made empress in 1636, Empress of Emperor [[Hung Taiji]]. Daughter of Prince Manjusri. Known as a benevolent empress and the most virtuous of all. Made "Motherly Empress Dowager Empress" (Mu Hou Huang Tai Hou) in 1643 after the death Of Emperor Hung Taiji. She died in 1649 (Shunzhi's 6th year of rule).

[[Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang]] (Bumbutai) was historically considered the mother of Qing dynasty. She was a concubine of Huang Taiji. Daughter of Prince Jaisang and niece of Empress Xiaoduan. Made the "Enlightened Mother Dowager Empress" (Sheng Mu Huang Tai Hou) in 1643 after the death of Emperor Hung Taiji. She died in 1688 having helped [[Shunzhi Emperor]], her son, run the country till his death and [[Kangxi Emperor]], her grandson, for 25 years of his reign. This makes all Qing dynasty emperors who ruled China proper descendants of Genghis Khan. Xiaozhuang was an excellent politician who did not like to interfere in politics, unlike the notorious [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]. However, when the conditions required, she rendered her efforts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6517">'''[[Capital punishment]]''' was a legal penalty in the [[Soviet Union]] for most of the country's existence. The legal justification of capital punishment was found in Article 22 of the Fundamental Principles of Criminal Legislation, which stated that the death penalty was permitted "as an exceptional measure of punishment, until its complete abolition".&lt;ref name="ioffe87"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ioffe |first1=O. Olimpiad Solomonovich|last2=Janis |first2=Mark Weston |title=Soviet Law and Economy |date=1987 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=9024732654 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uUYjkpIx828C&amp;pg=PA205 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Western estimates, in the early 1980s Soviet courts passed around 2,000 death sentences every year, of which two-thirds were commuted to prison terms.&lt;ref name="schmemann83"/&gt; The death penalty was not applied to minors or pregnant women.&lt;ref name="vanderberg83"/&gt;

==History==
The first person to be sentenced to death by a Soviet court was [[Alexey Schastny]], Admiral of the [[Baltic Fleet]], on 21 June 1918.&lt;ref name="schmemann83"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schmemann |first1=Serge |title=In Soviet, The Death Penalty Persists Without Any Debate |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/03/world/in-soviet-the-death-penalty-persists-without-any-debate.html |accessdate=1 October 2018 |publisher=New York Times |date=3 August 1983 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditional death sentences also occurred in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="vanderberg83"/&gt; Decrees issued in 1922, 1923 and 1933 provided police with the right to carry out [[summary executions]], but they were repealed in 1959.&lt;ref name="vanderberg83"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van den Berg |first1=Ger P. |title=The Soviet Union and the death penalty |journal=Soviet Studies |date=April 1983 |volume=35 |issue=2 |doi=10.1080/09668138308411469}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death penalty was abolished on 26 May 1947, only to be reinstated in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Magnusdottir |first1=Rosa |title=Review of Hilger, Andreas, "Tod den Spionen!": Todesurteile sowjetischer Gerichte in der SBZ/DDR und in der Sowjetunion bis 1953 |url=https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=29808 |website=H-Net |accessdate=1 October 2018 |language=en |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capital punishment was extended to cases of [[first-degree murder]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="vanderberg83"/&gt;

==Capital crimes==
In addition to crimes such as high treason, espionage, terrorism and murder, the capital punishment was imposed for economic crimes, such as "the pilfering of state or public property in especially large amounts".&lt;ref name="clark16"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=William A. |title=Crime and Punishment in Soviet Officialdom: Combating Corruption in the Soviet Elite, 1965-90: Combating Corruption in the Soviet Elite, 1965-90 |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781315486635 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sUYDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT27 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hijacking of a plane became a capital crime in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=At Least Seven Die In Shootout After Hijacking Of A Soviet Plane |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/23/world/at-least-seven-die-in-shootout-after-hijacking-of-a-soviet-plane.html |accessdate=1 October 2018 |publisher=New York Times |date=23 November 1983 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic crimes===
Capital punishment for crimes against state and public property was reintroduced in 1961.&lt;ref name="kline87"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kline |first1=George L. |title=Capital Punishment For Crimes Against State And Public Property In The Soviet Union Today |url=https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1987-800-14-Kline.pdf |publisher=National Council For Soviet And East European Research |accessdate=1 October 2018 |date=May 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, two foreign currency traders, [[Rokotov–Faibishenko case|Rokotov and Faibishenko]], were retroactively sentenced to death and executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sakharov |first1=Andrei D. |title=The Death Penalty |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1978/02/09/the-death-penalty/ |accessdate=18 October 2018 |work=The New York Review of Books |date=9 February 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1987, over 6,000 people had been executed for economic crime.&lt;ref name="kline87"/&gt; The death penalty was generally applied if the crime involved sums exceeding about 150,000 rubles, though there was no fixed threshold.&lt;ref name="kline87"/&gt;

{{infobox ethnonym|Cipu|Acipu|Cicipu}}

'''Cipu''' (''Cicipu''), or '''Western Acipa''', is a [[Kainji language]] spoken by about 20,000 people in northwest [[Nigeria]]. The people call themselves ''Acipu''.

Like most [[Benue–Congo languages]], Cipu has a complex [[noun class]] system.&lt;ref&gt;McGill, Stuart. 2007. The Cipu noun class system. Journal of West African Languages, 34(2), 51-90.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a fairly complex phonology with lexical and grammatical [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[vowel harmony]] and [[nasalisation]].

Virtually all Cipu speakers speak the [[lingua franca]] [[Hausa language|Hausa]]. Many also speak other nearby languages.

==Classification==
Cipu is part of the [[Kambari languages|Kambari]] branch of the [[Niger–Congo languages]].

The most recent published classification&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Kay and Roger M. Blench. 2000. Niger–Congo in African languages: an introduction, 11-42. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has Cipu as part of the [[Kamuku languages|Kamuku]] group of [[West Kainji]] along with [[Eastern Acipa language|Eastern Acipa]]. However more detailed studies&lt;ref&gt;Dettweiler, Steve and Sonia Dettweiler. 2002. [http://www.sil.org/silesr/2003/silesr2003-003.pdf Sociolinguistic survey (level one) of the Kamuku language cluster &amp;#91;Originally written in 1992&amp;#93;.].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGill, Stuart. 2007. [http://www.cicipu.org/papers/2008-05-18_classification_cicipu_working.pdf The classification of Cicipu. Unpublished manuscript.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119143433/http://www.cicipu.org/papers/2008-05-18_classification_cicipu_working.pdf |date=2008-11-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown this to be unlikely.

==Alternative names==
The ''[[Ethnologue]]'' currently lists Cipu as 'Western Acipa'. However the name 'Western Acipa' is no longer used outside the ''Ethnologue'', and a request has been made to change the entry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cicipu.org/language_name.html The name of the Cicipu language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725171026/http://www.cicipu.org/language_name.html |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hausa language|Hausa]], the language is referred to as ''Acipanci'' and the people as ''Acipawa''.

==Geographic distribution==
Cicipu is spoken in Nigeria by approximately 20,000 people,&lt;ref&gt;CAPRO Research Office. 1995. Kingdoms at war. Jos: CAPRO Media.&lt;/ref&gt; split between [[Sakaba]] Local Government Area, [[Kebbi State]] and [[Kontagora]] Local Government Area, [[Niger State]].

===Dialects/Varieties===
The Acipu themselves recognise seven distinct varieties of Cicipu. The dialect names are as follows (with the corresponding Hausa names in brackets):
*Tirisino (Karishen)
*Tidipo (Kadonho)
*Tizoriyo (Mazarko)
*Tidodimo (Kadedan)
*Tikula (Maburya)
*Ticuhun (Kakihum)
*Tikumbasi (Kumbashi)

==Phonology==
The most common [[syllable]] type in Cicipu is CV, although there are fairly strong arguments for N and CVN. A small number of noun and verb roots begin with a V syllable. Lexical tone contrasts are found in nouns e.g. ''káayá'' ‘house’ and ''káayà'' ‘bean’, but not in verbs (although grammatical tone is important for verbs).

===Vowels===
[[File:Cipu vowel chart.svg|thumb|250px|Vowel chart of the Tirisino dialect of Cipu&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McGill|first=Stuart|year=2014|title=Cicipu|journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association|volume=44|issue=3|page=308|doi=10.1017/S002510031400022X}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Cicipu has an asymmetric six-[[vowel]] system. All vowels can be long or short, and all have nasalised counterparts. There are four [[diphthongs]]: /ei/, /eu/, /ai/ and /au/.

==Vocabulary==
A large number of Cicipu words are borrowings from the lingua franca Hausa. The pronunciation of many of these loanwords has changed to fit in with Cicipu phonology, in particular with respect to vowel harmony.

==Writing system==
Cicipu is not currently written, although a preliminary orthography proposal has been made, and a small number of trial books has been circulated.&lt;ref&gt;McGill, Stuart (ined). Some orthographic challenges for Cicipu. West Kainji Language Workshop, Safara Motel, Kontagora, 10th -12th March 2008, pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Circassians in Egypt''' refers to people of present-day [[Egypt]] who descended from [[Circassians]], the [[Europeans|European ethnic group]] native to [[Circassia|Northwest Caucasus]] (today [[Russia]]). They were deeply rooted in Egyptian society and the history of the country. For centuries, Circassians have been part of the ruling elite in Egypt, having served in high military, political and social positions.&lt;ref name="Martin W. Lewis"&gt;Lewis, Martin W. [http://www.geocurrents.info/place/russia-ukraine-and-caucasus/the-circassian-mystique-and-its-historical-roots The Circassian Mystique and its Historical Roots]. Retrieved 18 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Circassian presence in Egypt traces back to 1297 when [[Lajin]] became Sultan of Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt. Under the [[Burji dynasty]], Egypt was ruled by twenty one Circassian sultans from 1382 to 1517.&lt;ref name="GPG"&gt;{{cite book|last=McGregor|first=Andrew James|title=A Military History of Modern Egypt: From the Ottoman Conquest to the Ramadan War|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275986018|page=15|quote=By the late fourteenth century Circassians from the north Caucasus region had become the majority in the Mamluk ranks.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Massoud |first=Sami G. |author-link= |date=2007 |title=The Chronicles and Annalistic Sources of the Early Mamluk Circassian Period |url= |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill Publishers |page= |isbn= |accessdate=18 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Circassian History"&gt;{{cite book |last=Natho |first=Kadir I. |author-link= |date=2009 |title=Circassian History |url= |location= |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |page= |isbn= |accessdate=18 May 2015 }}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the abolishment of the Mamluk Sultanate, Circassians continued to form much of the administrative class in [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt Eyalet of Ottoman Empire]], [[Khedivate of Egypt]], [[Sultanate of Egypt]] and [[Kingdom of Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Martin W. Lewis"/&gt; Following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|Revolution of 1952]], their political impact has been relatively decreased.

Although many Egyptian Circassians exhibit physical characteristics attributed to their forefathers, those with far-removed Circassian ancestry were assimilated into other local populations over the course of time. With the lack of censuses based on ethnicity, population estimates vary significantly. Mainly of mixed Abaza, Adyghe and Arab origin, the [[Abaza family]] is the largest [[extended family]] with more than 50,000 members in the country.&lt;ref name="bibalex1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibalex.org/alexcinema/actors/Rushdi_Abaza.html |title=Rushdi Abaza, AlexCinema |publisher=www.bibalex.org |date= |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Afaf Lutfi Sayyid-Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali Pasha'', pp.&amp;nbsp;123–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yunan Labib Rizk, [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/762/chrncls.htm ''The making of a king''], ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]'', 762, 29 September – 5 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldschmidt2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldschmidt, Jr.|first=Arthur|title=Biographical Dictionary of Modern Egypt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p3J6IS8t74QC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=18 May 2015|year=2000|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn=978-1-55587-229-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Egypt's richest families, the family has played a long-standing role in Egyptian business life.

==History==
Circassians in Egypt have a long history. They arrived in Egypt during the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, although a small number migrated [[Ethnic cleansing of Circassians|as muhajirs in the late 19th century]] as well. The Circassians in Egypt were very influential from the 13th century. To a certain extent, they shared the same role as their other Circassian brethren who lived in neighbouring [[Ottoman Turkey]]; many were importees, deportees, slaves, but also made up many of the notable noble families, while many others were kingmakers, royal consorts, military commanders, soldiers, craftsmen and artists.

==Religion==

{{Political corruption sidebar|image=[[File:Flag of Colombia.svg|150px]]}}
'''Corruption in Colombia ''' is a pervasive problem at all levels of [[Government of Colombia|government]], as well as in the military and police forces. A general culture and awareness of this corruption permeates society as a whole.

A [[Global Corruption Barometer]] survey from 2010 found that the institutions seen as most corrupt were the political parties and the parliament, followed by the police and public officials, the judiciary and the military&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/files/content/corruptionqas/373_Colombia_Overview_of_corruption_and_anti-corruption.pdf|title=Colombia: Overview of corruption and anti-corruption|last=Gutierrez|first=Hernan|date=2013|website=Transparency International|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index, based on experts' and businesspeople's perceptions of corruption in the public sector, ranks the country 96th out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2017|last=Moreira|first=Transparency International|date=2017|work=www.transparency.org|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various factors have contributed to political corruption in Colombia including: [[drug trafficking]], [[Colombian armed conflict|guerrilla and paramilitary conflict]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langbein; Sanabria|first=Laura; Pablo|date=June 2013|title=The Shape of Corruption: Colombia as a Case Study|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00220388.2013.800858|journal=The Journal of Development Studies|volume=49|pages=1500–1513|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; weak surveillance and regulation from institutions, intimidation and harassment of whistle-blowers, and a widespread apathy from society to address unethical behavior.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The government is continuously taking steps to measure and reduce levels of corruption at all levels through anti-corruption policies.  Initiatives have also been headed by the private sector in the interest of facilitating and encouraging business activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Latin america politics: Corruption's taint|last=|first=|date=2008|work=EIU ViewsWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Corruption ==
Practices of corruption that plague politics and the judicial system are, in part, rooted in the colonial legacies of the Spanish conquest.  The Spanish Empire was known to possess a disorganised and corrupt bureaucracy, which was transplanted to its colonies, including Colombia.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://proxy.library.mcgill.ca/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/60625184?accountid=12339|title=Colombia's Inherited Corruption: A Colonial Past, Legal System, and Economic Development|last=Fajardo|first=Luis Eduardo|date=June 2002|website=proxy.library.mcgill.ca|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first courts established by the Spaniards in America were also known to be corrupt and inefficient.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, Colombia inherited the ineffective and distrusted legal system which fails to guarantee private property rights in order to promote economic investment. One of the primary ways colonial elites could make a fortune was through occupying important positions in the judicial bureaucracy of the colony and thereby capturing rents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Impacts of corruption ==
Between 1989 and 1999, corruption in Colombia is estimated to have cost the state 1% of its [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ocasa.org.co/apc-aa-files/6162636465666768696a6b6c6d6e6f70/El_fenomeno_de_la_corrupcion_y_su_influencia_en_la_economina_colombiana_entre_1960_y_1999.pdf|title = El fenómeno de la corrupción y su influencia en la economía colombiana entre 1960 y 1999|accessdate = |website = |publisher = OCASA|last = Gómez|first = Santiago Alejandro Gallón|last2 = Portilla|first2 = Karol Gómez|date = September 2000|language = Spanish}}{{dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the economic cost of corruption, other aspects of Colombian society have been affected such as the loss of credibility of politicians and the Colombian government, as well as the demoralization and disinterest of society at large in political participation.

Recent studies of criminal behavior in the country indicate that while the rate of crime grew annually about 39.7%, the criminal behavior by officials in local and national government grew 164.1%, and despite this increase there are few [[conviction]]s. The levels of administrative corruption are so high that as of 2011, the media reports of such felonies overshadow the stories on terrorism or armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://html.rincondelvago.com/corrupcion-en-colombia.html|title=Corrupción en Colombia|date=2 August 2004|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study published by Transparency for Colombia (''Transparencia por Colombia'') assessed the index of integrity of governments, assemblies, and comptrollers at the [[Departments of Colombia|departmental]] level and concluded that none of those dependencies scored an appropriate level of integrity.&lt;ref name="Romero"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ocasa.org.co/apc-aa-files/6162636465666768696a6b6c6d6e6f70/Seminario___transparencia_en_la_gesti_n_pbca.ppt |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140929225204/http://ocasa.org.co/apc-aa-files/6162636465666768696a6b6c6d6e6f70/Seminario___transparencia_en_la_gesti_n_pbca.ppt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-09-29 |title=OCASA – Seminario transparencia en la gestión pública |date=2005-11-22 |accessdate= |website=OCASA |publisher=OCASA |last=Romero |first=Gina |last2=Hernández |first2=Nicolás |language=Spanish |type=Powerpoint presentation }}&lt;/ref&gt; 51% were prone to high or very high levels of corruption.&lt;ref name="Romero"/&gt;

Colombia's modern corruption takes place mostly at the level of business between politicians and officials with private contractors and companies. The lack of ethical behavior among private individuals or organizations, and politicians has resulted in a culture known in Colombia as ''"serrucho"'' (saw), in which it is almost the norm for individuals to bribe politicians in order to be granted contracts and for politicians to add commissions and extra costs for their own benefit. Other sources of corruption come from the result of privatization of government owned institutions in which the profits are used by individuals for their own wealth.&lt;ref name="web._Hist"&gt;{{Cite web

According to Transparency for Colombia, the country ranks 70 in the [[Perception of Corruption index]]. However, the problem of corruption is a high priority to only 2.9% of the people interviewed versus violence, which is a high priority to 31.49%, and unemployment, which is a high priority to 20.7%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to a study by the [[Universidad Externado de Colombia]], corruption is one of the main factors that render doing business difficult in Colombia. 91% of entrepreneurs consider that some business owners pay bribes. 16.92% say that a businessperson will offer a bribe, and out of the 28.4% of entrepreneurs who were asked for money or favors by a government official, only 8.52% reported it to the authorities in an effective way.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.transparenciacolombia.org.co/LACORRUPCION/EnColombia/tabid/101/language/es-ES/Default.aspx|title = La Corrupción en Colombia|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Transparencia por Colombia|last = |first = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120323163515/http://www.transparenciacolombia.org.co/LACORRUPCION/EnColombia/tabid/101/language/es-ES/Default.aspx|archivedate = 23 March 2012|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transparenciacolombia.org.co/Portals/0/descargas/publicaciones/Cuaderno15%20web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719161814/http://www.transparenciacolombia.org.co/Portals/0/descargas/publicaciones/Cuaderno15%20web.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption, Poverty and Inequality ===

== Political Corruption ==
Current levels of corruption have increased steadily since 2009 and continue getting worse as the [[Office of the Attorney General of Colombia|Attorney General]] and the [[Office of the Comptroller General of Colombia|comptroller]] discover corruption at almost every level of government, from local to national. In September 2009, 48.000 government officials, including 800 mayors and 30 governors, were being investigated for corruption. The issue of corruption has not been isolated to one political party; accusations{{From whom?|date=September 2014}} of corruption span the [[political spectrum]], from right-wing conservatives in the [[Social Party of National Unity|Party of National Unity]] to the left-wing [[Alternative Democratic Pole|Democratic Pole]].{{Citation needed|date = September 2014}}

The discouragement of society from addressing the many cases of corruption in Colombia also stems from the well known immunity: only a small percentage of officials investigated for corruption are likely to suffer legal consequences. In addition, it is difficult for the judicial system to handle many investigations at lower levels. At the top, politicians avoid prosecution via political maneuvering and loopholes, sometimes under the protection of their own political party. An example of this is the attempt by the Party of National Unity to pass a bill that would protect its politicians involved in the [[parapolitics scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colombiareports.com/opinion/the-colombiamerican/5976-corruption-colombias-biggest-problem-is-only-getting-worse.html|title=Corruption: Colombia’s biggest problem is only getting worse|work=Colombia News - Colombia Reports|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colombia's corruption is also the result of a long coexistence between the drug trafficking and a rush of society members to achieve easy wealth, thus rendering every aspect of society vulnerable to corruption, from politics, to agriculture and sports.

=== Corruption within institutions ===

Many institutions in Colombia have been the subject of administrative corruption. Examples of large institutions, that span across industries and have been involved in major cases of corruption, include: ''Ferrovias'' (national railroad administration), ''Caprecom'' (health care), ''Foncolpuertos'' (ports authority), ''Termorrio'' (energy), ''Dragacol'' (civil engineering), ''Chivor reservoir'' (water supply), and contracts with foreign companies such as Mexican [[w:es:Empresas ICA|ICA]] for the pavement of streets in [[Bogota]].

=== National-level Corruption ===

=== Municipal-level Corruption ===
Levels of corruption at the local level (towns, cities) has been increasing since the 1990 relative to corruption levels at the national scale&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Politic scandals==
''Colombian corruption scandals''  are often related to the [[Colombian Armed Conflict|conflict]] that has affected Colombia for 50 years.

*The [[Proceso 8000]], the legal investigation to the events that happened in the middle-1990s, when the president of Colombia, [[Ernesto Samper]], was accused of receiving money from [[drug lord]]s for his electoral campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/27/world/colombia-president-s-aide-linked-to-drug-money.html|title=Colombia President's Aide Linked to Drug Money|date=27 July 1995|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Colombian parapolitics scandal]], which debuted in 2006, revealed links between politicians and paramilitaries. Supporters of [[Álvaro Uribe]]'s government are involved in this scandal.
*The [[Yidispolitics Scandal]], caused by declarations of the Colombian ex-representative, [[Yidis Medina]], in which she claims that Colombian government offered her important jobs and money if she voted for the approval of Uribe's reelection.&lt;ref name="LIBRO"&gt;{{cite news | language=Spanish |url=http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/545401.asp|title=Libro revelará los sobornos, promesas y presiones para aprobar la primera reelección de Uribe|date=2008-07-02|accessdate=2008-04-20|publisher=[[Caracol Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elespectador1"&gt;{{cite web|work=Norbey Quevedo|publisher=[[El Espectador (periódico)|El Espectador]]|url=http://elespectador.com/node/8040/ |title=Votar la reelección me mató|date=2008-03-28|accessdate=21 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 2006 [[Colombian parapolitics scandal#DAS scandal|DAS scandal]], in which the now-defunct Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad (Administrative Department of Security) illegally wiretapped the telephones and other communication lines of Supreme Court magistrates, judges, senators, journalists and other prominent figures perceived as opposition to the [[Álvaro Uribe]] administration.
*The 2011 DIAN (Office of taxation and customs) scandal in which the administrative staff plotted ways to steal millions of dollars from the Colombian taxpayers through a complex system of fake companies and legal loopholes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Procuraduría citó a audiencia pública a ex directores de la Dian |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/procuraduria-cito-a-audiencia-publica-a-ex-directores-de-la-dian_9915785-4 |newspaper=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |date=15 July 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2011 a number of mayors in different departments misused money that was supposed to help Colombians that were affected by floods. Instead of using this money for the victims this officials used the funds for political campaigns and personal matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Investigan a 17 alcaldes por mal uso de recursos para invierno |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/investigan-a-17-alcaldes-por-mal-uso-de-recursos-para-invierno_10311287-4 |newspaper=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |date=7 September 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2011 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006041307/http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/investigan-a-17-alcaldes-por-mal-uso-de-recursos-para-invierno_10311287-4 |archivedate=6 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In September 2011 former mayor of Bogota [[Samuel Moreno]] was convicted for irregularities in contracts with private businesses, under a scandal named "contract carousel" by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Samuel Moreno, a la cárcel por el carrusel de la contratación |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/detencion-de-samuel-moreno_10420384-4 |newspaper=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=23 September 2011 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006042511/http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/detencion-de-samuel-moreno_10420384-4 |archivedate=6 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In February 2014 a massive corruption network within the Colombian army was exposed. High-ranking military officers siphoned money and took bribes in order to grant contracts. Some of this senior officers took bribes up to 50% of the cost of the contracts they awarded. Other elements of the military were taking money that was intended to be used for military supplies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-26220187|title=BBC News - Colombian leader 'outraged' by army corruption claims|work=BBC News|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In February 2018, the ''Corte Suprema de Justicia'' leaked audios in which ex-president [[Alvaro Uribe]] talks with ''Juan Guillermo Villegas'', investigated for paramilitarism, about manipulating witnesses in a case against ''Ivan Cepeda''; a Colombian senator. Uribe knew they were being intercepted, and literally says "those sons of bitches are hearing this call".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/esos-hijueputas-escuchan-todo-juan-villegas-hablando-con-alvaro-uribe-articulo-740858|title="Esos hijueputas escuchan todo": Juan Villegas hablando con Álvaro Uribe|work=El Espectador|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ephebos''''' (ἔφηβος) (often in the plural '''''epheboi'''''), also anglicised as '''''ephebe''''' (plural: '''''ephebes''''') or archaically '''''ephebus''''' (plural: '''''ephebi'''''), is a [[Greek language|Greek]] term for a male [[adolescent]], or for a social status reserved for that age, in [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]].

==History==
===Greece===
[[Image:Kouros' Head, Acropolis' museum, Athens.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Blond Kouros's Head of the Acropolis]] museum in [[Athens]].]]
Though the word can simply refer to the adolescent age of young men of training age, its main use is for the members, exclusively from that age group, of an official institution (''ephebeia'') that saw to building them into citizens, but especially training them as soldiers, sometimes already sent into the field; the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city state]] (''[[polis]]'') mainly depended, as the [[Roman republic]] before [[Gaius Marius]]' reform, on its militia of citizens for defense.

In regards to Greek mythology, the ephebe was a young man or initiate, around the ages of 17 to 18, who was put through a period of isolation from his prior community, usually the world of his mother, where he was a child in the community. The ephebe would need to hunt, rely on his senses, on aggression, stealth, and trickery to survive. At the end of the initiation, the ephebe was reincorporated back into society as a man. The idea was that if the community was ever threatened, its men would have these skills needed to protect it.

===Rome===
In Rome, where the elite (mainly [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]) were often sent to Greece or received Greek teachers, the Greek word was adopted in the [[Latin]]ate form ''ephebus'' (plural ''ephebi''), and fixed at the 16 to 20 age bracket.

==Sculpture==
In [[Ancient Greek sculpture]], an '''ephebe''' is a sculptural type depicting a nude ''ephebos'' ([[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] examples of the type are also often known as the [[kouros]] type, or kouroi in the plural). This typological name often occurs in the form "the ''{{var|X}} Ephebe''", where {{var|X}} is the collection to which the object belongs or belonged, or the site on which it was found (e.g. the ''Agrigento Ephebe'').

'''General Workers' Union of Germany''' ({{lang-de|Allgemeine Arbeiter-Union Deutschlands}}; AAUD), was the name of factory organisations formed following the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] in opposition to the traditional trade unions. The AAUD was formed by the [[left communist]]s  in the [[Communist Workers' Party of Germany]] (KAPD) who considered [[trade union|organising]] based on [[craft|trade]]s as being an outmoded form of organisation and instead advocated organising workers based on factories, thus forming the AAUD. They were influenced by the [[industrial unionism]] of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]].&lt;ref name="Trend"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vor 80 Jahren|url=http://www.trend.infopartisan.net/trd0999/t400999.html|website=Trend|publisher=Redaktion trend bzw.

'''Gogro''' is venerated by [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]]s to protect against snake bites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurmandir.com/festivalS.php Gurmandir.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
[[Sindhi people|Sindhi]]s celebrate [[Nag Panchami]] by honouring Gogro. Traditionally, in [[Sindh]], whenever the snake charmer brought snakes, they were given some Dakhshina (alms) and also milk for the snakes. The folklore of Gogro is set from [[Kutch]] and [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jhulelal.com/impdays.html] Jhulelal.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In [[Thatta]], near Pir Pitho, there was a kingdom of king Gopichand. The King’s daughter, Vachhalbai saw a flower flowing in the river. She got the flower with her friend’s help. A saintly person's soul lived in that flower. As Vachhalbai smelled the flower, the soul entered the stomach. After a few months king came to know about pregnancy of his daughter and was also told about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jhulelal.com/impdays.html] Jhulelal.com&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, the King knew no one would believe the story. He therefore, asked four of his soldiers to take Vachhalbai in a chariot and leave her in a deserted jungle. One ox was bitten by a snake and the soldiers could not proceed with one only ox.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jhulelal.com/impdays.html] Jhulelal.com&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At this point, Vachhalbai heard a voice ementaing from her stomach: "Mother chant this mantra and sprinkle water on the dead ox." Vachhalbai and the soldiers were surprised but they did what they were told, and the ox recovered immediately. The soldiers saluted Vachhaalbai with respect and left her in the deserted place.

Over a period of time Vachhalbai gave birth to a child who was called 'Gogro'. When it cried in hunger, all the snakes used to collect there to feed him turn with their poison. This poison gave strength to the child, who with his power dug up a ditch and produced a spring of water. 'Gogro' used to play with snakes and drunk their poison.

One day a Rajput king's caravan passed by. The Rajput king was dying of thirst. Gogro gave him water on the condition that he must leave seven boys to live in the jungle. In order to save his life king Chawan left seven boys there.

Feeding the seven boys proved to be difficult. Gogro started taking more poison from the snakes. This created a discontent among the snakes and a small snake 'Han Khanu' was determined to kill Gogro; but it had a very little poison. The great snake Python 'Ajgar' gave poison to him. The Cobra said that it is a sin to kill our master. Further, he said that if Han Khanu killed Gogro,  he would devour the han Khanu. Since that time the biggest of snakes - Python has no poison and the cobra wherever it sees Han Khanu devours it.

Gogro had such a power that if he turned his eyes to the place where a snake bit, the whole poison evaporated. That is why the Han Khanu bit Gogro on his jaw where Gogro could not see the place.  While dying Gogro said to his friends "When I die you cook me and eat me up." His friends cut him in two pieces, cooked him but did not feel like eating. So they threw the full pot in the river. Some thieves got hold of this pot and ate all the pieces.  As they realised soul went to their stomach they also become realised souls and their third eye opened up, through which they could see the future. These thieves were called 'Mamooyoon Fakirs'. Many references are made to this by Dr.Gurbaxani in his poems.

Mahatam Gogro before he died, told all his friends not to bite the people without a reason and also told the people to consider snakes as their friends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jhulelal.com/impdays.html] Jhulelal.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grand Lodge of All England''' ''Meeting since Time Immemorial in the City of York'' was a body of [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] which existed intermittently during the Eighteenth Century, mainly based in the City of [[York]]. It does not appear to have been a regulatory body in the usual manner of a masonic [[Grand Lodge]], and as such is seen as a "Mother Lodge" like [[Lodge Mother Kilwinning|Kilwinning]] in Scotland. It met to create Freemasons, and as such enabled the foundation of new lodges. For much of its career, it was the only lodge in its own jurisdiction, but even with dependent lodges it continued to function mainly as an ordinary lodge of Freemasons. Having existed since at least 1705 as the ''Ancient Society of Freemasons in the City of York'', it was in 1725, possibly in response to the expansion of the new [[Premier Grand Lodge of England|Grand Lodge]] in London, that they styled themselves the ''Grand Lodge of All England Meeting at York''. Activity ground to a halt some time in the 1730s, but was revived with renewed vigour in 1761. 

It was during this second period of activity that part of the Lodge of Antiquity, having quit the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England|Grand Lodge of England]] in London, allied themselves with their Northern brethren and became, between 1779 and 1789, the ''Grand Lodge of All England South of the River Trent''. Shortly after Antiquity's re-absorption into the London Grand Lodge she had founded, the Grand Lodge at York ceased to function again, this time for good.

==York Legend==

According to the [[Masonic manuscripts#Halliwell Manuscript, or Regius Poem|Halliwell Manuscript, or Regius Poem]], probably written in the second quarter of the fifteenth century, the birth of organised English masonry occurred when King [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]] convened a grand council of the mason's trade. Later manuscripts added detail, and by the time of [[Queen Elizabeth I]] the assembly was acknowledged to have occurred in [[York]] in 926. It was convened by Athelstan's youngest son, Edwin, who appears in no other history of the period. This is usually referred to as the ''York Legend'', or the ''Legend of the Guild''. The masonic manuscripts known as the [[Masonic manuscripts#Old Charges|Old Charges]] all retell some version of this legend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masonicdictionary.com/yorkl.html Masonic Dictionary] Entry in Mackeys Encyclopedia on the York Legend&lt;/ref&gt;

By the seventeenth century the Old Charges had assumed a standard form. After an introductory prayer or blessing the [[Seven Liberal Arts]] are described, and rooted in Geometry. There follows the story of the children of [[Lamech (descendant of Cain)|Lamech]]. His three sons invented masonry, metallurgy and music, and his daughter weaving. Being forewarned of the destruction of the world by fire or flood, they wrote their science on two great pillars, one which would not sink, and the other fireproof. The pillars were rediscovered after the flood, the knowledge passing from [[Hermes Trismegistus]] to [[Nimrod]] to Abraham, who carried it into Egypt where he taught it to [[Euclid]]. Euclid in turn, taught geometry/masonry to the children of the Lords of Egypt, whence it passed back to the children of Israel who in due course used it to build the [[Temple of Solomon]]. The diaspora of masons after the completion of the temple led to masonry arriving in the France of [[Charles Martel]], whence it went to England under [[Saint Alban]]. The knowledge was lost in the wars after the death of Alban, but at Edwin's assembly at York he gave the masons their charges, and had them bring any writings they had inherited. Manuscripts in many languages were brought, and a book made showing how the craft was founded. The enduring myth of the "Grand Assembly" was continued in the first printed constitutions of the eighteenth century, making York the birthplace of English masonry, and allowing the old lodge at York to claim precedence over all the other English Lodges.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Speth, Quatuor Coronatorum Antigrapha, Vol I, 1888, part III, vi–vii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Freemasonry in York==

===Origins===

Records of the operative lodge attached to York Minster are written on the ''Fabric rolls of York Minster'' (a record of the erection and maintenance of the ''fabric'' of the building), and extend from 1350 to 1639, when the lodge became irrelevant to the cathedral. Their rules appear under the heading ''Ordinacio Cementariorum'' in the roll from 1370. 

York Lodge has a manuscript constitution dated 1693, so presumably, the lodge is at least that old.

The oldest, lost portion of the minutes of the speculative lodge commence on 7 March 1705–06. There may at one time have been minutes from 1704. The chief officer was styled President or Master until 1725, when Grand Master was adopted. 

Surviving minutes commence on 19 March 1712–13. Until 1725, there seems to have been only one lodge, its meetings termed ''Private'' and ''General'' lodges.&lt;ref name="Mackey"&gt;Albert Gallatin Mackey, The History of Freemasonry, Masonic History Co., 1906, Volume Four, Chapter XXXIX, pp. 1043–1078&lt;/ref&gt;

Familial relations have been traced between the members of the ''Ancient Society of Freemasons in the City of York'', as recorded in 1705, and the operative lodge documented there in 1663. Some sort of organisational continuity is possible. It possessed its own collection of the ''Old Charges'' of the craft, and initiated masons to meet under its jurisdiction in at least two other towns. It assumed the geographical jurisdiction of the old operative ''Grand Lodge North of the River Trent''. Its main meetings occurred twice a year on the feast days of John the Baptist and John the Evangelist.&lt;ref name="Cryer"&gt;Rev. Neville Barker Cryer, The Grand Lodge of All England at York Ritual, Cornerstone Society.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1712–1716 there were one or two meetings a year, and from 1717–1721 there were no meetings at all.&lt;ref name="Findel"&gt;J. G. Findel, History of Freemasonry, Tr. from second German edition, Asher &amp; Co, London, 1866, pp. 168–180&lt;/ref&gt;

Deputations were sent to other towns for the purpose of making masons, Scarborough in 1705, and Bradford in 1713, when eighteen ''gentlemen'' were admitted. Two important [[Masonic manuscripts#Old Charges|old constitutions]], the Scarborough and the Hope manuscripts, are attributed to these meetings.&lt;ref name="Hiram"&gt;[http://www.bradford.ac.uk/webofhiram/?section=york_rite&amp;page=grandyork.html University of Bradford] C. J. Scott, Historical Notes concerning the York Grand Lodge, 1911 (Web of Hiram)&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the Scarborough MS states that it was certified at Scarborough on 10 July 1705 and is signed by the president and his officers. The end of the Hope MS is missing, thus the attribution is not so certain. The lodge would not again expand outside of York until the 1760s. In 1707, [[Robert Benson, 1st Baron Bingley|Robert Benson]], the Lord Mayor of York, was president. Later, as Lord Bingham, he would become Chancellor of the Exchequer.&lt;ref name="Bradford"&gt;[http://www.bradford.ac.uk/webofhiram/?section=york_rite&amp;page=tradoldyork.html University of Bradford] C.

===The Grand Lodge of All England===
[[File:Francis Drake b1696.jpg|thumb|Francis Drake, who [[Albert Mackey|Mackey]] compared to London's [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|Desaguliers]] in his role in York's Grand Lodge]]

On 27 December 1725, the feast of [[St. John the Evangelist]], the York lodge claimed the status of a Grand Lodge. The burst of activity, which started earlier that year, may have been occasioned by the circulation of Anderson's constitutions, and the formation of a lodge at Durham under the jurisdiction of the London Grand Lodge. The minutes of 10 August 1725 describe William Scourfield as Worshipful Master. On 27 December, however, Brother Charles Bathurst was elected as Grand Master. His wardens (they were never referred to as ''Grand Wardens'') were Brother Pawson and [[Francis Drake (antiquary)|Francis Drake]], the antiquarian, both of whom had only been initiated in September of that year. This occurred after a procession to [[Merchant Adventurers' Hall|Merchants Hall]], and a banquet. They described themselves as a ''society and fraternity of free Masons''. From 1722, visitors were admitted on examination. In 1725, Drake delivered a speech as Junior Warden, which went unrecorded. However, as the same persons were returned to office in 1726, his speech was written down. He characterised Freemasonry with the attributes of "Brotherly love, relief, and truth", and claimed superiority over the Southern Grand Lodge. They were, he said, content that the London lodge have the title Grand Master of England, but York claimed ''Totius Angliae'' (All England). The master of 1724, (now the treasurer) Scourfield, was expelled for making masons irregularly.&lt;ref name="Findel" /&gt; Drake's speech used the York Legend to claim precedence over all other English lodges, as the first lodge was established under Edwin of Northumbria around the year 600. Here, Edwin was not the brother or son of Athelstan, and the first lodge thereby became over three centuries older. Drake refers to three classes of Freemasons, working masons, other trades, and Gentlemen. Nineteen rules were enacted as Constitutions, and meetings moved from private houses to taverns.&lt;ref name="Mackey" /&gt;

After a space, the next minutes are from 21 June 1729. The minutes then become scarce and fall silent. In 1734 some masons travelled south to obtain authorisation for a lodge in York under the jurisdiction of the London Grand Lodge. 

===1761===

It was not until 1761 that the Grand Lodge was revived, under the Grand Mastership of Drake, for a period of renewed, and more successful activity. In 1767, they wrote to London informing them that their lodge No 259, in Stonegate, York, had ceased to meet, telling them, "This Lodge acknowledges no superiors and owes subjection to none; she exists in her own right, giving Constitutions and Certificate, in the same way as the Grand Lodge of England in London has asserted her claims there from time immemorial." On 31 July 1769, constitutions were granted to the Royal Oak lodge in Ripon, and on 30 October of the same year, Brothers Cateson, Revell, and Ketar were advanced to the degree of Master Mason, before being granted a constitution for the Crown in Boroughbridge. The Royal Arch Degree was introduced in 1768, and "Knights-Templars" by 1780. In 1777 London opened the Union lodge in York, but after negotiations during 1778, the rebel half of Antiquity were accepted in 1779 as the "only regular lodge in London". Antiquity, London's oldest and most prestigious lodge, had split following a dispute with their own Grand Lodge, who interpreted a walk from church to lodge in regalia by a few of their members as an unauthorised procession. At the centre of the controversy was [[William Preston (Freemason)|William Preston]], who mediated the move. These London Masons became, for ten years, The Grand Lodge of All England South of the River Trent.&lt;ref name="Findel" /&gt;

The last minute is from 23 August 1792. [[A. F. A. Woodford|Woodford]] believed that the lodge didn't cease to exist, it was simply absorbed by the larger Grand Lodge. Unlike other Grand Lodges, it enacted all the functions of a private lodge, as well as any regulatory duties that may have arisen.&lt;ref name="Mackey" /&gt;

==Ritual==

After 1761, there was worship at the church in Coney Street, followed by a procession to York's Guildhall for a banquet, attended by daughter lodges, ladies, and non-masons. The business of Grand Lodge, where ritual was used, followed the Banquet.&lt;ref name="Cryer" /&gt;

The operative masons having formed their own company in 1671, the Ancient Society used their copies of the Old Charges as warrants. Lodges which ceased to meet were expected to return their copy.Because the old operative lodge had admitted freemen who had passed their apprenticeship, the apprentice degree at York was largely symbolic, and until 1770 candidates were made Apprentice and Fellow on the same evening. The new degree of Master was administered separately. Candidates took an oath on a bible opened at the first chapter of St. John's Gospel. They were then invested with an apron, and seated at the lodge table, where they received their instruction. From 1760, the Royal Arch, and later the Knights Templar degrees were introduced. All the time, the lectures and catechisms attached to the degrees increased in complexity, a special award being presented to the past master who gave the best rendition.&lt;ref name="Cryer" /&gt; Grand Lodge Minutes of 20 June 1780 show resolutions confirming the authority of the ''Grand Lodge'' over the ''Five degrees or Orders of Masonry''. These were -
* 1. Entered Apprentice
* 2. Fellow Craft
* 3. Master Mason
* 4. Knight Templar
* 5. Sublime Degree of Royal Arch&lt;ref&gt;William James Hughan, Unpublished Records of the Craft, Kenning, 1871, part II, pp 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Haitian Bahamian''' {{lang-fr|Haïtien Bahamian}}, {{lang-ht|Ayisyen Bahamian}}) is a [[The Bahamas|Bahamian]] resident or citizen of full or partial [[Haiti]]an ancestry. Most of whom are illegally residing in the country. The Bahamas currently does not allow dual citizenship, so those who are Bahamian citizens, must renounce their Haitian citizenship.

'''Hussaini Brahmin'''  is a [[Mohyal]] community with links to both [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]]. They are spread across Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan; Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi and other parts of India, and also in Arabia. Citing source from history of the Muhiyals, published in 1911 CE it is disclosed that about 1400 Brahmins had been living in [[Baghdad]] when the [[Battle of Karbala|event of Karbala]] took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Shafaqna|url= http://en.shafaqna.com/news/38333 | title= Who are the Hussaini Brahmins?

==Seven sons of Datt==
Among various legends about Hussaini Barahmin it is also described that a childless Dutt personally visited Hussain Ibn Ali and submitted his wish to have a child.  In response to his desire, he was informed that he had no child in his fate. Hearing that he cannot be a father of  son Dutt became senseless and broke down in crying with pain for grant of a child by [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam Hussain]] with recommendations to God.  At this moment, Hussain pacified him saying he will have one soon.  Suddenly someone observing the event questioned Hussain stating that he had challenged the will  of Allah. Upon hearing this Imam told Dutt he will have one more child. This continued till Imam gave him good news of seven children.&lt;ref name="Zeba T Hashmi, Daily Times"&gt;{{cite web|author=Zeba T Hashmi |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/opinion/17-Mar-2015/ashura-and-pluralism |title=Ashura and pluralism |publisher=Daily Times, Pakistan |date=March 17, 2015 |accessdate=November 4, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117023612/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/opinion/17-Mar-2015/ashura-and-pluralism |archivedate=November 17, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abul Fazl in Kashmir Observer"&gt;{{cite web |author=Abul Fazl| url= http://www.kashmirobserver.net/news/features/brahmins-who-fought-imam-hussain-karbala| title= The Brahmins Who Fought For Imam Hussain At Karbala | publisher= Kashmir Observer Online| date=November 5, 2014|accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussaini Brahmins used to live in [[Lahore]] till 1947 and after that date they migrated to other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sheik|first1=Majid|title=Karbala and how Lahore was involved|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/766877/karbala-and-how-lahore-was-involved|accessdate=22 January 2016|agency=Dawn News Paper, Lahore|publisher=Dawn|date=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ajmer]], [[Rajasthan]], a place of Sunni Muslim pilgrimage, where [[Moinuddin Chishti]] lived and passed his last days, there is even today a class of people who call themselves Hussaini Brahmins, who are neither orthodox Hindus nor orthodox Muslims. Hussaini Brahmins practiced a mixed blend of Hinduism and Islamic traditions. A popular saying in Hindi/Urdu language refers to the Hussaini Brahmans thus: "Wah Datt Sultan, Hindu ka dharm, Musalman ka Iman, Adha Hindu adha Musalman (Well Datt Sultan, declaring Hindu religion and following Muslim faith, Half Hindu and Half Muslman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitra |first1= Sisir Kumar |title=The Vision of India |publisher= Jaico Publishing House |location=Bombay, India |pages=229–230 (First Print 1949) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Virag Pachpore"&gt;{{cite news

'''Information processing''' is the change (processing) of [[information]] in any manner detectable by an [[observation|observer]].  As such, it is a  process that ''describes'' everything that happens (changes) in the [[universe]], from the falling of a rock (a change in position) to the printing of a text file from a digital computer system. In the latter case, an [[information processor]] is changing the [[content format|form]] of presentation of that text file.
Information processing may  more specifically be defined in terms used by, [[Claude E. Shannon]] as the conversion of latent information into manifest information (McGonigle &amp; Mastrian, 2011). Latent and manifest information is defined through the terms of equivocation (remaining uncertainty, what value the sender has chosen), dissipation (uncertainty of the sender what the receiver has received), and transformation (saved effort of questioning – equivocation minus dissipation) (Denning and Bell, 2012).

==In cognitive psychology==
Within the field of [[cognitive psychology]], information processing is an approach to the goal of understanding human thinking in relation to how they process the same kind of information as computers (Shannon &amp; Weaver, 1963).  It arose in the 1940s and 1950s, after World War II (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012). The approach treats [[cognition]] as essentially [[Computing|computational]] in nature, with ''mind'' being the ''software'' and the brain being the ''hardware''. The information processing approach in psychology is closely allied to the [[computational theory of mind]] in philosophy; it is also related, though not identical, to [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] in psychology and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] in philosophy (Horst, 2011).

===Two types===
Information processing  may  be '''vertical''' or '''horizontal''', either of which  may be '''centralized''' or [[decentralized]] ('''distributed'''). The [[horizontal distributed processing]] approach of the mid-1980s became popular under the name [[connectionism]]. The connectionist network is made up of different nodes, and it works by a "priming effect," and this happens when a "prime node activates a connected node" (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012). But "unlike in semantic networks, it is not a single node that has a specific meaning, but rather the knowledge is represented in a combination of differently activated nodes"(Goldstein, as cited in Sternberg, 2012).

===Models and theories===
There are several proposed models or theories that describe the way in which we process information.
Every individual has different information overload point with same information load, because individuals have different information-processing capacity (Eppler and Mengis, 2004)

====Sternberg's triarchic theory of intelligence====
Sternberg's [[Triarchic theory of intelligence|theory of intelligence]] is made up of three different components: creative, analytical, and practical abilities (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012). Creativeness is the ability to have new original ideas, and being analytical can help a person decide whether the idea is a good one or not. "Practical abilities are used to implement the ideas and persuade others of their value" (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012 p.&amp;nbsp;21). In the middle of Sternberg's theory is cognition and with that is information processing. In Sternberg's theory, he says that information processing is made up of three different parts, metacomponents, performance components, and knowledge-acquisition components (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012). These processes move from higher-order executive functions to lower order functions. Metacomponents are used for planning and evaluating problems, while performance components follow the orders of the metacomponents, and the knowledge-acquisition component learns how to solve the problems (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012). This theory in action can be explained by working on an art project. First is a decision about what to draw, then a plan and a sketch. During this process there is simultaneous monitoring of the process, and whether it is producing the desired accomplishment. All these steps fall under the metacomponent processing, and the performance component is the art. The knowledge-acquisition portion is the learning or improving drawing skills.

====Information processing model: the working memory====
According to thefreedictionary.com, the definition of information processing is "the sciences concerned with gathering, manipulating, storing, retrieving, and classifying recorded information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/information+processing | title=Definition of information processing | work=The Free Dictionary | accessdate=July 26, 2016 |year=2012|publisher= Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests that for information to be firmly implanted in memory, it must pass through three stages of mental processing; sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. An example of this is the working memory model.  This includes the central executive, phonologic loop, episodic buffer,visuospatial sketchpad, verbal information, long term memory, and visual information (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012).  The central executive is like the secretary of the brain.  It decides what needs attention and how to respond.The central executive then leads to three different subsections.  The first is phonological storage, subvocal rehearsal, and the phonological loop.  These sections work together to understand words, put the information into memory, and then hold the memory.  The result is verbal information storage.  The next subsection is the visuospatial sketchpad which works to store visual images.  The storage capacity is brief but leads to understanding of visual stimuli.  Finally, there is an episodic buffer.  This section is capable of taking information and putting it into long-term memory.  It is also able to take information from the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad, combining them with long-term memory to make "a unitary episodic representation (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012).  
In order for these to work, the sensory register takes in via the five senses: visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and taste. These are all present since birth and are able to handle simultaneous processing (e.g., food – taste it, smell it, see it). In general, learning benefits occur when there is a developed process of pattern recognition. The sensory register has a large capacity and its behavioral response is very short (1–3 seconds). 
Within this model, sensory store and short term memory or working memory has limited capacity. Sensory store is able to hold very limited amounts of information for very limited amounts of time.  This phenomenon is very similar to having a picture taken with a flash.  For a few brief moments after the flash goes off, the flash it seems to still be there.  However, it is soon gone and there is no way to know it was there (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012). Short term memory holds information for slightly longer periods of time, but still has a limited capacity. According to Linden (2007), "The capacity of STM had initially been estimated at "seven plus or minus two" items (Miller 1956), which fits the observation from neuropsychological testing that the average digit span of healthy adults is about seven (Cowan and others 2005). However, it emerged that these numbers of items can only be retained if they are grouped into so-called chunks, using perceptual or conceptual associations between individual stimuli." Its duration is of 5–20 seconds before it is out of the subject's mind. This occurs often with names of people newly introduced to. Images or information based on meaning are stored here as well, but it decays without rehearsal or repetition of such information. 
On the other hand, long-term memory has a potentially unlimited capacity (Sternberg &amp; Sternberg, 2012) and its duration is as good as indefinite. Although sometimes it is difficult to access, it encompasses everything learned until this point in time. One might become forgetful or feel as if the information is on the [[tip of the tongue]].

====Cognitive development theory====
Another approach to viewing the ways in which information is processed in humans was suggested by [[Jean Piaget]] in what is called the ''Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory'' (Presnell, 1999). Piaget developed his model based on development and growth. He identified four different stages between different age brackets characterized by the type of information and by a distinctive thought process. The four stages are: the sensorimotor (from birth to 2 years), preoperational (2–6 years), concrete operational (6–11 years), and formal operational periods (11 years and older). During the sensorimotor stage, newborns and toddlers rely on their senses for information processing to which they respond with reflexes. In the preoperational stage, children learn through imitation and remain unable to take other people's point of view. The concrete operational stage is characterized by the developing ability to use logic and to consider multiple factors to solve a problem. The last stage is the formal operational, in which preadolescents and adolescents begin to understand abstract concepts and to develop the ability to create arguments and counter arguments.

Furthermore, adolescence is characterized by a series of changes in the biological, cognitive, and social realms. In the cognitive area, it is worth noting that the brain's prefrontal cortex as well as the limbic system undergoes important changes. The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is active when engaged in complicated cognitive activities such as planning, generating goals and strategies, intuitive decision-making, and [[metacognition]] (thinking about thinking). This is consistent with Piaget's last stage of formal operations (McLeod, 2010). The prefrontal cortex becomes complete between adolescence and early adulthood. The limbic system is the part of the brain that modulates reward sensitivity based on changes in the levels of neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine) and emotions.

In short, cognitive abilities vary according to our development and stages in life. It is at the adult stage that we are better able to be better planners, process and comprehend abstract concepts, and evaluate risks and benefits more aptly than an adolescent or child would be able to.

==In computing==
In computing, '''information processing''' broadly refers to the use of algorithms to transform data—the defining activity of computers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dictionary of Computing | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=9780192800466 | edition=4th | first=Valerie | last=Illingworth | series=Oxford Paperback Reference | page=241|date=11 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, a broad computing professional organization is known as the International Federation for Information Processing ([[International Federation for Information Processing|IFIP]]). It is essentially synonymous with the terms [[data processing]] or [[computation]], although with a more general connotation.&lt;ref name="Ralston2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Ralston|title=Encyclopedia of computer science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQ9LAQAAIAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Nature Pub.

Dicker became a Swiss citizen in 1915. In Swiss politics, Dicker emerged as a prominent leader of the [[Swiss Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name="a"&gt;Joseph, Roger.

Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Geschichte, 2001. p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Dicker defended Nicole in a legal case in May 1933.&lt;ref name="h"/&gt;

Being a prominent Jewish political leader, Dicker was subjected to violent antisemitic attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Caillat, Michel. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ueNDAQAAIAAJ René Payot: Un regard ambigu sur la guerre]''. 1998. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; On November 9, 1932 the far-right [[National Union (Switzerland)|National Union]] convened a meeting in the municipal hall in [[Plainpalais]], a meeting intended to function as a tribunal against Nicole and Dicker. A leftist countermanifestation was organized. Violence broke out between demonstrators and army, killing 13 people and injuring 65.&lt;ref&gt;Bavaud, Pierre, and Jean-Marc Béguin.

Dicker was one of four Socialist parliamentarians that sided with the [[Swiss Socialist Federation]] when the Socialist Party went through a split in 1939.

The '''Loma people''', sometimes called '''Loghoma''', '''Looma''', '''Lorma''' or '''Toma''', are a West African [[ethnic group]] living primarily in the northern mountainous, sparsely populated regions of [[Guinea]] and [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name="loma"&gt;{{Cite thesis | url=http://anthropology.si.edu/leopold/pubs/leopold_1991_chapter2.htm | last=Leopold | first=Robert Selig | title=Prescriptive Alliance and Ritual Collaboration in Loma Society | year=1991 | chapter=2 | publisher=Indiana University | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716235904/http://anthropology.si.edu/leopold/pubs/leopold_1991_chapter2.htm | archivedate=2011-07-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppiahGates2010p84"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA643|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their population was estimated at 330,000 in the two countries in 2010.&lt;ref name="Sherman2010p211"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Sherman|title=Liberia: The Land, Its People, History and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lstRzSWEcUC&amp;pg=PA211|year=2010|publisher=New Africa Press|isbn=978-9987-16-025-9|pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are closely related to the [[Mende people]].&lt;ref name="AppiahGates2010p84"/&gt;

The Loma speak [[Loma language|a language]] in the Southwestern branch of the [[Mande languages]], belonging to the Niger-Congo family of languages. The language is similar to the [[Kpelle language|Kpelle]], [[Mende language|Mende]], [[Gola people|Gola]], [[Vai people|Vai]], and [[Gbandi|Bandi]] languages.&lt;ref name="loma"/&gt; The Loma refer to their language as [[Loma language|Löömàgòòi]] {{IPA-xx|lɔːmàɡòːi|}} or Löghömàgòòi {{IPA-xx|lɔɣɔmàɡòːi|}}).&lt;ref name="loma"/&gt; The Loma people, led by Wido Zobo and assisted by a Loma weaver named Moriba, developed a writing script for their language in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Sherman2010p211"/&gt; This writing script contains at least 185 characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA643|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|page=552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malinke]], [[Konyaka]], and [[Kissi people|Kissi]] refer to the Loma as ''Toma''.&lt;ref name="ethnologue_toma"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="loma"/&gt; Loma refer to themselves as Löömàgìtì ({{IPA-xx|lɔːmàɡìtì}}, or Löghömagiti {{IPA-xx|lɔɣɔmaɡiti|}} in Guinea).&lt;ref name="loma"/&gt; They have retained their Traditional Religion, and resisted the Islamic jihads. The Loma people called the religious conflict with [[Mandinka people]] as a historic 'rolling war'.&lt;ref&gt;Christian K.

The Loma people are notable for their large wooden masks that merge syncretic animal and human motifs. These masks have been a part of their ''Poro'' secret rites of passage. The largest masks are about six feet high, contain feather decorations and believed by Loma to have forest spirits.&lt;ref name="Olukoju2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ayodeji Olukoju|title=Culture and Customs of Liberia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOo6fCPSt0QC&amp;pg=PA61| year=2006|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33291-3|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Loma people farm rice, but in shifting farms. They are exogamous people, with patrilineal social organization in matters related to inheritance, succession and lineage affiliations with one-marriage rule. Joint families, or virilocal communities are common, wherein families of brothers settle close to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Currens | first=Gerald E. | title=The Loma Avunculate: An Exercise in the Utility of Two Models | journal=Ethnology | publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press | volume=11 | issue=2 | year=1972 | page=111 | doi=10.2307/3773294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pastor===
In 1937,&lt;ref name="Sabhapathy" /&gt; he was posted to Hacholli as Assistant Pastor and in 1940, he was ordained by C. B. Firth in [[Adoni]].  Abraham also established new congregations in Challakudlur, Ravihal, Lingaladinne and Chickbellary.&lt;ref name="Sabhapathy" /&gt; He seemed to have a good influence among Village Elders and Christians in many villages.  E. Herbert Lewis, then Missionary supervised Abraham in his work.  In 1945, Abraham was transferred from Hacholli to [[Adoni]] to a [[Kannada]]-speaking congregation.&lt;ref name="Sabhapathy" /&gt;

The '''Mari language''' (Mari: {{lang|chm|марий йылме}}, ''marii jõlme''; {{lang-ru|марийский язык}}, ''marijskij jazyk''), spoken by approximately 400,000 people, belongs to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family. It is spoken primarily in the [[Mari Republic]] (Mari: {{lang|chm|Марий Эл}}, ''Marii El'', i.e., 'Mari land') of the [[Russian Federation]] as well as in the area along the [[Vyatka River|Vyatka]] river basin and eastwards to the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]]. Mari speakers, known as the [[Mari people|Mari]], are found also in the [[Tatarstan]], [[Bashkortostan]], [[Udmurtia]], and [[Perm]] regions.

Mari is the titular and official language of its republic, alongside [[Russian language|Russian]].

The Mari language today has two standard forms: [[Hill Mari]] and [[Meadow Mari]]. The latter is predominant and spans the continuum Meadow Mari to Eastern Mari from the Republic into the Ural dialects of [[Bashkortostan]], [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]] and [[Udmurtia]]), whereas the former, Hill Mari, shares a stronger affiliation with the Northwestern dialect (spoken in the [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]] and parts of the [[Kirov Oblast]]). Both language forms use modified versions of [[Cyrillic script]]. For the non-native, Hill Mari, or Western Mari, can be recognized by its use of the special letters "ӓ" and "ӹ" in addition to the mutual letters "ӱ" and "ӧ", while Eastern and Meadow Mari utilize a special letter "ҥ".

The use of two "variants", as opposed to two "languages", has been debated: Maris recognize the unity of the ethnic group, and the two forms are very close, but distinct enough to cause some problems with communication.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== Ethnonym and glottonym ==
The Mari language and people were known as "Cheremis" ({{lang-ru|черемисы, черемисский язык}}, ''cheremisy'', ''cheremisskiy yazyk''). In medieval texts the variant forms Sarmys and Tsarmys are also found, as well as {{lang-tt|Чирмеш|Çirmeş}}; and {{lang-cv|Ҫармӑс}}, ''Śarmăs'' before the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]]. The term ''Mari'' comes from the Maris' autonym {{lang|chm|марий}} ({{lang|chm-Latn|mari}}), which is thought to have been borrowed from the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] term *''maryá-'' 'man', literally 'mortal, one who is bound to die'  ( &lt; [[Proto-Indo-European|PIE]] *''[[:en:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/mer-|mer-]]'' 'to die').

== Sociolinguistic situation ==
Most Maris live in rural areas with slightly more than a quarter living in cities. In the republican capital, [[Yoshkar-Ola]], the percentage of Maris is just over 23 percent. At the end of the 1980s (per the 1989 census) Maris numbered 670,868, of whom 80% (542,160) claimed Mari as their first language and 18.8% did not speak Mari. In the Mari Republic, 11.6% claimed Mari was not their first language. In a survey by the Mari Research Institute more than 3/4 of Maris survey considered Mari language to be the most crucial marker of ethnic identity, followed by traditional culture (61%) and common historical past (22%), religion (16%), character and mentality (15%) and appearance (11%) (see Glukhov and Glukhov for details). A gradual downward trend towards assimilation to Russian has been noted for the Communist period: the 1926 census indicated more than 99% of Maris considered Mari their first language, declining to less than 81% in 1989. Some qualitative evidence of a reversal in recent years has been noted.

There was no state support for Mari language in [[Imperial Russia]], and with the exception of some enthusiasts and numerous ecclesiastical texts by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], there was almost no education in Mari language. After the [[October Revolution]], there was a period of support of all lesser national cultures in the [[Soviet Union]], but eventually [[Russification]] returned. While the development of Mari literary language continued, still, only elementary-school education was available in Mari in the Soviet period, with this policy ending in village schools in the 1970–1980s. The period of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] in the 1990s opened opportunities for a revival of efforts expand the use of Mari in education and the public sphere. In the 1990s, the Mari language, alongside Russian, was proclaimed in the republican constitution to be an official language of Mari El. By the beginning of the 21st century, Mari language and literature was taught in 226 schools. At the History and Philology Department of the Mari State University and the [[Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya|Krupskaya]] Teachers' Training Institute (Yoshkar-Ola), more than half of the subjects are taught in Mari.

[[File:Mari language dialect map.svg|thumb|right|400px|The four main dialects of Mari.
{{legend|chocolate|Hill Mari}}
{{legend|#d7d700|North-Western Mari}}
{{legend|violet|Meadow Mari}}
{{legend|royalblue|Eastern Mari}}]]
The principal division between Mari varieties is the West and the East. According to the Soviet linguist Kovedyaeva (1976:9-15, 1993:163-164) the Mari macrolanguage is divided into four main dialects:
* [[Hill Mari]], spoken mainly on the right upper bank of the Volga River around  [[Kozmodemyansk]] (hence the name), but also on the left bank and in the mouth of [[Vetluga River|Vetluga]].
* ''North-Western Mari''
* [[Meadow Mari]], spoken on the left Volgan bank on the central and eastern plain ("meadow") of Mari El around the republican capital, [[Yoshkar-Ola]].
* ''Eastern Mari'' is scattered to the east of Mari El from [[Vyatka River|Vyatka]] through [[Kama River|Kama]] to [[Ufa River|Ufa]].
Each main dialect is divided into their own smaller local subdialects. Only Hill and Meadow Mari have their own literary written standard varieties, based on the dialects of Kozmodemyansk and Yoshkar-Ola respectively.

Eastern and Meadow Mari are often united as a Meadow-Eastern supra-dialect. North-Western Mari is transitional between the Hill and Meadow dialects, and its phonology and morphology are closer to Hill Mari.

# Only in Hill Mari
The schwa {{IPA|/ə/}} and its fronted counterpart are usually transcribed in [[Finno-Ugric transcription]] as ''ə̑'' (reduced mid unrounded vowel) and ''ə'' (reduced front unrounded vowel) respectively. The former has sometimes been transcribed in IPA as {{IPAslink|ɤ}}, but phonetically the vowel is most strongly distinguished by its short duration and reduced quality. Descriptions vary on the degree of backness and labialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Dennis|last=Estill|year=2012|title=Revising the Meadow Mari vocalism|journal=Linguistica Uralica|volume=XLVIII/3|url=http://www.kirj.ee/20975/?tpl=1061&amp;c_tpl=1064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid vowels {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/ø/}}, {{IPA|/o/}} have more reduced allophones {{IPA|[e̽]}}, {{IPA|[ø̽]}}, {{IPA|[o̽]}} at the end of a word.

==== Word prosody ====
Stress is not phonemic in Mari, but a dynamic stress system is exhibited phonetically, the stressed syllable being higher in pitch and amplitude and greater in length than an unstressed syllable. Generally, there is one prominent syllable per word and prominence may be found in any syllable of the word. Post- and prefixes behave as [[clitic]]s, i.e., they do not have their own stress. For example, пӧ́рт (''pört'', "house") гыч (''gəč'', "out of") ({{IPA|[ˈpørt ɣɤt͡ʃ]}}); or му́ро (''muro'', "song") дене (''dene'', "with") ({{IPA|[ˈmuro ðene]}}).

# Only in Russian loanwords, in Hill Mari also onomatopoeia and Chuvashian loanwords.
# Palatalisation is marked in different ways. A {{angle bracket|у}} following a palatalised consonant is written as {{angle bracket|ю}}, and {{angle bracket|а}} following a palatalised consonant is written as {{angle bracket|я}}. If the vowel following a palatalised consonant is an е or an и, palatalisation is not marked at all. In other cases, the [[soft sign]] ь is used to mark palatalisation.
# The modified Cyrillic letter for the velar nasal ({{IPA|ŋ}}) combines the Cyrillic letter {{angle bracket|Н н}} with and {{angle bracket|Г г}}, where the rightmost post of Н is conflated with the vertical post of {{angle bracket|Г}}: {{angle bracket|Ҥ, ҥ}}. Although Hill Mari has this sound too, this character is only used in Meadow Mari.

=== Phonological processes ===

Like several other Uralic languages, Mari has [[vowel harmony]]. In addition to front/back harmony, Mari also features round/unround harmony. If the stressed vowel in the word is [[roundedness|rounded]], then the suffix will contain a rounded vowel: for example, кӱтӱ́ ([kyˈty] 'herd') becomes кӱтӱ́штӧ ([kyˈtyʃtø]], 'in the herd'); if the stressed vowel is unrounded, then the suffix will contain an unrounded vowel: ки́д ([kid], 'hand') becomes ки́дыште ([ˈkidəʃte], 'in the hand'). If the stressed vowel is back, then the suffix will end in a back vowel: агу́р ([aˈgur], 'whirlpool') becomes агу́рышто ([aˈgurəʃto], 'in the whirlpool'). &lt;ref&gt;Зорина, Крылова, Якимова 1990: 9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declension ==

Like other [[Uralic languages]], Mari is an [[agglutinating language]]. It lacks grammatical gender, and does not use articles.

=== Case ===
Meadow Mari has 9 [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] [[Declension|cases]], of which 3 are [[locative case]]s. The usage of the latter ones is restricted to inanimate objects.

Many cases, aside from their basic function, are used in other situations, such as in expressions of time.
* [[Nominative case|Nominative]], used for subjects, predicatives and for other grammatical functions.
* [[Genitive case|Genitive]], is used for possessive constructions.
* [[Dative case|Dative]], the indirect object's case.
* [[Accusative case|Accusative]], the direct object's case.
* [[Comitative case|Comitative]], used when a subject or an object can be split up into parts, or in adverbials expressing the involvement of an object in an action.
* [[Comparative case|Comparative]], used to express the likeness to something.
* [[Inessive case|Inessive]], used to state where something is.
* [[Illative case|Illative]], used to state where something is going.
* [[Lative case|Lative]], used to express into what something is going.

# The illative has a short form, equivalent to the long form in meaning.

If a locative statement was to be made about an animate object, postpositions would be used.

Additionally, terms denoting family members have [[Vocative case|vocative]] forms. These are, however, not created with a specific paradigm, and only exist in a few pre-defined cases.

Hill Mari has these cases, plus the [[abessive case]] (of the form -де), which is used to form [[adverbial]]s stating without the involvement or influence of which an action happens.

=== Number ===
Mari, though an agglutinative language, does not have a separate [[morpheme]] to signify [[plural]]ity. There are three particles, which are attached to the end of words with a hyphen, used to signify plural.
* -влак (''-vlak'') – Standard plural form.
* -шамыч (''-šamõč'') – Alternative standard plural, used in many dialects. There is no difference in meaning between these two
* -мыт (''mõt'') – Sociative plural. Used to signify a group of people: the members of a family, a person and his family and friends.

=== Possessive suffixes ===
Every grammatical person in Mari has its own [[possessive suffix]].

| -
| шӱргӧ (face)
|-

|-
| Second-person plural
| -да
| шӱргы'''да''' (your face)
|-
| Third-person singular
| -шт/ышт
| шӱргы'''шт''' (their face)
|}

=== Additional suffixes ===
Additional particles, falling into none of the categories above, can be added to the very end of a word, giving it some additional meaning. For example, the suffix -ат ''(-at''), means 'also' or 'too'.

=== Arrangement of suffixes ===
The arrangement of suffixes varies from case to case. Although the case suffixes are after the possessive suffixes in the genitive and the accusative, the opposite is the case for the locative cases. In the dative, both arrangements are possible.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Case
! Singular
! Example
! Plural
|-
| Nominative
| P
| пӧртем – 'my house (subject)'
| пӧртем-влак – 'my houses (subject)'
|-
| Genitive
| rowspan="3"| P → C
| пӧртемын – 'of my house'
| пӧртем-влакын – 'of my houses'
|-
| Accusative
| пӧртемым – 'my house (object)'
| пӧртем-влакым – 'my houses (object)'
|-
| Comitative
| пӧртемге – 'with my house'
| пӧртем-влакге – 'with my houses'
|-
| Dative
| P → C, C → P
| пӧртемлан, пӧртланем – 'to my houses'
| пӧртем-влаклан – 'to my houses'
|-
| Comparative
| P → C, C → P
| пӧртемла, пӧртлам – 'like my house'
| пӧртем-влакла – 'like my houses'
|-
| Inessive
| rowspan="3"| C → P
| пӧртыштем – 'in my house'
| пӧрт-влакыштем – 'in my houses'
|-
| Illative
| пӧртышкем – 'into my house'
| пӧрт-влакышкем – 'into my houses'
|-
| Lative
| пӧртешем – 'into my house'
| пӧрт-влакешем – 'into my houses'
|-
|}

There are many other arrangements in the plural—the position of the plural particle is flexible. The arrangement here is one commonly used possibility.

=== Comparison ===
[[Comparison (grammar)|Comparison]] happens with adjectives and adverbs. The [[comparative]] is formed with the suffix -рак (-rak). The [[superlative]] is formed by adding the word эн (en) in front.

== Conjugation ==
Morphologically, [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] follows three [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] and three [[Grammatical moods|moods]] in Meadow Mari.

=== Conjugation types ===
In Meadow Mari, words can conjugate according to two conjugation types. These differ from each other in all forms but the infinitive and the third-person plural of the imperative. Unfortunately, the infinitive is the form denoted in dictionaries and word lists. It is, thus, necessary to either mark verb infinitives by their conjugation type in word lists, or to include a form in which the conjugation type is visible—usually, the first-person singular present, which ends in -ам (or -ям) for verbs in the first declination, and in -ем (or -эм) for second-declination verbs.

=== Tense ===
The three tenses of Mari verbs are:
* [[Present tense|Present]]

The present tense is used for present and future actions, for states of being and for habitual actions, among others.
* First [[preterite]]

The first preterite is used to express observed, recent actions.
* Second preterite

The second preterite is used for actions that are in the more-distant past.

Additional tenses can be formed through [[periphrasis]].
* First periphrastic [[imperfect]]
* Second periphrastic imperfect
* First periphrastic [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]
* Second periphrastic perfect

=== Mood ===
The moods are:
* [[Indicative mood|Indicative]]

The indicative is used to express facts and positive beliefs. All intentions that a particular language does not categorize as another mood are classified as indicative. It can be formed in all persons, in all times.
* [[Imperative mood|Imperative]]

The imperative expresses direct commands, requests, and prohibitions. It only exists in the present tense, and exists in all persons but the first person singular.
* [[Desiderative mood|Desiderative]]

The desiderative is used to express desires. It can be formed for all persons, in the present tense and in the two periphrastic imperfect.

=== Negation ===
Negation in Mari uses a 'negative verb', much like [[Finnish language|Finnish]] does. The negative verb is more versatile than the negative verb in Finnish (see [[Finnish grammar]]), existing in more grammatical tenses and moods. It has its own form in the present indicative, imperative and desiderative, and in the first preterite indicative. Other negations are periphrastic.

The negation verb in its corresponding form is put in front of the negated verb in its second-person singular (the stem-only form), much as it is in Finnish and [[Estonian language|Estonian]].

# Bold letters are subject to vowel harmony—they can be ''е/о/ӧ'', depending on the preceding full vowel.
# First-conjugation verb forms using the imperative second-person singular as their stem are subject to the same stem changes as the imperative.
# In the first conjugation, the imperative second-person singular is formed by removing the ''-аш'' ending from the infinitive. Four consonant combinations are not allowed at the end of an imperative, and are thus simplified—one consonant is lost. &lt;br&gt; ''кт'' → ''к'', ''нч'' → ''ч'', ''чк'' → ''ч'', ''шк'' → ''ш''

The '''Mlabri''' ([[wikt:มลาบรี|มลาบรี]]) or '''Mrabri''' are an ethnic group of [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]], and have been called "the most interesting and least understood people in Southeast Asia".&lt;ref&gt;Schliesinger, Joachim, ''Ethnic Groups of Laos, vol. 2'', {{ISBN|974-480-036-4}}, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Only about 400 or fewer Mlabris remain in the world today, with some estimates as low as 100. A hill tribe in northern [[Thailand]] along the border with [[Laos]], they have been groups of nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]s.  Those in Thailand live close to the Hmong and northern Thai. Those living in Laos live close to other ethnic groups.

==Nomenclature==
The name ''Mlabri'' is a Thai/Lao alteration of the word ''Mrabri'', which appears to come from a Khmuic term "people of the forest". In [[Khmu language|Khmu]], ''mra'' means "person" and ''bri'' "forest". They are also known locally as ''Phi Tong Luang'' (Thai: ผีตองเหลือง, Lao: ຜີຕອງເຫລືອງ) or "spirits of the yellow leaves", since they abandon their shelters when the leaves begin to turn yellow.

==Genetics==
Genetic analysis of the Mlabri group by Hiroki Oota and colleagues led them to believe that their [[mtDNA]] has little diversity, suggesting the Mlabris originated 500 to 800 years ago from very few individuals.&lt;!--What ethnic affinity is shown from the DNA?--&gt; However, this was contested in the journal [[PLoS Biology]] in 2005 in an exchange of articles between Hiroki Oota and his colleagues and Tony Waters.

==Lifestyle==
The Mlabri traditionally lived a nomadic lifestyle. They moved frequently, and had no permanent houses, instead making temporary shelters from palm leaves and bamboo-string. They wore only a loin-covering of bark or cloth, though most Mlabri now wear factory-made clothes gained by trade with other hill tribes. They are hunter-gatherers, with most of their food coming from gathering. Women give birth alone in the forest and infant mortality used to be very high.

The Mlabri have few regimented social ceremonies, and are said to have no formal religious system, though they believe in forest spirits and other nature spirit. Marriages are made with simple request; there is no bride-price. The dead are buried near where they expired, and the tribe moves on.

In 1938, Austrian anthropologist [[Hugo Bernatzik]] published an ethnography of the "Yellow Leaf People" which contained his brief observations of the tribe in the early 20th century.

Since the 1990s, the Mlabri in Thailand have settled into more permanent villages in [[Phrae]] and [[Nan Province|Nan]] provinces. The houses they live in are made of cinderblock and wood, with metal roofs and even electricity.  Mlabri children have started going to public schools, and their health care has improved.[https://www.academia.edu/33433584/The_Demographics_of_a_Village_of_Recently_Settled_Hunter-_Gatherers_in_Thailand] It was reported in 2013 that the Mlabri's suicide rate has risen.&lt;ref&gt;Long, Mary, Eugene Long, and Tony Waters (2013) "Suicide Among the Mla Bri Hunter-Gatherers of Northern Thailand."  ''Journal of the Siam Society'' (v. 101).  [https://www.academia.edu/4777783/Suicide_Among_the_Mla_Bri_Hunter-Gatherers_of_Northern_Thailand_by_Mary_Long_Eugene_Long_and_Tony_Waters]&lt;/ref&gt; Mlabri villages have some economic activity. While still hunting and gathering, the Mlabri now engage in highland farming and hammock weaving, besides working as day laborers.

One of the Mlabri settlements in Nan Province is under the patronage of HRH Princess [[Sirindhorn]].

The game is played with a long arrow (''ghashay'') and a long bow (''leenda''). The arrow has a saucer shaped metallic plate (''tubray'') at its distal end. The archers play in teams and attempt to hit a small white wooden target called ''takai'' surrounded by a circular ring called ''kwaara''. The target is secured in fresh clay placed at some height a few meters away from the [[archery|archer]].

|title=Murder of Evelyn Okubo
|location=[[Chicago, Illinois]], U.S.
|date=July 18, 1970
|convicted=Nobody
|}}

'''Evelyn Okubo''' was a Japanese-American [[sansei]] teenager killed during the 1970 convention of the [[Japanese American Citizens League]] (JACL) at the [[Palmer House Hilton|Palmer House hotel]] in [[Chicago]]. Her 17-year-old roommate, Ranko Carol Yamada, was also severely wounded, yet survived. The murder caused a significant stir within the Japanese-American community, in part because Yamada alleged that the killer was black, just at the height of violence associated with the [[Black Panther Party]].&lt;ref name="Harden"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harden|first1=Jacelyn|title=Double Cross: Japanese Americans in Black and White Chicago|date=2003|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=9781452905969|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q8rm39-3rXcC|accessdate=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killer was never found.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Evelyn Okubo was 18 years old and hailed from the Japanese community of [[Stockton, California]].&lt;ref name="yellow"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nokubo, Miyamoto|authorlink1=Asian Song|editor1-last=Ling|editor1-first=Amy|title=Yellow Light: The Flowering of Asian American Arts|date=1999|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781566398176|chapter=Images, the Spoken Word, Dance, and Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and Ranko Carol Yamada had traveled to Chicago as representatives of the Japanese-American youth organization Yellow Seed to the national convention of the JACL, which was then focused on fighting for racial justice and against the war in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=yellow/&gt; Prior to the murder, Okubo was believed to have attended racial issue discussion meetings with groups like the Black Panthers and the [[Young Lords]], a Latino community organization with roots as a Chicago turf gang.&lt;ref&gt; Harden, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murder ==

On July 17th, 1970, Okubo was murdered, and Yamada was slashed in the throat, in room 725 of the Palmer House hotel.&lt;ref name =Court&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Carol Ranko Yamada and Mabel Okubo|opinion=YAMADA v. HILTON HOTEL CORP. |court=Appellate Court of Illinois — First District (3rd Division). |date=1977-12-21 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/197716160illapp3d1011143 |accessdate=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yamada, though badly wounded, wrote out several messages: "Gory, but it doesn't really hurt," "He was a black man with a [[Afro|natural]]," and "Don't blame him it was not his fault. There must be absolute peace."&lt;ref name = Harden /&gt; When they were discovered about half an hour later by the third JACL attendee sharing the hotel room, both girls had been stripped naked and bound, though neither showed evidence of being raped.&lt;ref name = Court/&gt; Yamada couldn't speak for two weeks after the incident due to her throat injury, but eventually recounted that the attacker had pranced around naked before killing Okubo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bizarre Details Told About Chicago Slasher|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DS19700826.2.25|publisher=Desert Sun|date=1970-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Aftermath ==

Chicago newspapers originally ran sensational stories alleging that Okubo was raped prior to being murdered, and implied that interracial dating on the part of the youth activists was to blame.&lt;ref name = Harden /&gt; Meanwhile, two police officers were killed by sniper fire from a housing project that same day, while several police and Panthers had been killed the previous year, which added to the supposition that Okubo was killed by a Panther.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Koziol|first1=Ronald|title=Police Note Clews to Murder|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1970/07/18/page/1/article/snipers-slay-2-policemen|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=1970-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', police named a man named Lonell Robinson as a prime suspect after he was caught raping and robbing another woman in the same hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leeds|first1=Patricia|title=Suspect in Hotel Rape Held|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1970/12/01/page/58/article/suspect-in-hotel-rape-held|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=1970-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was later ruled out as a suspect, though in the rape case he was indeed convicted the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conrad Hilton Hotel Rapist Found Guilty|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1971/02/11/page/9/article/conrad-hilton-hotel-rapist-found-guilty/index.html|accessdate=2017-09-13|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=1971-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspapers also eventually acknowledged that no rape had been committed in Okubo's case, and though some columnists suspected that racial animus was a motive, this has never been confirmed as the perpetrator was never found.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Mabel Okubo, Evelyn's mother, and Carol Yamada later filed a civil suit against the Palmer House, alleging negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Carol Ranko Yamada and Mabel Okubo|opinion=YAMADA v. HILTON HOTEL CORP. |court=Appellate Court of Illinois — First District (3rd Division). |date=1977-12-21 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/197716160illapp3d1011143 |accessdate=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

The tragedy of Okubo's murder was the inspiration for Japanese-American songwriter and musician JoAnne Nobuko Miyamoto, another JACL attendee and ''[[West Side Story]]'' actress, to write her first song. She and fellow musician [[Chris Iijima]] began touring Japanese-American communities, advocating interracial reconciliation and activism while raising money to honor Okubo's memory. Ultimately, they would form the band Yellow Pearl (a pun on [[Yellow Peril]]) and become a touchstone in Asian-American media.&lt;ref name="Rafu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yamamoto|first1=J.K|title=STILL ONE OF THE SHARKS: NOBUKO MIYAMOTO LOOKS BACK AT ‘WEST SIDE STORY’ 50 YEARS LATER|url=http://www.rafu.com/2011/12/still-one-of-the-sharks-nobuko-miyamoto-looks-back-at-%E2%80%98west-side-story%E2%80%99-50-years-later/|website=The Rafu Shimpo|accessdate=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many older Japanese-Americans viewed the murder as confirming their suspicions about the dangers of interracial activism by young Japanese-Americans, and despite the fact that no evidence has been found to support the claim, the belief that the crime was committed by a Black Panther remains prevalent in parts of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Randolph Denard Ornette Coleman''' (March 9, 1930{{Dubious |Birth date redux|reason=Various sources give March 9 or March 19, 1930 or 1931 |date=March 2016}} – June 11, 2015)&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|last= Ratliff|first= Ben |title= Ornette Coleman, Saxophonist Who Rewrote the Language of Jazz, Dies at 85 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/arts/music/ornette-coleman-jazz-saxophonist-dies-at-85-obituary.html?_r=0|accessdate= March 27, 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[jazz]] saxophonist, violinist, trumpeter, and composer. In the 1960s, he was one of the founders of [[free jazz]], a term he invented for his album ''[[Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation]]''. His "[[Broadway Blues]]" has become a standard and has been cited as an important work in free jazz.&lt;ref name="HellmerLawn2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hellmer|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Lawn|first2=Richard|title=Jazz Theory and Practice: For Performers, Arrangers and Composers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjaITr2NdkEC&amp;pg=PA234|date=3 May 2005|publisher=Alfred Music|isbn=978-1-4574-1068-0|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; His album ''[[Sound Grammar]]'' received the 2007 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for music.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Coleman was born in 1930 in [[Fort Worth, Texas]],&lt;ref name=theguardian&gt;{{cite news|last= Fordham|first= John|title= Ornette Coleman obituary|url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/11/ornette-coleman|accessdate= March 27, 2017|newspaper =[[The Guardian]]|date=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was  raised.&lt;ref name="Atlantic 1972"&gt;{{cite news | title = Ornette Coleman and the Circle with a Hole in the Middle | work = [[The Atlantic Monthly]] | first = Robert | last = Palmer | date = December 1972 | quote = Ornette Coleman since March 19, 1930, when he was born in Fort Worth, Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EGP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jetson.unl.edu/cocoon/encyclopedia/doc/egp.afam.015 |title=Coleman, Ornette (b. 1930) |publisher=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains |editor=Wishart, David J. |accessdate=March 26, 2012 |quote=Ornette Coleman, born in Fort Worth, Texas, on March 19, 1930. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707184611/http://jetson.unl.edu/cocoon/encyclopedia/doc/egp.afam.015 |archivedate=July 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="litweiler21"&gt;Litweiler, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; His sister, Truvenza Coleman claims that he was born on March 9, 1931.&lt;ref name="litweiler21" /&gt; He attended [[I.M. Terrell High School]], where he participated in band until he was dismissed for improvising during "[[The Washington Post (march)|The Washington Post]]" march.&lt;ref&gt;Litweiler, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He began performing [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] and [[bebop]] on tenor saxophone and started The Jam Jivers with [[Prince Lasha]] and [[Charles Moffett]].&lt;ref&gt;Litweiler, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Eager to leave town, he accepted a job in 1949 with a [[Silas Green from New Orleans]] traveling show and then with touring rhythm and blues shows. After a show in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he was assaulted and his saxophone was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Spellman, A. B.| title=Four Lives in the Bebop Business| publisher=Limelight| year=1985 | origyear=1966|pages=98–101| isbn=0-87910-042-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He switched to alto saxophone, which remained his primary instrument, first playing it in New Orleans after the Baton Rouge incident. He then joined the band of [[Pee Wee Crayton]] and traveled with them to Los Angeles. He worked at various jobs, including as an elevator operator, while pursuing his music career.

In California he found like-minded musicians such as [[Ed Blackwell]], [[Bobby Bradford]], [[Don Cherry (trumpeter)|Don Cherry]], [[Charlie Haden]], [[Billy Higgins]], and [[Charles Moffett]].&lt;ref name="Yanow"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yanow |first1=Scott |title=Ornette Coleman |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ornette-coleman-mn0000484396/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EJN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ornette Coleman biography on Europe Jazz Network |url=http://www.europejazz.net/mus/coleman.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050502160154/http://www.europejazz.net/mus/coleman.htm |archivedate=May 2, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He recorded his debut album, ''[[Something Else!!!!]]'' (1958) with Cherry, Higgins, [[Walter Norris]], and [[Don Payne (musician)|Don Payne]].&lt;ref name="Jurek"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jurek |first1=Thom |title=Something Else: The Music of Ornette Coleman |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/something-else-the-music-of-ornette-coleman-mw0000198903 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year he belonged briefly to a quintet led by [[Paul Bley]] that performed at a club in New York City.&lt;ref name="Yanow" /&gt; By the time ''[[Tomorrow Is the Question!]]'' was recorded soon after with Cherry, Higgins, and Haden, the jazz world had been shaken up by Coleman's alien music. Some jazz musicians called him a fraud, while conductor Leonard Bernstein praised him.&lt;ref name="EJN" /&gt;

===1959: ''The Shape of Jazz to Come''===
In 1959 [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] released ''[[The Shape of Jazz to Come]]'' According to music critic Steve Huey, the album "was a watershed event in the genesis of avant-garde jazz, profoundly steering its future course and throwing down a gauntlet that some still haven't come to grips with."&lt;ref name="Huey"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Huey |first1=Steve |title=The Shape of Jazz to Come|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-shape-of-jazz-to-come-mw0000187968 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jazzwise]]'' listed it No. 3 on their list of the 100 best jazz albums of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/pages/jazz-album-reviews/11585-the-100-jazz-albums-that-shook-the-world|title=The 100 Jazz Albums That Shook The World|author=Mike Flynn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman's quartet received a lengthy – and sometimes controversial – engagement at New York City's famed [[Five Spot]] jazz club. Such notable figures as the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]], Leonard Bernstein and [[Lionel Hampton]] were favorably impressed, and offered encouragement. (Hampton was so impressed he reportedly asked to perform with the quartet; Bernstein later helped Haden obtain a composition grant from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]].) Opinion was, however, divided. Trumpeter [[Miles Davis]] famously declared Coleman was "all screwed up inside",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-why-was-ornette-coleman-so-important-jazz-masters-both-living-and-dead-chime-in-20150611-column.html | title=Why was Ornette Coleman so important? Jazz masters both living and dead chime in | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=June 11, 2015 | accessdate=June 17, 2015 | author=Roberts, Randall}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Davis recanted this comment and became a proponent of Coleman's innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6449431 | title=Ornette Coleman: Decades of Jazz on the Edge | publisher=[[NPR]].org | date=November 13, 2006 | accessdate=June 17, 2015 | author=[[Ashley Kahn|Kahn, Ashley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Eldridge]] stated, "I'd listened to him all kinds of ways. I listened to him high and I listened to him cold sober. I even played with him. I think he's jiving baby."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Coleman's unique early sound was due in part to his use of a [[Grafton saxophone|plastic saxophone]]. He had first bought a plastic horn in Los Angeles in 1954 because he was unable to afford a metal saxophone, though he didn't like the sound of the plastic instrument at first.&lt;ref&gt;Litweiler, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman later claimed that it sounded drier, without the pinging sound of metal. In later years, he played a metal saxophone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Ornette+Coleman |title=Ornette Coleman |accessdate=June 29, 2009 |publisher=Last.fm Ltd. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Atlantic recordings, Coleman's sidemen in the quartet are Cherry on cornet or [[pocket trumpet]], Haden, [[Scott LaFaro]], and then [[Jimmy Garrison]] on bass, and Higgins or his replacement [[Ed Blackwell]] on drums. The complete released recordings for the label were collected on the box set ''[[Beauty Is a Rare Thing]]''.&lt;ref name=ALLMUSIC&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p65603|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960: ''Free Jazz''===
In 1960, Coleman recorded ''[[Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation]]'', which featured a double quartet, including Don Cherry and [[Freddie Hubbard]] on trumpet, [[Eric Dolphy]] on bass clarinet, Haden and LaFaro on bass, and both Higgins and Blackwell on drums. The record was recorded in stereo, with a [[reed instrument|reed]]/[[brass instrument|brass]]/bass/drums quartet isolated in each stereo channel. ''Free Jazz'' was, at nearly 40 minutes, the lengthiest recorded continuous jazz performance to date, and was instantly one of Coleman's most controversial albums. The music features a regular but complex pulse, one drummer playing "straight" while the other played double-time; the thematic material is a series of brief, dissonant fanfares. As is conventional in jazz, there are a series of solo features for each member of the band, but the other soloists are free to chime in as they wish, producing some extraordinary passages of collective improvisation by the full octet. In the January 18, 1962 issue of ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine, in a special review titled "Double View of a Double Quartet," Pete Welding awarded the album Five Stars while John A. Tynan rated it No Stars.&lt;ref&gt;''Down Beat'': January 18, 1962, vol. 29, no. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman intended "free jazz" as simply an album title, but his growing reputation placed him at the forefront of jazz innovation, and [[free jazz]] was soon considered a new genre, though Coleman has expressed discomfort with the term. Among the reasons Coleman may not have entirely approved of the term 'free jazz' is that his music contains a considerable amount of [[musical composition|composition]]. His melodic material, although skeletal, strongly recalls the melodies that [[Charlie Parker]] wrote over [[jazz standard|standard]] harmonies, and in general the music is closer to the bebop that came before it than is sometimes popularly imagined.&lt;ref name="Reich2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Howard Reich|title=Let Freedom Swing: Collected Writings on Jazz, Blues, and Gospel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z6hAiX1i5jEC&amp;pg=PA333|date=30 September 2010|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=978-0-8101-2705-0|pages=333–}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Several early tunes of his, for instance, are clearly based on favorite bop chord changes like "[[Out of Nowhere (Johnny Green song)|Out of Nowhere]]" and "[[I Got Rhythm]]".) Coleman very rarely played standards, concentrating on his own compositions, of which there seemed to be an endless flow. There are exceptions, though, including a classic reading (virtually a recomposition) of "[[Embraceable You]]" for Atlantic, and an improvisation on [[Thelonious Monk]]'s "[[Criss-Cross (album)|Criss-Cross]]" recorded with [[Gunther Schuller]].

===1960s–70s: Avant-garde and harmolodic funk===
[[File:Ornette Coleman-140911-0002-96WP.jpg|thumb|upright|Coleman in 1971]]
After the Atlantic period and into the early part of the 1970s, Coleman's music became more angular and engaged fully with the jazz [[avant-garde]] which had developed in part around his innovations.&lt;ref name="ALLMUSIC" /&gt;

His quartet dissolved, and Coleman formed a new trio with [[David Izenzon]] on bass, and [[Charles Moffett]] on drums. Coleman began to extend the sound-range of his music, introducing accompanying string players (though far from the territory of ''[[Charlie Parker with Strings]]'') and playing trumpet and violin (which he played left-handed) himself. He initially had little conventional musical technique and used the instruments to make large, unrestrained gestures. His friendship with [[Albert Ayler]] influenced his development on trumpet and violin. Haden would later sometimes join this trio to form a two-bass quartet.

Between 1965 and 1967 Coleman signed with [[Blue Note Records]] and released a number of recordings starting with the influential recordings of the trio ''[[At the Golden Circle Stockholm]]''.&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Freeman |first1=Phil |title=Good Old Days: Ornette Coleman On Blue Note|url=http://www.bluenote.com/spotlight/good-old-days-ornette-coleman-on-blue-note |website=Blue Note Records |accessdate=14 August 2018 |date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Coleman recorded ''[[The Empty Foxhole]]'', with a trio featuring Haden and Coleman's son [[Denardo Coleman]] – who was ten years old. While some, like [[Shelly Manne]] and [[Freddie Hubbard]], regarded this as perhaps an ill-advised piece of publicity on Coleman's part and judged the move a mistake.,&lt;ref name="Gabel"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gabel |first1=J. C. |title=Making Knowledge Out of Sound |url=http://www.stopsmilingonline.com/twitter/SS-Ornette.pdf |website=stopsmilingonline.com |accessdate=14 August 2018 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spencer"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Spencer |first1=Robert |title=Ornette Coleman: The Empty Foxhole |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/the-empty-foxhole-ornette-coleman-blue-note-records-review-by-robert-spencer.php?width=1680 |website=All About Jazz |accessdate=14 August 2018 |date=1 April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; others{{who|date=August 2018}} noted that despite his youth, Denardo had studied drumming for several years and his technique – which, though unrefined, was respectable and enthusiastic – owed more to pulse-oriented free jazz drummers like [[Sunny Murray]] than to bebop drumming.&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt; Denardo became his father's primary drummer in the late 1970s.{{citation needed |date=August 2018}}

Coleman formed another quartet. Haden, Garrison, and [[Elvin Jones]] appeared, and [[Dewey Redman]] joined the group, usually on tenor saxophone. On February 29, 1968 in a group with Haden, [[Ed Blackwell]], and [[David Izenzon]] Coleman performed live with [[Yoko Ono]] at [[Albert Hall]]. One song was included on the album  ''[[Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band]]'' (1970)&lt;ref name="Chrispell"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chrispell |first1=James |title=Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/yoko-ono-plastic-ono-band-mw0000026229 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued to explore his interest in string textures – from ''[[Town Hall, 1962]]'', culminating with the ''[[Skies of America]]'' album in 1972. (Sometimes this had a practical value, as it facilitated his group's appearance in the UK in 1965, where jazz musicians were under a quota arrangement but classical performers were exempt.)

Coleman, like Miles Davis before him, took to playing with [[electric instrument|electrified instruments]].{{citation needed |date=March 2017}} The 1976 funk album ''[[Dancing in Your Head]]'', Coleman's first recording with the group which later became known as Prime Time, prominently featured electric guitars. While this marked a stylistic departure for Coleman, the music maintained certain similarities to his earlier work. These performances had the same angular melodies and simultaneous group improvisations – what [[Joe Zawinul]] referred to as "nobody solos, everybody solos" and what Coleman called ''[[harmolodics]]'' – and although the nature of the pulse was altered, Coleman's rhythmic approach did not.{{citation needed |date=August 2018}}

===1980s–90s===
{{see also|Of Human Feelings}}
[[File:Ornette at The Forum 1982.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Coleman performing in [[Toronto]] in 1982]]

In the 1980s, albums like ''[[Virgin Beauty]]'' and ''[[Of Human Feelings]]'' continued to use [[rock music|rock]] and [[funk music|funk]] rhythms, sometimes called [[free funk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TMZMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA146|title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience|first1=Anthony|last1=Appiah|first2=Laurance S.

Coleman joined the [[Grateful Dead]] on stage once in 1993 during "Space", and stayed for "The Other One", "Stella Blue",  [[Bobby Bland]]'s "Turn on Your Lovelight", and the encore "Brokedown Palace".&lt;ref name=Deadbase&gt;{{cite book |title=DeadBase XI: The Complete Guide to Grateful Dead Song Lists |last=Scott |first=John W. |author2=Dolgushkin, Mike |author3=Nixon, Stu. |year=1999 |publisher=DeadBase |location=Cornish, NH |isbn=1-877657-22-0 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/gd93-02-23.sbd.hall.1611.sbeok.shnf|title=Grateful Dead Live at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum on 1993-02-23|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another collaboration was with guitarist [[Pat Metheny]], with whom Coleman recorded ''[[Song X]]'' (1985); though released under Metheny's name, Coleman was essentially co-leader (contributing all the compositions).

In 1990, the city of [[Reggio Emilia]] in Italy held a three-day "Portrait of the Artist" featuring a Coleman quartet with Cherry, Haden and Higgins. The festival also presented performances of his chamber music and the symphonic ''Skies of America''.

In 1991, Coleman played on the soundtrack for [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]''; the orchestra was conducted by [[Howard Shore]]. It is notable among other things for including a rare sighting of Coleman playing a jazz standard: Thelonious Monk's blues line "Misterioso". Two 1972 (pre-electric) Coleman recordings, "Happy House" and "Foreigner in a Free Land" were used in [[Gus Van Sant]]'s 2000 ''[[Finding Forrester]]''.

The mid-1990s saw a flurry of activity from Coleman: he released four records in 1995 and 1996, and for the first time in many years worked regularly with piano players (either [[Geri Allen]] or [[Joachim Kühn]]).

===2000s===
[[Image:Ornette-Coleman-2008-Heidelberg-schindelbeck.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coleman at the Enjoy Jazz Festival, [[Heidelberg]], October 2008]]

In September 2006 he released a live album titled ''[[Sound Grammar]]'' with his newest quartet (Denardo drumming and two bassists, [[Greg Cohen|Gregory Cohen]] and Tony Falanga). This was his first album of new material in ten years, and was recorded in Germany in 2005. It won the 2007 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for music, Coleman being only the second jazz artist to win the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Custom byline text:&amp;nbsp; johnbynorth |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/pulitzer-prize-winning-jazz-visionary-ornette-coleman-dies-aged-85-x.128767327 |title=Pulitzer Prize winning jazz visionary Ornette Coleman dies aged 85 |publisher=''Herald Scotland'' |date= |accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jazz pianist [[Joanne Brackeen]] (who had only briefly studied music as a child) stated in an interview with [[Marian McPartland]] that Coleman had been mentoring her and giving her semi-formal music lessons in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101558445 |title=Joanne Brackeen on Piano Jazz |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman continued to push himself into unusual playing situations, often with much younger musicians or musicians from radically different musical cultures. An increasing number of his compositions, while not ubiquitous, have become minor jazz standards, including "[[Lonely Woman (composition)|Lonely Woman]]", "Peace", "Turnaround", "When Will the Blues Leave?", "The Blessing", "Law Years", "What Reason Could I Give" and "I've Waited All My Life". He has influenced virtually every saxophonist of a modern disposition, and nearly every such jazz musician, of the generation that followed him. His songs have proven endlessly malleable: pianists such as Paul Bley and [[Paul Plimley]] have managed to turn them to their purposes; [[John Zorn]] recorded ''[[Spy vs Spy (album)|Spy vs Spy]]'' (1989), an album of extremely loud, fast, and abrupt versions of Coleman songs. Finnish jazz singer [[Carola Standertskjöld|Carola]] covered Coleman's "Lonely Woman" and there have even been [[progressive bluegrass]] versions of Coleman tunes (by [[Richard Greene (fiddle player)|Richard Greene]]).

'''Pashtun diaspora''' refers to ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] who live outside their traditional homeland of [[Pashtunistan]], which is south of the [[Amu Darya|Amu River]] in [[Afghanistan]] and west of the [[Indus River]] in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/445546/Pashtun |title=Pashtun |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pashtunistan is home to the majority of the Pashtun community. However, there are significant Pashtun diaspora communities in the [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] provinces of [[Pakistan]], in particular in the cities of [[Karachi]] and [[Lahore]]. A recent Pashtun diaspora has also developed in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], primarily in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Smaller populations of Pashtuns are found in the [[European Union]], [[North America]], [[Australia]] and other parts of the world. They may also be found in [[Iran]], [[Oman]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]] and [[Bahrain]]. In [[Northern India]], there are communities of Indians who trace their origins to the traditional Pashtun homeland.

The Pashtun [[ethnic group]] are believed to have settled in the vast Pashtunistan region in the [[first millennium]] C.E.&lt;ref name="Habibi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/Afghan_and_Afghanistan.htm |title=Afghan and Afghanistan |work=[[Abdul Hai Habibi]]|publisher=alamahabibi.com|year=1969|accessdate=24 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferishta"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=06901021&amp;ct=10|title=''History of the Mohamedan Power in India''|author=[[Firishta|Muhammad Qasim Hindu Shah]] (Firishta)|publisher=[[Packard Humanities Institute]]|work=Persian Literature in Translation|accessdate=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ethnologue]], they currently number around 50 million,&lt;ref name=Ethnologue/&gt; but some sources give slightly lower or higher figures.&lt;ref name="Penzl"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Pashto a Descriptive Study of the Dialect of Kandahar, Afghanistan

Smaller Pashtun communities outside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa can be found in the districts of [[Attock District|Attock]] and [[Mianwali District|Mianwali]] in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. These and other communities of Pashtun ancestry are often referred to as the [[Punjabi Pashtun]]. There are also large communities of Punjabi-Pashtuns Such as [[Niazi]] and others lives in [[Khanewal]], [[Kasur]], and other larger communities have settled around [[Multan]] which was formerly part of the [[Durrani Empire]]. Pathan community lives in different district of [[Azad Kashmir]]. Mainly they are being settled in districts of [[Poonch]], [[Sudhnuti]] and [[Bagh District|Bagh]]. In [[Poonch]] and [[Sudhnuti]] they constitute more than 70% population of district. [[Kashmiri Pashtuns]] mainly consists of [[Sadozai (Pastun tribe)|Sadozai]] tribe which are locally known as [[Sudhan]]. Approximate population of [[Sadozai (Pastun tribe)|Sadozai]]s in [[Azad Jammu and Kashmir|AJK]] is 1 million. [[Sadozai (Pastun tribe)|Sadozai]] tribe has a strong hold in [[Rawalakot]] city in [[Azad Kashmir]]. Small no of other pashtun tribes in [[Kashmir]] which include [[Durrani]], [[Tareen]], [[Lodhi]], [[Yousafzai]] [[Shinwari (Pashtun tribe)|Shinwary]] and [[Afridi]] tribes which extends from [[Azad Kashmir]] to India's [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]].  They speak local languages.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In addition to this, some [[Urdu language|Urdu]]-speaking communities in Pakistan trace their ancestry to the ancient Pashtun regions of Afghanistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhawa.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Some identify themselves as [[Bangash]], [[Yousefzai]], [[Ghurids|Ghouri]] and [[Durrani]]. Additionally, a significant number of descendants of [[Rohilla]]s migrated to Pakistan after the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.The [[Rohilla]] [[Pushtuns]] make up 30-30% of the [[Muhajir community]] in [[Karachi]].

[[British Raj|India]], as a British colony, once had a large Pashtun population roughly equal to that of Afghanistan, mostly concentrated in what were then the British Indian provinces of the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]] and [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]]. In Rohilkhand, they made large settlements subsequent to 14th century and prior to the 20th century. In fact, according to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the number of Pashtuns in all of India was nearly 31 million, but the speakers of Pashto numbered less than 14 million.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/PAS_PER/PATHAN.html|title=Pathan|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this population was allotted, along with its respective provinces, to Pakistan after the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] in 1947. Today the Pashtuns in India can be divided into those who speak Pashto and those who speak [[Urdu]]/[[Hindi]] and other regional languages, the Urdu/Hindi speaking group being the biggest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-pathans-to-broker-peace-in-afghanistan/article1-357245.aspx|title=Indian Pathans to broker peace in Afghanistan|work=Hindustan Times|date=11 December 2008|accessdate=3 May 2015|first=Shams-ur-Rehman|last=Alvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pashto-speaking communities ===

There are a large number of Pashto-speaking Pakhtuns in the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/web1/05aug13/news.htm|title=Special focus on Gujjars, Paharis: CM|publisher=[[Daily Excelsior]]|accessdate=2009-08-22}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although their exact numbers are hard to determine, it is at least in excess of 100,000 for it is known that in 1954 over 100,000 nomadic Pakhtuns living in Kashmir Valley were granted Indian

The [[Afridi]]s and the Machipurians, who belong to the [[Yusufzai]] tribe, are liable to military service, in return for which they hold certain villages free of revenue.

A further small, scattered Pashtun population still exists in some major cities of India with large Muslim populations, with the majority of [[Pashto language|Pashto]]-speaking individuals residing in the states of [[Delhi]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] India; who also have adopted local languages of the respective areas they live in, as their second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isamasih-lucknow.org/3.html|title=Pathan|publisher=Isa-Masih in Lucknow|accessdate=2007-02-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613024309/http://www.isamasih-lucknow.org/3.html|archivedate=13 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.4dw.net/royalark/India/rampur.htm|title=Rampur|publisher=Christopher Buyers|accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Pathans, numbering around 14,161,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crulp.org/Publication%5CCrulp_report%5CCR03_15E.pdf|format=PDF|title=Phonemic Inventory of Pashto|publisher=CRULP|accessdate=2007-06-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070723120307/http://crulp.org/Publication/Crulp_report/CR03_15E.pdf|archivedate=23 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement1.htm Abstract of speakers’ strength of languages and mother tongues – 2001], ''Census of India'' (retrieved 17 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; have retained the use of the Pashto language and are still able to speak and understand it.

=== Urdu and Hindi speaking communities ===

{{See also|Muhajir people}}
The larger number of people claiming Pashtun ancestry in Pakistan and India are Urdu speaking. Despite the loss of most of the [[British Raj|Raj]]-era Pashtun population, India still has a large community of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] speakers who trace their ancestry to ancient Pashtun settlers. They are often referred by the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] pronunciation of the word Pashtun, "Pathan".

Major Indian Pathan tribes lived in the following areas. While many persons belonging to these tribes moved to the Afghan-Pakistan border, others chose to stay and thus, descendants of these tribes still reside in the parts of India listed below:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.khyber.org/publications/pdf/pashtolangformation.pdf|title=Pashto Language &amp; Identity Formation|publisher=Contemporary South Asia, July 1995, Vol 4, Issue 2, p151,20 (Khyber)|accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is significant to note that a large part of above Pathan diaspora have naturalized themselves in the local culture over the centuries.

The term "Pathan" does not refer exclusively and specifically to these Indian Pashtun descendants. Historically the term was used mainly to refer to Pashtuns in general by mainstream Indians Muslims included. Most Pashtuns, however, find the term to be insensitive and prefer to be called by their native label.

=== Indians of Pashtun ancestry ===

Many Pashtuns worked in the [[Indian independence movement]]. While many supported the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]'s demand for Pakistan, some Pashtuns opposed it in favor of a united and secular India, especially members of the Indian National Congress. These included [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]], his son [[Khan Wali Khan]], Indian diplomat [[Mohammad Yunus (diplomat)|Mohammed Yunus]], Pakistani opposition leader [[Mufti Mahmud]] and Balochistan-based Pashtun leader [[Abdul Samad Achakzai]].
Also among the Pashtuns in India are students from [[Afghanistan]] who are in India to obtain a quality education, including [[President of Afghanistan]] [[Hamid Karzai]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/india-news/afghan-students-have-special-attraction-towards-himachal-university_10014934.html|title=Afghan students have special attraction towards Himachal University|publisher=Indians in Thailand|accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kabuliwallah Pashtuns who are doing business in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2005/10/24/stories/2005102401040200.htm|title=The Kabuliwallahs of Ballimaran|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=2007-06-07|location=Chennai, India|date=24 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, India has a large number of Hindu and Sikh refugees from Afghanistan who are fluent in [[Pashto language|Pashto]], and [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/hrfeatures/HRF04.htm|title=No Place to Turn: Afghan Refugees in New Delhi|publisher=[[Human Rights Documentation Centre]]|accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pashtuns concentrate in regions with large Afghan and Pakistani communities. There are regions in southern Ontario with a large Pashtun diaspora of Pakistani nationality, living Afghan communities with Dari speakers instead of Pashto speakers, causing a large polarization of the word "Afghan", especially irridentist disputes claiming Pakistani Pashtun communities as Afghan nationals.

Numerous amounts of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] refugees from [[Pakistan]] resettled into [[East Pakistan]] (today known as [[Bangladesh]]) after the 1947 British Petition, with additional migrants moving in after the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] as well, usually to escape the persecution of ethnic Afghans in Pakistan by the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Balbo |first1=Marcello |title=International Migrants and the City: Bangkok, Berlin, Dakar, Karachi, Johannesburg, Naples, São Paulo, Tijuana, Vancouver, Vladivostok |date=2005 |publisher=UN-HABITAT |isbn=9789211317473 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCet48XFuJQC&amp;pg=PT83&amp;lpg=PT83&amp;dq=stranded+pashtuns+in+bangladesh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4nvEaKxtXw&amp;sig=dTZDSGfcSyU_n_cWVN2Tu0t1EU0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiyu9OayO3cAhUGGKwKHZ9-C5AQ6AEwDnoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=stranded%20pashtuns%20in%20bangladesh&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Pashtuns]] in [[Bangladesh]] are descendants of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] emigrants who settled into [[Bangladesh]] during the [[Pathan]] rule of the [[Bengal Sultanate]] under the [[Karrani dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eaton |first1=Richard M. |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760 |date=1996 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520205079 |url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=gKhChF3yAOUC |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] communities of South Asia are also the [[Pathans of Sri Lanka]], who are believed to have origins from [[Pathans]] who settled in [[Batticaloa]], initially arriving for trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Essed |first1=Philomena |last2=Frerks |first2=Georg |last3=Schrijvers |first3=Joke |title=Refugees and the Transformation of Societies: Agency, Policies, Ethics, and Politics |date=2004 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=9781571818669 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ixn_D2mhxyAC&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1900s there have been many generations of Pashtuns who migrated from Afghanistan, Pakistan and the tribal areas of Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). Pashtun settlements in [[Thailand]] have been common throughout the provinces. There is even a Thai-Pashtun Friendship Association. The Pashtuns are fiercely independent, as a result they often are well treated and respected by the Thai locals. Countries like [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]] and [[Malaysia]] also have similar cases of Pashtun settlements, which those who are of descent are quickly assimilated to the local [[Non-Resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indian]] ethnic minority community while those recent migrants or settlers belong to the [[Pakistani diaspora]], since most of the migrants came from [[Pakistan]].

=== East Asia ===
There may be some Pashtun communities living in parts of [[China]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Japan]].

=== Guyana and Suriname ===

Some people living in [[Guyana]] and [[Suriname]] claim to be of Afghan descent. Most of them moved to South American countries during the [[India]]n immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afghanland.com/culture/guyana.html|title=Afghans of Guyana|work=Wahid Momand|publisher=Afghanland.com|year=2000|accessdate=2007-01-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105072533/http://afghanland.com/culture/guyana.html|archive-date=5 November 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Pashtuns from Afghanistan came to [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Panama]], [[Colombia]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Peru]] as refugees during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1981 and during the internal Afghan conflicts in 1995–1996.

'''Rama Cay Creole''' is a [[Creole language]] spoken by some 800 to 900 people on the island of [[Rama Cay]] in eastern [[Nicaragua]]. It is based on [[Miskito Coast Creole]] with additional elements of the Chibchan language [[Rama language|Rama]] and purportedly some elements of English spoken with a [[German language|German]] accent. The creolization of the language is supposed to have happened when Moravian missionaries who were native Germans but preached in English encouraged the Rama-speaking population of the island to shift to English.

===From 1990 to 1999===
* 1994 - In [[Canada]], economist Rodney Schmidt's research, beginning in the spring of 1994, "came about because [[Finance Minister (Canada)|Finance Minister]] [[Paul Martin]] himself had expressed an interest in the [[Tobin tax]] and the possibility of raising it at the June, 1995 [[G7|Group of 7]] meeting in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]]."&lt;ref name="cult"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/44/101.html |title= The Cult of impotence; Making Sure the Rich Stay Rich|author=[[Linda McQuaig]] |date= March 22, 1998|work= |publisher= [[Toronto Star]]; republished by Hartford Web Publishing  |accessdate=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This was before the December, [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico]].)
* 1994 - "[[Lloyd Bentsen]], who was at the time [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], was supportive ... he began raising the subject informally at the regular meetings of G7 finance ministers".&lt;ref name="cult"/&gt;
*In 1996, in [[New Zealand]], [[Don Brash]], when he was the Governor of the Reserve Bank, stated that a Tobin tax in New Zealand would not have the desired effect of reducing the volume of international financial transactions or in reducing market volatility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/speeches/0032358.html|title=New Zealand and international financial markets: have we lost control of our own destiny?|last=Brash|first=Donald T.|date=1996-06-29|publisher=Reserve Bank of New Zealand|accessdate=2008-10-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017184335/http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/speeches/0032358.html|archivedate=2008-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(According to Cliff Kincaid, Castro advocated it "specifically in order to generate U.S. financial reparations to the rest of the world," however a closer reading of Castro's speech shows that he never did mention "the rest of the world" as being recipients of revenue.)

===1990 to 1999===

* June 16, 1995, [[Paul Bernd Spahn]] opposed the original form of the Tobin tax and proposed his own variation (see [[Spahn tax]]).
* On August 1, 1995, an IMF Working Paper No. 95/77 ''Financial Transactions Taxes'' by Shome,Parthasrathi and Stotsky, Janet Gale found that "the economic effects of financial transactions taxes on capital markets are seen to be pervasive. They may impose significant efficiency costs by impairing the smooth functioning of financial markets, increasing the cost of capital, and distorting the structure of capital financing. Their effects on the volatility of capital flows, either in domestic or international financial markets, are uncertain, as are their distributional and revenue effects."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=1353.0&lt;/ref&gt;

[[War on Want]] also sets up the Tobin Tax Network to develop the proposal and press for its introduction.
* 2001 - [[The Guardian]] wrote that Tobin Tax would make everyone poorer. The liquidity on the currency market would decrease, the prices would become more volatile and transporting goods would become more difficult and expensive. According to The Guardian, [[speculant]]s are needed to risk their money so that liquidity would be better.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/aug/30/11 Jospin in fantasy land over Tobin tax - Silly distraction is unenforceable], [[The Guardian]], Thursday 30 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

It is true that it may discourage currency speculation but it would also reduce the liquidity of the marketplace."
* In 2001, the [[International Monetary Fund]] conducted considerable research that opposes a transaction tax. In 2001, findings by Habermeier, Karl Friedrich, and Andrei Kirilenko, state that "transaction taxes or such equivalents as capital controls can have negative effects on [[price discovery]], [[volatility (finance)|volatility]], and liquidity and lead to a reduction in the informational efficiency of markets."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=4068.0&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Tobin tax#2010|IMF position of 2010]], below)

===2009===

*In August, 2009, [[Adair Turner]], chair of the [[United Kingdom]] [[Financial Services Authority]], in an interview for [[Prospect magazine]] supported the idea of new global taxes on financial transactions, warning that a “swollen” financial sector paying excessive salaries has grown too big for society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8e68678a-ccba-11de-8e30-00144feabdc0.html |title= Q &amp; A on Tobin tax

*In late November 2009 [[Paul Krugman]], ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist and professor of Economics and International Affairs at [[Princeton University]], argued that a Tobin Tax would have ameliorated the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]]. He wrote, "bad investments aren’t the whole story of the crisis. What turned those bad investments into catastrophe was the financial system’s excessive reliance on short-term money ... a financial transactions tax, by discouraging reliance on ultra-short-run financing, would have made such a run much less likely. So contrary to what the skeptics say, such a tax would have helped prevent the current crisis — and could help us avoid a future replay." Krugman wrote that it is "an idea whose time has come."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/27/opinion/27krugman.html |title= Taxing the Speculators|author=[[Paul Krugman]] |date=November 26, 2009 |work= |publisher= [[New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In late November 2009, Economist [[Charles Goodhart]], Professor Emeritus of Banking and Finance at [[London School of Economics]] and developer of [[Goodhart's law]], was scathing in his criticism of "radical and consumer groups [that] go on backing the Tobin tax idea".  He argued, "Many of those who support such a tax neither know, nor care, what effects it might have on market efficiency.  Besides a, generally misguided view that its imposition would fall primarily on the financial sector, rather than be passed on to its customers, the hope is that such a tax would produce lots of lovely revenue, to be spent on good deeds, such as foreign aid." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurointelligence.com/article.581+M5e37ae11260.0.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* December 7, 2009, economist Stephany Griffith-Jones advocated a very low but "internationally co-ordinated tax on financial transactions, often described as a Tobin tax."&lt;ref name="Stephany"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/07/tobin-tax-climate-change-investment |title=Now let's tax transactions |author=Stephany Griffith-Jones |date=December 7, 2009 |work= |publisher= [[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010===

*February 15, 2010 - The [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] Business Advisory Council, wrote to the IMF opposing a global transaction tax.  The Council wrote:
{{quote|(The) imposition of a global tax is an inappropriate response and a further burden to industries, especially small and medium enterprises, and consumers in the wake of the global financial crisis.

*31 March 2010 - "350 economists, including [[Jeffrey Sachs]] and the Nobel laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]], from more than 35 countries signed a letter to the leaders of the Group of 20 countries calling on them to impose a tax on financial transactions between financial institutions, but not on transactions conducted by individuals."&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/tax-the-banks-and-give-to-the-poor-robin-hood-style-20100330-rb8r.html |title=Tax the banks and give to the poor, Robin Hood style  |author=[[Peter Singer]] |date=March 31, 2010 |work= |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then leaders of Europe's three biggest economies - [[Angela Merkel]] of Germany, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] of France and [[Gordon Brown]] of Britain -were "promoting a [[financial transaction tax]] as a way of raising as much as $US 400billion a year to fulfil commitments to domestic budgets, poverty reduction, global health and climate change mitigation."&lt;ref name = "Singer"/&gt; A coalition of community organizations in Australia also supported the tax.&lt;ref name = "Singer"/&gt;

[[File:Plaza de Aragón en Zaragoza el día de San Jorge.jpg|thumb|The ''Día de San Jorge'' in the ''Plaza de Aragón'', [[Zaragoza]], Spain]]
'''[[Saint George's Day]]''' is traditionally celebrated in several [[Nationalities and regions of Spain|regions]] of [[Spain]]. 

[[Saint George]] is the patron saint of the former [[Crown of Aragon]], since King [[Peter I of Aragon and Navarre|Peter I of Aragon]] won the [[Battle of Alcoraz]] with his patronage.
He is also patron of several cities. In most cases, the reason for those cities' relation with the Saint as their holy Patron is linked to historic events which happened during the "[[Reconquista]]."

The Saint's feast is also celebrated in many towns outside the former Crown of Aragon in Spain. Saint George has been the patron saint of [[Cáceres, Spain|Cáceres]], since 1229 A.D. Celebration of Saint George's Day in Cáceres is strongly centred in the world of legends. 
The saint, also is highly revered in the city of [[Alcoy]], who is the patron saint. In his honor they are celebrated the festival of Moors and Christians. Celebrations include a parade featuring re-enactors of Moorish and Christian soldiers but the core of the commemoration focuses mainly on the legend of Saint George slaying a dragon to save a princess (see: ''[[Saint George and the Dragon]]'').

==Legend==
This is primarily the legend popular all over [[Europe]]. For example, in [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]] – (the region changes Capadoccia kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Georgia, Lithuania, and Greece see Thurston, H., 1909. St. George.) – there was a dragon attacking the land. Scared to death, the inhabitants decided to give two lambs every day to the dragon to satisfy its hunger and prevent attack on the village. But when the animals became scarce it was decided to send a person, chosen by drawing lots, and a lamb. When a family member was devoured by the dragon, the family received a rich compensation from the Kingdom's Treasury.

There are two versions of the legend at this juncture: 
* First one involves people getting tired of no member of the royal family being sent and therefore decide that the princess should be sent to the Dragon
* The second says that one day a princess was chosen by drawing lots to accompany the lamb. In any case, on the cave of the dragon, the princess found a gentleman or knight of the name Jorge (Jordi catalá,  George english) and he slew the dragon by stabbing his sword into it and rescued her. From the blood that flowed from the lifeless body of the monster was born a red rose which the gentleman handed to the princess.

The king offered the gentleman all the riches imaginable but he preferred that the riches be allocated to the inhabitants of the kingdom. In addition, a church was built in his name, from which flowed miraculous water that was able to heal the sick.

Therefore, in places like Catalonia, Aragón,  Balearic and Valencia, or cities like Cáceres (Extremadura) (see Patronages of Saint George) it is customary on 23 April for men give away roses to women, like the knight who addressed the princess. The women give the men a book, remembering the death and burial respectively of two great European literary personalities, [[Miguel de Cervantes]] and [[Shakespeare]], and the Spanish notable literary personality, [[Inca Garcilaso]].

==Aragon==

As in the rest of the ancient [[Crown of Aragon]], the Feast of St George is celebrated enthusiastically in the Community of [[Aragon]], being the country's patron saint and its national day. On 23 April, Aragon celebrates its "Día de Aragón" (Day of Aragon) in commemoration of the [[Battle of Alcoraz]] (''Baralla d'Alcoraz'' in Aragonese), dated on 1096 Huesca was conquered by the Aragonese army, tradition says that Saint George appeared at a critical moment for the Christian Army, aiding them to win the battle for the "[[One true faith|True Faith]]".

As in [[Community of Catalonia]], roses and books are exchanged among individuals, often bearing ribbons with the colours of Aragon's flag.

'''''La Diada de Sant Jordi''''' ({{IPA-ca|lə ðiˈaðə ðə ˈsaɲ ˈʒɔɾði}}, Saint George's Day), also known as '''''El Dia de la Rosa''''' (The Day of the Rose) or '''''El Dia del Llibre''''' (The Day of the Book) is on 23 April, since 1926. The main event is the exchange of roses and books between sweethearts, loved ones and colleagues. Historically, men gave women [[rose]]s, and women gave men a book to celebrate the occasion – "a rose for love and a book forever." In modern times, the mutual exchange of books is also customary. Roses have been associated with this day since medieval times, but the giving of books is a more recent tradition originating in 1923, when a bookseller started to promote the holiday as a way to commemorate the nearly simultaneous deaths of [[Miguel Cervantes]] and [[William Shakespeare]] on 23 April 1616. [[Barcelona]] is the publishing capital of both [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and Spanish languages and the combination of love and literacy was quickly adopted.

In Barcelona's most visited street, [[La Rambla, Barcelona|La Rambla]], and all over Catalonia, thousands of stands of roses and makeshift bookstalls are set up for the occasion. By the end of the day, some six million roses and 800,000 books will have been purchased. Most women will carry a rose in hand, and half of the total yearly book sales in [[Catalonia]] take place on this occasion.

The [[sardana]], the national dance of Catalonia, is performed throughout the day in the [[Plaça Sant Jaume]] in Barcelona. Many book stores and cafes host readings by authors (including 24-hour marathon readings of different classics of [[Catalan literature]] or [[Spanish literature]]). Street performers and musicians in public squares add to the day's atmosphere.

23 April is also one of only three days a year when the [[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya|Palau de la Generalitat]], Barcelona's principal government building, is open to the public. The interior is decorated with roses to honour Saint George.

Catalonia exported its tradition of the book and the rose to the rest of the world. In 1995, [[UNESCO]] adopted 23 April as [[World Book Day]].

==Valencia==

The Community of [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] celebrates St George's Day with a different intensity, though in several zones it has similarities to Valentine's Day, like in Catalonia.

One notable celebration is in the Valencian city of [[Alcoi]]. There, Saint George's Day is commemorated as a thanksgiving celebration for the proclaimed aid the Saint provided to the Christian troops fighting the Muslims in the siege of the city. Its citizens commemorate the day with a festivity in which thousands of people parade in medieval costumes, forming two "armies" of [[Moros y cristianos|Moors and Christians]] and re-enacting the siege that gave the city to the Christians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2996">The '''Secte Rouge,''' also called the '''Cochon Gris''' or the '''Vinbrindingue''', is or was a [[secret society]] in [[Haiti]], which [[Zora Neale Hurston]] described in her 1938 book ''Tell My Horse''.&lt;ref&gt;''Tell My Horse: Vodou and Life in Haiti and Jamaica'' by Zora Neale Hurston, 1938 {{ISBN|0-06-091649-4}}, Chapter 14: "Secte Rouge"&lt;/ref&gt; Hurston's sources of information were lore related by Haitians, as well as a few earlier books.

==Overview==
She described them as a fearsome group of [[cannibalism|cannibals]] who performed rites distinct from [[Haitian Voodoo|vodoo]] practiced by many Hatians. According to Huston, Secte Rouge used counterfeit vodou ceremonies to hide their presence, and moreover that many of the practices abhorred by outsiders and attributed to vodou were actually committed by Secte Rouge (e.g., the [[grave robbery|robbery]] or desecration of graves).&lt;Ref&gt;Hurston, 1990 edition published by Harper Perennial: Modern Classics, pp 208-209&lt;/ref&gt; Hurston provided descriptions of Secte Rouge ceremonies to the gods [[Kalfu|Maitre Carrefour]] (Lord of the Cross Roads) and [[Baron Cimetière|Baron Maitre Cimiterre]], a deity involved with graveyards.

The Secte Rouge was held to have originated among slaves captured in the Mondongue region, now part of the [[Central African Republic]], said to have practiced cannibalism in their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Hurston, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Their behavior was held in check by slavery during the 1700s when France ruled the island, but with the [[Haitian Revolution]] and independence in 1804 the Secte Rouge were unleashed. The tenure of President [[Fabre Geffrard]] (1859-1867) was said to have been the peak years of the Secte Rouge. Anecdotes include stories of a [[midwife]] near who murdered newborn infants specifically to consume their flesh, and human fingernails being discovered in food sold as [[pig's feet]]. 

Hurston relates a conversation with an unidentified "high official of the Guarde d'Haiti" who said that police keep suspected Secte Rouge members under surveillance, hoping to gather evidence or observe criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;Hurston, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; The Secte Rouge members kept a strict code of secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Hurston, p. 216-217&lt;/ref&gt;

Two earlier works are cited as containing references to the Secte Rouge: ''Description topographique, physique, civile, politique et historique de la partie francaise de l'isle Saint-Domingue (Tome Premier)'' (1796) by [[Médéric Louis Élie Moreau de Saint-Méry]] and ''Life in a Haitian Valley'' (1937) by [[Melville J. Herskovits]].

== Secte Rouge in Popular Culture ==
In "[[The Man in the Morgue]]" episode 19 of the first season of the TV show [[Bones (TV series)]]. The secte rouge is portrayed as a group of vodou sorcerers who unbalance the world and seek to do evil.

The group appears in the [[Doctor Who]] spinoff novel ''White Darkness''.

==History==
===Origins: Persians and Arabs===
There are two main theories about the origins of the Shirazi people. One thesis based on [[oral tradition]] states that immigrants from the [[Shiraz]] region in southwestern [[Iran]] directly settled various mainland ports and islands on the eastern Africa seaboard beginning in the tenth century, in an area between [[Mogadishu]], [[Somalia]] in the north and [[Sofala]] in the south.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p379a"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|page=379|quote=According to oral tradition, beginning in the tenth century immigrants from the Shiraz region of Persia (now Iran) settled the islands and mainland ports of coastal East Africa, from Mogadishu, Somalia, in the north to the Sofala coast of Mozambique in the south. Many scholars, however, believe that the Shirazi actually began their settlement of the East Africa coast in the twelfth century and that they originated in Somalia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Derek Nurse|author2=Thomas Spear|author3=Thomas T.

By the time of the Persian settlement in the area, these earlier occupants had been displaced by incoming [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] populations.&lt;ref name="Kaplan42"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Irving|title=Area handbook for Kenya|date=1967|publisher=American University (Washington, D.C.).

The Shirazi, who were Islamized Persians, also arrived, and some towns, including Mombasa, came under Shirazi control for a time... Before the seventh century non-Negroid people are thought to have inhabited the coastal areas visited by the early traders. After the seventh century it is certain that the situation changed, for Negroid Africans were reported as inhabiting the coastal areas.}}&lt;/ref&gt; More people from different parts of the [[Persian Gulf]] also continued to migrate to the [[Swahili coast]] over several centuries thereafter, and these formed the modern Shirazi.&lt;ref name=fage201/&gt;

The second theory on Shirazi origins posits that they came from Persia, but first settled on the Somalia littoral near Mogadishu.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p379a"/&gt; In the twelfth century, as the gold trade with the distant entrepot of [[Sofala]] on the Mozambique seaboard grew, the settlers are then said to moved southwards to various coastal towns in Kenya, [[Tanzania]], northern Mozambique and the Indian Ocean islands. By 1200 AD, they had established local sultanates and mercantile networks on the islands of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], [[Mafia Island|Mafia]] and [[Comoros]] along the Swahili coast, and in northwestern [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=J.

These foreigners developed the trade of Mogadishu, which rapidly rose to a position of pre-eminence. In particular, they opened up the gold trade with the Sofala country, which until then can only have been on a minor scale. In furtherance of the trade with the south some of these merchants, ancestors of whom came from the Persian Gulf and who were remembered as of 'Shirazi' origin, settled on the islands of Mafia and Kilwa, rapidly, it appears, achieving a position of dominance.

The Shirazi people have been linked to the [[Lamu Archipelago]] – islands in the Indian Ocean close to north Kenya, which oral traditions claim were settled by seven brothers from Shiraz in south Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Finbarr Barry Flood|author2=Gulru Necipoglu|title=A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YgpDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA262 | year=2017|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-119-06857-0| pages=262–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lamu archipelago descendants then moved south in the 10th and 11th centuries. This is contested and the opposing view states that the Shirazi legend took on new importance in the 19th century, during the period of Omani domination. Claims of Persian Shirazi ancestry were used to distance locals from Arab newcomers. The emphasis that the Shirazi came very long ago and intermarried with indigenous locals is revisionist politics that attempts to fuse the Shirazi origins theory with Swahili heritage according to this view.&lt;ref&gt;Horton, Mark &amp; Middleton, John.

"Swahili Port Cities: The Architecture of Elsewhere." (Bloomington Indiana: Indiana University press, 2016) Pg. 99-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bantu-speaking Africans===
The ''Kilwa Chronicle'', a medieval document written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], indicates that the early Shirazi also settled in Hanzuan ([[Anjouan]] in the [[Comoros Islands]]), the Green Island ([[Pemba Island|Pemba]]), Mandakha, Shaugu and Yanbu.&lt;ref name=chittick275/&gt;&lt;ref name=fage201&gt;{{cite book|authors=J.

Their traditional Bantu lineage names were gradually abandoned and substituted with Arabic family names (e.g. Wapate became Batawiyna), new origin legends and social structures were imagined into folklores, and the societal structures were adopted from Persian and Arab settlers from nearby societies in Asia.&lt;ref name="Jerman1997p101"/&gt;

The Shirazi rulers established themselves on Mrima coast (Kenya) and the Sultan of Kilwa who identified himself as a Shirazi, overthrew the Omani governor in 1771. A French visitor to this Sultanate, named Morice estimated that about a tenth of the population was Swahili-speaking Arabs and Shirazi, a third were free Africans, and the remainder were African slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Iliffe|title=A Modern History of Tanganyika|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0dalboHfXgC |year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-29611-3|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swahili-Arabs moved further into the interior of Africa including Malawi to obtain slaves and ivory. One of Slave Trade Route was Nkhotakota where one of the Swahili-Arab slave traders, Salim-bin Abdullah (Jumbe) set up his headquarters on the shore of Lake Malawi in the 1840s. From Nkhota kotawhere he organized his expeditions to obtain slaves and ship them across the lake to East African markets, Kilwa.

===Islamic records===
Arab geographers from the twelfth and later centuries historically divided the eastern coast of Africa into several regions based on each region's respective inhabitants.&lt;ref name="FageOliver1975p190"/&gt; According to the twelfth century geography of Al-Idrisi, completed in 1154 CE, there were four littoral zones: ''[[Barbara (region)|Barbar]]'' (''Bilad al Barbar''; "land of the Berbers") in the [[Horn of Africa]], which was inhabited by [[Berbers]] and stretched southward to the Shebelle river; ''[[Zanj]]'' (''Ard al-Zanj''; "country of the blacks"), located immediately below that up to around Tanga or the southern part of Pemba island; ''Sofala'' (''Ard Sufala''), extending from Pemba to an unknown terminus, but probably around the Limpopo river; and ''Waq-Waq'', the shadowy land south thereof. However, earlier geographers make no mention of ''Sofala''. The texts written after twelfth century also call the island of Madagascar ''al-Qumr'', and include it as a part of ''Waq-Waq''.&lt;ref name="FageOliver1975p190"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. D.

[[Islam]] was introduced to the northern Somalia coast early on from the Arabian peninsula, shortly after the [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]].

To the south of the Barbar region, Al-Masudi mentions seaborne trade from [[Oman]] and Siraf port near [[Shiraz]] to the African Zanj coast, Sofala and Waq-Waq.&lt;ref name="FageOliver1975p190a"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.

Al-Masudi himself sailed across this sea with shipowners and captains from Siraf, embarking at Suhar in Oman. The last occasion he voyaged across it, returning from the island of Qanbalu to Oman, was in AD 916/17. He describes the goal of these voyages to have been this island, estimated as around 500 farsakhs (approx. 1,400 nautical miles) from Oman, and the country of Sufala and the Waq-Waq. Buzurg (a contemporary of Mas'udi) states that the place where ships normally went on to in the Zanj country was 800 farsakhs from Qanbalu, but sometimes ships were carried down to the cannibal country 1,500 farsakhs from Qanbalu. This indicates that trade was carried on as far south as the lower Mozambique coast.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Battuta]] would later visit the [[Kilwa Sultanate]] in the 14th century, which was at the time ruled by a Yemeni dynasty led by Sultan Hasan bin Sulayman.&lt;ref name="Pouwels"&gt;Randall Lee Pouwels, [https://www.google.com/books?id=RXDy4aRIKWUC&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false African and Middle Eastern world, 600-1500], (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Battuta described the local African ([[negro]]) inhabitants, who constituted the majority of Kilwa's residents, as "jet-black" in complexion and possessing facial tattoo marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Kenneth Neill|title=Humanity and Society: A World History|date=1977|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=0853454086|page=161|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=s9dWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battuta also described its ruler as often making slave and booty raids on the African idolators as he described the Zanj country.

Another set of records are found in the ''Book of the Zanj'' (''Kitab al-Zanuj''), a likely compilation of mythical oral traditions and memories of settled traders on the Swahili coast. The late 19th century document claims that Persians and Arabs were sent by governors of the Persian Gulf region to conquer and colonize the trading coast of East Africa. It also mentions the establishment of the Shirazi dynasty by Madagan and Halawani Arab merchants, whose identity and roots are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. D. Fage|author2=Roland Oliver|title=The Cambridge History of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWjxR61xAe0C |year=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-20981-6|pages=199–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to R. F. Morton, a critical assessment of the ''Book of the Zanj'' indicates that much of the document consists of deliberate falsifications by its author Fathili bin Omari, which were intended to invalidate the established oral traditions of local Bantu groups. The ''Kitab'''s ascription of Arabian origins for the founders of Malindi and other settlements on the Swahili coast is also contradicted by recorded 19th century clan and town traditions, which instead emphasize that these early Shirazi settlers were of Persian ancestral heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=R.

The regional evidence, particularly the gold trading Sofala region of Mozambique, suggests that these Shirazi Persians and Arabs had become rulers of the mainland settlements and islands on the Swahili coast, such as Mafia and Kilwa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J.

According to Abdulaziz Lodhi, the Iranians and Arabs called the Swahili coast ''Zangistan'' or ''Zangibar'', which literally means "the Black Coast", and the Muslim immigrants from South Asia (modern Pakistan&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/eastern-Africa#ref418889 Eastern Africa: Azania] Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; and India) to southern Arabian lands such as Oman and Yemen identified themselves as a Shirazi.&lt;ref name="Isaksson2005p353"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abdulaziz Y Lodhi|editor=Éva Ágnes Csató, Bo Isaksson and Carina Jahani|title=Linguistic Convergence and Areal Diffusion: Case Studies from Iranian, Semitic and Turkic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdA1K3E66UgC |year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-30804-5|pages=352–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Monaco2014p123"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adriana Piga|editor=Anna Irene Del Monaco|title=Rivista L'architettura delle città: The Journal of the Scientific Society Ludovico Quaroni no. 3-4-5/2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGprBgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Edizioni Nuova Cultura, Sapienza Universita di Roma|isbn=978-88-6812-355-0|pages=123–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslim Shirazi settlements on the Swahili coast maintained a close relationship with those on islands such as Comoros, through marriage and mercantile networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates Jr.|title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMZMAgAAQBAJ |year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517055-9|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tor Sellström, the Comorian population profile has a large proportion of Arab immigrants and African slaves, particularly on Grande Comore and Anjouan and these were under Shirazi sultanates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tor Sellström|title=Africa in the Indian Ocean: Islands in Ebb and Flow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1LFCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143|year=2015|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-29249-9|page=143}}, Quote: "Whereas the Malagasy influence is still present in Mayotte – (...) – it is, however, Arab immigrants and African slaves who more than others have contributed to the Comorian population profile, in particular on the main islands of Frande Comore and Anjouan. (...) Shirazi organized themselves into local sultanates, but did not seek to bring the archipelago under a common soverignty. As a result, the Comorian islands housed several sultanates, often within close vicinity."&lt;/ref&gt;

The contact of Shirazi people with colonial Europeans started with the arrival in Kilwa sultanate of [[Vasco da Gama]], the Portuguese explorer, in 1498. Few years later, the Portuguese and Shirazi people entered into disputes regarding trading routes and rights particularly about gold, a conflict that destroyed both Kilwa and Mombasa port towns of Shirazi rulers. The Portuguese military power and direct trading with India in the beginning, followed by other European powers, led to a rapid decline of the Shirazi towns which thrived and depended primarily on the trade.&lt;ref name=nimtz4/&gt; In parallel to European competition, non-Swahili-speaking Bantu groups began attacking Shirazi towns in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hashim|first1=Nadra O.|title=Language and Collective Mobilization: The Story of Zanzibar|date=2009|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0739137085|page=xiv|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LVFYmNO7BeEC|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Shirazi sultanates faced war from sea and land, leading to a rapid loss of power and trading facilities. The Omani Arabs re-asserted their military in the seventeenth century, and they defeated the Portuguese in 1698, at Mombasa. The Portuguese agreed to cede this part of Africa, and a fresh migration of Arabs from Oman and Yemen into the Shirazi people settlements followed.&lt;ref name=nimtz4&gt;{{cite book|author=August H.

It belongs to the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] branch of the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] family.&lt;ref name="Ethnologuezdj"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comorian, Ngazidja| url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/zdj| publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dialects of Swahili language is best described as a syncretic language, that blended Sabaki Bantu, Comoro, Pokomo, Iranian, Arabic and Indian words and structure reflecting the syncretic fusion of people from diverse backgrounds that form the Shirazi people.&lt;ref name="Nimtz1980p3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=piga122&gt;{{cite book|author=Adriana Piga|editor=Anna Irene Del Monaco|title=Rivista L'architettura delle città: The Journal of the Scientific Society Ludovico Quaroni no. 3-4-5/2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGprBgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Edizioni Nuova Cultura, Sapienza Universita di Roma|isbn=978-88-6812-355-0|pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', the [[Comorian language|Comorian]] Swahili variety is divided into four principal dialects: Ngazidja, Ndzwani, Maore and Mwawli. Ngazidja is spoken on the Grande Comore Autonomous Island, and has around 312,000 total speakers.&lt;ref name="Ethnologuezdj"/&gt; Ndzwani is spoken on the Anjouan Autonomous Island, and has roughly 275,000 total speakers.&lt;ref name="Ethnologuewni"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comorian, Ndzwani|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/wni|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maore is spoken on the Comoros, [[Mayotte]] and [[Madagascar]] islands, and has an estimated 136,500 total speakers.&lt;ref name="Ethnologueswb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comorian, Maore|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/swb|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mwali is spoken on the Moheli Autonomous Island, and has about 28,700 total speakers.&lt;ref name="Ethnologuewlc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comorian, Mwali|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/wlc|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers of the Ngazidja,&lt;ref name="Ethnologuezdj"/&gt; Ndzwani,&lt;ref name="Ethnologuewni"/&gt; and Maore Comorian dialects use the Naskh variant of the [[Arabic script]] as their writing system.&lt;ref name="Ethnologueswb"/&gt;

==Society and culture==
The Shirazi people have primarily been a mercantile community, thriving on trade. Initially, between the 10th and 12th centuries, it was the gold producing regions of Mozambique that brought them to the coast of Africa. Later the trading in African slaves, ivory, spices, silk and produce from clove, coconut and other plantations run with slave labor became the mainstay of the trading activity.&lt;ref name="Monaco2014p123"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nimtz39&gt;{{cite book|author=August H.

According to August Nimtz, after international slave trading was banned, the Shirazi community was economically crippled.&lt;ref name=nimtz39/&gt;

The arrival of Islam with the Persians and Arabs affected the Shirazi identity and social structures in many ways. According to Helena Jerman, the word "Sawahil" among the Shirazi people referred to "free but landless" strata of the society who had adopted Islam, then a new social category on the Swahili coast.&lt;ref name="Jerman1997p101"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helena Jerman|title=Between Five Lines: The Development of Ethnicity in Tanzania with Special Reference to the Western Bagamoyo District|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XaRCXzxokJUC |year=1997|publisher=Nordic Africa Institute|isbn=978-91-7106-408-0|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Muslims, this was the lowest social strata of free people, just above the slave strata. Along with the ''Wa-shirazi'' strata, there were other strata, such as the ''Wa-arabu'', ''Wa-manga'', ''Wa-shihiri'', ''Wa-shemali'', and the noble pure Arab ruler category called ''Wa-ungwana''.&lt;ref name="Jerman1997p101"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Diedrich Westermann|author2=Edwin William Smith|author3=Cyril Daryll Forde|title=Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iokMAQAAMAAJ| year=1989| publisher=Oxford University Press| pages=147–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chuo Uchunguzi|title=Kiswahili, Volumes 47-49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nAUqAQAAIAAJ|edition=East African Swahili Committee|year=1977|publisher=Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salaam|pages=78–79|oclc= 241337134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social strata of the Shirazi people came with its own strata taboos and privileges. For example, the upper strata Waungwana (also called ''Swahili-Arabs''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kasfir | first=Sidney L. | title=Tourist aesthetics in the global flow: Orientalism and "warrior theatre" on the Swahili Coast | journal=Visual Anthropology | volume=17 | issue=3-4 | year=2004 | pages=319–343 | doi=10.1080/089460490468171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Harries | first=Lyndon | title=The Arabs and Swahili Culture | journal=Africa | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=34 | issue=03 | year=1964 | pages=224–229 | doi=10.2307/1158023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) had the exclusive right to build prestigious stone houses, and Waungwana men practiced polygynous [[hypergamy]], that is father children with low status and slave women. The ritual and sexual purity of the Waungwana women were maintained by confining them to certain premises within these houses, called ''Ndani''.&lt;ref name="Nelson2007p24"&gt;{{cite book|author=Diane Lyons|editor=Sarah M.

According to Michel Ben Arrous and Lazare Ki-Zerbo, the Shirazi society has been "fractured by the caste implications of race and class".&lt;ref name=arrous110/&gt; As the Arabs who arrived from Persia and Arabian lands became slave owners and traders, they considered their slaves as inferior and unfit for Islam. The slave girls were concubines, who bore them children. The male offspring were considered Muslims, but the female offspring inherited their slavery and their non-Muslim heritage. Even in post-colonial society, the residual dynamics and distinctions of a racial caste system have remained among some Shirazi people.&lt;ref name=arrous110&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michel Ben Arrous|author2=Lazare Ki-Zerbo|title=African Studies in Geography from Below|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4PQK68LNtjcC&amp;pg=PA110 |year=2009|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-2-86978-231-0|pages=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the sociologist Jonas Ewald and other scholars, the social stratification is not limited in the Shirazi society to racial lines, but extends to economic status and the region of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonas Ewald|title=Challenges for the Democratisation Process in Tanzania: Moving Towards Consolidation 50 Years After Independence?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f2ZlRMNai4gC |year=2013|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9987-08-250-6|pages=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Calas|title=From Dar Es Salaam to Bongoland: Urban Mutations in Tanzania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_pjmU2v2bvEC |year=2010|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9987-08-094-6|pages=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shirazi culture is Islamic in nature, identifying largely with its Persian and Arabic roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Molefi Kete Asante|title=The History of Africa: The Quest for Eternal Harmony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPnDBAAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-01349-3|pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also Bantu influences, such as the Swahili language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Spear | first=Thomas | title=The Shirazi in Swahili Traditions, Culture, and History | journal=History in Africa | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=11 | year=1984 | page=291 | doi=10.2307/3171638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to G. Thomas Burgess, Ali Sultan Issa and Seif Sharif Hamad, many Africans "claimed Shirazi identity to obscure their slave ancestry, to mark their status as landowners, or to gain access to World War II rations distributed by the colonial state along ethnic lines." Shirazi consider themselves as of Persian ancestry primarily, and more consistently regard themselves as neither Arabs nor recent labor migrants from mainland Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=G.

If it is not always clear what the label represents in a positive sense, its negative claims are more consistent: Shirazi are neither Arabs nor "mainlanders", recent labor migrants from the African mainland.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3736">'''Sick role''' is a term used in [[medical sociology]] regarding sickness and the rights and obligations of the affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Millon|first=Theodore |author2=Paul H. Blaney |author3=Roger D. Davis |title=Oxford Textbook of Psychopathology|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=1999|pages=446|isbn=978-0-19-510307-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a concept created by American [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Talcott Parsons]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="Parsons (1951)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parsons|first1=Talcott|title=The Social System|date=1951|publisher=The Free Press|location=Glencoe, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Parsons was a [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalist sociologist]], who argued that being sick means that the sufferer enters a role of 'sanctioned deviance'. This is because, from a functionalist perspective, a sick individual is not a productive member of society. Therefore this deviance needs to be policed, which is the role of the medical profession. Genuinely, Parsons argued that the best way to understand illness sociologically is to view it as a form of deviance which disturbs the social function of the society.

The general idea is that the individual who has fallen ill is not only physically sick, but now adheres to the specifically patterned social role of being sick. ‘Being Sick’ is not simply a ‘state of fact’ or ‘condition’, it contains within itself customary rights and obligations based on the social norms that surround it. The theory outlined two rights of a sick person and two obligations:

*Rights:
** The sick person is exempt from normal social roles
** The sick person is not responsible for their condition
*Obligations:
** The sick person should try to get well
** The sick person should seek technically competent help and cooperate with the medical professional

There are three versions of sick role: 
# Conditional
# Unconditionally legitimate
# Illegitimate role: condition that is stigmatized by others

==Criticisms==

*Rejecting the sick role.
**This model assumes that the individual voluntarily accepts the sick role.
**Individual may not comply with expectations of the sick role, may not give up social obligations, may resist dependency, may avoid public sick role if their illness is stigmatised.
**Individual may not accept  'passive patient' role.
*Doctor Patient relationship.
**Going to see doctor may be the end of a process of help seeking behaviour, Freidson (1970) discusses importance of 'lay referral system'- lay person consults significant lay groups first.
**This model assumes 'ideal' patient and 'ideal' doctor roles See- Murcott (1981), Sacks (1967), Bloor &amp; Horobin (1975).
**Differential treatment of patient, and differential doctor patient relationship- variations depend on social class, gender and ethnicity. See- MacIntyre &amp; Oldman (1984), Buchan &amp; Richardson (1973), Sudnow (1967).
* Blaming the sick.
**'Rights' do not always apply.
**Sometimes individuals are held responsible for their illness, i.e. illness associated with sufferers lifestyle. (See Chalfont &amp; Kurtz: 1971, on alcoholism).
**In stigmatised illness sufferer is often not accepted as legitimately sick.
*Chronic Illness.
**Model fits acute illness (measles, appendicitis, relatively short term conditions).
**Does not fit chronic/long-term/permanent illness as easily, getting well not an expectation with chronic conditions such as blindness, diabetes.
**In chronic illness acting the sick role is less appropriate and less functional for both individual and social system.
**Chronically ill patients are often encouraged to be independent.

In the [[Russian Empire]], '''''snokhachestvo''''' ({{lang-ru|снохачество|lit=daughter-in-law privileges}}) referred to [[human sexual activity|sexual relations]] between a [[pater familias]] (''bolshak'') of a Russian peasant household (''dvor'') and his [[daughter-in-law]] (''snokha'') during the minority or absence of his son.

With a view to attracting additional workers to the household, marriages in rural Russia were frequently contracted when the groom was six or seven years old. During her husband's minority, the bride often had to tolerate advances of her assertive father-in-law. For example, in the middle of the 19th century in [[Tambov Governorate]] 12-13 year old boys were often married to 16-17 year old girls. The boys' fathers used to [[Arranged marriage|arrange]] such marriages to take advantage of their sons' lack of experience. ''Snokhachestvo'' entailed conflicts in the family and put moral pressure on the mother-in-law, who usually treated her son's wife as a rival for her own husband's affections.

''Snokachestvo'' was considered [[incest]]uous by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and unseemly by the ''[[obshchina]]'', the rural community. Legally it was considered a form of [[rape]] and was punished with fifteen to twenty lashes. Understandably, cases of ''snokhachestvo'' were not publicized and the crime remained latent, making it difficult to assess its true extent in the Russian Empire.

One of the first Russian writers to decry ''snokhachestvo'', describing it as a form of "sexual debasement," was [[Alexander Radishchev]], who saw it as an outgrowth of [[Russian serfdom]]. In the 19th century, its resurgence was fueled by obligatory [[conscription in Russia|conscription]] and "the seasonal departure of young men for work outside the village."&lt;ref name="Engelstein"&gt;Engelstein, Laura. ''The Keys to Happiness: Sex and the Search for Modernity in Fin-de-siècle Russia''. Cornell University Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-8014-9958-5}}, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Snokhachestvo'' remained relatively widespread even after the [[Emancipation Manifesto|abolition of serfdom]] in 1861. [[Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov]], a jurist, resented the fact that "nowhere it seems, except Russia, has at least one form of incest assumed the character of an almost normal everyday occurrence, designated by the appropriate technical term."&lt;ref name="Engelstein"/&gt; The [[Narodnik]] writer [[Gleb Uspensky]], while deploring the plight of young peasant women, sympathized with "the emotional and physical needs of the mature peasant man."&lt;ref&gt;Mondry, Henrietta. ''Pure, Strong And Sexless: The Peasant Woman's Body and Gleb Uspensky''. Rodopi, 2005. {{ISBN|90-420-1828-3}}, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Snokhachestvo in the arts==

There are sexual connotations in the relationship between Katerina and her father-in-law in [[Shostakovich]]'s 1934 opera ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', but not in the 1865 [[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (story)|story it is based upon]].

In 1927, [[Olga Preobrazhenskaya (director)|Olga Preobrazhenskaia]], "the leading woman director of {{bracket|Soviet}} fiction films in the twenties," and her co-director, [[Ivan Pravov]], released a film condemning ''snokhachestvo''.  Titled ''The Peasant Women of Riazan'' (in Russian, ''Baby ryazanskie''), the [[silent film]] is about the rape and pregnancy of a woman whose husband is away in [[World War I]]. The rapist is her father-in-law, and the woman, overcome by shame, drowns herself when her husband returns from battle.&lt;ref name="MASSES"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oYaD9Uoxd9IC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=snokhachestvo&amp;source=web&amp;ots=2LufpoekoR&amp;sig=Hj9hffT_XjAXlzE-V6anuKdlkWY#PPA168,M1 ''Movies for the Masses: Popular Cinema and Soviet Society in the 1920s] by Denise Jeanne Youngblood.

Tariq was traveling, by road, from his home in [[Peshawar]], to Afghanistan's nearby capital, [[Kabul]].
His vehicle was stopped by gunmen and he was taken hostage along with his driver Gul Nawaz and bodyguard Amir Sultan in Pakistan's [[Khyber Tribal Agency]], prior to passing through the border crossing at [[Towr Kham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=43779|title=The News International: Latest News Breaking, Pakistan News|website=www.thenews.com.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Disability}}
This '''disability rights timeline''' lists events relating to the [[Disability rights|civil rights of people with disabilities]] in the [[United States of America]], including court decisions, the passage of legislation, activists' actions, significant abuses of people with disabilities that illustrate their lack of civil rights at the time, and the founding of various organizations. Although the disability rights movement itself began in the 1960s, advocacy for the rights of people with disabilities started much earlier and continues to the present.

==18th century==
*1776 - Following the Revolutionary War, servicemen who suffered significant injuries or were unable to provide for their household were financially supported by the first pension law, which was enacted by the Continental Congress on August 26, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Ed|title=Pensions Enacted by Congress for American Revolutionary War Veterans|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~fayfamily/pensions.html|website=RootsWeb|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
* 1817 – The [[American School for the Deaf]] was founded in Hartford, Connecticut. This was the first school for children with disabilities anywhere in the western hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/disabilityrightstimeline.htm |title=Disability History Timeline |year=2002 |work=Rehabilitation Research &amp; Training Center on Independent Living Management |publisher=[[Temple University]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220065328/http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/disabilityrightstimeline.htm |archive-date=20 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1840s - The [[M'Naghten rule]] (pronounced and sometimes spelled, "McNaughton") is any variant of the 1840s jury instruction in a [[criminal case]] when there is a [[defense of insanity]]: 
:''"that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and... that to establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong."''&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|632}} The rules so formulated as ''M'Naghten's Case'' 1843 10 C &amp; F 200&lt;ref name="m'naghtenscase"&gt;{{cite web|last=United Kingdom House of Lords Decisions|title=DANIEL M'NAGHTEN'S CASE.

When the tests set out by the Rules are satisfied, the accused may be adjudged "not guilty by reason of insanity" or "guilty but insane" and the [[sentence (law)|sentence]] may be a mandatory or discretionary (but usually indeterminate) period of treatment in a secure hospital facility, or otherwise at the discretion of the [[court]] (depending on the country and the offence charged) instead of a punitive disposal. The insanity defence is recognized in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[England and Wales]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]] and most [[U.S. state]]s with the exception of Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Utah, and Vermont&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=13&amp;Chapter=157&amp;Section=04802|title=Vermont Statutes Online|website=www.leg.state.vt.us|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all of these jurisdictions still use the M'Naghten Rules.
* 1864 – The U.S. Congress authorized the [[Gallaudet University#History|Columbia Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind]] to confer college degrees, and President Abraham Lincoln signed the bill into law. [[Edward Miner Gallaudet]] was made president of the entire corporation, including the college. It was the first college in the world established for people with disabilities and is now known as [[Gallaudet University]].&lt;ref name="Timeline"/&gt;
* Late 1800s - 1970s: From the late 1800s until the 1970s, some American cities had unsightly beggar ordinances known colloquially as [[ugly laws]].&lt;ref name="EnDisb"/&gt; These laws deemed it illegal for "any person, who is diseased, maimed, mutilated or deformed in any way, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, to expose himself to public view."&lt;ref name="EnDisb"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albrecht|first1=general ed.

* 1867 - The first American ordinance pertaining to preventing people with disabilities from appearing in public was one passed in 1867 in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="TheUglyLaws"/&gt; This ordinance had to do with the broader topic of [[begging]].&lt;ref name="TheUglyLaws"/&gt; The wording in the San Francisco ordinance indicates violators will be sent to the [[almshouse]].&lt;ref name="TheUglyLaws"/&gt; This connects with the [[Victorian Era]] poor law policy.&lt;ref name="TheUglyLaws"/&gt;
* 1867 -  The first recorded arrest pertaining to [[ugly law]]s was Martin Oates in San Francisco, California in July 1867.&lt;ref name="TheUglyLaws"/&gt; Oates was a former [[Union Army|Union soldier]] during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="TheUglyLaws"/&gt;
* 1869 - ''[[State v. Pike]]'', 49 N.h. 399 (1869), is a criminal case which articulated a [[product test]] for an [[insanity defense]].&lt;ref name=IECJ&gt;Insanity, 2 Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice 736-40 (1983); Abraham Goldstein&lt;/ref&gt; The court in ''[[Durham v. United States (1954)|Durham v. United States]]'' used it as the basis for what came to be known as the [[Durham rule]].&lt;ref name=IECJ/&gt;
* 1880 – The [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] was founded in Cincinnati, Ohio; a non-profit for Deaf rights now headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland.
* 1881 - Portland, Oregon enacted an [[ugly law]].&lt;ref name="Schweik2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan M. Schweik|title=The Ugly Laws: Disability in Public|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxAWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|date=30 August 2010|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-8361-0|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1881 - A Chicago ordinance of 1881 read as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Any person who is diseased, maimed, mutilated, or in any way deformed, so as to be an unsightly or disgusting object, or an improper person to be allowed in or on the streets, highways, thoroughfares, or public places in the city, shall not therein or thereon expose himself to public view, under the penalty of a fine of $1 for each offense (Chicago City Code 1881)&lt;ref name="TheUglyLaws"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The fine of $1 equates to more than $20 in 2018.
* 1881-1890 - At some time from 1881 to 1890 an [[ugly law]] was enacted in Omaha, Nebraska.&lt;ref name="Schweik2010"/&gt; 
* 1887 – The graphic depiction of conditions at the [[The Octagon (Roosevelt Island, New York)|Women's Lunatic Asylum]] on [[Blackwell's Island]] in [[Nellie Bly]]'s book ''[[Ten Days in a Mad-House]]'' caused a sensation, which brought Bly lasting fame and prompted a grand jury to launch its own investigation, with Bly assisting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nellie Bly Led the Way |url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/undercover/sites/dlib.nyu.edu.undercover/files/documents/uploads/editors/Nellie-Bly-Led-the-Way.pdf |date=3 November 1887 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury's report resulted in an $850,000 increase in the budget of the Department of Public Charities and Corrections. The grand jury also made sure that future examinations were more thorough so that only the seriously ill went to the asylum.
* 1889 - [[Ugly laws]] were enacted in Denver, Colorado and Lincoln, Nebraska in 1889. 
* 1894 - An [[ugly law]] was enacted in Columbus, Ohio in 1894.
* 1891 - An [[ugly law]] was enacted for the state of Pennsylvania in 1891. This law contained language applying to [[cognitive disability]] as well as physical disability.&lt;ref name="TheUglyLaws"/&gt;

==1900 – 1969==
* 1910 - ''[[State v. Strasburg]]'', 110 P. 1020 (Wash. 1910), was a case decided by the [[Washington Supreme Court]] that held that a [[statute]] eliminating the [[insanity defense]] was unconstitutional.  The court likened the exclusion of evidence of insanity to a denial of trial by jury.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie, R.J. et al.  ''Criminal Law, Second Edition.''  Foundation Press, New York: 2004, p. 623&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1914 - ''[[Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospital]]'', 105 N.E. 92 (N.Y. 1914), was a decision issued by the [[New York Court of Appeals]] in 1914 which established principles of [[informed consent]] and [[respondeat superior]] in [[United States]] [[law]].&lt;ref name="theory of informed consent"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faden|first1=Ruth|last2=Beauchamp|first2=Tom L.|authorlink1=Ruth Faden|authorlink2=Tom Beauchamp|title=A history and theory of informed consent|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195036867|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1915 - [[Harry Haiselden]] was the [[Chief Surgeon]] at the [[German-American Hospital]] in [[Chicago]], and in 1915 he refused to perform needed surgery for children born with severe birth defects and allowed them to die, in an act of [[eugenics]].&lt;ref name=refuses&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dr. Haiselden of Chicago Refuses to Operate to Save a Day-Old Infant.

* 1918 – The [[Smith-Sears Veterans Rehabilitation Act]] became law, and provided for the promotion of vocational rehabilitation and return to civil employment of disabled persons discharged from the U.S. military.&lt;ref name="Timeline"/&gt;
* 1920s: Psychiatrist [[Henry Cotton (doctor)|Henry Cotton]] worked at [[Trenton Psychiatric Hospital|Trenton State Hospital]] in New Jersey. He became convinced that insanity was fundamentally a toxic disorder and in the 1920s he surgically removed body parts to try to improve mental health.&lt;ref name=freck/&gt; This often began with the removal of teeth and [[tonsils]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An 18 year-old girl with agitated depression successively had her upper and lower molars extracted, a [[tonsillectomy]], [[sinus (anatomy)|sinus]] drainage, treatment for an infected [[cervix]], removal of [[intestinal adhesions]]—all without effecting improvement in her psychiatric condition. Then the remainder of her teeth were removed and she was sent home, pronounced cured.&lt;ref name=freck&gt;Freckelton, Ian (1 November 2005). "Madhouse: A Tragic Tale of Megalomania and Modern Medicine (Book review)". Psychiatry, Psychology and Law. 12 (2): 435–438.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Andrew Scull]] argues that Cotton's obsession with [[Focal infection theory|focal sepsis]] as the root cause of mental illness "persisted in spite of all evidence to the contrary and the frightening incidence of death and harm from the operations he initiated".&lt;ref name=freck/&gt;  Cotton's approach attracted some detractors, but the medical establishment of the day did not effectively renounce or discipline him.&lt;ref name=freck/&gt;
* 1924 - The [[Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924]] provided for [[compulsory sterilization]] of persons deemed to be "feebleminded," including the "insane, idiotic, imbecile, or epileptic."&lt;ref name="state1"&gt;HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 607 (HJ607ER), "Expressing the General Assembly's regret for Virginia's experience with eugenics", [http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?011+ful+HJ607ER Virginia Legislative Information System]&lt;/ref&gt; This Sterilization Act was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'' 274 U.S. 200 (1927). In 1979, Virginia's Assembly repealed the Act. In 2001, the legislature overwhelmingly passed a bill (HJ607ER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?011+ful+HJ607ER|title=Bill Tracking - 2001 session &gt; Legislation|website=leg1.state.va.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to express the assembly's profound regret for its role in the eugenics movement. On May 2, 2002, Governor [[Mark R. Warner]] issued a statement also expressing "profound regret for the commonwealth's role in the eugenics movement," specifically naming Virginia's 1924 [[compulsory sterilization]] legislation, which includes though is not limited to the [[Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost2002"&gt;{{cite web|last=Branigin |first=William |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/05/03/warner-apologizes-to-victims-of-eugenics/87a14c82-da36-4551-9c28-98d001131bfc/ |title=Warner Apologizes To Victims Of Eugenics |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2002-05-03 |accessdate=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1927 - ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'', {{ussc|274|200|1927}}, is a decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], written by Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], in which the Court ruled that a [[Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924|state statute]] permitting [[compulsory sterilization]] of the unfit, including the [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]], "for the protection and health of the state" did not violate the Due Process clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The decision was largely seen as an endorsement of [[Eugenics#Meanings and types|negative eugenics]]—the attempt to improve the human race by eliminating "defectives" from the [[gene pool]].

The Baker Act allows for involuntary examination (what some call [[involuntary commitment|emergency or involuntary commitment]]).  It can be initiated by judges, law enforcement officials, physicians, or mental health professionals.  There must be evidence that the person:
* possibly has a mental illness (as defined in the Baker Act).
* is a harm to self, harm to others, or self neglectful (as defined in the Baker Act).

There must be evidence of recent behavior to justify the substantial likelihood of serious bodily harm in the near future. Moments in the past, when an individual may have considered harming themselves or another, do not qualify the individual as meeting the criteria. ("Near" means close, short, or draws near.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0300-0399/0394/0394.html|title = Statutes &amp; Constitution : View Statutes : Online Sunshine|website = www.leg.state.fl.us|access-date = 2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examinations may last up to 72 hours after a person is deemed medically stable and occur in over 100 [[Florida Department of Children and Families]]-designated receiving facilities statewide. There are many possible outcomes following examination of the patient. This includes the release of the individual to the community (or other community placement), a petition for involuntary inpatient placement (what some call civil commitment), involuntary outpatient placement (what some call outpatient commitment or assisted treatment orders), or voluntary treatment (if the person is competent to consent to voluntary treatment and consents to voluntary treatment). The involuntary outpatient placement language in the Baker Act took effect as part of the Baker Act reform in 2005.

* 1972 - The [[Oregon Court of Appeals]] upheld the sterilization of a seventeen-year-old mentally ill girl with a history of sexual and physical abuse by her family. The Court based its decision on the recommendation of the State Board of Social Protection and the testimony of a psychiatrist who stated that the patient would never be able to provide parental guidance and judgment, saying, "she would never be able to provide the parental guidance and judgment which a child requires even though she might be able to master the skills necessary to take physical care of herself and a child."&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;Cook v. State, 9 Or. App. 224, 227, 495 P.2d 768, 770 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;
The psychiatrist "based this conclusion on the girl's lack of emotional control, her consistent low scores in areas of judgment on psychological tests, and the likelihood that she would abuse a child."&lt;ref name="cook"/&gt;
* 1972 - ''[[United States v. Brawner]]'', 471 F.2d 969 (D.C. Cir. 1972), is a decision by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] in which the Court held that a person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. The case relied on the [[Durham rule]] for determining whether a defendant was [[not guilty by reason of insanity]]. The Court ruled that the primary reason they were departing from the old test of insanity is that it put substantial dominance on the testimony of experts. The Court exhaustively examined the justification for the defense of insanity and the need to guide the jury with a specific framework for the insanity defense. The American Law Institute provided a better framework in the majority’s opinion because it took part of the reliance on experts away and focused on the acts and mental state of a defendant at the time he committed the acts constituting the crime.&lt;ref name=IECJ3&gt;Insanity, Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice 735-40 (1983); Abraham Goldstein&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|634}} It proposed a rule that was adopted as the American Law Institute Model Penal Code rule ([[ALI rule]]).&lt;ref name=IECJ3/&gt;

A 1972 television broadcast from the [[Willowbrook State School]], titled "Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace," outraged the general public. However, it took 3 years from the time the lawsuit documents were filed before the consent judgement was signed. In 1975, the consent judgement was signed, and it committed New York state to improve community placement for the now designated "Willowbrook Class." The [[Willowbrook State School]] was closed in 1987, and all but about 150 of the former Willowbrook residents were moved to group homes by 1992.&lt;ref name="Timeline"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sproutflix.org/content/willowbrook-last-great-disgrace |title=Sproutflix website description of film titled Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace |publisher= |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724153008/http://sproutflix.org/content/willowbrook-last-great-disgrace |archivedate=24 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.htmlres=9F0CE4D71E3EF931A25750C0A965958260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1|title=New York Times article, "Big Day for Ex-Residents Of Center for the Retarded," by Celia W.

The original 1974 decision mandated warning the threatened individual, but a 1976 rehearing of the case by the California Supreme Court called for a "duty to protect" the intended victim. The professional may discharge the duty in several ways, including notifying police, [[duty to warn|warning the intended victim]], and/or taking other reasonable steps to protect the threatened individual.

Their request was denied by [[New Jersey Superior Court]] Judge Robert Muir Jr. in November 1975. Judge Muir cited that Quinlan's doctors did not support removing her from the ventilator, that whether or not to do so was a medical rather than a judicial decision, and that doing so would violate New Jersey homicide statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heimer|first=Carol|chapter=The Unstable Alliance of Law and Morality|editor1-last=Hitlin |editor1-first=Steven |editor2-last=Vaisey |editor2-first=Stephen|date=December 6, 2012 |title=Handbooks of Sociology and Social Research|publisher=Springer |pages=181–182 |isbn=1441968954}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quinlans appealed the decision to the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]].

District Court Judge John Lewis Smith ruled for them and ordered DHEW (the U.S. Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare) to develop the Section 504 regulation to prohibit discrimination against "handicapped persons" in any federally funded program. In January, 1977, Mathews (then the U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare) refused to sign the prepared regulation, and James Cherry and his co-plaintiffs went back to the U. S. District Court, where Mathews was held in contempt of court for refusing to follow the Cherry court order.

* 1980 - The [[California Court of Appeal]] held in 1980 (in ''Curlender v. Bio-Science Laboratories'', 165 Cal.Rptr. 477, 488 (Cal.App. 1980)) that "a reverent appreciation of life compels recognition that [a wrongful life] plaintiff, however impaired she may be, has come into existence as a living person with certain rights" – i.e. the right to recover against a doctor whose negligence resulted in her disease.&lt;ref&gt;Curlender v. Bio-Science Laboratories, 165 Cal.Rptr. 477, 488 (Cal.App. 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; The Curlender decision involved a child who was allegedly born with Tay-Sachs disease after the parents relied upon the defendants' representations about the reliability of their genetic tests in refraining from proceeding with amniocentesis.

* 1981 - The [[Alaska Supreme Court]] held that an [[Judiciary of Alaska#Superior courts|Alaskan Superior Court]] has the authority to order the sterilization of a mental incompetent upon petition by the incompetent's legal guardian if it is proven with clear and convincing evidence that sterilization is in the best interest of the incompetent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Supreme Court of Alaska | title=Matter of CDM 627 P.2d 607 (1981). | url=http://law.justia.com/cases/alaska/supreme-court/1981/4764-1.html | access-date=June 13, 2016 | quote=This appeal raises the question of whether the superior court has the authority to order the sterilization of a mental incompetent upon petition by the incompetent's legal guardian. We conclude that the superior court, as a court of general jurisdiction, does have the authority to entertain and act upon such a petition.  [...]  Basic notions of procedural due process require that the incompetent be afforded a full judicial hearing at which medical testimony is presented and the incompetent, through a guardian ad litem, is allowed to present proof and cross-examine witnesses.  The advocates of the proposed operation bear the heavy burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that sterilization is in the best interests of the incompetent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=Once the district court determines preliminary matters, it must find by clear and convincing evidence that the sterilization is medically essential. A sterilization is medically essential if clearly necessary, in the opinion of experts, to preserve the life or physical or mental health of the mentally retarded person. The term "medically essential" is reasonably precise and provides protection from abuses prevalent in this area in the past. The term also avoids confusion as to whose interests are to be considered. It is not the welfare of society, or the convenience or peace of mind of parents or guardians that these standards are intended to protect. The purpose of the standards is to protect the health of the minor retarded person, and to prevent that person’s fundamental procreative rights from being abridged. In some circumstances, the possibility of pregnancy, if supported by sufficient evidence that it would threaten the physical or mental health of the person and that no less intrusive means of birth control would prove safe and effective, could justify granting a petition for sterilization as medically essential.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court defined "medically essential" as a procedure that is "clearly necessary, in the opinion of experts, to preserve the life or physical or mental health of the mentally retarded person.&lt;ref name="aw1981"/&gt;

* 1985 - In ''People v. Skinner'' (1985), the California Supreme Court further specified the criteria for "settled insanity". The person must have a mental illness that is relatively stable over time, not caused solely by the length of time the substance was abused, and it must also meet the legal definition of insanity in that jurisdiction.  Therefore, it appears that the court is stating that a threshold condition for the insanity defense exists when there is a permanent impairment caused by chronic substance abuse in a person with a preexisting mental illness unrelated to substance abuse, but aggravated or set off by voluntary intoxication.&lt;ref name="intox"&gt;{{cite web

The Court stated that "academic achievement is not the only purpose of mainstreaming. Integrating a handicapped child into a nonhandicapped environment may be beneficial in and of itself...even if the child cannot flourish academically." The Circuit Court developed a two-pronged test to determine if the district's actions were in compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA): 1) Can education in the regular classroom with the use of supplemental aids and services be achieved satisfactorily? 2) If it cannot, has the school mainstreamed the child to the maximum extent appropriate? &lt;ref name="kidstogether.org"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon remand, the lower court ruled against the forcible medication of individuals in order to maintain their competency for execution. This decision was based on the distinction that, unlike the holding in ''Harper v. Washington'' concerning involuntary medication for treatment issues, forcing medication for the purposes of execution was not medical treatment (being "antithetical to the basic principles of the healing arts") but punishment.&lt;ref name="melton1997"/&gt; In addition, the lower court found two state laws on which to base its holding. First it found that forcibly medicating a person for the purposes of execution was [[cruel and unusual punishment]] under Louisiana state law because "it fails to measurably contribute to the social goals of capital punishment" by adding to the individual's punishment "beyond that required for the mere extinguishment of life," and could be "administered erroneously, arbitrarily or capriciously".&lt;ref name="melton1997"/&gt; It also held that forcible medication in this situation violated the [[right to privacy]] guaranteed by the Louisiana State Constitution because the inhumanity of the situation rendered the state's interest in executing a person under these conditions less compelling.&lt;ref name="melton1997"/&gt;

* 1994 - [[Baby K|Stephanie Keene]] was born at [[Inova Fairfax Hospital|Fairfax Hospital]] in Virginia, the United States. At the time of her birth, she was missing most of her brain, including the cortex; only the [[brainstem]], the portion of the brain responsible for [[autonomic function|autonomic]] and regulatory functions, such as the control of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], the [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] and [[blood pressure]], had developed during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/12/us/hospital-fights-parents-wish-to-keep-life-support-for-a-brain-dead-child.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm |title=Ruling in Virginia |location=Richmond |work=[[The New York Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=February 11, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; When baby Keene was admitted to the hospital at six months of age for severe respiratory problems, the hospital filed a legal motion to appoint a guardian for the child's care and sought a court order that the hospital did not need to provide any services beyond [[palliative care]]. At trial, several experts testified that providing ventilator support to an anencephalic infant (as Keene was) went beyond the accepted standard of medical care.&lt;ref name="4th Circuit"&gt;''Matter of Baby K.'', 16 [[Federal Reporter|F. 3d]] 590 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|4th Cir.]] 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the baby's mother argued her case on the grounds of religious freedom and the [[sanctity of life]]. In 1994, in a controversial ruling, the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] decided that the hospital caring for Keene must put her on a mechanical ventilator whenever she had trouble breathing. The court interpreted the [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] (EMTALA) to require continued ventilation for the infant. The wording of this act requires that patients who present with a [[medical emergency]] must get "such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition" before the patient is transferred to another facility. The court refused to take a [[morality|moral]] or [[ethics|ethical]] position on the issue, insisting that it was only interpreting the laws as they existed. As a result of the decision, Keene was kept alive much longer than most anencephalic babies. It has been suggested by the dissenting judge in the case that the court should have used the condition anencephaly as the basis of the case, not the recurring subsidiary symptoms of respiratory distress. As the irreversibility of anencephaly is widely understood in the medical community, he argued that the decision to continue futile care only resulted in the repetitive diversion of medical equipment.&lt;ref name="4th Circuit" /&gt;
* 1994 - 1998: [[Study 329]] was a [[clinical trial]] conducted in North America from 1994 to 1998 to study the efficacy of [[paroxetine]], an [[SSRI]] [[anti-depressant]], in treating 12- to 18-year-olds diagnosed with [[major depressive disorder]]. Led by [[Martin Keller (psychiatrist)|Martin Keller]], then professor of psychiatry at [[Brown University]], and funded by the British pharmaceutical company [[Beecham Group|SmithKline Beecham]]—known since 2000 as [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK)—the study compared paroxetine with [[imipramine]], a [[tricyclic antidepressant]], and [[placebo]] (an inert pill).&lt;ref name=Keller2001&gt;{{wikicite|ref=Keller2001|reference=[[Martin Keller (psychiatrist)|Keller, Martin B.]]; Ryan, Neal D.; Strober, Michael, et al.

The drug attracted sales of $11.7&amp;nbsp;billion in the United States alone from 1997 to 2006, including $2.12&amp;nbsp;billion in 2002, the year before it lost its [[Chemical patent|patent]]. Published in July 2001 in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]]'' (''JAACAP''), which listed Keller and 21 other researchers as co-authors, study 329 became controversial when it was discovered that the article had been [[Medical ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by a PR firm hired by SmithKline Beecham; had made inappropriate claims about the drug's efficacy; and had downplayed safety concerns. The controversy led to several lawsuits and strengthened calls for drug companies to disclose all their clinical research data.

* 1995 – The U.S. Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, ruled in ''[[Helen L. v. Snider]]'' that continued institutionalization of a disabled Pennsylvania woman, when not medically necessary and where there was the option of home care, was a violation of her rights under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] of 1990.  Disability rights advocates perceived this ruling as a landmark decision regarding the rights of people in nursing homes to personal assistance services.&lt;ref name="Timeline"/&gt;

* 1996 – ''Paralyzed Veterans of America v. Ellerbe Becket Architects and Engineers'', one of the first major [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] lawsuits, was focused on the wheelchair accessibility of a stadium project that was still in the design phase, [[MCI Center]] in Washington, D.C. Previous to this case, which was filed only five years after the ADA was passed, the DOJ was unable or unwilling to provide clarification on the distribution requirements for accessible wheelchair locations in large assembly spaces. While Section 4.33.3 of ADAAG makes reference to lines of sight, no specific reference is made to seeing over standing patrons. The MCI Center, designed by Ellerbe Becket Architects &amp; Engineers, was designed with too few wheelchair and companion seats, and the ones that were included did not provide sight lines that would enable the wheelchair user to view the playing area while the spectators in front of them were standing. This case and another related case established precedent on seat distribution and sight lines issues for ADA enforcement that continues to present day.
* 1996 – [[Not Dead Yet]] was formed by American disability rights advocates to oppose those who support assisted suicide for people with disabilities. It focuses on opposing rationing health care to people with severe disabilities and opposing the imposition of  “do not resuscitate” (DNR) orders for disabled people in hospitals, schools, and nursing homes.&lt;ref name="Timeline"/&gt;
* 1996 - ''[[Cooper v. Oklahoma]]'', 517 U.S. 348 (1996), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court reversed an Oklahoma court decision holding that a defendant is presumed to be competent to stand trial unless he proves otherwise by the second highest legal standard of proof, that of clear and convincing evidence, ruling that to be unconstitutional. The court said the defendant's Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process were violated.
* 1997 - ''[[Kansas v. Hendricks]]'', {{Ussc|521|346|1997|el=no}}, was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court set forth procedures for the indefinite [[civil commitment]] of prisoners convicted of a [[sex offense]] whom the state deems dangerous due to a mental abnormality.
* 1998 – The [[Veterans Programs Enhancement Act]] became law in the U.S., and it required a cost-of-living adjustment in rates of compensation paid to veterans with service-connected disabilities, as well as various improvements in education, housing, and cemetery programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h105-4110 |title= govtrack.us, a civic project to track &amp;#91;the U.S.&amp;#93; Congress, article title H.R. 4110: Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998|work=GovTrack.us |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1998 - ''[[Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal]]'', [[Case citation|523 U.S. 637]] (1998), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that {{usc|28|2244(b)}} did not apply to a petition that raises only a competency to be executed claim and that respondent did not, therefore, need authorization to file his petition in the District Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|523|637|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1998 – In ''[[Bragdon v.

* 1998 – In ''Jervon Lamont Herbin v. Commonwealth of Virginia'' (1998), Herbin appealed his convictions of malicious wounding, two counts of forcible sodomy, abduction, and attempted [[rape]].  The appeals court held that a "settled insanity" defense requires substantial evidence of not only long-term and heavy substance abuse, but convincing evidence of a mental disorder that is caused by long-term substance abuse. In ''Herbin'', the court found that&lt;blockquote&gt;"The weight of authority in this country recognizes an insanity defense that is based on a mental disease or defect produced by long-term substance abuse."  ''Commonwealth'' v. ''Herd'', 413 Mass. 834, 604 N.E.2d 1294, 1299 (1992).   At the same time, "evidence of mere narcotics addiction, standing alone and without other physiological or psychological involvement, raises no issue of such a mental defect or disease as can serve as a basis for the insanity defense."  ''United States'' v. ''Lyons'', 731 F.2d 243, 245 (5th Cir.1984) (citing cases).   Although appellant produced evidence of long-term and severe drug abuse, he did not present any evidence that he was suffering from any mental disease as a result of this drug abuse.   See ''Hooks'' v. ''State'', 534 So.2d 329, 353 (Ala.Crim.App.1987), ''aff'd sub nom''.  ''Ex parte Hooks'', 534 So.2d 371 (Ala.1988). - See more at: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://caselaw.findlaw.com/va-court-of-appeals/1349937.html#sthash.YduwJJE7.dpuf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Although Herbin did provide evidence of substantial drug abuse in the past, he was unable to provide expert witness testimony of any mental disorder. The court held that the substance abuse did not serve as evidence for a "settled insanity" defense alone without the link to a mental disorder. No lay witnesses testified as to any behavior consistent with insanity, even if lay testimony were admissible to establish the insanity defense in Virginia. Also, although Herbin did provide an extensive history of drug and sexual abuse,  the court said no evidence showed either of these issues were causes or results of a mental disorder. Therefore, the appeals court upheld his conviction.&lt;ref name="jervon"&gt;{{cite web

* 1999 - The [[Texas]] Advance Directives Act (1999), also known as the [[Texas Futile Care Law]], describes certain provisions that are now Chapter 166 of the Texas Health &amp; Safety Code. Controversy over these provisions mainly centers on Section 166.046, Subsection (e),{{ref|Sect 166|1}} which allows a health care facility to discontinue life-sustaining treatment ten days after giving written notice if the continuation of life-sustaining treatment is considered [[futile care]] by the treating medical team. Although it is often stated that the act is officially named as the 'Futile Care Law' or the 'Futile Care Act', that is in fact incorrect and the statute has never legally had that title.
* 1999 – ''Barden v. The City of Sacramento'', filed in March 1999, claimed that the City of Sacramento failed to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act when, while making public street improvements, it did not bring its sidewalks into compliance with the ADA. Certain issues were resolved in Federal Court. One issue, whether sidewalks were covered by the ADA, was appealed to the [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]], which ruled that sidewalks were a "program" under ADA and must be made accessible to persons with disabilities. The ruling was later appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case, letting stand the ruling of the 9th Circuit Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dralegal.org/cases/public_entities/barden_v_sacramento.php Barden v.

* 1999 – ''Bates v. UPS'' (begun in 1999) was the first [[equal opportunity employment]] class action brought on behalf of deaf and hard of hearing  workers throughout the country concerning workplace discrimination. It established legal precedence for deaf and hard of hearing employees and customers to be fully covered under the ADA. Key findings included
# UPS failed to address communication barriers and to ensure equal conditions and opportunities for deaf employees;
# Deaf employees were routinely excluded from workplace information, denied opportunities for promotion, and exposed to unsafe conditions due to lack of accommodations by UPS;
# UPS also lacked a system to alert these employees as to emergencies, such as fires or chemical spills, to ensure that they would safely evacuate their facility; and
# UPS had no policy to ensure that deaf applicants and employees actually received effective communication in the workplace.
The outcome was that UPS agreed to pay a $5.8 million award and agreed to a comprehensive accommodations program that was implemented in their facilities throughout the country.

Some opponents contended that its objectives are to foster chemical [[behavior]] control of American citizens. However, no commission recommendations specifically called for increased drug use and the commission did call for closer scrutiny of psychiatric drug treatment, months before the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) started taking these steps in the wake of reports of increased rates of [[suicide]], especially during the first months of drug use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Executive Summary: Emergency Response — A Roadmap for Federal Action on America's Mental Health Crisis  |date=July 2005 |website=The Campaign for Mental Health Reform |url=http://www.mhreform.org/emergency/emergencyresponse_execsummary.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050731015355/http://www.mhreform.org/emergency/emergencyresponse_execsummary.htm |archive-date=July 31, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social Security Administration]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a 6-year-old American boy who became the center of a legal battle between his parents, Steve and Gayle Koochin, and [[Primary Children's Medical Center]] in [[Salt Lake City]]. On September 15, 2004, Jesse developed respiratory problems and was taken to Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City and placed on a ventilator. On October 8, "his tumor pushed his [[brainstem|brain stem]] down through the skull," and he was in an unresponsive coma. Subsequently, two physicians independently examined him on October 11 and 12  and determined that the child was [[brain dead]]. The hospital informed his parents that they would order life support removed within 24 hours. However, the Koochins rejected the hospital's definition of death. Instead, relying on traditional notions of cardiopulmonary death, they filed for an immediate restraining order to keep Koochin on a ventilator and to receive other treatment. They declared that he had been in a "similar coma" from May 23, 2004 to July 11, 2004 and had successfully awakened, and also claimed that the hospital staff did not perform an [[EEG]] exam or cerebral perfusion study to test for brain activity. The Utah judge granted the restraining order on October 13 and ruled that the hospital would be allowed to declare him brain dead without performing the two tests. On October 15, the parents removed the brain-dead child from the hospital and put him under hospice care at their temporary home in Salt Lake City. Koochin's heart ultimately stopped beating on November 19, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,595106792,00.html |title=Jesse loses his battle with brain tumor |publisher=Deseret News |date=2004-11-19 |first=Lois M. |last=Collins |first2=Linda |last2=Thomson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landmark case was the first documented instance in the United States in which parents attempted to opt out of legally accepted standards of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/national/27death.html |last=Belluck |first=Pam |title=Even as Doctors Say Enough, Families Fight to Prolong Life |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2004 – In ''[[Tennessee v. Lane]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] did not violate the sovereign immunity doctrine of the 11th Amendment when, based on Congress's 14th Amendment enforcement powers of the Due Process clause, it allowed individuals to sue states for denying them services based on their disabilities. The Court held that Congress had sufficiently demonstrated the problems faced by disabled persons who sought to exercise fundamental rights protected by the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment (such as access to a court). The Court also emphasized that the remedies required from the states were not unreasonable&amp;nbsp;– they just had to make reasonable accommodations to allow disabled persons to exercise their fundamental rights. The Court thus held that because Title II of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] was a "reasonable prophylactic measure, reasonably targeted to a legitimate end," and because Congress had the authority under the 14th Amendment to regulate the actions of the states to accomplish that end, the law was constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2003/2003_02_1667 |title= Tennessee v.

* 2005 - The [[Terri Schiavo case]] was a [[right-to-die]] legal case in the [[United States]] from 1990 to 2005, involving Theresa Marie "Terri" Schiavo (December 3, 1963 – March 31, 2005), a woman in an irreversible [[persistent vegetative state]]. Schiavo's husband and legal guardian argued that Schiavo would not have wanted prolonged artificial life support without the prospect of recovery, and elected to remove her [[feeding tube]]. Schiavo's parents disputed her husband's assertions and challenged Schiavo's medical diagnosis, arguing in favor of continuing artificial nutrition and hydration. The highly publicized and prolonged series of legal challenges presented by her parents, which ultimately involved state and federal politicians up to the level of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]], caused a seven-year delay before Schiavo's feeding tube was ultimately removed in 2005, after which she died that same year.

* 2005 – In ''[[Campbell v. General Dynamics Gov't Sys. Corp.]],'' the First Circuit Court of the U.S. had to consider the enforceability of a mandatory arbitration agreement, contained in a dispute resolution policy linked to an e-mailed company-wide announcement, insofar as it applied to employment discrimination claims brought under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]]. Under the Court's analysis, the question turned on whether the employer provided minimally sufficient notice of the contractual nature of the e-mailed policy and of the concomitant waiver of an employee's right to access a judicial forum.  The Court weighed the attendant circumstances and concluded that the notice was wanting and that, therefore, enforcement of the waiver would be inappropriate; thus the Court upheld the district court's denial of the employer's motion to stay proceedings and compel the employee to submit his claim to arbitration.

* 2005 - On November 14, 2005, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Schaffer v. Weast]]'', 546 U.S. 49, that it is the party which requests a hearing under the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] who has the burden of proof in such an action.

* 2005 - [[Spiro Nikolouzos]] was a Texas man incapacitated from bleeding related to a [[cerebral shunt]], whose care was the subject of an appeal of The [[Texas Futile Care Law]]. Nikolouzos was hospitalized on February 10, 2005, at [[St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital]], [[Houston, Texas]], and was in a [[persistent vegetative state]]. He was fed through a [[gastric feeding tube]] and respirated by a [[ventilator]]. The [[hospital]] wished to discontinue [[life support]], allowing Nikolouzos to die. His family opposed this action and claimed the hospital's decision was related to the fact that Nikolouzos's [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] funding was running out, a contention denied by the hospital. Under the 1999 [[Advance Directives Act]] (also known as The [[Texas Futile Care Law]]), the hospital may override the family's wishes in such a matter should an [[Institutional Review Board|ethics committee]] clear such an action. However, Nikolouzos's family won an emergency [[injunction]] preventing the removal of the life support apparatus, and on March 21, 2005, Spiro Nikolouzos was removed to [[Avalon Place]] [[nursing home|Nursing Home]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Avalon Place had rejected his application nine days earlier. Nikolouzos subsequently died at Avalon on May 30, 2005. The precedent set by the case of [[Sun Hudson]] may have helped to expedite the removal of Nikolouzos from artificial respiration prior to the move.
* 2005 - In ''[[Bigby v. Dretke]]'' 402 F.3d 551 (5th Cir. 2005), the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]]  struck down [[jury instructions]] in death penalty cases that do not ask about [[mitigating factor]]s including a consideration of the [[defendant]]'s social, medical, and psychological history, saying that the jury must be instructed to consider mitigating factors even when answering unrelated questions. This ruling suggests that an expanded explanation including these factors be given in the jury instructions to insure the jury weighs all the mitigating factors. This ruling also established that a defendant's mental disorder must be considered as a mitigating factor in sentencing in a death penalty case, even if mental illness was not brought up in the trial.&lt;ref name="jaapl"&gt;{{cite journal

In July 2004, Ashley had a [[hysterectomy]] (to prevent [[menstruation]]) and surgical removal of her [[thelarche|nascent breast buds]] (to prevent development). She also underwent an [[appendectomy]]. The surgery was performed at [[Seattle]]'s [[Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center (Seattle)|Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center]]. In addition, in December 2006 she completed [[Hormone therapy|estrogen therapy]] through dermal patches, which sped up the natural closure of her [[growth plates]].

* 2007 - ''[[Panetti v. Quarterman]]'', 551 U.S. 930 (2007), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, ruling that criminal defendants sentenced to death may not be executed if they do not understand the reason for their imminent execution, and that once the state has set an execution date death-row inmates may litigate their [[Competency evaluation (law)|competency]] to be executed in ''[[habeas corpus]]'' proceedings.

Under the Appellate Court's interpretation of the statute, a court located in the District of Columbia, must apply the "best interest of the patient" standard to a person who was never competent, and the court must apply the "known wishes of the patient" standard to a person who was once competent. The appellate decision was [[Remand (court procedure)|remanded]] back to the District Court.
* 2007 – ''Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America v. The University of Michigan'', begun in 2007, was a case filed before The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division on behalf of the Michigan [[Paralyzed Veterans of America]] against University of Michigan – Michigan Stadium claiming that [[Michigan Stadium]] violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in its $226-million renovation by failing to add enough seats for disabled fans or accommodate the needs for disabled restrooms, concessions and parking. Additionally, the distribution of the accessible seating was at issue, with nearly all the seats being provided in the end-zone areas. The suit was settled in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Erb, Robin. "U-M fans rave about new seats for disabled," Detroit Free Press. 9 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement required the stadium to add 329 wheelchair seats throughout the stadium by 2010, and an additional 135 accessible seats in clubhouses to go along with the existing 88 wheelchair seats. This case was significant because it set a precedent for the uniform distribution of accessible seating and gave the DOJ the opportunity to clarify previously unclear rules.&lt;ref name=wolffe&gt;Wolffe, Jerry.

* 2008 - The [[Illinois Appellate Court]] held that in determining a petition for the sterilization of an incompetent ward, a court should apply the substituted consent standard if there is clear and convincing evidence regarding how the ward would decide if the ward were competent; however, the court should apply the best interest of the patient standard if the ward's substituted judgment cannot be proven by clear and convincing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Illinois Appellate Court | title= In re Estate of K.E.J., 382 Ill.App.3d 401 (2008). | access-date=June 13, 2016 | url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/20081591887NE2d704_11567/IN%20RE%20ESTATE%20OF%20K.E.J.  | quote=First, the party seeking sterilization may demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the ward, if competent, would have wished to be sterilized and would not have objected to the chosen method of sterilization. If the party seeking sterilization can meet this burden after all procedures have been followed and all relevant evidence has been taken into account, then the court may issue an order authorizing sterilization of the ward. The party opposing sterilization can attempt to produce clear and convincing evidence that if the ward were competent, she either (1) would not have wished to be sterilized if she could have foreseen her current situation, or (2) would not have consented to the chosen method of sterilization. If either of these things can be demonstrated, then following the substituted judgment standard provided for in the Probate Act, the ward’s wishes prevail and the court should deny the petition for sterilization. No analysis of the ward’s best interests is necessary under either of these scenarios. However, if the ward’s substituted judgment cannot be proved by clear and convincing evidence either way, then the Probate Act instructs us to proceed to a best interests analysis, following the six Terwilliger factors outlined above. As discussed, the petition for sterilization should be granted if and only if the proponent of the petition can prove it is in the ward’s best interests by clear and convincing evidence, when compared to other, less intrusive alternatives currently available to the ward, as well as potential future alternatives that may become available due to scientific or medical advances.  If the court concludes, after analysis of all the above factors, that sterilization by the petitioned-for method is proven to be in the ward’s best interests by clear and convincing evidence, then a petition authorizing the procedure may issue. Otherwise, the petition must be denied.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2008 – The [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA) Amendments Act of 2008 became law, and it broadened the scope of who is considered disabled under the law, and when considering whether a person is disabled, the law required that people ignore the beneficial effects of any mitigating measures (except ordinary eyeglasses and contact lenses) the person uses; furthermore, when considering whether a person is substantially limited in a major life activity, which would make them disabled under the law, the law required the consideration of bodily functions as well as other major life activities, and having one major life activity substantially limited is enough; when considering whether a person whose condition is episodic or in remission is substantially limited in a major life activity, the law required the consideration of the person's limitations as they are when the condition is in an active state; furthermore, determining someone is disabled under the law does not require individuals to meet the substantially-limited-in-a-major-life-activity standard, but does not include impairments that are transitory and minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://askjan.org/bulletins/adaaa1.htm |title= Accommodation Ideas|author=JAN Web Team|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2008 – The [[Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act]] became law in the U.S., and it required that if a group health plan includes medical/surgical benefits and MH/SUD (mental health/substance abuse) benefits, the financial requirements (e.g., deductibles and co-payments) and treatment limitations (e.g., number of visits or days of coverage) that apply to MH/SUD benefits must be no more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements or treatment limitations that apply to substantially all medical/surgical benefits; MH/SUD benefits may not be subject to any separate cost-sharing requirements or treatment limitations that only apply to such benefits; if a group health plan includes medical/surgical benefits and MH/SUD benefits, and the plan provides for out-of-network medical/surgical benefits, it must provide for out-of-network MH/SUD benefits; and standards for medical necessity determinations and reasons for any denial of benefits relating to MH/SUD benefits must be disclosed upon request.

* 2011 - The [[Joseph Maraachli case]] refers to an international controversy over the life of Joseph Maraachli, commonly known as Baby Joseph, a Canadian infant who was diagnosed with a rare progressive and incurable [[neurological disorder]] called [[Leigh's disease]]. After Canadian doctors refused to perform a [[tracheotomy]], calling the procedure invasive and futile, Joseph's parents fought to have him transferred to the [[United States]], arguing that while Joseph's disease was terminal, a tracheotomy would extend his life and allow him to die at home. After several months and efforts by American [[pro-life]] groups, Joseph was transferred to a Catholic hospital in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], where the procedure was performed in 2011. The successfully-obtained procedure extended Joseph's life for several months.

* 2011 – On March 15, 2011, new [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] rules came into effect. These rules expanded accessibility requirements for recreational facilities such as swimming pools, golf courses, exercise clubs, and boating facilities. They also set standards for the use of wheelchairs and other mobility devices like Segways in public spaces, and changed the standards for things such as selling tickets to events and reserving accessible hotel rooms. The new rules also clearly defined “service animal” as “...any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability.” This portion of the law also states that the services the service animal provides must be “directly related to the handler’s disability” and dogs that provide only emotional support or crime deterrence cannot be defined as service animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abilitymagazine.com/New-ADA-Rules-Go-Into-Effect.html |title= Ability Magazine, article title New ADA Rules Go Into Effect|publisher= |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2011 - In May 2011 [[ADAPT]] organized a protest in Washington, D. C. against changes to Medicaid as part of US Representative [[Paul Ryan]]'s budget proposal that would have cut Medicaid funding and given more control of the program to the states. Around 100 disability protesters were arrested in D.C., and similar protests led by local ADAPT groups were later held in Chicago, Philadelphia, and Minnesota. Throughout these protests, ADAPT used their Twitter and Facebook feeds to share photos and links to media coverage of the event, which included images of protesters being arrested, to gain and mobilize support from the broader community.

* 2012 – Gov. [[Andrew Cuomo]] and legislative leaders reached a deal to create a new state agency, the Justice Center for the Protection of People With Special Needs, to police abuse and neglect of more than one million New Yorkers with developmental disabilities, mental illnesses and other conditions that put them at risk. Lawmakers also agreed to expand the state’s public disclosure law, requiring thousands of nonprofit groups that provide services to disabled and mentally ill people to make records of abuse and neglect public. The reforms were based on a report by Clarence J. Sundram, Special Advisor to the Governor on Vulnerable Persons, entitled "The Measure of a Society:Protection of Vulnerable Persons in Residential Facilities Against Abuse and Neglect." Some disability activists supported this reform, but others disapproved because they thought investigations should be referred to outside police agencies, not the state. An independent nonprofit group is also being set up to lobby for policy changes for people with disabilities. The group will get powers to conduct its own investigations after complaints and to review documents connected to particular allegations, and that authority is detailed in state law. It will also be given access to group homes and state institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/18/nyregion/deal-in-albany-on-policing-abuse-of-disabled.html |title= Deal in Albany on Policing Abuse of Disabled|publisher=nytimes.com |date=  |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2012 - On December 17, 2012, the United States of America filed a lawsuit in the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon]] under the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994]], {{usc|42|14141}} against the City of Portland, alleging improper use-of-force by the [[Portland Police Bureau]] against members of a protected class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Department of Justice v.

Based on findings of more than a year of investigation, the complaint alleged Portland police officers engaged in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional use of force against individuals with actual or perceived mental illness. Specifically, the DOJ claimed: (1) Portland police encounters with such individuals too frequently resulted in a higher level force than necessary; (2) Portland police employed [[Tasers]] more times than necessary on such individuals, or in circumstances where such force was not justified; and (3) Portland police used a higher degree of force than justified for low level offenses. The case based on this claim, ''[[United States v. City of Portland]]'', is notable because of its finding persons with mental illness are primary recipients of police use-of-force.

* 2012 –  A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit affirmed that school districts should reimburse parents for independent educational evaluations of students with disabilities, at least in some cases.

* 2013 – The U.S. Department of Education issued a mandate requiring schools to provide sports for children with disabilities. Specifically, students with disabilities who want to compete in sports for their school can join traditional teams if officials can make "reasonable modifications" to accommodate them. If those adjustments would fundamentally alter a sport or give the student an advantage, the department says schools must create parallel athletic programs that have comparable standing to traditional programs.&lt;ref name="sports"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.valleymorningstar.com/news/local_news/article_296b976a-6836-11e2-b7d7-0019bb30f31a.html |title= Disabled students now enjoy sports after mandate|publisher= www.valleymorningstar.com |date=January 26, 2013 |accessdate=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the revised policies, agencies became able to hire after determining that the person is “likely to succeed” in performing the duties of the position, a decision that can be based on any relevant work, educational, or other experience.

* 2013 – Airline website pages which have core travel information and services must be accessible to the disabled within two years, the Department of Transportation said, and all pages on airline websites must within three years be readily available to people with disabilities. The new regulations also required airline ticket agents to disclose — and offer — web-based discount fares to customers unable to use their sites due to a disability. Airlines already were required to provide equivalent service for consumers who were unable to use inaccessible websites. Airlines and airports were also required by the new regulations to have to make accessible to the disabled automated kiosks providing boarding passes and baggage tags, as they purchased new equipment. If no new kiosks were installed, 25 percent of the kiosks at each airport location in 2013 were required to be accessible within 10 years. Another new rule gave airlines more flexibility in how they transported manual, folding wheelchairs onboard, making it possible for them to carry up to two wheelchairs in the cabin. In addition to being able to stow a wheelchair in a closet, airlines were also allowed under the new regulations to strap a second chair across a row of seats.

* 2014 - [[Death of Marlise Muñoz|Marlise Nicole Muñoz]] was an American woman at the center of a medical ethics controversy between November 2013 and January 2014.

{{Main article|Race and ethnicity in Brazil}}

The Brazilian concept of "white race" might be somewhat different from the concept of "white race" in other countries since race is seen in a spectrum, with different races being perceived as assorted series of continua, but the same concepts can be found in other New World countries or former European colonies like Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hanchard, editor's "Introduction" to ''Racial Politics in Contemporary Brazil'' (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1999; {{ISBN|0-8223-2272-2}}).&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive study presented by the ''Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research'' found that on average, white Brazilians are (&gt;83%) European.&lt;ref name="scielo.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-879X2009005000026&amp;script=sci_arttext#Abstract |title=Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research - DNA tests probe the genomic ancestry of Brazilians |website=Scielo.br |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another autosomal study carried out by the geneticist Sergio Pena showed that the overwhelming ancestry of "white" Brazilians is European.&lt;ref name="scielo.br"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/news/2009/11/091102_brazil_black_ap.shtml |title=BBC World Service - News - Black in Brazil: a question of identity |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=2009-11-03 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another autosomal DNA study (from 2009) conducted on a school in the poor periphery of Rio de Janeiro the "whites" from a sample of just 90 students (who thought of themselves as "very mixed") were found to carry very little Amerindian or African admixtures (generally about 90% European in ancestry on average). "The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self-made estimates of European ancestry", say the researchers. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than those students had thought it would be. The "pardos" were found to have a European ancestry on average of 80% (autosomal ancestry)&lt;ref name="meionews.com.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meionews.com.br/index.php/noticias/21-estado-do-rio/4607-negros-e-pardos-do-rio-tem-mais-genes-europeus-do-que-imaginam-segundo-estudo.html |title=Negros e pardos do Rio têm mais genes europeus do que imaginam, segundo estudo |website=Meionews.com.br |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706153557/http://www.meionews.com.br/index.php/noticias/21-estado-do-rio/4607-negros-e-pardos-do-rio-tem-mais-genes-europeus-do-que-imaginam-segundo-estudo.html |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www4.ensp.fiocruz.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.ensp.fiocruz.br/informe/anexos/ric.pdf|title=502 Bad Gateway|date=30 December 2016|accessdate=19 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this study, a random sample of 90 students, 30 of whom had classified themselves as white, 30 as brown, and 20 as black, although important in understanding racial categorizations in Brazil in no way represents the genetic makeup of the entire population of this nation that is the fifth largest in the world by territory and whose different regions were populated by different ethnic groups during different historical periods.

The degree of [[miscegenation]] in Brazil varies according to region, being particularly high in the Northeast region, the first to receive large European waves during the colonial period; Brazil was originally colonised only by a few families of Portuguese settlers in the first decades of the 16th century, with some French families included; instead there were many mostly Portuguese individual male adventurers, who tended to reproduce with Amerindian females at first and later with African females, even though the Crown had sent female orphans under royal custody during the colonial period to marry Portuguese male settlers; with noblemen marrying the ones whose fathers had died serving abroad in the military especially in Asian colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ronald M.

According to a genealogical and demographic study carried out by the sociologist Mario Jaramillo e Contreras, member of the Junta Directiva de la Real Asociación de Hidalgos de España, a non-profitable apolitical organization, over 15% of Latin Americans today descend from Iberian nobles who migrated to the Americas during the colonial period after the conceptual three "G"s, gold, God and glory, meaning financial success and military fame and renown, besides bringing new converted souls to the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2016/08/mais-do-10-da-populacao-latino-americana-descende-de-nobres.html|title=Over 15% of the population in Latin America today can trace back their ancestry to Iberian and other European nobles|website=g1.globo.com |date=2016-08-06|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, social prejudice connected to certain details in the physical appearance of individual is widespread. Those details are related to the concept of "cor". "Cor", [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "color" denotes the Brazilian rough equivalent of the term "race" in English, but is based on a complex phenotypic evaluation that takes into account skin pigmentation, hair type, nose shape, and lip shape. This concept, unlike the English notion of "race", captures the continuous aspects of phenotypes. Thus, it seems there is no racial descent rule operational in Brazil; it is even possible for two siblings to belong to completely diverse "racial" categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=140919|pmid=12509516 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0126614100|volume=100|issue=1|title=Color and genomic ancestry in Brazilians|date=January 2003|pages=177–82|last1=Parra|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}} Second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;
Although in the most recent census, with the increased valorisation of indigenous, mixed, black, anusim and gipsy or romani heritage thanks to affirmative action, large numbers of mixed mestizo, castizo, eurasians or mixed white + black, as well as black Brazilians selected '''black''' and '''mixed''' even with higher socioeconomic status, who probably would've selected '''white''' or '''mixed''' in the 2000 Census, thus giving a clearer picture on Brazil's demographic makeup.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/17/brazil-census-african-brazilians-majority |title=Brazil census shows African-Brazilians and Mestizos in the majority for the first time &amp;#124; World news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding the new consciousness, the fact that the fertility rate in Brazil has dropped considerably in the last decades, especially among European descendants, Jews, Levantines and Japanese-Brazilians reaching below replacement rates can also be counted as an additional factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/08/world/brazil-welcomes-drop-in-population-growth.html|title=Brazil welcomes drop in population growth|website=nytimes.com |date=1992-03-08|accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/world/fertility-rate-plummets-in-brazil/2011/12/23/gIQAsOXWPP_story.html|title=Fertility rate plummets in Brazil|website=Washingtonpost.com |date=2011-12-29|accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are the results for the different Brazilian censuses, since 1872:

{{Race and ethnicity in Brazil}}

In the past, ancestry was quite irrelevant for racial classifications in Brazil. A survey in [[Rio de Janeiro]] also concluded that "racial-purity" is not important for a person to be classified as white in Brazil. The survey asked respondents if they had any ancestors who were European, African or Amerindian. As much as 52% of those whites reported they have some non-European ancestry: 23% reported to have some Black African ancestry and 29% reported Amerindian ancestry (15% of them reported to have both). Only 56% of those whites did not report any nonwhite ancestry. Thus, in Brazil, one can self-identify as white and still have African or Amerindian ancestry, and such a person has no problem admitting to having nonwhite ancestors.&lt;ref name=Telles/&gt;
The most recent census in 2010, showed a shift in mentality, where mixed Brazilians whose DNA might have European markers in a range spanning from 70% to 85%, overwhelmingly chose to identify with their mixed racial background, rather than white. These backgrounds being predominantly [[Caboclo]] or [[mestiço]], known in the Spanish-speaking world as [[Mestizo]] and [[Castizo]] for the most part, but also black and white mix, or black plus Native plus white, what in the past was known as [[Octoroon]], as well as [[Romani people|Romani]] or Gipsy, [[Anusim]] or Dutch and Lusitanian Crypto Jew, and [[Eurasian]] or [[Hāfu]] and ainoko.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt; Affirmative action and identity valorisation being factors, albeit fertility rate among European ancestry, Levantine and Jewish citizens plummeting being another factor part of the equation.

Given this ambiguity and fluidity, there are people who claim that the few racial categories offered by the IBGE are not enough. When Brazilians answer to open-ended questions about race, up to 143 different race-color terms are brought. The most common is "moreno", a category that refers to a wide spectrum of phenotypes. It can mean "dark-haired", "tawny", "suntanned", but it is also used as a euphemism for "pardo" and "black", according to context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dicionariodoaurelio.com/dicionario.php?P=Moreno |title=Aurélio dictionary definition for "moreno" |website=Dicionariodoaurelio.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a synonym with "pardo", however, since each word refers to widely different sets of people.

An important factor about whiteness in Brazil is the racial stigma of being Amerindian or black, which is undesirable and avoided for a large part of the population. [[Scientific racism]] largely influenced race relations in Brazil since the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=Telles/&gt; The predominant nonwhite, mostly Afro-Brazilian population was seen as a problem for Brazil in the eyes of the predominantly white elite of the country. In contrast to some countries, like the United States or South Africa, which tried to avoid miscegenation, even imposing [[anti-miscegenation law]]s, in Brazil, miscegenation was always legal. What was expected was that miscegenation would eventually turn all Brazilians into whites.&lt;ref name=Telles/&gt;

As a result of that desire of whitening its own population, the Brazilian ruling classes encouraged the arrival of massive European immigration to the country. In the 1890s 1.2&amp;nbsp;million European immigrants were added to the country's 5&amp;nbsp;million whites. Today the Brazilian areas with larger proportions of whites tend to have been destinations of massive European immigration between 1880 and 1930.&lt;ref name=Telles/&gt;

Even though expectations of the Brazilian elite to whiten its own population through European immigration came to an end in the 1930s, the whitening ideology still influences racial relations in Brazil today. In general, the population still expects that blacks must biologically whiten themselves by marriage with lighter skinned people, or culturally through the assimilation of the traditions of the dominant white population.&lt;ref name=Telles/&gt; That leads mixed-race people to be perceived as whites,&lt;ref name=Telles/&gt; and this is more evident when a nonwhite person becomes wealthier and is incorporated in the ruling classes.

For example, Brazilian writer, [[Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis]], was a mulatto. However, once he gained fame and prestige, people started to accept him as a white man, and on his [[death certificate]] he was classified as a "white man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vetoradm.com.br/questoesnegras/relac3.htm|title=Questões Negras|date=9 September 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=19 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909173725/http://vetoradm.com.br/questoesnegras/relac3.htm|archivedate=9 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Better educated and wealthier Brazilians usually see themselves as whites (a strict association between wealth and whiteness).&lt;ref name=Telles/&gt; A study&lt;ref name=Telles/&gt; showed that when mixed-race Brazilians get wealthier they start to be perceived as whites by others, who usually avoid associating a wealthy person with a non-white racial category. But only mixed-race people can "become white" when they get richer, while typically black people will always be perceived as blacks, no matter how rich they get.&lt;ref name=Telles/&gt;

It showed that less educated black Brazilians avoid being associated as Black (usually choosing the word "Moreno": literally "tanned", "brunette", "with an olive complexion"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dicionariodoaurelio.com/dicionario.php?P=Moreno |title=Aurélio dictionary definition of Moreno |website=Dicionariodoaurelio.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}} to classify themselves). Better-educated black Brazilians, however, are more than eight times more likely as persons of a low level of education to identify themselves as blacks, while better educated mixed-race people usually jump to the white category.&lt;ref name=Telles/&gt; Research published by the American Sociological Review found that the growth of the [[pardo]] population would be in part due to large numbers of [[black people|blacks]] "whitening" themselves by reporting to be brown (mulatto). Studies have found a large trend in reclassification (whitening) from black to brown in the 1950 to 1980 period, a much smaller one from white to [[pardo]], and a similar but less pronounced pattern between 1980 and 1990. Academics attribute this switch from black to [[pardo]] to high rates of black upward mobility during the 1970s, consistent with a "money whitens" hypothesis, that is [[black people|blacks]] would whiten themselves by reporting as [[pardo]] the more wealthy they become. These results would demonstrate a tendency for what is called branqueamento, that means that [[black people|blacks]] would tend to self-classify as whiter. In this case, differences found in the share of blacks between census results would demonstrate that [[black people|blacks]] tend to self-classify as [[pardo]]s. Some researchers suggested to merge the two into a single [[Afro-Brazilian]] category (e.g., Lovell 1994; Wood and Carvalho 1988; Wood and Lovell 1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Luisa Farah Schwartzman |url=http://asr.sagepub.com/content/72/6/940.abstract |title=Does Money Whiten?

The integration of races in Brazil did not build a [[racial democracy]], where [[racism]] would not exist because all Brazilians saw themselves as equal because of their common [[multiracial]] heritage. Even though this theory was dominant in Brazil for decades, although it is still followed by some today, most scholars now think that miscegenation in Brazil created not an egalitarian society{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} but a society where lighter-skinned people are found mostly on the top and the darker-skinned are mostly found on the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/portuguese/reporterbbc/story/2007/08/070626_dna_miscigenacao_cg.shtml |title=Miscigenação não leva à democracia racial, diz sociólogo |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|left|The First Mass in Brazil, held by Portuguese settlers in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]].]]
Brazil received more European settlers during its colonial era than any other country in the Americas. Between 1500 and 1760, about 700,000 Europeans immigrated to Brazil, compared to 530,000 European immigrants in the United States.&lt;ref name="ibge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/portugueses.html|title=IBGE teen|date=24 February 2013|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=19 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224012534/http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/portugueses.html|archivedate=24 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[History of Immigration to the United States#Population in 1790]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Practically all Europeans coming to Brazil before 1818 were Portuguese. Available data seems to point that most Portuguese settlers in Brazil came from northern Portugal, especially from [[Minho (province)|Minho]] (in 1801, 45% of the Portuguese established in São Paulo were "minhotos", 20% from the [[Azores Islands]], 16% from [[Lisbon]] and 19% from other parts&lt;ref&gt;Florentino, Manolo, and Machado, Cacilda. [http://www.trentu.ca/admin/publications/psr/sample/1012.pdf Ensaio sobre a imigração portuguesa e os padrões de miscigenação no Brasil (séculos XIX e XX) - 2002 - Portugueses, (PDF file)]&lt;/ref&gt;). Another significant portion came from the Portuguese Atlantic Island of Madeira.

An important feature of the Portuguese colonization was the overwhelming predominance of males. This disproportion was a problem during much of the colonial period. The Portuguese Crown even sent [[orphaned]] women under royal wardship for marriage with the settlers known as [[Órfãs d'El-Rei]],{{sfnp|Telfer|1932|p=184}}{{sfnp|Bethell|1984|p=47}}&lt;ref name="ensinarhistoria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensinarhistoriajoelza.com.br/desmundo-o-brasil-do-sec-xvi/|title=Desmundo de Alain Fresnot, o Brasil no século XVI|website=Ensinarhistoriajoelza.com.br|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companhiadasletras.com.br/detalhe.php?codigo=10637|title=Desmundo by Ana Miranda (1996)|website=Companhiadasletras.com.br|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a large part of the settlers were involved in relationships with indigenous women and African [[slave]]s. It is remarkable that most Portuguese settlers arrived in Brazil in the 18th century: 600,000 in a period of only 60 years. The exploitation of gold and diamonds in the region of [[Minas Gerais]] has been a crucial factor in the arrival of this contingent of colonists.&lt;ref name="ibge"/&gt;

===New Christians===
The "New Christians" was a term used to refer to Portuguese Jews who converted to Roman Catholicism, and their known baptized descendants. Portugal has always had a sizable Jewish community inhabiting its territory. There was a healthy degree of acceptance and tolerance towards Jewish religion, language and culture. However, after the inquisition set a foothold in Spain about 120.000 Jews fled to Portugal where King John II sold them a residency. Five years later, as the Inquisition gained momentum in Portugal, all people of Jewish ancestry were forced to be baptized and became the New Christians. Many moved from Portugal and established themselves in Brazil. Some of the most common Portuguese New Christian surnames were: Cardozo, Pereira, Henriques, Pimentel, Silva, Oliveira, Machado, Tavares, Lima, Mascarenhas, Nogueira, Pinto, Coutinho, Rodrigues, Mendes, Teixeira, Nunes, Pacheco, Dias, Alvares, Fernándes, Furtado, Sousa, Castro, Morais, Miranda, Ribeiro, Noronha, Vasconcelos, etc. According to researcher Flávio Mendes de Carvalho in his book The Jewish Roots of Brazil, between 25% and 35% of the Brazilian population descends from these New Christians, which is the equivalent of 66&amp;nbsp;million people.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Before the 19th century, the French invaded twice, establishing brief and minor settlements ([[Rio de Janeiro]], 1555–60; [[Maranhão]], 1612–15);&lt;ref name="gaffarel"&gt;Paul Louis Jacques Gaffarel, ''Histoire du Brésil français au seizième siècle'' (Paris: Maison Neuve, 1878).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1630, the Dutch made the most significant attempt to seize Brazil from Portuguese control. At the time, Portugal was in a dynastic union with Spain, and the Dutch hostility against Spain was transferred to Portugal. The Dutch were able to control most of the Brazilian Northeast{{snd}} then the most dynamic part of Brazil{{snd}} for about a quarter century, but were unable to change the ethnic makeup of the colonizing population, which remained overwhelmingly Portuguese by origin and culture.&lt;ref name="postma18"&gt;{{cite book |author=Johannes Menne Postma |title=The Dutch in the Atlantic slave trade, 1600–1815 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1990 |isbn= 0-521-36585-6 | pages= 18–20 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=dzI8C0Vka7IC |page=18 }} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sephardic Jews of Portuguese origin moved from Amsterdam to [[Dutch Brazil|New Holland]];&lt;ref name="postma18" /&gt; but in 1654, when the Portuguese regained control of Brazil, most of them were expelled, as well as most of the Dutch settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Beth Capelache de Carvalho |title=Histórias e lendas de santos: os imigrantes: A colônia judaica (1)", ''A Tribuna'' de Santos, 27 June 1982 |url=http://www.novomilenio.inf.br/santos/h0150c.htm |accessdate= 2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of Dutch and Portuguese Jews then moved to North America, forming a Jewish community in [[New Amsterdam]], today's New York city, while a few of the Dutch colonists settled in the highlands in the countryside of Pernambuco known as [[Borborema Plateau]], a region part of the ecosystem known as ''[[agreste]]'' between the coastal forest ''[[Zona da Mata (coastal)|zona da mata]]'' and the semiarid ''[[sertão]]'' in the Northeast.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Brazil.html|title=Brazil Virtual Jewish History Tour|website=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_16538.html|title=Recife, Brazil|website=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Dutch colonialism in Brazil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colonialvoyage.com/dutch-in-brazil/|title=The Dutch colonialism in Brazil|website=Colonialvoyage.com|date= |accessdate=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bneianussim.wordpress.com/2008/12/15/origem-judaica-cearenses-permanbucanos-alagoanos-mineiros-teshuvah/|title=Nordestinos anusim de ascendência judaica podem tornar-se cidadãos israelenses|publisher=Matéria jornalística em Diário do Nordeste, Fortaleza CE|date=2005-10-13 |accessdate=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside these military attempts, a very small number of non-Portuguese people appear to have managed to enter Brazil from European countries other than Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Flávia de Ávila |title=Entrada de Trabalhadores Estrangeiros no Brasil: Evolução Legislativa e Políticas Subjacentes nos Séculos XIX e XX''.

However, in the Southern Brazilian areas disputed between Portugal and Spain, Spanish colonists largely contributed for the ethnic formation of the local population, denominated [[Gaúcho]]s. A genetic research conducted by [[FAPESP]] (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo) on Gaúchos from Bagé and Alegrete, in Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil, revealed that they are mostly descended from Portuguese and Spanish ancestors, with 52% of them having Amerindian MtDNA (similar to that found in people who live in the area of the [[Amazon rainforest]], and significantly higher than the national average{{snd}} 33%{{snd}} among Brazilian whites) and 11% African MtDNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/?art=3194&amp;bd=1&amp;pg=1&amp;lg= |title=O DNA dos Pampas |website=Revistapesquisa.fapesp.br |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study also concluded that for the formation of the Gaúcho there was a predominance of Iberians, particularly Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/10934|title=História genética dos gaúchos : dinâmica populacional do sul do Brasil|website=Lume.ufrgs.br|accessdate=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; To evaluate the extension of Gaucho genetic diversity of the Gauchos, and retrieve part of their history, a study with 547 individuals, of which 278 were Native Americans (Guarani and Kaingang) and 269 admixed from the state of Rio Grande do Sul, was carried out. The genetic finding matches with the explanation of sociologist [[Darcy Ribeiro]] about the ethnic formation of the Brazilian Gaúchos: they are mostly the result of the miscegenation of Spanish and Portuguese males with Amerindian females.&lt;ref name=Ribeiro&gt;RIBEIRO, Darcy.

===Immigration===
{{Main article|Immigration to Brazil|European immigration to Brazil}}

It was only in 1818 that the Portuguese rulers abandoned the principle of restricting settling in Brazil to Portuguese nationals. In that year over two thousand Swiss migrants from the [[Canton of Fribourg]] arrived to settle in an inhospitable area near Rio de Janeiro that would later be renamed [[Nova Friburgo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multirio.rj.gov.br/historia/modulo02/colonia_suica.html|title=A Colônia Suíça de Nova Friburgo|website=Multirio.rj.gov.br|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of German immigrants had great importance for the demographics of [[Southern Brazil]]. They founded rural communities that later became prosperous cities, as was the case of [[São Leopoldo]], [[Joinville]] and [[Blumenau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mluther.org.br/Imigracao/imigracao_ii.htm |title=imigracao II |website=Mluther.org.br |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the slave trade (1850) and the abolition of slavery (1888) prompted the Brazilian State to promote European immigration to Brazil. The production of coffee, the main product of Brazil at the time, began to suffer a shortage of workers. From 1876, Italian immigrants began to enter Brazil in huge numbers. From 1884 to 1933, 1.4&amp;nbsp;million Italians immigrated to Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/tabelas/imigracao_nacionalidade_84a33.htm|title=Imigração no Brasil|date=16 December 2007|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=19 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216161032/http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/tabelas/imigracao_nacionalidade_84a33.htm|archivedate=16 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70% of whom settled in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].

The period of the great immigration, between 1876 and 1930, brought to the country more than 5&amp;nbsp;million Europeans. Most were Italians and Portuguese, followed by Spaniards, Germans, Poles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiobras.gov.br/especiais/saopaulo450/sp450_mat9_2004.htm|title=Especiais - Agência Brasil|date=13 January 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=19 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113232910/http://www.radiobras.gov.br/especiais/saopaulo450/sp450_mat9_2004.htm|archivedate=13 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ukrainians of Brazil|Ukrainians]]. It is notable that most of these immigrants settled in [[Southern Brazil|Southern]] and [[Southeastern Brazil]].

Brazilian demographers have long discussed the demographic impact of the wave of emigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to Judicael Clevelário,&lt;ref name="unicamp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol14_n1e2_1997/vol14_n1e2_1997_3artigo_51_71.pdf|date=21 July 2003|title=A participação da imigração na formação da população brasileira|author=Judicael Clevelario Júnior|accessdate=2014-07-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622124519/http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol14_n1e2_1997/vol14_n1e2_1997_3artigo_51_71.pdf|archivedate=22 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; most studies about the impact of immigration have followed Giorgio Mortara's conclusions in the 40's and 50's. Mortara&lt;ref&gt;Mortara, Giorgio. O aumento da população do Brasil entre 1872 e 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that only about 19% of the demographic growth of Brazil, from 1840 and 1940 was due to immigration, and that the population of immigrant origin was of 16% of the total population of Brazil.&lt;ref name="unicamp"/&gt;

However, according to Clevelário, Mortara failed to properly take into account the full endogenous growth of the population of immigrant origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol14_n1e2_1997/vol14_n1e2_1997_3artigo_51_71.pdf |title=p.52 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622124519/http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol14_n1e2_1997/vol14_n1e2_1997_3artigo_51_71.pdf |archivedate=22 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the predominantly rural settlement of the immigrants (rural regions tend to have higher natality rates than cities). Clevelário, then, besides extending the calculations up to 1980, remade them, reaching somewhat different conclusions.

One of the problems of calculating the impact of immigration in Brazilian demography is that the return rates of immigrants are unknown. Clevelário, thence, supposed four different hypotheses concerning the return rates. The first, that he deems unrealistically high, is that 50% of the immigrants to Brazil returned to their countries of origin. The second is based on the work of Arthur Neiva, who supposes the return rate for Brazil was higher than that of USA (30%) but lower than that of Argentina (47%). The third hypothesis is taken from Mortara, who postulates a rate of 20% for the 19th century, 35% for the first two decades of the 20th century, and 25% for 1920 onwards. Although Mortara himself considered this hypothesis underestimated, Clevelário thinks it is the closest to reality. The last hypothesis, also admittedly unrealistic, is that of a 0% rate of return, which is known to be false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol14_n1e2_1997/vol14_n1e2_1997_3artigo_51_71.pdf |title=p.57 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622124519/http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol14_n1e2_1997/vol14_n1e2_1997_3artigo_51_71.pdf |archivedate=22 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clevelário's conclusions are as follows: considering hypothesis 1 (unrealistically high), the Population of Immigrant Origin in 1980 would be 14,730,710 people, or 12.38% of the total population. Considering hypothesis 2 (based on Neiva), it would be 17,609,052 people, or 14.60% of the total population. Considering hypothesis 3 (based on Mortara, and considered most realistic), it would be 22,088,829 people, or 18.56% of the total population. Considering hypothesis 4 (no return at all), the Population of Immigrant origin would be 29,348,423 people, or 24.66% of the total population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol14_n1e2_1997/vol14_n1e2_1997_3artigo_51_71.pdf |title=Table 5, p.59; Table 6, p.60. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622124519/http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol14_n1e2_1997/vol14_n1e2_1997_3artigo_51_71.pdf |archivedate=22 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clevelário believes the most probable number to be close to 18%, higher than Mortara's previous estimate of 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol14_n1e2_1997/vol14_n1e2_1997_3artigo_51_71.pdf |title=Abstract, p. 71. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622124519/http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol14_n1e2_1997/vol14_n1e2_1997_3artigo_51_71.pdf |archivedate=22 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Census of 1872, Black and "Brown" people made up the majority (58%) of Brazil's population. The white population grew faster than the non-White population due to the subsidized immigration of Europeans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By 1890, the African-descended population was reduced to 47% and the Amerindian to 9%.&lt;ref name="IBGE 2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/condicaodevida/indicadoresminimos/sinteseindicsociais2008/indic_sociais2008.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=10 July 2012|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=19 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710024258/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/condicaodevida/indicadoresminimos/sinteseindicsociais2008/indic_sociais2008.pdf|archivedate=10 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disproportionally fast growth of the white population, due to mass immigration, lasted until 1940, when its proportion in the Brazilian population peaked at 63.5%.&lt;ref name="IBGE 2008"/&gt;

According to a genetic study, the European immigration to Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries left a "strong imprint" in the genetics of the Brazilian population, leading to the "whitening" of Brazil. The massive European immigration promoted by the Brazilian government after 1872 that brought nearly 6&amp;nbsp;million Europeans in order to "whiten" the country's population had an important effect, and it manifests in a predominance (over 70%) of European ancestry in white Brazilian, as well as a large European admixture (37.1%) in Black Brazilians. The scholars divided the formation of the Brazilian population into three periods: the first when the country was inhabited only by Amerindians, who contributed for the early formation of the population; the second was during the large influx of slaves from Africa until 1850 and the third was during the large influx of European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-879X2009005000026&amp;script=sci_arttext |title=DNA tests probe the genomic ancestry of Brazilians |website=Scielo.br |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, until the mid-19th-century, white people never exceeded 30% of the population in Brazil, while [[Caboclos]], Amerindians, Blacks and Mulattoes always predominated.&lt;ref name=Freyre&gt;ILARI, Rodolgo, BASSO, Renato. O Português da Gente. Editora Contexto (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study has pointed out that the European ancestry is dominant throughout Brazil at 80%, which means that even in the states not hit by the most recent waves of immigration, European ancestry dominates in the population as a whole. "A new portrayal of each ethnicity contribution to the DNA of Brazilians, obtained with samples from the five regions of the country, has indicated that, on average, European ancestors are responsible for nearly 80% of the genetic heritage of the population. The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%. The results, published by the scientific magazine 'American Journal of Human Biology' by a team of the Catholic University of Brasília, show that, in Brazil, physical indicators such as skin colour, colour of the eyes and colour of the hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person, which has been shown in previous studies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ciencia/ult306u633465.shtml |title=Folha Online - Ciência - DNA de brasileiro é 80% europeu, indica estudo - 05/10/2009 |website=Folha.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
White Brazilians are descended either from colonial settlers, who came from Portugal from 1500 to 1822, or from the diverse groups of immigrants who arrived after independence. The latter had a greater impact in the demography of the [[Southern Brazil|Southern]] states and of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].

Different from the colonists who settled in North America, who brought their entire families, the [[Portuguese colonization]] was almost exclusively composed of men, with a limited presence of women. This lack of women worried the Jesuits, who asked the Portuguese King to send any kind of Portuguese women to Brazil, even the socially undesirable (e.g. prostitutes or women with mental maladies such as Down Syndrome) if necessary.&lt;ref name="ensinarhistoria"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; The Crown responded by sending several groups of Iberian orphan maidens to marry both cohorts of marriageable men, the nobles and the peasants. Some of which were even primarily studying to be nuns.&lt;ref name="ensinarhistoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companhiadasletras.com.br/detalhe.php?codigo=10637|title=Desmundo by Ana Miranda|website=Companhiadasletras.com.br|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown also shipped over many [[Órfãs d'El-Rei]] of what was considered "good birth" to [[colonial Brazil]] to marry Portuguese settlers of high rank. ''Órfãs d'El-Rei'' (modern Portuguese ''órfãs do rei'') literally translates to "Orphans of the King", and they were Portuguese girl orphans in nubile age.{{sfnp|Telfer|1932|p=184}} There were noble and non-noble maidens and they were daughters of military compatriots who died in battle for the king or noblemen who died overseas and whose upbringing was paid by the Crown.{{sfnp|Telfer|1932|p=184}} Bahia's port in the East received one of the first groups of orphans in 1551.{{sfnp|Bethell|1984|p=47}} But most of the first Portuguese settlers also procreated with [[indigenous peoples in Brazil|native Amerindians]] or [[Afro-Brazilian|African slave]] women. Over time, the number of Portuguese women immigrating to Brazil grew, but the gender imbalance was never significantly reduced. This male predominance prevailed throughout the [[Colonial Brazil|colonial]] period. Historically, the male Portuguese settler preferred to marry a Portuguese born female. But, since their number in Brazil was very small, the second option was to marry a white Brazilian, born to Portuguese parents. The third option was a white Brazilian female of distant Portuguese origin. The scarce presence of white women, either Portuguese or Brazilian, caused the high degree of [[miscegenation]] in colonial Brazil.

Even though the immigration of non-Portuguese was allowed from 1818 on, the Portuguese predominance continued way up to the 1870 years. A consistent flux of German immigrants started to arrive to Southern Brazil, briefly interrupted by the [[Ragamuffin War]], but the amount of Portuguese immigrants was much bigger during this period.

The census of 1872, counted 3,787,289 whites in Brazil. Despite the largest arrivals of European immigrants, particularly between 1880 and 1930, the nowadays white Brazilian population has a considerable proportion of citizens that are still mainly descended from whites of colonial extraction (Lusitanians but also Spaniards, Dutch, French, [[Anusim]] and others), especially those groups in the Northeast, the borders of Rio Grande do Sul with Argentina and Uruguay, and the Center-West, with the exception of Mato Grosso do Sul, partially populated by Italian, German and Polish farmers from São Paulo and the South, just like the case of [[Brasiguaios]], Brazilian landowners in Paraguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colegiosaofrancisco.com.br/alfa/darcy-ribeiro/o-povo-brasileiro-3.php |title=O povo brasileiro 3 |website=Colegiosaofrancisco.com.br |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120728115502/http://www.colegiosaofrancisco.com.br/alfa/darcy-ribeiro/o-povo-brasileiro-3.php |archivedate=28 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/countries/paraguay-facts/|title=Paraguay|website=travel.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/12/world/12PARA.html?ex=1152849600&amp;en=6a4520630e3b9860&amp;ei=5070&amp;pagewanted=1 San Alberto Journal: Awful Lot of Brazilians in Paraguay, Locals Say]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 12 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

South American [[oligarchies]], which remained predominantly of European origin, believed{{snd}} in syntony with the racialist theories then widespread in Europe{{snd}} that the large numbers of blacks and mixed Amerindians that made up the majority of the population were a handicap to the development of their countries. As a result, countries such as [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]] and Brazil started to encourage the arrival of European immigrants, in order to make the white population grow and to dilute the African and Amerindian blood in their population. Argentina even has an article in its Constitution prohibiting any attempt to prevent the entry of European immigrants in the country.&lt;ref&gt;''Senado de la Nación Argentina'', [http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/interes/constitucion/capitulo1.php Constitución de la Nación Argentina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412110428/http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/interes/constitucion/capitulo1.php |date=12 April 2013 }} Art. 25 {{quote|El Gobierno federal fomentará la inmigración europea; y no podrá restringir, limitar ni gravar con impuesto alguno la entrada en el territorio argentino de los extranjeros que traigan por objeto labrar la tierra, mejorar las industrias, e introducir y enseñar las ciencias y las artes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Brazil, the immigrants started arriving in huge numbers during the 1880s. From 1886 to 1900, almost 1.4&amp;nbsp;million Europeans arrived, of whom over 900,000 were Italians. During this period of 14 years, Brazil received more Europeans than during the over 300 years of colonization.

According to [[Darcy Ribeiro]] before 1850 no more than 500,000 Europeans settled in Brazil&lt;ref&gt;Darcy Ribeiro. O Povo Brasileiro, edition 07, 1997 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] estimated that the number was close to 700,000 Portuguese during the 18th century.&lt;ref name="ibge"/&gt; The mass European immigration to Brazil only started in the second half of the 19th century, from 1850 to 1970 over 6&amp;nbsp;million Europeans arrived, because of three main reasons:

*to "whiten" Brazil, since the Amerindian and African elements predominated in the population, a fact that was considered a problem by the local elite, that considered these races inferior. Bringing European immigrants was seen as a way to "improve" the racial composition of the local population;
*to populate inhospitable areas of Brazil, mostly the Southern provinces;
*to replace African manpower, since the [[Atlantic slave trade]] was effectively suppressed in 1850 and coffee plantations were spreading in the region of São Paulo.

These immigrants had a larger and more visible impact in the state of São Paulo, along with the three southern states of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]. In the southern states there were entire regions (such as the Serra Gaúcha and Vale do Jacuí) populated by German and Italian-speaking inhabitants. The immigrants remained closed in ethnic communities for decades. The Portuguese language only started to be used by these communities many decades after their arrival, as a result of their contact with Brazilians and with immigrants from other countries, but also because of the forced assimilation during the [[Getúlio Vargas]]'s government, mostly inside the German community. In contrast to the early Portuguese colonists, these immigrants arrived with their entire families in Brazil, with large numbers of women and children. As a result, the areas where they were concentrated, most remarkably the central parts of Southern Brazil, became predominantly white.

In São Paulo, [[paulistas]] of Italian descent outnumbered those of earlier extraction. In this region, Italians, Portuguese, Spaniards and Arabs were easily integrated, since they had a close contact with the large local Brazilian population. At first working on coffee farms, later they moved to cities and participated in the process of industrialization of Brazil.

==Regions of settlement==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
The first economic activity the Portuguese crown devised in Brazil—the collection of [[Brazilwood]]—was not conducive to an actual occupation of the territory.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  The establishment of a few "feitorias" that conducted the trade was not enough to populate Brazil.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  The growing competition from other colonial powers—especially France—led the Portuguese into finding other economic activities that could serve as a base for a permanent and solid integration of Brazil into Portuguese domains. The first such activity to attain success was the cultivation of sugarcane—and the associated extraction of sugar, since sugarcane could not be transported overseas without deteriorating.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  This activity was also complementary with the slave trade that the Portuguese were starting, at that moment, from their African colonies of Angola and Mozambique. Sugarcane proved very well adapted to the climate of the Northeastern litoral, so the first stable and prosperous Portuguese settlements—and consequently, the first stable and prosperous centers of white population in Brazil—where located in that region.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The economy of sugarcane culture being centered in exporting to Portugal, other economic activities appeared to fulfill the necessities of the region. Remarkably, husbandry spread into the arid hinterland, where it remained the most important economic activity for centuries.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The region around São Vicente, in modern São Paulo state, remained less developed, with a weaker integration to the colonial economy. This probably prompted the inhabitants to explore the hinterland. In theory looking for gold and gems, in practice they engaged in expeditions with the objective of capturing and enslaving Amerindians. These slaves were used in the incipient agriculture around [[São Paulo]], which, to the end of the 16th century became specialised in wheat, as a commercial crop that could be sold in other parts of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;John Manuel Monteiro, Negros da Terra&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--- It is necessary to complete this with chapter, page, etc. ---&gt;

Around 1700, the paulistas found gold in the region that is now Minas Gerais.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Together with the growing competition of Caribbean sugar, this made the center of the Brazilian economy move to the Southwest. The administrative center of the colony was moved from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. The discovery of mineral wealth caused the influx of Portuguese settlers to redirect from the Northeast to the mining region, and the number of Portuguese leaving for Brazil to increase greatly; also there was a change in the social profile of those coming to Brazil. Agriculture needed substantial investments, but gold mining required much more courage and less initial capital, and the proportion of poor Portuguese among the newcomers increased considerably.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The Southern region was also first settled by the paulistas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Arriving there in search of the Amerindians in the Jesuit reductions, they subsequently raided the region in search of the cattle gone astray with the destruction of the [[Missões]], first for the leather, then organising a commercial circuit that moved cattle on feet to the mining region (''ciclo do gado a pé''). As a result, the Portuguese domain extended firmly to the south, threatening the control of the Northern bank of the Plata by the Spanish.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

However, the impact of the European immigration was larger in Southern Brazil, because even though it got a lesser migration, since it had a very small population, the immigration's impact was greater to its demography when compared to other Brazilian regions. The main concentrations in Rio Grande do Sul were Venetian Italians where their dialect is still spoken and Germans from the [[Hunsrück]] region of Germany ([[Rhineland-Palatinate]]) who also kept their [[Hunsrückisch dialect]] known as ''Riograndensisch'', followed by Poles. Their arriving numbers supplanted the previous Iberian population, founding cities like [[Novo Hamburgo]] and [[Garibaldi, Rio Grande do Sul|Garibaldi]].&lt;ref name="brasil500anos.ibge.gov.br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brasil500anos.ibge.gov.br/territorio-brasileiro-e-povoamento/alemaes/regioes-de-origem-e-de-destino-dos-imigrantes|title=Regiões de origem e de destino dos imigrantes teutônicos |publisher=ibge|accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; German immigrants first arrived in 1824 settling in the [[Sinos River Valley]], where one of the first colonies to take an urbanized figure was Hamburger Berg, future Novo Hamburgo, dismembered from or spun out of [[São Leopoldo]], dubbed the cradle of German culture in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Altenhofen, Cléo Vilson: Hunsrückisch in Rio Grande do Sul, Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart 1996, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Its capital, Porto Alegre, has the third largest Jewish population in the nation.&lt;ref name="firgs.org.br"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firgs.org.br/paginas/a-federacao-israelita-do-rio-grande-do-sul-.aspx |title=Federação Israelita do Rio Grande do Sul |website=Firgs.org.br |year=2009 |accessdate=2013-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528001315/http://www.firgs.org.br/paginas/a-federacao-israelita-do-rio-grande-do-sul-.aspx |archivedate=28 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The vast majority of Slavs is concentrated in Paraná, mainly Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Russians, followed by German and Italian dwellers in the countryside who also arrived to populate the sparsely inhabited South. Some localities like [[Mallet, Paraná|Mallet]], a 19th-century settlement founded by Poles from Austrian [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)]] and Ukrainians that grew up to be a town, still maintain both their languages and traditions in a Polish-Ukrainian [[:wikt:continuum|continuum]]. After 1909 Dutch settlers became accountable for the dairy farming development in the prairies region of the state, known as ''Campos Gerais do Paraná'', where today are the towns of [[Castro, Paraná|Castro]] and [[Carambeí]] dubbed Little Holland. The Castro region also received many Lithuanians. The capital, Curitiba, is home to a large figure of [[Volga Germans]] that outnumbered the initial and primary [[Bandeirante]] descent population during the [[Empire of Brazil|Imperial period]], Faroese people and other Scandinavians, as well as to Slavs, Italians, French, Swiss, Spaniards and one of the country's Jewish communities.&lt;ref name="Abril"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brasil500anos.ibge.gov.br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Um atalho para a Europa"&gt;{{cite web |title=Um atalho para a Europa |work=Epoca |publisher=Editora Globo S.A |date= 24 June 2002 |url=http://epoca.globo.com/edic/214/soci1a.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821072841/http://epoca.globo.com/edic/214/soci1a.htm |archivedate=21 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paraná State Government page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidadao.pr.gov.br/modules/conteudo/conteudo.php?conteudo=77 |title=Paraná State Government page |website=Cidadao.pr.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vanhoni.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanhoni.com.br/inauguracao-das-obras-de-restauro-da-igreja-sao-miguel-arcanjo-mallet-pr/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630174757/http://www.vanhoni.com.br/inauguracao-das-obras-de-restauro-da-igreja-sao-miguel-arcanjo-mallet-pr/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 June 2016|title=Restauração da igreja ortodoxa de Mallet - Marco da valorização da presença eslava no Sul do Brasil|website=Vanhoni.com|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rcub.com.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcub.com.br/rcub/inaugurado-o-restauro-da-igreja-de-sao-miguel-arcanjo-na-serra-do-tigre-em-mallet/|title=Inaugurado o restauro da igreja ortodoxa de São Miguel Arcanjo em Mallet - Marco da imigração ucraniana no Brasil|publisher=Representação Central Ucraniano-Brasileira|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Monumento ao Imigrante2.jpg|thumb|Monument to the immigrant in [[Caxias do Sul]].

Neighboring towns such as [[Nova Trento]] founded in 1875, similarly received subjects from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] due the fact that Italian-speaking Tyroleans known as ''trentinos'' and Germans from the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], historic [[Swabia]] and [[Baden]] faced an immense crisis in the agricultural sector caused by the conflicts of the [[Italian Unification|unification of Italy]] and [[German Unification|Germany respectively]], that weakened local trade. [[Istrian Italians]] under the [[Austrian Empire]] rule also fled [[Istria]] to settle in Brazil, and a few towns like [[Nova Veneza, Santa Catarina|Nova Veneza]], founded in 1891 still have an over 90% Venetian population of which many still speak the Talian dialect.

[[File:Imigrantes portugueses.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] kids waiting for a ship to leave for Brazil (early 20th century)]]

After independence in 1822, about 1.79&amp;nbsp;million Portuguese immigrants arrived in Brazil, most of them in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="População Brasileira p. 73"&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rsp/v8s0/03.pdf] Maria Stella Ferreira Levy. O Papel da Migração Internacional na Evolução da
População Brasileira. Table 1, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these immigrants settled in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref name="Abril"/&gt;

Portuguese immigration into Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries was marked by its concentration in the states of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] and Espírito Santo. The immigrants opted mostly for [[urban center]]s. Portuguese women appeared with some regularity among immigrants, with percentage variation in different decades and regions of the country. However, even among the influx of Portuguese immigrants at the turn of the 20th century, there were 319 men to each 100 women among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol6_n2_1989/vol6_n2_1989_2artigo_17_37.pdf |title=A Integração social e económica dos emigrantes portugueses no Brasil |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230163157/http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol6_n2_1989/vol6_n2_1989_2artigo_17_37.pdf |archivedate=30 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese were different from other immigrants in Brazil, like the Germans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ich.unito.com.br/materia/resource/download/41917|title=Retrato Molecular- Genética|website=Ich.unito.com.br|accessdate=2017-08-19}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Italians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=ncc7WLAXlmQC |page=99 }} |title=Do outro lado do Atlântico: um século de imigração italiana no Brasil |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; who brought many women along with them (even though the proportion of men was higher in any immigrant community). Despite the smaller female proportion, Portuguese men married mainly Portuguese women. Female immigrants rarely married Brazilian men. In this context, the Portuguese had a rate of [[endogamy]] which was higher than any other European immigrant community, and behind only the Japanese among all immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://analisesocial.ics.ul.pt/documentos/1223290545Z8cUY2rh7Lu99TE5.pdf |title=A integração social e económica dos imigrantes portugueses no Brasil nos finais do século xix e no século xx |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional figure of 1.2 million Portuguese arrived between 1951 and 1975 to settle mostly in the Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/portugal/interior/estudo-descobre-3119-milhoes-de-portugueses-pelo-mundo--1192698.html?id=1192698 |title=Estudo descobre 31 milhões de portugueses pelo mundo|website=Dn.pt|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italians====
{{Main article|Italian Brazilian}}
[[File:Imigrantes da Italia.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Italians going to Brazil by ship (1910)]]

About 1.64&amp;nbsp;million [[Italians]] arrived in Brazil, starting in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rsp/v8s0/03.pdf |title=Maria Stella Ferreira Levy. O Papel da Migração Internacional na Evolução da População Brasileira.

In the late 19th century, the Brazilian State offered land to [[Immigration to Brazil|immigrants]], in conditions that made it possible to buy them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pesquisa.uncnet.br/pdf/historia/IMIGRACAO_MEMORIA.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320031859/http://www.pesquisa.uncnet.br/pdf/historia/IMIGRACAO_MEMORIA.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 March 2009|title=Wayback Machine|date=20 March 2009|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, their destination were mostly the [[coffee]] plantations in the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]], especially the states of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and [[Minas Gerais]], where they initially worked for the local landowners, either for a wage or under a contract that allowed them to use a portion of land for subsistency, in exchange for labour in the plantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familiasceccon.com.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=7 |title=TICON - TICOM - Breve História da Imigração Italiana |publisher=Familias CECCON |date=2006-06-23 |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italians made up the main group of immigrants to Brazil in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Entrada de estrangeiros no Brasil"/&gt;

The vast majority of the Italian settlers came from [[Veneto]] and, according to [[Ethnologue]], today around 4 million people still speak the [[Venetian dialect]] called [[Talian dialect|Talian]] or Veneto in [[Southern Brazil]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;{{e16|vec|Venetian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veneto was followed mainly by [[Campania]], [[Lombardy]], [[Calabria]], [[Abruzzi e Molise]], [[Tuscany]] and [[Emilia Romagna]].&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

In [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo capital]], which came to be labeled an "Italian city" in the early twentieth century, Italians engaged mainly in the incipient industry and urban services activities. They came to represent 90% of the 60,000 workers employed in São Paulo factories in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brasil500anos.ibge.gov.br/territorio-brasileiro-e-povoamento/italianos/os-imigrantes-nas-cidades.html|title=São Paulo capital, uma cidade italiana e os misteres profissionais dos imigrantes italianos |publisher=ibge|accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spaniards====
{{Main article|Spanish immigration to Brazil|Brazilians of Spanish descent}}
About 720,000 [[Spaniards]] came to Brazil, starting in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="População Brasileira p. 73"/&gt; Most of them were attracted to work in the coffee plantations in the State of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].&lt;ref name="Abril"/&gt;

In all Brazilian states, the immigrants from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] predominated, and those were predominantly [[male]]s, who emigrated alone, settled in urban centers and paid for their passage by ship.&lt;ref name=boris&gt;FAUSTO, Boris. Fazer a América: a imigração em massa para a América Latina.&lt;/ref&gt; The only exception was the state of São Paulo, destination for the vast majority of the Spaniards, between 66% and 75% of the total. In São Paulo, 55% were from Andaluzia, and only 23% from Galicia.&lt;ref name=boris/&gt; Those had their passage by ship paid by the Brazilian government, emigrated in families and were taken to the coffee farms for the needed manpower. 
Galician smallholders and artisans settled mainly in urban areas of Brazil and eventually became factory workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceedings.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=MSC0000000012002000200006&amp;script=sci_arttext#tx02|title=Congresso Brasileiro de Hispanistas - Os periodicos dos imigrantes espanhois|website=Proceedings.scielo.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One factor that contributed to the more rapid process of assimilation and acculturation of the community of Spanish origin in Brazil was, in addition to linguistic and cultural proximity (accentuated by the high presence of [[Galicians]] whose [[Galician language]] is closer to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] due the fact that they share or belong to the same linguistic system, differently from [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]), the ease with which both Spanish men and women married Brazilians, mostly Lusitanian Brazilians: 64.7% of Spanish men married Brazilian women and 47.2% of Spanish women married Brazilian men.&lt;ref name=boris/&gt;

====Germans and Austrians====

The author [[Stefan Zweig]] who wrote about Brazil, and the Habsburg-Lorraine [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria]], [[list of Brazilian consorts|Empress consort of Brazil]], are among the most prominent Austrians to settle in Brazil.

About 260,000 [[Germans]] settled in Brazil.&lt;ref name=International-Migration-to-Brazil&gt;''Ferreira Levy, Maria Stella''.

The vast majority settled in states of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]].

[[Poles]] came in significant numbers to Brazil after 1870. Most of them settled in the State of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], working as small farmers.&lt;ref name="Um atalho para a Europa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paraná State Government page"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vanhoni.com"/&gt; From 1872 to 1919, 110,243 "Russian" citizens entered Brazil. In fact, the vast majority of them were Poles ("Russian" Catholics), since, up to 1917, a part of Poland was under Russian rule due to the [[Partitions of Poland]] and ethnic Poles immigrated with Russian [[passport]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/anais/pdf/2000/Todos/Uma+Hist%C3%B3ria+Oculta+a+Imigra%C3%A7ao+dos+Pa%C3%ADs|title=Wayback Machine|date=25 February 2009|accessdate=19 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish can still be heard in small towns such as [[Mallet, Paraná]], where the vast majority of the population descends from Western and Northern [[Slavs|Slavic]] settlers who arrived in Brazil in the 1890s (mostly Poles who came from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] which was under [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian rule]] then).&lt;ref name="periodicos.ufes.br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seer.ufu.br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revistas.usp.br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vanhoni.com"/&gt;

The first Dutch immigrants to South America after its independence waves from their [[metropole]]s went to the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo between 1858 and 1862, where they founded the settlement of Holanda, a colony of 500 mainly Reformed folk from West Zeeuws-Vlaanderen in the Dutch province of Zeeland.&lt;ref name="swierenga.com"/&gt;
Dutch and other [[Low Franconian languages]] are still spoken in São Paulo (state), especially [[Holambra]] (named after Holland-America-Brazil), famous for its tulips and the annual Expoflora event, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and around [[Ponta Grossa]], [[Castrolanda]] and [[Carambeí]] known as little Holland, in the plains of Paraná, headquarters of several food companies and a dairy farming region.&lt;ref name="revistas.usp.br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paraná State Government page"/&gt;

[[File:Alberto Santos-Dumont portrait.jpg|thumb|right|210px| [[Alberto Santos-Dumont|Alberto Dumont]] ]]

Between 1850 and 1965 around 100,000 French people immigrated to Brazil. The country received the second largest number of French immigrants to South America after Argentina (239,000).

====Scandinavian countries====
{{Main article|Scandinavian Brazilian}}

Brazil is home to the largest Scandinavian population (Germanic Nordic countries) in Latin America, with a majority of [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://7a12.ibge.gov.br/voce-sabia/calendario-7a12/evento/88-aniversario-de-joinville-sc.html|title=Noruegueses|publisher=IBGE|accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 2000 Brazilian census reports that Brazil, in the 2000 census, has 465,44 inhabitants of (partial) Norwegian ancestry.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relations between Brazil and Sweden are rooted in the family ties of the Brazilian and the Swedish Royal Families and in the Swedish emigration to Brazil in the end of the 19th century. The wife of King [[Oscar I of Sweden|Oscar I]] of [[United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway|Sweden and Norway]], Queen [[Joséphine of Leuchtenberg]], was sister to [[Amélie of Leuchtenberg]], wife of Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Diplomatic relations between Brazil and Sweden were established in 1826. During the mid to late 19th century many Scandinavians arrived in Brazil, particularly to the southern states as well as Rio de Janeiro, which features a Scandinavian Association,&lt;ref name="scandinavian-association"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scandinavian-association.net/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306045707/http://www.scandinavian-association.net/index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 March 2007|title=Scandinavian Association Rio de Janeiro - Start|accessdate=2014-07-12|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and São Paulo, where the Scandinavian church is based.

Fernando Lázaro de Barros Basto in ''Síntese da história da imigração no Brasil''(1970) gives a total number of 319,215 immigrants from "Russia" (i.e. the Russian Empire pre-1917 and the Soviet Union post-1917) for the period of 1871 to 1968.

====Balts (Lithuanians and Latvians)====

[[File:Lasar Segall 1905 - Variante 1.jpg|thumb|left|140px| Impressionist, expressionist and modernist painter, engraver and sculptor [[Lasar Segall]] ]]

Brazil is home to the largest [[Balts|Baltic diaspora]] outside their original land, especially [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] descendants. Their migration peaked in 1920s and 1930s, when 35% of all emigrants from interwar Lithuania chosen Brazil as their destination, around 50 000 moved in.&lt;ref name="ilas.columbia.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Um atalho para a Europa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lithuanian descendants in Brazil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.truelithuania.com/brazil-474/|title=Lithuanian descendants in Brazil|website=Global.truelithuania.com|date= |accessdate=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides Lithuanians, the Baltic diaspora also comprises one of the largest [[Latvians|Latvian]] populations.&lt;ref name="Um atalho para a Europa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brazilianembassy.se/english/latviaV2eng.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070104041645/http://www.brazilianembassy.se/english/latviaV2eng.asp |archivedate=4 January 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lituanus.org/1987/87_3_02.htm|title=A Millenarian Migration: Varpa|website=Lituanus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Lithuanians to set foot on Brazil in the 19th century had as their destination the newly established colony of [[Ijuí]], situated on the red and fertile soil of the northwestern part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, while most Lithuanians and Latvians would settle in São Paulo posteriorly. Besides São Paulo, other states that received Baltic people during the 20th century were Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina and Espírito Santo. Latvian is still spoken in Santa Catarina and Paraná.

Today, the state of São Paulo is home to the majority of the Lithuanian Brazilians, and its capital hosts the only true Lithuanian neighborhood in South America - Vila Zelina. Its construction was carried out ~1927 when Lithuanian immigration was peaking. The district is centered around Republic of Lithuania Plaza (''Praça República Lituânia''), where 7 streets meet up (one of them named after a Lithuanian priest Pijus Ragažinskas (Pio Ragazinskas, 1907-1988) who started the only Lithuanian-Brazilian newspaper ''"Mūsų Lietuva"''). Liberty statue (1977) that crowns the Plaza center is modelled after the one in Kaunas, Lithuania (that original symbol of interwar Lithuanian freedom had been pulled down by Soviets in 1950, making its reconstruction in communism-free São Paulo even more symbolic). It bears the inscription ''"Lietuviais esame gimę, lietuviais turime būt"'' ("Lithuanians we are born, Lithuanians we must be") - lyrics of a traditional patriotic song. They are joined by Columns of Gediminas, a symbol of the famous Gediminid dynasty (1315-1572) which brought the medieval Grand Duchy of Lithuania to its glory as the Europe's largest state. There's also a Lithuanian church facing the square.&lt;ref name="Lithuanian descendants in Brazil"/&gt;

Most Hungarian descendants live in São Paulo, where there are several Hungarian associations.

The [[Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373]] was signed between King Edward III of England and King Ferdinand and Queen Eleanor of Portugal. It established a treaty of "perpetual friendships, unions [and] alliances" between the two seafaring nations. It is the oldest active treaty in the world. The [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance]] is visible when on 23 June 1661 the marriage treaty between King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and [[Catherine of Braganza|Catherine of Bragança]] was duly signed. In return for [[Bombay]], [[Tangier]], free trade with Brazil and the East Indies acquired as the princess' dowry, England offered military assistance to help protect Portugal from Spain. Other noticeable occasions were during the Napoleonic Wars when the Portuguese royal family moved to Brazil with the help of the English fleet and the Portuguese assistance to England during the First War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/republic-portugal-facts|title=British-Portuguese Alliance|publisher=nzhistory|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British immigration to Brazil can be divided into four main periods: colonial, monarchical, Old Republic and the 1960s/1970s.

Texas A&amp;M University Press, 1985, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The bordering state of Paraná was the main destination in the South, followed by Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, where Americans arrived in 1867 settling in growing towns such as [[Brusque, Santa Catarina|Brusque]]. The city of Rio de Janeiro, the town of Rio Doce in Minas Gerais and the state of Espírito Santo were other destinations in the Southeast region. Later waves settled in Santarém, Pará—in the north of the Amazon River—as well as in the states of Bahia and Pernambuco, adding a significant number of immigrants to the region's population. Altogether, close to 25,000 American immigrants settled in Brazil during the 19th century.

[[File:Dan Stulbach.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Actor Dan Stulbach]]
 
Brazil is also home to one of the top 10 largest [[Jewish diaspora]]s on Earth, most of them of [[Jewish diaspora|Ashkenazi]] background but also [[Jewish population by urban areas|Sephardi Jews]] included. Brazil figures on the diasporas list together with Argentina, and São Paulo has one of the largest [[Jewish population by urban areas|Jewish populations by urban area]] on the planet. Ashkenazi Jews first arrived during Imperial times, when the liberal second emperor of Brazil welcomed a few thousands of families facing persecution in Europe during the 1870s and 1880s.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org1"/&gt; Two heavier influxes took place during the 20th century. The earliest right after the Great War and the second inrush between the 1930s and 1950s.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org1"/&gt;
[[Anusim]] or Portuguese and Dutch [[Marrano]] [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto Jews]] can be found in every one of the 5 geographical regions, but are most common in the Northeast, with Pernambuco having one of the largest [[Converso]] populations due to colonial history. Brazil has the oldest synagogue in the Americas founded during [[Dutch Brazil]] rule, [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], located in [[Recife]].&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt; Erected in 1636, its foundations have been recently rediscovered, and the 20th-century buildings on the site have been altered to resemble a 17th-century Dutch synagogue. There is now a [[museum]] on the site praising it as one of the [[Oldest synagogues in the world#South America and Caribbean|oldest synagogues in the world]]. After the Dutch defeat, part of those Jews moved to North America, settling in [[New Amsterdam]], Dutch colony that would become today's New York.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Dutch colonialism in Brazil"/&gt; They founded in New Amsterdam the oldest Jewish congregation in the USA, the [[Congregation Shearith Israel]].
 
The capital of São Paulo together with the satellite city of Campinas in the metropolitan area has the greatest number of Jews in the country,&lt;ref name="Brazil - Modern-Day Community"/&gt; followed by Rio de Janeiro capital&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; and Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul.&lt;ref name="firgs.org.br"/&gt; Other state capitals in the nation that figure among the largest Jewish communities are Curitiba in Paraná,&lt;ref name="ibge.gov.br 2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/ |title=Censo Demográfico Brasileiro de 2000|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/dozens-of-brazilian-olim-arrive-in-time-for-israels-purim-carnivals/2016/03/14/|title=Dozens of Brazilian Olim Arrive in Time for Israel’s Purim Carnivals - The Jewish Press - David Israel - 5 Adar II 5776 – March 14, 2016 - JewishPress.com|first=David|last=Israel|website=Jewishpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais,&lt;ref name="ibge.gov.br 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishpress.com"/&gt; Recife,&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt; the national capital Brasília in the Federal District,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/protabl.asp?c=2094&amp;z=cd&amp;o=7&amp;i=P|title=Tabela 2094: População residente por cor ou raça e religião|website=Sidra.ibge.gov.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belém,&lt;ref name="ibge.gov.br 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishpress.com"/&gt; Manaus&lt;ref name="jewishpress.com"/&gt; and Florianópolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tede.ufsc.br/teses/PPSI0224.pdf|format=PDF|title=UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SANTA CATARINA CENTRO DE FILOSOFIA E CIENCIAS HUMANAS : LIA VAINER SCHUCMAN|website=Tede.ufsc.br|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ufrgs.br/biblioestudosetnicos/santa-catarina/judeus/|title=Judeus em SC.

====Greeks====
{{Main article|Greek Brazilians}}
Greek immigration to Brazil can be divided into three periods. The first Greek families arrived during the monarchical period in the 19th century, followed by two larger influxes: the period right after the break of the Great War in 1914 and prolonged until the 1930s, and the final one right after WW2, with most Greeks settling in São Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miniweb.com.br/cidadania/personalidades/imigrantes11.html|title=Imigração Grega no Brasil|accessdate=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umabrasileiranagrecia.com/2013/11/a-imigracao-grega-no-brasil.html|title=A Imigração Grega no Brasil pode ser dividida em três fases|accessdate=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/127485|title=MEMÓRIAS, CONTRIBUIÇÕES E PERMANÊNCIAS DA COLÔNIA GREGA EM FLORIANÓPOLIS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brancos no Brasil.png|thumb|right|300px|Brazilian states according to the percentage of [[whites]] in 2009]]

The Brazilian states with the highest percentages of whites are the three located in the [[Southern Brazil|South of the country]]: [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]. These states, along with [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], received an important influx of European immigrants in the period of the Great Immigration (1876–1914).

===Cities and towns===
In a list of the 144 Brazilian towns with the highest percentages of whites, all the cities were located in two states: [[Rio Grande do Sul]] or [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. All these towns are settled predominantly by Brazilians of [[German Brazilian|German]] and [[Italo-Brazilian|Italian]] descent and are very small. It is important to note that in the late 19th century, many German and Italian immigrants created small communities across [[Southern Brazil]]. These communities were settled, in many cases, exclusivily by European immigrants and their descendants.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |doi=10.2307/3317070 |last=Azevedo |first=Thales de |title=Italian Colonization in Southern Brazil |journal=Anthropological Quarterly |volume=34 |issue=2 |year=1961 |pages=60–68 |jstor=3317070 |publisher=The George Washington University Institute for Ethnographic Research }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic research==
{{Summarize section|date=September 2017}}
The genes can reveal from what part of the world the oldest ancestors of the paternal and maternal line of a person came from. The [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) is present in all human beings and passed down through the maternal line, i.e. the mother of a mother of a mother etc. The [[Y chromosome]] is present only in males and passed down through the paternal line, i.e., the father of a father of a father etc. The [[mitochondrial DNA]] and [[Y chromosome]] suffer only minor mutations through centuries, thus can be used to establish the paternal line in males (because only males have the Y chromosome) and the maternal line in both males and females.

According to a genetic study about Brazilians (based upon about 200 samples), on the [[paternal]] side, 98% of the white Brazilian [[Y Chromosome]] comes from a European male ancestor, only 2% from an African ancestor and there is a complete absence of Amerindian contributions. On the [[maternal]] side, 39% have European [[Mitochondrial DNA]], 33% Amerindian and 28% African female ancestry. This, considering the facts that the slave trade was effectively suppressed in 1850, and that the Amerindian population had been reduced to small numbers even earlier, shows that at least 61% of white Brazilians had at least one ancestor living in Brazil before the beginning of the [[European immigration to Brazil|Great Immigration]]. This analysis, however, only shows a small fraction of a person's ancestry (the Y Chromosome comes from a single male ancestor and the mtDNA from a single female ancestor, while the contributions of the many other ancestors is not specified).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.educom.pt/p-pmndn/genes_cabral.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829035149/http://web.educom.pt/p-pmndn/genes_cabral.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 August 2007|title=Os Genes de Cabral|date=29 August 2007|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another genetic research (based upon about 200 samples again) over 75% of caucasians from [[Northern Brazil|North]], [[Northeastern Brazil|Northeast]] and [[Southeastern Brazil|Southeast Brazil]] would have over 10% [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n genes, and that this would also be the case with [[Southern Brazil]] for 49% of the caucasian population. According to this study, in all United States 11% of Caucasians have over 10% African genes. Thus, 86% of Brazilians would have at least 10% of genes that came from Africa. The researchers however were cautious about its conclusions: "Obviously these estimates were made by extrapolation of experimental results with relatively small samples and, therefore, their confidence limits are very ample". A new autosomal study from 2011, also led by Sérgio Pena, but with nearly 1000 samples this time, from all over the country, shows that in most Brazilian regions most Brazilians "whites" are less than 10% African in ancestry, and it also shows that the "pardos" are predominantly European in ancestry, the European ancestry being therefore the main component in the Brazilian population, in spite of a very high degree of African ancestry and significant Native American contribution.&lt;ref name="plosone.org"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0017063 |title=The Genomic Ancestry of Individuals from Different Geographical Regions of Brazil Is More Uniform Than Expected |journal=PLOS ONE |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2014-01-23 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0017063 |volume=6 |pages=e17063 |pmid=21359226 |pmc=3040205 | last1 = Pena | first1 = SD | last2 = Di Pietro | first2 = G | last3 = Fuchshuber-Moraes | first3 = M | display-authors = etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other autosomal studies (see some of them below) show a European predominance in the Brazilian population.

Another genetic research suggested that the white Brazilian population is not genetically homogenous, as its genomic ancestry varies in different regions. Samples of white males from [[Rio Grande do Sul]] have showed significant differences between whites of different localities of state. In a sample from the town of [[Veranópolis]], heavily settled by people of Italian descent, the results from the maternal and paternal sides showed almost complete European ancestry. On the other hand, a sample of whites from several other regions of Rio Grande do Sul showed significant fractions of Native American (36%) and African (16%) mtDNA haplogroups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hemocentro.fmrp.usp.br/projeto/artigos/artigo91.pdf |title=Heterogeneity of the Genome Ancestry of Individuals Classified as White in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313060458/http://www.hemocentro.fmrp.usp.br/projeto/artigos/artigo91.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study (based on blood polymorphisms, from 1981) carried out in one thousand individuals from [[Porto Alegre]] city, Southern Brazil, and 760 from [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] city, Northeastern Brazil, found whites of Porto Alegre had 8% of African alleles and in Natal the ancestry of the samples total was characterized as 58% white, 25% black, and 17% Amerindian. This study found that persons identified as white or Pardo in Natal have similar ancestries, a dominant European ancestry, while persons identified as white in Porto Alegre have an overwhelming majority of European ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Blood polymorphisms and racial admixture in two Brazilian populations |last=Helena |first=M. |first2=L.

According to an autosomal DNA genetic study from 2011, both "whites" and "pardos" from [[Fortaleza]] have a predominantly degree of European ancestry (&gt;70%), with minor but important African and Native American contributions. "Whites" and "pardos" from [[Belém]] and [[Ilhéus]] also were found to be pred. European in ancestry, with minor Native American and African contributions.&lt;ref name="plosone.org"/&gt;

According to another study, autosomal DNA study (see table), those who identified as whites in Rio de Janeiro turned out to have 86.4%{{snd}} and self identified pardos 68.1%{{snd}} European ancestry on average. Blacks were found out to have on average 41.8% European ancestry.&lt;ref name="laboratoriogene.com.br"/&gt;

According to another study (from 1965, and based on blood groups and electrophoretic markers) carried out on whites of Northeastern Brazilian origin living in São Paulo the ancestries would be 70% European, 18% African and 12% Amerindian admixture.&lt;ref name="PMC 140919" /&gt;

Another study (autosomal DNA study, from 2010) found out that European ancestry predominates in the Brazilian population as a whole ("whites", "pardos" and "blacks" altogether). European ancestry is dominant throughout Brazil at nearly 80%, except for the Southern part of Brazil, where the European heritage reaches 90%. "A new portrayal of each ethnicity contribution to the DNA of Brazilians, obtained with samples from the five regions of the country, has indicated that, on average, European ancestors are responsible for nearly 80% of the genetic heritage of the population. The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%. The results, published by the scientific magazine 'American Journal of Human Biology' by a team of the Catholic University of Brasília, show that, in Brazil, physical indicators such as skin colour, colour of the eyes and colour of the hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person, which has been shown in previous studies"(regardless of census classification).&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160521090226/http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ciencia/ult306u633465.shtml] &lt;/ref&gt; "Ancestry informative SNPs can be useful to estimate individual and population biogeographical ancestry. Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F (st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions.'' Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19639555 | doi=10.1002/ajhb.20976 | volume=22 | issue=2 | title=Genetic composition of Brazilian population samples based on a set of twenty-eight ancestry informative SNPs | year=2010 | journal=Am.

In support of the dominant European heritage of Brazil, according to another autosomal DNA study (from 2009) conducted on a school in the poor periphery of Rio de Janeiro the "pardos" there were found to be on average over 80% European, and the "whites" (who thought of themselves as "very mixed") were found out to carry very little Amerindian or African admixtures. "The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry", say the researchers. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than the students thought it would be. The "pardos" for example thought of themselves as ⅓ European, ⅓ African and ⅓ Amerindian before the tests, and yet their ancestry was determined to be at over 80% European. The "blacks" (pretos) of the periphery of Rio de Janeiro, according to this study, thought of themselves as predominantly African before the study and yet they turned out ''predominantly European'' (''at 52%''), the African contribution at 41% and the Native American 7%.&lt;ref name="meionews.com.br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www4.ensp.fiocruz.br"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unl"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/current/readings/santos-race-brazil.pdf|date=3 November 2009|title=Color, Race, and Genomic Ancestry in Brazil &amp;#124; Dialogues between Anthropology and Genetics|author1=Ricardo Ventura Santos |author2=Peter H.

An autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a pred. degree of European ancestry combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban
populations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.&lt;ref name="plosone"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075145|title=Revisiting the Genetic Ancestry of Brazilians Using Autosomal AIM-Indels | pmid=24073242|volume=8|year=2013|journal=PLOS ONE|pages=e75145|pmc=3779230 | last1 = Saloum | first1 =  | last2 = de Neves Manta | first2 = F | last3 = Pereira | first3 = R | last4 = Vianna | first4 = R | last5 = Rodolfo | first5 =  | last6 = de Araújo | first6 = A | last7 = Leite Góes | first7 = Gitaí D | last8 = Aparecida | first8 =  | last9 = da Silva | first9 = D | last10 = de Vargas Wolfgramm | first10 = E | last11 = da Mota Pontes | first11 = I | last12 = Ivan Aguiar | first12 = J | last13 = Ozório Moraes | first13 = M | last14 = Fagundes | first14 =  | last15 = de Carvalho | first15 = E | last16 = Gusmão | first16 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another autosomal study from 2008, by the University of Brasília (UnB), European ancestry dominates in the whole of Brazil (in all regions), accounting for 65,90% of heritage of the population, followed by the African contribution (24,80%) and the Native American (9,3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/5542/1/2008_NeideMOGodinho.pdf|title=the impact of migrations in the constitution of Latin American populations|website=Repositorio.unb.br|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An autosomal study from 2011 (with nearly almost 1000 samples from all over the country, "whites", "pardos" and "blacks" included, according to their respective proportions) has also concluded that European ancestry is the predominant ancestry in Brazil, accounting for nearly 70% of the ancestry of the population: "''In all regions studied, the European ancestry was predominant, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Northeast to 77.7% in the South''".&lt;ref name="plosone.org"/&gt; The 2011 autosomal study samples came from blood donors (the lowest classes constitute the great majority of blood donors in Brazil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amigodoador.com.br/estatisticas.html |title=Profile of the Brazilian blood donor |publisher=Amigodoador.com.br |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502213529/http://www.amigodoador.com.br/estatisticas.html |archivedate=2 May 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and also public health institutions personnel and health students.

According to an autosomal DNA study (from 2003) focused on the composition of the Brazilian population as a whole, "European contribution [...] is highest in the South (81% to 82%), and lowest in the North (68% to 71%). The African component is lowest in the South (11%), while the highest values are found in the Southeast (18–20%). Extreme values for the Amerindian fraction were found in the South and Southeast (7%-8%) and North (17%-18%)". The researchers were cautious with the results as their samples came from paternity test takers which may have skewed the results partly.&lt;ref name="hereditas"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hereditas.com.br/pdfs/AJHB-Callegari-Jacquesetal2003.pdf |date=25 October 2003 |title=Historical Genetics: Spatiotemporal Analysis of the Formation of the Brazilian Population |author=SIDIA M.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
'''Cypriot women''' were greatly affected by changes in the wake of World War II, as they received expanded access to education and increased participation in the national workforce. Cyprus women have made great advancements in their society not just pertaining to education and the workplace, but also more women are beginning to hold political offices as well.

==Population==
According to World Population Review, in 2014, the population in Cyprus was 1,153,058. Women make up 48.944% of the total population in Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cyprus Population 2014 - World Population Review|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/cyprus-population/|website = worldpopulationreview.com|accessdate = 2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Cypriot Women==
Even at the beginning of the 1990s, Cypriot women were still burdened with the expectation of safeguarding the honor of the family. According to tradition, a woman's duty was to protect herself against all criticism of sexual immodesty.

A study carried out in a farming community in the mid-1970s found that women were still expected to avoid any social contact with men that could be construed to have a sexual context. An expressed desire to participate in male society was seen to reflect poorly on a woman's honor, and virginity was seen by many villagers, both men and women, to be a precondition for marriage. The honor of a family, that is, the sense of dignity of its male members, depended on the sexual modesty and virtue of its women. These traditional attitudes have waned somewhat in recent decades, especially in urban areas, but were still prevalent in the early 1990s. Another indication of the conservative nature of Greek Cypriot society at the beginning of the 1990s was that the feminist movement in Cyprus was often the object of ridicule from both sexes. Nevertheless, women's increasing economic independence was a force for liberation in all sections of the population.
Women in Cyprus roles have changes and altered over the years. In the past, Cyprus women's main expectations were to get married and have children. Their schooling was little to none and many women did not work outside their homes. If you ask a women in Cyprus if her social role is different than that of men, many of them will disagree. Today, many Cyprus women have jobs outside of their homes and receive a higher education. Even so, women still continue to keep up with the domestic work that their home life requires of them. Something that hasn't changed in Cyprus is the idea that women should be seen not heard or listen rather than speak. Due to gender socialization, women in Cyprus are known to keep their goals and successes to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cypriot People &amp; Culture - Cyprus.com|url=http://www.cyprus.com/cypriot-people---culture.html|website = Cyprus.com|accessdate = 2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
At the beginning of the 20th century, the proportion of girls to boys enrolled in primary education was one to three. By 1943, some 80 percent of Cypriot girls attended primary school. When, in 1960, elementary education was made compulsory, the two sexes were equally enrolled. By the 1980s, girls made up 45 percent of those receiving secondary education. Only after the mid-1960s did women commonly leave Cyprus to receive higher education. In the 1980s, women made up about 32 percent of those studying abroad.

==Female employment==
The participation of Cyriot women in the workforce has been steadily increasing. In 1976 women's share in the workforce was 30 percent and a rise to 37 percent in 1985. Today women's share in the workforce is 44 percent. 62.1% of women between the ages of 15–64 years old are active in workforce.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women in Cyprus|url=http://cordelia.typepad.com/anastasia/2012/03/women-in-cyprus.html|website = Anastasia|accessdate = 2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyprus has long had a high degree of female participation in the workforce. There were great changes in the nature of female employment. Women's share of the urban workforce rose from 22 percent to 41 percent, while their share of the rural workforce fell from 51 percent to 44.4 percent. The decline in rural areas stemmed from the overall shift away 
from agricultural work, where women's contribution had always been vital, to employment in urban occupations such as manufacturing and services.

The occupational segregation of the sexes was still persistent in Cyprus at the beginning of the 1990s. Even though the participation of women in clerical jobs had more than doubled since the late 1970s, only one woman in fifteen was in an administrative or managerial position in 1985. Women's share of professional jobs increased to 39 percent by the mid-1980s, compared with 36 percent ten years earlier, but these jobs were concentrated in medicine and teaching, where women had traditionally found employment. In fields where men were dominant, women's share of professional positions amounted to only 11 percent, up from 8 percent in 1976. In the fields where women were dominant, men took just under half the professional positions.

Nonetheless, there is still room for improvement pertaining to the gender equality Cyprus women are experiencing in the workforce. Not only do Women represent 14.4% of high posts, women are also paid on average 24% less per hour compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The equal pay-equal work principal would help to solve this problem, but the women are generally in lower positions then men resulting in the unequal pay.

According to the 2006 Population Census, the unemployment rate for women was 19%, whereas for men it was 6%. In 2010, the unemployment rate was 17.5% for women a and 8.9% for men. Even though the unemployment rate for women is decreasing, the rate is still twice as high compared to men.

=== Welfare ===
Cypriot women enjoy the same rights to social welfare as men in such matters as social security payments, unemployment compensation, vacation time, and other common social provisions. In addition, after 1985 women benefited from special protective legislation that provided them with marriage and maternity grants that paid them 75 percent of their insurable earnings. Still, a large number of women, including the self-employed and unpaid family workers on farms, were not covered by the Social Insurance Scheme. These women constituted 28 percent of the economically active female population.

In 1985, the Republic of Cyprus ratified the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women. Despite ratification of this agreement, as of late 1990 there was no legislation in the Republic of Cyprus that guaranteed the right to equal pay for work of equal value, nor the right of women to the same employment opportunities.

== Violence Against Women in Cyprus ==
Studies show that socioeconomic patterns play a big role in [[violence against women]] in Cyprus, specifically domestic violence. Women who possess characteristics such as having little to no education, reside in Urban areas, are of older age, and struggle financially are said to be prone to domestic violence. Due to there not being a national survey conducted focusing on domestic violence against women in Cyprus, statistics and findings can only be discovered through the police or through Association of the Prevention and Handling of Violence in the Family. The reports to the police have drastically been increasing each year. In 2002, 538 cases were reported, whereas in 2008 that number almost doubled with 969 cases being reported. During the years between 2002-2008, 71.18 percent of the victims were women. During the years between 2004-2009, the number of cases triples and 80 percent of victims are women, whereas 8.6% of victims are men. Of these cases, 79 percent involved physical violence, 18.5 percent involved psychological violence, and 2.4 percent involved sexual violence. The annual report from Association of the Prevention and Handling of Violence in the Family reveals that out of a total of 1051 incidents, 815 of them include women between the ages of 41-50 who were abused. Furthermore. 96.1 percent of these incidents involve psychological violence and 78 percent reside with their attacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0362-3319}} issue=v51i0002 article=295&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{main article|Xhosa calendar}}
Xhosa is part of the branch of [[Nguni languages]], known as [[Zunda languages]], which also include [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Southern Ndebele language|Southern Ndebele]] and [[Northern Ndebele language|Northern Ndebele]].&lt;ref name="websters"&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/Xhosa-english/ Online Xhosa-English Dictionary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040413042205/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/Xhosa-english/ |date=13 April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zunda languages effectively form a dialect continuum of variously mutually intelligible varieties. 

Xhosa is, to some extent, mutually intelligible with [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Northern Ndebele language|Northern Ndebele]], and other Nguni languages to a lesser extent. Nguni languages are, in turn, part of the much larger group of [[Bantu languages]].&lt;ref name="ucla"&gt;[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=21&amp;menu=004 UCLA Xhosa Language Materials Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northernndebele.blogspot.com www.northernndebele.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Xhosa is the most widely distributed African language in South Africa, though the most widely spoken African language is Zulu.&lt;ref name="ucla"/&gt; It is the second most common home language in South Africa as a whole. {{As of|2003}} approximately 5.3 million Xhosa-speakers, the majority, live in the [[Eastern Cape]], followed by the [[Western Cape]] (approximately 2 million), [[Gauteng]] (671,045), the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] (246,192), [[KwaZulu-Natal]] (219,826), North West (214,461), [[Mpumalanga]] (46,553), the [[Northern Cape]] (51,228), and [[Limpopo]] (14,225).&lt;ref name="census"&gt;[http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/demographics/census-main.htm South Africa Population grows to 44.8 Million.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050522081642/http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/demographics/census-main.htm |date=22 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small but significant Xhosa community of about 200,000 in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;Hlenze Welsh Kunju, 2017 Isixhosa Ulwimi Lwabantu Abangesosininzi eZimbabwe: Ukuphila Nokulondolozwa Kwaso, PhD Dissertation, Rhodes University&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a small community of Xhosa speakers (18,000) live in [[Quthing District]], [[Lesotho]].&lt;ref name ="xho"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=xho Ethnologue report for language code:xho]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==

Xhosa has several [[dialect]]s. Maho (2009) lists [[Mpondo]] (Pondo), [[Xesibe]], Bomvana, [[Gaika people|Gaika]] (Ngqika), [[Gcaleka]], [[Thembu]], [[Mpondomise]], [[Ndlambe]], and [[Hlubi]].&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt;

Hlubi is the dialect in the former [[Ciskei]]; there is the more distinct [[Hlubi language]] further north, where Xhosa meets SeSotho.

==Phonology==
[[File:IbalilikaNomathemba.ogg|thumb|Spoken Xhosa]]

===Vowels===
Xhosa has an inventory of ten vowels: {{IPA|[a]}}, {{IPA|[ɛ~e]}}, {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[ɔ~o]}} and {{IPA|[u]}} written as ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'' and ''u'' in order, all occurring in both [[Long vowel|long]] and [[Short vowel|short]].

===Tones===
Xhosa is a [[tonal language]] with two inherent [[phoneme|phonemic]] tones: low and high. Tones are rarely marked in the written language, but they can be indicated ''a'' [à], ''á'' [á], ''â'' [áà], ''ä'' [àá]. Long vowels are [[phoneme|phonemic]] but are usually not written except for ''â'' and ''ä'', which are the results of [[gemination]] of two vowels, both with different tones; they have thus become long vowels with contour tones (''â'' high-low = falling, ''ä'' low-high = rising).

===Consonants===
Xhosa is rich in uncommon [[consonant]]s. Besides [[airstream mechanism|pulmonic egressive]] sounds, which are found in all spoken languages, it has 18 [[click consonant|clicks]] (in comparison, [[Juǀ'hoan dialect|Juǀ'hoan]], spoken by roughly 10,000 people in [[Botswana]] and [[Namibia]], has 48 clicks, and [[Taa language|Taa]], with roughly 4,000 speakers in [[Botswana]], has 83 click sounds, the largest consonant inventory of any known language). Also, Xhosa has [[ejective]]s and an [[implosive]]. Although 15 of the clicks also occur in Zulu, they are used less frequently than in Xhosa.

The first six are [[dental click]]s (represented by the letter "c"), made with the tongue on the back of the teeth, and they are similar to the sound represented in English by "tut-tut" or "tsk-tsk" to reprimand someone. The next six are [[alveolar lateral click|lateral]] (represented by the letter "x"), made by the tongue at the sides of the mouth, and they are similar to the sound used to call horses. The last six are [[postalveolar click|alveolar]] (represented by the letter "q"), made with the tip of the tongue at the roof of the mouth, and they sound somewhat like a cork pulled from a bottle.

The following table lists the consonant phonemes of the language, with the pronunciation in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] on the left and the orthography on the right:

#Two additional consonants, {{IPA|[r]}} and {{IPA|[r̤]}}, are found in borrowings. Both are spelled ''r''.
#Two additional consonants, {{IPA|[ʒ]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ̈]}}, are found in borrowings. Both are spelled ''zh''.
#Two additional consonants, {{IPA|[dz]}} and {{IPA|[dz̤]}}, are found in loans. Both are spelled ''dz''.
#An additional consonant, {{IPA|[ŋ̈]}} is found in loans. It is spelled ''ngh''.

In addition to the ejective affricate {{IPA|[tʃʼ]}}, the spelling ''tsh'' may also be used for either of the aspirated affricates {{IPA|[tsʰ]}} and {{IPA|[tʃʰ]}}.

The breathy voiced glottal fricative {{IPA|[ɦ]}} is sometimes spelled ''h''.

The ejectives tend to be elective only in careful pronunciation or in salient positions and, even then, only for some speakers. Otherwise, they tend to be [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] (plain) stops. Similarly, the tenuis (plain) clicks are often glottalised, with a long [[voice onset time]], but that is uncommon.

The murmured clicks, plosives and affricates are only partially voiced, with the following vowel murmured for some speakers. That is, ''da'' may be pronounced {{IPA|[dʱa̤]}} (or, equivalently, {{IPA|[d̥a̤]}}). They are better described as [[slack voice]]d than as breathy voiced. They are truly voiced only after nasals, but the oral occlusion is then very short in stops, and it usually does not occur at all in clicks. Therefore, the absolute duration of voicing is the same as in tenuis stops. (They may also be voiced between vowels in some speaking styles.) The more notable characteristic is their [[depressor consonant|depressor]] effect on the tone of the syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Michael Jessen|author2=Justus C. Roux|year=2002|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095447001901500|title=Voice quality differences associated with stops and clicks in Xhosa|journal=[[Journal of Phonetics]]|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|volume=30|issue=1|pages=1-52|doi=10.1006/jpho.2001.0150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consonant changes with prenasalisation====
{{Main|Fortition}}
When consonants are [[prenasalized stop|prenasalised]], their pronunciation and spelling may change. The murmur no longer shifts to the following vowel. Fricatives become affricated and, if voiceless, they become ejectives as well, at least with some speakers: ''mf'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ɱp̪fʼ]}}, ''ndl'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ndɮ]}}, ''n+hl'' becomes ''ntl'' {{IPA|[ntɬʼ]}}, ''n+z'' becomes ''ndz'' {{IPA|[ndz]}}, ''etc.'' The orthographic ''b'' in ''mb'' is the voiced plosive {{IPA|[mb]}}.

When voiceless clicks (''c, x, q'') are prenasalised, the silent letter ''k'' is added (''nkc, nkx, nkq'') to prevent confusion with the nasal clicks ''nc, nx, nq''.

==Morphology==
In keeping with many other [[Southern Bantu languages]], Xhosa is an [[agglutinative]] language, with an array of [[prefixes]] and [[suffixes]] that are attached to [[root word]]s. Like in other Bantu languages, nouns in Xhosa are classified into [[Noun class|morphological classes]], or [[Gender (grammar)|genders]] (15 in Xhosa), with different prefixes for both singular and plural. Various parts of speech that qualify a [[noun]] must agree with the noun according to its gender. Agreements usually reflect part of the original class with which the word agrees. The [[word order]] is [[subject–verb–object]], like in English.

The [[verb]] is modified by affixes to mark subject, object, tense, aspect and mood. The various parts of the sentence must agree in both class and number.&lt;ref name = "ucla"/&gt;

===Nouns===

The Xhosa noun consists of two essential parts, the prefix and the stem. Using the prefixes, nouns can be grouped into noun classes, which are numbered consecutively, to ease comparison with other Bantu languages.

The following table gives an overview of Xhosa noun classes, arranged according to singular-plural pairs.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; '''is'''- and '''iz'''- replace '''isi'''- and '''izi'''- respectively before stems beginning with a vowel, e.g. {{lang|xh|'''&lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt;andla'''}}/{{lang|xh|'''&lt;u&gt;iz&lt;/u&gt;andla'''}} (hand/hands).

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The placeholder '''N''' in the prefixes '''iN'''- and '''iiN'''- for m, n or no letter at all.

&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Before monosyllabic stems in some words.

==History==
[[Image:Henry Hare Dugmore (ca. 1890).jpg|thumb|[[Henry Hare Dugmore]], an [[Englishman]] who became fluent in Xhosa, jointly produced the first translation of the [[Bible]] into the language in 1859]]
[[Image:Nelson Mandela.jpg|thumb|[[Nelson Mandela]] was a famous Xhosa man.]]

Xhosa-speaking people have inhabited coastal regions of southeastern Africa since before the 16th century. They refer to themselves as the ''[[Xhosa people|amaXhosa]]'' and their language as ''Xhosa''. AmaXhosa migrated to the east coast of Africa and came across Khoisan-speaking people; "as a result of this contact, the Xhosa people borrowed some Khoisan words along with their pronunciation, for instance, the click sounds of the Khoisan languages".&lt;ref name="Xhosa {{!}} About World Languages"/&gt;

The Bantu ancestor of Xhosa did not have clicks, which attests to a strong historical contact with a [[San language]] that did. An estimated 15% of Xhosa vocabulary is of San origin.&lt;ref name = "xho"/&gt; In the modern period, it has also borrowed, slightly, from both [[Afrikaans]] and English.

==Role in modern society==
The role of [[languages of Africa|indigenous languages]] in South Africa is complex and ambiguous. Their use in education has been governed by legislation, beginning with the [[Bantu Education Act, 1953]].&lt;ref name = "ucla"/&gt;

At present, Xhosa is used as the main language of instruction in many primary schools and some secondary schools, but is largely replaced by English after the early primary grades, even in schools mainly serving Xhosa-speaking communities. The language is also studied as a subject.

The language of instruction at [[List of universities in South Africa|universities in South Africa]] is English or Afrikaans, and Xhosa is taught as a subject, both for native and for non-native speakers.

Literary works, including prose and poetry, are available in Xhosa, as are newspapers and magazines. The first printed word in Xhosa came out in 1823 from the Lovedale Press in the Alice region of the Eastern Cape. But, as with any language, Xhosa had a rich history of oral traditions from which the society taught, informed, and entertained one another. The first Bible translation was in 1859, produced in part by [[Henry Hare Dugmore]].&lt;ref name = "xho"/&gt; The [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] broadcasts in Xhosa on both radio (on Umhlobo Wenene FM) and television, and films, plays and music are also produced in the language. The best-known performer of Xhosa songs outside South Africa was [[Miriam Makeba]], whose ''[[The Click Song|Click Song #1]]'' (Xhosa ''Qongqothwane'') and "Click Song #2" (''Baxabene Ooxam'') are known for their large number of click sounds.

{{As of|1996|alt=In 1996}}, the literacy rate for first-language Xhosa speakers was estimated at 50%.&lt;ref name = "xho"/&gt;

===Anthem===

''[[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika]]'' is part of the [[national anthem of South Africa]], national anthem of [[Tanzania]] and [[Zambia]], and the former anthem of [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Namibia]]. It is a [[Methodist]] hymn written in Xhosa by [[Enoch Sontonga]] in 1897. The original stanza was:

: ''Nkosi, sikelel' iAfrika;''
: ''Maluphakamis' uphondo lwayo;''
: ''Yiva imithandazo yethu''
: ''Nkosi sikelela, thina lusapho lwayo.''

: Lord, bless Africa;
: May her horn rise high up;
: Hear Thou our prayers
: Lord, bless us, your family.

Additional stanzas were written later by Sontonga and other writers, with the original verse translated into Sotho and Afrikaans, as well as English.

=== In popular culture ===
In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' and ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', the language spoken in the fictional African nation of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] is Xhosa. This came about because South African actor [[John Kani]], a native of the Eastern Cape province who plays Wakandan King T'Chaka, speaks some Xhosa and suggested that the directors of ''Civil War'' incorporate dialogue in the language. For ''Black Panther'', director [[Ryan Coogler]] “wanted to make it a priority to use Xhosa as much as possible” in the script, and provided dialect coaches for the film's actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/wakanda-black-panther.html|title=Wakanda Is a Fake Country, but the African Language in ‘Black Panther’ Is Real|last=Eligon|first=John|date=2018-02-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
