'''Ahmed Harara''' ([[Egyptian Arabic]]: '''"أحمد محمد علي "حرارة''', born February 12, 1980) is an Egyptian political activist who was blinded in both eyes in separate protesting incidents during the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://wiki.aucegypt.edu/isqatalnizam/index.php/Ahmad_Harara  | work= Isquat al-Nizam | title= Ahmed Harara }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname 'Harara' means heat and Ahmed was given the name due to always being on the first lines and really always being loud and so always encouraged others

== About ==
The former dentist became a symbol of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|25 January Revolution]] in which protestors called for the removal of President [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Harara did not attend the protests until he realized that the protests were about changing the entire regime, not just a minister.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2101745_2102138_2102236,00.html | work= Time Magazine | title= Why I Protest: Ahmed Harara of Egypt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Injuries ==
Harara sustained injuries that left him blind.

===Right Eye===
On January 28, 2011, known as the Friday of Rage, protesters clashed with police on the Qasr El Nile Bridge. Harara described how he felt it was the first day all of Egypt showed up. Harara was shot in the face with a shotgun and after three days in a coma woke up in the hospital. Doctors removed the tiny pelts which caused 64 lacerations to his face, 6 were taken from his neck, and 4 had injured his lungs.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

===Left Eye===
On November 19, 2011 Harara was shot a second time while demonstrating on Mohamed Mahmoud St. near Tahrir Square, but this shotgun was loaded with one large pellet, which hit him directly in the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3QNDRTWYHo | work= Amnesty International | title= Ahmed Harara: One year after the "25 January Revolution" }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convalescence===
Harara plans to undergo transplant surgery in Germany, and if that is unsuccessful, he will learn [[braille]] so he can find work.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

== Honors ==
Harara was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year in 2011.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

'''Alexander Dubček''' ({{IPA-sk|ˈalɛksandɛr ˈduptʃɛk}}; 27 November 1921 – 7 November 1992) was a [[Slovaks|Slovak]] politician who served as the First secretary of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSČ) (de facto leader of [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]) from January 1968 to April 1969. He attempted to reform the [[Politics of Communist Czechoslovakia|communist government]] during the [[Prague Spring]] but was forced to resign following the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Warsaw Pact invasion]] in August of 1968.

During his leadership, under the slogan of "''[[Socialism with a human face]]''", Czechoslovakia lifted [[censorship]] on the media and liberalized Czechoslovak society, fuelling the so-called [[Czechoslovak New Wave|New Wave]] in Czechoslovak filmography. However, he was put under pressure by [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] voices inside the party as well as the Soviet leadership, who disliked the direction the country was taking and feared that Czechoslovakia could loosen ties with the [[Soviet Union]] and become more [[Westernization|westernized]]. As a result, the country was [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invaded by the other Warsaw Pact countries]] on 20–21 August 1968, effectively ending the process known as the [[Prague Spring]]. Dubček resigned in April 1969 and was succeeded by [[Gustáv Husák|Gustav Husák]], who initiated ''[[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|normalization]]''. Dubček was then expelled from the Communist Party in 1970.

Later, after the [[Velvet revolution|overthrow of the communist regime in 1989]], he was Chairman of the [[Federal Assembly (Czechoslovakia)|federal Czechoslovak parliament]]. Also in 1989, the [[European Parliament]] awarded Dubček the [[Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought]].&lt;ref name=dk98&gt;{{citation |title=Sakharov Prize Network|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/intcoop/sakharov/laureates/alexander_en.html|author=European Parliament|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Alexander Dubček was born in Czechoslovakia on 27 November 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Political Biography|year=1998|publisher=OUP|location=Oxford|page=152|url=https://www.questia.com/read/34683530/a-dictionary-of-political-biography|author=Dennis Kavanagh|accessdate=1 September 2013|chapter=Dubcek, AAlexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When he was three, the family moved to the Soviet Union, in part to help build socialism and in part because jobs were scarce in Czechoslovakia; so that he was raised until 12 in the [[Kirghiz SSR]] of the [[Soviet Union]] (now [[Kyrgyzstan]]) as a member of the [[Esperanto culture|Esperantist]] and [[Ido (language)|Idist]] industrial cooperative [[Interhelpo]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Viney, 'Alexander Dubcek', ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' 1 (1968) p. 17-19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, the family moved to [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky, now Nizhny Novgorod]], and in 1938 returned to Czechoslovakia.

During the Second World War, Alexander Dubček joined the underground resistance against the wartime pro-German [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak state]] headed by [[Jozef Tiso]]. In August 1944, Dubček fought in the [[Jan Žižka partisan brigade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirschbaum |first1=Stanislav J. |title=A History of Slovakia: The Struggle for Survival |date=2016 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=9781250114754 |page=239 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzb-CwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Jan+%C5%BDi%C5%BEka+Partisan+brigade&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Slovak National Uprising]] and was wounded twice, while his brother, Július, was killed.&lt;ref&gt;D. Viney, 'Alexander Dubcek', ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' 1 (1968) p. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
During the war, Alexander Dubček joined the [[Communist Party of Slovakia (1939)|Communist Party of Slovakia]] (KSS),&lt;ref&gt;B. Wasserstein, ''Barbarism &amp; Civilization'' (Oxford 2007) p. 598&lt;/ref&gt; which had been created after the formation of the Slovak state and in 1948 was transformed into the Slovak branch of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] (KSČ).

After the war, he steadily rose through the ranks in [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)|Communist Czechoslovakia]]. From 1951 to 1955 he was a member of the National Assembly, the parliament of Czechoslovakia. In 1953, he was sent to the Moscow Political College, where he graduated in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;D. Viney, 'Alexander Dubcek', ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' 1 (1968) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1955 he joined the Central Committee of the Slovak branch and in 1962 became a member of the presidium. In 1958 he also joined the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]], which he served as a secretary from 1960 to 1962 and as a member of the presidium after 1962. From 1960 to 1968 he once more was a member of the federal parliament.

In 1963, a power struggle in the leadership of the Slovak branch unseated Karol Bacílek and Pavol David, hard-line allies of [[Antonín Novotný]], First Secretary of the KSČ and President of Czechoslovakia. In their place, a new generation of Slovak Communists took control of party and state organs in Slovakia, led by Alexander Dubček, who became First Secretary of the Slovak branch of the party.&lt;ref&gt;B. Wasserstein, ''Barbarism &amp; Civilization'' (Oxford 2007) p. 598&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Dubček's leadership, Slovakia began to evolve toward political liberalization. Because Novotný and his [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] predecessors had denigrated Slovak "bourgeois nationalists", most notably [[Gustáv Husák]] and [[Vladimír Clementis]], in the 1950s, the Slovak branch worked to promote Slovak identity. This mainly took the form of celebrations and commemorations, such as the 150th birthdays of 19th century leaders of the Slovak National Revival [[Ľudovít Štúr]] and [[Jozef Miloslav Hurban]], the centenary of the [[Matica slovenská]] in 1963, and the twentieth anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising. At the same time, the political and intellectual climate in Slovakia became freer than that in the Czech Lands.&lt;ref&gt;D. Viney, 'Alexander Dubcek', ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' 1 (1968) p. 23-4&lt;/ref&gt;  This was exemplified by the rising readership of ''Kultúrny život'', the weekly newspaper of the Union of Slovak Writers, which published frank discussions of liberalization, federalization and democratization, written by the most progressive or controversial writers – both Slovak and Czech. ''Kultúrny život'' consequently became the first Slovak publication to gain a wide following among Czechs.

==Prague Spring==
{{Main|Prague Spring}}
[[File:Alexander Dubček, památník poblíž místa nehody.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Monument to Alexander Dubček]] The Czechoslovak planned economy in the 1960s was in serious decline and the imposition of central control from [[Prague]] disappointed local Communists, while the [[destalinization]] program caused further disquiet. In October 1967, a number of reformers, most notably [[Ota Šik]] and Alexander Dubček, took action: they challenged First Secretary [[Antonín Novotný]] at a Central Committee meeting.&lt;ref&gt;B. Wasserstein, ''Civilisation and Barbarism'' (Oxford 2007) p. 598&lt;/ref&gt; Novotný faced a mutiny in the Central Committee, so he secretly invited [[Leonid Brezhnev]], the Soviet leader, to make a whirlwind visit to Prague in December 1967 in order to shore up his own position. When Brezhnev arrived in Prague and met with the Central Committee members, he was stunned to learn of the extent of the opposition to Novotný, leading Brezhnev to opt for non-interference,&lt;ref&gt;D. Viney, 'Alexander Dubcek', ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' 1 (1968) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; and paving the way for the Central Committee to force Novotný's resignation. Dubček, with his background and training in Russia, was seen by the USSR as a safe pair of hands. “Our Sasha”&lt;ref&gt;Brezhnev, quoted in B. Wasserstein, ''Civilisation and Barbarism'' (Oxford 2007) p. 598 and p. 603&lt;/ref&gt; became the new First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia on 5 January 1968.

The period following Novotný's downfall became known as the [[Prague Spring]]. During this time, Dubček and other reformers sought to liberalize the Communist government—creating "socialism with a human face".&lt;ref&gt;B. Wasserstein, ''Civilisation and Barbarism'' (Oxford 2007) p. 600&lt;/ref&gt; Though this loosened the party's influence on the country, Dubček remained a devoted Communist and intended to preserve the party's rule. However, during the Prague Spring, he and other reform-minded Communists sought to win popular support for the Communist government by eliminating its worst, most repressive features, allowing greater freedom of expression and tolerating political and social organizations not under Communist control.&lt;ref&gt;B. Wasserstein, ''Civilisation and Barbarism'' (Oxford 2007) p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; "Dubček! [[Ludvík Svoboda|Svoboda]]!"&lt;ref&gt;Lost World Of Communism (Czechoslovakia), BBC (Documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; became the popular refrain of student demonstrations during this period,{{citeneeded|date=April 2017}} while a poll gave him 78% public support.&lt;ref&gt;B. Wasserstein, ''Civilisation and Barbarism'' (Oxford 2007) p. 601&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Dubček found himself in an increasingly untenable position. The program of reform gained momentum, leading to pressures for further liberalization and democratization. At the same time, hard-line Communists in Czechoslovakia and the leaders of other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries pressured Dubček to rein in the Prague Spring. Though Dubček wanted to oversee the reform movement, he refused to resort to any draconian measures to do so, while still stressing the leading role of the Party and the centrality of the Warsaw Pact.&lt;ref&gt;D. Viney, 'Alexander Dubcek', ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' 1 (1968) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet leadership tried to slow down or stop the changes in Czechoslovakia through a series of negotiations. The Soviet Union agreed to bilateral talks with Czechoslovakia in July at Čierna nad Tisou, near the Slovak-Soviet border.&lt;ref&gt;B. Wasserstein, ''Civilisation and Barbarism'' (Oxford 2007) p. 601&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, Dubček tried to reassure the Soviets and the Warsaw Pact leaders that he was still friendly to Moscow, arguing that the reforms were an internal matter. He thought he had learned an important lesson from the failing of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], in which the leaders had gone as far as withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact.  Dubček believed that the Kremlin would allow him a free hand in pursuing domestic reform as long as Czechoslovakia remained a faithful member of the Soviet bloc. Despite Dubček's continuing efforts to stress these commitments, Brezhnev and other Warsaw Pact leaders remained wary, seeing a free press as threatening an end to one-party rule  in Czechoslovakia, and (by extension) elsewhere in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;B. Wasserstein, ''Civilisation and Barbarism'' (Oxford 2007) p. 605&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downfall==
On the night of 20–21 August 1968, [[Warsaw Pact]] forces except [[Romania|Romania]] entered Czechoslovakia. The occupying armies quickly seized control of Prague and the Central Committee's building, taking Dubček and other reformers into Soviet custody. But, before they were arrested, Dubček urged the people not to resist militarily, on the grounds that “presenting a military defence would have meant exposing the Czech and Slovak peoples to a senseless bloodbath”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in  B. Wasserstein, ''Civilisation and Barbarism'' (Oxford 2007) p. 605&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the day, Dubček and the others were taken to Moscow on a Soviet military transport aircraft (reportedly one used in the invasion).

The inspired non-violent resistance of the Czech and Slovak population, which delayed full loss of control to the Warsaw Pact forces for a full eight months (in contrast to the Soviet military's estimate of four days), became a prime example of [[civilian-based defense]]. A latter-day [[Good Soldier Schweik]] wrote mockingly of  “the comradely pranks of changing street names and road signs, of pretending not to understand Russian, and of putting out a great variety of humorous welcoming posters”&lt;ref&gt;'Josef Schweik', ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' 1 (1968) p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, radio stations called for the invaders to return home: “Long live freedom, Svoboda, Dubcek”.&lt;ref&gt;Documents,  ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' 1 (1968) p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless,  the reformers were forced to accede to Soviet demands, signing the [[Moscow protocols]], (with only [[František Kriegel]] refusing to sign): the tanks had crushed Dubcek's Prague Spring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jenny Diski]], ''The Sixties'' (London 2009) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubček and most of the reformers were returned to Prague on 27 August, and Dubček retained his post as the party's first secretary until April 1969;&lt;ref&gt;D. Viney, 'Alexander Dubcek', ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' 1 (1968) p. 36-7&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed, the achievements of the Prague Spring were not reversed overnight, but over a period of several months.

In January 1969, Dubček was hospitalized in Bratislava complaining of a cold and had to cancel a speech. Rumours sprang up that his illness was [[radiation sickness]] and that it was caused by radioactive [[strontium]] being placed in his soup during his stay in Moscow in an attempt to kill him. However, a U.S. intelligence report discounted this for lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindfully.org/Nucs/Surreptitious-Radiation-Administration.htm Radiation Sickness or Death Caused by Surreptitious Administration of Ionizing Radiation to an Individual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010903231650/http://www.mindfully.org/Nucs/Surreptitious-Radiation-Administration.htm |date=3 September 2001 }}.

Dubček was forced to resign as First Secretary in April 1969, following the [[Czechoslovak Hockey Riots]]. He was re-elected to the [[Federal Assembly of Czechoslovakia|Federal Assembly]] (as the federal parliament was now called) and became its chairman. He was later sent as ambassador to [[Turkey]] (1969–70),&lt;ref&gt;B. Wasserstein, ''Civilisation and Barbarism'' (Oxford 2007) p. 606&lt;/ref&gt; allegedly in the hope that he would defect to the West, which however did not occur. In 1970, he was expelled from the Communist party and lost his seats in the [[National Council of the Slovak Republic|Slovak parliament]] (which he had held continuously since 1964) and the Federal Assembly.

==Private citizen==
After his expulsion from the party, Dubček worked in the Forestry Service in Slovakia. He remained a popular figure among the Slovaks and Czechs he encountered on the job, using this reverence to procure scarce and hard-to-find materials for his workplace. Dubček and his wife, Anna, continued to live in a comfortable villa in a nice neighbourhood in [[Bratislava]]. In 1988, Dubček was allowed to travel to [[Italy]] to accept an honorary doctorate from [[Bologna University]], and, while there, he gave an interview with Italian newspaper ''[[L'Unità]]'', his first public remarks to the press since 1970. Dubček's appearance and interview helped to return him to international prominence.

In 1989, he was awarded the annual [[Sakharov Prize]] in its second year of existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/archive/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&amp;id=1003 "Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought: List of prize winners"], [[European Parliament]] webpage.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Velvet Revolution==

During the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, he supported the [[Public against Violence]] (VPN) and the [[Civic Forum]].   On the night of 24 November, Dubček appeared with [[Václav Havel]] on a balcony overlooking [[Wenceslas Square]], where he was greeted with tremendous applause from the throngs of protesters below and embraced as a symbol of democratic freedom.  Several onlookers even chanted, "''Dubček na hrad!''" ("Dubček to [[Prague Castle|the Castle]]"—i. e., Dubček for [[President of Czechoslovakia|President]]).  He disappointed the crowd somewhat by calling the revolution a chance to continue the work he had started 20 years earlier, and prune out what was wrong with Communism.  By that time, the demonstrators in Prague wanted nothing to do with Communism of any sort, even Dubček's "Socialism with a human face". Later that night, Dubček was on stage with Havel at the [[Laterna Magika]] theatre, the headquarters of Civic Forum, when the entire leadership of the Communist Party resigned, in effect ending Communist rule in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dubček was elected Chairman of the Federal Assembly (the Czechoslovak Parliament) on 28 December 1989, and re-elected in 1990 and 1992.

At the time of the overthrow of Communist party rule, Dubček described the Velvet Revolution as a victory for his ''humanistic socialist outlook''. In 1990, he received the International Humanist Award from the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]. He also gave the commencement address to the graduates of the Class of 1990 at The American University in Washington, D.C.; it was his first trip to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/12238-1 |title=Commencement Address - C-SPAN Video Library |publisher=C-spanvideo.org |date=13 May 1990 |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, he became leader of the [[Social Democratic Party of Slovakia]] and represented that party in the Federal Assembly. At that time, Dubček passively supported the union between Czechs and Slovaks in a single Czecho-Slovak federation against the (ultimately successful) [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|push towards an independent Slovak state]].

==Death==
[[File:Alexander Dubček Grave.JPG|right|thumb|260px|Dubček's grave]]
Dubček died on 7 November 1992, as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash that took place on 1 September on the [[Highway D1 (Czech Republic)|Czech D1 highway]], near [[Humpolec]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/08/world/alexander-dubcek-70-dies-in-prague.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 Alexander Dubcek, 70, Dies in Prague (New York Times, 8 November 1992)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kopanic, Michael J Jr, [http://www.ce-review.org/00/8/kopanic8.html "Case closed: Dubček's death declared an accident, not murder"], ''Central Europe Review'' (Vol 2, No 8),

'''Brigid Lyons Thornton''' (1896 – 15 November 1987) was a member of [[Cumann na mBan]], an officer in the [[Irish Free State Army]] and a physician.&lt;ref name="Irish times 2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=J St P C|title=(Dr) brigid lyons thornton.|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/530687494/|accessdate=14 November 2014|publisher=Irish Times|date=29 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Cowell" /&gt; Thornton was a rebellious character whom from a young age was involved in a Nationalist movement. Her first small involvement was selling badges and flags at the O'Donovan Rossa funeral.&lt;ref name="No ordinary women" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Brigid Lyons Thornton was born in Northyard Scramogue, County Roscommon in 1896.  She was the daughter of farmer and Fenian Patrick Lyons.&lt;ref name="John Cowell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cowell|first1=John|title=A Noontide Blazing: Brigid Lyons Thornton – Rebel, Soldier, Doctor|date=2005|publisher=Currach Press|location=Dublin|isbn= 9781856079181}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At a young age, Brigid moved to Longford to live with her uncle Frank McGuinness and his wife Kate, who paid for her secondary school education.  McGuinness is credited for Thornton's keen interest in politics and Irish history. In November 1934 Frank McGuinness died, having been a senator for five years and a renowned figure for his involvement in Irish history.&lt;ref name="John Cowell" /&gt; Brigid Lyons Thornton was a medical student and a member of [[Cumman na mBan]] who was involved with the Irish Volunteers during 1916.  She was arrested during the Easter Rising and interned in [[Kilmainham Gaol]] along with other members of the Irish Volunteers.

==Revolutionary==
She graduated from medical school, Galway in 1922 being the youngest medical student there.&lt;ref name="Irish Tmes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anonymous|first1=Anonymous|title=An irishwoman's diary|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/309112417/|accessdate=14 November 2014|publisher=Irish times|date=10 November 2008|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became the only commissioned female officer ever in the new [[Irish Free State Army]].  She and Edward Thornton met when Brigid became ill with tuberculosis and was sent to Switzerland with other officers who had a similar condition.  During this time Thornton learned how to treat Tuberculosis while she was a patient.  This would be a significant advantage in later years.  She took her diploma in public health in 1927 and then entered the public health service.  She began in the public health service, County Kildare, later moving to County Cork until she finally ended up in Dublin where she worked until retirement.  Brigid Thornton helped to treat many infectious diseases.&lt;ref name="Irish times 2" /&gt;

==Marriage==
Thornton married captain Edward Thornton on 10 October 1925, in Dublin, at the Chapel of St Kevin in the Pro Cathedral.  The ceremony was a quiet reunion of family and friends. Her husband returned to Switzerland to heal from TB and was later released and cured. He became a lawyer.  Thornton attended the National University in 1947 and finished a postgraduate degree in Public Health.  Thornton was very passionate about her work in the public health system in Ireland, she resided permanently on home ground; meanwhile her husband resided in Switzerland for most of the winter months, he worked as a lawyer and their relationship was maintained through letter writing and yearly visits form Captain Thornton to Ireland.&lt;ref name="John Cowell" /&gt; They are buried alongside each other in Toomore Cemetery.&lt;ref name="No ordinary women" /&gt;

==1916 Easter Rising==
Brigid returns to Longford when she hears the news of The 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. Her uncle Joe McGuinness was serving in the Four Courts along with [[Patrick Pearse]], [[James Connolly]] and [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]].&lt;ref name="Irish Tmes" /&gt; Brigid decides to join with Uncle Frank and the volunteers he had gathered in Dublin for the week.  Their car was believed to be rejected to enter the Four Courts and by some means the crew was able to pass the barricade, and Brigid along with Cumann na mBan provided food and took care of the wounded rebels. She acted as a nurse to the First Battalion of volunteers who had taken possession of the Four Courts and adjoining streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sayers|first1=Rachel|title=Brigid Lyons Thornton: Rebel, Soldier and Doctor|url=http://www.womensmuseumofireland.ie/articles/brigid-lyons-thornton|website=Women's Museum of Ireland|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the surrender, she was put in jail in Kilmainham with her comrades and during the imprisonment she heard that 14 of her idols were shot. After her release from the jail, she returned to continue studying medicine in Galway.

== Revolutionary activities ==
The involvement of Thornton in female activist activities in the late ninetieth century was a feat in itself as politics, religion and education were a conservative male dominated preserve.  Patriotism found her involved in [[Sinn Féin]] and [[Cumann na mBan]].  Women were limited by their male counterparts in the scope of their revolutionary activities.  In spite of this Thornton contributed as a rebel, soldier and commissioned medical officer.  In 1917 she set up a group of Cumann na mBan in Galway.  Despite her revolutionary activities as a dispatch carrier and involvement in the Easter Rising in 1916, which subsequently saw her imprisonment, Thornton qualified in 1922 at the rank of First Officer.  Later she was commissioned by Michael Collins to become the first and only woman to be accepted as a female officer in the Free State Army.  She was part of the medical services that formed the corps, when it was time to establish a permanent, new all Irish Medical Service in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;John Cowell, ''A Nootide Blazing, Brigid Lyons Thornton, Rebel, soldier, Doctor''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical career ==
Thornton dedicated her life to both revolutionary activities and the medical sector; she was a practitioner, lecturer and researcher.  Her involvement as a doctor was not only hospital work, but also as a volunteer.  She was an avid educator of women on the importance of hygiene in the development of children and factors of disease that flourished in the impoverished slums of the inner city and surrounding suburbs.  This work was marginalised by the lack of funds for a public health service to help ordinary people.  Clean water was a commodity at this time and a strain of [[gastroenteritis]] was the cause of death of many babies.&lt;ref name="John Cowell" /&gt; In her youth Thronton had expressed the passion to be become a teacher but as women's role in society changed, society's constraints became less stringent, she could study medicine and pursue greater participation in this area.  This devotion and patriotism to her country established her name in history.  This involvement matched her commitment to revolution.

Lyons acquired a county scholarship to study an undergraduate degree in Medicine in University College Galway in 1917, where she graduated in 1922.  She also received a Postgraduate Diploma in public health from The National University of Ireland in 1927, known as University College Dublin (UCD).  In the 1950s when vaccines were developed and distributed to the general public, Thornton helped combat the [[Tuberculosis]] epidemic in Ireland and became involved in the pioneering of the BGG vaccination as she herself had been plagued by the illness alongside her husband Edward.  A team of fifteen members were dispersed throughout Ireland setting out to accomplish what would become a massive feat in medical history.&lt;ref name="John Cowell" /&gt; She dedicated her life to working in the public sector; in a number of areas including the Kildare and Cork Boards of Health as a medical officer, and she was assistant medical officer for the Dublin Health Authority.  Her other work titles included medical inspector at the Carnegie Centre in Dublin.&lt;ref name="No ordinary women"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCool|first1=Brigid|title=No ordinary Women|date=2003|publisher=O'Brien Press ltd|location=Dublin|isbn=0-86278-813-7|edition=1st}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
During her life, Thornton as in her youth was a passionate contributed to the welfare of the people. She was a librarian in the Rotunda Hospital, where she was an advisor to the new doctors and was always up to date on new medical practices which were necessary in an age of medical discovery. Thornton was heavily involved in the Medical Benevolent Fund.&lt;ref name="John Cowell" /&gt; Thornton's retirement days were spent as a researcher in Trinity College Dublin.&lt;ref name="No ordinary women" /&gt;

== Death ==
Thronton lived a long life, surviving her husband Captain Edward Thornton who died in 1946, the couple had no children.  She had suffered ill health in her late seventies and retired, nevertheless she continued to work as a volunteer in The Rotunda Maternity Hospital.&lt;ref name="John Cowell" /&gt; Lyons died of cardiac-respiratory arrest, as stated on her death certificate, on 15 November 1987 at the age of 91.

Thornton was buried on the 71st anniversary of the [[Easter Rising]] in Toomore Cemetery, Foxford, County Mayo.&lt;ref name="John Cowell" /&gt; Members of the Western Command rendered her military honours at her burial and her coffin was draped in the tricolour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langton|first1=James|title=Dr. Brigid Lyons-Thornton|url=http://irishvolunteers.org/2013/08/brigid-lyons-thornton/|website=Irish Volunteers|accessdate=25 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129122919/http://irishvolunteers.org/2013/08/brigid-lyons-thornton/|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oscar-Claude Monet''' ({{IPAc-en|m|oʊ|ˈ|n|eɪ}}; {{IPA-fr|klod mɔnɛ|lang}}; 14 November 1840&amp;nbsp;– 5 December 1926) was a French painter, a founder of French [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painting and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to [[En plein air|plein air]] [[Landscape art|landscape painting]].&lt;ref&gt;House, John, et al.: ''Monet in the 20th century'', page 2, Yale University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=giverny&gt;{{cite web|url=http://giverny.org/monet/biograph/ |title=Claude MONET biography |publisher=Giverny.org |date=2 December 2009 |accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting ''Impression, soleil levant'' (''[[Impression, Sunrise]]''), which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the [[Salon de Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinthepicture.com/styles/Impressionism/|title=Impressionism – Styles &amp; Movements |website=www.artinthepicture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monet's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://site.artsheaven.com/blog/style-and-vision-of-claude-monet-impressionist-paintings/|title=Style And Vision Of Claude Monet Impressionist Paintings – Art &amp; Culture|date=16 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1883, Monet lived in [[Giverny]], where he purchased a house and property and began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works. In 1899, he began painting the water lilies, first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature and later in the series of large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life.

==Biography==

===Birth and childhood===
Claude Monet was born on 14 November 1840 on the fifth floor of 45 [[rue Laffitte]], in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris]].&lt;ref name="Tucker5"&gt;P. Tucker ''Claude Monet: Life and Art'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second son of Claude Adolphe Monet and Louise Justine Aubrée Monet, both of them second-generation Parisians. On 20 May 1841, he was baptized in the local parish church, [[Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, Paris|Notre-Dame-de-Lorette]], as Oscar-Claude, but his parents called him simply Oscar.&lt;ref name="Tucker5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sylvie Patin|Patin, Sylvie]], {{lang|fr|Monet : « un œil... mais, bon Dieu, quel œil ! »}}, collection "[[Découvertes Gallimard]]" (nº 131), série Arts. {{p.|14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (He signed his [[juvenilia]] "O.&amp;nbsp;Monet".) Despite being baptized Catholic, Monet later became an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Monet, Narcissus, and Self-Reflection: The Modernist Myth of the Self|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226475431|page=66|author=Steven Z.

In 1845, his family moved to [[Le Havre]] in [[Normandy]]. His father wanted him to go into the family's [[Ship chandling|ship-chandling]] and grocery business,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7cQqAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=monet+grocery+business+ships&amp;q=ship-chandlering|title=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|last=|first=|date=1974-01-01|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|isbn=978-0852292907|location=|page=347|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Monet wanted to become an artist. His mother was a singer, and supported Monet's desire for a career in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/claude-monet-9411771#early-life-and-career|title=Claude Monet Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=www.biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 1851, Monet entered Le Havre secondary school of the arts. Locals knew him well for his charcoal caricatures, which he would sell for ten to twenty [[franc]]s. Monet also undertook his first drawing lessons from [[Jacques-François Ochard]], a former student of [[Jacques-Louis David]]. On the beaches of Normandy around 1856 he met fellow artist [[Eugène Boudin]], who became his mentor and taught him to use oil paints. Boudin taught Monet "[[en plein air]]" (outdoor) techniques for painting.&lt;ref Name=guggenheim&gt;[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_165.html Biography for Claude Monet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120180622/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_165.html |date=20 January 2007 }} Guggenheim Collection. Retrieved 6 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Both received the influence of [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]].

On 28 January 1857, his mother died. At the age of sixteen, he left school and went to live with his widowed, childless aunt, Marie-Jeanne Lecadre.

===Paris and Algeria===
When Monet traveled to Paris to visit the [[Louvre]], he witnessed painters copying from the old masters. Having brought his paints and other tools with him, he would instead go and sit by a window and paint what he saw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLEpf5a49V0C&amp;pg=PA431 |first=Gary |last=Tinterow |title=Origins of Impressionism |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1994 |isbn=9780870997174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monet was in Paris for several years and met other young painters, including [[Édouard Manet]] and others who would become friends and fellow Impressionists.

After drawing a low ballot number in March 1861, Monet was drafted into the First Regiment of African Light Cavalry (''[[Chasseurs d'Afrique]]'') in [[Algeria]] for a seven-year period of military service. His prosperous father could have purchased Monet's exemption from conscription but declined to do so when his son refused to give up painting. While in Algeria Monet did only a few sketches of [[casbah]] scenes, a single landscape, and several portraits of officers, all of which have been lost. In a ''Le Temps'' interview of 1900 however he commented that the light and vivid colours of North Africa "contained the germ of my future researches".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Meyers, "Monet in Algeria", pp 19–24 "History Today" April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; After about a year of garrison duty in Algiers, Monet contracted typhoid fever and briefly went absent without leave. Following convalescence, Monet's aunt intervened to remove him from the army if he agreed to complete a course at an art school. It is possible that the Dutch painter [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]], whom Monet knew, may have prompted his aunt on this matter.

Disillusioned with the traditional art taught at art schools, in 1862 Monet became a student of [[Charles Gleyre]] in Paris, where he met [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Frédéric Bazille]] and [[Alfred Sisley]]. Together they shared new approaches to art, painting the effects of light ''[[en plein air]]'' with broken colour and rapid brushstrokes, in what later came to be known as [[Impressionism]].

[[File:Monet dejeunersurlherbe.jpg|thumb|''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe'' (right section), 1865–1866, with [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Frédéric Bazille]] and Camille Doncieux, first wife of the artist, [[Musée d'Orsay]], [[Paris, France|Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/index-of-works/notice.html?no_cache=1&amp;nnumid=025651&amp;cHash=22986e3842 Musée d'Orsay, ''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe'', Notice de l'œuvre, Iconographie]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In January 1865 Monet was working on a version of ''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe'', aiming to present it for hanging at the Salon, which had rejected Manet's ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' two years earlier.&lt;ref name=Stuckey11&gt;Charles F. Stuckey, pp. 11–16&lt;/ref&gt; Monet's painting was very large and could not be completed in time. (It was later cut up, with parts now in different galleries.) Monet submitted instead a painting of ''Camille'' or ''The Woman in the Green Dress'' (''La femme à la robe verte''), one of many works using his future wife, [[Camille Doncieux]], as his model. Both this painting and a small landscape were hung.&lt;ref name=Stuckey11/&gt; The following year Monet used Camille for his model in ''[[Women in the Garden]]'', and ''On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt'' in 1868. Camille became pregnant and gave birth to their first child, [[Jean Monet (son of Claude Monet)|Jean]], in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110003101 |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monet and Camille married on 28 June 1870, just before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War,&lt;ref name = "Stuckey"/&gt; and, after their excursion to London and Zaandam, they moved to Argenteuil, in December 1871. During this time Monet painted various works of modern life. He and Camille lived in poverty for most of this period. Following the successful exhibition of some maritime paintings, and the winning of a silver medal at Le Havre, Monet's paintings were seized by creditors, from whom they were bought back by a shipping merchant, Gaudibert, who was also a patron of Boudin.&lt;ref name= Stuckey11/&gt;

===Impressionism===

From the late 1860s, Monet and other like-minded artists met with rejection from the conservative [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]], which held its annual exhibition at the [[Salon de Paris]]. During the latter part of 1873, Monet, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], and [[Alfred Sisley]] organized the [[:fr:Société anonyme des artistes peintres, sculpteurs et graveurs|Société anonyme des artistes peintres, sculpteurs et graveurs]] (Anonymous Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers) to exhibit their artworks independently. At their first exhibition, held in April 1874, Monet exhibited the work that was to give the group its lasting name. He was inspired by the style and subject matter of previous modern painters Camille Pissarro and Edouard Manet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haine|first1=Scott|title=The History of France|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0313303289|page=112|edition=1st|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' was painted in 1872, depicting a [[Le Havre]] port landscape. From the painting's title the art critic [[Louis Leroy]], in his review, "L'Exposition des Impressionnistes," which appeared in ''[[Le Charivari]]'', coined the term "[[Impressionism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artchive.com/galleries/1874/74leroy.htm From John Rewald, ''The History of Impressionism'']&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended as disparagement but the Impressionists appropriated the term for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dhc-U0t14vMC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=ouis+Leroy,+Impression,+soleil+levant#v=onepage&amp;q=ouis+Leroy,+Impression,+soleil+levant&amp;f=false|title=Impressionism: A Centenary Exhibition, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 12, 1974–February 10, 1975|first1=Anne|last1=Distel|first2=Michel|last2=Hoog|first3=Charles S.|last3=Moffett|first4=Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York|last4=N.Y.)|date=11 April 1974|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0870990977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinthepicture.com/styles/Impressionism/ Impressionism – Overview] ARTinthePICTURE.com.

===Franco-Prussian War and Argenteuil===
After the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (19 July 1870), Monet and his family took refuge in England in September 1870,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/monet/ Monet, Claude] Nicolas Pioch, www.ibiblio.org, 19 September 2002. Retrieved 6 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied the works of [[John Constable]] and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]], both of whose landscapes would serve to inspire Monet's innovations in the study of colour. In the spring of 1871, Monet's works were refused authorisation for inclusion in the Royal Academy exhibition.&lt;ref name = "Stuckey"&gt;Charles Stuckey "Monet, a Retrospective", Hugh Lauter Levin Associates, 195&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1871, he left London to live in [[Zaandam]], in the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref name = "Stuckey"/&gt; where he made twenty-five paintings (and the police suspected him of revolutionary activities).&lt;ref&gt;The texts of seven police reports, written on 2 June – 9 October 1871 are included in ''Monet in Holland'', the catalog of an exhibition in the Amsterdam [[Van Gogh Museum]] (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; He also paid a first visit to nearby [[Amsterdam]]. In October or November 1871, he returned to France. From December 1871 to 1878 he lived at [[Argenteuil]], a village on the right bank of the [[Seine]] river near Paris, and a popular Sunday-outing destination for Parisians, where he painted some of his best-known works. In 1873, Monet purchased a small boat equipped to be used as a floating studio.&lt;ref name="Wattenmaker_98"&gt;Wattenmaker, Richard J.; [[Distel, Anne]], et al. (1993). ''Great French Paintings from the Barnes Foundation''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. p.  98. {{ISBN|0679409637}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the boat studio Monet painted landscapes and also portraits of Édouard Manet and his wife; Manet in turn depicted Monet painting aboard the boat, accompanied by Camille, in 1874.&lt;ref name="Wattenmaker_98"/&gt; In 1874, he briefly returned to Holland.&lt;ref&gt;His paintings are shown and discussed here {{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/a/netherlands/amsterdam-monet/amsterdam-monet.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524101553/http://www.livius.org/a/netherlands/amsterdam-monet/amsterdam-monet.html |archivedate=24 May 2007 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impressionism===

The first Impressionist exhibition was held in 1874 at 35 boulevard des Capucines, Paris, from 15 April to 15 May. The primary purpose of the participants was not so much to promote a new style, but to free themselves from the constraints of the [[Salon de Paris]]. The exhibition, open to anyone prepared to pay 60 francs, gave artists the opportunity to show their work without the interference of a jury.&lt;ref name="Denvir"&gt;Bernard Denvir, ''The Chronicle of Impressionism: A Timeline History of Impressionist Art'', Bulfinch Press Book, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denvir b"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vehtQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Chronicle+of+Impressionism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oSfQUqWvAYmK7AaWz4C4Bg&amp;redir_esc=y Bernard Denvir, ''The chronicle of impressionism: an intimate diary of the lives and world of the great artists''], Thames &amp; Hudson, Limited, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artchive.com/galleries/1874/74notes.htm#background|title=The First Impressionist Exhibition, 1874 – Notes|website=www.artchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renoir chaired the hanging committee and did most of the work himself, as others members failed to present themselves.&lt;ref name="Denvir" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Denvir b" /&gt;

In addition to ''[[Impression: Sunrise]]'' (pictured above), Monet presented four oil paintings and seven pastels. Among the paintings he displayed was ''The Luncheon'' (1868), which features Camille Doncieux and [[Jean Monet (son of Claude Monet)|Jean Monet]], and which had been rejected by the Paris Salon of 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staedelmuseum.de/sm/index.php?StoryID=1047&amp;ObjectID=249#sthash.20kjFV1h.dpuf|title=Das Städel Museum – Kunstmuseum in Frankfurt|website=Städel Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in this exhibition was a painting titled ''[[Boulevard des Capucines (Monet)|Boulevard des Capucines]]'', a painting of the boulevard done from the photographer [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar's]] apartment at no. 35. Monet painted the subject twice, and it is uncertain which of the two pictures, that now in the [[Pushkin Museum]] in Moscow, or that in the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], was the painting that appeared in the groundbreaking 1874 exhibition, though more recently the Moscow picture has been favoured.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j4F8cbbG5ocC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=claude+monet,+boulevard,+Pushkin+Museum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MZeunyUdaq&amp;sig=XC_G_tg2caIzaB1JifqugbHmznI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7GW7UsfrPKzb7Abe7YHQBA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=claude%20monet%2C%20boulevard%2C%20Pushkin%20Museum&amp;f=false Nathalia Brodskaya, ''Claude Monet'', Parkstone International, Jul 1, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FEXAfcxMpa4C&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=claude+monet,+boulevard,+Nelson-Atkins+Museum+of+Art,+first+exhibition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LWXo8oupp6&amp;sig=5oYTlvgOdY1eUzXzUy5g3Sl8MGA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ime7UuOkAciShgfttID4CA&amp;ved=0CHYQ6AEwEg#v=onepage&amp;q=claude%20monet%2C%20boulevard%2C%20Nelson-Atkins%20Museum%20of%20Art%2C%20first%20exhibition&amp;f=false Nathalia Brodskaïa, ''Impressionism'', Parkstone International, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, 165 works were exhibited in the exhibition, including 4 oils, 2 pastels and 3 watercolours by Morisot; 6 oils and 1 pastel by Renoir; 10 works by Degas; 5 by Pissarro; 3 by Cézanne; and 3 by Guillaumin. Several works were on loan, including Cézanne's ''Modern Olympia'', Morisot's ''Hide and Seek'' (owned by Manet) and 2 landscapes by Sisley that had been purchased by Durand-Ruel.&lt;ref name="Denvir" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Denvir b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="archives" /&gt;

The total attendance is estimated at 3500, and some works did sell, though some exhibitors had placed their prices too high. Pissarro was asking 1000 francs for ''The Orchard'' and Monet the same for ''Impression: Sunrise'', neither of which sold. Renoir failed to obtain the 500 francs he was asking for ''[[La Loge]]'', but later sold it for 450 francs to Père Martin, dealer and supporter of the group.&lt;ref name="Denvir" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Denvir b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="archives" /&gt;

In 1876, [[Camille Doncieux|Camille Monet]] became ill with [[tuberculosis]]. Their second son, [[Michel Monet|Michel]], was born on 17 March 1878. This second child weakened her already fading health. In the summer of that year, the family moved to the village of [[Vétheuil]] where they shared a house with the family of [[Ernest Hoschedé]], a wealthy department store owner and patron of the arts. In 1878, Camille Monet was diagnosed with uterine cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Jiminez, Jill Berk (2013). ''Dictionary of Artists' Models''.

Monet made a study in oils of his dead wife. Many years later, Monet confessed to his friend [[Georges Clemenceau]] that his need to analyse colours was both the joy and torment of his life. He explained,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I one day found myself looking at my beloved wife's dead face and just systematically noting the colours according to an automatic reflex!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Berger describes the work as "a blizzard of white, grey, purplish paint&amp;nbsp;... a terrible blizzard of loss which will forever efface her features. In fact there can be very few death-bed paintings which have been so intensely felt or subjectively expressive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=John|title=The Eyes of Claude Monet from Sense of Sight|year=1985|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0679737223|pages=194–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vétheuil===
After several difficult months following the death of Camille, Monet began to create some of his best paintings of the 19th century. During the early 1880s, Monet painted several groups of landscapes and seascapes in what he considered to be campaigns to document the French countryside. These began to evolve into series of pictures in which he documented the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons.

Monet's friend [[Ernest Hoschedé]] became bankrupt, and left in 1878 for Belgium. After the death of Camille Monet in September 1879, and while Monet continued to live in the house in Vétheuil, [[Alice Hoschedé]] helped Monet to raise his two sons, Jean and Michel. She took them to Paris to live alongside her own six children,&lt;ref name="monetalia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monetalia.com/biography.aspx |title=Biography of Oscar-Claude Monet, The Life and Work of Claude Monet |publisher=Monetalia.com |date= |accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blanche Hoschedé Monet|Blanche]] (who married Jean Monet), Germaine, [[Suzanne Hoschedé|Suzanne]], Marthe, Jean-Pierre, and Jacques. In the spring of 1880, Alice Hoschedé and all the children left Paris and rejoined Monet at Vétheuil.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Merrill Mount, ''Monet a biography'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] publisher, copyright 1966, pp. 309–322.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, all of them moved to [[Poissy]], which Monet hated. In April 1883, looking out the window of the little train between Vernon and Gasny, he discovered Giverny in [[Normandy]].&lt;ref name="monetalia1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="giverny1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://giverny.org/giverny/ |title=Monet's Village |publisher=Giverny |date=24 February 2009 |accessdate=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Merrill Mount, ''Monet a biography'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] publisher, copyright 1966, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; Monet, Alice Hoschedé and the children moved to [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]], then to the house in [[Giverny]], where he planted a large garden and where he painted for much of the rest of his life. Following the death of her estranged husband, Monet married Alice Hoschedé in 1892.&lt;ref name="guggenheim"/&gt;

===Monet's house and garden===
Monet rented and [[Fondation Monet in Giverny|eventually purchased a house and gardens]] in [[Giverny]]. At the beginning of May 1883, Monet and his large family rented the home and {{convert|2|acre|ha}} from a local landowner. The house was situated near the main road between the towns of [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]] and Gasny at [[Giverny]]. There was a barn that doubled as a painting studio, orchards and a small garden. The house was close enough to the local schools for the children to attend, and the surrounding landscape offered many suitable motifs for Monet's work.

The family worked and built up the gardens, and Monet's fortunes began to change for the better as his dealer, [[Paul Durand-Ruel]], had increasing success in selling his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Mathews Gedo, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXtbMrsjsOEC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=false ''Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist's Life''], University of Chicago Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0226284804}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1890, Monet was prosperous enough to buy the house, the surrounding buildings and the land for his gardens. During the 1890s, Monet built a greenhouse and a second studio, a spacious building well lit with skylights.
[[File:Monet's Garden 1989 Copyright Mitzi Humphrey.png|thumb|left|[[Fondation Monet in Giverny|Monet's Garden]] 1989]]
Monet wrote daily instructions to his gardener, precise designs and layouts for plantings, and invoices for his floral purchases and his collection of botany books. As Monet's wealth grew, his garden evolved. He remained its architect, even after he hired seven gardeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/travel/getaways/europe/articles/2007/05/20/monets_gardens_a_draw_to_giverny_and_to_his_art/|title=Monet's gardens a draw to Giverny and to his art|publisher=Globe Correspondents|date=20 May 2007|accessdate=13 October 2008 | first=Robert | last=Garrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monet purchased additional land with a water meadow. In 1893 he began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works. White water lilies local to France were planted along with imported cultivars from South America and Egypt, resulting in a range of colours including yellow, blue and white lilies that turned pink with age.&lt;ref name=AGV&gt;Art Gallery of Victoria, [http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/whats-on/exhibitions/exhibitions/monets-garden/explore/themes/waterlilies-symbol-of-the-orient-and-modern-science Monet's Garden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216191410/http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/whats-on/exhibitions/exhibitions/monets-garden/explore/themes/waterlilies-symbol-of-the-orient-and-modern-science |date=16 December 2013 }}, (retrieved 16 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 he began painting the water lilies, first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature, and later in the series of large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life. This scenery, with its alternating light and mirror-like reflections, became an integral part of his work. By the mid-1910s Monet had achieved

===Failing sight===
Monet's second wife, Alice, died in 1911, and his oldest son Jean, who had married Alice's daughter Blanche, Monet's particular favourite, died in 1914.&lt;ref name="guggenheim"/&gt; After Alice died, Blanche looked after and cared for Monet. It was during this time that Monet began to develop the first signs of [[cataract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Forge, Andrew, and Gordon, Robert, ''Monet'', page 224. Harry N. Abrams, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], in which his younger son Michel served and his friend and admirer [[Georges Clemenceau]] led the French nation, Monet painted a series of [[Salix babylonica|weeping willow]] trees as homage to the French fallen soldiers. In 1923, he underwent two operations to remove his cataracts. The paintings done while the cataracts affected his vision have a general reddish tone, which is characteristic of the vision of cataract victims. It may also be that after surgery he was able to see certain [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths of light that are normally excluded by the lens of the eye; this may have had an effect on the colours he perceived. After his operations he even repainted some of these paintings, with bluer water lilies than before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/medicalscience/story/0,9837,724257,00.html Let the light shine in] Guardian News, 30 May 2002.

===Death===
[[File:Giverny, Claude Monet Grave - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Monet family grave at Giverny]]
Monet died of [[lung cancer]] on 5 December 1926 at the age of 86 and is buried in the [[Giverny]] church cemetery.&lt;ref name="giverny1"/&gt; Monet had insisted that the occasion be simple; thus only about fifty people attended the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;P. Tucker ''Claude Monet: Life and Art'', p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; At his funeral, his long-time friend [[Georges Clemenceau]] removed the black cloth draped over the coffin, stating, "No black for Monet!" and replaced it with a flower-patterned cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McAuliffe |first= Mary |title= Dawn of the Belle Epoque: The Paris of Monet, Zola, Bernhardt, Eiffel, Debussy, Clemenceau, and Their Friends |location= Canberra |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |date = 2011| pages = 338 |format= Paperback |isbn= 978-1442209282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His home, garden, and waterlily pond were bequeathed by his son Michel, his only heir, to the French Academy of Fine Arts (part of the [[Institut de France]]) in 1966. Through the ''Fondation Claude Monet'', the house and gardens were opened for visits in 1980, following restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fondation-monet.fr/uk/?q=content/historical-record |title=Historical record |publisher=Fondation-monet.fr |accessdate=19 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720220020/http://www.fondation-monet.fr/uk/?q=content%2Fhistorical-record |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to souvenirs of Monet and other objects of his life, the house contains his collection of [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese woodcut prints]]. The house and garden, along with the Museum of Impressionism, are major attractions in [[Giverny]], which hosts tourists from all over the world.

==Monet's methods==
[[File:Claude Monet - Rouen Cathedral, Facade (Sunset).JPG|thumb|''Rouen Cathedral at sunset'', 1893, Musée Marmottan Monet. An example of the [[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral Series.]]]]

Monet has been described as "the driving force behind Impressionism".&lt;ref name="GJ"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Impressionist Painters|last = Jennings|first = Guy|publisher = Octopus Books|year = 1986|isbn = 978-0706426601|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crucial to the art of the Impressionist painters was the understanding of the effects of light on the local colour of objects, and the effects of the juxtaposition of colours with each other.&lt;ref name="HelenGardner"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art through the Ages|last = Gardner|first = Helen|publisher = Harcourt College Pub|year = 1995|isbn = 978-0155011410|location = |page = 669|edition = 10th Reiss}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monet's long career as a painter was spent in the pursuit of this aim.

In 1856, his chance meeting with [[Eugene Boudin]], a painter of small beach scenes, opened his eyes to the possibility of plein-air painting. From that time, with a short interruption for military service, he dedicated himself to searching for new and improved methods of painterly expression. To this end, as a young man, he visited the Paris Salon and familiarised himself with the works of older painters, and made friends with other young artists.&lt;ref name=GJ/&gt; The five years that he spent at [[Argenteuil]], spending much time on the River Seine in a little floating studio, were formative in his study of the effects of light and reflections. He began to think in terms of colours and shapes rather than scenes and objects. He used bright colours in dabs and dashes and squiggles of paint. Having rejected the academic teachings of Gleyre's studio, he freed himself from theory, saying "I like to paint as a bird sings."&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877 a series of paintings at St-Lazare Station had Monet looking at smoke and steam and the way that they affected colour and visibility, being sometimes opaque and sometimes translucent. He was to further use this study in the painting of the effects of mist and rain on the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the effects of atmosphere was to evolve into a number of series of paintings in which Monet repeatedly painted the same subject in different lights, at different hours of the day, and through the changes of weather and season. This process began in the 1880s and continued until the end of his life in 1926.

His first series exhibited as such was of [[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]], painted from different points of view and at different times of the day. Fifteen of the paintings were exhibited at the [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Galerie Durand-Ruel]] in 1891. In 1892 he produced what is probably his best-known series, twenty-six views of ''[[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]]''.&lt;ref name="HelenGardner" /&gt; In these paintings Monet broke with painterly traditions by cropping the subject so that only a portion of the façade is seen on the canvas. The paintings do not focus on the grand Medieval building, but on the play of light and shade across its surface, transforming the solid masonry.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Other series include ''[[Poplar Series (Monet)|Poplars]]'', ''Mornings on the Seine'', and the ''[[Water Lilies]]'' that were painted on his property at Giverny. Between 1883 and 1908, Monet traveled to the [[Mediterranean]], where he painted landmarks, landscapes, and seascapes, including a series of paintings in [[Venice, Italy|Venice]]. In London he painted four series: ''the [[London Parliament (Monet)|Houses of Parliament, London]]'', ''[[Charing Cross Bridge series (Monet)|Charing Cross Bridge]]'', ''Waterloo Bridge'', and ''Views of Westminster Bridge''. Helen Gardner writes:

{{quote|Monet, with a scientific precision, has given us an unparalleled and unexcelled record of the passing of time as seen in the movement of light over identical forms.&lt;ref name=HG&gt;Helen Gardner, ''Art through the Ages'', p. 669&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''François Gerard Marie Léotard''' (born 26 March 1942, in [[Cannes]]) is a retired French politician. Singer and actor [[Philippe Léotard]] (1940&amp;ndash;2001) was his brother.

Member of the [[Republican Party (France)|Republican Party]], the liberal-conservative component of the [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF), he appeared in the foreground of the political scene in the 1980s. He led a new generation of right-wing politicians, the "renovationmen", who opposed the old right-wing leaders [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]].

In 1981, he was selected to be one of the first ''Young Leaders'' of the [[French-American Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchamerican.org/young-leaders|title=Young Leaders|publisher=[[French-American Foundation]]|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His political career started with being elected as the Mayor of Fréjus in 1977. He served two terms as the deputy of Var.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gala.fr/l_actu/news_de_stars/francois_leotard_au_nom_du_frere_348196|title=François Léotard: au nom du frère - Gala|last=Média|first=Prisma|work=Gala.fr|access-date=2017-11-09|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culture Minister, from 1986 to 1988,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembleenationale.fr/11/tribun/fiches_id/1949.asp Assemblée nationale website]&lt;/ref&gt; he sold the main public TV channel [[TF1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ina.fr/economie-et-societe/vie-economique/video/CAB86011857/francois-leotard-privatisation-tf1.fr.html Video on Ina.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; He returned in the cabinet as Defense Minister, from 1993 to 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assembleenationale.fr/11/tribun/fiches_id/1949.asp Assemblée nationale website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/former-general-michel-aoun-elected-president-of-lebanon-1.2849764|title=Former general Michel Aoun elected president of Lebanon|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting the candidacy of [[Edouard Balladur]] in the [[French presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential election]], he was dismissed after Chirac's election. Elected president of the UDF in 1996, he could not prevent the split of this confederation two years later with [[Alain Madelin]]'s secession. This and the party's poor showing in the 1998 regional elections prompted his resignation. After a mission in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] in 2001 as representative of the [[European Union]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/cr-cafe/01-02/c0102008.asp ASSEMBLÉE NATIONALE, COMMISSION DES AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES, COMPTE RENDU N° 8]&lt;/ref&gt; he retired from politics. In 2003, he created together with other prominent European personalities the [[Medbridge Strategy Center]], whose goal is to promote dialogue and mutual understanding between Europe and the [[Middle-East]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medbridge.org/showpage.php/en/1/2/page.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He has since written several books.

'''Gerald Busby''' (born December 16, 1935) is a Texas-born American composer.

Busby was born in [[Tyler, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;In the interview with Adam Gopnik he indicated that there was a Baptist minister as part of his growing up.&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied piano as a child, playing with the [[Houston Symphony]] when he was fifteen.{{sfn|Gopnik|2015}} He attended Yale where he studied music in college, but once graduated, began working as a traveling salesman.{{sfn|Gopnik|2015}} At age 40 he had an "epiphany" and began to compose, a direction which surprised him.{{sfn|Rehrmann|2007}}

In 1977, with the assistance of [[Virgil Thomson]], he moved to the [[Hotel Chelsea]] in New York City where he has written most of his work.{{sfn|Gopnik|2015}} Living at the Hotel Chelsea brought him into contact with numerous cultural figures. One of them was dancer [[Rudolf Nureyev]] and his then-partner [[Wallace Potts]]. Potts gave [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]] a recording by Busby's music, which led to Busby writing the score for Taylor's dance ''Runes''.{{sfn|Gopnik|2015}} Regarding his scores for Paul Taylor's dance "Runes" and [[Robert Altman]]'s film ''[[3 Women]]'', Busby said "Those two pieces are acknowledged as masterpieces, so that I know they’ll last beyond me,” Mr. Busby said. “Not because what I did was a masterpiece, but I was part of it."{{sfn|Rehrmann|2007}}

In 1985 Busby was diagnosed with [[HIV]] as was his partner Samuel Byers.  Byers died on December 14, 1993; the couple had been together for 18 years. "Sam’s death was just unbearable...He lost his mind and withered away. I was there the whole time with him and taking care of him, so I just went nuts."{{sfn|Rehrmann|2007}} After a bout of depression and drug addiction, he became sober and began composing again. In 2007, his monthly income amounted to $658 from Social Security, $78 in disability payments, and $156 in food stamps.  Income from his music was undependable; in a good month he could get $1000, or nothing.The [[New York Times]] ran him as one of their "most neediest cases."{{sfn|Rehrmann|2007}} Through the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, Busby was able to receive $754.96 for digitizing recordings originally made on perishable cassette tape.{{sfn|Rehrmann|2007}}

Despite being HIV positive, he claims that his immune system has regenerated, something he attributes to his daily practice of [[reiki]].{{sfn|Gopnik|2015}} He continues to live at the Hotel Chelsea.{{sfn|Gopnik|2015}}

'''Gordon Lyon''' (also known by his [[pseudonym]] '''Fyodor Vaskovich''') is a network security expert,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/05/hakin9_silliness/|title=Experts troll 'biggest security mag in the world' with DICKish submission|date=2012-08-05|author=John Leyden|publisher=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Open-source software|open source]] programmer, writer, and [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]].  He authored the open source [[Nmap|Nmap Security Scanner]] and numerous books, web sites, and technical papers focusing on network security. Lyon is a founding member of the [[Honeynet project|Honeynet Project]] and was Vice President of [[Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility]].

==Personal life==
Lyon has been active in the network security community since the mid-1990s.  His ''handle'', Fyodor, was taken from Russian author [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].  Most of his programming is done in the [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and [[Perl]] programming languages.  He lives in [[Palo Alto, California]].

==Opposition to grayware==
In December 2011 Lyon published his strong dislike of the way [[Download.com]] started bundling [[Malware#Grayware|grayware]] with their installation managers and concerns over the bundled software, causing many people to spread the post on social networks, and a few dozen media reports. The main problem is the confusion between Download.com-offered content&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/12/download-com-bundling-toolbars-trojans/|title=Download.com Bundling Toolbars, Trojans?|author=Brian Krebs|authorlink=Brian Krebs|work=Krebs on security|date=2011-12-06|accessdate=2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=insecure&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insecure.org/news/download-com-fiasco.html#exec|title=Download.com Caught Adding Malware to Nmap &amp;amp; Other Software|date=2012-06-27|quote=we suggest avoiding CNET Download.com entirely|author=Gordon Lyon|authorlink=Gordon Lyon|accessdate=2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and software offered by original authors; the accusations included deception as well as copyright and trademark violation.&lt;ref name=insecure /&gt;

Lyon has lost control of the [[Nmap]] [[Sourceforge]] page, with Sourceforge taking over the project's page and offering [[adware]] wrapped download bundles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2015/q2/194|title=Sourceforge Hijacks the Nmap Sourceforge Account|date=3 June 2015|work=Seclists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/black-mirror-sourceforge-has-now-siezed-nmap-audit-tool-project/|title=Black "mirror": SourceForge has now seized Nmap audit tool project|author=Sean Gallagher|work=Ars Technica|date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Web sites==
Lyon maintains several network security web sites:
*Nmap.Org &amp;ndash; Host of the [[Nmap]] security scanner and its documentation
*SecTools.Org &amp;ndash; The top 100 network security tools (ranked by thousands of Nmap users)
*SecLists.Org &amp;ndash; Archive of the most common security mailing lists
*Insecure.Org &amp;ndash; His main site, offering security news/updates, exploit world archive, and other misc. security resources

==Published books==
Lyon has written and co-authored several books:
*''Know Your Enemy: Revealing the Security Tools, Tactics, and Motives of the Blackhat Community'' (Addison-Wesley, 2002, {{ISBN|0-201-74613-1}}), co-authored with other members of the [[Honeynet project|Honeynet Project]]. A 2nd edition is now available ({{ISBN|0-321-16646-9}}), as are [http://www.honeynet.org/book/index.html sample chapters].
*''Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent'' (Syngress, 2004, {{ISBN|1-931836-05-1}}).  Hacker fiction, but tries to stay realistic.  Co-authored with [[Kevin Mitnick]] and other hackers.  Gordon's chapter is [http://insecure.org/stc/ freely available online].
*''Nmap Network Scanning'' (Nmap Project, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-9799587-1-7}})

==Interviews==
Public interviews with Lyon/Vaskovich have been posted by SecurityFocus, Slashdot, Zone-H, TuxJournal, Safemode, and Google.  Many of these provide more personal details than his official bio page does.

==Conferences==
Lyon attends and speaks at many security conferences.  He has presented at [[DEF CON (convention)|DEFCON]], [[CanSecWest]], [[FOSDEM]], IT Security World, Security Masters' Dojo, [[ShmooCon]], IT-Defense, SFOBug, and others.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10747">'''Herculine Barbin''' (November 8, 1838– February 1868)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Foucault |first1=Michel |title=Herculine Barbin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxFjeOf02rgC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Herculine+Barbin+%22born%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HxsbrSrWyu&amp;sig=xS6ubGVmDm_5ZpAt_wYrL56LQeg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjf_pG_oYTeAhVKx1QKHTRvCw84ChDoATAIegQIAhAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Herculine%20Barbin%20%22born%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[French people|French]] [[intersex]] person who was [[sex assignment|determined]] as female at birth and raised in a convent, but was later reclassified as male by a court of law, after an affair and physical examination.

==Early life==
Most of what we know about Barbin comes from her later memoirs. '''Herculine Adélaîde Barbin''' was born in [[Saint-Jean-d'Angély]] in France in 1838. She was [[sex assignment|assigned]] as a girl and raised as such; her family referred to her as Alexina. Her family was poor but she gained a charity scholarship to study in the school of an [[Ursulines|Ursuline]] convent.

According to her account, she had a crush on an aristocratic female friend in school. She regarded herself as unattractive but sometimes slipped into her friend's room at night and was sometimes punished for that. However, her studies were successful and in 1856, at the age of seventeen she was sent to Le Chateau to study to become a teacher. There she fell in love with one of the teachers.

==Puberty==
Although Barbin was in puberty, she had not begun to [[menstruation|menstruate]] and remained flat chested. The hairs on her upper lip and cheeks were noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foucault|first1=Michel|title=Herculine Barbin|date=1980|publisher=Pantheon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyHcwTtRdkMC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;dq=barbin+alexina+camille&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-WY0k-HXd-&amp;sig=X8ta993lYOEbiqieknjXuVgAT64&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig8-eb1_LRAhUD44MKHUCDBjsQ6AEIcDAU#v=onepage&amp;q=barbin%20alexina%20camille&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857 Barbin received a position as an assistant teacher in a girls' school. She fell in love with another teacher, Sara, and Barbin demanded that only she should dress her. Her ministrations turned into caresses and they became lovers. Eventually rumors about their affair began to circulate.

Barbin, although sick her whole life, began to suffer excruciating pains. When a doctor examined her, he was shocked and asked that she should be sent away from the school, but she stayed.

Eventually, the devoutly Catholic Barbin confessed to [[Jean-François-Anne Landriot]], the [[Bishop of La Rochelle]]. She asked him permission to break the confessional silence in order to send for a doctor to examine her. When Dr. Chesnet did so in 1860, he discovered that even if Barbin had a small [[vagina]], she had a masculine body type, a very small penis, and testicles inside her body. In 20th-century medical terms, she had "[[male pseudohermaphroditism]]".

==Reassignment as male==
A later legal decision declared official that Barbin was male. She left her lover and her job, changed her name to '''Abel Barbin''' and was briefly mentioned in the press. She moved to Paris where she lived in poverty and wrote her memoirs, reputedly as a part of therapy. In the memoirs, Barbin would use female pronouns when writing about her life prior to sexual redesignation and male pronouns, including Alexina and Camille, following the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foucault|first1=Michel|title=Herculine Barbin|date=1980|publisher=Pantheon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyHcwTtRdkMC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;dq=barbin+alexina+camille&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-WY0k-HXd-&amp;sig=X8ta993lYOEbiqieknjXuVgAT64&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig8-eb1_LRAhUD44MKHUCDBjsQ6AEIcDAU#v=onepage&amp;q=barbin%20alexina%20camille&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, she clearly regarded herself as punished, and "disinherited", subject to a "ridiculous inquisition".

In his commentary to Barbin's memoirs, [[Michel Foucault]] presented Barbin as an example of the "happy limbo of a non-identity", but whose masculinity marked her from her contemporaries.&lt;ref name="holmes2004"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1444-3775| issue = 8| last = Holmes| first = Morgan| authorlink=Morgan Holmes | title = Locating Third Sexes| journal = Transformations Journal| series = Regions of Sexuality| date = July 2004
| url = http://www.transformationsjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Holmes_Transformations08.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morgan Holmes]] states that Barbin's own writings showed that she saw herself as an "exceptional female", but female nonetheless.&lt;ref name="holmes2004" /&gt;

==Death==
In February 1868, the [[concierge]] of Barbin's house in rue de l'École-de-Médecine found her dead in her home. She had committed suicide by inhaling gas from her [[producer gas|coal gas]] [[gas stove|stove]]. Her memoirs were found beside her bed.

==Memoirs publication==
[[Image:Tardieu1872.jpg|thumb|right|255px|Title page of Ambroise Tardieu's 1872 book in which excerpts of Herculine Barbin's memoirs were first published.]]
Dr. Regnier reported the death, recovered the memoirs and performed an autopsy. Later he gave the memoirs to [[Auguste Ambroise Tardieu]], who published excerpts as "Histoire et souvenirs d'Alexina B." ("The Story and Memoirs of Alexina B.") in his book ''Question médico-légale de l'identité dans ses rapport avec les vices de conformation des organes sexuels, contenant les souvenirs et impressions d'un individu dont le sexe avait été méconnu'' ("Forensics of Identity Involving Deformities of the Sexual Organs, Along With the Memoirs and Impressions of an Individual Whose Sex Was Misidentified") (Paris: J.-B. Ballière et Fils, 1872). The excerpts were translated to English in 1980.

[[Michel Foucault]] discovered the memoirs in the 1970s while conducting research at the French Department of Public Hygiene. He had the journals republished as ''[[Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth-century French Hermaphrodite]]''. In his edition, Foucault also included a set of medical reports, legal documents, and newspaper articles, as well as a short story adaptation by Oscar Panizza.

==Modern commentaries and references==
According to [[Morgan Holmes]], the anthropologist Gilbert Herdt has identified Barbin as providing a crisis for "modern ideology" through an identification as neither male nor female,&lt;ref name="herdt1994"&gt;{{cite book | first = Gilbert | last = Herdt | title = Third Sex, Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History | location = New York | publisher = Zone | date = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Barbin's own writings describe a self-identification as female, albeit an exceptional female.&lt;ref name="holmes2004" /&gt;

Barbin's memoirs inspired the French film ''[[The Mystery of Alexina]]''. and [[Jeffrey Eugenides]] in his book ''[[Middlesex (novel)|Middlesex]]'' treats concurrent themes, as does [[Virginia Woolf]] in her book, ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]''. [[Judith Butler]] refers to Foucault's commentary on Barbin at various points in her 1990 ''[[Gender Trouble]]'', including her chapter "Foucault, Herculine, and the Politics of Sexual Discontinuity."

Barbin appears as a character in the play ''[[A Mouthful of Birds]]'' by [[Caryl Churchill]] and [[David Lan]]. Barbin also appears as a character in the play ''Hidden: A Gender'' by [[Kate Bornstein]]. ''Herculine,'' a full-length play based on the memoirs of Barbin, is by Garrett Heater. Kira Obolensky also wrote a two-act stage adaptation entitled ''The Adventures of Herculina''.

In 2014, a  manuscript entitled ''Dear Herculine'' by Aaron Apps won the 2014 Sawtooth Poetry Prize from Ahsahta Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Apps |first=Aaron |date=2015 |title=Intersex: A Memoir |publisher=[[Tarpaulin Sky Press]] |isbn=978-1-939460-04-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
The birthday of Herculine Barbin is marked in [[Intersex Day of Remembrance]] on 8 November.

'''Jean-François Nicolas Boch Buschmann''' (9 March 1782 - 9 February 1858) was a [[Luxembourg]] manufacturer.   He was a member of the third generation of owners of the family pottery business, [[Villeroy &amp; Boch|Jean-François Boch]] which at that time had its headquarters at [[:de:Siebenbrunnen (Luxemburg)|Siebenbrunnen]] a short distance to the north of [[Luxembourg City]].   He became the head of the family firm which, in his time, was known chiefly for industrial production of porcelain tableware and tiles.&lt;ref name=JFBlautADB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Boch-Buschmann,_Johann_Franz|title=Boch: Johann Franz Nicolaus B.-Buschmann, geb. zu Siebenbrunnen (Sept-Fontaines) bei ...|author=Johann Schötter|work=[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]|publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot, Leipzig &amp; Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, München| volume=2| date=1875| pages=760–761| accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JFBlautSB&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.saarland-biografien.de/Boch-Jean-Francois| title=Boch Jean François |work=Note that although this source gives his place of death as [[Mettlach]], a number of other sources indicate that he died at [[:de:Siebenbrunnen (Luxemburg)|Siebenbrunnen (Luxemburg) / Sept-fontaines (Luxembourg)]] |publisher=Dr. Joachim Conrad i.A, Saarländische Biografien| accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting the variety of languages in common use in Luxembourg, sources may identify him under various different names.   Older German language sources may refer to him as Johann Franz Boch or Johann Franz Boch-Buschmann.   Luxembourgeois and Dutch language sources may identify him as Jean Boch-Buschmann.

==Life==

===Family provenance and connections===
Jean-François Boch was born in the family home at  [[:de:Siebenbrunnen (Luxemburg)|Siebenbrunnen / Sept-Fontaines]] in [[Luxembourg]].   His father was the entrepreneur-industrialist [[:de:Pierre-Joseph Boch|Pierre-Joseph Boch]] (1737-1818) from [[Lorraine]].   His mother, born Marie Antoinette Lucie Nothomb, was from Luxembourg.&lt;ref name=JFBlautWL&gt;{{cite web|pages=339–340|title=Boch, säarland. Industriellenfamilie ... 2) Johann Franz Nikolaus B.-Buschmann|author=Walter Lauer, Saarbrücken|url=http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0001/bsb00016318/images/index.html?id=00016318&amp;groesser=&amp;fip=qrsxdsydxseayawyztsewq&amp;no=6&amp;seite=358|work=Neue deutsche Biographie| volume=2| publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot, , Berlin &amp; Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, München|date=31 December 1953|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806 Boch married Anne Marie Rosalie Buschmann (1785-1870), the daughter of a successful [[Tanning (leather)|master-tanner]] from [[St. Vith]].&lt;ref name=JFBlautSB/&gt;

===Mettlach===
Boch learned the business of industrial pottery from his father.   When he was 27 he left his parents' home to set up in business independently, buying in 1809 the [[baroque]] [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[:de:Abtei Mettlach|St. Peter's Abbey]] at [[Mettlach]] in the [[Sarre (department)|Sarre]] [[Departments of France|department]].   The abbey was available after having been "secularised" in the wake of the [[French First Republic|French]] [[Left Bank of the Rhine|annexation]] of the region in 1798.   Boch set up an ultra modern and highly mechanised ceramics / tableware factory at Mettlach.&lt;ref name=JFBselonRD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histoire-entreprises.fr/he-le-magazine/villeroy-boch-une-entreprise-franco-allemande/|author=Rainer Desens|date=11 September 2013|title=Villeroy &amp; Boch, une entreprise franco-allemande ?|publisher=Histoire d’entreprises, Lyon|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The machines were operated using hydro-power from a fast flowing stream running into the [[Saar (river)|Sarre]] on one side of the site.&lt;ref name=JFBselonRD/&gt;   For the ovens used for firing the product, the government imposed the condition that Boch would have to use the [[Bituminous coal|soft bituminous coal]] which was available in abundance locally.   This was of technical significance because up to that time no pottery factory in Europe had used this soft coal for its firing ovens.   The ovens created at Mettlach were accordingly the first of their kind.&lt;ref name=JFBlautADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=JFBlautSB/&gt;

Boch's treatment of his workforce reflected the paternalistic approach of the more enlightened employers of the time, and in 1819 he was able to set up an orphans' support fund for workers' families.   A savings and loans bank followed.  He set up a "Workers' casino" and a "Reading association" in order to promote the spiritual and moral improvement of his employees.&lt;ref name=JFBlautADB/&gt;

Business flourished.   At the Prussian Exhibition held in 1822 in Berlin Boch was the only manufacturer in the pottery and ceramics sector to receive a gold medal.   It was also at this exhibition that Boch met the privy councillor and industrial pioneer [[Christian Peter Wilhelm Beuth|Peter Beuth]].   Shortly after this the two of them undertook a research visit to England in order to study production methods there.   Boch spotted a new mechanism for using hydropower to turn [[Potter's wheel|wheels/lathes]] and introduced similar mechanisms in his own factories, which was another first in Continental Europe.&lt;ref name=JFBlautADB/&gt; 

In order to survive the onslaught from English imports, in 1836 Jean-François Boch of Mettlach and his competitor {{Interlanguage link multi|Nicolas Villeroy|fr}} of [[Wallerfangen]] ([[Saarlouis]]) merged their businesses, forming [[Villeroy &amp; Boch]].   Further expansion followed with the acquisition across the frontier in France of "Utzschneider und Fabry" of [[Sarreguemines]] and in Belgium where they established "Keramis".   A facility was also set up at [[Dresden]] in [[Saxony]].&lt;ref name=JFBlautADB/&gt; 

===Siebenbrunnen / Sept-Fontaines===
After he had been able to pass on leadership of the business in Mettlach to his sons, in 1844 Jean-François Boch moved back to [[:de:Siebenbrunnen (Luxemburg)|Siebenbrunnen / Sept-Fontaines]] and took over the original family business there.   He continued to run the company till his death in 1858.   It was here that he developed and put into production a completely new product line, the so-called "Mettlacher Platten" (ceramic floor tiles).&lt;ref name=JFBlautADB/&gt; 

===Politics===
In 1849 Jean-François Boch made a brief excursion into the world of politics, serving as a member of the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] between 3 January and 30 May.   He was one of three representatives from [[Luxembourg]], taking the place previously occupied by [[Jean-Jacques Willmar]], who had to return to Luxembourg after being appointed the [[List of Prime Ministers of Luxembourg|Grand duchy's prime minister]] on 6 December 1848.&lt;ref name=JFBlautADB/&gt;   At  [[Frankfurt Parliament|Frankfurt]] Boch did not join any particular faction, but he tended to vote with the Centre-Right members, supporting of the election of [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|the Prussian king]] as Emperor of the Germans.    (The king declined the appointment.)   When the parliament discussed the question of a possible German state under Prussian leadership, the three Luxembourg members presented a united front, insisting on certain conditions that would be necessary for Luxembourg to join any such union.&lt;ref name=JFBlautADB/&gt;
&lt;!---
Wie auch die beiden anderen luxemburger Abgeordneten sprach er sich unter gewissen Bedingungen für einen Anschluss an ein deutsches Reich unter preußischer Führung aus.

'''Killer Moth''' ('''Drury Walker''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an adversary of [[Batman]]. Killer Moth originally wore a garish costume of purple and green striped fabric, with an orange cape and a moth-like mask.&lt;ref name="dc-ency1"/&gt;

==Publication history==
[[File:Batman063.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Killer Moth's debut]]
Killer Moth first appeared in ''Batman'' #63 (February 1951) and was created by [[Bill Finger]], [[Dick Sprang]], and [[Lew Schwartz]].

==Fictional character biographies==
==="Cameron van Cleer"===
The original Killer Moth was a prisoner identified only by his prison number, 234026. While in prison, he reads a newspaper article about [[Batman]] and decides to set himself up as the "anti-Batman", hiring himself out to [[Gotham City]]'s criminals to help them elude capture by police. Upon his release, he uses the hidden proceeds of his crimes to build a "Mothcave", modeled on the photos of the [[Batcave]] in the newspaper article he read.

Killer Moth also establishes a false identity as millionaire [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] '''Cameron van Cleer'''. In this guise, he becomes friends with Bruce Wayne. Meanwhile, he promotes himself to Gotham's criminals using his identity as Killer Moth, giving them each an [[infra-red]] Moth-Signal. In his first job, he rescues some criminals from the police and then uses his Mothmobile to defeat and capture Batman and [[Robin (character)|Robin]]. The duo escape and lead Killer Moth to a climactic battle on Gotham Bridge, in which he is defeated.

In his second appearance (''Detective Comics'' #173 (July 1951)) Killer Moth kidnaps Bruce Wayne and learns his [[secret identity]]. However, he is shot by other criminals and the resultant cranial injury causes [[amnesia]]. He remains a persistent enemy through the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], being the first villain [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] encounters in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359 (January 1967). He teams up with the [[Cavalier (comics)#Mortimer Drake|Cavalier]] twice: the first time in ''[[Batman Family]]'' #10 (March-April 1977), where they battle Batgirl and [[Batwoman#Publication history|Batwoman]] (Kathy Kane, who comes out of retirement for the first time in years) and the second (and final) time in ''Batman Family'' #15 (December 1977-January 1978), where they battle Batgirl and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]].

===Drury Walker===
In the 1990s, in the Post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] continuity, Killer Moth's real identity is revealed as '''Drury Walker''', an unsuccessful criminal who no one takes seriously. He again adopts the false identity of Cameron van Cleer and the persona of Killer Moth to fight Batman. This version first appears in ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' #7-9 (December 1992-February 1993), with a more detailed origin story appearing in ''[[Batgirl: Year One]]'' #1-9 (February-October 2003).

In ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'', Killer Moth sets up a team called "the Misfits", comprising Batman villains such as [[Catman (DC Comics)|Catman]] and [[Calendar Man]], to make another kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne, as well as other prominent citizens. This team proves unsuccessful, turning against the Moth when they realize he plans to kill the hostages.

He is one of the villains who sells their [[soul]]s to the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' #1 (November 1995) and in ''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'' #23-24 (December 1995-January 1996), where he asks to become feared instead of always being laughed at. He is metamorphosed into a carnivorous moth-like monster called '''Charaxes'''. As Charaxes, Walker resembles a vaguely humanoid, giant brown moth. He consumes humans and spins [[Silkworm cocoons|cocoon]]s in which to keep his prey.

In a later story, Charaxes begins laying hundreds of eggs, all of which hatch into duplicates of Drury Walker. Charaxes despises his progeny, but is unable to destroy them. Following his capture, these duplicates are taken into government custody. During an argument between various bodies as to what should be done with them, they attack a scientist and are killed.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin'' (vol. 2) #107-110 (Dec. 2002-March 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

At around the same time, [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] is confronted by a criminal named '''Danko Twag''' who claims to be the "real" Killer Moth (the one she had defeated), and that Drury Walker had been an impostor. During a rant in which he claims they are going to be a team, she captures him in an energy cell and he seemingly disintegrates himself.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #50-52 (Feb-April 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Charaxes is killed by being ripped in half by [[Superboy-Prime]] during the [[Battle of Metropolis]].&lt;ref name="dc-ency1"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Charaxes | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 77 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to ensure the existence of [[Batman]], [[Rip Hunter]] tells [[Booster Gold]] and [[Skeets (DC Comics)|Skeets]] that they have to make sure Wiley Dalbert, a time-travelling criminal who had hired Killer Moth, completes his crime successfully. Booster does this by dressing up as Killer Moth and taking his place. During the robbery, he is forced to fight with Batman and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] and takes them both down. An unfortunate, unintended side effect of this is that, when they return to the present, Gotham still has no Batman and Killer Moth is now a serious threat, thanks to the "[[street cred]]" from the robbery.&lt;ref&gt;''Booster Gold'' (vol. 2) #11 (October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Booster, Skeets and his sister [[Michelle Carter (comics)|Goldstar]] attempt to fix the anomaly they created by taking Batman's place in the robbery, but things go wrong when [[Alfred Pennyworth]] intervenes; the Time Masters barely escape in the [[Batmobile]]. Instead they steal [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl's]] costume and purchase an [[Elvis]] costume for Booster. Booster stops the version of him dressed as Killer Moth from defeating Batman and makes sure that Wiley gets away with the loot, thus restoring the timeline.&lt;ref&gt;''Booster Gold'' (vol. 2) #12 (November 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' series' ''[[Blackest Night]]'' tie-in story, Charaxes is reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #4 (November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Superboy-Prime destroys Charaxes on Earth Prime, using the black ring cycling through the power set, resulting in a burst of coloured energy that destroys Black Lanterns{{clarify|date=December 2013}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #5 (December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Killer Moth is again Drury Walker, a low-level criminal.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #958&lt;/ref&gt; He first appeared in the "[[Zero Year]]" story arc in which he was defeated by both Batman and Green Arrow, teaming up for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Arrow'' Vol. 5 #25&lt;/ref&gt;. Firefly and Killer Moth team up to hunt and kill Batman in ''All-Star Batman'' after [[Two-Face]] offers millions of dollars to anyone who will kill Batman for him. Like most of the people who try, Firefly and Killer Moth also fail.

Killer Moth later appeared as a member of [[Richard Dragon]]'s [[Longbow Hunters]].&lt;ref&gt;''Green Arrow'' Vol. 5 #31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unknown===
A new Killer Moth appears in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #652, during the ''[[Batman: Face the Face|Face the Face]]'' storyline wherein he displays competence in hand-to-hand combat and the ability of flight when facing Robin. He later appears working alongside fellow Gotham criminals [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]] and [[Lock-Up (comics)|Lock-Up]] in the ''[[Gotham Underground]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. The identity and origins of this new Killer Moth remain unrevealed.

Several villains clad in Killer Moth costumes appear in ''[[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]'' (vol. 3) #7. At least one of them is killed by [[Deadshot (comics)|Deadshot]].

Killer Moth recently appeared in the first issue of the mini-series ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]''. He was hired by [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]] to kidnap and torture Mike Dante, ex-assistant to Atom ally Professor Hyatt. The two current holders of the Atom identity, [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] and [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]], tracked Killer Moth and his goons down to a hideout in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]] and defeated them all. Ray Palmer then tortured Killer Moth by entering his head via the nasal pathways and growing inside his skull. Killer Moth immediately gave up Prometheus as his employer.

In ''[[Red Robin (comic book)|Red Robin]]'' #9, Red Robin returns to Gotham City where he runs into Killer Moth in his classic costume, holding a man at gunpoint. Red Robin thinks to himself "I think this is Killer Moth. The costume and the man change from time to time, so you can never really tell.". This Killer Moth seems to be scared and on the run, stating "Are you with him? Are you with the Atom? I won't let you torture me, too!".

==Powers and abilities==
In his original incarnation, Killer Moth has no [[superhuman]] abilities; he relies on the vast array of equipment he has developed. Killer Moth’s range of gimmicks includes a Mothmobile, a Moth-Signal, and a steel line, which allows him to swing through the skies as if he were flying. He carries a [[pupa|cocoon]] gun that fires a stream of sticky threads that can totally envelop a victim. The gun can also fire a [[grenade]].

As Charaxes, he has superhuman strength, agility and endurance, an [[exoskeleton]] that gives him some protection from physical and energy attacks, a set of wings that allows him to fly, sharp claws and sharp, prehensile antennae. Charaxes secretes a sticky [[acid]]ic substance that can trap the strongest of men and dissolve their bodies.

In ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', he uses a highly compressed air gun to great effect as a weapon, shown to be powerful enough to stop a bullet in mid-air.

==Other versions==

===''Teen Titans Go!''===
In ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic book series, Killer Moth was the second villain to arrive at the tower for the [[Teen Titans|Titans]]' Party Party and informed them that he only attended to spend more time with Silkie. Throughout the party, he cuddled with the mutant moth larvae until [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] ordered all villains to leave, including Killer Moth. Killer Moth attacked Jump City and told the Titans they were outmatched. He noticed [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], who had been disguised, and asked about his identity. [[Beast Boy]] lied that he was their brand new Killer Robot Titan and asked Killer Moth if he wanted to see how he fared against one. The villain, however, immediately left.

===''Batman: Arkham Knight''===
In ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'''s prequel comic, after the events of ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', following the defeat of [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], Drury Walker checked out books from [[Barbara Gordon]] at the local library about moths and staked out her and her father, the newly promoted [[Commissioner Gordon]], which Barbara noticed. Later, at a GCPD panel that proved Batman was simply a man with gadgets instead of some 'paranormal entity', Killer Moth crashed it to advertise his services with a free trial of killing Commissioner Gordon while his henchmen kept Batman preoccupied on the other side of Gotham. Barbara quickly put on the sample Batman costume, managed to defeat Killer Moth's henchmen, and disarmed the villain. After he realized that his plans were falling apart, Killer Moth threw Gordon off the rafters to kill him and used that as a diversion for his escape. As Barbara saved her father, Drury made his escape, and tried to calm himself down by saying that Batgirl was just a girl in a suit, like Batman, who happened to arrive just in time and subdued him.

===''Injustice 2''===
Killer Moth appears in the prequel comic to ''[[Injustice 2]]''. Following the events of the first game, Killer Moth is shown to be a member of this universe's [[Suicide Squad]],&lt;ref&gt;''Injustice 2'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; but after an impostor Batman (later revealed to be [[Jason Todd]]) surprisingly appears and takes control of the Squad, he kills Killer Moth using the bomb implanted in his neck, considering him to be useless.&lt;ref&gt;''Injustice 2'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
* A short episode of the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s live-action ''Batman'' television series]] that premiered [[Batgirl]] featured Killer Moth as the villain (played by [[Tim Herbert]]), but it was never aired. It had been circulated through bootlegs on the [[Internet]] or at conventions, and in 2014 was finally released as a bonus inclusion (''Bat Rarities! Straight from the Vault'') in the official complete DVD/Blu-ray sets.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: The Complete Television Series'', Warner Bros., 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the character's simultaneous comic book introduction (''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359, January 1967), "The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl", Killer Moth is Batgirl's first and main adversary after he leads her to believe that he killed Bruce Wayne. Batgirl later learns that Wayne has not died after confronting Batman and Robin.

* When asked about Killer Moth's inclusion in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' producer Bruce Timm expressed little interest and joked that he had cast Canadian actor [[Dan Aykroyd]] for the role, and have him running around screaming, "I'm a bug!" Producer Alan Burnett, on the other hand, stated, "we just haven't thought of a good story for him yet." Ultimately, Killer Moth never appeared in the series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/unused/batman/killermoth.php&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TT killer moth.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Killer Moth as depicted on ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]''.]]
* Killer Moth appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'', voiced by [[Thomas Haden Church]] and later voiced by [[Marc Worden]]. In the episode "Date with Destiny", he is introduced as a criminal who has been bio-engineering mutant moth creatures with the intention of using them to take over the city. At the prodding of his spoiled daughter Kitten (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]), whose boyfriend Fang (voiced by [[Will Friedle]]) recently broke up with her, Killer Moth uses the invading creatures to [[blackmail]] [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] into taking Kitten to her junior prom. His plan is foiled when Robin breaks the device which controls his moths (which was in Kitten's possession) and Killer Moth, Fang and Kitten are taken to jail. Killer Moth returns in the episode "Can I Keep Him?", where he turns [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire's]] pet larva named Silkie (a.k.a. Larva M-319) into a giant moth to attack the Titans. He is eventually taken down by his own creation when Silkie decides that he prefers Starfire over Killer Moth after exploding back into a larva. Killer Moth and Kitten later become members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. The two join in the final battle against the Titans in "Calling All Titans" wherein Kitten fights with a laser-whip, while Killer Moth attacks Starfire with a large swarm of moths. Since the battle ends off-screen in "Titans Together", and since Starfire later reappears inside the Brain's base to rescue Beast Boy's group along with Bumblebee and Red Star, it is assumed that either Starfire won the fight off-screen or at least was able to escape capture. Killer Moth is literally put on ice (with the other Brotherhood members) when [[Más y Menos]] send him through Professor Chang's flash-freezing machine.

[[File:KillerMoth.jpg|thumb|right|Killer Moth as seen in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.]]
* Killer Moth appears in the series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]. Because of his costume's colors, it is easy to assume that this is the Drury Walker version. The character is a physically weak coffee boy for the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]'s gang in the episode "Team Penguin". He is later transformed into a massive, powerful version of Charaxes after being exposed to chemical fumes and [[radioactive]] moths dissolving into his skin during a robbery with Penguin. Killer Moth still maintains his milquetoast personality and poor combat abilities despite his size and strength. Seeing that his new form entitles him to some respect, Killer Moth intimidates Rag Doll, Firefly and Killer Croc into obeying Penguin; Moth held great respect for Penguin, hence his actions, not aware that Penguin was also initially afraid of him. Killer Moth's Charaxes form is later seen very briefly in the episode "Rumors" being captured by the vigilante Rumor and is later defeated by Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] along with every other villain.

* Killer Moth is featured in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Corey Burton]]. In this version, he wears his classic purple and orange costume probably indicating that the Killer Moth featured is Drury Walker (who once used the alias of Cameron von Cleer in the Pre-Crisis comics). In "Legends of the Dark Mite", Killer Moth is among the Batman villains in Bat-Mite's fantasy. He is taken down by the real Batman. In "A Bat Divided", Killer Moth is seen in a bar where the other villains hang out. In "Gorillas in Our Midst", he robs an armored truck alongside his henchmen. Killer Moth is defeated by [[B'wana Beast]] and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]]. In the teaser for "The Last Patrol", he kidnaps Batman and almost feeds him to the Atlas Moth in his lair. Killer Moth, his henchmen, and his beast are defeated when Batgirl comes into view and rescues Batman.

* Killer Moth appears in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' episode "Missing", voiced by [[Scott Menville]]. Killer Moth was shown to have a base underneath the Jump City Bridge. Robin, Cyborg, and Beast Boy find a missing poster made by Killer Moth for the return of Silkie. This causes Robin, Cyborg, and Beast Boy to secretly snatch Silkie while Starfire was sleeping and returned her to Killer Moth. Killer Moth then gives Robin, Cyborg, and Beast Boy the reward money. Starfire learns that Killer Moth has Silkie and is devastated. Raven takes Starfire to Killer Moth's base to see if Silkie is happy with Killer Moth. As Killer Moth prepares to mutate Silkie, Starfire and Raven spring into action as Killer Moth throws Silkie into the chemicals. Killer Moth tries to get Silkie to attack them which does not go well. Killer Moth gives up on his evil plot and retires to bed. He has made some non-speaking cameos in later episodes.

* Killer Moth appears in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'', voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]].

===Film===
* In ''[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]'', a box containing Killer Moth's equipment is seen.

* Killer Moth appears in ''[[Batman: Bad Blood]]'', voiced by [[Jason Spisak]]. He appears as one of [[Talia al Ghul]]'s henchmen and frequently teams up with [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]] to attack enemies from above. He is presumably killed when he is crushed by a falling boulder while in an aerial battle with [[Batwing (DC Comics)|Batwing]].

* Killer Moth appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''.

====Lego====
[[File:Lego killer moth.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Killer Moth in ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]''.]]
* Killer Moth (identified as Drury Walker) appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'' with his sound effects provided by [[Steven Blum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery", ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.&lt;/ref&gt; He aids [[Joker (comics)|Joker's]] plot in poisoning Gotham City with his laughing gas. Like his namesake, in game Killer Moth is attracted to bright lights, even repeatedly trying to touch a lamp while at the Joker's hideout with the others, but [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|the Scarecrow]] stops him (by slapping him in the back of the head). He uses a handgun as a weapon. He also has the ability to glide using his wings. In the [[Nintendo DS]] version, Killer Moth is an unlockable character. His original form is unlocked through the "Villain Hunt" minigame while his Alternate form (the one based from the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' TV series) can be bought as you progress the game.

* Killer Moth appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', voiced by Joseph Balderrama. He appears as both an optional boss and a playable character. He is sarcastically declared by [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] to be "not a joke". He can be found near the Gotham Power Plant.

* Killer Moth appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Troy Baker]].{{CN|date=September 2018}}

====Arkham====
* Killer Moth is referenced in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' where his victim's skeleton can be seen hanging from a giant cocoon in the botanical gardens. Scanning one of the skeletons in detective mode as the answer to one of Riddler's riddles unlocks his biography, revealing his name is Drury Walker, he is human, and that he has used Cameron von Cleer as an alias in his crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2009/03/04/batman-arkham-asylum-is-a-batman-game-worth-getting-excited-about/ |title=‘Batman Arkham Asylum’ - A Batman Game Worth Getting Excited About » MTV Multiplayer |publisher=Multiplayerblog.mtv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309154247/http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2009/03/04/batman-arkham-asylum-is-a-batman-game-worth-getting-excited-about/ |archivedate=2012-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Killer Moth is referenced in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', he is mentioned by one thug of Black Mask in the [[Red Hood]] DLC, when he is heard saying, "Is this Red Hood the same guy who took out Killer Moth last month?", not only confirming the character's death, but that Red Hood is the one who finished the deed. However, it is possible that Killer Moth somehow managed to survive the encounter. He is also mentioned in the main game itself where he is mentioned by a cop who thinks that the cops should stop going after Penguin and investigate Killer Moth instead.

===Toys===
* An action figure of Killer Moth (as Charaxes) was released in 2006 Mattel's The Batman Shadowtek line.

The third is to be released in 2018 as part of the second Collectible Minifigure blind-bag series based on The LEGO Batman Movie.

===Miscellaneous===
* In ''[[The Batman Strikes!]]'' (a comic series based on "The Batman" TV series), Killer Moth (still in his Charaxes form) teams up with two more crooks to rob a bank, but is easily foiled by Robin who was busy in a school day since Batman was also fighting Poison Ivy at the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1491">'''Kim Andersen''' (born 1963 in [[Klampenborg]], Denmark) is a [[jockey]] in Scandinavian [[horse racing]].

Andersen grew up at the [[race track|racecourse]] in [[Klampenborg]] where his father, [[John Andersen]], was a [[jockey]] in the 1960s. He was keen to follow in his father's footsteps after finishing his [[education]]. His apprenticeship was postponed for 3 years because his father retired due to ill health after being in the business over in 20 years. His parents thought it was best if he first got an education.

After finishing school Kim Andersen trained as a [[confectioner]] before he first became an apprentice to the champion trainer [[Franz Nutz]]. At the time [[Franz Nutz|Nutz]] already had a number of apprentice jockeys in his care who helped teach Andersen the business.

The first year as an apprentice there were no victories, but he persevered and won his first race a year later. He went on to become the leading jockey at his home racecourse at Klampenborg for 11 years.

Andersen has ridden with success at a number of racing venues throughout Europe and made two visits to [[Western Australia]] where he also met with success.

'''Kim Hyong-gwon''' ({{korean|hangul = 김형권}}; 4 November 1905 – 12 January 1936) was a Korean revolutionary. He is known for attacking a Japanese police station in [[Japanese-occupied Korea]] and subsequently dying in Seoul's [[Seodaemun Prison]] where he was serving his sentence.

Kim Hyong-gwon was an uncle of the founding [[North Korean leader]], [[Kim Il-sung]].{{sfn|An Indomitable Revolutionary Fighter&amp;nbsp;— Comrade Kim Hyong Gwon|1976|p=[5]}} As such, he is among the most celebrated of the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]] members in [[North Korean propaganda]]. [[Kimhyonggwon County]] in [[North Korea]] is named after him.

==Personal life==
[[File:Seodaemunprisonbarracks.jpg|thumb|alt=The barracks of Seodaemun Prison during winter.|Seodaemun Prison, where Kim Hyong-gwon died, was used for keeping anti-colonial activists in custody.]]

Kim was a revolutionary fighter and an active communist in the 1930s. His personality has been described as "hot-tempered".&lt;ref name="Martin2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bradley K.

Kim Hyong-gwon is among the most important Kim family members in propaganda, and comparable in that context to other prominent family members like Kim Il-sung's father [[Kim Hyong-jik]], or great grandfather Kim Ung-u, who is claimed to have been involved in the [[General Sherman incident]].&lt;ref name="Lim2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jae-Cheon Lim|title=Leader Symbols and Personality Cult in North Korea: The Leader State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcwqBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT68|date=24 March 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-56740-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whyte2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallcrowdedworld.com/2014/03/21/anti-americanism-in-korea-why-one-of-our-closest-allies-has-mixed-feelings/ |title=Anti-Americanism in South Korea: Why one of our closest allies has mixed feelings |last=Whyte |first=Leon |date=21 March 2014 |website=smallcrowdedworld.com |publisher= |access-date=11 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713232825/http://smallcrowdedworld.com/2014/03/21/anti-americanism-in-korea-why-one-of-our-closest-allies-has-mixed-feelings/ |archivedate=13 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korean propaganda insists that most family members were in some way participating in the foundation of the North Korean state and among them Kim Hyong-gwon is portrayed as having been sacrificed for [[anti-Japanese struggle]] and the revolution.&lt;ref name="Lim2015"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4142">'''Lawrence Clinton Washington''' (born 1951, [[Vermont]]) is an American mathematician at the University of Maryland, who specializes in number theory.

==Biography==
Washington studied at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where in 1971 he received his B.A. and master's degree. In 1974 he earned his PhD at [[Princeton University]] under [[Kenkichi Iwasawa]] with thesis ''Class numbers and &lt;math&gt;Z_p&lt;/math&gt; extensions''.&lt;ref&gt;''Class numbers and &lt;math&gt;Z_p&lt;/math&gt; extensions'', Mathematische Annalen, vol. 214, 1975, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; He then became an assistant professor at [[Stanford University]] and from 1977 at the [[University of Maryland]], where he became in 1981 an associate professor and in 1986 a professor. He held visiting positions at several institutions, including [[IHES]] (1980/81), [[Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik]] (1984), the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (1996), and [[MSRI]] (1986/87), as well as at the [[University of Perugia]], [[Nankai University]] and the [[State University of Campinas]].

Washington wrote a standard work on [[cyclotomic field]]s. He also worked on [[p-adic]] [[L-function]]s. He wrote a treatise with Allan Adler on their discovery of a connection between higher-dimensional analogues of [[magic square]]s and p-adic L-functions.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Washington ''P-adic L functions and higher dimensional magic cubes'', Journal of Number Theory, vol. 52, 1995, p.179. See also Adler, Mathematical Intelligencer. 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Washington has done important work on [[Iwasawa theory]], [[Henri Cohen (number theorist)|Cohen]]-[[Hendrik Lenstra|Lenstra]] heuristics, and [[elliptic curve]]s and their applications to [[cryptography]].

In Iwasawa theory he proved with Bruce Ferrero in 1979 a conjecture of [[Kenkichi Iwasawa]], that the &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;-invariant vanishes for cyclotomic '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;-extensions of [[abelian number field]]s ([[Ferrero–Washington theorem|Theorem of Ferrero-Washington]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ferrero, Washington ''The Iwasawa invariant μ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; vanishes for abelian number fields'', Annals of Mathematics, vol. 109, 1979, pp. 377–395. Another proof was provided by W. Sinnott, Inventiones Mathematicae, vol. 75, 1984, 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Washington has published on arithmetic dynamics, sums of powers of primes, and Iwasawa invariants of non-cyclotomic '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; extensions as well as continued service to the mathematical community, including outreach at [[Montgomery Blair]], a local high school. 

In 1979–1981 he was a [[Sloan Fellowship|Sloan Fellow]].

This is a partial '''list of people''' who have been categorized as '''[[Deism|Deists]]''', the belief in a deity based on [[Natural theology|natural religion]] only, or belief in religious truths discovered by people through a process of reasoning, independent of any [[revelation]] through [[scripture]]s or [[prophet]]s. They have been selected for their influence on Deism, or for their fame in other areas.
&lt;!--Please add brief descriptions and citations to all the entries in this list, since "deism" is broad enough to require elaboration to be a meaningful term.--&gt;
* [[Abraham Lincoln]] (1809–1865), sixteenth president of the United States of America. He never joined any church and has been described as a "Christian deist". As a young man, he was religiously skeptical and sometimes ridiculed revivalists. During his early years, Lincoln enjoyed reading the works of deists such as [[Thomas Paine]] and [[Voltaire]]. He drafted a pamphlet incorporating such ideas but did not publish it. After charges of hostility to Christianity almost cost him a congressional bid, he kept his unorthodox beliefs private. [[James Adams (lawyer)|James Adams]] labelled Lincoln as a deist. In 1834, he reportedly wrote a manuscript essay challenging Christianity modelled on Paine's book ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', which a friend supposedly burned to protect him from ridicule. He seemed to believe in an all-powerful God, who shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* [[Alfred M. Mayer]] (1836–1897), American physicist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Physics in Transition: A History of Conceptual Change in the Late Nineteenth Century|year=1983|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780938228066|author=Albert E. Moyer|page=40|quote=This deistic leaning persisted in Mayer's thought.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Al-Maʿarri]] (973–1058), was a blind Arab philosopher, poet and writer, and a controversial rationalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html Freethought Traditions in the Islamic World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214102422/http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html |date=14 February 2012 }} by Fred Whitehead; also quoted in Cyril Glasse, (2001), ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 278. Rowman Altamira.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anaxagoras]] (c. 500–428 BC), Pre-Socratic Greek philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Plato: Republic Book X|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|editor=John Ferguson|accessdate=11 July 2012|page=15|quote=Anaxagoras was a typical Deist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Andrei Sakharov]] (1921–1989), Soviet nuclear physicist, dissident, and human rights activist.&lt;ref&gt;Sakharov believed that a non-scientific "guiding principle" governed the universe and human life. Drell, Sidney D., and Sergei P. Kapitsa (eds.), Sakharov Remembered, pp. 3, 92. New York: Springer, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Antony Flew]] (1923–2010), British [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] and prominent former atheist; during his last years he openly made an allegiance to Deism&lt;ref name="Flew"&gt;{{cite news |last=Grimes |first=William |date=16 April 2010 |title=Antony Flew, Philosopher and Ex-Atheist, Dies at 87 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/17/arts/17flew.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=27 October 2018 |quote=In “There Is a God” he explained that he now believed in a supreme intelligence, removed from human affairs but responsible for the intricate workings of the universe. In other words, the [[Divine Watchmaker]] imagined by [[Deism|deists]] like [[Isaac Newton]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;br&gt; In a letter to The Sunday Telegraph of London in 2004, he described “the God in whose existence I have belatedly come to believe” as “most emphatically not the eternally rewarding and eternally torturing God of either Christianity or Islam but the [[Aristotelian theology|God of Aristotle]] that he would have defined — had Aristotle actually produced a definition of his (and my) God — as the [[Unmoved mover|first initiating and sustaining cause of the universe]].”}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated to have acknowledged the existence of an [[Divine Watchmaker|Intelligent Creator]] of the [[universe]], the [[Unmoved mover|Aristotelian God]].&lt;ref name="Flew"/&gt;

* [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–90), American polymath; one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://earlyamerica.com/lives/franklin/chapt6/ The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin] from earlyamerica.com&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777–1855), German mathematician and physical scientist who contributed significantly to many fields, including [[number theory]], statistics, analysis, [[differential geometry]], [[geodesy]], [[geophysics]], [[electrostatics]], [[astronomy]] and [[optics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gauss: a biographical study|year=1981|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=9780387106625|page=152|author=Walter Kaufmann Bühler|chapter=14|quote=Despite his strong roots in the Enlightenment, Gauss was not an atheist, rather a deist with very unorthodox convictions,...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gauss: A Biographical Study|year=1981|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=9780387106625|page=153|author=Walter Kaufmann Bühler|quote=Judging from the correspondence, Gauss did not believe in a personal god. An essential part of his credo was his confidence in the harmony and integrity of the grand design of the creation. Mathematics was the key to man's efforts to obtain at least a faint idea of God's plan. Obviously, Gauss's beliefs had a strong resemblance to Leibniz's system, though they were much less systematic and explicit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Judaism in Transition: The Secularization of a Religious Community|year=1995|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=9780761800163|author=Gerhard Falk|chapter=The Influence of Scientific Thinking on the Secularization Process|page=121|quote=Gauss told his friend Rudolf Wagner, a professor of biology at Gottingen University, that he did not believe in the Bible but that he had meditated a great deal on the future of the human soul and speculated on the possibility of the soul being reincarnated on another planet. Evidently, Gauss was a Deist with a good deal of skepticism concerning religion but incorporating a great deal of philosophical interests in the Big Questions, that is. the immortality of the soul, the afterlife and the meaning of man's existence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gauss, Carl Friedrich|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss.aspx |publisher=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography |accessdate= 29 July 2012 |year=2008|quote=In seeming contradiction, his religious and philosophical views leaned toward those of his political opponents. He was an uncompromising believer in the priority of empiricism in science. He did not adhere to the views of Kant, Hegel and other idealist philosophers of the day. He was not a churchman and kept his religious views to himself. Moral rectitude and the advancement of scientific knowledge were his avowed principles.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195030853|author=Morris Kline|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Charles Lyell]] (1797–1875), British lawyer and the foremost geologist of his day. He is best known as the author of ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', which popularised [[James Hutton]]'s concepts of [[uniformitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Young Charles Darwin |year=2009 |publisher= Yale University Press|isbn=9780300136081|author=Keith Stewart Thomson |page=109|quote=In his religious views, Lyell was essentially a deist, holding the position that God had originally created the world and life on it, and then had allowed nature to operate according to its own (God-given) natural laws, rather than constantly intervening to direct and shape the course of all history.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914), American philosopher, logician, mathematician, and scientist, sometimes known as "the father of [[pragmatism]]". He was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for 30 years. Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, scientific methodology, and [[semiotics]], and for his founding of pragmatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Charles Sanders Peirce: A Life|year=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253211613|author=Joseph Brent|edition=2|page=18|quote=Peirce had strong, though unorthodox, religious convictions. Although he was a communicant in the Episcopal church for most of his life, he expressed contempt for the theologies, metaphysics, and practices of established religions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Colin Maclaurin]] (1698–1746), Scottish mathematician who made important contributions to geometry and algebra. The Maclaurin series, a special case of the [[Taylor series]], are named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of the Earth's Intiquity|year=2010|publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com|isbn=9781458766625|author=Jack Repcheck|page=58|quote=But Maclaurin had one other major effect on Hutton. Maclaurin was a deist, one who believes in a creator God, a God who designed and built the universe and then set His creation into motion (but does not interfere with the day-to-day workings of the system or the actions of people).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] (1834–1907), Russian chemist and inventor. He is credited as being the creator of the first version of the [[periodic table]] of elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Well-ordered Thing: Dmitrii Mendeleev And The Shadow Of The Periodic Table|year=2004|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780465027750|author=Michael D. Gordin|page=230|quote=Mendeleev's son Ivan later vehemently denied claims that his father was devoutly Orthodox: "I have also heard the view of my father's 'church religiosity' — and I must reject this categorically. From his earliest years Father practically split from the church — and if he tolerated certain simple everyday rites, then only as an innocent national tradition, similar to Easter cakes, which he didn't consider worth fighting against." ...Mendeleev's opposition to traditional Orthodoxy was not due to either atheism or a scientific materialism. Rather, he held to a form of romanticized deism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ethan Allen]] (1738–89), early American revolutionary and guerrilla leader&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Reason: The Only Oracle Of Man |url= http://www.deism.org/ethanallen.htm | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20041210113657/http://www.deism.org/ethanallen.htm| archivedate=10 December 2004 | author=Ethan Allen| year= 1784| accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Elihu Palmer]] (1764–1806), American author and advocate of deism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpcn.org/history/pastors/palmer/ Elihu Palmer – First Presbyterian Church of Newtown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213094003/http://www.fpcn.org/history/pastors/palmer/ |date=13 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706–1749), French mathematician, physicist, and author during the Age of Enlightenment. Her crowning achievement is considered to be her translation and commentary on [[Isaac Newton]]'s work [[Principia Mathematica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in mathematics|year=1974|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262650090|page=69|author=Lynn M. Osen|quote=In addition to these achievements, Mme du Chatelet was also interested in critical deism, particularly where this deism touched on the science of her century. She produced a manuscript based on her critical examination of the Old and New Testaments, and although this manuscript was never published, scholars are now examining it, specifically for its significance to the development of Voltaire's thought.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emilie du Châtelet 1706–1749|url=http://www.enotes.com/emilie-du-chatelet-essays/du-chatelet-emilie|work=Literary Criticism (1400–1800)|publisher=Gale Cengage|accessdate=27 May 2013|year=2004|quote=While her translation of Mandeville was not read during her lifetime, except among her peers, this work was quite familiar to Voltaire, who was strongly influenced by it in writing his own Traité de métaphysique. In keeping with philosophical trends of the day, she began a work on grammar, the unfinished Grammaire raisonné, and she applied her thoughts on deism and metaphysics to a study of the Bible, resulting in the unpublished Examen de la Genèse (which may be translated as "The Examination of Genesis"). Both studies reflect du Châtelet's Enlightenment commitment to applying science and reason to all aspects of human life, including language and religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ernest Rutherford]] (1871–1937), New Zealand [[chemist]] and "father" of [[nuclear physics]], who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1908 "for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Letter to an Atheist|year=2007|publisher=Harpeth River Press |isbn=9780979497407 |author= Michael Patrick Leahy|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ernest Rutherford|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195123784|page=13|author=J. L. Heilbron|chapter=1: Cambridge and Ray Physics|quote=He emerged a clever teenager, cheerful and strong, with a good earthy sense of humor, no airs, a wide set of manual skills, no obvious genius, an indifference to religion, and, despite having many sisters, a remarkable shyness with girls.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226068596|author=Peter J. Bowler|page=61|quote=Ernest Rutherford seems to have abandoned his Presbyterian up- bringing completely, apart from its moral code. A colleague wrote of him: "I knew Rutherford rather well and under varied conditions from 1903 onwards, but never heard religion discussed; nor have I found in his papers one line of writing connected with it." ...Given the reports quoted above, it is difficult to believe that either Rutherford or Ford was deeply religious in private.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759–1805), German poet, philosopher, historian, and playwright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Doubt, Atheism, and the Nineteenth-Century Russian Intelligentsia |year=2011|publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres|isbn=9780299284442|author=Victoria Frede |page=57|quote=Schiller was no atheist: he preached faith in God and respect for the Bible, but he condemned Christianity (both Catholic and Protestant forms) as a religion of hypocrisy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716), German mathematician and philosopher. He is best known for developing [[infinitesimal calculus]] independently of [[Isaac Newton]], and his mathematical notation has been widely used ever since it was published. He has also been labeled a [[Christian]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;"In a commentary on Shaftesbury published in 1720, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a Rationalist philosopher and mathematician, accepted the Deist conception of God as an intelligent Creator but refused the contention that a god who metes out punishments is evil." Andreas Sofroniou, ''Moral Philosophy, from Hippocrates to the 21st Aeon'', page 197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Consistent with the liberal views of the Enlightenment, Leibniz was an optimist with respect to human reasoning and scientific progress (Popper 1963, p.69). Although he was a great reader and admirer of Spinoza, Leibniz, being a confirmed deist, rejected emphatically Spinoza's pantheism: God and nature, for Leibniz, were not simply two different "labels" for the same "thing". Shelby D. Hunt, ''Controversy in marketing theory: for reason, realism, truth, and objectivity'' (2003), page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (1729–1781), German writer, philosopher, dramatist, publicist, and art critic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/le/LessingG.html|title=Bartleby.com: Great Books Online -- Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Washington]] (1732–1799), one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] and the 1st President of the United States&lt;ref name=vqr/&gt;
* [[Harish-Chandra]] (1923–1983), Indian mathematician, who did fundamental work in [[representation theory]], especially [[Harmonic analysis]] on [[semisimple Lie group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mathematical Legacy of Harish-Chandra: A Celebration of Representation Theory and Harmonic Analysis : An AMS Special Session Honoring the Memory of Harish-Chandra, January 9–10, 1998, Baltimore, Maryland|year=2000|publisher=American Mathematical Soc. |isbn=9780821811979 |pages=40–41 |author=Armand Borel|quote=The sense of purpose Harish gave to his life had some spiritual, even religious underpinning. His religion was not a traditional one with the usual paraphernalia of stories, rituals, prayers and direct intervention of a personal god.

'''Louisa Cranstoun Nisbett''' (1812 – 15 January 1858), English actress, was the daughter of Frederick Hayes Macnamara, an actor, whose stage name was Mordaunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Nisbett, Louisa Cranstoun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As '''Miss Mordaunt''' she had considerable experience, especially in Shakespearean leading parts, before her first London appearance in 1829 at [[Drury Lane]] as Widow Cheerly in [[Andrew Cherry]]'s ''[[The Soldier's Daughter]]''. Her beauty and high spirits made her at once a popular favourite in a large number of comedy parts, until in 1831 she was married to Captain John Alexander Nisbett and retired. Her husband, however, was killed the same year by a fall from his horse, and she was compelled to reappear on the stage in 1832. She was the original Lady Gay Spanker of ''[[London Assurance]]'' (1841).

In 1844 she withdrew again from the stage to marry [[Boothby baronets#Boothby baronets, of Broadlow Ash (1660)|Sir William Boothby, Bart.]], but on his death (1846), returned to play many parts, including [[The School for Scandal|Lady Teazle]], Portia, and three dramatic parts created by [[James Sheridan Knowles|Knowles]]: Constantine in the ''Love Chase'' and Helen and Julia in the ''Hunchback''. It was as Lady Teazle that she made her final appearance in 1851.

'''Marina Lavrentievna Popovich''' (née '''Vasiliyeva'''; July 20, 1931 – November 30, 2017) was a [[Soviet Air Force]] colonel, engineer, and decorated Soviet [[test pilot]]. In 1964, she became the third woman and the first Soviet woman to break the [[sound barrier]].&lt;ref name="TASS" /&gt; Known as "Madame MiG", for her work in the Soviet fighter, she set more than one hundred aviation world records on over 40 types of aircraft over her career.&lt;ref name="TASS"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tass.ru/info/4774529 |title=Биография летчика-испытателя Марины Попович |language=Russian |publisher=TASS |date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://exopolitics.blogs.com/exopolitics/2014/05/cosmonaut-marina-popovich-discloses-ufos-to-visit-usa-request-us-government-us-astronauts-to-disclose.html Russian Cosmonaut Marina Popovich discloses UFOs.] - ExopoliticsTV interview with Alfred Lambremont Webre.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Marina Vasilieva was born in 1931 in the [[Velizhsky District]] of [[Smolensk Oblast]], but evacuated with her family to [[Novosibirsk]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/obituaries/marina-popovich-record-breaking-soviet-test-pilot-is-dead.html? |title=Marina Popovich, Record-Breaking Soviet Test Pilot, Is Dead |newspaper=New York Times |date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She began learning to fly as a child but, following the war, the Soviet Union barred women from serving as military pilots. At the age of 16, presenting herself as 22 years old, she wrote to Soviet Marshal [[Kliment Voroshilov]] asking to be admitted to a flying school. Voroshilov intervened on her behalf and she was admitted to the Novosibirsk Aviation Technicum where she graduated in 1951.&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.rt.com/news/411498-record-holder-ufologist-dies/ |title=Legendary female Soviet pilot and UFO hunter, Marina 'Madam MIG' Popovich, dies at 86 |publisher=RT |date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, she worked as an engineer, then later as a flying instructor. In 1962, she entered into the first group of women that would train to become cosmonauts in the Soviet space program. After two months of training, she was turned away from the program.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; Her husband, [[Pavel Popovich]], was admitted to the program, becoming the eighth person in space aboard [[Vostok 4]] in 1962.

She became a [[Soviet Air Force]] pilot in 1963, and in 1964 was admitted as a military test-pilot. Later that year, she broke the sound barrier in a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG 21]]. She entered the military reserves in 1978 and then joined the [[Antonov|Antonov Design Bureau]] as a test pilot. At Antonov, she set ten flight records on the [[Antonov An-22]] turboprop.&lt;ref name="RT" /&gt; She retired in 1984.

She authored nine books and two screenplays. A star in the [[Cancer constellation]] bears her name.&lt;ref name="smolensk"&gt;{{cite web| author = | date =

Marina Popovich, a Russian Writers' Union member, authored nine books, including the poetry collection ''Zhizn – vechny vzlyot'' (Life's An Eternal Rise, 1972).&lt;ref name="astronaut"/&gt; She was a co-author of two film scripts, ''Nebo So Mnoy'' (Sky Is With Me, 1974)&lt;ref&gt;[http://kinofilms.tv/film/nebo-so-mnoj/39615/ Nebo So Mnoy] at kinofilms.tv&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Buket Fialok'' (Bouquet of Violets, 1983).&lt;ref name="astronaut"/&gt;

Popovich died on November 30, 2017. She was buried with [[military honors]] at the [[Federal Military Memorial Cemetery]].

=== Popovich and UFOs ===
Marina Popovich spoke about her experience with UFOs in her book titled ''UFO Glasnost'' (published in 2003 in Germany) and in public lectures and interviews. She claimed that the Soviet military and civilian pilots had confirmed 3000 UFO sightings and that the Soviet Air Force and [[KGB]] had recovered fragments of five crashed UFOs. The crash sites were [[Tunguska event|Tunguska]] (1908), [[Novosibirsk]], [[Tallinn]], [[Ordzhonikidze, Ukraine|Ordzhonikidze]] and [[Height 611 UFO Incident|Dalnegorsk]] (1986).

== Private life ==

Marlon Green was born in [[El Dorado, Arkansas|El Dorado]], [[Arkansas]].

[[File:Tango couple closeup.jpg|thumb|upright|Veteran tango dancers]]
A '''milonguero''' is a person who spends time dancing social [[Tango (dance)|tango]]. The word comes from the term [[Milonga (dance event)|''milonga'']] referring to a tango dance event.

The term was used from the 1870s to mark a man who spent much of his time dancing tango of any style.&lt;ref name=Klein2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Klein |first=Gabriele |title=Tango in Translation: Tanz zwischen Medien, Kulturen, Kunst und Politik |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VodutecZ48C&amp;pg=PA62 |series=Tanz Scripte |volume=19 |year=2009 |publisher=transcript Verlag |isbn=383761204X |pages=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 20th century the term referred to a man immersed in the tango culture specific to Buenos Aires. A milonguero frequented dance halls, dancing to the music of tango, milonga and vals. Such a man was "raised and groomed on tango" and his "reverence for the dance and its traditions" strongly influenced the way he danced.  The term ''milonguero'' was used by ''others'' to distinguish a skilled and courteous dancer, not a term for oneself.&lt;ref name=Romero2010&gt;{{cite book |last=Romero |first=Migdalia |title=Tango Lover's Guide to Buenos Aires: Insights and Recommendations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwMyUNxq1TAC&amp;pg=PA78 |year=2010 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=1440166757 |pages=78–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[Revolución Libertadora|1955 coup]] ousted [[Juan Perón]] in Argentina, the tango was repressed, a sort of "dark age" for tango dancing, ending in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history-of-tango.com/dark-age.html |title=The Dark Age of Tango |author=[[Christine Denniston|Denniston, Christine]] |year=2003 |work=History of Tango |publisher=history-of-tango.com |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the beginning of the 1980s ''milonguero'' also had a strong negative connotation, signaling a womanizer who typically had no job.&lt;ref name=Danteinterview2012&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuralwF3naU |title=Practimilonguero interview with Oscar "Cacho" Dante, dance partner and teacher of Susana Miller |accessdate=Oct 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such womanizers would typically visit downtown milongas and cafes where anonymity was more prevalent than in the clubs of the barrios; the crowded circumstances and the greater intimacy allowed by the greater anonymity fostered a [[close-embrace]] style dancing, which was the motivation of Susana Miller to use the term ''milonguero'' to denote the close embrace style dancing prevalent in downtown milongas.&lt;ref name=Danteinterview2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tangovoice2012&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tangovoice.wordpress.com/2011/07/12/tango-estilo-del-centro-tango-downtown-style-reclaiming-the-term-as-a-replacement-for-tango-milonguero/#comment-378 |title=Tango Estilo del Centro (Tango Downtown Style): Reclaiming the Term as a Replacement for Tango Milonguero - discussion| accessdate=Oct 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''milonguero'' changed to mean one who had been a frequent dancer during [[Tango music#Golden Age|tango's Golden Age]] of the 1930s and '40s&lt;ref name=Denniston2003&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history-of-tango.com/tango-renaissance.html |title=The Tango Renaissance |last=Denniston |first=Christine |year=2003 |work=History of Tango |publisher=history-of-tango.com |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it also lost its negative connotations. Due to the loss of the negative connotations there are more dancers who would nowadays be considered ''milongueros'' - such as many respected and skillful salon style dancers of the barrios -  and hence the identification of the dance of ''milongueros'' with ''milonguero-style tango'' is no longer apt.&lt;ref name=Tangovoice2012/&gt; 

Though there are many individual differences between men, milongueros generally dress conservatively, wearing a sport coat or suit, dress shirt and often a tie. They do not attempt to converse with their partner during a song. They are keenly aware of others on the dance floor and they maintain the "line of dance", a stately progression of all the couples moving counter-clockwise around the dance floor. The milonguero does not bump into or kick other dancers; he employs mostly circular movements to keep an inward focus for himself and his partner, and to allow for small adornments made with the foot. Above all, he interprets the mood of the music with his dancing.&lt;ref name=Romero2010/&gt; He cherishes each musical pause as it comes, and he executes movements that coincide with musical phrases.&lt;ref&gt;Klein 2009, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The milonguero generally selects skillful partners to maintain his reputation. He makes certain to lead his partner into movements that will show her in the best light; he does not show off his own skill to the detriment of his partner. He knows that if he makes the woman look good dancing then he looks good dancing.&lt;ref name=Romero2010/&gt;

He dances to songs from his favorite artists, sitting out the others. Many milongueros prefer music of the Golden Age, especially the marked rhythmic music of [[Juan D'Arienzo]], the older rhythmic pulses of [[Francisco Lomuto]], or the sweeping orchestrations of [[Carlos di Sarli]]. Many milongueros will not dance to a song sung by a female vocalist or—out of great respect—a song sung by [[Carlos Gardel]]. Some take this preference further and will not dance to any song containing lyrics. Modern tangos such as those by [[Astor Piazzolla]] are generally avoided; the transitional later tangos of [[Osvaldo Pugliese]], with their emphasis on tempo changes, are shunned by many but particularly favored by others.&lt;ref name=Romero2010/&gt; Recordings produced before 1983 are preferred.&lt;ref name=Albrecht2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Albrecht |first=Madlen |title=Le développement du Tango à partir de 1983: Un travail sur le changement du Tango de 1983 jusqu'à aujourd'hui |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lq6tU5shpoUC&amp;pg=PA6 |year=2009 |publisher=GRIN Verlag |language=French |isbn=3640390946 |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular tango tunes from the Golden Age never fade for the milonguero: veteran dancer José "Poroto" Oviedo told his friends to "play di Sarli at my wake", a request that was honored at his death in April 2000, the romantic di Sarli song "Bahía Blanca" chosen for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Robert Farris |title=Tango: The Art History of Love |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Ce8NRaM0GYC&amp;pg=PA189 |year=2006 |publisher=Random House Digital |isbn=1400095794 |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the feminine form ''milonguera'' has been used to refer to a woman who is an avid tango dancer, one who goes out dancing as much as possible.&lt;ref name=Washabaugh1998&gt;{{cite book |last=Washabaugh |first=William |title=The Passion of Music and Dance: Body, Gender and Sexuality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3H7I0T1YL1AC&amp;pg=PA98 |year=1998 |publisher=Berg |isbn=1859739091 |pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar terms are ''tanguero'' for a man and ''tanguera'' for a woman.

'''Emidio "Mimi" Soltysik''' (born October 30, 1974) is an American [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] political activist for the [[Socialist Party USA]]. He was the party's nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]].

From October 2013 to October 2015, Soltysik served as National Co-Chair of the Socialist Party USA. Prior to that, he served as National Vice Chair from 2011 to 2013. Soltysik also served as State Chair of the [[Socialist Party of California]] from its chartering in 2011 to 2017.

==Background==
Soltysik graduated from [[Troy University]] and went on to study for an [[Master of Public Administration|MPA]] degree at [[California State University, Northridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mimi for California State Assembly, 62nd District |url=https://mimiforstateassembly.wordpress.com/about/ |accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Soltysik was elected as the male co-chair of the Socialist Party USA for the 2013-2015 term at the party's 2013 national convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2013 Socialist Party USA National Convention |url=http://socialistparty-usa.net/2013-national-convention.html |website=Socialist Party USA |accessdate=2015-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008005114/http://socialistparty-usa.net/2013-national-convention.html |archivedate=2015-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the chair of the Socialist Party of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ready to Kick Ass?|url=http://socialistparty-california.org/ready-to-kick-ass/|website=Socialist Party of California|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California State Assembly election, 2014#District 62|2014]], Soltysik was one of eight candidates in the primary for [[California's 62nd State Assembly district]].&lt;ref name="dryden"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dryden |first1=Carley |title=Eight candidates vying for Steven Bradford’s 62nd Assembly District seat |url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/government-and-politics/20140601/eight-candidates-vying-for-steven-bradfords-62nd-assembly-district-seat |access-date=2015-10-17 |work=[[Daily Breeze]] |date=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under California's [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] system, the top two candidates from the primary, regardless of party, advance to the general election.&lt;ref name="dryden"/&gt; Soltysik finished in 7th place with 2.5% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statewide Direct Primary Election - Statement of Vote, June 3, 2014: State Assemblymember by District |url=http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2014-primary/pdf/84-state-assemblymember.pdf |publisher=California Secretary of State |accessdate=2015-10-17 |page=99 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Soltysik filed a Federal lawsuit&lt;ref&gt;Complaint, ''[https://www.aclusocal.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ECF-No_1-Complaint.pdf Soltysik v. Padilla]'', No. 2:15-cv-7916 (C.D. Cal. filed Oct. 8, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; against the California Secretary of State because he had been required to list "Party Preference: None" on the 2014 primary ballot; the California election law allows candidates to list only a party preference of a qualified party or "None" on the ballot, and the Socialist Party was not a qualified party in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Winger |first1=Richard |title=Two Socialist Party Candidates Sue California to Have Party Label on Ballot |url=http://ballot-access.org/2015/10/08/two-socialist-party-candidates-sue-california-to-have-party-label-on-ballot/ |website=[[Ballot Access News]] |accessdate=2015-10-17 |date=2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monckton Synnot''' (1827-1879) was a prominent [[squatter]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], the sixth son of [[Captain Walter Synnot]] and his second wife Elizabeth, ''née'' Houston, and the grandson of [[Sir Walter Synnot]], of [[Ballymoyer]], [[County Armagh]]. 

Born at the family seat of Ballymoyer, Synnot settled in the colonies in 1836 with his father Captain Walter Synnot and brothers. A year later two elder sons crossed to [[Port Phillip]], followed in 1838 by the next two, Albert and the 12-year-old Monckton. They brought sheep with them and became pioneer landholders at [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]] near [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]], where they remained in various partnerships for about ten years. 

By 1852 they had scattered and Monckton, after a brief sortie with Albert to the Californian and Victorian goldfields, was the only one left in the Little River district, as sole owner of the 26,500-acre (10,724 ha) Mowyong, later called Bareacres.  In 1852 he assisted in the rescue of the survivors of the flood at the Wedge’s Werribee Station and rescued the granddaughter Annie Emily Lawrence (daughter of [[Robert William Lawrence]] and Anne Wedge).  On 25 February 1853 at [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], Melbourne, he married Annie Emily Lawrence. He later bought the South Brighton sheep station in the [[Wimmera]] where, in 1862, he was a member of the first [[Horsham District Roads Board]], and a councillor in 1862-63.

The prize-winning superfine merino wools of the [[Western District, Victoria|Western District]] had been extolled by the Thomas Shaws, C. H. MacKnight, J. L. Currie and others, but in the mid-1860s Synnot's letters to the papers queried their real value and gave rise to a drawn-out and sometimes bitter battle of words. Selling South Brighton in 1868, he bought the large Terrick Terrick station near the [[Murray River]], and for a few years had some share with his brothers Albert, George and Nugent in [[Gunbar, New South Wales|Gunbar]] and Cowl Cowl in the [[Riverina]]. In 1873 he moved to [[Melbourne]], living in ''Ballyreen'', a mansion on Brighton Road, [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]].  He bought large central city premises from the merchants and flour-millers, William Degraves &amp; Co., and set up the Flinders Wool Warehouse in Flinders Lane: in this he followed the lead of his elder brother [[George Synnot|George]] who, opening in Geelong as a stock and station agent, had held one of the first auction sales of wool there in November 1858.

Synnot entered Melbourne wool-broking in prosperous and expansive times, when many firms were offering warehouse services, selling wool by auction or privately, or arranging and often financing its shipping for sale overseas. A pioneer of the wool trade with the East, he visited China, sent a consignment of woollen yarns to Hong Kong and arranged for silk and cotton weavers at [[Ning-Po]] to produce samples of woollen cloth, which were exhibited throughout Australia and New Zealand and at the [[Paris Exhibition of 1878]]. His efforts failed at first, but later that year when the first Japanese Trade Commission visited Australia his ideas bore some fruit.

Synnot died on 23 April 1879 at [[Elsternwick, Victoria|Elsternwick]], aged 52, and was buried in St Kilda general cemetery. The eldest of his seven sons, Monckton Davey Synnot, and three of the younger ones carried on as wool-brokers. Both fathers and his son, Monckton, were tall, handsome, genial and convivial, with the Irish tendency to enjoy a brisk argument, but the senior Monckton was the only one to take any part in public affairs.

He was deported to Algeria on February 28, 2003.

==Life==
In 1994, Ikhlef's brother Nabil also sought entry to Canada as a refugee, but was declined. Nevertheless, he was granted [[permanent resident]] status, and the two brothers would often meet with [[Ahmed Ressam]], [[Fateh Kamal]] and other local Algerians to have coffee and watch television.&lt;ref name="dock"&gt;Docket: DES-8-01, [http://nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/Ikhlef_ReasonsAndOrder.pdf Reasons for Order and Order], March 8, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; His brother claims to have travelled to [[Naples|Naples, Italy]] alone - where [[Il Matino]] magazine published an article stating that both he and Ikhlef were in the country, and [[al-Qaeda]] agents.&lt;ref name="dock"/&gt;

Following his departure, Algeria tried Ikhlef [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] and sentenced him to death for involvement in "terrorism-related activities", which they alleged included travelling to Bosnia and Afghanistan to participate in [[jihad]], and training in weapons and explosives, with both [[al-Qaeda]] and the [[Groupe Islamique Armee]]. Ikhlef denied all the charges to Canadian officials, arguing that the GIA didn't even exist when he left Algeria.&lt;ref name="dock"/&gt;

==Arrest and deportation==
His deportation was carried out by Canadian immigration officials, in a private plane due to the perceived security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Malarek, Globe and Mail, Mar 4, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival Ikhlef was transferred to the control of Algerian [[military police]], the [[Department of Intelligence and Security|DRS]], and immediately put in detention. He was held for 10 days, during which time his family was unable to obtain his whereabouts.  On March 10 he was taken to [[court]] to face three separate charges, but was denied [[legal counsel]].

While acquitted on one count he was sentenced to 7 years, in 2005, based on "membership in a terrorist group." The evidence for this charge was believed to have been based on statements made by the accused while under duress.

Ikhlef was released from prison on March 26, 2006 as part of a national reconciliation program, the controversial [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]], but re-arrested one week later by DRS officials.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, Unrestrained Powers: Torture by Algeria’s Military Security, July 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13136">'''Neal Hazel''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[criminologist]] and [[social policy]] analyst who is best known for his research on youth justice and on family support. He is Professor of [[Criminology]] and [[Criminal Justice]] at the [[University of Salford]] and is the former Her Majesty's Deputy Chief Inspector of [[Probation]] for [[England and Wales]].

==Academic and research career==
Hazel completed his undergraduate degree, [[MSc]] in Applied [[Social Research]] and [[PhD]] in Social Policy at the [[University of Stirling]].  After his doctorate, he was [[Research Fellow]] and Senior Research Fellow at the Policy Research Bureau, London.  He joined the University of Salford in 2003 as a Lecturer and then Senior Lecturer in Criminology, and now holds a [[Personal chair]] in the School of Health and Society. He was the inaugural Director of both the Institute for Public Policy (2013–14) and the Centre for Social Research (2010–14) at the University of Salford. He has directed more than 25 funded research projects, including several national evaluations of criminal justice interventions.&lt;ref name="School website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Neal Hazel|url=https://www.salford.ac.uk/health-and-society/our-staff/health-and-society-academics/neal-hazel|website=School of Health and Society|publisher=University of Salford|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family research===
Hazel published the first national study of the impact of poverty and disadvantage on parenting in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Ann|title=Book Review: Parenting in Poor Environments|journal=Social Work Education|date=2003|volume=22|issue=6|pages=631–632}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reported in the book ''Parenting in Poor Environments'' (2002, with Deborah Ghate), the study of coping and support for families living in poverty was described by Bob Holman in the ''British Journal of Social Work'' as "an important study which lifts the curtain on if and how poor parents cope in deprived areas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holman|first1=Bob|title=Book Review: Parenting in Poor Environments|journal=British Journal of Social Work|date=2004|volume=31|issue=1|pages=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Community Care]]'' stated that its "crucial findings" formed "an emphatic message to practitioners" to ensure more evidence-based support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=John|title=Parenting in Poor Environments Review|journal=Community Care|date=12 Feb 2004|issue=1509|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also conducted the United Kingdom's first national study of parental discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanko|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Meanings of Violence|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-30129-7|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its findings led to a national campaign by the [[NSPCC]] in 2005 against the physical punishment of children.&lt;ref name="SEEK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof Neal Hazel|url=http://www.seek.salford.ac.uk/profiles/NHAZEL.jsp|website=SEEK: Salford Environment for Expert and Knowledge|publisher=University of Salford|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazel’s book on ''Engaging Fathers in Preventive Services'' (2000, with Debrorah Ghate and Catherine Shaw) introduced the concept of “gender differentiated” parenting support.  The research challenged existing feminised family services by showing the importance of catering to the particular needs and experiences of men in order to engage them.  This approach has since been adopted as a standard requirement of family services by policy makers in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olly|first1=Roger|editor1-last=Potter|editor1-first=Carol|editor2-last=Olley|editor2-first=Roger|title=Engaging Fathers in the Early Years|date=2012|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-1069-5|pages=49–50|chapter=Engaging Fathers in the Antenatal and Post-natal Periods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal justice research===
Hazel conducted the first study of young offenders' views of their experiences throughout the criminal justice system in England. He also produced the official government evaluation of the main youth custodial sentence in England and Wales (the Detention and Training Order) and several evaluations of government schemes for resettlement (reentry) after prison.&lt;ref name="School website" /&gt;  His 2001 article revealing common patterns behind the rise and fall of types of youth custodial institutions (with Ann Hagell) is listed by ''[[Youth Justice (journal)]]'' as both one of its most cited and most read articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most-cited articles as of March 1, 2016|url=http://yjj.sagepub.com/reports/most-cited|website=Youth Justice|publisher=Sage Journals|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hazel's cross-national analysis of youth justice systems (2008) is used as the basis of international comparisons in [[Ministry of Justice]] official youth justice statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Youth Justice Statistics 2011/12|date=31 January 2013|publisher=Ministry of Justice|pages=78–79|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279905/yjb-stats-2011-12.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also used and credited in the 2013 documentary film, [[Kids for Cash]].&lt;ref name="SEEK" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kids for Cash Press Notes|url=http://kidsforcashthemovie.com/wp-content/uploads/KIDS_FOR_CASH_Press_Notes_061914.pdf|website=Kids for Cash The Movie|accessdate=31 March 2016|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His framework and five principles for effective reentry support for juvenile offenders (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Russell Webster|title=A theory of change for resettlement|url=http://www.russellwebster.com/bycresettlement/ |accessdate=7 October 2018|format=News|date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report puts forward new approach to stop young people reoffending|url=https://www.salford.ac.uk/news/articles/2017/report-puts-forward-new-approach-to-stop-young-people-reoffending |accessdate=7 October 2018|format=News|date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; were described by the Youth Justice Minister as "a gold standard for resettlement planning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nacro Annual Report 2018|date=October 2018|publisher=Nacro|page=26|url=https://www.nacro.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Nacro-Annual-Report-17-18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have since been adopted by the [[Ministry of Justice]], [[HM Prison and Probation Service]] and [[Youth Justice Board]] as a common policy approach to reform youth detention across England and Wales, called ''Constructive Resettlement''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How to make resettlement constructive|date=11 September 2018|publisher=Youth Justice Board|page=13|url=https://yjresourcehub.uk/yjb-effective-practice/youth-justice-kits/item/download/723_b535da3b3f0716677b9964ec93870ca6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other publications from the same research programme (Beyond Youth Custody) with [[Nacro]] include a report revealing psychological suffering by young people after release from custody (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Layla Haidrani|title=Fears over release force some young people into custody|url=https://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1149765/fears-over-release-force-some-young-people-back-to-custody|website=Children and Young People Now|accessdate=7 October 2018|format=News|date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new model for how to address the specific needs of girls and young women leaving prison (2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Diana Ruthven|title=New research addresses worrying gap in knowledge about resettlement of girls and young women|url=http://www.t2a.org.uk/2014/08/06/new-research-addresses-worrying-gap-in-knowledge-about-resettlement-of-girls-and-young-women/|website=T2A Transition to Adulthood|accessdate=15 February 2016|format=News|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and guidance on ensuring better engagement from young offenders (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alistair Love|title=An evaluation of Reaching Your Potential: A Youth in Focus Project|date=2015|publisher=YMCA|page=10|url=https://issuu.com/siane8/docs/an_evaluation_of_reaching_your_pote}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public appointments==
In 2013, Hazel was appointed as an advisor to the [[HM Inspectorate of Probation]] (HMIP) for inspection of services across England and Wales for youth reentry after detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Joint thematic inspection of resettlement services to children by Youth Offending Teams and partner agencies|date=March 2015|publisher=Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation|url=https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmiprobation/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/03/Youth-Resettlement_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2014 to 2015, he served in the newly created role of Her Majesty's Deputy Chief Inspector of Probation for England and Wales, responsible for strategy at HMIP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to move up from a researcher post to lecturer|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/how-to-move-up-from-a-researcher-post-to-lecturer/2017892.article|accessdate=27 March 2016|format=News|agency=Times Higher Education|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his time at HMIP, he designed a method of inspecting criminal justice agencies that focused on evaluating whether and how services were impacting on offenders, rather than the previous practice of auditing services' processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Academic appointed as Her Majesty's Deputy Chief Inspector of Probation|url=http://www.newlawjournal.co.uk/nlj/content/professor-neal-hazel|accessdate=25 March 2016|format=News|agency=New Law Journal|date=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also introduced the strategic aim for HMIP to improve the wellbeing of children at risk of reoffending, and a peer review system to check the quality of inspection reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salford criminologist at top of HM Inspectorate of Probation|url=http://www.salford.ac.uk/news/articles/2015/salford-demonstrates-its-place-in-the-world-through-a-professorial-secondment|website=University of Salford press release|publisher=University of Salford|accessdate=2 March 2016|date=16 Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, he was appointed by the [[Secretary of State for Justice]] to sit on the [[Youth Justice Board]] (YJB), responsible for overseeing the youth justice system in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Appointment of 10 members of the Youth Justice Board|url=http://www.gov.uk/government/news/appointment-of-10-members-of-the-youth-justice-board|accessdate=30 September 2018|website=Gov.uk|publisher=Ministry of Justice|date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was previously a member of the YJB's Expert Advisory Board for developing government policy on youth reentry after detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Reoffending Investigation Evidence|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_migrate_files_destination/Evidence.pdf|website=London Assembly|publisher=Mayor of London|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicholas Groff''' (born April 19, 1980)&lt;ref name=excerpt&gt;{{cite web|work=The Travel Channel|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/ghost-adventures/articles/nick-groffs-chasing-spirits|title=Nick Groff's Chasing Spirits|accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[paranormal investigation|paranormal investigator]], musician, and television personality. Groff is currently the lead investigator for the television series ''[[Paranormal Lockdown]]'' and the ''Ghosts of Shepherdstown''. He was a co-investigator and executive producer of ''[[Ghost Adventures]]'', as well as an editor and cameraman for the show from seasons 1–10. Groff was an executive producer for a show on the [[Travel Channel]] called ''Vegas Stripped'', a behind-the-scenes look at the operations of the [[South Point Hotel, Casino &amp; Spa]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/company/co0370647/?ref_=tt_dt_co|title=Groff Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Groff was born April 19, 1980 in [[San Jose, California]], and grew up in [[Nashua, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name=excerpt/&gt; He graduated from [[Pelham High School (New Hampshire)|Pelham High School]] in New Hampshire and later studied film at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], where he met Aaron Goodwin. At the age of eight he fell out of a tree in the yard of his family's home in [[Salem, New Hampshire]], which Groff described as "a near-death experience".

Two years later, while at home alone, he says he saw a ghostly figure of a [[African Americans|black]] man. In a 2012 interview, Groff questioned, "Was it my imagination? Or was it something from my accident that made me more open to their [[African-American culture|world]]?"&lt;ref name="lex"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kentucky.com/2012/09/27/2352471/scarefest-2012-ghost-adventures.html#storylink=misearch |title=Scarefest 2012: 'Ghost Adventures' host fell into his career |last=Copley |first=Rich |date=September 27, 2012 |work=[[Lexington Herald-Leader]] |publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groff was allegedly possessed in [[Natchez, Mississippi]] during the investigation of [[King's Tavern]].

==''Ghost Adventures''==

      <comment>/* Criminal career */ The article said Rigo was released from prison on 9 December 1989 based on the amnesty of president Vaclav Havel. This cannot possibly be true. Vaclav Havel was not president of Czechoslovakia on 9 December 1989 and his amnesty dates 3 January 1990. If he was indeed released on 9 December, it was not related to president Havel and his amnesty.</comment>

'''Ondrej Rigo''' (born 17 December 1955) is a [[Slovak people|Slovak]] [[serial killer]] and [[necrophile]] who targeted women in [[Bratislava]], [[Munich]] and [[Amsterdam]] from 1990 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}}http://www.vpsmvbrno.cz/muzeumzla/rigo/rigo_a.html&lt;/ref&gt; Currently serving a life sentence for nine murders and one attempted murder in [[Leopoldov Prison]] in [[Slovakia]], Rigo is a [[schizoid personality disorder]] sufferer and an [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial psychopath]] while also being a [[necrophile]], finding pleasure in having intercourse with women with mutilated heads. Rigo remains the Slovak murderer with the highest number of victims and he is also the most prolific serial killer in modern [[Slovak history]]. He is eligible to apply for [[parole]] in 2019.

== Early life ==


Ondrej Rigo has a brother, living in [[Germany]], and a daughter. According to an article in Slovak newspaper ''[[SME (newspaper)|SME]]'' Rigo is of [[Romani people|Roma]] ethnicity. Even as an adult, Rigo was a short man. When he was 14 he was taken into a youth corrective institution and later into an [[orphanage]] together with his siblings. They stayed there for a year, having been taken from their mother after their father's arrest. Rigo's mother died in 2000 after being hit by a car. Learning of her death is the one time he remembers crying in his life. His father died during a burglary. Rigo claims he liked both parents.

{{cquote|''(My) parents were good, they didn't beat me.''|20px|20px|Ondrej Rigo recalls his childhood in 2007.|}}

He was married two times. His first marriage was during military service (compulsory in [[Czechoslovakia]] at that time), but "when we returned to Bratislava she started to become jealous. You know, an Easterner (''note: meaning from Eastern Slovakia, a culturally and linguistically distinct region of the country''), so she returned to [[Poprad]]. I went with her to say goodbye at the station," recalls Rigo. Little is known about his second marriage. The woman he was with in the movie theatre on the night of his last murder is being referred to as his "partner".

===Legal occupation===
[[Image:Grossmann bezrucova.JPG|thumb|right|Ondrej Rigo worked in the heater room of this hospital in [[Bratislava]] on Bezručova Street.]]
In [[Bratislava]], Rigo worked in Hotel Carlton, where he was arrested. Before that he worked as a fireman in a heater room in Pravda newspaper and in a hospital on Bezručova street and a hospital on Šulekova street, having also completed his gasman certificate (''plynárske skúšky'' in Slovak).

===Criminal career===
Before his first murder, Rigo had already been convicted of crimes 11 times. He was a criminal from an early age, focusing mainly on home [[burglaries]]. The last time he was in police custody in Slovakia (at that time [[Czechoslovakia]]) was from September 28, 1989 to December 9, 1989 because of unauthorised leaving of the Republic.

After the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]] and end of communism in Czechoslovakia, people were allowed once again to travel freely in Europe and Rigo continued with his crimes abroad. On December 9, 1989, the same day he was released from prison, and a mere three weeks after the start of the [[Velvet Revolution]], he traveled to [[Vienna]] without any valid passport. There, he acquired a fake [[Yugoslavia]]n passport in the name of "Nedo Ikic". Later, he traveled to West Germany to meet his brother. In [[Bavaria]] he asked for asylum using his fake passport. He was, however, sentenced by the German authorities to two months in prison for forging documents. He spent his sentence in a prison in [[Bad Reichenhall]]. After his release from prison, Rigo escaped from a refugee camp and traveled to [[Munich]] where he continued his burglaries and started his killing spree.

== Modus operandi ==
An important factor in Ondrej Rigo's conviction was his consistent [[modus operandi]]:
* His attacks occurred during the night or very early in the morning
* He wore his socks on his hands at all times during the attacks in order not to leave any [[fingerprint]]s
* He would sneak into apartments in the basements, on the ground floor or with easy access via the balcony, usually entering through a window
* He would always pick women sleeping alone (except in the case of Anna P. and her son Juraj N.) and beat them to death with a metal rod, wooden stick or a rock, always hitting the head
* The murder weapon is always left at the crime scene
* After killing the victim he would cover the victim's upper body with a [[blanket]]. Then he would copulate with the [[necrophilia|body]] both vaginally and [[anal intercourse|anally]]. Sometimes, he would mutilate the body some more during intercourse
* He smoked at the crime scenes and threw cigarette butts on the floor
* Usually, he robbed the victims of some easy to carry valuables

After arriving at Munich, Rigo murdered twice in three months. His first victim, Helena S. (40), probably surprised Rigo while he was burglarizing her apartment. "He killed her and got aroused sexually," recalls Anton Heretik, author of Rigo's psychological evaluation during investigation. On the night from June 7 to June 8, 1990, he sneaked through a partially open window into the ground floor bedroom of Helena S. at an unspecified location in Munich. Rigo smashed her head with a 2.5 kilogram metal pipe, wrapped the upper part of her body in a [[blanket]] and copulated with her. Before leaving he stole some easy to carry valuables according to some sources, while according to others he stole nothing at all. He disposed of the murder weapon directly beneath the bedroom window.

On the night between 31 July and 1 August 1 1990, Rigo sneaked through the partially open balcony door and into the Munich apartment of Ilke Z., 28, murdering her, again using a metal pipe. Rigo stabbed her in the neck with a [[screwdriver]], most probably during the act of copulation. He performed both vaginal and anal intercourse with her. Afterwards, he covered up the body and searched the house for valuables, finding a golden necklace and an unknown amount of German marks, which he stole. The murder weapon and a man's sock was later found by the [[German police]] at the crime scene.

In October, Rigo left Munich for [[Amsterdam]] to visit his sister Helena. Maria van der W. (58) was a woman living alone in Amsterdam with cats. During the night of September 27, 1990, Rigo sneaked into her ground floor apartment through a partially open balcony window and killed her with a stone weighing over 5.5 kilograms (probably a pavement [[cobblestone]]). He stripped the body naked and copulated with it. Again he robbed his victim, stealing a camera, a women's wristwatch, two boxes containing coins and some other valuables. In the kitchen, he found a bottle of [[slivovica]] and drank it. Later in court, one of the witnesses would testify that Rigo had a liking for this particular drink.

Rigo left for Bratislava, Slovakia the day following the murder. His killings continued with the murder of Terézia R. (88) inside a [[retirement home]] in Bratislava, on October 6, 1990. He murdered her with his fist while she was sleeping. The retirement home reported prayer books, rosary and 4000 Slovak Crowns as missing. Underneath the balcony, the police found some Dutch coins and cigarette butts with Rigo's biological material on them.

[[Image:Terezia R..jpg|thumb|left|Terézia R., 88, Rigo's oldest victim]]
On January 3, 1991, early in the morning, the bodies of Anna P. (40) and her son Juraj N. (14-16 depends on the source) were found inside a ground floor flat in a dormitory, at an unspecified location in Bratislava. Rigo entered the apartment through a window around midnight. The son was sleeping beside his mother when Rigo crushed their heads with a wooden stick. Anna P. tried to protect her son. Afterwards, Rigo copulated with her body. Anna P., who emigrated to Switzerland in 1982 with her son and husband, was in Bratislava with her son just for a few days for New Year's.

Jana B. (31) became the first person to survive Rigo's attack on January 9, 1991, when she managed to fight him off after being attacked in her probably first-floor Bratislava apartment on Kutuzovova street. Her quick decision to fight coupled with a poor weapon choice on Rigo's part allowed her to come out of the confrontation only with some wounds. Rigo gained access through a ventilation window above the door. After the unsuccessful attack, he quickly fled the apartment. Jana B. noticed that Rigo's light-blue pants were hand-sewn in the crotch area which later helped in identifying him. The police indeed found such pants in his closet. The same night before this attack, Rigo entered through another window in the neighborhood, but it led only into a small locked storage room.

Three weeks after his last kill and two weeks after the attack on Jana B., at an unspecified date, he murdered Helena N. (79) near Záhradnícka street in Bratislava. This was on the same street as the last murder scene according to some sources, or very near the last murder scene, according to others. Rigo removed a net from the kitchen window of this ground floor apartment, killing Helena N. with a piece of [[concrete]].

[[Image:Obchodná street in Bratislava 04773.JPG|thumb|120px|right|Obchodná street in Bratislava, 13 years after the murder.]]
Henrieta O. (22) was attacked on July 14, 1991. Rigo gained access to her Bratislava apartment through the window, which she probably left open because it was a hot summer. She was playing on her guitar late into the night. Rigo smashed her head, raped her and robbed her, leaving her for dead. Henrieta O. however survived the attack but died 18 days later. Together with Henrieta O. there was also her grandmother sleeping in another room of the apartment. She was practically deaf and didn't hear Rigo raping her fatally injured granddaughter.

The last victim, Matilda U. (67), was murdered on March 4, 1992, in the center of Bratislava in a porch house in Obchodná street. That night, Rigo was in movie theater Dukla (today known as YMCA) on Šancová street together with his girlfriend. They were returning home together when he suddenly told her that he had to take care of something and got off the [[trolleybus]]. He didn't come home until morning.

According to an article in Časopis Šarm, there is another unnamed victim from Bratislava, killed with a knife, which was never proved to Rigo. The victim was a woman found in the morning by her son sleeping in his child's room. The murder is considered unsolved as of 2008.

Rigo gave some of the items he stole from his victims to his unnamed daughter.

== Arrest and sentencing ==

=== Arrest ===
[[Image:Hotel Radisson Blu Carlton, Bratislave, P1010408.jpg|thumb|left|The place of Rigo's arrest - Hotel Carlton, [[Hviezdoslavovo námestie (Bratislava)|Hviezdoslavovo Square]] in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]].]]

{{cquote|''He was still in trance, like a snake who just swallowed its prey. There were traces of blood on his shoes and trousers and inside his locker there were jewels belonging to the victim.''|20px|20px|former investigator JUDr. Jozef Vachálek recalls Ondrej Rigo's arrest|}}

Ondrej Rigo was arrested by the Slovak criminal police on March 4, 1992, only hours after his last murder. He was arrested by Vachálek and probably some other policemen in Hotel Carlton on [[Hviezdoslavovo námestie (Bratislava)|Hviezdoslavovo Square]] in [[Bratislava]], where he was employed as a [[cloakroom]] attendant. At the time of his arrest he was still without his [[socks]] on, which he used in the attack.

Later, he would claim that the blood on him was syrup and that his sperm found on the victims was arranged by a prostitute from an erotic club. He explained his footprints beneath the balconies and cigarette butts by claiming he was there by chance and had to pee or that he was curious and took a look through some windows. He explained his possession of jewelry by saying that women often gave him gifts.

Jana B., the only survivor of his crimes, clearly saw Rigo's face because inside the apartment where she fought with Rigo, there was some light from a streetlight outside. She would later actually attend his trial wearing a [[wig]] to remain unnoticed. The criminal police of [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] investigated Rigo's murders separately. It was only after his arrest that they started cooperating on the case.

=== Trial ===
[[File:Vstup do leopldovskej vaznice.jpg|thumb|right|Main entrance of the prison where Rigo is serving his life sentence in [[Leopoldov]], [[Slovakia]]]]
Ondrej Rigo was sentenced on December 7, 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{sk icon}}http://www.sme.sk/c/2139120/medzinarodny-vrah-ondrej-rigo-odsudeny-na-dozivotie.html&lt;/ref&gt; by the City court of [[Bratislava]] after a trial that lasted 10 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}}http://new-arch.rp.pl/artykul/36339_Seryjny_morderca_skazany_na_Slowacji.html&lt;/ref&gt; A senate headed by Peter Šamko sentenced him to [[life imprisonment]] in the "third class", which means highest security prison in Slovakia. When details of his crimes were read to him in court, Rigo did not react in any way. He was sitting rigidly and leaning a bit forward, his face showing no emotion throughout the trial. 
His file consisted of 5500 pages.

As explained by Šamko, the sentence was chosen based on directly or indirectly proven nine murders, based on especially brutal way in which he committed the murders and based on the fact that possibilities of his resocialization are quite limited and the prognosis is bad. There was also [[DNA]] evidence presented to the court consisting of blood analysis and analysis of semen from the victims' vaginas, as well as testimonies of 194 witnesses (including witnesses from Germany and Netherlands).

Rigo never pleaded guilty to any of the murders and he does not feel guilty.

Rigo has appealed the first-order court's sentence. In his appeal, he claims he is innocent, without giving any kind of proof.

Rigo's appeal process at the Supreme Court of Slovakia started on February 27, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{sk icon}}http://mesto.sk/prispevky_velke/bratislava/oodvolacomkonanis825424920.phtml&lt;/ref&gt; During his finishing speech, the representative of the General Prosecutor Office of Slovakia Ivan Segeš proposed to confirm the [[life imprisonment]] sentence because Rigo's guilt has been proven once again in the appeal process. On February 28, 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{sk icon}}http://mesto.sk/prispevky_velke/bratislava/ozamietnutiodvolan825508140.phtml&lt;/ref&gt; the senate of the Highest Court of Slovak Republic denied Rigo's appeal and confirmed his sentence. There is no other appeal possible.

After serving several years in [[Ilava]] prison, Rigo was transferred to [[Leopoldov Prison]].

== Personality and psychopathological profile ==
According to court appointed [[psychologist]] Anton Heretik, author of Rigo's psychological profile during the trial, Rigo is a [[psychopath]]. "He does not accept any social norms, he is lacking empathy and behaves very impulsively. At the same time he is a schizoid personality, unable to create relationships with others. He has strange thoughts and hobbies, he is a loner. He is a combination of schizoid and antisocial psychopath, creating a very dangerous type of criminal", claims Heretik.&lt;ref&gt;{{sk icon}}http://www.mojcasopis.sk/zaujimave/tema/136-krvave-celebrity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his psychological profile, the strangeness, lack of hospitality and language barrier in a foreign country could have influenced his later behavior. Rigo was found by the psychologists to not be a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]].

According to Rigo's investigator Jozef Vachálek, "(he) had low IQ and seldom talked".

While incarcerated in Ilava prison, Rigo behaved according to the norms most of the time, but according to pedagogist Daniel Blaško from Ilava prison, he would "often react too aggressively". "Chances for his correction are zero", says Blaško. According to him, it was difficult to communicate with Rigo, because he seldom said a coherent sentence.

== Survivor ==
The Slovak artist Jana B. is the only person to survive an attack by Rigo. She attended [[karate]] classes for several years. Jana B. was attacked around 2:30 in the night while sleeping in her apartment on Kutuzovova street in Bratislava's third district on January 9, 1991. She returned home an hour after midnight and went to sleep. Rigo gained access to the apartment via a ventilation window above the door. A ladder was found leaning against the "pavlač".

"I was woken up by a hit to the head and I saw a man standing by my bed. At first I thought I'm dreaming, because I was living alone but when I received another hit to the head I woke up and the wooden shaft from a [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] Rigo stole outside, on the building's yard, broke, because it was moldy," she recalls. Jana B. jumped from her bed and started defending herself immediately with the broken piece of wood. When Rigo walked to the door, unlocking it from inside, she threw a chair at him. In the kitchen, he wrestled Jana B. onto a hot gas oven. "The skin on my legs and stomach started to burn", she recalls. They fell on the ground wrestling, then Rigo stood up and started punching her to the head. At this moment Jana B. grabbed him by his [[Human male genitalia|genitals]] and squeezed them. "He was just trying to gouge out my eye", she remembers. She doesn't remember whether Rigo screamed or not, but the rest of the fight before was silent. He then quickly fled the apartment while Jana B. alarmed the neighbor by banging on the wall, instructing him to call the police. Another neighbor, woken up by her son who was alarmed by the noise, found Jana B in shock and savagely beaten.

The neighbor told the police he heard some weird noises but he thought Jana B. was probably framing pictures in the middle of the night. After the attack, her wounds required several weeks to heal. According to Jana B.'s mother, the worst thing was that Rigo was caught over a year after the attack on her daughter, all the time knowing he might come back to finish the job. Years later, Jana B. claims she has no psychological trauma from the attack and she is not interested in Rigo.

{{cquote|''Why should I move? Where is it safer? In [[Petržalka]]? Rigo is not interesting to me. I have no trauma from him, I don't feel anything, he doesn't mean anything to me. I don't want to talk about him, read about him or know anything about him.''|20px|20px|Jana B., the only survivor of Ondrej Rigo's attacks, when interviewed by Šarm in 2008|}}

Jana B. never moved from the flat she was attacked in and as of 2008 she continues to live there.&lt;ref&gt;{{sk icon}}http://sarm.pluska.sk/sarm/skutocne-pribehy/ondrej-rigo-ja-viem-ze-ma-nenavidia.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources claim she bought a dog and had to have lights on during the night for seven years after the attack, afterwards finally moving out from the apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{sk icon}}http://www.cas.sk/clanok/179789/oprasene-dramy-mlada-zena-prezila-utok-9-nasobneho-vraha.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* ''Beštia'' ({{lang-en|The Beast}}), a [[detective novel]] by Slovak author Dominik Dán, published in Slovakia in July 2006 is a semi-fictionalised story of Ondrej Rigo. It details the atmosphere of the aftermath of President [[Václav Havel]]'s amnesty from 1990 which released many criminals from prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{sk icon}}http://www.martinus.sk/?uItem=27439&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Short description|American colonist who rejected British rule in the American Revolution}}
{{about|the Patriots in the [[American Revolution]]||Patriot (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Sprit of '76.2.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|''The Spirit of '76'' (originally entitled ''[[Yankee Doodle]]''), painted by [[Archibald Willard]] in the late nineteenth century, an iconic image relating to the [[Spirit of '76 (sentiment)|patriotic sentiment]] surrounding the [[American Revolutionary War]]]]
'''Patriots''' (also known as '''Revolutionaries''', '''Continentals''', '''Rebels''', or '''American Whigs''') were those colonists of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] who rejected British rule during the [[American Revolution]] and [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared]] the United States of America as an independent nation in July 1776.  Their decision was based on the political philosophy of [[republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] as expressed by spokesmen such as [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[John Adams]], and [[Thomas Paine]].  They were opposed by the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] who supported continued British rule.

Patriots represented the spectrum of social, economic, and ethnic backgrounds. They included lawyers such as [[John Adams]], students such as [[Alexander Hamilton]], planters such as [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[George Mason]], merchants such as [[Alexander McDougall]] and [[John Hancock]], and farmers such as [[Daniel Shays]] and [[Joseph Plumb Martin]]. They also included slaves and freemen such as [[Crispus Attucks]], the first martyr of the American Revolution; [[James Armistead Lafayette]], who served as a double agent for the [[Continental Army]]; and [[Jack Sisson]], leader of the first successful [[black operation]] mission in American history under the command of Colonel [[William Barton (soldier)|William Barton]], resulting in the capture of British General [[Richard Prescott]].

==Terms==
The critics of British rule called themselves "Whigs" after 1768, identifying with members of the British [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] party who favored similar colonial policies. In Britain at the time, the word "patriot" had a negative connotation and was used as a negative epithet for "a factious disturber of the government", according to [[Samuel Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;"Patriot" in ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (3rd ed. online 2011). [https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/138899 accessed 19 December 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Revolution, colonists who supported British authority called themselves ''[[Tory|Tories]]'' or ''[[royalist]]s'', identifying with the political philosophy of [[traditionalist conservatism]] dominant in Great Britain.  During the Revolution, these persons became known primarily as ''[[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]''.  Afterward, many emigrated north to the remaining British territories in [[Canada]].  There they called themselves the [[United Empire Loyalists]].

==Influence==
Many Patriots were active before 1775 in groups such as the [[Sons of Liberty]], and the most prominent leaders are referred to today by Americans as the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]].  They represented a cross-section of the population of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and came from many different backgrounds. According to Robert Calhoon, between 40 and 45 percent of the white population in the Thirteen Colonies supported the Patriots' cause, between 15 and 20 percent supported the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], and the remainder were neutral or kept a low profile.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Calhoon, "Loyalism and neutrality" in {{cite book|author1=Jack P. Greene|author2=J. R. Pole|title=A Companion to the American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xK1NuzpAcH8C&amp;pg=PA235|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The great majority of the Loyalists remained in America, while the minority went to Canada, Britain, [[Spanish Florida|Florida]], or the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Allen, ''Tories: Fighting for the King in America's First Civil War'' (2011) p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations==
Historians have explored the motivations that pulled men to one side or the other.&lt;ref&gt;On Patriots see Edwin G. Burrows and Michael Wallace, "The American Revolution: The Ideology and Psychology of National Liberation," Perspectives in American History, (1972) vol. 6 pp. 167–306&lt;/ref&gt; Yale historian [[Leonard Woods Labaree]] used the published and unpublished writings and letters of leading men on each side, searching for how personality shaped their choice. He finds eight characteristics that differentiated the two groups.  Loyalists were older, better established, and more likely to resist innovation than the Patriots. Loyalists felt that the Crown was the legitimate government and resistance to it was morally wrong, while the Patriots felt that morality was on their side because the British government had violated the constitutional rights of Englishmen. Men who were alienated by physical attacks on Royal officials took the Loyalist position, while those who were offended by heavy-handed British rule became Patriots.  Merchants in the port cities with long-standing financial attachments to the British Empire were likely to remain loyal to the system, while few Patriots were so deeply enmeshed in the system. Some Loyalists, according to Labaree, were "procrastinators" who believed that independence was bound to come some day, but wanted to "postpone the moment", while the Patriots wanted to "seize the moment". Loyalists were cautious and afraid of anarchy or tyranny that might come from mob rule; Patriots made a systematic effort to take a stand against the British. Finally, Labaree argues that Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the Patriots' confidence that independence lay ahead.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Woods Labaree, ''Conservatism in Early American History'' (1948) pp. 164–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also N. E. H. Hull, Peter C. Hoffer and Steven L. Allen, "Choosing Sides: A Quantitative Study of the Personality Determinants of Loyalist and Revolutionary Political Affiliation in New York," ''Journal of American History,'' 65#2 (1978), pp. 344–66 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1894084 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==No taxation without representation==
The Patriots rejected taxes imposed by legislatures in which the taxpayer was not represented. "[[No taxation without representation]]" was their slogan, referring to the lack of representation in the British Parliament. The British countered that there was "virtual representation" in the sense that all members of Parliament represented the interests of all the citizens of the British Empire. Some Patriots declared that they were loyal to the king, but they insisted that they should be free to run their own affairs. In fact, they had been running their own affairs since the period of "salutary neglect" before the [[French and Indian War]]. Some radical Patriots tarred and feathered tax collectors and customs officers, making those positions dangerous; according to Benjamin Irvin, the practice was especially prevalent in Boston where many Patriots lived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revolution.h-net.msu.edu/essays/irvin.feathers.html Benjamin H. Irvin, "Tar and Feathers in Revolutionary America," (2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618050604/http://revolution.h-net.msu.edu/essays/irvin.feathers.html |date=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6274">'''Plotino Constantino Rhodakanaty''' ({{lang-el|Πλωτίνος Ροδοκανάκης}}) was a [[Greece|Greek]] (or for others a Mexican) [[socialism|socialist and anarchist]] and a prominent [[Mormons|Mormon]] pioneer who was an early activist in [[Mexico|Mexico's]] mid-nineteenth century labor and campesino movement, foreshadowing the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910.

==Biography==
According to many, Rhodakanaty was born on October 14, 1828 in Athens, Greece to a member of Greek nobility and his Austrian wife. Rhodakanaty's father died after the Greek war for independence against the Turks, and his mother took him to Vienna. In 1848, Rhodakanaty traveled to Budapest to assist in the failed [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian uprising]] of that year. He supposed to traveled next to Berlin where he was exposed to the ideas of [[Hegel]], [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]], and [[Proudhon]]. In 1850, he visited Paris specifically to meet Proudhon after reading the latter's ''What Is Property?'' While in Paris, he learned of Mexico's rural system of relatively self-governing agricultural communities and of the threat to them presented by capitalism and privatization. He supported the effort to save them and went to Barcelona where he lived for at least two years in the large anarchist community there. Rhodakanaty planned to help save that way of life in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Hart, John M 1931"&gt;Hart, John M. Anarchism &amp; The Mexican Working Class, 1860-1931. Austin, TX: University of Texas Press, 1987. 29-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moses Thatcher]] believed that the mother of Rhodakanaty was born in Mexico. Some believed that he was a Mexican who adapt a persona. Others believed that he was born in London.&lt;ref&gt;Reviewed Work: Rhodakanaty y la Formación del Pensamiento Socialista en México (Rhodakanaty and the Shaping of Socialist Thought in Mexico) by Carlos Illades Review by: Dale Beecher Journal of Mormon History Vol. 31, No. 1 (Spring 2005), pp. 186-190 Published by: University of Illinois Press; Mormon History Association https://www.jstor.org/stable/23289258&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861, the same year he arrived in Mexico, he wrote ''Cartilla Socialista'' and began propagating the ideas of contemporary European thinkers, particularly Fourier, Proudhon, and Bakunin. He published other radical essays, characterized by his famous quote "Down with all governments" (abajo con todos los gobiernos). including ''Neopanteísmo'', founded journals, and in 1870 helped establish an "escuela libre" at Chalco.  The term "escuela libre" was used by anarchists to distinguish themselves from government- and church-influenced education. The school was run by a disciple of Francisco Zalacosta. 
A student of them with the name [[Julio Lopez Chavez]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://nosotrosmx.com/2017/08/12/la-rebelion-de-julio-lopez-chavez/ La rebelión de Julio López Chávez magazine Nosotros, Manuel Garcés Jiménez, retrieved 4/9/2018]&lt;/ref&gt; went on to lead peasant insurrections involving as many as 1,500 armed guerilla forces at a time in central Mexico. It was the first revolt in Mexico with a political anti-government program.

To support himself, he taught at the Colegio de San Ildefonso in downtown Mexico City, where he organized like-minded students.&lt;ref name="Hart, John M 1931"/&gt; A circle of followers emerged, including Santiago Villanueva, Francisco Zalacosta, Julio Chávez López, and José María Gonzales. These people and others would later form an important  nucleus in the early Mexican labor and peasant movements.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio, José Luis. ''Las internacionales obreras en América''. [[Madrid]]: 1971. p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875 Rhodakanaty read some translated sections of the [[Book of Mormon]], a scripture of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) and gained a conviction about it being "the word of God".&lt;ref&gt;Jason M. Brown and Christopher J. Nielsen: "Plotino Constantino Rhodakanaty: Introduction to a Mormon Anarchist"; available at https://themormonworkerdotnet.wordpress.com/past-issues/mw-issue-8/plotino-constantino-rhodakanaty-introduction-to-a-mormon-anarchist/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the values advocated by the LDS Church, he was also attracted to their communitarian practices at the time, which included communal property and an emphasis on self-reliance. His petitioning the Church's leadership in [[Salt Lake City]] for [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]] to be sent to Mexico, as well as his efforts to convert his friends and acquaintances, were instrumental in the subsequent establishment of the LDS Church in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry R. Flake: "Mormons in Mexico: The First 96 Years"; available at https://www.lds.org/ensign/1972/09/mormons-in-mexico-the-first-96-years&lt;/ref&gt; Plotino Rhodakanaty was baptized a Mormon on November 20, 1879 along with several other converts, and was appointed to lead the local congregation. After not receiving the Church's support for his plans to create the utopian communities he envisioned in Mexico, Rhodakanaty resigned as the head of the congregation in August 1880 and became disengaged from the LDS Church. There is no indication, however, that he also rescinded his membership.

In his older age he moved to [[Ajusco]] in the mountains southwest of Mexico City. He taught in that small school throughout the time that [[Otilio Montaño]], the author of Emiliano Zapata's famous [[Plan de Ayala]], attended as a young student. The Plan de Ayala closely related Rhodakanaty's goal of a democratic and self-governing society in rural Mexico.

Rhodakanaty eventually returned to Europe in 1886. The time and place of his death remains unknown. There is a claim that it was 1890 in Mexico.

[[Image:ClarkeViola.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Clarke with viola in 1919]]
'''Rebecca Clarke''' (27 August 1886&amp;nbsp;– 13 October 1979) was an English classical [[composer]] and [[violist]] best known for her [[chamber music]] featuring the [[viola]]. She was born in [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] and studied at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] and [[Royal College of Music]] in London, later becoming one of the first female professional orchestral players. Stranded in the United States at the outbreak of World War II, she settled permanently in New York City and married composer and pianist [[James Friskin]] in 1944. Clarke died at her home in New York at the age of 93.

Although Clarke's output was not large, her work was recognised for its compositional skill and artistic power. Some of her works have yet to be published (and many were only recently published); those that were published in her lifetime were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship and interest in her compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote the study and performance of her music.

==Early life==
[[File:Royal College of Music - April 2007.jpg|thumb|left|London's [[Royal College of Music]] where Clarke studied from 1907 to 1910]]

Clarke was born in [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]], England, to Joseph Thacher Clarke, an American, and his German wife, Agnes Paulina Marie Amalie Helferich.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; Her father was interested in music, and Clarke started on violin after sitting in on lessons that were being given to her brother, [[Hans Thacher Clarke|Hans Thatcher Clarke]], who was 15 months her junior.&lt;ref name="curtis-reader"/&gt; She began her studies at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in 1903, but was withdrawn by her father in 1905 after teacher [[Percy Hilder Miles]] proposed to her (he later left her his [[Stradivarius]] [[violin]] in his will). She made the first of many visits to the United States shortly after leaving the Royal Academy.&lt;ref name="curtis-reader"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Rebecca Clarke Reader|last=Curtis|first=Liane|publisher=Rebecca Clarke Society|year=2005|isbn=978-0-9770079-0-5|editor=Curtis, Liane|location=|pages= 185|chapter=Violist to Violist: Nancy Uscher's Interview with Rebecca Clarke Friskin}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then attended the [[Royal College of Music]] from 1907 to 1910, becoming one of Sir [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]'s first female composition students.&lt;ref name="id"/&gt; At Stanford's urging she shifted her focus from the violin to the viola, just as the latter was coming to be seen as a legitimate solo instrument.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; She studied with [[Lionel Tertis]], who was considered by some the greatest violist of the day.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ponder, Michael|title=Clarke, Rebecca Helferich (1886–1979)|work= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/61135}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 she composed a setting of Chinese poetry, called "Tears", in collaboration with a group of fellow students at RCM.&lt;ref name="curtis-reader"/&gt; She also sang under the direction of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] in a student ensemble organized by Clarke to study and perform [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]]'s music.&lt;ref name="curtis-reader"/&gt;

Following her criticism of his extra-marital affairs, Clarke's father turned her out of the house and cut off her funds.&lt;ref name="cd"&gt;{{cite AV media notes|author=Ponder, Michael|year=2000|title=Rebecca Clarke: Midsummer Moon|id=Dutton Laboratories}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had to leave the Royal College in 1910 and supported herself through her viola playing. Clarke became one of the first female professional orchestral musicians when she was selected by Sir [[Henry Wood]] to play in the Queen's Hall Orchestra in 1912.&lt;ref name="id"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Curtis, Liane|date=May 1996|url=http://www.rebeccaclarke.org/pdf/identity.pdf|title=A Case of Identity|journal=Musical Times|pages=15–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{cite web|author=Curtis, Liane|title=Rebecca Clarke|work=[[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music]] Online|url=http://www.grovemusic.com}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 she moved to the United States to continue her performing career. A short, lyrical piece for viola and piano entitled ''Morpheus'', composed under the [[pseudonym]] of "Anthony Trent", was premiered at her 1918 joint recital with cellist [[May Mukle]] in New York City. Reviewers praised the "Trent", largely ignoring the works credited to Clarke premiered in the same recital.&lt;ref name="cd" /&gt; Her compositional career peaked in a brief period, beginning with the [[Viola Sonata (Rebecca Clarke)|viola sonata]] she entered in a 1919 competition sponsored by [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]], Clarke's neighbour and a [[patronage|patron]] of the arts. In a field of 72 entrants, Clarke's sonata tied for first place with a composition by [[Ernest Bloch]]. Coolidge later declared Bloch the winner. Reporters speculated that "Rebecca Clarke" was only a pseudonym for Bloch himself, or at least that it could not have been Clarke who wrote these pieces,&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; as the idea that a woman could write such a work was socially inconceivable. The sonata was well received and had its first performance at the Berkshire music festival in 1919. In 1921 Clarke again made an impressive showing in Coolidge's composition competition with her [[piano trio]], though again failed to take the prize. A 1923 [[rhapsody (music)|rhapsody]] for [[cello]] and [[piano]] followed, sponsored by Coolidge, making Clarke the only female recipient of Coolidge's patronage.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; These three works represent the height of Clarke's compositional career.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;

==Later life and marriage==
Clarke, in 1924, embarked upon a career as a solo and ensemble performer in London, after first completing a world tour in 1922–23.&lt;ref name=reich&gt;{{cite book|last=Reich|first=Nancy B|title=A Rebecca Clarke reader|year=2005|publisher=Rebecca Clarke Society|isbn=978-0-9770079-0-5|pages=10–18|editor=Curtis, Liane|chapter=Rebecca Clarke: An Uncommon Woman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 she helped form the English Ensemble, a piano quartet that included herself, [[Marjorie Hayward]], [[Kathleen Long]] and [[May Mukle]]. She also performed on several recordings in the 1920s and 1930s, and participated in [[BBC]] music broadcasts. Her compositional output greatly decreased during this period.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; However, she continued to perform, participating in the Paris Colonial Exhibition in 1931 as part of the English Ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Rebecca|title=La Semaine Anglaise at the Paris Colonial Exhibition|journal=BMS Bulletin|date=Autumn 1931|volume=New Series I|pages=7–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1927 and 1933 she was romantically involved with the British [[baritone]], [[John Goss (baritone)|John Goss]], who was eight years her junior and married at the time.&lt;ref name="id" /&gt; He had premiered several of her mature songs, two of which were dedicated to him, "June Twilight" and "The Seal Man". Her "Tiger, Tiger", finished at the time the relationship was ending, proved to be her last composition for solo voice until the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stein, Deborah|year=2005|chapter='Dare seize the fire': An introduction to the songs of Rebecca Clarke|editor=Curtis, Liane|title=A Rebecca Clarke Reader|publisher=Rebecca Clarke Society|pages=43–78|isbn=978-0-9770079-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of World War II, Clarke was in the US visiting her two brothers, and was unable to obtain a visa to return to Britain. She lived for a while with her brothers' families and then in 1942 took a position as a governess for a family in Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ammer, Christine|year=2001|title=[[Unsung: A History of Women in American Music]] |edition= 2nd|page= 167|publisher=Amadeus|isbn=1-57467-058-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She composed 10 works between 1939 and 1942, including her ''Passacaglia on an Old English Tune''.&lt;ref name="curtis-reader"/&gt; She had first met [[James Friskin]], a composer, concert pianist, and founding member of the [[Juilliard School]] faculty, and later to become her husband, when they were both students at the Royal College of Music. They renewed their friendship after a chance meeting on a Manhattan street in 1944 and married in September of that year when both were in their late 50s. According to musicologist Liane Curtis, Friskin was "a man who gave [Clarke] a sense of deep satisfaction and equilibrium."&lt;ref name="id" /&gt;

Clarke has been described by Stephen Banfield as the most distinguished British female composer of the inter-war generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Banfield, Stephen|title=Clarke, Rebecca (Thacher)|encyclopedia=The Norton/Grove Dictionary of Women Composers|publisher=W.W. Norton and Co|year=1995|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her later output was sporadic.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; She suffered from [[dysthymia]], a chronic form of [[mood disorder|depression]];&lt;ref name="woolf"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Curtis, Liane|title=When Virginia Woolf met Rebecca Clarke|journal=Newsletter of the Rebecca Clarke Society|date=Fall 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of encouragement—sometimes outright discouragement—she received for her work also made her reluctant to compose.&lt;ref name="id" /&gt; Clarke did not consider herself able to balance her personal life and the demands of composition: "I can't do it unless it's the first thing I think of every morning when I wake and the last thing I think of every night before I go to sleep." After her marriage, she stopped composing, despite the encouragement of her husband, although she continued working on arrangements until shortly before her death. She also stopped performing.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="id" /&gt;

Clarke sold the Stradivarius she had been bequeathed, and established the May Mukle prize at the Royal Academy. The prize is still awarded annually to an outstanding cellist.&lt;ref&gt;Schleifer, Martha Furman (2000). Program notes to Clarke's ''Sonata for Viola and Piano''. Hildegard Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; After her husband's death in 1967, Clarke began writing a [[memoir]], entitled ''I Had a Father Too (or the Mustard Spoon)''; it was completed in 1973 but never published. In it she describes her early life, marked by frequent beatings from her father and strained family relations which affected her perceptions of her proper place in life.&lt;ref name="id" /&gt; Clarke died in 1979 at her home in [[New York City]] at the age of 93, and was [[cremation|cremated]].&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

==Music==
[[File:Aeolian Hall program (13 Feb 1918).jpg|thumb|A 1918 program showcasing Clarke's work. Here, her duet ''Morpheus'' is credited to the pseudonym "Anthony Trent"]]
A large portion of Clarke's music features the viola, as she was a professional performer for many years. Much of her output was written for herself and the all-female chamber ensembles she played in, including the Norah Clench Quartet, the English Ensemble, and the d'Aranyi Sisters. She also toured worldwide, particularly with cellist May Mukle. Her works were strongly influenced by several trends in [[20th century classical music]]. Clarke also knew many leading composers of the day, including Bloch and Ravel, with whom her work has been compared.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;

The [[impressionist music|impressionism]] of Debussy is often mentioned in connection with Clarke's work, particularly its lush textures and modernistic [[harmony|harmonies]]. The [[Viola Sonata (Rebecca Clarke)|Viola Sonata]] (published in the same year as the Bloch and the [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]] Viola Sonata) is an example of this, with its [[pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] opening theme, thick harmonies, emotionally intense nature, and dense, [[rhythm]]ically complex texture. The Sonata remains a part of standard repertoire for the viola. ''[[Morpheus (Rebecca Clarke)|Morpheus]]'', composed a year earlier, was her first expansive work, after over a decade of songs and miniatures. The ''Rhapsody'' that Coolidge sponsored is Clarke's most ambitious work: it is roughly 23 minutes long, with complex musical ideas and ambiguous tonalities contributing to the varying moods of the piece. In contrast, "Midsummer Moon", written the following year, is a light miniature, with a flutter-like solo violin line.&lt;ref name="cd" /&gt;

In addition to her chamber music for strings, Clarke wrote many songs. Nearly all of Clarke's early pieces are for solo voice and piano. Her 1933 "Tiger, Tiger", a setting of [[William Blake|Blake]]'s poem "[[The Tyger]]", is dark and brooding, almost [[expressionism|expressionist]]. She worked on it for five years to the exclusion of other works during her tumultuous relationship with John Goss and revised it in 1972.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; Most of her songs, however, are lighter in nature. Her earliest works were [[parlour music|parlour songs]], and she went on to build up a body of work drawn primarily from classic texts by [[William Butler Yeats|Yeats]], [[John Masefield|Masefield]], and [[A.E. Housman]].&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;

During 1939 to 1942, the last prolific period near the end of her compositional career, her style became more clear and [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]], with emphasis on [[motif (music)|motivic]] elements and tonal structures, the hallmarks of [[neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. ''Dumka'' (1941), a recently published work for violin, viola, and piano, reflects the [[Eastern Europe]]an [[folk music|folk]] styles of [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] and [[Bohuslav Martinů|Martinů]].&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; The "[[Passacaglia]] on an Old English Tune", also from 1941 and premiered by Clarke herself, is based on a theme attributed to [[Thomas Tallis]] which appears throughout the work. The piece is modal in flavor, mainly in the [[Dorian mode]] but venturing into the seldom-heard [[Phrygian mode]]. The piece is dedicated to "BB", ostensibly Clarke's niece Magdalen; scholars speculate that the dedication is more likely referring to [[Benjamin Britten]], who organised a concert commemorating the death of Clarke's friend and major influence [[Frank Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Liane (1999). Program notes to "Passacaglia on an Old English Tune". Hildegard Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prelude, Allegro, and Pastorale'', also composed in 1941, is another neoclassically-influenced piece, written for clarinet and viola (originally for her brother and sister-in-law).&lt;ref name="cd" /&gt;

Clarke composed no large scale works such as symphonies. Her total output of compositions comprises 52 songs, 11 choral works, 21 chamber pieces, the Piano Trio, and the Viola Sonata.&lt;ref name="grove"/&gt; Her work was all but forgotten for a long period of time, but interest in it was revived in 1976 following a radio broadcast in celebration of her ninetieth birthday. Over half of Clarke's compositions remain unpublished and in the personal possession of her heirs, along with most of her writings.&lt;ref name="woolf" /&gt; However, in the early 2000s more of her works were printed and recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Curtis, Liane|title=A Rebecca Clarke reader|publisher=The Rebecca Clarke Society|year=2005|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of recent publications include two [[string quartet]]s and ''Morpheus'', published in 2002.&lt;ref name="cd" /&gt;

Modern reception of Clarke's work has been generally positive. A 1981 review of her Viola Sonata called it a "thoughtful, well constructed piece" from a relatively obscure composer;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: Britten. Lacrymae, Op. 48, Clarke. Viola Sonata.|journal=Gramophone|date=July 1981|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1985 review noted its "emotional intensity and use of dark tone colours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: Clarke. Viola Sonata.|journal=Gramophone|date=July 1985|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Achenbach, in his review of a [[Helen Callus]] recording of several Clarke works, referred to ''Morpheus'' as "striking" and "languorous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Achenbach|first=Andrew|title=Review: A Portrait of the Viola|journal=Gramophone|date=February 2003|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurence Vittes noted that Clarke's "Lullaby" was "exceedingly sweet and tender".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vittes|first=Laurence|title=Viola View|journal=Gramophone|date=November 2005|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1987 review concluded that "it seems astonishing that such splendidly written and deeply moving music should have lain in obscurity all these years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: Clarke. Piano Trio.|journal=Gramophone|date=March 1987|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Viola Sonata was the subject of BBC Radio 3's Building a Library survey on 17 October 2015. The top recommendation, chosen by Helen Wallace, was by Tabea Zimmermann (viola) and Kirill Gerstein (piano). In 2017 BBC Radio 3 devoted five hours to her music as ''Composer of the Week.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08rg35f|title=The Famous Viola Sonata, Rebecca Clarke (1886-1979), Composer of the Week - BBC Radio 3|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebecca Clarke Society==
The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in September 2000 to promote performance, scholarship, and awareness of the works of Rebecca Clarke. Founded by [[musicologist]]s Liane Curtis and [[Jessie Ann Owens]] and based in the Women's Studies Research Center at [[Brandeis University]], the Society has promoted recording and scholarship of Clarke's work, including several world premiere performances, recordings of unpublished material, and numerous journal publications.&lt;ref name="rcs"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Rebecca Clarke Society|url=http://www.rebeccaclarke.org/aboutRCS.html|publisher=Rebecca Clarke Society|accessdate=1 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923132358/http://www.rebeccaclarke.org/aboutRCS.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society made available previously unpublished compositions from Clarke's estate. "Binnorie", a twelve-minute song based on [[Celt]]ic folklore, was discovered in 1997, and not premiered until 2001. Over 25 previously unknown works have been published since the establishment of the Society. Several of Clarke's chamber works, including the expansive ''Rhapsody'' for cello and piano, and ''Cortège'', her only piano work, were first recorded in 2000 on the Dutton label, using material from the Clarke estate. In 2002, the Society organised and sponsored the world premieres of the 1907 and 1909 violin sonatas.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite web|title=News and Events|url=http://www.rebeccaclarke.org/news.html|publisher=Rebecca Clarke Society|accessdate=1 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109012123/http://www.rebeccaclarke.org/news.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of the Rebecca Clarke Society, Liane Curtis, is the editor of ''A Rebecca Clarke Reader'', originally published by Indiana University Press in 2004. The book was withdrawn from circulation by the publisher following complaints from the current manager of Clarke's estate about the quotation of unpublished examples from Clarke's writings.&lt;ref name="byrne"&gt;{{cite news|author=Byrne, Richard|title=Silent Treatment|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Silent-Treatment/36247|accessdate=1 December 2010|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=2004-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Reader'' has since been reissued by the Rebecca Clarke Society itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rebeccaclarke.org/the-rebecca-clarke-reader-2/ |title=A Rebecca Clarke Reader |publisher=Rebecca Clarke Society |date= |accessdate=19 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robin''' is the name of several fictional [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character was originally created by [[Bob Kane]], [[Bill Finger]], and [[Jerry Robinson]], to serve as a junior counterpart to the superhero [[Batman]]. The character's first incarnation, '''[[Dick Grayson]]''', debuted in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #38 (April 1940). Conceived as a way to attract young readership, Robin garnered overwhelmingly positive critical reception, doubling the sales of the Batman titles.&lt;ref name="Batman: The Complete History"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Daniels | first=Les | authorlink=Les Daniels | title=Batman: The Complete History | publisher=[[Chronicle Books]] | year=2004 | page=37 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73wknu2cVIkC | isbn=0-8118-4232-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early adventures of Robin included ''[[Star Spangled Comics]]'' #65–130 (1947–1952), which was the character's first solo feature. Robin made regular appearances in Batman related comic books and other DC Comics publications from 1940 through the early 1980s until the character set aside the Robin identity and became the independent superhero [[Nightwing]]. The team of Batman and Robin has commonly been referred to as the ''Caped Crusaders'' or ''Dynamic Duo''.

The character's second incarnation '''[[Jason Todd]]''' first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #357 (1983). This Robin made regular appearances in Batman related comic books until 1988, when the character was murdered by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] in the storyline "[[Batman: A Death in the Family|A Death in the Family]]" (1989). Jason would later find himself alive after a reality changing incident, eventually becoming the [[Red Hood (comics)#Jason Todd|Red Hood]]. The premiere ''Robin'' limited series was published in 1991 which featured the character's third incarnation '''[[Tim Drake]]''' training to earn the role of Batman's vigilante partner. Following two successful sequels, the monthly ''Robin'' ongoing series began in 1993 and ended in early 2009, which also helped his transition from sidekick to a superhero in his own right. In 2004 storylines, established DC Comics character '''[[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]]''' became the fourth Robin for a short duration before the role reverted to Tim Drake. '''[[Damian Wayne]]''' succeeds Drake as Robin in the 2009 story arc "[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|Battle for the Cowl]]".

Following the 2011 continuity [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] "[[the New 52]]", Tim Drake was revised as having assumed the title [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]], and Jason Todd, operating as the [[Red Hood]], was slowly repairing his relationship with Batman. Dick Grayson resumed his role as [[Nightwing]] and Stephanie Brown was introduced anew under her previous moniker Spoiler in the pages of ''[[Batman Eternal]]'' (2014). The 2016 [[DC Rebirth]] continuity relaunch starts off with Damian Wayne as Robin, Tim Drake as Red Robin, Jason Todd as Red Hood, and Dick Grayson as Nightwing. Robins have also been featured throughout stories set in parallel worlds, owing to DC Comics' longstanding "[[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]" concept. For example, in the original [[Earth-Two]], Dick Grayson never adopted the name Nightwing, and continues operating as Robin into adulthood. In the New 52's "Earth-2" continuity, Robin is [[Huntress (comics)|Helena Wayne]], daughter of  [[Batman]] and [[Catwoman]], who was stranded on the Earth of the main continuity and takes the name [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]].&lt;ref&gt;Motes, Jason (September 5, 2012).[http://www.sciencefiction.com/2012/09/05/comic-book-review-worlds-finest-huntress-and-powergirl-0/ "Comic Book Review: 'World's Finest – Huntress and Powergirl' #0"].

==Fictional character biography==
About a year after [[Batman]]'s debut, Batman creators [[Bob Kane]] and [[Bill Finger]] introduced Robin the Boy Wonder in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #38 (1940). The name "Robin the Boy Wonder" and the medieval look of the original costume were inspired by ''[[Robin Hood|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]''. Robinson noted he "came up with Robin Hood because ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' were boyhood favorites of mine. I had been given a Robin Hood book illustrated by [[N. C. Wyeth]]&amp;nbsp;... and that's what I quickly sketched out when I suggested the name Robin Hood, which they seemed to like, and then showed them the costume. And if you look at it, it's Wyeth's costume, from my memory, because I didn't have the book to look at."&lt;ref&gt;''The Comics Journal'' #271&lt;/ref&gt; (Some later accounts of Robin's origin have stated that the name comes from the [[American robin]] bird, not from [[Robin Hood]],&lt;ref&gt;

Sometimes both sources are credited, as in [[Len Wein]]'s ''[[The Untold Legend of the Batman]]''.) Although Robin is best known as Batman's sidekick, the Robins have also been members of the superhero group the [[Teen Titans]]—with the original Robin, [[Dick Grayson]], as a founding member and the group's leader and with [[Tim Drake]] as the team leader {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}}.

In Batman stories, the character of Robin was intended to be Batman's [[Doctor Watson|Watson]]: Bill Finger, writer for many early Batman adventures, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Robin was an outgrowth of a conversation I had with [[Bob Kane|Bob]]. As I said, Batman was a combination of [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]]. Holmes had his [[Doctor Watson|Watson]]. The thing that bothered me was that Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking. I found that as I went along Batman needed a Watson to talk to. That's how Robin came to be. Bob called me over and said he was going to put a boy in the strip to identify with Batman. I thought it was a great idea."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following fictional characters have assumed the Robin role at various times in the main {{DC Universe}} [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]]:

===Dick Grayson===
[[File:Robin-Grayson-Batman682.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dick Grayson]] as Robin in ''Batman'' #682 (January 2009). Art by Lee Garbett.]]
{{main|Dick Grayson}}
In the comics, Dick Grayson was an 8-year-old [[acrobatics|acrobat]] and the youngest of a family act called the "Flying Graysons". A gangster named [[Tony Zucco|Boss Zucco]], loosely based on actor [[Edward G. Robinson]]'s ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' character, had been extorting money from the circus and killed Grayson's parents, John and Mary, by sabotaging their [[trapeze]] equipment as a warning against defiance. Batman investigated the crime and, as his alter ego billionaire Bruce Wayne, had Dick put under his custody as a legal ward. Together they investigated Zucco and collected the evidence needed to bring him to justice. From his debut appearance in 1940 through 1969, Robin was known as the Boy Wonder. Batman creates a costume for Dick, consisting of a red tunic, yellow cape, green gloves, green boots, green spandex briefs, and a utility belt. As he grew older, graduated from high school, and enrolled in [[Hudson University (comics)|Hudson University]], Robin continued his career as the Teen Wonder, from 1970 into the early 1980s.

The character was rediscovered by a new generation of fans during the 1980s because of the success of ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'', in which he left Batman's shadow entirely to assume the identity of [[Nightwing]]. He aids Batman throughout the later storyline regarding the several conflicts with Jason Todd until he makes his final return as the "Red Hood". Grayson temporarily took over as Batman (while Wayne was traveling through time), using the aid of Damian Wayne, making his newish appearance as "Robin", to defeat and imprison Todd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Phillips | first=Dan | url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/986/986031p1.html | title=Grant Morrison's New Batman and Robin | work=[[IGN]] | date=May 22, 2009 | accessdate=September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/961/961488p1.html | last=George | first=Richard | title=Grant Morrison Discusses Batman and Robin | work=IGN | date=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Bruce Wayne's return, Grayson went back to being Nightwing.

===Jason Todd===
{{main|Jason Todd}}
{{refimprove|date=August 2012}}

[[File:Batman 428.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Batman'' #428 (December 1988) from the storyline ''[[Batman: A Death in the Family|A Death in the Family]]''. Art by Mike Mignola.]]
DC was initially hesitant{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} to turn Grayson into [[Nightwing]] and to replace him with a new Robin. To minimize the change, they made the new Robin, Jason Peter Todd, who first appeared in ''Batman'' #357 (1983), similar to a young Grayson. Like Dick Grayson, Jason Todd was the son of circus acrobats murdered by a criminal (this time the Batman adversary [[Killer Croc]]), and then adopted by Bruce Wayne. In this incarnation, he was originally red-haired and unfailingly cheerful, and wore his circus costume to fight crime until Dick Grayson presented him with a Robin suit of his own. At that point, he dyed his hair black.

After the mini-series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', much of the [[DC Universe|DC Comics continuity]] was redone. Dick Grayson's origin, years with Batman, and growth into Nightwing remained mostly unchanged; but Todd's character was completely revised. He was now a black-haired street orphan who first encountered Batman when he attempted to steal tires from the [[Batmobile]]. Batman saw to it that he was placed in a school for troubled youths. Weeks later, after Dick Grayson became Nightwing and Todd proved his crime-fighting worth by helping Batman catch a gang of robbers, Batman offered Todd the position as Robin.

Believing that readers never truly bonded with Todd, DC Comics made the controversial decision in 1988 to poll readers using a [[1-900]] number as to whether or not Todd should be killed. The event received more attention in the mainstream media than any other comic book event before it.  Readers voted "yes" by a small margin (5,343 to 5,271) and Todd was subsequently murdered by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] in the storyline, ''[[Batman: A Death in the Family|A Death in the Family]]'', in which the psychopath beat the youngster severely with a crowbar, and left him to die in a warehouse rigged with a bomb.

Jason Todd later returned as the new [[Red Hood]] (the original alias of the Joker) when he was brought back to life due to reality being altered.  After the continuity changes following [[the New 52]] DC Comics relaunch, Jason becomes a leader of the Outlaws, a superhero team that includes [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]] who had spent years with Grayson in the Titans.

===Tim Drake===
{{main|Tim Drake}}
[[File:Robin (Tim Drake).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Tim Drake]] in ''[[Supergirl (comic book)|Supergirl]]'' vol. 5, #2 (November 2005). Art by [[Ian Churchill]].]]
DC Comics was left uncertain about readers' decision to have Jason Todd killed, wondering if readers preferred Batman as a lone vigilante, disliked Todd specifically, or just wanted to see if DC would actually kill off the character. In addition, the [[1989 in film|1989]] ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' film did not feature Robin, giving DC a reason to keep him out of the comic book series for marketing purposes. Regardless, Batman editor [[Dennis O'Neil|Denny O'Neil]] introduced a new Robin. The third Robin, Timothy Drake, first appeared in a flashback in ''Batman'' #436 (1989).

In the comics, Tim Drake was a young boy who had followed the adventures of Batman and Robin ever since witnessing the murder of the Flying Graysons. This served to connect Drake to Grayson, establishing a link that DC hoped would help readers accept this new Robin. Drake surmised their secret identities with his amateur but instinctive detective skills and followed their careers closely. Tim stated on numerous occasions that he wishes to become "The World's Greatest Detective", a title currently belonging to the Dark Knight. Batman himself stated that one day Drake will surpass him as a detective. Despite his combat skills not being the match of Grayson's (although there are some similarities, in that they are far superior to Todd's when he was Robin), his detective skills more than make up for this. In addition, Batman supplied him with a new armored costume.

Tim Drake's first Robin costume had a red torso, yellow stitching and belt, black boots, and green short sleeves, gloves, pants, and domino mask. He wore a cape that was black on the outside and yellow on the inside. This costume had an armored tunic and [[gorget]], an emergency "R" [[shuriken]] on his chest in addition to the traditional [[batarang]]s and a collapsible bo staff as his primary weapon, which Tim Drake continues to use as the superhero [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]].

The character was introduced as a happy medium between the first two Robins in that, from the readers' point of view, he is neither overly well behaved like Dick Grayson nor overly impudent like Jason Todd.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Tim Drake is the first Robin to have his own comic book series, where he fought crime on his own. Tim Drake, as Robin, co-founded the superhero team [[Young Justice]] in the absence of the [[Teen Titans]] of Dick Grayson's generation, but would then later re-form the Teen Titans after Young Justice disbanded following a massive ''sidekick crossover'' during which Donna Troy was killed. Tim served as leader of this version of the Titans until 2009, at which point he quit due to the events of ''[[Batman R.I.P]].''

Following ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' and ''52'', Tim Drake modified his costume to favor a mostly red and black color scheme in tribute to his best friend, [[Superboy (Kon-El)]], who died fighting Earth-Prime [[Superman-Prime|Superboy]]. This Robin costume had a red torso, long sleeves, and pants. It also included black gloves and boots, yellow stitching and belt, and a black and yellow cape. Tim Drake continued the motif of a red and black costume when he assumed the role of Red Robin before and during the events of [[the New 52]].

Tim Drake assumes the identity of Red Robin after Batman's disappearance following the events of ''[[Final Crisis]]'' and "[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|Battle for the Cowl]]" and Damian Wayne becoming Grayson's Robin. Following 2011's continuity changes resulting from [[the New 52]] DC Comics relaunch, history was altered such that Tim Drake never took up the Robin mantle after Jason Todd's death, feeling that it would be inappropriate. Instead, he served as Batman's sidekick under the name of [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]].

===Stephanie Brown===
[[File:Stephanie-Brown-Batgirl-53.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Stephanie Brown on the cover of ''Batgirl'' #53 (August 2004). Art by James Jean.]]
{{main|Stephanie Brown (comics)}}
Stephanie Brown, [[Tim Drake]]'s girlfriend and the costumed adventurer previously known as the Spoiler, volunteered for the role of Robin upon Tim's resignation. Batman fired the Girl Wonder for not obeying his orders to the letter on two separate occasions. Stephanie then stole one of Batman's incomplete plans to control Gotham crime and executed it. Trying to prove her worthiness, Brown inadvertently set off a gang war on the streets of Gotham. While trying to help end the war, Brown was captured and tortured by the lunatic crime boss [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]. She managed to escape but apparently died shortly afterwards due to the severity of her injuries. Tim Drake keeps a memorial for her in his cave hideout underneath [[Titans Tower]] in [[San Francisco]]. She appeared alive and stalking Tim, after his return from traveling around the globe with his mentor.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin'' (vol. 2) #172&lt;/ref&gt; It turned out that [[Dr. Leslie Thompkins]] had faked Stephanie's death in an effort to protect her.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin'' (vol. 2) #174&lt;/ref&gt; For years she operated on and off as the Spoiler, but was then recruited as [[Barbara Gordon]]'s replacement as Batgirl. She had her own series as well as making appearances throughout various Batman and Batman spin-off series.  Her time as Spoiler, Robin, and Batgirl was retconned to have never occurred after the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, with her being reintroduced having just become Spoiler in ''[[Batman Eternal]]''.

===Damian Wayne===
{{main|Damian Wayne}}
Damian Wayne was the child of [[Bruce Wayne (Batman)|Bruce Wayne]] and [[Talia al Ghul]], thus the grandson of the [[Immortality|immortal]] [[Ra's al Ghul]]. Batman was unaware of his son's existence for years until Talia left Damian in his care. Damian was violent and lacking in discipline and morality, and was trained by the [[League of Assassins]]. Learning to kill at a young age, Damian's murderous behavior created a troubled relationship with his father, who vowed never to take a life.

[[File:Damian-Wayne-BRv25.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Damian Wayne in ''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2, #5 (March 2012). Art by Patrick Gleason.]]
Originally conceived to become a host for his maternal grandfather's soul as well as a pawn against the Dark Knight, Batman saved his child from this fate which forced Ra's to inhabit his own son's body, and thus, Damian was affectionate to his father.  After Batman's apparent death during ''[[Final Crisis]],'' Talia left her son under [[Dick Grayson]] and [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s care and Damian was deeply affected by his father's absence. In the first issue of "Battle for the Cowl", Damian was driving the Batmobile and was attacked by [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Killer Croc]]. Damian was rescued by [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] who then tries to escape but was shot down by Black Mask's men. Nightwing tried to fight the thugs, but the thugs were shot by Jason Todd. After a fight between Nightwing and Todd, Todd eventually shot Damian in the chest. In the final issue of the series, Alfred made Damian into Robin. Damian's first task as Robin was to rescue Tim. After "Battle for the Cowl", Grayson adopted the mantle of Batman, and instead of having Tim (who he viewed as an equal, rather than a protégé) remain as Robin, he gave the role to Damian, who he felt needed the training that his father would have given him.

Following ''[[Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne]]'' and  ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' events, Bruce Wayne returned to his role as Batman while Dick resumed as Nightwing. As of the "New 52", Damian continued to work with his father, but temporarily gave up being Robin (as his mother put a price on his head), and went under the identity of Red Bird. Damian met his end at the hands of Heretic, an aged-clone of Damian working for [[Leviathan (DC Comics)|Leviathan]], bravely giving up his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: Incorporated'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his status as deceased, Damian starred in his own mini-series, ''Damian: Son of Batman,'' written and drawn by [[Andy Kubert]], set in a future where Damian is on the path to become Batman after his father fell victim to a trap set by the Joker.  Batman eventually started a difficult quest to resurrect him, returning Damian to life with [[Darkseid]]'s Chaos Shard.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #37 (December 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
{{further|Alternative versions of Robin}}

===Bruce Wayne===
{{see also|Batman}}
A Batman story from the 1950s featured the young Bruce Wayne assuming the identity of Robin, complete with the original costume, in order to learn the basics of detective work from a famous [[detective]] named Harvey Harris. The purpose of the secret identity was to prevent Harris from learning Wayne's true motivation for approaching him, which could have led to the detective attempting to discourage the boy from pursuing his obsession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | writer = [[Edmond Hamilton]] | penciller = [[Dick Sprang]] | inker = [[Charles Paris]] | story = "When Batman Was Robin" | title = ''[[Detective Comics]]'' | issue = 226 | date = December 1955| publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this story remained canonical through the most of the 1980s (it was revisited in the ''[[Untold Legend of the Batman]]'' miniseries in 1980), it was revised [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|post-Crisis]] to edit out any reference to Bruce Wayne having ever called himself "Robin" or worn any costume before he finally donned his Batman costume as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | writer = [[Mark Waid]] | cowriters = [[Brian Augustyn]] | penciller = [[Val Semeiks]] | inker = [[Michael Bair]] | story = "Blood Secrets" | title = ''Detective Comics Annual'' | issue = 2 | date = 1989 | publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] later worked this aspect into his non-canonical story ''[[Superman &amp; Batman: Generations]]''.

Post-Crisis, there was one instance in continuity when Bruce Wayne adopted the Robin persona. In ''Batboy &amp; Robin'', a tie-in special to the DC Comics storyline ''Sins of Youth'', Bruce and Tim Drake, the third Robin, had their ages magically switched. In an effort to keep up the illusion of Batman, Bruce had Tim adopt the Batman identity while he is forced to be Robin.

===Earth-Two Robin, before ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''===
[[File:Robin Earth 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Pre-Crisis Earth-Two Robin]]
{{Main|Robin (Earth-Two)}}
{{see also|Crisis on Infinite Earths}}

On [[Earth-Two]], home of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] version of DC's superheroes, Dick Grayson continued to be Robin even as an adult, having no successors, and even after [[Batman#Golden Age version|Batman]]'s death. His allies as a boy included the [[All-Star Squadron]] along with [[Batwoman]] and [[Flamebird]].

By the 1960s, Grayson had become an adult, and was a lawyer and the ambassador to [[South Africa]]. He adopted a more Batman-like costume, but still fought crime as Robin. This adult version of Dick Grayson debuted in ''Justice League of America'' #55, where he also became a member of the [[Justice Society of America]]. Although in semi-retirement for a time, he was called back to active duty when he rejoined the Justice Society during the period when he, [[Power Girl]] and [[Star-Spangled Kid]], assisted them as The Super Squad.

He appeared to have died during the 1985 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', in which the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]] was reduced to one Universe, and this version of Grayson, as well as the Earth-Two Batman, were deemed never to have existed. The Earth-2 concept was revived and reimagined twice subsequently, following the comic books ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' (2006–7) and ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' (2011).

===The Toy Wonder===
{{see also|DC One Million}}
In the ''DC One Million'' storyline, members of the [[Justice League of America]] encounter a variety of heroes from the future, including an 853rd-century Batman who patrols the prison planet [[Pluto]]. This version of Batman is accompanied by a robotic Robin who contains a transcribed copy of his own personality from before his parents were murdered by Plutonian criminals.

This Robin (who calls himself "the Toy Wonder") is a member of the [[Young Justice|Justice Legion T]] in addition to serving as a deliberate counterbalance to Batman's dark personality.
===Elseworlds versions===
{{see also|Alternative versions of Robin#Elseworlds}}
''Elseworlds'' versions of DC characters are ones that exist in alternate timelines or realities that take place in entirely self-contained continuities. In ''Elseworlds'' Robin has been a German immigrant during WWII named Richart Graustark, Bruce Wayne Jr (the son of Julia Madison and Bruce Wayne), a genetically enhanced ape named Rodney, a samurai named Tengu, a pirate's cabin boy, a girl traveling via space ship to a far off colonial planet, Bruce Wayne's nephew Thomas Wayne III, MI-6 agent Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne's sister during the Reign of Terror in France, and a Native American named Red Bird.

=== Carrie Kelley ===
{{Main|Carrie Kelley}}

In [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s non-canonical ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', the role of Robin is filled by [[Carrie Kelley]], a thirteen-year-old girl. She becomes Robin, and is accepted by the Batman after she saves his life. Unlike the previous Robins, Carrie is not an orphan, but she appears to have rather neglectful parents who are never actually depicted (one of them mutters "Didn't we have a kid?" while their daughter is watching the fierce battle between Batman and the Mutants). It is hinted through their dialogue that they were once activists and possibly [[hippies]] during the 1960s, but have since become apathetic stoners. She was the first female Robin and the first Robin with living parents. In the sequel, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', 2001, Carrie dons the identity of '''Catgirl''' but still works as Batman's second-in-command.

She was also featured in an episode of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' entitled "Legends of the Dark Knight". She then appeared in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''{{'s}} episode entitled "Batman Dies At Dawn!" along with Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake, Stephanie Brown, and Damian Wayne. Kelley joined the New 52 DC universe in ''Batman and Robin'' #19, in a story titled ''Batman and Red Robin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/05/the-dark-knight-returns-carrie-kelley-is-back|title=The Dark Knight Returns' Carrie Kelley is Back|last=Esposito|first=Joey|date=April 5, 2013|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Talon===
Crime Syndicate version of Robin on Earth-3, associate of Owlman. Talon refers to Owlman as his father, whether he is the biological son of Thomas Wayne II or an alternate version of Jason Todd or Tim Drake is unknown. Talon first appeared in ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #32 (March 2006).

===''52'' Multiverse===
In the final issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "[[Earth-Two|Earth-2]]". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-2, including Robin among other Justice Society of America characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | title=[[52 (comics)|52]] | issue=52 | date=May 2, 2007 | publisher=DC Comics | page=13 | panel=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on comments by [[Grant Morrison]], this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900 | title=The ''52'' Exit Interviews: Grant Morrison | accessdate=May 12, 2007 | last=Brady | first=Matt | date=May 8, 2007 | work=[[Newsarama]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl= | archivedate=May 10, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the ''Justice Society of America'' Annual #1, published in the summer of 2008, [[Hector Hall|Silver Scarab]] explains that the events of the Crisis are remembered by the people of this Earth-2, and from ''their'' perspective, Earth-2 seemed to be the only Earth to have survived the Crisis, raising theories as to whether or not Earth-2 was really destroyed, or was perhaps replaced by a new Earth-2.  Indeed, in ''Justice Society of America'' #20, published in December 2008, Starman explains that during the re-expansion of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]], Earth-2 was reborn "along with everyone on it", including Robin.

Following ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' (2011) and [[The New 52]] reboot, this Earth is replaced by another reimagining of Earth 2, one where Batman's daughter Helena Wayne served as Robin until an incident five years prior to the relaunch sent her to DC's primary continuity, Earth-0, where she works as Huntress. The 2014 series ''Earth 2: World's End'' establishes that Dick Grayson never served as Robin on this Earth, and was instead a reporter who married Barbara Gordon and had a son. During [[Darkseid]]'s invasion of Earth 2, Barbara is killed, and Dick is trained in how to fight by [[Wildcat (comics)|Ted Grant]] and goes on a mission to find his missing son.

==''Robin'' monthlies==
The first ''Robin'' miniseries was printed in 1992 following Tim Drake's debut as Robin. The series centered around Tim's continued training and set up villains linked to the character. It was followed up by another series ''Robin II: Joker's Wild'' which pitted Tim against his predecessor's murderer [[Joker (character)|the Joker]]. With Batman out of town, it was up to Tim and Alfred to end the Joker's latest crime spree. A final miniseries, ''Robin III: Cry of Huntress'' wrapped up the trilogy, teaming Tim with the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]]. In 1993, the success of the three miniseries led to the ongoing ''Robin'' series which ran 183 issues until 2009. The title was replaced by a ''Batman and Robin'' series following the ''Battle for the Cowl'' mini-series, as well as an ongoing ''Red Robin'' monthly which continues the story of Tim Drake.

The ongoing ''Robin'' series has taken part in a number of crossovers with other comics, especially ''Batman'' and related series. These include:
* ''Robin'' #7: [[Batman: Knightfall#"The Search"|Knightquest: The Search]]
* ''Robin'' #8: [[Batman: Knightfall#"KnightsEnd"|KnightsEnd]]
* ''Robin'' #9: [[Batman: Knightfall#"KnightsEnd: Aftermath"|KnightsEnd: Aftermath]]

* ''Robin'' #32–33: [[Batman: Legacy]]

* ''Robin'' #168–169: [[The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul]]
* ''Robin'' #175–176: [[Batman R.I.P.]]

In addition, two Robin related series launched in June 2015: ''[[We Are Robin (comic book)|We Are Robin]]'', featuring writer [[Lee Bermejo]] and artists [[Rob Haynes]] and [[Khary Randolph]], and detailing multiple teenagers in Gotham who take up the mantle of Robin and ''Robin, Son of Batman'', written and drawn by [[Patrick Gleason (artist)|Patrick Gleason]], showing the individual adventures of Damian Wayne.

==Reception==
According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' in 2008, Robin is one of the "greatest sidekicks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Schott | first=Ben | title=Schott's Miscellany Calendar 2009 | journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | location=New York | publisher=Workman Publishing | date=March 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayals==
{{see also|Robin in other media}}
Robin (Dick Grayson) was portrayed by [[Douglas Croft]] and [[Johnny Duncan (actor)|Johnny Duncan]], respectively, in the [[Batman (serial)|1943]] and [[Batman and Robin (serial)|1949]] fifteen chapter ''Batman'' serials. [[Burt Ward]] played him in the 1966–1968 ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series and the [[Batman (1966 film)|related 1966 film]]. In the live-action movies ''[[Batman Forever]]'' and ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'', he was played by [[Chris O'Donnell]]. [[Michael Cera]] voiced the character in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''.

The Dick Grayson version of Robin also appears in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Loren Lester]]. Grayson is replaced by Tim Drake, played by [[Mathew Valencia]], in the subsequent series ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.

The animated series ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' features Robin (voiced by [[Scott Menville]]) as the leader of a team of young heroes; it is hinted in several episodes that this Robin is Dick Grayson. In the season two episode  "Fractured", a version of Bat-Mite is introduced who claims to be Robin's "DNA buddy" (genetic twin).  Bat-Mite gives his name as Nosyarg Kcid ("Dick Grayson" spelled backwards). In another episode, Raven reads Robin's mind and sees a man and a woman falling from a trapeze (an event known only to have happened to Grayson and not to any other Robin). In another episode, Starfire travels to the future and discovers that Robin has taken the identity of Nightwing. Menville reprises his role as Robin in ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]''.

Robin is also seen in the 1987 [[Zeller's]] commercial, which features the infamous catchphrase, "Well said, Robin!".

Robin is voiced by Jesse McCartney in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]''.

Robin is portrayed by Nick Lang in ''[[Holy Musical B@man!]]''. His portrayal is based mainly on Burt Ward's Dick Grayson.

'''Roger Keith Ver''' (born January 27, 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VLQ2-XTQ|title=California Birth Index of Roger Keith Ver|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an early investor in [[bitcoin]]-related startups.

===Cryptocurrency===
Ver began investing in bitcoin in early 2011.&lt;ref name="mbj"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/02/meet-bitcoin-jesus-a-virtual-currency-millionaire.html |title=Meet 'Bitcoin Jesus,' a virtual currency millionaire |author=Ansuya Harjani |accessdate=25 December 2016 |date=2 December 2013 |work=CNBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first investment he made was for [[Charlie Shrem]]’s Bitinstant.&lt;ref name="bbbs"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://observer.com/2011/12/brooklyn-based-bitcoin-startup-bitinstant-raises-seed-round/ |title=Brooklyn-Based Bitcoin Startup BitInstant Raises Seed Round |author=Adrianne Jeffries |accessdate=28 December 2016 |date=13 December 2011 |work=Observer |publisher=Observer Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ver's investment allowed the company to hire a designer and another programmer.&lt;ref name="meetarr"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/charlie-shrem-arrested-bitcoin-ceo-2014-1 |title=Meet The 'Bitcoin Millionaire' Arrested For Allegedly Helping Silk Road Launder $US1 Million |author=Kyle Russell |accessdate=28 December 2016 |date=29 January 2014 |work=Business Insider Australia |publisher=Allure Media }}&lt;/ref&gt; He invested over a million dollars into new bitcoin related [[Startup company|startups]] including [[Ripple (payment protocol)|Ripple]], [[Blockchain.info]], Bitpay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lunden|first1=Ingrid|title=With PayPal-Like Ambitions For Bitcoin, BitPay Raises $2M Led By Founders Fund|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/16/an-offer-you-cant-refuse-bitcoin-startup-bitpay-raises-2m-led-by-founders-fund-the-vc-run-by-the-paypal-mafia/|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kraken (bitcoin exchange)|Kraken]].&lt;ref name="bjc"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-15/-bitcoin-jesus-calls-rich-to-tax-free-tropical-paradise |title=‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Calls Rich to Tax-Free Tropical Paradise |author=Jason Clenfield |author2=Pavel Alpeyev |accessdate=25 December 2016 |date=16 June 2014 |work=Bloomberg }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Ver's company Memorydealers was the first to accept bitcoin as payment.&lt;ref name="hbbthbom"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/12/bitcoin_honey/ |title=How Bitcoin Became the Honey Badger of Money |author=Robert McMillan |accessdate=25 January 2017 |date=19 December 2013 |work=Wired |publisher=Conde Nast }}&lt;/ref&gt; His early advocacy for bitcoin earned him the moniker of Bitcoin Jesus.&lt;ref name="mbj"/&gt;

In 2012, he created bitcoinstore.com with hundreds of thousands of items available for purchase with bitcoin. In May 2014, an old email account used by Ver was hacked and used in a failed attempt to ransom bitcoin.&lt;ref name="hrvgh"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.coindesk.com/how-roger-ver-hacked-what-he-did-stop-it/ |title=How Roger Ver Got Hacked, and What He Did to Stop it |author=Jon Southurst |accessdate=25 December 2016 |date=24 May 2014 |work=CoinDesk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ver gained control of bitcoin.com in April 2014.

In 2012, Ver was organising bitcoin [[Meeting|meetups]] in [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]].&lt;ref name="taoc"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Age of Cryptocurrency: How Bitcoin and Digital Money Are Challenging the Global Economic Order |last=Vigna |first=Paul |author2=Michael J.

Ver wants bitcoin to rival major fiat currencies.

He is one of the main proponents of a larger block size. He supported the development of [[Bitcoin XT]] as a hard fork method towards an increase. Ver and his high school friend Jesse Powell attempted to re-establish the Mt Gox exchange during the June 2011 bitcoin price crash.&lt;ref name="taoc"/&gt;

== Opinions ==
Ver writes opinion pieces for bitcoin-related websites and online forums.  He has advocated for the widespread [[adoption (software implementation)|adoption]] of bitcoin software [[client (computing)|client]] that allows for an increase in the [[block chain (database)|block chain]] block size limit.  Ver strongly disagrees with the block size limit because it is contrary to his preferred strategy of rapid and widespread growth of bitcoin. Ver wants the use of this currency to be so widespread that an alternative cannot supplant bitcoin's [[first-mover advantage]].

During an interview with CNBC in December 2017 he expressed the opinion that insider trading is not a crime - "I think insider trading is a non-crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ccn.com/insider-trading-non-crime-roger-ver-bites-back-gdax-re-opens-bitcoin-cash-trading/|title=‘Insider Trading Is a Non-Crime’: Roger Ver Bites Back as GDAX Re-Opens Bitcoin Cash Trading|date=2017-12-23|work=CCN|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
He believes that the [[war|violent interventions]] of governments should be replaced by voluntary human interactions in the [[free market]].  Ver identifies with the political philosophy of [[individualism]].

===Donations===
In 2012, Ver helped the establishment of the [[Bitcoin Foundation]] with a large donation.{{Citation needed|reason=This needs an RS|date=December 2017}}  In late 2013, Ver donated more than $1&amp;nbsp;million worth of bitcoin to the [[Foundation for Economic Education]].&lt;ref name="mbj"/&gt;   Ver has donated more than $20K to [[antiwar.com]].&lt;ref name="bittra"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blockchain.info/tx/f6cc6c3041a1928153f6c678eeeb2ad62a09edc8bcb957f9ec58f77016b6dc95 |title=Bitcoin Transaction |date=20 January 2015 |work=Bitcoin blockchain |publisher=Blockchain.info |accessdate=28 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roman Evsey Glazman''' (June 26, 1948 – April 24, 2006) was a [[Russian American]] [[physicist]] and [[oceanographer]].

==Early life and education==
Roman E. Glazman was born in [[St. Petersburg]], Russia, on June 26, 1948&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/news/10.1063/PT.4.2329|title=Roman Glazman|work=Physics Today|date=April 2006|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a secular Jewish family.  He became a [[citizen]] of the United States on October 28, 1985 and completed his PhD in Ocean Engineering at the [[University Of Rhode Island]] in 1985.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==Career==
Glazman's scientific research was the study of ocean and atmosphere. He began working at [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in La Cañada Flintridge and Pasadena, California.

Glazman published more than 40 works in Oceanography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Library of Oceanography | url=http://www.libraryofOceanography.com }} works by Roman E. Glazman and co-authors at Library of Oceanography&lt;/ref&gt; in scientific journals and completed over 60 research studies presenting at International Scientific Conferences, including OCEANS Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Experiments on Sea Level Measurements Using S-Band Interferometric Techniques, 1981|author=Roman E. Glazman|url=http://www.romanglazman.com/papers.php?myYear=1981&amp;pgnum=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Geoscience and Remote Sensing International Symposium ([[IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society|IGARSS]]), [[Compromise of 1877|Wormley Conference]], [[American Geophysical Union|American Geophysical Union Conference]] (AGU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Internal Gravity Waves as a Factor Of Large Scale Transport|url=http://abstractsearch.agu.org/meetings/2002/OS/OS51D-10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;,  International Association for Physical Sciences of the Ocean, [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fluctuations of SST and CHL-A Concentration Caused by Baroclinic Inertia-Gravity Waves|url=http://www.iugg.org/assemblies/1999birmingham/1999abstracts.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Glazman conducted exploratory expeditions in the [[Bering Sea]] and the [[North Pacific Ocean]] off the coast of [[Kamchatka]] and [[Japan]], the [[Arctic]], as well as the [[Barents Sea]] off the coast of [[Finland]].  He took measurements of the depths and [[salinity]] of oceans, of the wind forces, pressures and surface temperatures, by experimentation equipped with vessel technology available in the 1970s.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The topics in which Glazman made contributions include wave dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Wave Regime Rossby Solitons|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20060031290&amp;hterms=Equatorial+wave+regime+Rossby+solitons&amp;qs=N%3D0%26Ntk%3DAll%26Ntt%3DEquatorial%2520wave%2520regime%2520and%2520Rossby%2520solitons%26Ntx%3Dmode%2520matchall.}}&lt;/ref&gt; capillary- and inertia-gravity waves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Simple Theory of Capillary-Gravity Wave Turbulence|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19970009859.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; nonlinear waves and turbulence, [[Rossby wave]]s, [[sea level]] measurements, sea surface geometry, [[magnetic field]] at sea surface, wind generated wave dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Effect of the Degree Of Wave Development On The Sea State Bias in Radar Altimetry Measurement|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?N=0&amp;Ntk=Title&amp;Ntt=The%20effect%20of%20the%20degree%20of%20wave%20development%20on%20the%20sea&amp;Ntx=mode%20matchall}}&lt;/ref&gt; adsorbed film and oscillations.

'''Ronald Edward Santo''' (February 25, 1940 – December 3, 2010) was an American [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[third baseman]] who played for the [[Chicago Cubs]] from 1960 through 1973 and the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at Baseball Reference"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/santoro01.shtml?redir Ron Santo at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=santoro01 Ron Santo at Baseball Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Santo became a member of the Cubs broadcasting team providing commentary for Cubs games on [[WGN (AM)|WGN radio]] and remained at that position until his death in 2010.&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Library"/&gt; In 1999, he was selected to the Cubs All-Century Team. He was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;National Baseball Hall of Fame, Ron Santo [http://www.baseballhall.org/hof/santo-ron] Retrieved April 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Santo was raised in Southeast Seattle, attending [[Franklin High School (Seattle)]], and played newly organized youth baseball in the Babe Ruth League.  He grew up near [[Sicks Stadium]], home of the [[Pacific Coast League]]’s [[Seattle Rainiers]], and had summer jobs there as a batboy, groundskeeper and clubhouse attendant, while playing three sports in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jaffe|first1=Jay|title=The Cooperstown Casebook: Who's in the Baseball Hall of Fame, Who Should Be In, and Who Should Pack Their Plaques|date=July 30, 2017|url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2017/07/25/hall-fame-cooperstown-casebook-ron-santo|accessdate=July 30, 2017|chapter=Ch. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 14 he made the Seattle, Washington All Star Babe Ruth team which advanced to the 1954 Babe Ruth World Series.  In a game at then Washington DC Stadium, Dave Tacher (coach) inserted Santo at first base to replace his 15 year old who broke his thumb.  In that game Santo hit a grand slam home run over the 354 foot mark in left center field and the Washington All Stars defeated Tennessee.

Santo was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] for nine seasons during his 15-year career. He led the [[National League]] (NL) in [[triple (baseball)|triples]] one time, in [[base on balls|walks]] four times, and in [[on-base percentage]] two times.&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Hall of Fame"&gt;[http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081202&amp;content_id=10281&amp;vkey=hof_news Ron Santo at the Baseball Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212024401/http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081202&amp;content_id=10281&amp;vkey=hof_news |date=December 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[batting average|batted]] .300 or more and hit 30 or more [[home run]]s four times each, and is the only third baseman in MLB history to post eight consecutive seasons with over 90 [[run batted in|runs batted in]] (RBI) (1963–70).&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Hall of Fame"/&gt; Santo is second to Mathews in [[slugging average]] (.464), and is the third ranking third baseman in walks (1,108), in RBI (1,331), and [[total bases]] (3,779).

He also was a [[Gold Glove Award]] winner for five consecutive seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rawlings.com/GoldGloveHistory.aspx History: Rawlings Gold Glove Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_nl.shtml#multi National League Gold Glove Award winners at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; He led the NL in [[total chances]] eight times, in games, [[putout]]s and [[assist (baseball)|assists]] seven times each, and in [[double play]]s six times.&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Hall of Fame"/&gt; From {{mlby|1966}} to {{mlby|1974}}, he held the NL record for assists in a single season. He also set NL records for career assists (4,532), total chances (6,777) and double plays (389) at third base, all of which were eventually broken between {{mlby|1986}} and {{mlby|1988}} by [[Mike Schmidt]]. His NL total of 2,102 games at third base is 52 short of Mathews' league record, and he ranks sixth in putouts (1,930) and ninth in [[fielding percentage]] (.954).

Santo enjoyed his success despite battling [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|diabetes]] since he was a teenager, a condition which was carefully and generally concealed publicly until 1971; it eventually necessitated the amputation of the lower half of both his legs.&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Library"&gt;[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Ron_Santo_1940 Ron Santo at the Baseball Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019222310/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Ron_Santo_1940 |date=October 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1979, Santo endorsed the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's annual Ron Santo Walk to Cure Diabetes in Chicago. He helped raise over $65&amp;nbsp;million for the foundation. In 2002, he was named the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's "Person of the Year".&lt;ref name="Ron Santo Uniform Number to be Retired at Baseball Almanac"/&gt;

==Major league career==
[[File:Ron Santo 1961.png|thumb|left|180px|Santo in 1961]]

===Chicago Cubs (1960–73)===
Santo was signed as a [[free agent]] by the Chicago Cubs in [[1959 Chicago Cubs season|1959]], and made his debut on June 26, 1960.&lt;ref name=br&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/santoro01.shtml|title=Ron Santo Statistics and History|work=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ron Santo Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=santoro01 |title=Ron Santo Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac|publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1961 Chicago Cubs season|1961]] he set a Cubs record with 41 [[double play]]s at third base, breaking the previous mark of 33 set by [[Bernie Friberg]] in 1923. In [[1962 Chicago Cubs season|1962]] he led the National League in [[assist (baseball)|assists]] for the first time with 332, setting the team record for assists at third base, breaking the mark of 323 set by [[Randy Jackson (baseball)|Randy Jackson]] in 1951. Santo continued to lead the NL in assists every year through 1968, breaking [[Ned Williamson]]'s major league record of leading the league six times; [[Brooks Robinson]] went on to lead the [[American League]] eight times. [[Mike Schmidt]] eventually tied Santo's NL mark of seven. In 1963 Santo broke the modern NL record with 374 assists at third base, passing [[Tommy Leach]]'s 1904 mark of 371. In 1966, he set the all-time league record with 391, the previous record being [[Billy Shindle]]'s 382 in 1892; his total was 99 higher than that of league runner-up [[Ken Boyer]]. Santo broke his own record in 1967 with 393 assists,&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/santoro01.php |title=Ron Santo at The Baseball Page |publisher=Thebaseballpage.com|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which remained the NL record until Schmidt posted 404 in 1974. He also finished fourth in the [[1967 Chicago Cubs season|1967]] NL [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] voting results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1967.shtml#NLmvp |title=1967 National League Most Valuable Player Award voting results at Baseball Almanac |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santo's assist totals from 1963 through 1968 were the six highest by an NL third baseman between 1905 and 1973. He also led the NL in [[putout]]s every year from 1962 through 1967 and again in 1969, tying the league record shared by [[Pie Traynor]] and [[Willie Jones (baseball)|Willie Jones]] in leading the league seven times;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/news/2007/election/vc/santo.htm |title=Ron Santo at the Baseball Hall of Fame |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=June 30, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630103614/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/news/2007/election/vc/santo.htm |archivedate=June 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Wallach]] later tied the mark as well.

Santo was deeply saddened by the loss of teammate [[Ken Hubbs]], the Cubs second baseman, killed in a plane crash just prior to the 1964 season. Santo was interviewed by [[Tom Harmon]], narrator of the film ''A Glimpse of Greatness–The Story of Ken Hubbs'', in which Santo paid the highest respects to the young Hubbs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In 1969, Santo and [[1969 Chicago Cubs season|the Cubs]] were in first place in the [[National League East]] for 180 days, before going 8–17 in their final 25 games, while the [[1969 New York Mets season|New York "Miracle" Mets]] went 37–11 in their final 48 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=baseball+digest+ron+santo#v=onepage&amp;q=baseball%20digest%20ron%20santo&amp;f=false|title='&amp;#39;Ron Santo: A Hall of Fame Plaque In His Future?'&amp;#39; by Bill Dray, Baseball Digest, July 1992, Vol. 51, No. 7, ISSN 0005-609X|publisher=Google Books |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that season, the Cubs sent their entire starting [[infielder|infield]], including Santo, to the [[1969 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in Washington, D.C.; he and Cubs shortstop [[Don Kessinger]] started for the NL team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS196907230.shtml |title=1969 All-Star game at Baseball Reference|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santo finished the season with a .289 [[batting average]], 29 [[home run]]s and a career-high 123 [[runs batted in]] (RBI), and finished fifth in the NL's MVP voting.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1969.shtml#NLmvp |title=1969 Most Valuable Player Award voting results at Baseball Reference|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1969 season, Santo became known for performing a heel click after a game on June 22, 1969 against the [[Montreal Expos]].&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Page"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Ron_Santo_1940 |title=Ron Santo at the Baseball Library |publisher=Baseballlibrary.com |date=June 26, 1960 |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019222310/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Ron_Santo_1940 |archivedate=October 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Going into the bottom of the ninth inning, the Expos were leading 6–3. With one out, [[Paul Popovich]] hit a [[single (baseball)|single]] and moved up to second base after another single by [[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy Williams]]. Although Santo [[Baseball rules|grounded out]] for the second out, Popovich and Williams each moved up a base. Then future Hall of Famer [[Ernie Banks]] singled to bring home Williams and Popovich and bring the Cubs within a [[run (baseball)|run]]. [[Rick Bladt]] substituted as a [[pinch runner]] for Banks. That set it up for [[Jim Hickman (1960s outfielder)|Jim Hickman]], who hit a two-run [[walk-off home run]] to win the game 7–6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHN/CHN196906221.shtml |title=June 22, 1969 Expos-Cubs box score at Baseball Reference|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date=June 22, 1969 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hickman reached [[home plate]], Santo was so excited that after congratulating him by bear hugging and pounding him on his head, Santo ran down the third base line and jumped three times, clicking his heels on each jump.&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Library"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Page"/&gt;

The next day, Santo walked into [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Leo Durocher]]'s office; Durocher asked him to keep clicking his heels whenever the Cubs won at [[Wrigley Field]] to motivate the team. Santo continued this after every home win. The stunt antagonized opponents and served to make the team a target for payback in the final weeks of the season. When the Cubs began their September [[Losing streak (sport)|swoon]], which took place shortly after Santo called out rookie teammate [[Donald Young (baseball)|Don Young]] in public after a loss against the Mets in New York, he discontinued the heel click routine suddenly. His final "click" was performed on September 2, the last Cub home victory while still in first place. During and after the epic collapse, Santo never again performed the heel click, as critics decried the routine for its arrogance and overconfidence, which many believe was at the root of the late fade. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} On the day Santo was enshrined in the Hall of Fame, the Cubs' starting lineup all did the "kick" at the start of the game in tribute.

====Trade veto====
In 1973, Santo became the first player to invoke the ten-and-five rule under the [[collective bargaining]] agreement signed after the [[1972 Major League Baseball strike]]. The rule allowed players with ten years' service, the last five with the same team, to decline any trade.&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Page"/&gt; The Cubs had agreed upon a deal to send Santo to the [[California Angels]]; the ballclub would have received in return two young pitchers: [[Andy Hassler]], who went on to have a middling career as a [[Relief pitcher|reliever]]/spot starter, and [[Bruce Heinbechner]], a very highly regarded left-handed pitching [[Prospect (sports)|prospect]], who died before the beginning of the 1974 season.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=heinbe001bru&lt;/ref&gt; Santo didn't want to play on the West Coast and vetoed the deal.

===Chicago White Sox (1974)===
The Cubs still wanted to trade Santo, and since his preference was to stay in Chicago, they worked out a deal with the White Sox in December 1973, acquiring [[catcher]] [[Steve Swisher]], and three young pitchers: [[Jim Kremmel]], [[Ken Frailing]], and one of Santo's future co-broadcasters, [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]].&lt;ref name="Ron Santo Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac"/&gt; The White Sox already had a third baseman, [[Bill Melton]], so Santo was relegated mostly to [[designated hitter]] duty, which he hated. He wanted to play in the field, but White Sox manager [[Chuck Tanner]] would not bench Melton and unsuccessfully tried Santo at second base. Finishing [[1974 Chicago White Sox season|1974]] with a .221 batting average and 5 home runs, Santo retired from baseball at the age of 34.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

==Post-retirement==

===Broadcast career===
As the "single biggest Cubs fan of all time", Santo joined the Cubs' broadcast booth in 1990 as the [[WGN (AM)|WGN radio]] [[color commentator]].&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Library"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cubsb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/team/broadcasters.jsp?c_id=chc |title=Chicago Cubs Broadcasters |publisher=Chicago.cubs.mlb.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with [[Sports commentary|play-by-play announcer]] [[Pat Hughes (sportscaster)|Pat Hughes]], and these radio broadcasts were also known as the ''[[Pat and Ron Show]]''. He also worked with [[Harry Caray]], [[Thom Brennaman]], Steve Stone and [[Bob Brenly]]. Santo also briefly worked with [[Chicago Bears]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] commentator [[Wayne Larrivee]]. In addition to his broadcasting career, he did commercials for [[Seattle Sutton's Healthy Eating]], which he endorsed, along with joining Hughes in ads for [[Walgreens]] and [[Chevrolet]]. In Chicago, Santo was known for his unabashed broadcast enthusiasm, including groans and cheers during the game. As excitable as Santo was when a great play for the Cubs occurred, he was equally as vocal in his displeasure when events turned against the Cubs.

===Struggle with diabetes===
In the early years of his playing career, he carefully concealed the fact that he had [[diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]]. He feared that if this information were to be known, he would be forced into retirement. Because the methods of regulating diabetes in the 1960s and 1970s were not as advanced as they are today,&lt;ref name=SomewhereACub/&gt; Santo gauged his [[blood sugar]] levels based on his moods.&lt;ref name="thisoldcub"&gt;{{cite video |people = Santo, Jeff | title = ''This Old Cub'' | medium = DVD | publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408261/| date = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If he felt his blood sugar was low, he would snack on a candy bar in the [[locker room|clubhouse]].&lt;ref name="thisoldcub"/&gt;

As part of the publicity surrounding "Ron Santo Day" at Wrigley Field on August 28, 1971, he revealed his struggle with diabetes. He was diagnosed with this disease at the age of 18, and was given a life expectancy of 25 years. Santo had both his legs amputated below the knee as a result of his diabetes: the right in 2001 and the left in 2002.

In 2004 Santo and his battle against diabetes were the subject of a documentary, ''[[This Old Cub]]''. The film was written, co-produced and directed by Santo's son Jeff.&lt;ref name=SomewhereACub/&gt;

Santo shared a bond in this respect with 2008 Cubs rookie [[Sam Fuld]], who also suffers from type 1 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=146449 |work=Daily Herald | title=Diabetes won't hold back Cubs' outfield prospect |accessdate = June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charities===
The Santo family has been involved with the [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation]] since 1979, with the annual Ron Santo Walk to Cure Diabetes in Chicago having raised over $65&amp;nbsp;million for the organization. In 2002, Santo was named the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's "Person of the Year".&lt;ref name="Ron Santo Uniform Number to be Retired at Baseball Almanac"/&gt; Santo also inspired [[Bill Holden (schoolteacher)|Bill Holden]] to walk 2,100 miles from [[Arizona]] to Chicago to raise $250,000 for diabetes research. During the [[2016 World Series]], the JDRF hosted watch parties for road games hosted by family members.

===Death===
Santo died at 12:40&amp;nbsp;am on December 3, 2010&lt;ref name="Rozner"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20101224/sports/712259923/|title=Ron Santo's last gift to his family|last=Rozner|first=Barry|date=December 24, 2010|work=dailyherald.com|accessdate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a hospital in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], due to complications from [[bladder cancer]] and diabetes.

He was eulogized by his longtime broadcast partner [[Pat Hughes (radio sports announcer)|Pat Hughes]], along with Cubs owner [[Thomas S.

Santo was later cremated and his ashes scattered on the field at the Friendly Confines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ron Santo (1940–2010)|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/62471182|accessdate=2011-04-23|publisher=findagrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 2011, Santo was memorialized and "immortalized" at Wrigley Field with the presentation of a statue in his likeness.  The statue is a portrayal of a young Santo playing defense at third base, leaning to his right while throwing a ball.

==Hall of Fame candidacy==

===BBWAA===
When Santo first became eligible for election to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in {{bhofy|1980}}, he was named on less than four percent of all ballots cast by the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] (BBWAA), resulting in his removal from the ballot in subsequent years; he was one of several players re-added to the ballot in {{bhofy|1985}} following widespread complaints about overlooked candidates, with the remainder of their 15 years of eligibility restored even if this extended beyond the usual limit of 20 years after their last season. After receiving 13 percent of the vote in the 1985 election, his vote totals increased in 10 of the next 13 years until he received 43 percent of the vote in his final year on the {{bhofy|1998}} ballot, finishing third in the voting behind electee [[Don Sutton]] and 2000 inductee [[Tony Pérez]].

===Veterans Committee===
Following revamped voting procedures for the [[Veterans Committee]], which had elected players retired for over 20 years to the Hall of Fame, Santo finished third in {{bhofy|2003}}, tied for first in {{bhofy|2005}}, and again finished first in voting for the {{bhofy|2007}} and {{bhofy|2009}} inductions, but fell short of the required number of votes each year.

===Golden Era Committee===
Santo's next opportunity for admission to the Hall of Fame following a further major change to the voting structure and process announced in 2010, came during the voting in 2011 by the new 16-member Golden Era Committee which considers every three years, ten candidates identified by the Historical Overview Committee from the 1947 to 1972 era.&lt;ref&gt;National Baseball Hall of Fame, Eras: Golden, [http://www.baseballhall.org/hall-famers/rules-election/eras-golden "Rules For election For Managers, Umpires, Executives, And Players For Golden Era Candidates To The National Baseball Hall Of Fame"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430052048/http://baseballhall.org/hall-famers/rules-election/eras-golden |date=April 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Santo became a widely supported candidate for selection, his initial poor showing in balloting has been attributed to various factors, including a longtime tendency of BBWAA voters to overlook third basemen; at the time Santo retired, only three of the over 120 players elected were third basemen, and only [[Pie Traynor]] had been elected by the BBWAA. Also, the fact that Santo's best years occurred in the 1960s, when offensive statistics were relatively lower than in many other eras (due to an enlarged [[strike zone]] and raised [[pitcher's mound]]s, among other things), has been cited as a factor that led the voters to perhaps overlook him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20060507055551/http://www.thebaseballpage.com/positions/rankings/3B.php Ranking the Third Basemen at The Baseball Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Hall of Fame Case for Ron Santo at The Cub Reporter"&gt;[http://www.thecubreporter.com/2008/12/05/hall-fame-case-ron-santo-part-1-3 The Hall of Fame Case for Ron Santo at The Cub Reporter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206054103/http://www.thecubreporter.com/2008/12/05/hall-fame-case-ron-santo-part-1-3 |date=December 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible reason that was suggested was that voters had not focused sufficiently on Santo's high walk totals and defense. These aspects of play are perhaps more valued by [[sabermetrics]] — newer methods of evaluating a baseball player's productivity — than they have been by BBWAA voters in the past. For example, Santo's career [[On-base plus slugging#Adjusted OPS|adjusted on-base plus slugging]] (OPS+; the sum of a player's on-base percentage and slugging percentage, adjusted for the park and league in which he played, and expressed as a percentage of the league average) would rank him exactly in the middle of the ten major league third basemen who were in the Hall of Fame in 2011.&lt;ref name="The Hall of Fame Case for Ron Santo at The Cub Reporter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/onbase_plus_slugging_plus_career.shtml |title=Career Leaders &amp; Records for Adjusted OPS|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One argument that was raised against Santo's Hall of Fame candidacy is that his [[Baseball statistics|batting statistics]], over the course of his career, were significantly better at home than on the road. He hit 216 of his 342 home runs at home, and only 126 on the road.&lt;ref name="Ron Santo Home-Away splits at Baseball Reference"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?n1=santoro01&amp;year=Career&amp;t=b#hmvis|title=Ron Santo Home-Away splits at Baseball Reference |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His career batting average at home was .296, versus .257 on the road.&lt;ref name="Ron Santo Home-Away splits at Baseball Reference"/&gt; However, several players elected to the Hall of Fame by the BBWAA, such as [[Carl Yastrzemski]], [[Wade Boggs]], [[Jim Rice]] and [[Kirby Puckett]], batted significantly better in their home parks than they did on the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?n1=yastrca01&amp;year=Career&amp;t=b#hmvis|title=Carl Yastrzemski Home-Away splits at Baseball Reference |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?n1=boggswa01&amp;year=Career&amp;t=b#hmvis |title=Wade Boggs Home-Away splits at Baseball Reference |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?n1=riceji01&amp;year=Career&amp;t=b#hmvis |title=Jim Rice Home-Away splits at Baseball Reference|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?n1=puckeki01&amp;year=Career&amp;t=b#hmvis |title=Kirby Puckett Home-Away splits at Baseball Reference |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall of Famers with a significant differential between their home numbers and road numbers in terms of home runs include [[Mel Ott]] (323 homers at home and 188 on the road), [[Frank Robinson]] (321 at home, 265 on the road), [[Jimmie Foxx]] (299 at home, 235 on the road) and [[Hank Greenberg]] (205 at home, 126 on the road).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/event_hr.cgi?n1=ottme01&amp;t=b |title=Mel Ott home run log at Baseball Reference |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/event_hr.cgi?n1=robinfr02&amp;t=b |title=Frank Robinson home run log at Baseball Reference|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/event_hr.cgi?n1=foxxji01&amp;t=b |title=Jimmie Foxx home run log at Baseball Reference |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/event_hr.cgi?n1=greenha01&amp;t=b |title=Hank Greenberg home run log at Baseball Reference |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have also commented that two Cub 
players who were in their prime during Santo's prime years have already been honored by the Hall of Fame ([[Ferguson Jenkins]] and Billy Williams), and the Cubs also featured a third Hall of Famer, Ernie Banks, who was arguably past his prime, yet the team never won a pennant. However, the late 1960s Cubs were far from the only team in baseball history with multiple Hall of Famers that did not win a pennant or a [[World Series]].

Santo also fell short of such traditional standards of Hall election as [[3,000 hit club|3,000 hits]] and [[500 home run club|500 home runs]]; however, by the time his career ended, only two third basemen ([[Brooks Robinson]] and [[Lave Cross]]) had even collected 2,500 hits, and only one ([[Eddie Mathews]]) had reached the 500-home run plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/bp/1409616.html |title=Hall Debates: Ron Santo at ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN  |date=July 24, 2002 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/robinbr01.shtml |title=Brooks Robinson at Baseball Reference |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/crossla01.shtml |title=Lave Cross at Baseball Reference |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/matheed01.shtml |title=Eddie Mathews at Baseball Reference |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill James]], a notable [[sabermetrics|statistical guru]] who has ranked Santo among the 100 greatest players of all time (sixth among third basemen), believed his election to the Hall of Fame was long overdue.

Even though Santo was disappointed at being bypassed by the Hall of Fame, on the day his jersey number 10 was retired by the Cubs, the ever-optimistic and emotional "old Cub" told the cheering Wrigley Field crowd, "This is ''my'' Hall of Fame!"&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Hall of Fame"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ron Santo Uniform Number to be Retired at Baseball Almanac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/ron_santo_press_release.shtml|title=Ron Santo Uniform Number to be Retired at Baseball Almanac |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Ryne Sandberg]]'s Hall of Fame acceptance speech in 2005, Sandberg reiterated his support for Santo's selection, saying, "...for what it's worth, Ron Santo just gained one more vote from the Veterans Committee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chi-17-ron-santo-rogerssep17,0,807360.column |title=www.chicagotribune.com |work=Chicago Tribune |date=October 19, 2011 |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020164626/http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chi-17-ron-santo-rogerssep17,0,807360.column |archivedate=October 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, 2007, the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] adopted HB 109 ([[Tom Cross (politician)|Cross]]), urging the Veterans Committee of the Baseball Hall of Fame to elect Ron Santo to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Some baseball historians contend the hall of fame induction process was unjust to Santo.
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While Santo initially received little support for induction into the Hall of Fame, his standing among baseball enthusiasts and [[Sabermetrics|sabermetrician]]s gradually increased over time, culminating with his induction to the Hall of Fame two years after his death.&lt;ref name="Ron Santo Elected to Hall of Fame"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SomewhereACub&gt;{{cite web|first=Phil|last=Taylor|title=Somewhere A Cub Is Smiling|date=December 19, 2011|work=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1193034/index.htm|accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Santo elected to Hall of Fame by veterans panel|url=https://news.yahoo.com/santo-elected-hall-fame-veterans-panel-161651046.html|author=Walker, B.|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were charged with determining whether Santo would be elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Class of 2012. Williams, Santo's long-time teammate and friend, had made a fresh case for Santo, emphasizing his personal struggle with diabetes during his career, and his post-retirement charitable work to try to find a cure. Santo received 15 of the 16 possible votes and was the only one of the ten Golden Era Ballot candidates to be elected to the Hall of Fame by the Committee's first vote.&lt;ref name="Ron Santo Elected to Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseballhall.org/news/press-releases/ron-santo-elected-national-baseball-hall-fame-golden-era-committee|title=Ron Santo Elected to Hall of Fame|accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SomewhereACub/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Baseball Hall of Fame, November 3, 2011, "Ten Named to Golden Era Ballot for Baseball (1947 to 1972) Hall of Fame Election"[http://www.baseballhall.org/news/press-releases/ten-named-golden-era-ballot-baseball-hall-fame-election]&lt;/ref&gt; Santo's widow Vicki accepted the plaque on Induction Day, and spoke about his love of the Cubs and his devotion to sufferers of diabetes.

Santo led the league in double plays six times (1961, 1964, 1966–68, 1971), tying the major league record held by [[Heinie Groh]];&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Hall of Fame"/&gt; [[Mike Schmidt]] also later tied this record. He led the National League in total chances every season from 1961 through 1968.&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Hall of Fame"/&gt; He appeared at third base in every Cubs game from April 19, [[1964 Chicago Cubs season|1964]] through May 31, [[1966 Chicago Cubs season|1966]], establishing a league record with 364 consecutive games at the position;&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Hall of Fame"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Page"/&gt; his 164 games at third base in [[1965 Chicago Cubs season|1965]] remain the major league record.

He won the [[Major League Baseball Player of the Month Award|NL Player of the Month award]] three times: June 1963 (.384, 6 HR, 22 RBI); July 1964 (.395, 7 HR, 27 RBI); and June 1969 (.400, 6 HR, 34 RBI).

Santo broke Eddie Mathews' NL record of 369 career double plays at third base in 1972, and in 1973 he broke Mathews' league records of 4,284 assists and 6,606 total chances. Schmidt passed Santo's record for double plays in 1986, his record for assists in 1987, and his mark for total chances in 1988. During his 14-season run with the Cubs, Santo hit 337 home runs, then the eighth most by a NL [[right-handedness|right-handed]] hitter; his 1,071 career walks with the Cubs remain the team record for a right-handed hitter. He was the first third baseman to hit 300 home runs and win five Gold Gloves, a feat since matched only by Schmidt and [[Scott Rolen]].

Santo became the first player in major league history to wear a [[batting helmet]] with protective ear flaps, when in 1966, in the midst of trying to break the Cubs' modern consecutive-game [[hitting streak]] record of 27 games (set by [[Hack Wilson]] in 1929), Santo was sidelined for nearly two weeks following a pitch thrown by the Mets' [[Jack Fisher]]. The [[brushback pitch|beaning]] [[Bone fracture|fractured]] his cheekbone and ended his consecutive playing streak. When he returned (and broke the hitting record with a 28-game streak&lt;ref name="Ron Santo at the Baseball Page"/&gt;) he was wearing an improvised ear flap on his batting helmet in order to protect the injury; ear flaps have since become standard equipment on batting helmets.

In 1999, he was named to the Cubs All-Century Team.

On September 28, 2003, Santo's jersey No. 10 was retired by the Cubs organization, making him the third player so honored behind his teammates Ernie Banks (#14) and Billy Williams (#26).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/history/retired_numbers.jsp |title=Chicago Cubs retired numbers at mlb.com |publisher=Chicago.cubs.mlb.com |date=January 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent Cubs had worn No. 10 after Santo's retirement, notably [[Dave Kingman]] and [[Leon Durham]]; the most recent wearer had been interim manager [[Bruce Kimm]], just the previous year. In April 2004, Santo was inducted into the inaugural class of the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (Washington's high school athletics league) Hall of Fame as a graduate of Seattle's [[Franklin High School (Seattle, Washington)|Franklin High School]].&lt;ref name="WIAAHof"&gt;[http://www.wiaa.com/HOF/ Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928025409/http://www.wiaa.com/HOF/ |date=September 28, 2007 }} – at the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association&lt;/ref&gt; About a month after Santo's death, Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts announced that Santo would be honored by the Cubs in the [[2011 Chicago Cubs season|2011 season]]. From spring training through the end of the season, the Cubs wore a patch on the sleeve of their jersey with the number 10 on it.

'''Thomas Tamm''' (born 1952) is a public defender in [[Washington County, Maryland]]. He formerly worked as an attorney in the [[United States Department of Justice]] (USDOJ) [[Office of Intelligence Policy and Review]] during 2004 when senior Justice officials responded to the [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|warrantless NSA surveillance]] concerning eavesdropping on U.S. citizens. He was an anonymous [[whistleblower]] to ''[[The New York Times]]'', making the initial disclosures which led to reporters winning [[Pulitzer Prize]]s in 2006. Although Maryland agreed to drop ethics charges against him in 2009 relating to those disclosures, and the USDOJ announced it had dropped its investigation in 2011, the D.C. Office of Bar Counsel announced in January 2016 that it had brought disciplinary charges against Tamm relating to those events. Despite some controversy with respect to politicisation of that office and similar charges being brought to silence attorney whistleblowers especially beginning in 2014, Tamm in March 2016 agreed to public censure by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in order to allow him to proceed with his life and career.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-03-24/warrantless-wiretap-whistleblower-agrees-to-punishment-for-exposing-bush-era-surveillance&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The son of a former assistant director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], nephew of another former FBI assistant director who became a U.S. Court of Appeals judge for the District of Columbia Circuit ([[Edward Allen Tamm]]),  and brother of another career FBI agent, Tamm attended [[Brown University]] and graduated in 1974.

After graduating from [[Georgetown Law School]] and being admitted to the bar, Tamm joined the state's attorney's office, and after gaining additional experience, joined the United States Department of Justice's Capital Case Unit, where he litigated death penalty cases. He eventually joined the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, where he was liaison with the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|(FISA) Court]].&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/government-elections-politics/united-states-of-secrets/the-frontline-interview-thomas-tamm/&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporters [[James Risen]] and [[Eric Lichtblau]] won a Pulitzer prize for that reporting in 2006.&lt;ref name="usnews.com"&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-01-27/pre-snowden-whistleblower-thomas-tamm-faces-misconduct-charges-12-years-later&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, FBI agents raided Tamm's house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Looking For a Leaker|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/32521?tid=relatedcl |date=August 13, 2007 |publisher=[[Newsweek]] |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on suspicion of his involvement in leaking the details, but it was not until 2008 – online on December 13&lt;ref name="newsweek1"/&gt; and then in the December 22 issue of ''[[Newsweek]]''&lt;ref name="newsweek1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/174601|title=The Fed Who Blew the Whistle: Is he a hero or a criminal?|last=Isikoff|first=Michael|date=2008-12-13|work=Newsweek|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215105850/http://www.newsweek.com/id/174601|archivedate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; – that his role was confirmed and Tamm began speaking out publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/4/16/justice_dept_whistleblower_responds_to_latest |title=Whistleblower Defends Decision to Leak Bush Domestic Surveillance Program &amp; Calls for Prosecution of Gov’t Officials and Telecoms |date=16 April 2009 |publisher=[[Democracy Now!]] |accessdate=June 4, 2010 |last=Goodman |first=Amy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2011, after inauguration of President Barack Obama (who had criticized the program) and a lengthy criminal investigation, the Justice Department announced that it would be dropping its investigation of Tamm and would not file charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/no-charges-for-man-who-leaked-surveillance-program/2011/04/26/AFt9o6rE_story.html | title=No charges for man who leaked surveillance program| work=The Washington Post | date=April 26, 2011 | first=Shyamantha | last=Asokan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media Exposure in 2012-2013==
On August 22, 2012 ''The New York Times'' published an ''Op-doc'' (a forum of short documentaries produced by independent filmmakers), produced by [[Laura Poitras]] and entitled, ''The Program''.&lt;ref&gt;Poitras, Laura, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/opinion/the-national-security-agencys-domestic-spying-program.html?_r=2 ''The Program''], New York Times Op-Docs, August 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The producer characterized it as preliminary work that would be included in a documentary planned for release in 2013, as the final part of the trilogy based on interviews with [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], a 32-year veteran of the [[National Security Agency]], who also became a whistleblower and described the details of the [[Stellar Wind (code name)|Stellar Wind]] project that he helped to design. Binney stated that the program he worked on, the [[Utah Data Center|facility]] being built at [[Bluffdale, Utah]], had been designed for foreign espionage, but in 2001 was converted to spying on citizens in the United States, prompting concerns by him and others that the actions were illegal and unconstitutional, which led to disclosures.

On October 29, 2012 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] heard arguments regarding the constitutionality of the amendments to the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) that were used to authorize the creation of such facilities and justify such actions. The determination of the court was not unanimous in ''James R. Clapper, Jr., Director Of National Intelligence, et al., Petitioners v. Amnesty International USA et al.'',&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-1025 Clapper v. Amnesty International USA]'' ( ) 638 F. 3d 118, reversed and remanded, No. 11–1025. Argued October 29, 2012—Decided February 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as Justice Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan joined.

In December 2013, the Public Broadcasting System's Frontline documentary series interviewed Tamm concerning the FISA Court.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

==Bar Discipline==
In January, 2016, the District of Columbia Office of Disciplinary Counsel announced, first to the [[National Law Journal]], that in December it had filed ethics charges against Tamm (a member of the D.C. Bar since 1978) as a result of an investigation that it claimed dated back to 2009, for violating the confidences of his then-client the U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;ref name="usnews.com"/&gt; Whistleblower lawyers analogized this to the ongoing disciplinary case brought in 2014 upon a complaint by [[General Electric]] against Washington D.C. whistleblower lawyer Lynne Bernabei and [[Notre Dame Law School]] professor [[G. Robert Blakey]] for advising in-house counsel Adriana Koeck to make her disclosures publicly to a [[New York Times]] reporter, as well as to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] and federal prosecutors.&lt;ref name="corporatecrimereporter.com"&gt;http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/whistleblower-lawyers-counterattack-against-dc-disciplinary-counsel/&lt;/ref&gt; In December, the 80-year old and retired Blakey agreed to accept similar unappealable discipline with respect to his advice to former student Koeck.&lt;ref&gt;http://abovethelaw.com/2015/12/emeritus-law-professor-sanctioned-over-the-disclosure-of-documents/&lt;/ref&gt; Tamm's attorney said the Maryland Bar had investigated Tamm for the same disclosures in 2009, and decided not to press charges.&lt;ref name="corporatecrimereporter.com"/&gt; On March 24, 2016, the National Law Journal reported that Tamm had agreed to accept censure by the D.C. Court of Appeals to resolve that disciplinary proceeding and allow him to continue his life and career, rather than face the prospect of many years of litigation before many courts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202753110833/Former-DOJ-Lawyer-Accepts-Public-Censure-for-Leaking-BushEra-Surveillance&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1358">'''Turkey Tailfeather Woman''' was a [[Sioux|Dakota]] woman who is said to have given the '''Drum Dance''' to the [[Anishinaabe]] people. The Drum Dance is a set of spiritual beliefs that center on Turkey Tailfeather Woman and her escape from the American military, after which she built a large drum while in hiding. The religion spread throughout a large swathe of North America after about 1877. The drum used in the Drum Dance is the forerunner of the large drum used in modern [[powwow]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55408">The '''United States Refugee Admissions Program''' ('''USRAP''') is a consortium of federal agencies and [[nonprofit]] organizations working together{{when|date=October 2018}}, both overseas and domestically, to identify and admit qualified refugees for [[third country resettlement|resettlement]] into the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextchannel=385d3e4d77d73210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextoid=796b0eb389683210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD The United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) Consultation &amp; Worldwide Processing Priorities]", U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, last modified March 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As a program, USRAP is tasked with some of the humanitarian efforts that the United States chooses to undertake. Every year, thousands of refugees are welcomed into the United States and given the opportunity to build a better life for themselves. In this way, USRAP demonstrates the commitment of a people to humanitarian principles.

==Mission==
The [[U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) claims that USRAP’s mission is "to offer resettlement opportunities to persons overseas who are of special humanitarian concern, while protecting national security and combating fraud."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, [http://www.uscis.gov/USCIS/Resources/Resources%20for%20Congress/Congressional%20Reports/2011%20National%20Immigration%20&amp;%20Consular%20Conference%20Presentations/Refugee_Admissions_Program.pdf The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program] (March 2011), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The goals of USRAP are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;"[http://definitions.uslegal.com/u/u-s-refugee-admissions-program-usrap/ U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) Law &amp; Legal Definition]", USLegal, accessed October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Arranging refugees' placement by ensuring that approved refugees are sponsored and offered appropriate assistance upon arrival in the U.S.
*Providing refugees with basic necessities and core services during their initial resettlement period in the U.S.
*Promoting refugee self-sufficiency through employment as soon as possible after arrival in the U.S. in coordination with other refugee service and assistance programs.

==History==
According to the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. refugee resettlement program is based on the United States’ aspirations, which are compassion, generosity, and leadership and since 1975, over 3 million refugees from all over the world have been welcomed to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.state.gov/j/prm/ra/ Refugee Admissions]", U.S. Department of State, accessed October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Through 1946===
In response to the growing crisis in Europe posed by the rise of the Nazi party in Germany, private citizens took responsibility for the first refugee resettlement undertaken by the United States. Groups of concerned citizens worked to assist political, intellectual, cultural and scientific leaders who had fled the increasing repressive Fascist governments in Germany, Italy and Spain. Among those rescued in that initial group of refugees were the political scientist [[Hannah Arendt]], the painter [[Marc Chagall]], the novelist [[Franz Werfel]], the philosopher Alfredo Mendizabal, the medical scientist [[Fritz Kahn]], the sculptor [[Jacques Lipschitz]], the historian [[Golo Mann]], and the Nobel Prize–winning biochemist [[Otto Fritz Meyerhof|Otto Meyerhoff]]. Early actors in assisting refugees were the International Rescue Committee, the [[HIAS|Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society]] (HIAS), and [[Church World Service]] (CWS) who assisted thousands of refugees resettle in cities throughout the United States before the end of 1946. In the early stage of refugee resettlement in the U.S., faith communities in the United States played a significant role in protecting refugees and in helping them resettle. These faith-based organizations focused on resettling refugees during World War II and immediately thereafter. (Note: this was before the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees and long before the U.S. ratified the 1967 Protocol.)&lt;ref name="Eby"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Jessica Eby, Erika Iverson, Jenifer Smyers &amp; Erol Kekic |year=2011 |title=The faith community's role in refugee resettlement in the United States |journal=Journal of Refugee Studies |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=586–605 |doi=10.1093/jrs/fer038}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|590}}

===World War II through the Indo-Chinese Refugee Crises===
The U.S. government authorized refugee admissions on an ad hoc basis, designating specific populations for entry through "erratic and unpredictable authorizations."&lt;ref name="Eby"/&gt;{{rp|589}} The approach toward federal funding of refugee resettlement was similarly ad hoc. Generally speaking, the resettlement agencies provided the vast majority of the resources needed to support refugee.&lt;ref name="Eby"/&gt;{{rp|589}} The [[Displaced Persons Act|Displaced Persons Act of 1948]], the first refugee legislation enacted by U.S. Congress, provided for the admission of an additional 400,000 displaced Europeans. Previous to this Act, 250,000 displaced Europeans had already been admitted to the U.S.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rcusa.org/index.php?page=history |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813212012/http://www.rcusa.org/index.php?page=history |archive-date=2012-08-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, refugee admission laws evolved to accept people fleeing from communist regimes such as [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[North Korea]], [[China]], and [[Cuba]]. The refugees were usually supported by private (both ethnic, religious and secular) organizations, which formed the basis for the public/private role of U.S. refugee resettlement today.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Notable resettlement efforts include the admission of 35,000 Hungarians who fled the crushing of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]]. Resettlement activities were coordinated by a civilian Committee for Hungarian Refugee Relief under the chairmanship of Mr. Tracey F. Voorhees. This Committee has coordinated all activities in connection with what was termed "Operation Mercy." In the process it utilized the services of more than 20 volunteer and governmental agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol2no1/html/v02i1a07p_0001.htm |title=Report on Hungarian Refugees — Central Intelligence Agency |website=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1975====
After the fall of Vietnam in April 1975, the U.S. faced the challenge of resettling hundreds of thousands of displaced Indochinese refugees. They established an Indochinese refugee task force to respond to this crisis. After this situation, Congress realized it needed to create procedures that would deal with the ongoing resettlement of refugees and therefore passed the Refugee Act of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalassist.org/?id=124&amp;lang=en_us&amp;output=json |title=Legal Services of North Dakota » History of Refugee Resettlement in the United States |website=Legalassist.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1975, over three million refugees have been resettled in the U.S., with annual admissions figures ranging from a high of 207,000 in 1980 to a low of 27,110 in 2002. The average number admitted annually since 1980 is 98,000.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

====1980====
Congress passed the Refugee Act of 1980, which standardized the resettlement services of all refugees in the U.S. This act incorporates the definition of "refugee" used in the UN Protocol, provides for a regular flow of admittants, and has a contingency for emergency admissions of refugees. It also authorizes federal assistance for the resettlement of refugees.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

===2011 to today===
Today, USRAP comprises professional staffs from both religious and secular agencies working together in local communities. These groups both assist refugees with local integration and ensure that they have access to available services.&lt;ref name="Eby"/&gt;{{rp|592}}

Each year the President of the United States—after consulting with Congress and the appropriate agencies—determines the designated nationalities and processing priorities for refugee resettlement for the upcoming year. As of 2011, USRAP sponsored over 56,000 refugees in the U.S.&lt;ref name="State"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/prm/ra/c49034.htm |format=PDF |title=U.S. Refugee Admissions Programs FAQs |website=State.gov|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Proposed Refugee Admissions for 2012, the U.S. has addressed refugees’ challenges after their arrival and has responded to their needs. As a part of these efforts, the National Security Staff (NSS) tried to recognize issues and find interagency solutions. This implementation resulted in a noticeable increase in the one-time per capita Reception and Placement Grant administered by the Department of State in FY 2010.&lt;ref name="wrapsnet"&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Department of Health and Human Services, United States Department of Homeland Security, and United States Department of Health, foreword to Proposed Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2012|date=2011|url=http://www.wrapsnet.org/Portals/1/Reports/Reports%20to%20Congress/Final%20Report%20to%20Congress%20for%20FY%202012.pdf|format=PDF|website=Wrapsnet.org|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In FY 2011, the Department of State/PRM and the Department of Health and Human Service/IRR developed more "timely information on refugee arrivals and can better manage their work" and will keep co-leading this effort.&lt;ref name="wrapsnet"/&gt;

==Program structure==
===Government entities===
As was stated earlier, USRAP is not in the hands of any one particular agency of the federal government. Rather, it is a collaborative effort among many different agencies and departments of the federal government as well as a number of nonprofit organizations.&lt;ref name="admissions"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/prm/ra/index.htm |title=Refugee Admissions |website=State.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Department of State website, three entities make up the federal arm of the USRAP program: USCIS, which is part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]; the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, which is part of the Department of State; and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;ref name="admissions"/&gt;

====U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)====
{{main|United States Citizenship and Immigration Services}}
USCIS is responsible for activities that could be termed the "legal side" of USRAP operations. For example, it processes applications for refugee admission to the United States and applications for permanent residency. It also issues documents that permit refugees to return to the United States after traveling abroad.&lt;ref&gt;"The United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) Consultation &amp; Worldwide Processing Priorities."&lt;/ref&gt; Although USCIS is involved in humanitarian efforts by virtue of its inclusion in USRAP, the organization plays more of an incidental processing role than a humanitarian one.

====Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration====
{{main|Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration}}
As part of the U.S. Department of State, the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration is primarily responsible for USRAP’s operations abroad.&lt;ref name="about_PRM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/prm/about/index.htm |title=About PRM |website=State.gov |date=2016-12-21 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau’s website, its roughly 130 staff members perform primarily pass-through operations where they do not work directly with refugees. Rather, they work through other organizations such as the International Rescue Committee and other various intergovernmental organizations so as to provide services to refugees.&lt;ref name="about_PRM"/&gt; The Bureau also processes applications for refugee resettlement to the United States.&lt;ref name="about_PRM"/&gt;

====Office of Refugee Resettlement====
{{main|Office of Refugee Resettlement}}
Whereas the [[Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration]] primarily handles the foreign-based portions of USRAP and USCIS works with admissions and legal issues, the Office of Refugee Resettlement "provide[s] new populations with the opportunity to maximize their potential in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/about/what-we-do |title=What We Do &amp;#124; Office of Refugee Resettlement &amp;#124; ACF |website=Acf.hhs.gov |date=2017-01-09 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office of Refugee Resettlement plays a particularly important role within USRAP. Bringing refugees into the United States and processing their documents is quite a different thing from assisting those same refugees in living and working in a new and foreign culture. This is the task of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.

===Non-profit affiliates===
Nonprofits play a special role in USRAP. There are ten nonprofits appointed to work with the nation in either refugee referrals or in refugee resettlement. The nine non-profits currently working with USRAP are listed below:{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
*[[International Organization for Migration]]
*[[Church World Service]]
*Episcopal Migration Ministries
*Ethiopian Community Development Council
*[[HIAS]] (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society)
*[[International Rescue Committee]]
*[[Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service]]
*[[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]
*[[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]]
*[[World Relief]]

These nine nonprofits have some 360 affiliated offices across the nation. Each nonprofit provides help for refugees to become self-sufficient after their arrival in the United States. Specifically, each nonprofit provides housing, food, clothing, enrollment in school, English language classes, employment, health screenings, and other public services.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) Frequently Asked Questions – Iraqi Processing."&lt;/ref&gt; The following descriptions detail the unique contributions of two of the USRAP-involved nonprofits: the Church World Service and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.

====Church World Service====
[[Church World Service]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.churchworldservice.org/site/PageServer?pagename=action_what_assist_approach_main |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202062739/http://www.churchworldservice.org/site/PageServer?pagename=action_what_assist_approach_main |archive-date=2012-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; works with eight different denominations, the [[United Methodist Church]], [[United Church of Christ]], [[Reformed Church in America]], [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Episcopal Church, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, and Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Along with the basic public services provided by every nonprofit, the Church World Service administers the Religious Services Program, a program which helps refugees continue to practice their religion in the U.S. (regardless of the individual refugee’s specific religious practices).

====HIAS====
[[HIAS]] (founded as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society)&lt;ref name="resettlement"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110516164233/http://us.hias.org/en/pages/refugee-resettlement] &lt;/ref&gt; works within the Jewish Communal Network Commission to provide basic services to refugees.&lt;ref name="resettlement"/&gt; HIAS created the Refugee Family Enrichment program that addresses the problems a refugee family may face during resettlement.&lt;ref name="resettlement"/&gt; As part of their resettlement program through USRAP, HIAS teaches communication and conflict resolution skills that help families work through the difficulties of resettlement.

===Budget and funding===
During FY 2011, USRAP received $302 million from the federal government to fund its programs.&lt;ref name="budget"&gt;{{cite web|title="Department of State and Other International Programs," Appendix, Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2012|date=2011|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2013-APP/pdf/BUDGET-2013-APP-1-17.pdf|format=PDF|website=Gpo.gov|accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; That number will increase by over 25 percent (to $417 million) in FY 2012 and then drop back down to $310 million in FY 2013.&lt;ref name="budget"/&gt; According to the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, some of these monies are used to "[fund] ten public and private non-profit organizations to help provide initial services and assist refugees to achieve economic self-sufficiency as quickly as possible."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/prm/releases/factsheets/2011/181031.htm ]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129154750/http://www.state.gov/j/prm/releases/factsheets/2011/181031.htm |date=2016-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refugee eligibility==
According to USRAP, "A refugee is someone who has fled from his or her home country and cannot return because he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution based on religion, race, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group."&lt;ref name="State"/&gt; Once a refugee has fled their country into a neighboring country, there is a five-step process before they can be legally admitted into the United States of America. The process normally takes about eight months to a year.&lt;ref name="State"/&gt; Once a refugee has been admitted to the United States, it is the responsibility of the sponsoring organization to help them adapt to their new life. It is the hope that they will be enfolded into their community and become an asset to the country.

==Services==
===Cash assistance===
As touched on above, much of the literature on USRAP challenges the efficacy of the program’s cash assistance efforts. A recent study conducted by [[Columbia University]] argued that the programs failure to take individual circumstances into account when providing cash assistance has led to most of the problem:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;The notion that every refugee needs the same baseline services that has persisted since the inception of the refugee program aligns poorly with the goals of [[self-sufficiency]] and integration in the medium and long term. This is especially true given the diversity of the refugees arriving to the United States and the diversity of circumstances they face once here. Refugees have little agency over what services they can access, and even volags [local programs] have minimal room to account for refugees’ individual profiles when deciding what services to offer. Instead&amp;nbsp;... quick placement in employment is emphasized across the board, access to supplementary services and community support is determined essentially by lottery, and secondary migration is not accounted for.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/workshops/documents/IRCFINALREPORT.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124042220/http://sipa.columbia.edu/academics/workshops/documents/IRCFinalReport.pdf |archive-date=2012-11-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} }}
 
This same article goes on to point out the varying degree of assistance from state-to-state creates a random allocation of assistance for refugees. Depending on their location, some refugees are given transportation assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families [[(TANF)]] support, and local community assistance as well while other refugees are given the bare minimum of federal funding. This inequitable allocation leads to the successful integration of some refugees while others are left behind.&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;{{rp|11}}

===Employment===
The purpose of cash assistance is to help refugees find employment. This goal, however, is frequently not achieved. "…The cash assistance received was not enough to cover basic expenses and often ran out long before employment was secured."&lt;ref name="Georgetown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/hri_papers/4 |title="Refugee Crisis in America: Iraqis and Their Resettlement Experience" by Georgetown University Law Center, Human Rights Institute |website=Scholarship.law.georgetown.edu |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}} One of the main issues with refugee employment is that there is simply not enough time or money to support a thorough job search. The time allotted for support is eight months, however, the paper quoted above claimed that in reality the support lasts six months or less. This lack of time and funding results in a push for quick, insufficient employment rather than full, sustaining careers.

Refugees are pushed toward short-term jobs, simply to get them employed. This ignores individual refugees abilities, past education, and professional experience. The reason behind this push is that the goal is not that of long-term self-sustainability, but rather of self-sustainability by the end of the "eight"-month refugee assistance.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;{{rp|25}} The result is that the program turns into a machine bent on churning out integrated refugees. This method is inefficient because more refugees must then rely on the government over the long-term through welfare programs.

These short-term jobs have above minimum wage pay, but the average wage per hour for full-time workers obtained by refugees within four months of arrival was $8.67 in 2009.&lt;ref name="GAO-11-369"&gt;U.S. Government Accountability Office, [http://gao.gov/assets/320/317300.pdf Refugee Assistance: Little Is Known about the Effectiveness of Different Approaches for Improving Refugees’ Employment Outcomes], GAO-11-369 (Washington, DC: Government Accountability Office, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} This rate is insufficient for refugees who provide for their families. Many face eviction and eventual unemployment.&lt;ref name="Bruno"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41570.pdf|format=PDF|title=U.S. Refugee Resettlement Assistance|author=Andorra Bruno|date=January 4, 2011|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} This quick employment issue greatly affects the refugees’ ability to be self-sustaining."&lt;ref name="GAO-11-369"/&gt;{{rp|20}} In fiscal year 2007, ORR’s performance data show that between 59 percent and 65 percent of all refugees receiving cash assistance from ORR’s four assistance programs entered employment within 4 to 8 months of coming to the United States. There are mechanisms in place to allow for refugees to transfer their professional degrees; however, these transfers require recertification that costs as much as $1,000.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;{{rp|24}}

===English language===
If a refugee cannot speak English, their job possibilities decrease. "The ability to speak English can greatly facilitate a refugee’s chances of finding employment."&lt;ref name="GAO-11-369"/&gt;{{rp|27}} USRAP does provide English language classes. There is, however, a wide array of problems with these classes: inadequate facilities, no longevity, poor teacher quality, and lack of transportation to classes.&lt;ref name="GAO-11-369"/&gt;{{rp|27}}

Because of these issues, most refugees are not getting the English language training they need to achieve self-sustainability. The literature focused mainly on the problems with facilities and transportation.

According to Table 2, 58 percent of the incoming refugees could not speak English. This indicates that there is a great need for English language training among the refugees.

[[File:USRAPTABLE2.JPG|thumb|Table 2.&lt;ref name="Bruno"/&gt;{{rp|20–21}} Data for 1982 and 1986 are limited to Southeast Asian refugees. Data are averages for these years.]]

Because of the large percentage of refugees that need English classes, facilities are not expansive enough to cover the need.&lt;ref name="Bruno"/&gt;{{rp|20–21}} As stated above, another barrier to English acquisition is the lack of transport to classes. Because refugees do not have a way to get to the classes, they do not go to the classes and thus they do not learn English.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;{{rp|23}} "Limited funding means training provision typically stops at English language training during the early resettlement period".&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;{{rp|13}} This correlates directly with the refugee’s ability to obtain employment. Approximately 90 percent of refugees who were living on government welfare programs did not speak English.&lt;ref name="GAO-11-369"/&gt;{{rp|27}}

===Health care===
In addition to employment assistance, USRAP is also responsible for the health, both mental and physical, of refugees entering the United States. According to our bylaws, refugee resettlement agencies are "...&amp;nbsp;authorized to fund social services projects designed to provide, where specific needs have been shown and recognized by the Director, health (including mental health) services, social services, educational and other services."&lt;ref&gt;Immigration and Nationality Act 8 U.S.C. § 1522(c)(1)(A) (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

This responsibility becomes a problem when a high percentage of entering refugees have health issues. As the literature points out, this is a growing reality for the United States, "The number of refugees with chronic untreated medical and mental health conditions continues to grow. Needy refugees who do not qualify for Medicaid are limited to up to eight months of Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA)."&lt;ref name="Bruno"/&gt;{{rp|20}} There are reasons for why so many refugees suffer from poor mental and physical health:

Because the United States has admitted an increased number of refugees who have spent many years living in difficult conditions, such as refugee camps, a larger proportion of recently arrived refugees have health and other issues that make it difficult for them to work and achieve self-sufficiency. Because of these changes in refugee populations, [resettlement programs] faced difficulties in estimating the costs of serving newly arrived refugees, which, in turn, has affected the agency’s unobligated balances.&lt;ref name="GAO-11-369"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

Mental health issues are also on the rise because of the high number of Iraqi refugees being admitted to the United States. For whatever reason, Iraqi refugees have per capita higher instances of trauma and mental illness than other refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Government Accountability Office, IRAQ: Iraqi Refugees and Special Immigrant Visa Holders Face Challenges Resettling in the United States and Obtaining U.S. Government Employment, GAO-10-274 (Washington, DC: Government Accountability Office, 2011)|pages=1–2|url=http://gao.gov/assets/310/301555.pdf|format=PDF|website=Gao.gov|accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one article posited, this rise in mental illness among refugees calls for better training for psychologists in working with diverse populations: "The diversity of the refugee population in the United States requires practicing psychologists to respond by adapting clinical services to meet their mental health needs."&lt;ref&gt;Jessica A. Kaczorowski, et al.,"Adapting Clinical Services To Accommodate Needs of Refugee Populations" Professional Psychology: Research and Practice 42, no. 5 (2011): 361, DOI: 10.1037/a0025022&lt;/ref&gt; Hopefully with better training, psychologists of refugees will be able to better address their specific health needs. USRAP has an obligation to improve health services for the incoming refugee population.

==Current issues==
===U.S. foreign policy issues===
At times, [[United States foreign policy]] has had negative implications for the lives of the refugees USRAP aims to serve. Although official United States procedure states that foreign policy should have no impact on refugee admissions, this has not always been the case.&lt;ref name="Waibsnaider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4190&amp;context=flr |format=PDF |date=2006 |title=How National Self-Interest and Foreign Policy Continue To Influence the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program |author=Meital Waibsnaider |website=Ir.lawsuit.fordham.edu |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|393}} For example, on September 11, 2001, a number of Afghan refugees were scheduled to arrive in the United States. Not surprisingly, those plans did not move forward.&lt;ref name="Waibsnaider"/&gt;{{rp|391}} Particularly troubling are the patterns displayed early after the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. During this period, the United States greatly reduced the number of refugees admitted from both of these locations. This course of action (as one writer claims) was likely used to portray that the conditions in Afghanistan and Iraq "[were] improving."&lt;ref name="Waibsnaider"/&gt;{{rp|392–393}}

This use of refugee admissions programs to further national interests is, unfortunately, not uncommon. Legislation regarding refugee admissions written after World War II excluded large numbers of refugees (including ninety percent of Jewish refugees) from being eligible for resettlement in the United States.&lt;ref name="Waibsnaider"/&gt;{{rp|395}} This treatment was justified by some because of fears concerning the refugees’ possible impacts on the American economy.&lt;ref name="Waibsnaider"/&gt;{{rp|395}} During the Cold War, the United States used refugee admissions policy largely as a propaganda tool in an attempt to discredit communism by granting asylum to those seeking to escape communist nations.&lt;ref name="Waibsnaider"/&gt;{{rp|395–396}}

However, the interplay between United States refugee admissions and foreign policy is not entirely one-sided. A 2012 USRAP report to Congress states that United States involvement in discussions and actions concerning refugee resettlement have given the United States the opportunity to advance human-rights as well as influence other countries to be more open to accepting refugees.&lt;ref name="admissions_2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/181378.pdf |format=PDF |title=PROPOSED REFUGEE ADMISSIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012 |website=State.gov |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The example given in the report is that of [[Bhutanese refugees]]. Because the United States offered resettlement, other countries demonstrated a greater willingness to accept refugees as well.&lt;ref name="admissions_2012"/&gt;

===Local government issues===
Along with its foreign policy problems, the literature points out that USRAP has had issues with its domestic policies as well. A report, ''Abandoned Upon Arrival: Implications for Refugees and Local Communities Burdened by a U.S. Resettlement System That is not Working'', points out that local communities have confronted many challenges due to refugees resettlement. In the study, seven main findings were reported concerning the local resettlement communities.

First, the federal government uses "faith-based groups," for refugee placement.&lt;ref name="abandoned"&gt;Report to members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, ''[http://lugar.senate.gov/issues/foreign/refugee/report.pdf Abandoned Upon Arrival: Implications for Refugees and Local Communities Burdened by a U.S. Resettlement System That is Not Working]'', 111th Cong., 2d sess., (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} The local communities that receive the refugees are not included in the decision-making process. Receiving new refugees into a community requires numerous resources from the local government, but these local governments are not given enough funding from the federal government. They are also not informed as to how many new refugees they are going to receive. This has been a heavy burden for the local governments.

Second, the refugees’ language barriers, caused by lack of adequate language instruction, prevent the refugees from communicating effectively concerning important issues such as health. USDHS conducted a study in 2008, showing that the better language skills refugees have, the better outcomes they obtain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lewin.com/~/media/Lewin/Site_Sections/Publications/3871.pdf ]{{dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, the local school administrators are frustrated that the poor performance of the new refugee students negatively affects the school’s reputation. These schools are also upset that the government does not provide additional funding to assist or improve this situation.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Fourth, regardless of each refugee’s situation in regards to education, health, or psychological background, the government has applied a "one-size-fits-all assistance" approach.&lt;ref name="abandoned"/&gt;{{rp|9}} This impedes the local governments’ ability to accommodate the refugees according to their needs, and to prepare or teach them in areas that they are weak.

Fifth, while the Federal Government has increased funding for refugees, this does not fix the current problems. The extra money only creates a delaying effect on "the incidence of poverty."&lt;ref name="abandoned"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

Sixth, insufficient funding after initial support for resettlement has created a difficult economic climate for the local communities. Also, the fundamental structure to support the refugee program has not been proven effective.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Seventh, the federal government has established an ineffective resettlement system that imposes burdens on local governments. The current resettlement system not only is a burden, but also inhibits services for other refugees who have already been resettled.

In order to help the cities and refugees with these problems, this study suggests seven strategies for improvement: (1) ensure the local leaders involvement in decision making processes, (2) provide better language courses, (3) establishing strategies in education, (4) remove "one-size-fits-all assistance", (5) improve accountability, (6) search for innovative models, and (7) promote community engagement.&lt;ref name="abandoned"/&gt;{{rp|4–6}}

===Administrative issues===
Program fragmentation and lack of cohesion among different agencies produces challenges unnecessary burdens for those who are intended to benefit from the program.{{how|date=September 2016}}

====Failure to share information====
Many of these problems associated with USRAP begin with a lack of information sharing between the agencies involved.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;{{rp|36}} Much of the information gathered from refugees is not shared between agencies to ensure that the placement meets the needs of the refugee. For the most part, this information is only used to assess refugee admissibility into the resettlement program. At no point during the resettlement process does a government employee or contracted party have the responsibility to investigate and report "the presence of a needs-related vulnerability for the purposes of ensuring post-arrival assistance. Instead, such information is only gathered to help support the individual’s persecution claim."&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;{{rp|38}}

Similarly, medical examinations and interviews of refugees performed by the USCIS overseas are not used to determine the health and resettlement needs of the refugee. Rather, this information is used to assess the admissibility of the refugee.&lt;ref name="Kerwin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Donald Kerwin |year=2012 |title=The faltering U.S. refugee protection system: legal and policy responses to refugees, asylum-seekers, and others in need of protection |journal=Refugee Survey Quarterly |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=1–33 |doi=10.1093/rsq/hdr019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} In fact, resettlement agencies must make placement decisions before they even receive the medical records of refugees.&lt;ref name="Kerwin"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

One of the most crucial factors to the success of refugees is where they are placed in United States.&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;{{rp|10}} Even though the most vulnerable populations are being targeted for resettlement, these vulnerabilities are not being communicated to the placing agencies.&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;{{rp|11}} No structured system exists in USRAP for the collecting and distributing of refugee information for planning purposes.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;{{rp|41}} This failure to share information down the resettlement chain hurts the resettled refugees and the success of USRAP.

====Failure to coordinate/monitor refugees====
Because critical information is not always considered when a placement decision is made, it is not surprising that many refugees leave the locations of original placement to look for better opportunities elsewhere. In many instances, refugees will seek out communities of fellow country-of-origin nationals.&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Current legislation recognizes this secondary migration as a "natural and expected phenomenon."&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;{{rp|16}} However, there are no tools or tracking system in place to manage this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;{{rp|16}} USRAP takes no measures in anticipating foreseeable trends in secondary migration by refugees.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;{{rp|35}} When refugees move, they get lost in the system and their federal assistance money does not follow them. Consequently, these secondary migration refugees lose out on a part of their eight months of cash and medical treatment.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

==Recommendations==
The current literature offers many recommendations to improve the administration of USRAP. An information sharing mechanism could be instituted since none currently exists.&lt;ref name="Bruno"/&gt;{{rp|21}} The PRM needs to expand the information it provides to placing agencies so that refugees have a better chance to be relocated in an area that will offer them the best possible care and services.&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;{{rp|43}} It has also been suggested that refugees be consulted on decisions that affect them so that services and placement can be tailored to their needs.&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;{{rp|15}}

In addition, more than one article recommended that USRAP identify one lead agency to coordinate all the agencies and organizations involved in the program.&lt;ref name="Bruno"/&gt;{{rp|21}}&lt;ref name="Georgetown"/&gt;{{rp|43}} This agency could then monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of the program and establish consistent policies and procedures in the resettlement process.&lt;ref name="Bruno"/&gt;{{rp|21}} This renovated system should be flexible enough to account for secondary migration.&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;{{rp|16}} Refugees should not be penalized with a loss of federal assistance just because they exercise their right to relocate.&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

{{Close Relationships}}
A '''wife''' is a [[female]] [[Significant other|partner]] in a continuing [[marital relationship]].

The term continues to be applied to a woman who has separated from her partner, and ceases to be applied to such a woman only when her marriage has come to an end, following a legally recognized [[divorce]] or the death of her spouse. On the death of her partner, a wife is referred to as a [[widow]], but not after she is divorced from her partner.

The rights and obligations of a wife in relation to her partner and her status in the community and in law vary between cultures and have varied over time.

==Summary==
[[Image:Wedding and Engagement Rings 2151px.jpg|thumbnail|A [[white gold]] [[wedding ring]] and a single-[[diamond]], [[gold]]-banded engagement ring. In many cultures, wives show their marital status through various symbols.]]
The word is of Germanic origin, from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''wībam'', "woman". In [[Middle English]] it had the form ''wif'', and in Old English ''wīf'', "[[woman]] or wife". It is related to Modern [[German language|German]] ''Weib'' (woman, female),&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaer27.uni-trier.de/CLL/Frouwe/weib.html Etymology of "Weib"] (broken link to a uni personal account)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Danish language|Danish]] ''viv'' (wife, usually poetic) and may derive ultimately from the Indo-European root ''ghwībh-'' "shame; pudenda" (cf. [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] B ''kwīpe'' and Tocharian A ''kip'', each meaning "female pudenda", with clear sexual overtones).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4IHbQgz1nZYC&amp;dq=american+heritage+indo-european+roots&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kqRjTOfLCIbvcMyjxJYF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Watkins, ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'', p. 32.]&lt;/ref&gt; The original meaning of the phrase "wife" as simply "woman", unconnected with marriage or a husband/wife, is preserved in words such as "[[midwife]]" and "[[fishmonger|fishwife]]".

In many cultures, marriage is generally expected that a woman will take her husband's [[surname]], though that is not universal. A married woman may indicate her [[marital status]] in a number of ways: in [[Western culture]] a married woman would commonly wear a [[wedding ring]] but in other cultures other [[Visual markers of marital status|markers of marital status]] may be used. A married woman is commonly given the [[honorific]] title "[[Mrs]]", but some married women prefer to be referred to as "[[Ms.|Ms]]", a title which is also used when the marital status of a woman is unknown.

==Related terminology==
[[File:Bride at Nikah.jpg|thumb|A young bride at her [[Nikah]].]]
A woman on her wedding day is usually described as a ''[[bride]]'', even after the ''[[wedding]] ceremony'', while being described as a wife is also appropriate after the wedding or after the honeymoon. Her partner is known as the ''[[groom|bridegroom]]'' during the wedding, and within the marriage is called her ''[[husband]]''.

In the older custom, still followed, e. g., by Roman Catholic ritual&lt;!-- and elsewhere !--&gt;, the word ''bride'' actually means [[fiancée]] and applies up to the exchange of matrimonial consent (the actual marriage act); from then on, even while the rest of the very ceremony is ongoing, the woman is a wife, and no longer a bride, and the bridal couple is no longer referred to as such but as the newlywed couple.

"Wife" refers to the institutionalized relation ''to the other spouse'', unlike [[mother]], a term that puts a woman into the context of her children. In some societies, especially historically, a ''[[concubine]]'' was a woman who was in an ongoing, usually matrimonially oriented relationship with a man who could not be married to her, often because of a difference in social status.

The term ''wife'' is most commonly applied to a woman in a union sanctioned by law (including [[religious law]]), not to a woman in an informal [[cohabitation]] relationship, which may be known as a girlfriend, partner, cohabitant, significant other, [[concubine]], [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] etc. However, a woman in a so-called [[common law marriage]] may describe herself as a common law wife, de facto wife, or simply a wife.  Those seeking to advance [[gender neutrality]] may refer to both marriage partners as "spouses", and many countries and societies are rewording their statute law by replacing "wife" and "husband" with "spouse". A former wife whose spouse is deceased is a ''[[widow]]''.

==Termination of the status of a wife==
The status of a wife may be terminated by [[divorce]], [[annulment]], or the [[death]] of a spouse. In the case of divorce, terminology such as ''former-wife'' or ''ex-wife'' is often used. With regard to annulment, such terms are not, strictly speaking, correct, because annulment, unlike divorce, is usually [[ex post facto law|retroactive]], meaning that an annulled marriage is considered to be invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place. In the case of the death of the other spouse, the term used is [[widow]]. The social status of such women varies by culture, but in some places, they may be subject to potentially harmful practices, such as [[widow inheritance]] or [[levirate marriage]]; or divorced women may be socially stigmatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26356373|title=India's invisible widows, divorcees and single women|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, the termination of the status of wife made life itself meaningless, as in the case of those cultures that practiced [[Sati (practice)|sati]], a [[funeral]] ritual within some [[Asia]]n communities, in which a recently widowed woman [[Self-immolation|committed suicide by fire]], typically on the husband's [[funeral pyre]].

==Legal rights of the wife==
{{Further|Coverture|Marital power}}
The legal rights of a wife have been since the 19th century, and still are, in many jurisdictions subject to debate. This subject was in particular addressed by [[John Stuart Mill]], in ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869). Historically, many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to husbands that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to wives. In particular, the control of marital property, inheritance rights, and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage, have typically been given to male marital partners. However, this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century, and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender.  Among the last European countries to establish full [[gender equality]] in marriage were Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;In 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450][http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html] The new reforms came into force in January 1988.''Women's movements of the world: an international directory and reference guide, edited by Sally Shreir'', p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; Greece,&lt;ref&gt;In 1983, legislation was passed guaranteeing equality between spouses, abolishing [[dowry]], and ending legal discrimination against illegitimate children [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html#]''Demos, Vasilikie. (2007) “The Intersection of Gender, Class and Nationality and the Agency of Kytherian Greek Women.” Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association. August 11''.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;In 1981, Spain abolished the requirement that married women must have their husbands’ permission to initiate judicial proceedings {{cite web|url=http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824032832/http://wbl.worldbank.org/~/media/FPDKM/WBL/Documents/Reports/2014/Women-Business-and-the-Law-2014-Key-Findings.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and France&lt;ref&gt;Although married women in France obtained the right to work without their husbands' permission in 1965,{{cite web|url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092212/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/explore/cmcf-vsi-women-in-france.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} and the paternal authority of a man over his family was ended in 1970 (before that parental responsibilities belonged to the father who made all legal decisions concerning the children), it was only in 1985 that a legal reform abolished the stipulation that the husband had the sole power to administer the children's property. [http://ceflonline.net/wp-content/uploads/France-Parental-Responsibilities.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1980s. In various [[marriage laws]] around the world, however, the husband continues to have authority; for instance the Civil Code of [[Iran]] states at Article 1105: ''"In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311161504/http://www.alaviandassociates.com/documents/civilcode.pdf |archive-date=2017-03-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exchanges of goods or money==
[[Image:Thai Bride Price 2008.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional, formal presentation of the [[bride price]] at a [[Thailand|Thai]] engagement ceremony.]] 
Traditionally, and still in some parts of the world, the bride or her family bring her husband a ''[[dowry]]'', or the husband or his family pay a ''[[bride price]]'' to the bride's family, or both are exchanged between the families; or the husband pays the wife a ''[[dower]]''. The purpose of the dowry varies by culture and has varied historically. In some cultures, it was paid not only to support the establishment of a new family, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, the dowry had to be returned to the wife or her family; but during the marriage, the dowry was often made [[inalienable right|inalienable]] by the husband.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2005, ''dowry''&lt;/ref&gt; Today, dowries continue to be expected in parts of [[South Asia]] such as India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, and conflicts related to their payment sometimes result in violence such as [[dowry deaths]] and [[bride burning]].

==Changing of name upon marriage==
{{Main|Maiden and married names}}
In some cultures, particularly in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] [[Western world|West]], wives often change their surnames to that of the husband upon getting married. For some, this is a controversial practice, due to its tie to the historical doctrine of [[coverture]] and to the historically subordinated roles of wives. Others argue that today this is merely a harmless tradition that should be accepted as a free choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29804450|title=Why should women change their names on getting married?|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions consider this practice as discriminatory and contrary to women's rights, and have restricted or banned it; for example, since 1983, when [[Greece]] adopted a new [[marriage law]] which guaranteed [[gender equality]] between the spouses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html#|title=AROUND THE WORLD; Greece Approves Family Law Changes|first=|last=Reuters|date=26 January 1983|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; women in Greece are required to ''keep'' their birth names for their whole life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/06/women-change-name-after-marriage-greece|title=Should women change their names after marriage? Ask a Greek woman - Heather Long|author=Heather Long|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childbearing==
[[File:Non marital by countries.gif|350 px|thumb|Percentage of births to unmarried women, selected countries, 1980 and 2007.&lt;ref name="non_mar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db18.htm|title=Changing Patterns of Nonmarital Childbearing in the United States |work=CDC/National Center for Health Statistics|date=May 13, 2009|accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Traditionally, and still in many cultures, the role of a wife was closely tied to that of a [[mother]], by a strong expectation that a wife ought to bear children, while, conversely, an unmarried woman should not have a [[Legitimacy (family law)|child out of wedlock]]. These views have changed in many parts of the world. Children born outside marriage have become more common in many countries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Although some wives in particular in Western countries [[Childfree|choose not to have children]], such a choice is not accepted in some parts of the world. In [[northern Ghana]], for example, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control are at risk of threats and coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women’s fears and men’s anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] on behalf of the [[Population Council]] | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some religions are interpreted as requiring children in marriage; for instance [[Pope Francis]] said in 2015 that choosing not to have children was "selfish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/11/pope-francis-the-choice-to-not-have-children-is-selfish|title=Pope Francis: not having children is selfish|author=Stephanie Kirchgaessner|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences in cultures==
{{Hatnote|The various divisions of the following chapters share the previous terminology in [[English language]], notwithstanding religious and cultural, but also customary differences.}}

===Antiquity===
[[File:Seuso and his wife at Lake Balaton.jpg|thumb|Seuso and his wife]]
Many traditions like a dower, dowry and bride price have long traditions in antiquity. The exchange of any item or value goes back to the oldest sources, and the wedding ring likewise was always used as a symbol for keeping faith to a person.

===Christianity===

====Historical status====
Christian cultures claim to be guided by the [[New Testament]] in regard to their view on the position of a wife in society as well as her marriage. For example, the New Testament condemns divorce for both men and women (1 Cor 7:10–11), and assumes [[monogamy]] on the part of the husband: the woman is to have her "own" husband, and the husband was to have his "own" wife (1 Cor 7:2). In medieval Christianity, this was understood to mean that a wife should not share a husband with other wives. As a result, divorce was relatively uncommon in the pre-modern West, particularly in the medieval and [[early modern period]], and husbands in the Roman, later medieval and early modern period did not publicly take more than one wife.

In pre-modern times, it was unusual to marry for love alone,&lt;ref&gt;William C. Horne, Making a heaven of hell: the problem of the companionate ideal in English marriage, poetry, 1650–1800 Athens (Georgia), 1993&lt;/ref&gt; although it became an ideal in literature by the early modern period.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Burney, Evelina, Lowndes 1778, and Seeber, English Literary History of the Eighteenth Century, Weimar 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Roman law required brides to be at least 12 years old, a standard adopted by Catholic [[canon law]]. In Roman law, first marriages to brides aged 12–25 required the consent of the bride and her father, but by the late antique period Roman law permitted women over 25 to marry without parental consent.&lt;ref&gt;Anti Arjava, ''Women and Law in Late Antiquity'' Oxford, 1996, pp. 29–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Testament allows a widow to marry any Christian she chooses (1 Cor 7:39). In the 12th century, the Catholic Church drastically changed legal standards for marital consent by allowing daughters over 12 and sons over 14 to marry without their parents' approval, even if their marriage was made clandestinely.&lt;ref&gt;John Noonan, "The Power to Choose" '' Viator'' 4 (1973) 419–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Parish studies have confirmed that late medieval women did sometimes marry against their parents' approval.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sheehan, "The formation and stability of marriage in fourteenth century England" ''Medieval Studies'' 33 (1971) 228–63.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church's policy of considering clandestine marriages and marriages made without parental consent to be valid was controversial, and in the 16th century both the French monarchy and the Lutheran church sought to end these practices, with limited success.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Gottlieb, ''The family in the Western World from the Black Death to the Industrial Age'' Oxford, 1993, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament made no pronouncements about wives' property rights, which in practice were influenced more by secular laws than religion. Most influential in the pre-modern West was the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], except in English-speaking countries where English [[common law]] emerged in the High Middle Ages. In addition, local customary law influenced wives' property rights; as a result wives' property rights in the pre-modern West varied widely from region to region. Because wives' property rights and daughters' inheritance rights varied widely from region to region due to differing legal systems, the amount of property a wife might own varied greatly. Under Roman law, daughters inherited equally from their parents if no will was produced,&lt;ref&gt;Antti Arjava, ''Women and law in late antiquity'' Oxford, 1996, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; under the English common law system, which dates to the later medieval period, daughters and younger sons were usually excluded from landed property if no will was produced. In addition, Roman law recognized wives' property as legally separate from husbands's property,&lt;ref&gt;A. Arjava, ''Women and law in late antiquity'' Oxford, 1996, 133-154.&lt;/ref&gt; as did some legal systems in parts of Europe and colonial Latin America. In contrast, English common law moved to a system where a wife with a living husband ("feme couvert") could own little property in her own name.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth M. Craik, Marriage and property, Aberdeen 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to easily support herself, marriage was very important to most women's economic status. This problem has been dealt with extensively in literature, where the most important reason for women's limited power was the denial of equal education and equal property rights for females.&lt;ref&gt;In the 18th and 19th centuries, which contained much criticism of these facts, see also [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[A Vindication of the Rights of Women]], [[Boston]] 1792&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was assessed by the English conservative moralist Sir [[William Blackstone]]: "The husband and wife are one, and the husband is the one."&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone, Commentaries upon the Laws of England&lt;/ref&gt; Married women's property rights in the English-speaking world improved with the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]] and similar legal changes, which allowed wives with living husbands to own property in their own names. Until late in the 20th century, women could in some regions or times sue a man for [[wreath money]] when he took her [[virginity]] without taking her as his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhaus 2004, ''Kranzgeld''.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a woman did not want to marry, another option was entering a [[convent]] as a [[nun]].&lt;ref&gt;Though cloisters' practices were not bound by modern national borders, see sources [https://web.archive.org/web/20060301163747/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_3_33/ai_61372238 for Spain], [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_womens_history/v014/14.3mcgough.html for Italy], and [http://www.ianpaisley.org/article.asp?ArtKey=family for Britain]&lt;/ref&gt; to become a "[[bride of Christ]]",&lt;ref name="Taking The White Veil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jesus-messiah.com/charlotte/html/white-veil.html|title=The White Veil|website=jesus-messiah.com|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state in which her chastity and economic survival would be protected.&lt;ref name="Taking The White Veil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04060a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Cloister|work=newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both a wife and a nun wore veils, which proclaimed their state of protection by the rights of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Evangelisti, Wives, Widows, And Brides Of Christ: Marriage And The Convent In The Historiography Of Early Modern Italy, [http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=5618 Cambridge 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Much more significant than the option of becoming a nun, was the option of non-religious spinsterhood in the West. As first demonstrated quantitatively by John Hajnal, in the 19th and early 20th centuries the percentage of non-clerical Western women who never married was typically as high as 10–15%, a prevalence of female celibacy never yet documented for any other major traditional civilization.&lt;ref&gt;John Hajnal, "European marriage patterns in perspective" in D.E. Glass and D.E.C. Eversley eds. ''Population in History'' London, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, early modern Western women married at quite high ages (typically mid to late 20s) relative to other major traditional cultures. The high age at first marriage for Western women has been shown by many parish reconstruction studies to be a traditional Western marriage pattern that dates back at least as early as the mid-16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Flynn, ''The European Demographic System, 1500-1820'' Johns Hopkins, 1981, pp. 124–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary status====
In the 20th century, the role of the wife in Western marriage changed in two major ways; the first was the breakthrough from an "institution to companionate marriage";&lt;ref&gt;"Companionship marriage" and "companionate marriage" are synonyms (the latter being the older one), although the term usually refers to a relationship based on equality, it might instead refer to a marriage with mutual interest in their children, {{cite web |url=http://www.futureofchildren.org/information2827/information_show.htm?doc_id=290368 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712030304/http://www.futureofchildren.org/information2827/information_show.htm?doc_id=290368 |archivedate=2007-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time, wives became distinct [[legal entities]], and were allowed their own property and allowed to sue. Until then, partners were a single legal entity, but only a husband was allowed to exercise this right. The second change was the drastic alteration of middle and upper-class family life, when in the 1960s these wives began to work outside their home, and with the social acceptance of [[divorce]]s the single-parent family, and [[stepfamily]] or "blended family" as a more "individualized marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futureofchildren.org/information2827/information_show.htm?doc_id=290368|title=Stepfamily as individualized marriage|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712030304/http://www.futureofchildren.org/information2827/information_show.htm?doc_id=290368|archivedate=12 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, a woman may wear a [[wedding ring]] in order to show her status as a wife.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Vicki. "A 'Real Man's Ring': Gender and the Invention of Tradition." ''Journal of Social History''. Summer 2003 pp. 837–856&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western countries today&lt;!--like the [[United Kingdom]] pro KEEP:source from that area, pro HIDE: Source underlines Western tradition exemplified by a uk, non-national source--&gt;, married women usually have an [[education]], a [[profession]] and they (or their husbands) can take time off from their work in a legally procured system of [[ante-natal care]], statutory [[maternity leave]], and they may get [[maternity pay]] or a maternity [[allowance (money)|allowance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Employment/Employees/WorkAndFamilies/DG_10026556|title=Pregnant employees' rights|work=direct.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of marriage, as opposed to unmarried pregnant women, allows the [[spouse]] to be responsible for the child, and to speak on behalf of their wife; a partner is also responsible for the wife's child in states where they are automatically assumed to be the biological legal parent.&lt;ref&gt;Cuckoo's egg in the nest, Spiegel 07, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Vice versa, a wife has more legal authority in some cases when she speaks on behalf of a spouse than she would have if they were not married, e.g. when her spouse is in a coma after an accident, a wife may have the right of advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;The restrictions of her abilities to do this vary immensely even within a legal system, see [http://www.seniorlaw.com/fishman.htm case NY vs. Fishman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220202903/http://www.seniorlaw.com/fishman.htm |date=2007-02-20 }}, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; If they [[divorce]], she also might receive—or pay—[[alimony]] (see [[Law and divorce around the world]]).

===Islam===
[[Women in Islam]] have a range of rights and obligations (see main article [[Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam]]). Marriage takes place on the basis of a [[Islamic marriage contract|marriage contract]]. The [[arranged marriage]] is relatively common in traditionalist families, whether in Muslim countries or as first or second generation immigrants elsewhere.

Women in general are supposed to wear specific clothes, as stated by the [[hadith]], like the [[hijab]], which may take different styles depending on the culture of the country, where traditions may seep in.{{Quran-usc|24|31}}{{Quran-usc|33|59}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novq12y1.html|title=Clothes|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924085957/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novq12y1.html|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The husband must pay a ''[[mahr]]'' to the bride, which is similar to the [[dower]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]] verse 4;4&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the wife in Islam is seen as a protected, chaste person that manages the household and the family. She has the ever important role of raising the children and bringing up the next generation of Muslims. In Islam, it is highly recommended that the wife remains at home although they are fully able to own property or work. The husband is obligated to spend on the wife for all of her needs while she is not obligated to spend even if she is wealthy. [[Muhammad]] is said to have commanded all Muslim men to treat their wives well. There is a Hadith by [[Al-Tirmidhi]], in which Muhammad is said to have stated "The believers who show the most perfect faith are those who have the best character and the best of you are those who are best to their wives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.al-islam.org/women-islam-versus-women-judaeo-christian-tradition-myth-reality-sherif-muhammad-abdel-azeem/divorce |title=Divorce |work=Women In Islam Versus Women In The Judaeo-Christian Tradition: The Myth &amp; The Reality |accessdate=August 6, 2018 |first=Sherif Muhammad |last=Abdel Azeem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Muslim married women are not distinguished from unmarried women by an outward symbol (such as a wedding ring). However, women's wedding rings have recently been adopted in the past thirty years from the Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zawaj.com/articles/westernized.html|title=ZAWAJ.COM: Articles and Essays About Marriage in Islam|work=zawaj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In [[Indo-Aryan languages]], a wife is known as ''Patni'', which means a woman who shares everything in this world with her husband and he does the same, including their identity. Decisions are ideally made in mutual consent. A wife usually takes care of anything inside her household, including the family's health, the children's education, a parent's needs.

The majority of Hindu marriages in rural and traditional India are arranged marriages. Once they find a suitable family (family of same caste, culture and financial status), the boy and the girl see and talk to each other to decide the final outcome. In recent times however the western culture has had significant influence and the new generations are more open to the idea of marrying for love.

Indian law has recognized  rape, sexual, emotional or verbal abuse of a woman by her husband as crimes. 
In [[Hinduism]], a wife is known as a ''Patni'' or ''Ardhangini'' (similar to "the better half") meaning a part of the husband or his family. In Hinduism, a woman or man can get married, but only have one husband or wife respectively.

In India, women may wear vermillion powder on their foreheads, an ornament called Mangalsutra (Hindi मंगलसूत्र ) which is a form of necklace, or rings on their toes (which are not worn by single women) to show their status as married women.

===Buddhism and Chinese folk religions===
[[China]]'s family laws were changed by the [[Communist]] revolution; and in 1950, the [[People's Republic of China]] enacted a comprehensive marriage law including provisions giving the spouses equal rights with regard to ownership and management of marital property.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2004, ''Legal limitations on marriage (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], before enactment of the [[Meiji Constitution|Meiji]] Civil Code of 1898, all of the woman's property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Britannica, ''Legal limitations on marriage (from family law)''&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Women in Japan]], [[Law of Japan]]

==Expectation of fidelity and violence related to adultery==

There is a widely held expectation, which has existed for most of recorded history and in most cultures, that a wife is not to have [[sexual relation]]s with anyone other than her legal husband. A breach of this expectation of [[fidelity]] is commonly referred to as [[adultery]] or [[extramarital sex]]. Historically, adultery has been considered to be a serious [[offense (law)|offense]], sometimes a [[crime]], and even a [[sin]]. Even if that is not so, it may still have legal consequences, particularly as a ground for a [[divorce]]. Adultery may be a factor to consider in a [[property settlement]], it may affect the status of children, the [[custody of children]]; moreover, adultery can result in social [[ostracism]] in some parts of the world. 
In addition, [[Affinity (canon law)|affinity]] rules of the Christian Church, of Judaism and of Islam prohibit an ex-wife or widow from engaging in sexual relations with and from marrying a number of relatives of the former husband.

In parts of the world, adultery may result in violent acts, such as [[honor killings]] or [[stoning]]. Some jurisdictions, especially those that apply [[Sharia law]], allow for such acts to take place legally.

As of September 2010, stoning is a legal punishment in countries such as [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], [[Iran]], [[Yemen]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], and some states in [[Nigeria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Handley|first=Paul|title=Islamic countries under pressure over stoning|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ixvYN7oeF8ehN9beAHZ4G_YlfKeA|accessdate=22 April 2011|newspaper=AFP|date=11 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as punishment for [[Zina|zina al-mohsena]] ("adultery of married persons").&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Stoning|url=http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/faq_stoning|publisher=violence is not our culture|accessdate=14 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129025158/http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/faq_stoning|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
