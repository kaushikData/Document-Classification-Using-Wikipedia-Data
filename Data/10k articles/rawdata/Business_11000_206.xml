==Life==

He was born on 12 October 1816 in [[Edinburgh]], the son of [[Robert Bryson]] [[FRSE]] (1778-1852), a watchmaker, and Janet Gillespie (1788-1858). 

He attended the High School in Edinburgh then trained as a watchmaker and entered the family business, then renamed Robert Bryson &amp; Son.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

His first wife, Elizabeth Waterstone Gillespie (possibly a cousin) bore him two children who died in infancy, and a daughter and son ([[William Alexander Bryson]]) and died 10 April 1855 aged 44.

His second wife, Catherine McDonald Cuthbertson, also died young in September 1859, aged only 32, after bearing him another son.

His third wife, Jane Thomson, bore him another son, Leonard Horner Bryson, survived him and remarried.

He was President of the Royal Scottish Society of Antiquarians 1860-1861. He was President of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh in 1863. He was also a member of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh and the Edinburgh Geological Society.

In 1858 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. He was President of the [[Royal Scottish Society of the Arts]] 1860-61.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rssa.org.uk/history/past-presidents.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 7 December 1866 at  [[Hawkhill House]], a country villa between [[Leith]] and [[Edinburgh]]. He is buried in [[New Calton Cemetery]] with his two wives next to his parents.

The '''Biosciences Federation''' (BSF) was a [[United Kingdom]] body formed in 2002.

==Function==
The Federation aimed to unite the [[bioscience]] community over issues of common interest that related to both research and teaching. These organisations are a key component of the UK's [[knowledge economy]]. It also aimed to influence the formulation of UK policy relating to biosciences, and to promote public debate on ethical issues. Its interests were in using knowledge gained in research to benefit society, and the impact of legislation on the life sciences industry.

===Events===
Each November, it would hold the ''Life Sciences Careers Conference''.

==Structure==
During October 2009, the Biosciences Federation was merged with the [[Institute of Biology]] (IoB) to form the [[Society of Biology]] (which boasts some 80,000 members).&lt;ref&gt;[http://societyofbiology.org/newsandevents/news/view/19 - The IoB &amp; BSF merge to form the Society of Biology (5 October 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last president of the Federation was Dame [[Nancy Rothwell]] (2006–9); [[Richard Dyer (biologist)|Richard Dyer]], former director of the [[Babraham Institute]], was the chief executive officer (2006–9). Sir [[Tom Blundell]] was a former president (2004–6).

===Affiliated organisations in the federation===
From 2007, the Biosciences Federation encompassed 51 member or associated organisations that covered the entire range of life sciences; these included 
* [[Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry]]
* [[Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour]]
* [[AstraZeneca]]
* [[Biochemical Society]]
* [[British Andrology Society]]
* [[British Association for Psychopharmacology]]
* [[British Ecological Society]]
* [[British Neuroscience Association]]
* [[British Pharmacological Society]]
* [[British Society of Animal Science]]
* [[British Society for Cell Biology]]
* [[British Society for Developmental Biology]]
* [[British Society for Immunology]]
* [[British Society for Neuroendocrinology]]
* [[British Society for Proteome Research]]
* [[British Society for Medical Mycology]]
* [[British Toxicological Society]]
* [[Experimental Psychology Society]]
* [[Genetics Society]]
* [[Institute of Animal Technology]]
* [[Institute of Biology]]
* [[Institute of Horticulture]]
* [[Laboratory Animal Science Association]]
* [[Linnean Society]]
* [[Nutrition Society]]
* [[Physiological Society]]
* [[Royal Microscopical Society]]
* [[Society for Endocrinology]]
* [[Society for Applied Microbiology]]
* [[Society for Experimental Biology]]
* [[Society for General Microbiology]]
* [[UK Environmental Mutagen Society]]
* [[Zoological Society of London]]

==Activities==
The Federation responded to government consultations on biology-related issues; these responses were published on the Federation's website. It also distributed science policy news to a range of organisations that included universities, research councils, pharmaceutical companies and government bodies. The Federation hosted several life sciences careers conferences and symposia on issues such as [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] publishing. It also supported the annual award for scientific communication.

The '''Broadcasting Standards Authority''' ('''BSA'''; {{lang-mi|Te Mana Whanonga Kaipāho}}) is a [[New Zealand]] [[Crown entity]] created by the [[Broadcasting Act 1989]] to develop and uphold standards of broadcasting for radio, free-to-air and [[pay tv|pay television]]. 

The main functions of the BSA are:

* Develop and maintain codified broadcasting standards
* Operate a complaints procedure.

The BSA is made up of a board appointed for a fixed term by the [[Governor General]] on the advice of the [[Minister of Broadcasting]] meaning that practically the Minister of Broadcasting (and [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet]]) appoint the board. The chair is always a [[barrister]]. One member is appointed after consultation with broadcasters and one after consultation with public interest groups. 

Complaints regarding breaches of broadcasting standards can only be brought to the Authority after first being raised with the broadcaster. 

In March 2013 the Law Commission proposed moving complaints about news and current affairs out of the jurisdiction of the BSA, the Press Council and the Online Media Standards Authority, placing them under a proposed new body, the [[News Media Standards Authority]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/New-media-regulator-proposed/tabid/423/articleID/291809/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= New media regulator proposed| date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developers worked to maintain historical accuracy, including all the actual major space hardware and several alternative proposals that were considered at the time, but did make some compromises and simplifications in the name of [[game balance]] and avoiding complexity.&lt;ref name="desnotes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bronner|first=Fritz|title=Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space (manual)|publisher=Interplay Entertainment|location=[[Irvine, California]]|year=1992|ref=manual|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also consulted [[Apollo 11]] [[astronaut]] [[Buzz Aldrin]], who gave permission for his name to be used for the game.&lt;ref name ="bronner93_340"&gt;[[#bronner_1993|Bronner 1993]], p. 340&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space'' has two sides, the United States and the Soviet Union,&lt;ref name="compute_baris_oct93" /&gt; unlike ''[[LIFTOFF!]]'' which supported up to four (the other two sides in ''Liftoff!'' were Europe and Asia).&lt;ref&gt;[[#bronner_1993|Bronner 1993]], p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Each player controls a [[space center]], which doubles as a navigational menu, and directs funding toward purchasing hardware, [[research and development]], recruiting and training [[astronaut]]s, and conducting launches.&lt;ref name="compute_baris_oct93" /&gt;

While the ultimate goal of the game is to conduct a successful manned Moon landing, it is necessary to complete several milestone achievements to ensure success.&lt;ref name="compute_baris_oct93" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bronner_201-203"&gt;[[#bronner_1993|Bronner 1993]], pp. 201-203&lt;/ref&gt; Historical milestones in the game range from launching a [[satellite]],&lt;ref name="compute_baris_oct93" /&gt; like [[Sputnik 1]], to conducting a [[lunar orbit]]al mission, like [[Apollo 8]]. Skipping a milestone results in a safety penalty to any mission depending on it.&lt;ref name="bronner_201-203" /&gt; For example, skipping a manned lunar orbital mission would cause a safety penalty to all mission steps during a moon landing mission.&lt;ref name="bronner_265-6"&gt;[[#bronner_1993|Bronner 1993]], pp. 265-266&lt;/ref&gt;

Play begins in spring of 1957 and proceeds with turns lasting six months each for up to 20 years to the end of 1977,&lt;ref name="compute_baris_oct93" /&gt; or until the first player successfully conducts a manned Moon landing, or until one player is dismissed from his/her program (this happens rarely, and only to a human player who is essentially doing nothing). At the start of each turn, the game randomly chooses an "event card" to give the player, usually with a piece of historical information, and sometimes with positive or negative effects on the game.&lt;ref name="escapist_2" /&gt; For example, the player may be informed that [[Operation Paperclip]] has increased the effect of research and development for that turn.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bronner_1993|Bronner 1993]], p. 283-284&lt;/ref&gt;

On the way to the Moon landing, the two space programs compete for prestige in order to secure funding. Players gain prestige points through space exploration "firsts", which include historical milestone missions that improve lunar mission safety, but also ancillary achievements, such as the first Mars flyby (historically [[Mariner 4]]) or first [[List of female astronauts|woman in space]] (historically [[Valentina Tereshkova]]). The player to make the second successful mission of a certain type will typically gain some prestige points, whereas subsequent missions may earn very few or no points. Prestige points are lost through mission failures, especially those involving astronaut/cosmonaut fatalities.

The heart of the game is the space missions, which come down to [[dice]] rolls. At each step of a mission, the safety factor of the relevant component is checked against a random number, adjusted by relevant astronaut skill bonuses (if the mission is manned), safety penalties and other factors. If the check fails, an error occurs. Such an error may range from catastrophic mission failure down to no effect (e.g. "The first imprint in the lunar surface is in fact made by a helmet visor. Crewman okay."). Placing a satellite in orbit has three steps, while a moon landing can have well over twenty. Missions are generally non-interactive; occasionally during an incident, the player may be given the option of aborting or proceeding.

==History==

===Development===
While developing ''LIFTOFF!'' with [[Task Force Games]], Fritz Bronner had considered making a computer version, but did not find much interest within Task Force.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bronner_1993|Bronner 1993]], p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; As Task Force had not [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] the ''LIFTOFF!'' computer game when they were contractually able, Bronner decided to undertake the development independently. In November 1990 he met and recruited then 22-year-old Michael McCarty as programmer and formed Strategic Visions as a partnership, but concluded that publishing would be too daunting a task. They initially decided to program for [[Amiga]] and released a videotape demo on that platform in June 1991. However, by September they concluded that the Amiga market was shrinking and decided to change platforms to [[IBM PC compatible]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#bronner_1993|Bronner 1993]], pp. 337-338, 343&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1991, Strategic Visions signed with Interplay Entertainment to publish the game, with a projected release of May 1992. By this time, Buzz Aldrin was on the project in an advisory role. It was also around this time that Bronner added the feature of astronaut/cosmonaut skills and morale, which previously made no impact on the performance of a mission.&lt;ref name="cgw_jan92"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Staff |date=January 1992 |title=No More "Spam in a Can" |journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] |publisher=Golden Empire Publications |location=[[Anaheim, California]] |issue=90 |pages=48, 50 |issn=0744-6667 |oclc=8482876 |url=http://cgw.vintagegaming.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=90 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723104500/http://cgw.vintagegaming.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=90 |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronaut/cosmonaut skills were initially randomized at the start of each game.&lt;ref name ="bronner93_340" /&gt;

Strategic Visions and Interplay showed a demo of ''Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space'' at the 1992 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and also held a reception at [[Caesars Palace]] where Buzz Aldrin spoke about his experiences in the space program.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bronner_1993|Bronner 1993]], p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Software testing]] began in September 1992, which proved a daunting task: one tester calculated that with all mission types and hardware permutations factored in, there were over 12,000 possible missions. With failure modes factored in, this number increased to approximately 50 million possible mission outcomes.&lt;ref name="bronner93-3456"&gt;[[#bronner_1993|Bronner 1993]], pp. 345-346&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1993, the manual was the last major step delaying shipping. It took 2.5 weeks to design and another 6 weeks before it came back from the printers.

===Release===
In March 1993, ''Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space'' was ready to be released after a production which had lasted 28 months.&lt;ref name="bronner93-3456" /&gt;
The final floppy disk version had some 100&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte]]s of photographs and animations cut due to space limitations, and the then-planned modem play was cut as well. Immediately upon completion of the floppy version, however, work began on the CD-ROM version.&lt;ref name="bronner93-3456" /&gt; The CD-ROM version was produced by Interplay's Rusty Buchert, who also produced ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GAME FANS TAKE THE DESCENT|last=Brown |first=Lonnie| date=1995-04-29 |work=[[The Ledger]] |publisher=The Ledger Pub. Co. |page=1C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''BARIS'' was re-released in 1994 on [[CD-ROM]], incorporating the earlier updates to the [[floppy disk]] version, a few new updates, improved video of the mission launches,&lt;ref name="nov1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theage"/&gt; and new multiplayer modes.&lt;ref name="everything"/&gt;

=== Source code release ===
[[File:RIS screenshot v1.1.0.02 (pandora game port).png|thumb|Screenshot of the game's selection screen (v1.1.0.2 Pandora version).]]
In 2005, after the [[bankruptcy]] of publisher Interplay the developers released the game's  [[source code]] under a [[GPL]] license and the game's content as [[freeware]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070710110823/http://www.geocities.com/raceintospace/CopyrightInfo.txt CopyrightInfo.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting project, now called ''Race Into Space'', is hosted on [[Sourceforge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/raceintospace/ sourceforge.net/projects/raceintospace]&lt;/ref&gt; The game has now been [[Porting|ported]] to modern operating systems and additional platforms (for instance [[Pandora (console)|Pandora]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdroms.de/pandora/race-into-space-v1-1-0-02-pandora-game-port race-into-space-v1-1-0-02-pandora-game-port] (September 8, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;), with some improvements over the original. Development at SourceForge has ceased, and is continuing, slowly, now on [[GitHub]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/raceintospace raceintospace] on github.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager===
In October 2013, [[Slitherine Strategies]] released the first version of a game titled ''Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager''. The game focuses on research, development and mission planning, and shares many features with the original BARIS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slitherine.com/games/BA_SPM_Pc |title=Buzz Aldrin's Space Program Manager |publisher=Slitherine |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is much more detailed.

==Reception==
While Interplay&lt;ref name="launchrelease" /&gt; and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=May |first=Scott A.|date=August 1994|title=Games that are good for you|journal=[[COMPUTE!]]|publisher=Small System Services|location=[[Greensboro, North Carolina]] |volume=16 |issue=8|pages=90 |issn=0194-357X |oclc=5391833|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue167/90_Games_that_are_good_.php|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; had billed the game upon its release as being appropriate for children as young as age 10, it drew criticism for being extremely difficult.&lt;ref name="tamewalk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Aldrin takes a tame walk into space|last=Black|first=Dorian|date=1993-06-01|work=[[The Age]]|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twonew"&gt;{{cite news|title=Two new space programs inform while entertaining Interplay game is history lesson|last=Warner |first=Jack |date=1993-10-24|work=[[The Atlanta Journal and Constitution]]|page=P10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also criticized by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as being "rather lifeless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GAMES REVIEWS|last=Minson|first=John|date=1993-06-10|work=[[The Guardian]]|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' was more positive, wishing for a CD-ROM version but stating that it was a "game that should appeal to anyone with even a casual interest in space exploration".&lt;ref name="james199308"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=109 | title=Interplay's Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space | work=Computer Gaming World | date=August 1993 | accessdate=12 July 2014 | author=James, Jeff | pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game received a 90/100 score from ''[[PC Gamer#PC Gamer UK|PC Gamer UK]]'',&lt;ref name="pcguk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.co.uk/games/gamefile_review_page.asp?item_id=174 |title=Buzz Aldrins Race Into Space |last=Butcher |first=Andy |work=[[PC Gamer#PC Gamer UK|PC Gamer UK]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |accessdate=2008-08-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020523020217/http://www.pcgamer.co.uk/games/gamefile_review_page.asp?item_id=174 |archivedate=2002-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a finalist for the ''[[COMPUTE!]]'' Choice Awards in 1993.&lt;ref name="computechoice"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bixby |first=Robert |date=December 1993 |title=Compute Choice Awards|journal=[[COMPUTE!]]|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue159/8_Compute_Choice_Award.php|publisher=Small System Services |location=[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]|volume=15|issue=12|page=8|issn=0194-357X|oclc=5391833}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, ''[[PC Gamer UK]]'' named ''Race Into Space'' the 26th best computer game of all time. The editors called it "the most successful piece of 'educational' software available for the PC".&lt;ref name=pcgameruktop50&gt;{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[PC Gamer UK]] | title=The ''PC Gamer'' Top 50 PC Games of All Time |date=April 1994 | issue=5 | pages=43–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has remained popular enough with fans to spawn an open-source version from the original developers at Strategic Visions in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raceintospace.org/|title=Race Into Space Project: Overview |publisher=Race Into Space Project |accessdate=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escapist_3"&gt;[[#varney_2005|Varney 2005]], p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; which was downloaded from [[Sourceforge]] between 2005 and 2017 over 90,000 times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sourceforge.net/projects/raceintospace/files/stats/timeline?dates=2000-04-28+to+2017-05-04 2000-04-28+to+2017-05-04 downloads] on [[sourceforge.net]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the improvements mentioned above have made the game less difficult.

==Realism==
[[Image:RIS XMS-2.gif|thumb|right|"XMS-2" [[Reusable launch system|reusable]] minishuttle, a fictional successor to the [[X-20 Dyna-Soar]] (the picture used is actually of the [[Martin Marietta X-24A|X-24A]] [[lifting body]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#bronner_1993|Bronner 1993]], p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While Strategic Visions worked to accurately simulate space launches and the act of running either space program, they made a number of simplifications for balancing as well as for the game to make sense.&lt;ref name="desnotes" /&gt; For example, four NASA launch facilities are condensed into one superfacility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chien|first=Philip|author2=Denny Atkin|date=July 1994|title=Blast off!|journal=[[COMPUTE!]]|publisher=Small System Services|location=[[Greensboro, North Carolina]]|volume=16|issue=7|page=90|issn=0194-357X|oclc=5391833}}&lt;/ref&gt; More significant is the elimination of some minor rocket programs, such as [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone]], and the addition of [[Space rendezvous|docking]] capability to the [[Voskhod spacecraft]].&lt;ref name="desnotes" /&gt; There is also a "basic" model in the game which equalizes costs and safety factors between both sides.&lt;ref&gt;[[#bronner_1993|Bronner 1993]], p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, ''BARIS'' still features most of the major pieces of hardware and approaches to Moon landing that were considered, including [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] (which was the strategy used successfully in [[Project Apollo]]), [[Earth orbit rendezvous]] and [[direct ascent]].&lt;ref name="desnotes" /&gt;

'''Chung Mong-koo''' (born March 19, 1938, in [[Gangwon Province (South Korea)|Gangwon Province]]) is a [[South Korea]]n [[business magnate]] who is the [[chairman]] and CEO of [[Hyundai Motor Group]]. The Hyundai Motor Group consists of 42 [[subsidiaries]] and is the second largest [[Chaebol]] in South Korea. Chung succeeded his father, [[Chung Ju-yung]], the founder of the conglomerate known as the Hyundai Group. When the conglomerate split into several parts in 1999, Chung Mong-koo took over the Hyundai Motor division. He is the eldest surviving son of Chung Ju-yung's eight sons.

He was convicted of [[embezzlement]] and breach of [[fiduciary duty]] in February 2007,&lt;ref name="bloomberg found guilty" /&gt; but was given a [[suspended sentence]] and was fully pardoned by President [[Lee Myung-bak]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

As of March 2014, his net worth was $6.8 billion according to ''Forbes''.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Abram|title=Forbes Billionaires: Full List Of The World's 500 Richest People|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2014/03/03/forbes-billionaires-full-list-of-the-worlds-500-richest-people/13/|work=Forbes|date=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
* Graduated, [[Kyungbock High School]]
* [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[industrial engineering]], [[Hanyang University]]

== Professional experience ==
* 2000–present: Chairman &amp; CEO of [[Hyundai Motor]] Co. &amp; [[Kia Motors]] Corp. 
* 1996–1998: Chairman of [[Hyundai Group]] 
* 1987–1998: CEO, Hyundai Motor Service 
* 1986: CEO, [[Hyundai Steel|Incheon Iron &amp; Steel]]
* 1981: CEO, Hyundai Pipe
* 1977: CEO, [[Hyundai Mobis|Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry]]

He also owns INNOCEAN Worldwide, an ad &amp; [[marketing]] agency, with his eldest daughter Chung Sung-yi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author1=David Kiley |title= Innocean Strives to Be Known as More Than Hyundai Agency |url = http://adage.com/article/agency-news/innocean-strives-hyundai-agency/227144 |work= AdAge |date= April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
Chung is described as a "vigorous septuagenarian" who comes to work at 6:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and "personally heads monthly quality reviews with senior executives".&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;{{cite news|author1=John Lippert|author2=Alan Ohnsman| author3=Rose Kim |title= Billionaire Chung Proving Hyundai No Joke Aiming for BMW|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-03-01/billionaire-chung-proving-hyundai-luxury-no-joke-in-drive-to-top-bmw-cars |work=Bloomberg Business|date=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he only holds 5.2% of Hyundai Motor’s stock, Chung "wields disproportionately strong control" and is able to control its board thanks to a complex [[corporate governance]] arrangements in which Hyundai Motor owns 34% of Kia, which owns 16.9% of [[Hyundai Mobis|Mobis]], which in turn owns 20.8% of Hyundai Motor. This means that "because the companies essentially control each other, no outside shareholder is strong enough to name board members".&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

==Controversies==

=== 2007 embezzlement conviction ===
In 2006, he and his family were targeted by the [[Seoul]] [[Supreme Prosecutors' Office of the Republic of Korea|Supreme Prosecutor's Office]] as part of an investigation into embezzling 100 billion won ($106 million) from Hyundai to create [[slush fund]]s to [[Corruption in South Korea|bribe officials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Kim Jong-moon, Chun Su-jin | title= Hyundai case widens with official's arrest | date=28 March 2006 | work =JoongAng Daily | url = http://joongangdaily.joins.com/200603/27/200603272208478279900090409041.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite a travel ban, Chung left South Korea in April 2006. Chung was arrested on 28 April 2006 on charges related to embezzlement and other corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Kelly | last=Olson | title= Hyundai Chairman Chung Mong-Koo Arrested  | date=28 April 2006 | work =Associated Press | url= http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/04/28/hyundai.probe.ap/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/28/world/asia/28cnd-hyundai.html |title = South Korea Arrests Head of Hyundai Motor | work = New York Times |date=28 April 2006 |author=Sang-Hun, Choe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 February 2007 he was convicted of embezzlement and breach of fiduciary duty for selling securities to his son [[Chung Eui-sun]] at below-market prices. He was sentenced to three years in prison.&lt;ref name="bloomberg found guilty"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=aELMtVK7UHLA |title= Hyundai Motor's Chung Found Guilty of Embezzlement |work =Bloomberg |date=5 February 2007 |author=Seonjin Cha }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chung remained free on bail while he appealed the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=businessNews&amp;storyid=2007-02-05T134525Z_01_SEO243826_RTRUKOC_0_US-HYUNDAI-CHAIRMAN.xml |title=Hyundai Motor chairman sentenced to 3 yrs in jail |work=Reuters |date=5 February 2007 |author=Cheon Jong-woo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310064610/http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=businessNews |archivedate=10 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On September 6, 2007, Chief Judge Lee Jae-hong ruled to suspend the sentence of Chung Mong-koo (in consideration of the huge economic impact of imprisonment), ordering instead of a 3-year jail term, 
community service and a $1 billion{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;!-- The BBC article doesn't say the amount. --&gt; donation to charity.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6981064.stm | title=Guilty Hyundai boss escapes jail | work= BBC News | date=6 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial was seen as "a victory for [[Corruption in South Korea|transparency]] and [[rule of law]] in South Korea",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ishaan Tharoor|title=Top 10 CEO Scandals: Chung Mong Koo, Hyundai Motor|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2009445_2009447_2009523,00.html|work=Time magazine|date=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on August 15, 2008, South Korean President [[Lee Myung-bak]] granted him a special pardon to allow Chung to continue to contribute to the development of Hyundai Motor Group as well as the [[Economy of South Korea|Korean economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Jin Hyun-joo |url = http://www.koreaherald.com/business/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20091230000051 |title= Amnesty clears the way for Lee's comeback to Samsung top job |work= Korea Herald | date= March 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nepotism===
His only son Chung Eui-sun is his "heir apparent", despite his relatively unproven business and leadership skills. According to Bloomberg, "no one can assess how Eui Sun will perform when he becomes chairman because his father keeps him on a tight leash".&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

Furthermore, in 2011, he was accused of [[nepotism]]&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; when Ozen, a bakery cafe whose advisors included his three daughters Sung-yi, Myung-yi, and Yun-yi, set up shop in company buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conglomerate offspring compete in rising bakery cafe sector|url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2011110280108|work=[[The Dong-a Ilbo]]|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozen eventually closed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Kim Su-heon|title=Big bakeries roll on despite absence of chaebol daughters|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_business/555634.html|work=[[Hankyoreh]]|date=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4626">In relation to [[juristic person]]s, the '''constitutional documents''' (sometimes referred to as the '''charter documents''') of the entity are the documents which define the existence of the entity and regulate the structure and control of the entity and its members. The precise form of the constitutional documents depends upon the type of entity.

== Companies ==
By convention, most [[common law]] jurisdictions divide the constitutional documents of [[company (law)|companies]] into two separate documents:&lt;ref&gt;Although, for example, in Australia, a company has a single consolidated corporate constitution.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the '''[[Memorandum of Association]]''' (in some countries referred to as the '''[[Articles of Incorporation]]''') is the primary document, and will generally regulate the company's activities with the outside world, such as the company's objects and powers.
*the '''[[Articles of Association (law)|Articles of Association]]''' (in some countries referred to as the '''[[bylaw|by-laws]]''') is the secondary document, and will generally regulate the company's internal affairs and management, such as procedures for [[Board of directors|board meetings]], [[dividend]] entitlements etc.&lt;ref&gt;In the event of any inconsistency, the Memorandum usually prevails, see ''Ashbury v Watson'' (1885) 30 Ch D 376&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, only the primary document is filed, and the secondary document remains private. In other countries, both documents are filed.

In [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, the company's constitution is normally consolidated into a single document, often called the '''[[charter]]'''.

It is quite common for members of a company to supplement the corporate constitution with additional arrangements, such as ''[[shareholders' agreement]]s'', whereby they agree to exercise their membership rights in a certain way. Conceptually a shareholders' agreement fulfills many of the same functions as the corporate constitution, but because it is a contract, it will not normally bind new members of the company unless they accede to it somehow.&lt;ref&gt;''Shalfoon v Cheddar Valley'' [1924] NZLR 561&lt;/ref&gt; One benefit of shareholders' agreement is that they will usually be confidential, as most jurisdictions do not require shareholders' agreements to be publicly filed.

Another common method of supplementing the corporate constitution is by means of ''[[voting trust]]s'', although these are relatively uncommon outside of the [[United States]] and certain [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore jurisdictions]].

== Partnerships ==
Partnerships also have constitutional documents in the form of a [[partnership agreement]]. In some jurisdictions, a more formal constitution, sometimes referred to as '''articles of partnership''' or a partnership deed is used (particularly where the partnership has certain corporate aspects, such as a [[Limited Liability Partnership]]). However, many partnerships are not created formally, and may have no written partnership agreement and leave the regulation of the partnership to be regulated in accordance with the understandings of the parties and by general law. Some of the largest partnerships in the world have no written partnership agreement.&lt;ref&gt;The best example is probably the leading English [[Magic Circle (law)|magic circle]] law firm, [[Slaughter and May]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trusts ==
A [[trust law|trust]] is not a separate legal entity as such, but is often treated as one for certain legal purposes. Like partnerships, trusts are not normally required to have a written [[trust instrument]] to constitute them,&lt;ref&gt;Although some jurisdictions require one in specific instances, for example, where the trust property include land.&lt;/ref&gt; although most large and formal trusts do.

== Unincorporated associations ==
An [[unincorporated association]] may also have a constitution which provides for the rights and remedies of the members as between themselves, and governs the conduct of the association. Because, in most legal systems, unincorporated associations do not have separate legal personality, this aspect of the constitutional documents is not applicable. In most legal systems unincorporated associations are not required to have formal written constitutions, but many of the larger and more complex organisations would be almost impossible to administer without one.&lt;ref&gt;For example, many [[trade union]]s and [[political party|political parties]] have many millions of members, and would be almost impossible to run without clear internal regulations.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crystal Decisions''' (previously known as ''[[Seagate Software]] Information Management Group'') was a company that was known for its [[business intelligence]] products.

The company was formed when [[hard disk drive]] manufacturer [[Seagate Technology]] acquired [[Holos#Company|Holistic Systems]] and [[Crystal Services]] with the intention of pursuing better profit margins in the [[software]] market. Holistic Systems had a wide range of sales offices, infrastructure and the [[Holos]] [[OLAP]] product, whilst Crystal Services had good [[OEM]] deals for the [[Crystal Reports]] database reporting product that they had written. The first new product from the combined company was Seagate Info, which later evolved to become known as [[Crystal Enterprise]]. [[Crystal Analysis]] followed as an OLAP client.

The company's structure reflected its heritage, with OLAP technologies being developed out of the former Holistic Systems R&amp;D site in [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]] and Relational Database technologies being developed out of the former Crystal Services R&amp;D centre in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].

Crystal Decisions was acquired by [[Business Objects (company)|Business Objects]] in December 2003. As part of this acquisition, the former research and development site in [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]], was closed with a loss of about 80 jobs in order to centralize development in [[Vancouver]] and [[Paris]], with the support for the [[Holos]] product being outsourced to [[Raspberry Software]] based near Ipswich.

The Holos product line has now{{When|date=October 2016}} ceased.

Business Objects was purchased by [[SAP AG|SAP]] in March 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4668">'''Daniel Starch''' (1883–1979) was an American [[psychologist]] and [[marketing research]]er. He is considered to be one of the pioneers of marketing and consumer research in the early 20th century.

==Life==
Starch received a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in mathematics and psychology from the Morning Side College in [[Iowa]]. After that he moved for postgraduation studies to the [[University of Iowa]], where he completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in psychology in 1906. The advisor of his thesis was Charles E. Seashore. After that he worked briefly as a lecturer in Iowa and then went on to teach at [[Wellesley College]] in [[Massachusetts]] while pursuing further studies at [[Harvard University]]. In 1908 he became a professor at the [[University of Wisconsin]] where he stayed until 1919. From 1920 to 1926 he was a professor at Harvard University and in 1923 he founded the marketing research company Daniel Starch and Staff. Later he resigned from his position at Harvard to concentrate on his company and work in the private sector. In 1932 he worked as a consultant and director of a research department of the American Association of Advertising Agencies as well. Starch ran his own company for 50 years until his retirement in 1973 at the age of 90.&lt;ref name="wisconsin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iowa"/&gt;

==Work==
Starch authored several books in the fields of psychology, advertising and marketing research. Best known are ''Experiments in Educational Psychology'' (1911) and his pioneering work about advertising ''Advertising: Its Principles, Practice, and Technique'' and its follow-up ''Principles of Advertising'' (1923). He researched and devised methods to assess the effectiveness of advertising, among them what was later to become known as the "Starch test" or "Starch recognition procedure".  Also named after him is the "Starch formula", which describes how to determine the number of people recalling a full-page advertisement from the number of people recalling a half-page advertisement.&lt;ref name="wisconsin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcgraw-hill"/&gt;

==Early life and work==
Ulrich was born in the small town of [[Ely, Nevada]], but grew up in [[Oregon]]. His father worked as a forester building campgrounds, then transferred in order to direct social programs for [[Job Corps]]. His mother spent time in church and community service.  From his parents, he learned the importance of service and the value of hard work.  The Ulrich family lived subsequently in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where he attended high school.

Ulrich attended [[Brigham Young University]] where he completed his undergraduate degree in University Studies in five semesters and began graduate school in [[Organizational Behavior]].  He was awarded Honorary Doctorate from [[Abertay University]], Dundee Scotland.

==Research and career==
Dave Ulrich’s professional focus has addressed questions on how organizations add value to customers and investors through both leadership and strategic human resource practices. In the human resource area, he and his colleagues have worked to redefine and upgrade HR. With his colleagues, Ulrich has articulated how the modern HR organization can be organized into shared services, centers of expertise, and business partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Ulrich |first= Dave |author-link=  |title= HR Value Proposition |publisher= Harvard Business School Press |pages=  |year= 2005 |url= http://marketplace.rbl.net/collections/publications/products/the-hr-value-proposition |access-date= 2009-02-10 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090217045028/http://marketplace.rbl.net/collections/publications/products/the-hr-value-proposition |archive-date= 2009-02-17 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also co-directed research on over 90,000 respondents about the competencies required for successful HR professionals;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Ulrich |first= Dave |author-link=  |title= HR Competencies |publisher= The Society for Human Resource Management |pages=  |year= 2008 |url= http://marketplace.rbl.net/collections/publications/products/hr-competencies |access-date= 2009-02-10 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090217050343/http://marketplace.rbl.net/collections/publications/products/hr-competencies |archive-date= 2009-02-17 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, he has helped shape thinking on how to transform HR practices so that they are aligned to customer needs and integrated around organization capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Ulrich |first= Dave |author-link= |title= HR Transformation |publisher= The RBL Group |pages= |year= 2009 |url= }}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the leadership area, Norm Smallwood and Ulrich have worked to focus on the outcomes of effective leadership;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Ulrich |first= Dave |author-link=  |title= Results-Based Leadership |publisher= Harvard Business School Press |pages=  |year= 1999 |url= http://marketplace.rbl.net/collections/publications/products/results-based-leadership |access-date= 2009-02-10 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090217050044/http://marketplace.rbl.net/collections/publications/products/results-based-leadership |archive-date= 2009-02-17 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have also shown how leadership will increase customer share by creating a leadership brand within the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Ulrich |first= Dave |author-link=  |title= Leadership Brand |publisher= Harvard Business School Press |pages=  |year= 2007 |url= http://marketplace.rbl.net/collections/publications/products/leadership-brand |access-date= 2009-02-10 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090217050439/http://marketplace.rbl.net/collections/publications/products/leadership-brand |archive-date= 2009-02-17 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work also illustrates that investing in leadership will increase shareholder value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Ulrich |first= Dave |author-link=  |title= How Leaders Build Value |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=  |year= 2003 |url= http://marketplace.rbl.net/collections/publications/products/how-leaders-build-value |access-date= 2009-02-10 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090218235610/http://marketplace.rbl.net/collections/publications/products/how-leaders-build-value |archive-date= 2009-02-18 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work also synthesizes the thicket of leadership competency models into a unified view of leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Ulrich |first= Dave |author-link=  |title= Leadership Code |publisher= Harvard Business Press |pages=  |year= 2008 |url= http://marketplace.rbl.net/collections/publications/products/the-leadership-code |access-date= 2009-02-10 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090217045034/http://marketplace.rbl.net/collections/publications/products/the-leadership-code |archive-date= 2009-02-17 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their current work attempts to look at leadership through the eyes and expectations of investors.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13038">'''Deinking''' is the [[industrial process]] of removing [[printing ink]] from [[Fiber crop|paperfibers]] of [[recycled paper]] to make [[deinked pulp]].

The key in the deinking process is the ability to detach ink from the fibers. This is achieved by a combination of mechanical action and chemical means. In Europe the most common process is [[froth flotation]] deinking.

Paper is one of the main targets for [[Paper recycling|recycling]]. A concern about recycling [[wood pulp]] paper is that the fibers are degraded with each cycle and after being recycled 4–6 times the fibers become too short and weak to be useful in making paper.&lt;ref name="paperinfosheet"&gt;{{cite web |title=Paper Recycling Information Sheet|url=http://www.wasteonline.org.uk/resources/InformationSheets/paper.htm |publisher=Waste Online |accessdate= October 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|history of paper}}
Before the invention of the [[paper machine]] in 1799 the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, hence the name [[rag paper]]. The rags were from [[hemp]], [[linen]] and [[cotton]]. It was not until the introduction of [[wood pulp]] in 1843 that paper production was independent of recycled materials.&lt;ref name=PST1&gt;{{cite book |last1=Göttsching|first1=Lothar|authorlink1= |last2=Pakarinen |first2=Heikki |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Recycled Fiber and Deinking|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 7 |year= 2000|origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-07-1 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 12–14 |chapter= 1|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paper recycling|Recycling of used paper]] before the [[industrialisation]] of paper production, rag paper was recycled to make low-grade [[Paperboard|board]]. A process for removing printing inks from recycled paper was invented by [[German people|German]] jurist [[Justus Claproth]] in 1774.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt; He practiced together with German paper producer [[Johann Engelhard Schmid]]. Today this method is called deinking.

First in the 1950s and 1960s the use of recycled fibres from paper made of wood pulp begun to increase, and was mainly used in packaging paper and paperboard. In the 1950s the [[froth flotation]] technique was adapted for deinking [[recycled paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Pulp |editor1-last=Sixta |editor1-first=Herbert |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Germany |isbn=3-527-30999-3 |volume=2 |page=1174 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of recovered paper increased in the 1970s mainly in graphic and hygienic papers, and accelerated in the 1980s. The annual growth in use of recovered paper increased by 6% between 1980 and 1996. The use of virgin fibres only increased 2% in the same period. In 1997 recovered paper production was 42% of the total paper production.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt;

===Sorting===
Waste paper may contain a mixture of different [[Paper#Applications|paper types]] made of mixtures of different paperfibers. These must be sorted before processed. Broke (paper waste from paper production) is normally used directly in the [[papermachine]].

* Old [[magazine paper]]s (OMP)
* Old [[newspaper|newsprint]] (ONP)

Recycled paper can be used to make paper of the same or lower quality than it was originally. The sorted paper is baled and shipped to a [[papermill]]. The pulpmill uses waste paper grade according to the paper quality they want to make.

===Debaling===
The bales are opened and large foreign objects are sorted out on the [[conveyor belt]] to the [[pulper]]. Many extraneous materials are readily removed. Twine, strapping, etc. are removed from the hydropulper by a "ragger". Metal straps and staples can be screened out or removed by a magnet. Film-backed pressure-sensitive tape stays intact: the PSA adhesive and the backing are both removed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pstc.org/technical_notes/to_recycle.php?subject=packaging |title=Packaging Tapes: To Recycle of Not |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Jensen |first=Timothy |date=April 1999 |publisher=Adhesives and Sealants Council |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109204909/http://www.pstc.org/technical_notes/to_recycle.php?subject=packaging |archivedate=2007-11-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pulping===
Pulpers are either batch, which uses a tub with a high shear rotor, or continuous, using a long, perforated drum.  Drum pulpers are very expensive but have the advantage of not breaking up contaminants, thus giving cleaner end product.

The pulper chops the paper to smaller pieces; water and chemicals are added. Normally the [[pH]] is adjusted to 8.5 - 10.0. Normal deinking chemicals are: 
* pH control: [[sodium silicate]] or [[sodium hydroxide]]
* Bleaching: [[hydrogen peroxide]]
* [[Calcium]] [[ion]] source: [[hard water]], [[lime (material)|lime]] or [[calcium chloride]]
* Collector: [[fatty acid]], fatty acid [[emulsion]], fatty acid [[soap]] or organo-modified [[siloxane]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent

After pulping, the mixture is a [[slurry]]. The slurry goes to [[Kraft process#Screening|screening]].

===Cleaning and screening===
[[Centrifugal cleaning]] is spinning the pulp slurry in a cleaner, causing materials that are denser than pulp fibers to move outward and be rejected. [[Sieve|Screens]], with either slots or holes, are used to remove contaminants that are larger than pulp fibers.

Materials which are more difficult to remove include wax coatings on corrugated cartons and '''[[stickies (papermaking)|stickies]]''', soft rubbery particles which can make deposits and contaminate the recycled paper. Stickies can originate from [[book binding]]s, [[hot melt adhesive]]s, PSA [[adhesive]]s from paper labels, [[laminating]] adhesives of reinforced gummed [[Adhesive tape|tapes]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tlmi.com/recycling-standards.php |title=Recycling Compatible Adhesives Standards |accessdate=2007-11-06 |year=2007 |publisher=Tag and Label Manufacturers Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109230413/http://www.tlmi.com/recycling-standards.php |archivedate=2007-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corrugated.org/Upload/Files/WaxAlternativesStandard.pdf |title=Voluntary Standard for Repulping and Recycling Corugated Fiberboard |accessdate=2007-11-06 |year=2005 |publisher=Corrugated Packaging Alliance |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203163418/http://www.corrugated.org/Upload/Files/WaxAlternativesStandard.pdf |archivedate=2007-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf1998/seite98a.pdf |title=Environmentally benign USPS stamps  | accessdate = 2007-11-08 |last=Seiter, Pikulin, |first= |date=October 1998 |publisher=TAPPI Pulping Conference|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deinking stage===
In the deinking stage the goal is to release and remove the [[hydrophobic]] contaminants from the recycled paper. The contaminants are mostly [[printing ink]] and [[stickies (papermaking)|stickies]]. Several processes are used, most commonly flotation or washing.

====Flotation deinking====
[[Image:FlCell.PNG|thumb|240px|right|Diagram of a [[froth flotation]] cell.]]
[[Froth flotation]] was adapted from the flotation process used in the [[mining industry]] in the 1960s. It is the most common deinking process in [[Europe]] used to recover [[recycled paper]]. Often most of the collector is added to the inlet of the flotation. The process temperatures are normally in the range 45 - 55 °C. [[Air]] is blown into the pulp [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]. The collector has [[Chemical affinity|affinity]] both to the ink particles and air bubbles, causing them to attach. The air bubbles lift the ink to the surface and form a thick [[froth]] that can be removed. Normally the setup is a two stage system with 3, 4 or 5 flotation cells in series.&lt;ref&gt;Voith EcoCell flotation plant {{cite web |url=http://www.voithpaper.com/applications/productsearch/files/594_VPR-PB-07-0001-GB-07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824075218/http://www.voithpaper.com/applications/productsearch/files/594_VPR-PB-07-0001-GB-07.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flotation deinking is very effective in removing ink particles larger than about 10&amp;nbsp;µm.

====Wash deinking====
Wash deinking consists of a washing stage where [[dispersant]]s are added to wash out the [[printing ink]]s. When the pulp slurry is [[dewatering|dewatered]] (thickened), the medium to fine particles are [[Washing|washed]] out. This process is most useful for removing particles smaller than about 30&amp;nbsp;µm, like water-based inks, fillers, coating particles, fines and [[stickies (papermaking)|micro stickies]]. This process is more common when making [[deinked pulp]] for [[Facial tissue|tissue]]. The processing equipment are  [[belt filter]]s, pressure belt filters, [[disk filter]]s and static [[Water filter|filters]]. This stage is much more efficient than normal washing / dewatering stages.

====Combined washing and flotation====
High quality deinking of office wastes and other printing papers often commonly uses a combination of washing and flotation.

====Enzymatic deinking====
This method of deinking uses industrial or food grade enzymes in conjunction with flotation deinking to aid in the removal of inks in recycling mills. More efficient removal of ink increases fiber yield, decreases dirt count, and increases paper brightness. Often the use of enzymatic deinking helps mills reduce their bleach usage or use cheaper furnish.

====Other deinking processes====
[[Dissolved air flotation]] (DAF) is used by some mills in the deinking stage and will remove some ink and filler (ash); however, it is mainly used to clarify the process water.

===Washing / dewatering===
Washing / dewatering (thickening) is a filtration process. Small particles (&lt; 5&amp;nbsp;µm) are removed by passing water through the pulp.

===Bleaching===
{{Main|Bleaching of wood pulp}}

If white paper is desired, [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching]] uses [[peroxide]]s or [[sodium dithionite|hydrosulfites]] to increase the [[brightness]] of the pulp. The bleaching methods are similar for mechanical pulp, but the goal is to make the fiber brighter.

===Papermaking===
The deinked fiber is made into a new paper product in the same way that virgin [[wood fiber]], see [[papermaking]].

===Byproducts===
The unusable material left over, mainly ink, plastics, filler and short fibers, is called '''sludge'''. The sludge is buried in a landfill, burned to create energy at the paper mill or used as a fertilizer by local farmers.

===Problems===
Water based [[flexo]]graphic printing inks with [[particle size]]s below 5&amp;nbsp;µm and poor solubility in [[alkaline]] conditions may cause problems in deinking, especially in the flotation stage. The solution is to use an extra [[acidic]] washing stage.

Temperature control is important as this affects the stickiness of [[stickies (papermaking)|stickies]].

Additional issues arise when taking into account the number of chemicals potentially present in paper for recycling. Studies have indicated that paper might contain as many as 10,000 different chemicals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Waste paper for recycling: Overview and identification of potentially critical substances|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X15001312|journal = Waste Management|doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2015.02.028|first = Kostyantyn|last = Pivnenko|first2 = Eva|last2 = Eriksson|first3 = Thomas F.|last3 = Astrup}}&lt;/ref&gt; fate of which in the deinking process still remains unknown.

'''Domingo Bartolomé Francisco Matheu''' (4 August 1765, in Barcelona, Spain &amp;ndash; 28 March 1831, in Buenos Aires, Argentina) was a Spanish-born Argentine businessman and politician.  He was a member of the [[Primera Junta]], the first national government of modern Argentina, and the second president in the end of the [[Junta Grande]] from August to September 1811.

== Biography ==
Domingo Bartolomé Francisco Matheu was born in August 4, 1765, in [[Mataró]]. His parents were Juan Pablo José Benito Matheu Ros and Antonia Xicola. He studied in the school "Pías" of Mataró, and then focused in math and naval studies. He became a pilot, and visited other Spanish territories as [[La Habana]], [[Philippines]] and the [[Canary Islands]]. He moved to Buenos Aires in 1791, and opposed the trade regulations of the time. He sought both economic and political support among the local society.&lt;ref&gt;National..., pp. 303-304&lt;/ref&gt;

Matheu joined the Regiment of Miñones during the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata]]. He was appointed lieutenant of the second company, under the command of [[Juan Larrea (politician)|Juan Larrea]]. On August 19, 1806, a few days after the liberation of Buenos Aires from British rule, Matheu, Larrea and other neighbours requested authorization to create a new military unit, "Urbanos Voluntarios de Cataluña". Viceroy [[Santiago de Liniers]] approved it on September 26. As Larrea got ill, Matheu led this unit during the second British attack in 1807. He retired from the combats in Miserere, and waged [[urban warfare]] from the buildings of the city. He was awarded by a Real Order in January 1809 for his role in the defense of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;National..., p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peninsular War]] in Spain, along with the capture of the king [[Ferdinand VII]] and the fall of the [[Junta of Seville]], escalated political disputes in Buenos Aires that led to the [[May Revolution]]. Several criollos thought that the viceroy [[Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros]], appointed by the fallen Junta, did not have legitimacy, and requested an [[open cabildo]] to discuss it. Azcuénaga attended it, and voted for the creation of a [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Junta]] with deputies from all the provinces, with the Cabildo ruling in the interregnum. However, the majority agreed with the creation of a junta, but with another junta of people from Buenos ruling during in the meantime. The viceroy tried to stay in government as president of the Junta, which was resisted by the criollos. The reasons of Matheu's inclusion in the Junta are unclear, as with all its members. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between [[carlotism|Carlotists]], [[Martín de Álzaga|Alzaguists]], the military and the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Luna, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scenna, pp. 43-47&lt;/ref&gt;

The May Revolution began the [[Argentine War of Independence]], which was complicated by the lack of weapons in the country. Without enough resources to buy them, the [[Primera Junta]] established armories. The first director, Juan Taragona, was soon replaced by Matheu. Working alongside German gunsmiths as Juan Frye and Fernando Lamping, he directed the creation of several muskets and some pieces of artillery. The armory of Buenos Aires, located at the site of the modern [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Palace of Justice]], had only 90 employees, including seven slaves and seven natives. They had limited technical knowledge, but managed to build and repair nearly three hundred muskets and a hundred of carbines. Matheu gave financial support to the armory with his own wealth. [[Eduard Ladislas Kaunitz, baron von Holmberg|Eduard Holmberg]] was appointed director in 1813, replacing Matheu, but Matheu kept working for the armory anyway. He supervised as well the armory of the [[Tucumán Province]]. He directed later the manufacture of military uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;National..., pp. 305-307&lt;/ref&gt;

After the departure of Cisneros following the [[May Revolution]] he was designated vocal of the [[Primera Junta]]. The Primera Junta became the [[Junta Grande]] afterwards, and Matheu was designated its president when [[Cornelio Saavedra]] left it to join the battles in the north. Matheu and Larrea supported the national government with the money they obtained from commerce.

He retired from political life in 1817, staying just in commercial activities until his death in 1831.

== Legacy ==
Domingo Matheu led the first armory of Argentina. General [[Manuel Nicolás Savio]] organized the construction of an arsenal in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]], named after Matheu. The cornerstone was placed on October 3, 1942, and worked for many decades. The place was used as a detention center during the [[Dirty War]] in the 1970s.

[[File:Eriesky2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Downtown Erie skyline]]
'''Downtown Erie''', is the central business, cultural and government center for the city of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], United States. 
Erie’s Central Business District includes [[Gannon University]], [[UPMC Hamot|UPMC Hamot hospital]], [[Erie Insurance]], and city and county government offices, as well as other non-government related commercial retail and office development.  Nearly 20,000 people work in downtown Erie. As of 2000, 2,690 people lived downtown. 

==Location==
Downtown Erie is a 70 block area. From the foot of State Street to 14th Street (North and South), and from Holland Street to Sassafras Street (East and West).

==Transportation==
*'''Trolley-''' Downtown is served by the EMTA's Bay Liner trolley system, a free trolley service that travels from the foot of State Street to 14th Street. 
*'''Taxi-''' The Erie Cab Co. runs seven days a week. Erie taxis are permitted to pick up passengers in response to a street hail.
*'''Bus-''' The EMTA's buses runs seven days a week in the city.  

==Downtown Districts==
Downtown Erie is divided into 3 different areas, Bayfront district,downtown center city and midtown.

===Bayfront District===
Bayfront district is home to much of downtown’s employers. It is home to Gannon University, UPMC Hamot hospital, and [[Erie Insurance]]. The Bayfront district is also where the [[Bayfront Convention Center]] and Sheraton Hotel are located. The Blasco Library, [[Erie Maritime Museum]], [[Erie Art Museum]], restaurants, bars and marinas are all located in the Bayfront district.

===Center City===
[[Image:Erie, Pennsylvania 1922.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Downtown in the 1920s]]
Center City is where many of the Erie’s high rise buildings are located. The [[Renaissance Centre (Erie, Pennsylvania)|Renaissance Centre]] is Erie’s tallest building. Located in the center city are: The Boston Store, The [[Warner Theatre (Erie, Pennsylvania)|Warner Theatre]], [[Erie Insurance Arena]], [[UPMC Park]], [[Perry Square]], restaurants, bars and night clubs as well as many retail shops. Center city is also home to 14 banks. Also located in the center city is Gannon University, as well [[St. Peter's Cathedral, Erie|St. Peter's Cathedral]]. The cathedral is the city's largest structure, standing 265 feet (81 m) tall.

===Midtown===
Midtown, located from 12th to 14th streets, is where the old US Post Office at Griswold Plaza, [[Union Station (Erie, Pennsylvania)|Union Station]], as well as nightclubs, restaurants, and residential apartments, are located. As of fall 2009, Midtown renovations of the five-story Mercantile Building and Griswold Plaza are complete.  Additionally, a townhouse development is planned. The name "Midtown" is actually only a real estate term to brand the area for redevelopment. Erie's actual and traditional Midtown begins four blocks south of this area, from 18th Street/Former Norfolk Southern tracks to 26th Street.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Downtown redevelopment== 
The Erie Redevelopment Authority made a master plan to redevelop the entire downtown area. As of fall 2009 the first phase was nearly complete.  The first phase was the redevelopment of midtown. Other redevelopments of the downtown include: a $42 million renovation to the Erie Insurance Arena, streetscape improvements to 12th street, facade improvements to many downtown buildings, new building and retail development and new townhouses and residential condos along the bayfront bluffs.

==Early life==
Blake was born in [[Bedford]] in 1879, the son of William Blake who had moved to [[Bedford]] to manage a photographic business, and Annie Blake, a talented photographer.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt; When he left [[Bedford Modern School]] in 1895 'his form master reportedly told him that he was a lazy, talkative, brainless youth who will never be any good'.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt;

==Career==
Blake followed his brother Bill into their father's business and 'the brothers worked together as lanternists for lecturers and lime-light operators for theatrical productions and concert parties'.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt;

Annie Blake encouraged Blake and his brother to take up [[cinematography]] which had been pioneered in London and Paris in the late 1880s.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt; From 1897 the Blake brothers 'developed a travelling picture show using first their own [[animatograph]] and then a gas-illuminated projector which they used to transport around Bedfordshire villages using a pony and trap'.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt; He was showing motion pictures to audiences as early as 1897.&lt;ref name="mocavo.co.uk"/&gt;

[[Eastman Kodak]], the US film and camera company, started to set up a network of shops throughout the UK where Blake and his father were already stockists.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt; In 1903, Blake joined [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak Ltd.]] as a demonstrator and salesman.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt;

In 1911, Blake became general manager of the [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] cinematographic film department.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt; When called to service during [[World War I]], Blake was mainly commissioned in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] to work on aerial photographic duties.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt;

After [[World War I|the war]], Blake became European and Overseas manager for [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]].  By that time, motion picture film had become a major source of revenue for [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] and Blake visited film studios around the world.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt; In 1946, Blake was made Chairman of [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak UK]] overseeing a major expansion of the company in the UK and Europe; he became semi-retired at age 75 but remained a consultant and did not finally resign his directorship until he was 80.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mcnygenealogy.com/book/kodak/kodakery-v05-n12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blake brothers were founder members of the Cinema Veterans’ Association in 1924 and both were later presidents.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcinemaandtelevisionveterans.org.uk/about-us/our-history/|title=British Cinema and Television Veterans, BCTV – Our History|work=British Cinema and Television Veterans, BCTV|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blake played a prominent part in the Kinematograph Manufacturers' Association and the [[British Kinematograph, Sound and Television Society|British Kinematograph Society]] and the [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]].&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/transactionsofso37soci#page/114/mode/2up/search/EE+Blake|title=Transactions of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers (1929)|work=''archive.org''|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/transactionsofso37soci#page/n261/mode/2up/search/EE+Blake|title=Transactions of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers (1929)|work=''archive.org''|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smpte.org/smpte-fellows|title=S|work=''smpte.org''|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later became a member of the Cinema Consultative Committee.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt;

==Family life==
Blake, who had a continuing interest in [[Bedfordshire]] cricket, played water polo in his early years and would be closely associated with rugby throughout his life, being President of [[Bedford Blues|Bedford RUFC]] from 1938 until his death.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gloucesterrugbyheritage.org.uk/documents/531003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Blake died in [[Bedford]] in 1961 and was survived by his wife Louise and only son George Sidney William Blake.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt;

Blake, 'a cheerful and forceful pioneer in photography' and 'one of the most influential men in the world's film industry,' was widely known as 'a colourful personality...a rugged and earthy character given to strong views and prejudices', famous for his after-dinner speeches with stories from the film business; he was said to be able to mix with anybody.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Obituary of Ernest Edgar Blake, British Kinematography, August 1961&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral was attended by [[Herbert Morrison|Lord Morrison of Lambeth]], then chairman of the [[British Board of Film Censors]], and many others from the worlds of photography, cinematography and sport.&lt;ref name="bedfordboroughcouncilandcentralbedfordshirecouncil1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Edward E. Ayer.jpg|thumb|right|none|200px|Edward E. Ayer at eighty-two, from the painting by [[Ralph Clarkson]]]] --&gt;

'''Edward Everett Ayer''' (November 16, 1841 – May 3, 1927)&lt;ref&gt;"E.E. Ayer Left $600,000 Estate and Rare Pieces." ''The Chicago Tribune'', May 25, 1927. Pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American business magnate, best remembered for the endowments of his substantial collections of books and original manuscripts from [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial-era]] history and [[ethnology]], which were donated to the [[Newberry Library]] and [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]]. Ayer had over time built an immense fortune out of supplying timber to the 19th century's fast-growing [[Rail transport in the United States|railroad industry]]. However, it was a chance encounter in his youth with a book that inspired Ayer's lifelong investments of time and money that resulted one of the largest collections of historical and American literature accumulated by the early 20th century. That book was [[William H. Prescott]]'s famous ''History of the Conquest of Mexico'', which Ayer first read in a small library attached to a [[silver mine]] south of [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] Ayer had been guarding as part of his military service. By his own account, he was indelibly marked by what he read and it became the foundation for his insatiable interest in Indian Americana literature.&lt;ref name="Ayer 1950"&gt;Ayer (1950)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Until 1836, the Ayer family had remained in [[Massachusetts]] since arriving from England two hundred years earlier. Like the colonizers who first came to the [[New World]], Edward's father [[Elbridge Gerry Ayer]] was drawn to the adventure and economic possibilities on the frontier, and moved to Southport (modern-day [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]) where Edward was born in 1841. His older sister Mary was possibly "the first white child born" there.&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood (1929, p.3)&lt;/ref&gt; A military road established by Congress turned Southport into an increasingly significant trade route. Ayer's father opened a general store, contracted a blacksmith, and even dabbled in grain brokering. He sold his enterprise to buy land five miles south where a train station was to be built. There he had the fortune to participate in the planning of the town of [[Harvard, Illinois]]. His efforts led to limited railroad construction contracts. Young Edward was educated at the first school built in Harvard, where he recalls "books were very scarce ... I virtually never saw any but the Bible and [[Josephus]]' works."&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from Ayer (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860 at the age of nineteen, Ayer headed west to [[Silver City, Nevada]] where he found employment at a quartz mine. With money saved from this hard labour Ayer was able to move to [[San Francisco]], where he stayed with family friends and got a job at a [[saw mill]], gaining his first experiences in the industry which would later make his fortune.&lt;ref name="Ayer 1950"/&gt;

As [[California in the American Civil War|California entered the American Civil War]] Ayer enlisted in the First California Cavalry Volunteers in August 1861, spending several years in the [[American southwest]] on military service. During this time, Ayer was stationed guarding the Cerro Colorado silver mine near the Mexican border. The mine had been supplied with a small library by its owners (donated by Colonel [[Samuel Colt]], of Colt [[revolver]] fame), and it was here that Ayer came across a volume of Prescott's ''History of the Conquest of Mexico''. At roughly twenty years old, this was the first library Ayer had ever seen, and upon reading ''Conquest of Mexico'' he describes the experience as one that "seemed to open up an absolutely new world to me".&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood (1929, pp.47–48)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayer returned to Harvard, Illinois at the conclusion of his service in 1864, where he received a third share in his father's general store. Within a month, Ayer was in Chicago on business where he happened past a bookseller and negotiated to purchase Prescott's full five-volume set on the conquests of Mexico and Peru. He recalls that day in his memoir:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I feel that that day, taking those books home, was, perhaps, the happiest day of my life up to that time; and going home I only touched the earth in high places. And I want to reiterate that the finding of Prescott's ''Conquest of Mexico'' in that mine in Arizona in '62, has been responsible and is to be credited as the principal force that has given me a vast amount of enjoyment in this world, and is absolutely responsible for the "Ayer Collection" in the Newberry Library, Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Quotation in Lockwood (1929, p.49).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ayer's nephew was the noted artist [[Elbridge Ayer Burbank]], most renowned for his many paintings of Native American personages.&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood (1929, p.179).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book and manuscript collections==
Edward Ayer went on to amass an enormous collection of books and manuscripts on American history as it pertained to the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American Indian]] (inclusive of [[Central America]]). Ayer was a charter Trustee of Chicago's [[Newberry Library]] when it incorporated in 1892. In 1897, he determined to donate his roughly 50,000 pieces to the library, but because of the enormity of the undertaking, this took until 1911 to complete. As of 1941, three major [[holograph]]s have been discovered in the collection: [[Bernardino de Sahagún]]'s Latin-Spanish-Nahua dictionary, Father [[Junípero Serra]]'s 1769 diary, and Father [[Francisco Ximénez]]' bicolumnar transcription-translation of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] oral tradition (today known as ''[[Popol Vuh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;).

Ayer was also an early benefactor of the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] (FMNH), instrumental in its foundation and serving as its first president.&lt;ref name="Field Museum 2007"&gt;Field Museum (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The FMNH arose from the collections assembled for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893, as the curator in charge of the collections [[F.W. Putnam]] sought to establish a permanent exhibition of the materials. As one of the museum's incorporators, Ayer set to work establishing an endowment fund, and approached the retail magnate [[Marshall Field]] (after whom the museum was later named) for contributions. Field was initially reluctant, reportedly declaring "I don't know anything about a museum, and I don't care to know anything about a museum".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Alexander (1996, p.55).&lt;/ref&gt; However Ayer was eventually able to persuade Field to relent, supposedly through admonishing Field with "You can sell dry goods until hell freezes over, but in 25 years, you will be absolutely forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Anderson (1921).&lt;/ref&gt; Field contributed one million dollars towards the establishment, and a further eight million was bequeathed to the museum from Field's estate upon his death.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (1996, pp.55–56)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayer himself led in the expansion of the museum's library, in 1894 donating 400 of his own volumes on [[ornithology]] and a further 600 he had bought from the collection of [[Charles Cory]]. Ayer continued to expand to the museum library holdings with further purchases of [[natural history]] collections in [[ichthyology]] and other topics, and donations from his own acquisitions. By 1926 in the year before his death the Ayer Collection at FMNH was one of the most extensive and foremost of its type in the world.&lt;ref name="Field Museum 2007"/&gt;

'''Enrico Braggiotti''' (born 27 January 1923) is a [[Monaco|Monegasque]] banker born in a [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantine]] family in [[Turkey]].

Braggiotti was born in [[Turkey]] from a father named ''Etienne'', Head of the [[Ottoman Bank]], and from an Italian mother, ''Renata Solari''. He is married to ''Magda de Portu'' who was born in [[Paris]]. He is the father of four children: ''Jean-Luc'', ''[[:it:Gerardo Braggiotti|Gérard]]'', ''Sandra'' and ''Silvana''.

Braggiotti left Turkey a few weeks after he was born, and moved with his parents and his sister to the [[Principality of Monaco]], where his grandfather ''Henri'' and his grandmother Appolonie Trullet,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://evadoc.com/doc/34770/genealogie-de-la-famille-trullet Trullet's family genealogy]&lt;/ref&gt; the child of a famous family of sailors from [[Saint-Tropez]] (her grandfather was [[Jean-François-Timothée Trullet|Jean-François-Timotée Trullet]], commander of the ''[[French ship Guerrier (1754)|Guerrier]]'', French battleship involved in the [[Battle of the Nile]]).

Braggiotti studied at the [[:fr:Lycée de Monaco|Lycée de Monaco]], and then was hired by the [[Banca Commerciale Italiana]] (Comit) where he will work until his retirement in 1990.

In 1993 he was indicted in the Enimont affair the largest Italian scandal at the time and he was  found guilty of receiving bribes from Mr Raul Gardini.

== Career ==
His career at the bank is pretty standard: 1950 in [[Casablanca]], 1955 in [[Italy]], and 1960 at the Central Division in Milan. In 1965 he became a member of the Central Division Committee, Vice-Executive in 1984, and President in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://mafinance.wordpress.com/2010/10/28/enrico-braggiotti-interview/ Interview with Enrico Braggiotti on MaFinance]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the eighties, the Italian banking system went through deep structural transformations to become international, a process through which most nationalized banks became privately held, including the famous Mediobanca. The Banca Commerciale Italiana led the way to this national transformation, in which Braggiotti played an important role through his position and responsibilities.

In 1990, Braggiotti left the head of the Banca Commerciale Italiana and returned to his homeland: [[Monaco]]. He becomes the CEO of the [[Compagnie Monégasque de Banque]], succeeding to [[Pierre-Paul Schweitzer]], and got involved in the capital with a group of Monegasques, including [[:fr:Jean-Charles Rey|Jean-Charles Rey]]’s family. As board members, he gathered a round of high-profile French personalities: [[Raymond Barre]], [[:fr:Antoine Bernheim|Antoine Bernheim]], [[Jean François-Poncet|Jean-François Poncet]], [[Raoul Biancheri]], [[Henry Rey]]. Braggiotti became a full-fledged Monegasque in 1992. He was also appointed as administrator for the [[Société des Bains de Mer]] in 1988.

In 2004, the Compagnie Monégasque de Banque’s stockholders decided to sell their Mediobanca shares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alacrastore.com/deal-snapshot/Mediobanca_SpA_acquires_remaining_interest_in_CMB-397266 Mediobanca SpA acquires remaining interest in CMB, alacrastore.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Braggiotti left the CMB.

== The Monaco Méditerranée Foundation ==
Enrico Braggiotti now focuses on the [http://www.monaco-mediterranee-foundation.org/fondation.php Monaco Méditerranée Foundation] (MMF) which organizes under the supervision of the [[Prince Albert II]] periodic conferences with distinguished personalities from France and Italy. The Monaco Méditérranée Foundation became the dynamo of Monaco’s cultural life. Among other things, the Principality of Monaco enrolled the MMF in the management of the [[Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures|Anna Lindh Foundation]], a Foundation where Enrico Braggiotti is an active member since the Principality joined the Union for the Méditerranée.

== Boards ==
During his career, Enrico Braggiotti has been board member of [[Lehman Brothers]] in [[New York City]], of [[BNP Paribas]] (Paris), of Sudameris (Paris), of Mediobanca (Milan), of the [[Ciments Français]] (Paris), of the Société des Bains (Monaco), and President of the Compagnie Monégasque de Banque (Monaco).

'''Gassaway''' is a town in [[Braxton County, West Virginia|Braxton County]], [[West Virginia]], in the United States.  The population was 908 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  Gassaway was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1905 and named for [[Henry Gassaway Davis]], the Democratic Party's nominee for Vice President of the United States in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;''West Virginia Blue Book.'' [http://www.legis.state.wv.us/Educational/publications/pub.cfm Published annually] by the Clerk's Office of the [[West Virginia Senate]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[center of population]] of West Virginia is located approximately {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} north of Gassaway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt |title=Population and Population Centers by State: 2000 |publisher=[[United States Census]] |accessdate=2007-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HZRQVgCU?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt |archivedate=2013-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The town was originally created at the ends of two divisions of the [[Coal and Coke Railway]], one originating in [[Charleston, WV|Charleston]] and the other originating in [[Elkins, WV|Elkins]]. Because of its central location, the area was an ideal place to build shops to facilitate the transition between the relatively flat Charleston division, which could operate with standard equipment, and the more hilly Elkins division of the Coal &amp; Coke which required heavier engines. The town was laid out in 1904, and over the next decade, businesses and infrastructure such as hotels, a bank, stores, schools, a hospital, office buildings and churches appeared to serve the growing population. By 1915, the Coal &amp; Coke Railway Company had completed work on a depot to facilitate passenger service to the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gassaway and Community: 1796-1942|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/communities/gassaway.pdf|work=West Virginia Division of Culture and History|publisher=West Virginia Division of Culture and History|accessdate=2013-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Gassaway Depot]] still stands today and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hotel Tycoon Resort''''' is a [[Business simulation game]] created and developed by German studio [[Claw Design Software]], 
published 2010 by [[eFUSION X]].

== Game Storyline ==
The protagonist is in love with the beautiful daughter of a successful but rigorous hotel magnate.
He won't allow them to be together unless the player proves worthy and can show that he is able to manage the 
big hotel business.

== Gameplay ==

The game takes place on several islands. The player can freely create and place pools, 
restaurants and other buildings, palm trees and a variety of decorations.
He can choose to play the story mode consisting of 8 missions or to play the endless mode.
The story mode starts with a small mission map and easy tasks introducing the controls and game mechanics.
As the missions proceed the tasks become more and more challenging.
 
Hotel guests and their needs are simulated on the maps. Hungry guests start searching for a restaurant for example
and will only be satisfied if they are able to find it soon.
Thus it's important to plan roads carefully and create buildings to satisfy guests' needs in time.
Otherwise guests won't come back.
On their route through the hotel park, guests will drop dirt occasionally. Buildings will decay over the time.
The player can choose to hire employees to take care of time consuming tasks such as picking up garbage or 
maintaining and servicing buildings.
Additionally he can collect coins that appear randomly on the map.

== Content ==
The game consists of 8 missions and an endless game mode.
The player can choose between approximately 30 different buildings and decoration objects, which become available as the 
game proceeds and can be created and placed freely.
There are 3 upgrade-levels per building.

==Reception==
Hotel Tycoon Resort was rated 8.5 out of 10 by Gamemobile &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamemobile.co.uk/hoteltycoonresort.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and 6.0 out of 11 (0-10) by Pocketgamer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Mobile/Hotel+Tycoon+Resort/review.asp?c=20564&lt;/ref&gt;
It is currently the second most popular paid game on BlackBerry AppWorld.&lt;ref&gt;http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/category/1?licenseType=2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hui Chiu-yin''' [[Bronze Bauhinia Star|BBS]] ([[Chinese language|Chinese:]] 許招賢), also known as '''John Hui''', is the [[CEO|director]] and [[general manager]] of [[New World First Ferry]] in [[Hong Kong]] after his retirement from the post of [[Chief Superintendent]] &lt;!-- [[Senior Superintendent]]? --&gt; of Marine Regional in [[Hong Kong Police Force]] in 1996. He had been the [[Hong Kong Chief Commissioner|Chief Commission]] of [[The Scout Association of Hong Kong]] from 1997 to 2003.

==Scout==
Hui was awarded the [[Queen's Scout]] in 1960 when he was in the 7th Hong Kong Group of Hong Kong Scout Association and became a scout leader later. He severed in the Island North District, Island Region, the Headquarters and Asia-Pacific Region of the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]].

He succeeded [[Chau Cham Son|Chau Cham-son]] to be the Chief Commission from January 1, 1997. He successfully met the target to increase the number of Scouts to 83,000 in 2002. There are several major events during his commissionership, namely 19th [[Asia-Pacific Regional Scout Conference]] in 1998, [[The Scout Association of Hong Kong]] Millennium Jamboree from 1999 to 2000, 45th Baden-Powell World Fellowship Event in 2002 and The Scout Association of Hong Kong 90th Anniversary Jamboree in 2003. A new region, New Territories East Region is spin off from New Territories Region in 2000.
His appointment ended on December 31, 2003 and was succeeded by [[Pau Shiu Hung|Pau Shiu-hung]].

He was a member of the Regional Scout Committee of Asia Pacific Region from 2001 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apr.scout.or.jp/committee/regional_scout_committees.htm Regional Scout Committee 2004-2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is now the Vice chairperson of the APR Scout Financial Resource Sub-committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scout.org/en/around_the_world/asia_pacific/our_organisation/committees/apr_sub_committees_2009_2012 APR Sub-Committees 2009-2012 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124064958/http://www.scout.org/en/around_the_world/asia_pacific/our_organisation/committees/apr_sub_committees_2009_2012 |date=2010-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New World First Ferry==
After his retirement from Hong Kong Police Force, he was invited to join New World First Ferry in 1996 as he is familiar with the matters of [[Outlying Islands, Hong Kong|Outlying Island]]. He instituted a multi-million (Hong Kong) dollar reform of the ferry, including the replacement of twelve [[hovercraft]]s to increase the navigation stability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://society.eastday.com/epublish/big5/paper148/20010906/class014800013/hwz481569.htm "What do the Hong Kong police officers do after their retirement?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

He became increasingly media exposure following the widely reported ferry accident which occurred on May 12, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.takungpao.com/news/06/05/15/GW-565763.htm News related to ferry accident]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/periodicals/article/1180656-1.html Hong Kong ferry accident not linked to age]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award==
He received a [[Bronze Bauhinia Star]] from [[Hong Kong Government]] in 2003.

In the context of [[computer programming]], '''instrumentation''' refers to an ability to monitor or measure the level of a product's performance, to diagnose errors, and to write [[Tracing (software)|trace]] information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/rtrthelp/v8r0m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.rational.testrt.doc%2Ftopics%2Fcinstruovw.html Source Code Instrumentation Overview at IBM website]&lt;/ref&gt; Programmers implement instrumentation in the form of code [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] that monitor specific components in a system (for example, instructions may output logging information to appear on the screen). When an application contains instrumentation code, it can be managed by using a management tool. Instrumentation is necessary to review the performance of the application. Instrumentation approaches can be of two types: source instrumentation and binary instrumentation.

== Output ==
In programming, instrumentation means the ability of an application to incorporate:

* Code [[Tracing (software)|tracing]] - receiving informative messages about the execution of an application at run time.
* [[Debugging]] and (structured) [[exception handling]] - tracking down and fixing programming errors in an application under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/commenting-testing-and-instrumenting-cod/229300224|title=Commenting, Testing, and Instrumenting Code|date=January 3, 2011|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Profiling (computer programming)|Profiling]] - a means by which dynamic program behaviors can be measured during a training run with a representative input.  This is useful for properties of a program that  cannot be [[static program analysis|analyzed statically]] with sufficient precision, such as [[alias analysis]].
* Performance counters - components that allow the tracking of the performance of the application.
* [[Computer data logging]] - components that allow the logging and tracking of major events in the execution of the application.

== Limitations ==

Instrumentation is limited by execution coverage.  If the program never reaches a particular point of execution, then instrumentation at that point collects no data.  For instance, if a word processor application is instrumented, but the user never activates the print feature, then the instrumentation can say nothing about the routines which are used exclusively by the printing feature.

Some types of instrumentation may cause a dramatic increase in execution time.  This may limit the application of instrumentation to debugging contexts.

==See also==
* [[Hooking]] - range of techniques used to alter or augment the behavior of an operating system, of applications, or of other software components either by intercepting function calls or messages or events passed between software components
* [[Instruction set simulator]] - simulation of all instructions at machine code level to provide instrumentation
* [[Runtime intelligence]] - technologies, managed services and practices for the collection, integration, analysis, and presentation of application usage levels, patterns, and practices
* [[Software performance analysis]] - techniques to monitor code performance, including instrumentation
* [[Hardware performance counter]]
* [[DTrace]] — A comprehensive dynamic tracing framework for troubleshooting kernel and application problems on production systems in real time, implemented in [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[macOS]], [[FreeBSD]], and many other platforms and products.
* [[Java Management Extensions|''Java Management Extensions'' (JMX)]] –  Java technology for managing and monitoring applications, system objects, devices (such as printers), and service-oriented networks
* [[Application Response Measurement]] - standardized instrumentation [[Application programming interface|API]] for [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]
* [[Dynamic recompilation]] - a feature of some emulators and virtual machines where the system may recompile some part of a program during execution

Jan Hoeufft was born in 1578 in [[Liège]] in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] to a family that originated from [[Roermond]]. His father, a merchant in timber, had moved to [[Aachen]], [[Liège]] and [[Heinsberg]] after converting to the [[Reformed Church]].

===Arms dealer and financier===

[[File:Soubise 12 15 Septembre 1625.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Capture of Île de Ré by [[Charles, Duke of Guise]] on September 16th, 1625]]
&lt;!--[[File:RichelieuRochelle.jpg|thumb|right|200px|left|[[Cardinal Richelieu]] at the [[Siege of La Rochelle]] against the [[Huguenot]]s (detail of a painting by [[Henri Motte]], 1881)]]--&gt;

At the time of the [[Thirty Year's War]], arms dealing was a highly lucrative business in Europe. Hoeufft, described by a contemporary as “‘a man capable of speaking and acting’ as well as ‘[having] money to distribute to people should there be need,’” was well-suited to the job.&lt;ref name="Manitoban" /&gt; Hoeufft delt with [[Axel Oxenstierna]], [[Johan Adler Salvius]], [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Abraham de Wicquefort]] and [[Adriaen Pauw]] on the French support for the Swedish army; the money had to be allocated to the [[Amsterdam Wisselbank]].

In finance, he was [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s banker for remitting subsidies during the Thirty Years War, &lt;ref name="Rowlands-2015" /&gt;{{rp|71}} and banker to the [[William, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Dukes of Saxe-Weimar]].{{r|Dienne|p=43}}

Hoeufft occupied a prominent place in the network of political interests that bound together France’s structure of alliances during the Thirty Years War. "In some sense, his political interests were so tightly interwoven with his financial and mercantile interests that they are difficult to disentangle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomson |first1=Erik |title=Jan Hoeufft and the Thirty Years War: An essay on diplomatic history’s limits |url=http://www.cedar.umu.se/digitalAssets/120/120438_joint-seminar-with-guest-researchers.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170308174621/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.cedar.umu.se%2FdigitalAssets%2F120%2F120438_joint-seminar-with-guest-researchers.pdf |archivedate= 8 March 2017 |accessdate=8 March 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydraulic engineering===
[[File:Le Vanneau-Passerelle.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A footbridge over a canal in the [[Marais Poitevin]]]]

The [[Hoeufft]] family invested over a million [[French livre|livres]] in [[reclamation of land|reclamation]] of lakes and swamps in [[Picardie]], [[Poitou]] and other parts of France,&lt;ref name="soundcloud"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomson|first1=Erik|title=Premodern Conversations|url=https://soundcloud.com/ugps/premodern-conversations-erik|website=Soundcloud|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which for the most part were carried out between 1642 and 1653 by Dutch engineers such as {{ill|Jan van Ens|nl||fr|Jean Van Ens}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=-xdjbvHsNaoC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85 Globalization, Environmental Change, and Social History], geredigeerd door Peter Boomgaard en Marjolein 't Hart&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 1650, Hoeufft was the director of the operation to drain the [[Poitou Marsh]] in western France. From the 1640s, one of his associates was David de la Croix, who seems to have married Hoeufft's niece, Marguerite Hoeufft.  When Hoeufft died, de la Croix was among his beneficiaries and also took over the Poitou marsh operation.&lt;ref name="Schapira-2003" /&gt;

Frédéric Otto Fabrice de Gressenich, Councillor and [[Grand Master of France|Maître d'hotel du Roi]], the son of Jean's sister [[Sir William Curtius#Family_and_legacy|Anne]], inherited the Sacy marshes along with his Hœufft cousins. As the only cousin living in France, he administered the lands on their behalf.{{r|Dienne|p=169}}

===Death and legacy===

Hoeufft died in Paris on 5 September 1651.&lt;ref name="Schapira-2003" /&gt; He had two brothers and five sisters who scattered to Cologne, Dordrecht, London, and Utrecht. 

Hoeufft bequeathed two million livres to the poor of the Reformed Church of [[Charenton-le-Pont|Charenton]].&lt;ref name=Douen&gt;{{cite book

'''John Ericsson''' (born '''Johan''') (July 31, 1803 – March 8, 1889) was a [[Swedish-American]] inventor&lt;ref name="haejohnericsson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/ericsson|title=John Ericsson's life|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, active in England and the United States, and regarded as one of the most influential mechanical engineers ever. Ericsson collaborated on the design of the steam locomotive [[Novelty (locomotive)|''Novelty'']], which competed in the [[Rainhill Trials]] on the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], won by [[George Stephenson]]'s [[Stephenson's Rocket|''Rocket'']]. In America he designed the US  Navy's first screw-propelled steam-frigate {{USS|Princeton|1843|6}}, in partnership with Captain [[Robert Stockton]], who unjustly blamed him for a fatal accident. A new partnership with [[Cornelius H. DeLamater]] of the DeLamater Iron Works in New York resulted in the first armoured ship with a rotating [[Gun turret|turret]], {{USS|Monitor}}, which dramatically saved the US naval blockading squadron from destruction by an ironclad Confederate vessel, {{ship|CSS|Virginia}}, at Hampton Roads in March 1862.

==Early career==
[[File:John Ericsson from Hildebrand Sveriges historia.jpg|upright|thumb|John Ericsson]]
Johan Ericsson was born at [[Långban]] in [[Värmland]], Sweden. He was the brother of [[Nils Ericson]], a distinguished canal and railway builder in Sweden. Their father Olaf Ericsson (1778–1818) had worked as the supervisor for a [[mining|mine]] in Värmland. He had lost money in speculation  and had to move his family to [[Forsvik]] in 1810. There he worked as a director of blastings  during the excavation of the Swedish [[Göta Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=15351|title= Nils Ericson|publisher =Svenskt biografiskt lexikon |accessdate= September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=15340|title= Ericson och Ericsson, släkt och friherrlig ätt från Nordmark|publisher =Svenskt biografiskt lexikon|accessdate= September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burnett, Constance Buel, "Captain John Ericsson: Father of the "Monitor"", Vanguard Press, New York, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

The extraordinary skills of the two Ericsson brothers were discovered by [[Baltzar von Platen (1766–1829)|Baltzar von Platen]], the architect of the Göta Canal. They were dubbed 'cadets of mechanics' of the Swedish Royal Navy, and engaged as trainees at the canal enterprise. At the age of fourteen, John was already working independently as a [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]]. His assistant had to carry a footstool for him to reach the instruments during [[surveying]] work.
At the age of seventeen he joined the [[Swedish army]] in [[Jämtland]], serving in the [[Jämtland Ranger Regiment]], as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]], but was soon promoted to Lieutenant. He was sent to northern Sweden to do surveying, and in his spare time he constructed a [[heat engine]] which used the fumes from the fire instead of steam as a propellant. His skill and interest in mechanics made him resign from the army and move to England in 1826. However his heat engine was not a success, as his prototype was designed to burn [[birch]]wood and would not work well with coal (the main fuel used in England).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=     http://runeberg.org/sbh/a0307.html|title= John Ericsson|publisher =   Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon|accessdate= September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Novelty locomotive.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Novelty (locomotive)|Novelty]]'', Braithwaite and Ericsson's entry for the [[Rainhill Trials]]. Illustration from ''The Mechanics Magazine'', 1829.]]
[[File:DampfwagenWilhelmDerIV.JPG|thumb|German drawing (1833) of the steam locomotive [[William IV of the United Kingdom|''Wilhelm IV]] with scale in feet, built by "Braithwaite und Ericsson".]]
Notwithstanding the disappointment, he invented several other mechanisms instead based on [[steam]], improving the heating process by incorporating [[bellows]] to increase [[oxygen]] supply to the fire bed. In 1829 he and [[John Braithwaite (engineer)|John Braithwaite]] built [[Novelty (locomotive)|''Novelty'']] for the [[Rainhill Trials]] arranged by the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. It was widely praised but suffered recurring boiler problems, and the competition was won by English engineers [[George Stephenson|George]] and [[Robert Stephenson]] with [[Stephenson's Rocket|''Rocket'']].

Two further engines were built by Braithwaite and Ericsson, named ''[[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]'' and ''Queen Adelaide'' after the new king and queen. These were generally larger and more robust than ''Novelty'' and differed in several details (for example it is thought that a different design of blower was used which was an 'Induced Draught' type, sucking the gases from the fire). The pair ran trials on the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] but the railway declined to purchase the new designs.

Their innovative steam fire engine proved an outstanding technical success by helping to quell the memorable [[Argyll Rooms]] fire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-steam-fire-engines.org/John_Ericsson.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328131611/http://www.british-steam-fire-engines.org/John_Ericsson.html |archivedate=March 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}

An engine Braithwaite and Ericsson constructed for [[John Ross (Royal Navy officer)|Sir John Ross]]'s 1829 Arctic expedition failed and was dumped on the shores of [[Prince Regent Inlet]]. At this stage of Ercisson's career the most successful and enduring of his inventions was the [[surface condenser]], which allowed a steamer to recover fresh water for its boilers while at sea.  His 'deep sea lead,' a pressure-activated fathometer was another minor, but enduring success. The commercial failure and development costs of some of the machines devised and built by Ericsson during this period put him into debtors' prison for an interval.  At this time he also married 19-year-old Amelia Byam, a disastrous match that ended in the couple's separation until Amelia's death.

==Education==
His only formal education was a basic officer's education and training during his time in the Swedish Army. On March 27, 1822, John passed a surveyor's examination in Stockholm. As a child he was taught to be a miner and surveyor by his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nfbg/0405.html|title=John Ericsson|publisher=Nordisk familjebok|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propeller design==
[[File:John Ericsson Xylography 1878.jpg| thumb|John Ericsson (1878)]]
He then improved ship design with two screw-[[propeller]]s moving in different directions (as opposed to earlier tests with this technology, which used a single screw). However, the [[Admiralty]] disapproved of the invention, which led to the fortunate contact with the encouraging American captain [[Robert Stockton]] who had Ericsson design a propeller steamer for him and invited him to bring his invention to the United States of America, as it would supposedly be more welcomed in that place. As a result, Ericsson moved to New York in 1839. Stockton's plan was for Ericsson to oversee the development of a new class of [[frigate]] with Stockton using his considerable political connections to grease the wheels. Finally, after the succession to the Presidency by [[John Tyler]], funds were allocated for a new design. Unfortunately they only received funding for a 700-ton [[sloop]] instead of a frigate. The sloop eventually became {{USS|Princeton|1843|6}}, named after Stockton's hometown.

The ship took about three years to complete and was perhaps the most advanced warship of its time. In addition to twin screw propellers, it was originally designed to mount a 12-inch muzzle-loading gun on a revolving pedestal. The gun had also been designed by Ericsson and used [[hoop gun|hoop construction]] to pre-tension the [[breech-loading weapon|breech]], adding to its strength and allowing safe use of a larger charge. Other innovations on the ship design included a collapsible funnel and an improved recoil system.

The relations between Ericsson and Stockton had grown tense over time and, approaching the completion of the ship, Stockton began working to force Ericsson out of the project. Stockton carefully avoided letting outsiders know that Ericsson was the primary inventor.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Stockton attempted to claim as much credit for himself as possible, even designing a second {{convert|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} gun to be mounted in ''Princeton''. Unfortunately, not understanding the design of the first gun (originally named "The Orator", renamed "The Oregon" by Stockton), the second gun was fatally flawed.

When launched, ''Princeton'' was an enormous success. On October 20, 1843, she won a speed trial against the paddle steamer {{SS|Great Western}}, until then considered the fastest steamer afloat. Unfortunately, during a firing demonstration of Stockton's gun, the [[USS Princeton disaster of 1844|breech ruptured]], killing Secretary of State [[Abel P. Upshur]] and [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Thomas Walker Gilmer]], as well as six others. Stockton attempted to deflect the blame onto Ericsson,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} with moderate success, despite the fact Ericsson's gun was sound and it was Stockton's gun that had failed. Stockton also refused to pay Ericsson, and by using his political connections, Stockton blocked the Navy from paying him. These actions led to Ericsson's later deep resentment toward the U.S. Navy.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Friendship with Cornelius H. DeLamater==
When Ericsson arrived from England and settled in New York, he was persuaded by Samuel Risley of Greenwich Village to give his work to the Phoenix Foundry.  There he met [[Cornelius H. DeLamater]] and soon a mutual attachment developed between the two, and rarely thereafter did Ericsson or DeLamater enter upon a business venture without first consulting the other."&lt;ref name="Leg Docs"&gt;{{cite book | title = Legislative Document by New York State Legislature, vol 37, no. 117-118 | publisher = J.B.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hot air engine==
Ericsson then proceeded to invent independently the caloric, or [[hot air engine|hot air, engine]] in the 1820s which used hot air, [[Caloric theory|caloric]] in the scientific parlance of the day, instead of steam as a propellant. A similar device had been patented in 1816 by the Reverend [[Robert Stirling]]&lt;ref name="haestirling1816"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/stirling/the-stirling-engine-of-1816/the-air-engine|title=The Stirling 1816 hot air engine|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, whose technical priority of invention provides the usual term 'Stirling Engine' for the device.  Ericsson's engine was not initially successful due to the differences in combustion temperatures between Swedish wood and British coal. In spite of his setbacks, Ericsson was awarded the [[Rumford Prize]] of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1862 for his invention.  

In 1830 Ericsson patents his second engine&lt;ref name="haeericsson1830"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/ericsson/the-1830-engine|title=Ericsson's 2nd engine|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, that can work either with steam, air or water. This rotative engine objective is to reduce the engine within more convenient limits without any corresponding loss of power.

In 1833 Ericsson build his third engine&lt;ref name="haeericsson1833"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/ericsson/the-engine-of-1833|title=Ericsson's 3rd engine|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a hot air engine (or caloric engine) that is exhibited in London : "the engine will prove the most important mechanical invention ever conceived by the human mind, and one that will confer greater benefits on civilized life than any that has ever preceded it" (John O. Sargent). This engine includes a [[Regenerative heat exchanger|regenerator]] that will inspire many other hot air engine inventors.

The caloric ship, the 4th Ericsson engine, will be built in 1852&lt;ref name="haeericsson1852-ship"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/ericsson/ericsson-caloric-engine-of-1851|title=Ericsson's caloric ship|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
A group of New York merchants and financiers headed by John B Kitching, Edward Dunham, President of the Corn Exchange Bank, and G.B. Lamar, president of the Bank of the Republic, backed the project and in April, 1852, the keel of the ship was laid at the yard of Perine, Patterson, and Stack in Williamsburgh. At about the same time the construction of the engine was commenced by Messrs Hogg and Delamater. 
Hull and machinery were built in the greatest possible secrecy, both Ericsson and his financial backers being convinced that their ship would revolutionize ocean transport by its economy and safety, and that competitors would if possible copy the design of at least the engine. 
On September 15, 1852, the ship was launched and in November the engine was turned over at the dock under its own power. It will be a failure.
Smaller experimental engines based on the same patent design and built before the caloric ship will prove to be working efficiently.

In his later years, the caloric engine would render Ericsson comfortably wealthy, as its boilerless design made it a much safer and more practical means of power for small industry than steam engines.  Ericsson's incorporation of a 'regenerator' heat sink for his engine made it tremendously fuel-efficient. Apparently in the post Civil War era some time before or around 1882, from the publishing date, a ship was purchased by a Captain Charles L. Dingley called the ''Ericsson'' with a weight of 1,645 tons that was built by John Ericsson (Although the above section on John Ericsson's Friendship with Cornelius H. DeLamater says that the ship known as the ''Ericsson'' was built by the DeLamater Iron Works) to try out the hot air engine as a motive power in open ocean navigation.&lt;ref name="Hittell"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hittell | first = John Shertzer | title = The Commerce and Industries of the Pacific Coast of North America, Comprising the Rise, Progress, Products, Present Condition, and Prospects of the Useful Arts on the Western Side of Our Continent, and Some Account of Its Resources, with Elaborate Treatment of Manufactures; Briefer Consideration of Commerce, Transportation, Agriculture, and Mining; and Mention of Leading Establishments and Prominent Men in Various Departments of Business | publisher = San Francisco A.L.

In 1883 John Ericsson built a solar air engine&lt;ref name="haeericssonsolar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotairengines.org/stirling-engines-inventors/ericsson/solar-hot-air-engine/the-sun-motor|title=Ericsson's Solar Air Engine|work=hotairengines.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1 HP. The leading feature of the sun motor is that of concentrating the radiant heat by means of a rectangular trough having a curved bottom lined on the inside with polished plates, so arranged that they reflect the sun’s rays toward a cylindrical heater placed longitudinally above the trough. 
This heater, it is scarcely necessary to state, contains the acting medium, steam or air, employed to transfer the solar energy to the motor; the transfer being effected by means of cylinders provided' with pistons and valves resembling those of motive engines of the ordinary type. Practical engineers, as well as scientists, have demonstrated that solar energy cannot be rendered available for producing motive power, in consequence of the feebleness of solar radiation.

==Ship design==
On September 26, 1854, Ericsson presented [[Napoleon III of France]] with drawings of iron-clad armored [[battle ship]]s with a [[dome]]-shaped gun tower, and even though the French emperor praised this particular plan of an invention, he did nothing to bring it to practical application. In 1851 he designed the [[Ericsson cycle#Caloric ship Ericsson|Caloric ship Ericsson]].
[[File:John Ericsson Memorial detail.jpg|thumb|John Ericsson National Memorial at Washington, D.C.]]

==USS ''Monitor''==
[[File:Monitor model2.jpg|thumb|286px|Replica of USS ''Monitor'']]
{{Main|USS Monitor}}
Shortly after the [[American Civil War]] broke out in 1861, the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] began constructing an ironclad ram upon the hull of {{USS|Merrimack|1855|6}} which had been partially burned and then sunk by Federal troops before it was captured by forces loyal to the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]]. Nearly concurrently, the [[United States Congress]] had recommended in August 1861 that armored ships be built for the American Navy. Ericsson still had a dislike for the U.S. Navy, but he was nevertheless convinced by Lincoln's hard-working Secretary of the Navy [[Gideon Welles]], and [[Cornelius Scranton Bushnell]] to submit an ironclad ship design to them. Ericsson later presented drawings of {{USS|Monitor}}, a novel design of armored ship which included a rotating turret housing a pair of large cannons. Despite controversy over the unique design, based on Swedish lumber rafts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Burke|title=The civil war: strange &amp; fascinating facts|date=1982|publisher=Fairfax Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0517371510|page=145|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; the keel was eventually laid down and the ironclad was launched on March 6, 1862. The ship went from plans to launch in approximately 100 days, an amazing achievement.

On March 8, the former USS ''Merrimack'', rechristened {{ship|CSS|Virginia}}, was wreaking havoc on the wooden Union Blockading Squadron in Virginia, sinking {{USS|Congress|1841|6}} and {{USS|Cumberland|1842|6}}. ''Monitor'' appeared the next day, initiating the first battle between ironclad warships on March 9, 1862, at [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]]. The battle ended in a tactical stalemate between the two ironclad warships, neither of which appeared capable of sinking the other, but strategically saved the remaining Union fleet from defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=     https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=15375|title= John Ericsson|publisher =   Svenskt biografiskt lexikon |accessdate= September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, numerous [[Monitor warship type|monitors]] were built for the Union, including twin turret versions, and contributed greatly to the naval victory of the Union over the rebellious states. Despite their low draft and subsequent problems in navigating in high seas, many basic design elements of the ''Monitor'' class were copied in future warships by other designers and navies. The rotating turret in particular is considered one of the greatest technological advances in naval history, still found on warships today.

==Later designs==
Later Ericsson designed other naval vessels and weapons, including a type of [[torpedo]] and a [[destroyer]], a [[torpedo boat]] that could fire a cannon from an underwater port.  He also provided some technical support for [[John Philip Holland]] in his early submarine experiments. In the book ''Contributions to the Centennial Exhibition'' (1877, reprinted 1976) he presented his "sun engines", which collected solar heat for a [[hot air engine]].  One of these designs earned Ericsson additional income after being converted to work as a methane gas engine.

==Death and ensuing controversy==
Ericsson died on March 8, 1889, the anniversary of the Battle of Hampton Roads, in which his ''Monitor'' famously played a central role.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Church|Church, 1911]], p. ii.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The White Squadron's Farewell Salute to the Body of John Ericsson, New York Bay, August 23, 1890.jpg|thumb|200px|The White Squadron's Farewell Salute to the Body of John Ericsson, New York Bay, August 23, 1890]]
His wish to be buried in his native land sparked a series of articles from New York Times alleging that, by selecting the third-rate {{USS|Essex|1874}} to transport his remains, the US Navy was not paying proper respect to Ericsson.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/07/13/103252368.pdf A Hero's Memory Slighted]", NY Times, July 13, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy responded and sent the remains on the {{USS|Baltimore|C-3|6}}, escorted by other ships such as {{USS|Nantucket|1862|6}}. On August 23, 1890, the fleet departed with a twenty-one gun salute and the Swedish flag set at half mast.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/08/20/103260018.pdf Honour to Capt. Ericsson]", NY Times, August 20, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 100,000 people turned out for the funeral procession and departure ceremonies, including several veterans of the USS ''Monitor''.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/08/24/103261223.pdf Back To His Native Land]", ''The New York Times'', August 24, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon arrival in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, the fleet was under presidential order to shoot a twenty-one gun salute to the Swedish flag, leave the remains, and immediately return to sea.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/08/19/106041308.pdf To Salute Sweden's Flag]", ''The New York Times'', August 19, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

His final resting place is at [[Filipstad]], in [[Värmland]].

==Legacy==
Although none of his inventions created any large industries, he is regarded as one of the most influential mechanical engineers ever and without a doubt the best naval engineer in America in the 19th century.

[[File:John Block (1985).jpg|thumb|John Block (1985)]]
'''Johan Nicolaas Block''' (May 18, 1929, [[Amsterdam]] &amp;ndash; April 11, 1994) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] aviation pioneer. He was the co-founder of [[Martinair]], founder of [[Transavia]] and [[Air Holland]].

John Block was born as the son of a schoolteacher in Amsterdam. After [[World War II]] he applied for a job with [[KLM]] but wasn't hired. He joined the Dutch airforce and became an [[aviator|airforce pilot]]. After his service he briefly worked with a radio division of the Dutch postal services and obtained his commercial aviation licence. Together with [[Martin Schröder (Martinair)|Martin Schröder]] he founded Martinair. They introduced leisure travel by plane in the Netherlands. Block left the company in 1965 and shortly after bought the 'sleeping' airline Transavia Limburg which he renamed to Transavia. he built up the airline from scratch and ten years later Transavia had a marketshare of 45% of the Dutch holiday market. After a quarrel with some investors Block left Transavia in 1975.
He went on and founded the small company Jetstar Holland BV in 1977. As such he introduced the use of executive jet travel in the Netherlands. He sold the company soon after to an investment holding and went back to the larger scheme: in 1984 he founded the airline Air Holland that went public in 1989.
Block left Air Holland in 1991 and died in 1994.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12470">'''Jurisdictional arbitrage''' is the practice of taking advantage of the discrepancies between competing legal [[jurisdiction]]s. It takes its name from [[arbitrage]], the practice in [[finance]] of purchasing a good at a lower price in one market and selling it at a higher price in another. Just as in financial arbitrage, the attractiveness of jurisdiction arbitrage depends largely on its [[transaction cost]]s, here the costs of switching legal service providers from one [[government]] to another.&lt;ref name=dyn&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The lower the [[Departure tax|exit costs]] for leaving the jurisdiction (unrestricted emigration, cheap travel, [[liquidity]] of assets) the more desirable and feasible it is. Conversely, high [[entry cost]]s into the more favourable jurisdiction are an inhibitor on jurisdictional arbitrage; certain [[tax haven]]s such as [[Andorra]] grant permanent residency rights to immigrants only if they meet certain criteria. Jurisdictional arbitrage is a significant concept in modern free market [[anarcho-capitalism]], not to be confused with [[anarchism]] per se.

== Applications ==
The practice of individuals [[asylum seeker|seeking asylum]] involves appealing to a jurisdiction with favorable individual rights for residency, where the individual's native jurisdiction is seen to offer insufficient protection. For example, women have fled West African nations which practice tribal [[female genital mutilation]] and/or [[Wahhabism|extremist Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;No interpretation of Islam demands female circumcision, contrary to popular opinion. See ''Reliance of the Traveller and Tools of the Worshipper (Umdat al-Salik)'', trans. Nuh Ha Mim Keller&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of [[Europe]]an and [[North America]]n jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;

To avoid arbitrary restrictions on skilled immigration, high-tech companies may set up offices in countries neighboring those with the restrictive policies, preferably in locations close to the border, as was the case with [[Microsoft]]'s plans to open a satellite office in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft pressures U.S. in Vancouver move |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=3a2cbdc5-95ad-45b5-9fb1-fe1fb3656f37&amp;k=23394 |publisher=[[National Post]] |accessdate=2012-03-02 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65rMazlyZ?url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=3a2cbdc5-95ad-45b5-9fb1-fe1fb3656f37 |archivedate=2012-03-02 |date=2007-07-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; situated only 140 miles (225&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Microsoft Redmond Campus|its headquarters]] in the [[Seattle]] suburb of [[Redmond, Washington]] in the United States.

On the other hand, jurisdictional arbitrage has also been utilized to hinder attempts at governmental prosecution, by transnational criminals such as [[terrorists]],&lt;ref&gt;"Anti-terror measures hit formal finance", ''[[Oxford Analytica]]'', 2004-05-25. Retrieved 2008-02-29.

Prior to recent international mobilization against the practice, there existed a long-standing tradition of ousted state leaders such as [[Erich Honecker]], [[Idi Amin]] and [[Augusto Pinochet]] finding refuge and retirement abroad to avoid prosecution in their native jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Universal Jurisdiction: National Courts and the Prosecution of Serious Crimes Under International Law|editor=Stephen Macedo |date=February 1, 2006 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1950-3|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinochet, one-time military leader of [[Chile]] sought to evade retributive prosecution in his native jurisdiction by seeking refuge in the [[United Kingdom]]. He was later prosecuted by a [[Spain|Spanish]] court according to the principle of [[universal jurisdiction]].

To counteract this phenomenon, most countries have signed bilateral [[extradition]] treaties with most other countries, and some governments adopted the principle of universal jurisdiction, which has enabled individuals to be prosecuted for offences (particularly alleged [[human rights]] violations and [[war crime]]s) committed outside the jurisdiction of prosecution &amp;ndash; the legal structure of nations such as [[Belgium]] and [[Spain]] allow for this, as does that of international tribunals operating under the aegis of the [[United Nations]].

A similar attempt at governmental collusion to limit the use of jurisdictional arbitrage for [[tax avoidance]] is the policy of [[tax harmonization]]. The membership of European governments in the [[European Union]] resulted in a collection of nations with a limited set of common legal structures ([[Four Freedoms (European Union)|Four Freedoms]]) which has resulted in  [[tax competition]] by the otherwise less-developed nations (such as the [[Republic of Ireland]] in the early 1990s) whereby governments compete for [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] by lowering their tax rates significantly below those of their neighbours. This strategy has been adopted in the form of a [[flat tax]] by various Eastern European nations, which has resulted in calls for harmonization of tax rates by the traditionally more developed nations such as [[France]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[seasteading]] is an attempt to increase the possibility of jurisdictional arbitrage by decreasing the cost of switching governments. It is worth noting that there is nothing [[anarchist]] about jurisdictional arbitrage, since it is a strategy based on profiting from the differences between regulatory regimes, and therefore incompatible with the abolition of the state.

A notable proponent and practitioner of jurisdictional arbitrage is Canadian businessman and [[perpetual traveler]]  [[Calvin Ayre]], founder of [[online gambling]] consortium Bodog Entertainment Group.&lt;ref name=ayre&gt;{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Bashir |title=Online Gambling Mogul Living it Up |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=2108601&amp;page=1 |work=[[ABC News]] |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=2006-07-07 |accessdate=2008-02-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although online gambling is illegal in the [[United States]], a market which accounts for 95% of Bodog's sales, the company pays no [[corporate tax]]es there as its activities are distributed across different jurisdictions to minimise tax burden. "We run a business that can't actually be described as gambling in each country we operate in. But when you add it all together, it’s Internet gambling."&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Miller |title=Catch Me If You Can |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2006/0327/112_print.html |work=[[Forbes]] |date=2006-03-27 |accessdate=2008-02-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonides Sarao Virata''' (April 22, 1918 - July 14, 1976) was a Filipino [[economist]].  During his lifetime, he served as [[executive officer]] of various government and private companies in the country.  He was appointed the Secretary of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (Philippines)|Department of Commerce and Industry]] from 1969-1970 and then Chairman of the [[Development Bank of the Philippines]] from 1970 till his death in 1976.  He hailed from the city of [[Imus]] in [[Cavite]] province.

== Early life and education ==

Leonides Sarao Virata was born on April 22, 1918 in [[Barangay|Brgy.]] Medicion II, Imus, Cavite to Luis Virata and Agapita Sarao. According to family members, the original family name was Bautista.  Sometime during the 1896 [[Philippine revolution]], a forebear changed the surname to Virata, taking the name of the character [[Virata Kingdom|King Virata]] from the Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''. His elder half-brother, Dr. [[Enrique Topacio Virata]] (who married Leonor Aguinaldo, daughter of Gen. [[Baldomero Aguinaldo]]) was the father of [[Cesar Virata]], the former [[Prime Minister of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=remembrance&gt;[http://remembranceofthingsawry.wordpress.com/2010/07/page/3/ "The Families of Old Cavite"]. Remembrance of Things Awry. Retrieved on 2013-07-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Virata was also a relative of [[Leonardo S. Sarao]], an automotive designer and founder of [[Sarao Motors]], the maker of [[jeepney]]s known internationally as a symbol of Filipino culture.

Virata obtained his [[Law degree]] in 1940 and Business Administration degree, ''[[cum laude]]'', in 1941, both courses from the [[University of the Philippines]]. He did [[graduate school|graduate]] work at the [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Chicago]], and [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref name=Quirino&gt;Quirino, Carlos. Who’s Who in Philippine History. Manila: Tahanan Books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Virata was in the United States when the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] was evacuated to America because of the raging [[Pacific war|war in the Pacific]]. From 1946 to 1948, he worked as an officer of the [[Philippine Embassy]] in the US. After the war, the task of directing the economic research of the newly organized [[Central Bank of the Philippines]] in 1949 fell on him. Subsequently, he was appointed as the bank’s deputy governor and later, as a member of the Monetary Board.  In various [[United Nations]] conferences on finance, trade, industry and economics; Virata served in different capacities.  He was the adviser to the Philippine delegate to the [[International Monetary Fund]] Conference at [[Washington, DC]] in 1949 and to the International Monetary Fund and International Bank Conference at Paris, France in 1950.  He was a delegate of the Philippines to the Conference of the Consultative Committee in Economic Development in Southeast Asia under the Colombo plan in Ceylon in 1957.

In 1952, he left the government service and joined the [[Philippine American Life and General Insurance Company]] as financial vice-president and vice-chairman of its investment committee. Soon, he was accorded the same respect he earned during his service with the government. He was elected either as chairman, president or board member of various companies involved in insurance, food processing, marketing, oil exploration, plywood manufacture, logging, textile, meat packing, glass making, oil refining, banking, telecommunications, etc. His leadership in business and industry reached its peak when he was elected president of the Philippine Chamber of Industries and the Management Association of the Philippines.  He was also attributed to the successful transfer of the [[Manila Electric Company]] to Filipino control from [[General Public Utilities]] of the United States, and the Filipinization of the [[Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company]].&lt;ref name=Quirino/&gt;

He became a member of the Joint Legislative Executive Tax Commission in 1966. From 1969 to 1970, [[President Marcos]] appointed him as Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Industry (now the [[Department of Trade and Industry (Philippines)|Department of Trade and Industry]]). In 1970, he was appointed chairman of the [[Development Bank of the Philippines]].  Upon assuming his position as Chairman of DBP, he ordered the investigation of several major firms that failed to pay the DBP millions of pesos in overdue obligations.  Because of this, he was considered as one of the radical chairmen the DBP ever had.  Also as head of the DBP, he helped agricultural and industrial enterprises through sound financing schemes. He was also responsible for orienting the institutional objective of development to the countryside to insure that the rural people would enjoy the benefits of economic growth.

== Death ==

On July 14, 1976, Chairman Virata died in Houston, Texas, where he was treated of a lingering illness, leaving his wife the former Marie Theresa “Bebe”
Gallardo Lammoglia, and two children, Luis Juan Virata (married Elizabeth Torres Cu-Unjieng) and Giovanna “Vanna” Virata.&lt;ref name=remembrance/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quirino/&gt;

JV de Ocampo assumed Virata’s unfinished term at the DBP. In honoring Virata, Chairman de Ocampo said: “In the death of Chairman Leonides Virata, we have lost a
esteemed leader in the country’s economic life. He was a force in our development direction…. Chairman Virata was an articulate exponent of an economic strategy
designed to improve the quality of life of our people and he gave of himself liberally to this pursuits toward the end. Shortly before his death, he sought to give deeper and massive meaning to the DBP’s countryside development program which he himself initiated in line with national policy.”&lt;ref name=Quirino/&gt;

== Honors and awards ==

* In 1963, the [[Philippine Women's University]] awarded him an honorary doctorate degree.
* In recognition of his long and distinguished service to the country in the fields of banking, finance, trade and industry, which spanned a period of 33 years, President Marcos posthumously conferred on him the [[Presidential Merit Medal]].&lt;ref name=Quirino/&gt;
* The [[Leonides S. Virata Memorial School]] (LSVMS) in Palawan was named after him.

'''''Monopoly Tycoon''''' is a [[construction and management simulation]] PC game published in 2001. The player operates a business that owns stores and apartments in a city derived from the [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] board game. Instead of using [[dice]], the game relies more on the speed and innovativeness of the players. In the standard mode, the user plays against the AI opponents. In the [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] version, players go against other [[online]] players in order to gain victory.

There are various levels with varying difficulty. Some involve just financial prosperity of the businesses while others involve success in the political arena. But the primary objective of most levels is to accumulate the most wealth in the given time.

==Gameplay==
In ''Monopoly Tycoon'', the player operates a business by owning businesses, apartments, and being landlord to blocks. The player earns income from selling products and services, housing people in apartments and hotels. Income is also generated from rent for any blocks that the player is landlord of, plus utilities and railroads.

''Monopoly Tycoon'' has the same set of blocks as the board game with an additional three. When a player is landlord of all blocks of the same color, they are able to build hotels. In addition, being landlord of any property allows the player to build park space.

As in the board game, there are railroads and utilities blocks that players can become landlord of and receive income from. To become landlord, there is an auction among the players with the property going to the highest bidder.

At the end of the day, the player is offered a mystery card similar to those from the board game. Some of the cards are a simple deposit or withdrawal of money from the player's account. Other cards allow the player to aid his businesses or harm the opponent, say by restocking one of his stores or giving an opponent block bad publicity.

Monopoly Tycoon also includes support for multiplayer game play over a [[Local area network|LAN]] or Internet connection. Additionally, there is support for finding live online opponents through the included [[GameSpy|GameSpy Arcade]] software.[[Image:Montycoon screenshot.jpg|200px|thumb|Examining the status of one of your businesses during a game. On the left side you have the summary of its income, profit, sales, etc.]]

==Music and sound effects==
The music of the game is lighthearted and changes as the game progresses through the different decades. For example, in the 1970s (1970 and 1975 Monopoly Tycoon years), music from the 1970s can be heard; in 1990 and 1995, 1990s music plays. This music will play until the year 2030 is reached (this year can only be reached in the "My Mega Metropolis" level, "Starting Out", "A Homely City", "Sell, Sell, Sell", and the "First to be Worth $20,000, $25,000, or $40,000" levels). At that point, music from the 1930s can be heard from then on.

After every two days at midnight, the music from the previous decade becomes quieter and quickly fades away, while the music from the next decade starts at normal volume. For example, when midnight of 1960 occurs, the music from the 1950s fades away and the music from the 1960s plays at normal volume.

Other sounds indicate the time of day. People, cars, and the wind all make noises, in varying degrees depending on the time of day. For example, during the morning, footsteps of people waking up and coming out of their apartments is played to signify the time the city wakes up. Throughout the game, also, the sound of coins falling can be heard when the player makes money.

''Monopoly Tycoon'' received generally positive reviews from critics.

The developers of the game, however, were critical of their work saying that "I don’t think we got it entirely right either."&lt;ref name=rps /&gt;

The [[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] nominated ''Monopoly Tycoon'' for its 2001 "Online Game Play of the Year" and "Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering" awards,&lt;ref name=aias2001-2&gt;{{cite press release |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020602183409/http://www.interactive.org/newsandevents.asp?show=138&amp;thetype=1 |url=http://www.interactive.org:80/newsandevents.asp?show=138&amp;thetype=1 |title=Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences Announces Finalists for the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards |date=February 5, 2002 |publisher=[[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] |archivedate=June 2, 2002 |deadurl=yes |df= |location=[[Los Angeles]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which ultimately went to ''[[Return to Castle Wolfenstein]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'', respectively.&lt;ref name=aias2001&gt;{{cite press release |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020306070041/http://www.interactive.org/newsandevents.asp |url=http://www.interactive.org:80/newsandevents.asp |title=Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences Announces Recipients of Fifth Annual Interactive Achievement Awards |date=March 1, 2002 |publisher=[[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] |archivedate=March 6, 2002 |deadurl=yes |df= |location=[[Las Vegas]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Monopoly Tycoon'' was also a nominee for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s 2001 "Best Strategy Game" award, although it lost to ''[[Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns]]''.

==Biography==
Bensusan was born in [[Tangier, Morocco]] and raised in [[Spain]]. He migrated to [[South Florida]] in the [[United States]] in 2007.

===Liberty Grande / Logictech ===
Shortly after moving to Florida, Bensusan formed a real estate development company, Liberty Grande, LLC, in 2009.&lt;ref name="Musibay"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/print-edition/2013/05/10/costa-hollywood-slated-to-break-ground.html?page=all  |title= Costa Hollywood slated to break ground in Q2 |date=10 May 2013 |first= Oscar Pedro |last=Musibay |publisher= South Florida Business Journal |accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, Bensusan's company acquired the Logictech Construction Group, a development and general contractor. Logictech was later named one of the top 25 construction companies in South Florida by South Florida Business Journal in 2012.&lt;ref name="SFBJ"/&gt; The group now consists of a team of design and construction professionals. Bensusan serves as CEO of Liberty Grande and Logictech.&lt;ref name="Riches"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.fortlauderdaleriches.com/2013/03/costa-hollywood.html |title=Costa Hollywood |date=22 March 2013 |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costa Hollywood village===
Bensusan, through his companies Liberty Grande and Logictech, acquired property for the development of a residential community, Costa Hollywood Village, in South Florida.&lt;ref name=Bryan&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-02-08/news/fl-costa-hollywood-20130208_1_condo-hotel-synagogue-upscale-resort |title=Coming soon to Hollywood, FL: Upscale resort with a synagogue |date=8 February 2013 |first=Susannah |last=Bryan |publisher=Sun Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.remonline.com/florida-development-attracting-canadian-buyers/ |title=Florida development attracting Canadian buyers |date=1 November 2013 |accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project broke ground in June 2013.&lt;ref name="Satchell"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.davincirealtygroup.com/developer-breaks-ground-on-hollywood-condo-resort/ |title=Developer breaks ground on Hollywood condo-resort |accessdate=22 April 2014 |first=Arlene |last=Satchell |publisher=Sun Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially slated to be completed in 2016, the project will consist of over 307 condo resorts plus restaurants and other amenities&lt;ref name="Schmall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hemlock"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-08-08/news/fl-hollywood-beach-project-20120807_1_condo-hotel-hollywood-beach-margaritaville |title=Developers envision European-style village for Hollywood beach |date=8 August 2012 |first= Doreen |last=Hemlock |publisher=Sun Sentinel |accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Parcel audit''' (also referred to as '''small package auditing''' or '''small parcel auditing''') is the process of reviewing shipping invoices for invalid charges and other billing inaccuracies. Each shipment tendered to a major parcel carrier like UPS and FedEx come with service guarantees outlined within each carrier's tariff or service guide. An increasing number of businesses contract third-party companies to perform these services because they have the technology necessary to automate the otherwise time consuming process.

==Parcel invoices==
Parcel carriers like [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[FedEx]], and [[DHL Express|DHL]] often have large, long, and complicated invoices. A customer shipping a high volume of parcel boxes via one of these carriers sees invoices hundreds of pages long. The invoices show a high amount of visibility to how a package was carried and delivered. This finite data is collected by UPS and FedEx for tracking purposes and to automate the process of charging the appropriate amount to their clients.

==Invoicing process: errors and overbills==
The invoicing process is so automated that mistakes happen often. Insiders to UPS and FedEx claim that little focus is spent to prevent billing for inappropriate charges: duplicate charges, incorrect [[discounts and allowances|discount]] amounts, and phantom accessorial charges. Invoicing errors are a common phenomenon, and most large carriers provide teams and electronic forms to contest improper charges on invoices. With the proper data to dispute the charges, they are often credited in a matter of hours.&lt;ref&gt;Parcel audit invoice mistakes, https://www.controlpay.com/blog/small-parcel-audit-invoice-mistakes-you-can-expect-shipper&lt;/ref&gt;

Overbilling - or service failures - is a larger problem than invoicing errors. A service failure occurs when a package with a time-sensitive guarantee is delivered late and a refund is due to the client. Most carriers like UPS and FedEx place the responsibility on the customer to check the timeliness of the delivered package. Once the service failure is found, the carrier typically credits the amount due quickly. The terms and conditions for claiming a late package are stated and the act of claiming a refund is also time-sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.controlpay.com/blog/5-effective-ways-reduce-parcel-shipping-costs 5 effective ways to reduce parcel shipping costs - ControlPay]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published savings rates==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
Up to 5% of a clients UPS and/or FedEx charges are due to errors or overbilled items. This results in around $2&amp;nbsp;billion of unclaimed refunds.

==How to implement audit==
Customers forward their electronic billing file or approve their carriers to send the electronic billing files directly to the auditor. Most auditors accept all forms of electronic billing files. Customers may request these files from their carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Cost Recovery, "Parcel Audit [http://tcrecovery.com/small-parcel-management/]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition in the parcel audit industry==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
The parcel auditing industry, otherwise knows as small package audit, has been growing in popularity. Most auditors operate using a performance-based model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17600">'''Post-Fordism''' is the dominant system of [[economic production]], [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], and associated socio-economic phenomena in most [[industrialized]] countries since the late 20th century. It is contrasted with [[Fordism]], the system formulated in [[Henry Ford]]'s automotive factories, in which workers work on a [[production line]], performing specialized tasks repetitively, and in which his workers could afford the products they built. Definitions of the nature and scope of post-Fordism vary considerably and are a matter of debate among scholars. Changes in the nature of the workforce include the shift of emphasis to new information technologies and the rise of the service and the [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] worker.

== Overview ==
Post-Fordism is characterized by the following attributes:&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S. (October 1988) "Brave new world." ''Marxism Today'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Small-batch production
*[[Economies of scope]]
*Specialized products and jobs
*New information technologies
*Emphasis on types of consumers in contrast to previous emphasis on social class
*The rise of the service and the [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] worker
*The [[Feminisation of the workplace|feminisation of the work force]]

== Theories ==

Post-Fordism can be applied in a wider context to describe a whole system of modern social processes. Because post-Fordism describes the world as it is today, various thinkers have different views of its form and implications. As the theory continues to evolve, it is commonly divided into three schools of thought: the Regulation School, Flexible Specialization, and Neo-Schumpeterianism.

===Regulation School===
The [[regulation theory|Regulation approach]] (also called the neo-[[Marxist]] or French Regulation School), was designed to address the paradox of how [[capitalism]] has both a tendency towards crisis, change and instability as well as an ability to stabilize institutions, rules and norms. The theory is based on two key concepts. "Regimes of Accumulation" refer to systems of production and consumption, such as Fordism and post-Fordism. "Modes of Regulation" refer to the written and unwritten laws of society which control the Regime of Accumulation and determine its form.

According to Regulation theory, every Regime of Accumulation will reach a crisis point at which the Mode of Regulation will no longer support it, and society will be forced to find new rules and norms, forming a new Mode of Regulation. This will begin a new Regime of Accumulation, which will eventually reach a crisis, and so forth. Proponents of Regulation theory include [[Michel Aglietta]], [[Robert Boyer (economic historian)|Robert Boyer]], [[Bob Jessop]], and [[Alain Lipietz]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nilges|Nilges 2008]]:&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flexible specialization===

Proponents of the flexible Specialization approach (also known as the neo-Smithian approach) to post-Fordism believe that fundamental changes in the international economy, especially in the early 1970s, forced firms to switch from mass production to a new tactic known as Flexible Specialization. Factors such as the oil shocks of 1973, increased competition from foreign markets (especially Southeast Asia) due to globalization, the end of the post-World War II boom, and increasing privatization made the old system of mass-producing identical, cheap goods through division of labor uncompetitive.

Instead of producing generic goods, firms now found it more profitable to produce diverse product lines targeted at different groups of consumers, appealing to their sense of taste and fashion. Instead of investing huge amounts of money on the mass production of a single product, firms now needed to build intelligent systems of labor and machines that were flexible and could quickly respond to the whims of the market. The technology originally associated with flexible production was the [[numerical control]] technology, which was developed in the United States in the 1950s; however, the CNC, developed in Japan, later replaced it. The development of the computer was very important to the technology of flexible specialization. Not only could the computer change characteristics of the goods being produced, but it could also analyze data to order supplies and produce goods in accordance with current demand. These types of technology made adjustments simple and inexpensive, making smaller specialized production runs economically feasible. Flexibility and skill in the labor was also important. The workforce was now divided into a skill-flexible core and a time-flexible periphery. Flexibility and variety in the skills and knowledge of the core workers and the machines used for production allowed for the specialized production of goods. Modern just in time manufacturing is one example of a flexible approach to production.

Likewise, the production structure began to change on the sector level. Instead of a single firm manning the assembly line from raw materials to finished product, the production process became fragmented as individual firms specialized on their areas of expertise. As evidence for this theory of specialization, proponents claim that Marshallian "industrial districts," or clusters of integrated firms, have developed in places like Silicon Valley, Jutland, Småland, and several parts of Italy.

===Neo-Schumpeterianism===
The Neo-[[Joseph Schumpeter#Business_cycles|Schumpeterian]] approach to post-Fordism is based upon the theory of [[Kondratiev wave|Kondratiev waves]] (also known as long waves). The theory holds that a "techno-economic paradigm" (Perez) characterizes each long wave. [[Fordism]] was the techno-economic paradigm of the fourth Kondratiev wave, and post-Fordism is thus the techno-economic paradigm of the fifth, which is dominated by information and communication technology.

Notable Neo-Schumpeterian thinkers comprise [[Carlota Perez]] and [[Christopher Freeman]], as well as [[Michael Storper]] and Richard Walker.

===Post-Fordist theory in Italy===
In Italy, post-Fordism has been theorised by the long wave of [[workerism]] or [[autonomia]]. Major thinkers of this tendency include the Swiss-Italian economist {{ill|Christian Marazzi|fr}}, [[Antonio Negri]], [[Paolo Virno]], [[Carlo Vercellone]], [[Maurizio Lazzarato]]. Marazzi's ''Capital and Language'' takes as its starting point the fact that the extreme volatility of financial markets is generally attributed to the discrepancy between the "real economy" (that of material goods produced and sold) and the more speculative monetary-financial economy. But this distinction has long ceased to apply in the post-Fordist New Economy, in which both spheres are structurally affected by language and communication. In ''Capital and Language'' Marazzi argues that the changes in financial markets and the transformation of labor into immaterial labor (that is, its reliance on abstract knowledge, general intellect, and social cooperation) are two sides of a new development paradigm: financialization through and thanks to the rise of the new economy.

In terms of the development of the 'technical and political class-composition', in the post-Fordist era the crisis explains at the same time 'high points of the capitalist development' and how new technological tools develop and work altogether (money form, linguistic conventions, capital and language). [Zanini, A. 2010, 'On the Philosophical Foundations of Italian Workerism: A Conceptual Approach', Historical Materialism, 18, 4: 39-63.]

==Changes from Fordism to post-Fordism==
Post-Fordism brought on new ways of looking at consumption and production. The saturation of key markets brought on a turn against mass consumption and a pursuit of higher living standards.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Milani|Milani 2000]]: 33-35&lt;/ref&gt; This shift brought a change in how the market was viewed from a production standpoint. Rather than being viewed as a mass market to be served by [[mass production]], the consumers began to be viewed as different groups pursuing different goals who could be better served with small batches of specialized goods&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kumar|Kumar 1995]]: 43&lt;/ref&gt; Mass markets became less important while markets for luxury, custom, or [[positional good]] became more significant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Milani|Milani 2000]]: 35&lt;/ref&gt; Production became less homogeneous and standardized and more diverse and differentiated as organizations and economies of scale were replaced with organizations and economies of scope.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kumar|Kumar 1995]]: 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes in production with the shift from [[Fordism]] to post-Fordism were accompanied by changes in the economy, politics, and prominent ideologies. In the economic realm, post-Fordism brought the decline of regulation and production by the nation-state and the rise of global markets and corporations. [[Mass marketing]] was replaced by flexible specialization, and organizations began to emphasize communication more than command. The workforce changed with an increase in internal marketing, franchising, and subcontracting and a rise in part-time, temp, self-employed, and home workers. Politically, class-based political parties declined and social movements based on region, gender, or race increased. Mass unions began to vanish and were instead replaced by localized plant-based bargaining. Cultural and ideological changes included the rise in individualist modes of thought and behavior and a culture of entrepreneurialism. Following the shift in production and acknowledging the need for more knowledge-based workers, education became less standardized and more specialized. Prominent ideologies that arose included fragmentation and pluralism in values, post-modern eclecticism, and populist approaches to culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kumar|Kumar 1995]]: 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Italy===
One of the primary examples of specialized post-Fordist production took place in a region known as the Third [[Italy]]. The First Italy included the areas of large-scale mass production, such as [[Turin]], [[Milan]], and [[Genoa]], and the Second Italy described the undeveloped South. The Third Italy, however, was where clusters of small firms and workshops developed in the 1970s and 1980s in the central and northeast regions of the country. Regions of the Third Italy included [[Tuscany]], Umbria, Marche, [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Veneto]], [[Friuli]], and [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]]. Each region specialized in a range of loosely related products and each workshop usually had five to fifty workers and often less than ten. The range of products in each region reflected the post-Fordist shift to economies of scope. Additionally, these workshops were known for producing high quality products and employing highly skilled, well-paid workers. The workshops were very design-oriented and multidisciplinary, involving collaboration between entrepreneurs, designers, engineers and workers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kumar|Kumar 1995]]: 37-39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
There were several post-[[World War II]] changes in production in [[Japan]] that caused post-Fordist conditions to develop. First, there were changes to company structure, including the replacement of independent trade unions with pro-management, company-based unions; the development of a core of permanent male multi-skilled workers; and the development of a periphery of untrained temporary and part-time employees, who were mostly female. Second, after World War II, Japan was somewhat isolated because of import barriers and foreign investment restrictions, and as a result, Japan began to experiment with production techniques. Third, as imported technologies became more available, Japan began to replicate, absorb, and improve them, with many improvements deriving from modifications for local conditions. Fourth, Japan began to concentrate on the need for small-batch production and quick changeover of product lines to serve the demand for a wide range of products in a relatively small market. Because of informal [[price-fixing]], competition was based not on price but rather on product differentiation. As a result, production became less standardized and more specialized, particularly across different companies. Fifth, Japan began to build long-term supply and subcontracting networks, which contrasted with the vertically integrated, Fordist American corporations. Sixth, because small and medium-size manufacturers produced a wide range of products, there was a need for affordable multipurpose equipment as opposed to the specialized, costly production machinery in Fordist industries in the [[United States]]. Technology for flexible production was significant in Japan and particularly necessary for smaller producers. The smaller producers also found it necessary to reduce costs. As a result, Japan became one of the main users of [[robots]] and [[Numerical control|CNC]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernard|Bernard 2000]]: 154-156&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, these six changes in production in Japan were institutionalized.

==Criticisms==
The main criticism of post-Fordism asserts that post-Fordism mistakes the nature of the Fordist revolution and that Fordism was not in crisis, but was simply evolving and will continue to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kumar|Kumar 1995]]: 60&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics believe that post-Fordism does exist, but coexists with Fordism. The [[automobile]] industry has combined Fordist and post-Fordist strategies,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kiely|Kiely 1998]]: 109&lt;/ref&gt; using both mass production and flexible specialization. Ford introduced flexibility into mass production, so that Fordism could continue to evolve. Those who advocate post-Fordism, however, note that criticism that focuses primarily on flexible specialization ignores post-Fordist changes in other areas of life and that flexible specialization cannot be looked at alone when examining post-Fordism. Another criticism is that post-Fordism relies too heavily on the examples of the Third Italy and Japan. Some believe that Japan is neither Fordist nor post-Fordist and that [[vertical disintegration]] and mass production go hand in hand.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kumar|Kumar 1995]]: 58-65&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the new, smaller firms in Italy didn’t develop autonomously, but are a product of the vertical disintegration of the large Fordist firms who contracted lower value-added work to smaller enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kiely|Kiely 1998]]: 101&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms argue that flexible specialization is not happening on any great scale, and smaller firms have always existed alongside mass production. Another main criticism is that we are too much in the midst to judge whether or not there really is a new system of production.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kumar|Kumar 1995]]: 168&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "post-Fordism" is gradually giving way in the literature to a series of alternative terms such as the [[knowledge economy]], [[cognitive capitalism]], the [[cognitive-cultural economy]] and so on. This change of vocabulary is also associated with a number of important conceptual shifts (see sections above).

'''''Professional Builder''''' is a trade publication and website serving the information needs of the housing and light construction marketplace.

==History and profile==
Established in 1936, ''Professional Builder'' magazine is published monthly with two additional issues in the fall (usually mid September or October) and December.  The fall issue is called the Builder's Own Issue, which provides a look at the homes that builders build for themselves and the products they have chosen. The December issue focuses on the International Builders' Show, which previews products from the event.

For over 40 years, ''Professional Builder'' selected a home builder who has paved the way for the rest of the industry. Every year, the magazine awarded this group the title Builder of the Year; 2007's winner was [[Shea Homes]].

As of December 2007, total [[BPA Worldwide|BPA]] audited circulation was 125,286 subscribers.

In 2010 [[Reed Business Information]] closed the magazine.&lt;ref name="nhs"/&gt; However, it was relaunched by Scranton Gillette Communications.&lt;ref name="nhs"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Home Guide  Authors  Susan Bady|url=https://www.newhomesource.com/resourcecenter/authors/susan-bady|accessdate=19 January 2017|work=New Home Source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2658">'''Rasmus Sigvardt''' (born 26 February 1886) was a mechanic from [[Orehoved]] on the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Falster]]. In 1904, he opened a cycle repair shop which later developed into an engine factory, specializing in boat motors and mechanized fruit-tree sprayers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://falstershistorie.dk/orehoved.html "Orehoved"], Falsters historie. {{da icon}} Retrieved 16 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

The little workshop Sigvardt opened in 1904 was only {{Convert|120|sqft}} but in 1906 he expanded it to {{Convert|450|sqft}}. Around that time, when motorcycles came to Denmark, he was one of the first to obtain the tools he needed for their maintenance and repair. In 1909, he built even larger facilities, where he and his staff of three could repair automobiles, motorcycles and boat motors.&lt;ref name=motorsam&gt;[http://www.motorsamlingen.dk/wordpress/motorfabrikker/orehoved-motorfabrik-danmark/ "Orehoved Motorfabrik, Danmark"], Dansk Motor- og Maskinsamling. {{da icon}} Retrieved 16 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, the factory began to manufacture two-stroke [[glow fuel]] or gasoline engines to serve as boat motors. They were marketed as R. S. M. Motorer from R. Sigvardts Motorfabrik. By the 1920s, Sigvardt was manufacturing even more sophisticated engines, always keeping up to date with developments. In 1926, he began manufacturing spraying equipment for fields and gardens, marketing Denmark's first mechanized sprayer by the end of the same year. By that time he was employing 14 workmen. He also made a success of stationary engines for winching. While continuing his engine business, he later also moved into radios which he assembled himself until he met competition from larger manufacturers.&lt;ref name=motorsam/&gt;

In 1936, Sigvardt organized the ''Brohallen'' bridge exhibition in Orehoved in connection with the building of the [[Storstrøm Bridge]]. In 1951, he had 12 houses built in the town for his factory employees. In 1970, the Sigvardt factory was taken over by Hardi International. It has now moved to Nørre Alslev where it is the town's largest employer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-online.dk/kulturm_rapport/Nr_Alslev.pdf "375-1 Gåbense"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502132122/http://www.museum-online.dk/kulturm_rapport/Nr_Alslev.pdf |date=2014-05-02 }}, Museum-online.dk. {{da icon}} Retrieved 16 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ricardo Enriquez Reyes, Jr.''' (born April 12, 1950), commonly known as '''Ricky Reyes''', also known as "'''Mother Ricky'''" is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[hairdresser]], [[philanthropist]] and [[businessman]]. He is the owner of Ricky Reyes chain of salons and host of television programme "Gandang Ricky Reyes".
[[File:Rickyreyesjf.JPG|thumb|Gandang Ricky Reyes salon at SM City Baliuag.]]

==Biography==
The money he earned from sweeping floors was used as capital for his first beauty parlor in 1970. Reyes now has a 44-branch network of Gandang Ricky Reyes salons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=567710&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=78 From parlor sweeper to Forbes Magazine A-lister]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Reyes’ philanthropic work began in 1984 when he initiated the “Isang Guntíng Isang Suklay” ("one scissor, one comb") programme which gave free livelihood training to the people of [[Dasmariñas, Cavite]]. “We started with giving free haircuts,” says Reyes, “but then I remembered the lesson about teaching people how to fish...” This led to the foundation of the Ricky Reyes Learning Institute (RRLI) where he makes education accessible to youth unable to afford college education. The [[vocational school]] offers a range of courses in hotel and restaurant services, as well as technical courses in [[cosmetology]] conducted by [[TESDA]]-certified professionals.

In 2010, Reyes was cited by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as one of the 48 Heroes of Philanthropy list in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2010/03/08/asia-heroes-charity-personal-finance-philanthropy-malaysia.html Asia's Heroes Of Philanthropy - Forbes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected for his work on health care and job training, particularly involving CHILD Haus (Center for Health Improvement and Life Development), a [[halfway house]]  for poor, cancer-stricken children from provinces who are seeking treatment in [[Metro Manila]] hospitals and for leading a team of volunteers in feeding about 50,000 victims of [[Typhoon Ketsana]] for two weeks.

In 2015, Renato Nocos, a former employee of Reyes' chain of salons, filed a discrimination case against his employer. Reyes fired Nocos after he found out that he is positive with [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] (HIV). The camp of Reyes denied the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/54183/ricky-reyes-corporation-denies-firing-employee-due-to-hiv|title=Ricky Reyes Corporation denies firing employee due to HIV|publisher=''Pep.ph''|language=Filipino|date=July 2, 2015|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 2016, the National Labor Relations Commission had found Reyes guilty on the said case. Reyes ordered to reinstate Nocos in his job and pay 600,000 pesos worth of back wages and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/02/08/1550948/worker-hiv-wins-labor-case-vs-salon|title=Worker with HIV wins labor case vs salon|publisher=''[[The Philippine Star]]''|date=February 8, 2016|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Seizō Sakonji'''|左近司政三| Sakonji Seizō |extra=27 June 1879 – 20 August 1969}} was an admiral in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], and cabinet minister in the wartime government of the [[Empire of Japan]].

==Background==
Sakonji was born in [[Yonezawa, Yamagata|Yonezawa]], [[Yamagata Prefecture]], where his father had been a [[samurai]] in the service of the [[Yonezawa Domain]]. However, soon after his birth, the family relocated to [[Kanazawa, Ishikawa]], and then to [[Osaka]], where Sakonji was adopted by his uncle, who was a lawyer. After attending military preparatory schools, he entered the 28th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] and graduated 8th of the 105 cadets in his class in December 1900. He served his midshipman assignment on the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Hashidate||2}}, which made  along-distance navigational training voyage to [[Manila]], [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], [[Singapore]], [[Bangkok]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Incheon]], [[Busan]] and [[Vladivostok]] in 1901. As an ensign, he was assigned to the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Iwate||2}} as chief navigator.

He served in combat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] on [[torpedo boat]]s, becoming a torpedo warfare specialist after the war. Promoted to commander in 1915, he led the training squadron on a long distance navigational training cruise to the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand in 1916.

During [[World War I]], he was sent to the [[Netherlands]] and the [[United Kingdom]] as a [[military attaché]] to observe modern western warfare firsthand. He was promoted to captain in 1919, and served on the Japanese delegation to the [[Treaty of Versailles]].

On his return to Japan, he was assigned to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]]. He later returned to sea in December 1923 as captain of the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}} and was promoted to rear admiral in 1924 and vice admiral in 1928. In 1929, he was an influential member of the Japanese delegation at the [[London Naval Treaty]] negotiations. On his return to Japan in 1930, he became commander of the Training Fleet, and personally led a training voyage in 1931, going from [[Keelung]] to Hong Kong, Singapore, [[Colombo]], [[Aden]], [[Port Said]], [[Naples]], [[Toulon]], [[Marseilles]], [[Malta]], [[Alexandria]], [[Djibouti]], Colombo, Batavia, Manila, [[Palau]] and Sasebo. In 1931, he became [[Ministry of the Navy of Japan|Vice-Minister of the Navy]].

In 1932, Sakonji became commander in chief of the [[3rd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|IJN 3rd Fleet]], and of the [[Sasebo Naval District]]. Sakonji had made a very favorable impression on the [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[Combined Fleet]] [[Suzuki Kantarō]] due to his strong negotiating position during the London Naval Treaty negotiations and subsequent support for the [[Treaty Faction]] within the Imperial Japanese Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Asada. ''From Mahan to Pearl Harbor'', page 144&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, Sakonji earned the enmity of influential [[Fleet Faction]] leader, [[Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu]], and Sakonji was effectively forced into the reserves in March 1934.

Subsequently, Sakonji served as president of the [[North Sakhalin Oil Company]] from July 1935 to July 1941.
Sakonji was selected by [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Fumimaro Konoe]] to become [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (Japan)|Minister of Commerce and Industry]] in 1941. He was also granted a seat in the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]] in the [[Diet of Japan]] from January 1943. Under Prime Minister Suzuki Kantarō in April 1945, he was again appointed to the Cabinet as a [[Minister of State]], where he worked to bring about an end to the war by urging acceptance of the [[Potsdam Declaration]].
After the [[surrender of Japan]], most members of the wartime Japanese cabinets were arrested for suspected [[war crimes]] by the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|Allied occupation authorities]]. However, Sakonji was not prosecuted due to his efforts for peace at the end of the war.

Following the [[occupation of Japan]], in 1951 Sakonji was asked to serve on the committee towards the establishment of the modern [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]].

'''Shanghaiing''' or '''crimping''' is the practice of [[kidnapping]] people to serve as [[sailor]]s by coercive techniques such as [[trickery]], [[intimidation]], or [[violence]]. Those engaged in this form of kidnapping were known as ''crimps.'' The related term ''[[Impressment|press gang]]'' refers specifically to [[impressment]] practices in Great Britain's [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name="1911eb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopædia Britannica:Crimp |year=1911 |publisher=Britannica |edition= 11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of crimps and the spread of the practice of shanghaiing resulted from a combination of laws, economic conditions, and the shortage of experienced sailors in England and on the American West Coast in the mid-19th century.

First, once an American sailor signed on board a vessel for a voyage, it was illegal for him to leave the ship before the voyage's end. The penalty was imprisonment, the result of federal legislation enacted in 1790.&lt;ref name="beatl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/maritime/MaritimeNation/TimeLines/Merchant_Marine.htm |title=American Merchant Marine Timeline, 1789–2005 |accessdate=2007-03-29 |work=Barnard's Electronic Archive and Teaching Library |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609130323/http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/maritime/MaritimeNation/TimeLines/Merchant_Marine.htm |archivedate=2007-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (This factor was mitigated by the [[Maguire Act of 1895]] and the [[White Act of 1898]], and finally abolished by the [[Seamen's Act|Seamen's Act of 1915]].)

Second, the practice was driven by a shortage of labor, particularly of skilled labor on ships on the West Coast. With crews abandoning ships en masse because of the [[California Gold Rush]], a healthy body on board the ship was a boon.&lt;ref name="poorjack"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hope |first=Ronald | title= Poor Jack: The Perilous History of the Merchant Seaman |year=2001 |publisher= Greenhill Books|location= London|isbn=1-86176-161-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sup1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sailors.org/pdf/history1-2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030512184317/http://www.sailors.org/pdf/history1-2.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-05-12 |title=The Lookout of the Labor Movement |accessdate=2007-04-02 |work=Sailors Union of the Pacific |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, shanghaiing was made possible by the existence of boarding masters, whose job was to find crews for ships. Boarding masters were paid "by the body," and thus had a strong incentive to place as many seamen on ships as possible.&lt;ref name="poorjack"/&gt; This pay was called "[[Blood money (term)|blood money]]," and was just one of the revenue streams available.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shapingsf.org/ezine/labor/shanghai/main.html|title=About That Blood in the Scuppers |accessdate=2007-04-03 |author=Georgia Smith |year=1988 |work= Reclaiming San Francisco: History Politics and Culture, a City Lights Anthology |publisher=City Lights |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061011111827/http://www.shapingsf.org/ezine/labor/shanghai/main.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors set the stage for the crimp: a boarding master who uses trickery, intimidation, or violence to put a sailor on a ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

The most straightforward method for a crimp to shanghai a sailor was to render him unconscious, forge his signature on the ship's articles, and pick up his "blood money." This approach was widely used, but there were more profitable methods.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

In some situations, the boarding master could receive the first two, three, or four months of wages of a man he shipped out.&lt;ref name="poorjack"/&gt; Sailors were able to get an advance against their pay for an upcoming voyage to allow them to purchase clothes and equipment, but the advance wasn't paid directly to the sailor because he could simply abscond with the money. Instead, those to whom money was owed could claim it directly from the ship's captain. An enterprising crimp, already dealing with a seaman, could supplement his income by supplying goods and services to the seaman at an inflated price, and collecting the debt from the sailor's captain.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

Some crimps made as much as $9,500 per year ({{inflation|US|9500|1890|r=-4|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppowerus/ |title=Purchasing Power of Money in the United States from 1774 to 2007 |accessdate=2008-04-20 |last=Officer |first=Lawrence H. |authorlink= |author2=Williamson, Samuel H. |year=2008 |work=Purchasing Power of Money in the United States from 1774 to 2007 |publisher=MeasuringWorth.Com |pages= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crimps were well positioned politically to protect their lucrative trade.&lt;ref name="pickel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatwestbooks.com/shapage.htm |author=Bill Pickelhaupt |title=Shanghaied in San Francisco |accessdate=2007-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211180046/http://www.greatwestbooks.com/shapage.htm |archivedate=2006-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The keepers of boardinghouses for sailors supplied men on election day to go from one polling place to another, "[[Vote early and vote often|voting early and often]]" for the candidate who would vote in their interest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} In San Francisco, men such as Joseph "Frenchy" Franklin and George Lewis, long-time crimps, were elected to the California state legislature, an ideal spot to assure that no legislation was passed that would have a negative impact on their business.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Some examples included [[James Kelly (crimper)|Jim "Shanghai" Kelly]] and Johnny "Shanghai Chicken" Devine of San Francisco, and [[Joseph Kelly (crimper)|Joseph "Bunco" Kelly]] of Portland.&lt;ref name="pickel"/&gt; Stories of their ruthlessness are innumerable, and some have survived into print.

Another example of romanticized stories involves the "birthday party" Shanghai Kelly threw for himself, in order to attract enough victims to man a notorious sailing ship named the ''Reefer'' and two other ships.

==Ending the practice==
[[Image:Furuseth-La Follette-Steffens-1915.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|[[Andrew Furuseth]] (left) and [[Robert M. La Follette Sr.|Senator La Follette]] (center) were the architects of the Seamen's Act of 1915.  With [[muckraker]] [[Lincoln Steffens]], circa 1915.]]Demand for manpower to keep ships sailing to [[Alaska]] and the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] kept crimping a real danger into the early 20th century, but the practice was finally ended by a series of legislative reforms that spanned almost 50 years.

Before 1865, maritime labor laws primarily enforced stricter discipline onboard ships.&lt;ref name="bauer283"&gt;Bauer, 1988:283.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after 1865, this began to change.  In 1868, New York State started cracking down on sailors' boardinghouses.  They declined in number from 169 in 1863 to 90 in 1872.&lt;ref name="bauer284"/&gt;  Then in 1871, Congress passed legislation to revoke license of officers guilty of mistreating seamen.&lt;ref name="bauer284"&gt;Bauer, 1988:284.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, Congress passed the [[Shipping Commissioners Act of 1872]] to combat crimps.&lt;ref name="bauer284"/&gt;  Under this act, a sailor had to sign on to a ship in the presence of a federal shipping commissioner.&lt;ref name="bauer284"/&gt;  The presence of a shipping commissioner was intended to ensure the sailor wasn't "forcibly or unknowingly signed on by a crimp."&lt;ref name="bauer284"/&gt;

In 1884, the [[Dingley Act (shipping)|Dingley Act]] came into effect.  This law prohibited the practice of seamen taking advances on wages.&lt;ref name="bauer285"&gt;Bauer, 1988:285.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also limited the making of seamen's allotments to only close relatives.&lt;ref name="bauer285"/&gt;  However, the crimps fought back.  In 1886, a loophole to the Dingley Act was created, allowing boardinghouse keepers to receive seamen's allotments.&lt;ref name="bauer285"/&gt;
{{Slavery}}

The widespread adoption of steampowered vessels in the world's merchant marine services in the late 19th and early 20th centuries radically altered the economics of seafaring. Without acres of canvas to be furled and unfurled, the demand for unskilled labor greatly diminished (and, by extension, crimping). The [[sinking of the RMS Titanic]], followed by onset of [[World War I]] (which made the high seas a much more dangerous place due to the threat of submarine attack) provided the final impetus to stamp out the practice. In 1915, [[Andrew Furuseth]] and Senator [[Robert M. La Follette Sr.]] pushed through the [[Seamen's Act|Seamen's Act of 1915]] that made crimping a federal crime, and finally put an end to it.

==Verb==
The verb "shanghai" joined the lexicon with "crimping" and "sailor thieves" in the 1850s, possibly because [[Shanghai]] was a common destination of the ships with abducted crews.&lt;ref name="1911eb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=shanghai |title=Shanghai |accessdate=2007-04-05 |work=dictionary.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term has since expanded to mean "kidnapped" or "induced to do something by means of fraud."&lt;ref&gt;For a modern definition of "shanghaied" see [[wikt:shanghaied]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social BI''', or '''Social Business Intelligence''', refers to the creation, publishing and sharing of custom [[business analytics]] reports and [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboard]]s by end users of ''[[Cloud computing|Cloud]]'' technologies.

Social or collaborative BI is the use of Enterprise 2.0 tools and practices with business intelligence outputs for the purpose of making collective decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forteconsultancy.wordpress.com/2014/11/12/social-bi-for-intelligent-enterprise-2-0/ |title=Social BI for Intelligent Enterprise 2.0 |accessdate= 12 November 2014 |publisher= Forte Consultancy Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; First enabled by the rapid growth of [[social media]] networks in 2009, Social BI allows for the collaborative development of post user-generated analytics among [[business analyst]]s and data mining professionals.  This has removed previous barriers to [[business intelligence|self-service BI]] while still employing traditional analytics applications.

Social BI can also be interpreted as providing business intelligence based on social networks data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.groupcharger.com/social-business-intelligence/ |title=1 Social Business Intelligence |accessdate= 28 November 2011 |publisher= GroupCharger}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a company selling consumer electronics goods needs to know how people are responding to their latest advertisements or promotions. The reports and visualizations made using social media represent what people are talking about in real time. Pulling data from different social media and preparing understandable reports will help company to decide upon further steps. These dashboards, [[Computer graphics|visualizations]], reports based on social media will be of help for companies to get efficient feedback and act accordingly.

==History==
On September 13, 2011, [[Dachis Group]] introduced the Social Business Index to provide some insights into how ‘social’ companies are, and how they stack up against similar corporations in their respective industries and their competitors, and provide some ‘social business’ benchmarks by company, subsidiary, geography, department and brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/13/dachis-group-debuts-social-business-index-think-of-it-as-klout-for-companies/ |title=2 Dachis Group Debuts ‘Social Business Index’ – Think Of It As Klout For Companies |accessdate= 28 November 2011 |author= Robin Wauters |date= 2011-09-13 |work= |publisher= Techcrunch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Space Imaging Middle East LLC''' (SIME) is a regional affiliate of [[DigitalGlobe]], the largest commercial remote sensing company in the world.

Established in 1997, SIME started off by introducing high-resolution satellite imagery to the [[Middle East]] region, operating from government-run [[ground station]]s. Today, SIME, headquartered in the [[United Arab Emirates]], is a leading [[Geographic information system|Geo-Spatial and GIS]] solutions provider throughout the Middle East, the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Eastern Africa]] and [[Central Asia]].

SIME's products and services include [[photogrammetry]], [[map]]ping, GIS, 3D models, [[imagery analysis]] and reporting software, [[vehicle tracking system|vehicle tracking]], [[Consultant|consulting]], and training, among others.  SIME engages in technology partnerships with leading technology companies, and owns and operates a wide range of sources for [[satellite]] and [[aerial imagery]].

The company's profile was raised during the 2003 [[Iraq War]], when high-resolution [[satellite imagery]] licensed from SIME was used by some news organizations to give the public "bird's eye views" of various key Iraqi locations, such as [[Fallujah]], and [[Bagdhad]].

In 2003 SIME supplied 1-meter resolution imagery of [[Afghanistan]] to the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC), as part of a survey to monitor the production of illicit crops.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spaceimagingme.com/content/Downloads/news/29-Oct-2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remote sensing technology==
SIME offers imagery collected from various [[earth observation satellite]]s and aerial sensors, with resolutions varying from 15 centimeters to 20 meters. SIME's [[satellite constellation]] includes the [[Indian Remote Sensing satellite]] (IRS), [[IKONOS]] and [[CARTOSAT]] satellites. SIME controls its satellite constellation via a ground station based in the [[UAE]]. The Company also has an aircraft permanently stationed in the region to collect aerial imagery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spaceimagingme.com/content/Sensors/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partners and subsidiaries==
SIME is the main investor of [[European Space Imaging]] in [[Munich, Germany]], which gives SIME direct access to the latest in European satellite technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euspaceimaging.com/content/About/index.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708065129/http://www.euspaceimaging.com/content/about/index.asp |archivedate=2007-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SIME has partnered with the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) to operate the ground station and to develop hosting and delivery systems of data. It has also teamed up with [[GAF AG]] of Munich to provide specialized [[remote sensing|remote-sensing]] studies. SIME has established a joint venture with [[Sanborn map|Sanborn Incorporated]] to provide aerial imaging products and advanced modeling solutions. In the [[Far East]], the Company has teamed up with [[Mappoint Asia]] to provide vehicle and asset tracking systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceimagingme.com/content/Tech%20Partners/index.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041103094050/http://spaceimagingme.com/content/tech%20partners/index.asp |archivedate=2004-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sustainability Accounting Standards Board''' was founded in 2011 to develop and disseminate [[sustainability accounting]] [[Generally accepted accounting principles|standards]]. While the [[FASB]] has for the past forty years developed the [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)|accounting principles]] currently used in [[financial reporting]] in the United States, other [[Social and environmental accounting|social and environmental measures]] are now understood to be of relevance. The SASB aims to integrate its standards into the [[Form 10-K]] which must be filed by [[public companies]] with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]; in this sense it differs from initiatives such as the [[Global Reporting Initiative|GRI]], by working within the current system of [[financial regulation]].&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/78e36030-b93f-11e1-b4d6-00144feabdc0.html#axzz22rFwi7UQ |title=US companies urged to put natural capital in accounts |author=Scott, Mike |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=24 June 2012 |accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general principle is, in [[Peter Drucker]]'s phrase, "what gets measured gets managed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ede977b0-b896-11e1-82c8-00144feabdc0.html#axzz22rFwi7UQ |title=Calls for corporate disclosure of social impact |author=Crooks, Ed |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=17 June 2012 |accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SASB appointed in 2014 former NYC Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] as Chair and former SEC Chair [[Mary Schapiro]] as Vice Chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wenzel|first1=Else|title=Finance powerhouses Michael Bloomberg and Mary Schapiro to lead SASB|url=https://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2014/05/01/sasb-taps-star-power-mike-bloomberg-and-former-sec-chair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SASB IAG Members==
Investors increasingly acknowledge that environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors can impact a company’s ability to manage risk and deliver financial performance over the long-term. As such, many investors use ESG information to develop a comprehensive view of company performance and to help evaluate a company’s long-term value. Investors can play an important role in enhancing disclosure effectiveness by expecting companies to disclose performance on material ESG factors and by participating in the development of disclosure standards. Accordingly, SASB has created an Investor Advisory Group (IAG). The IAG comprises leading asset owners and asset managers who are committed to improving the quality and comparability of sustainability-related disclosure to investors, and represent a combined total of more than $21 trillion USD assets under management (AUM).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''''The Informant!''''' is a 2009 American [[Biographical film|biographical]]-[[Comedy film|comedy]]-[[crime film]] directed by [[Steven Soderbergh]]. Written by [[Scott Z. Burns]], the film stars [[Matt Damon]] as the titular informant named [[Mark Whitacre]], as well as [[Scott Bakula]], [[Joel McHale]] and [[Melanie Lynskey]]. It depicts Whitacre's involvement as a [[whistle blower]] in the [[lysine price-fixing conspiracy]] of the mid-1990s as described in the 2000 [[nonfiction]] book ''[[The Informant (book)|The Informant]]'', by journalist [[Kurt Eichenwald]].&lt;ref name="Webber"&gt;{{cite news |last=Webber |first=Susan |title=Tale of the Tapes |work=The Daily Deal |publisher=Aurora Advisors |date=25 September 2000 |url=http://www.auroraadvisors.com/articles/2000-09_dailydeal.html |accessdate=2 October 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006125306/http://www.auroraadvisors.com/articles/2000-09_dailydeal.html |archivedate=6 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released on September 18, 2009, ''The Informant!'' received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed towards Matt Damon's performance and the film's comedic yet ironic tone, although the latter has also been a point of derision by other critics.

==Plot==
[[Mark Whitacre]], a rising star at the [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM) office in [[Decatur, Illinois]] during the early 1990s, blows the whistle on the company’s price-fixing tactics at the urging of his wife Ginger.&lt;ref name="Cain-behind"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cain |first=Tim |title=Behind the inside man: Mark Whitacre, talks about 'The Informant,' his time in prison and moving forward |work=[[Herald &amp; Review]] |date=6 April 2008 |url=http://www.herald-review.com/articles/2008/04/06/news/local/1031549.txt |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615000939/http://www.herald-review.com/articles/2008/04/06/news/local/1031549.txt |archivedate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cain-hobnobbing"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cain |first=Tim |title=Don't expect "Informant" hobnobbing |work=[[Herald &amp; Review]] |date=19 March 2008 |url=http://herald-review.com/articles/2008/03/19/columnists/cain/1030816.txt |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711235333/http://herald-review.com/articles/2008/03/19/columnists/cain/1030816.txt |archivedate=11 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One night in November 1992, Whitacre confesses to [[FBI]] special agent Brian Shepard that ADM executives&amp;mdash;including Whitacre himself&amp;mdash;had routinely met with competitors to fix the price of [[lysine]], an additive used in the commercial livestock industry. Whitacre secretly gathers hundreds of hours of video and audio over several years to present to the FBI.&lt;ref name="Cain-behind"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muirhead"&gt;{{cite news |last=Muirhead |first=Sarah |title=Whitacre paid ultimate price |work=Feedstuffs |publisher=[[Informa]] |date=2 June 2008|pages=[http://fdsmagissues.feedstuffs.com/fds/PastIssues/FDS8022/fds01_8022.pdf 1], [http://fdsmagissues.feedstuffs.com/fds/PastIssues/FDS8022/fds42_8022.pdf 42], [http://fdsmagissues.feedstuffs.com/fds/PastIssues/FDS8022/fds43_8022.pdf 43]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sidhu"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Sidhu |first=Roopam |title=Fresno company connected to Matt Damon movie |publisher=CBS TV 47 Fresno |date=23 July 2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7c-e_9thlk |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626061830/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7c-e_9thlk |archivedate=26 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He assists in gathering evidence by clandestinely taping the company’s activity in business meetings at various locations around the globe such as [[Tokyo]], [[Paris]], [[Mexico City]], and [[Hong Kong]], eventually collecting enough evidence of collaboration and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to warrant a raid of ADM.

Whitacre’s good deed dovetails with his own major infractions, while his internal, secret struggle with [[bipolar disorder]] seems to take over his exploits.&lt;ref name="Cain-behind"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{cite news |author=Editorial staff |title=What is "The Informant" about? |work=[[The Patriot Ledger]] |publisher=[[GateHouse Media]] |date=16 May 2008 |url=http://www.patriotledger.com/archive/x1902439227/Basis-of-movie |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204103051/http://www.patriotledger.com/archive/x1902439227/Basis-of-movie |archivedate=4 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the film focuses on Whitacre's meltdown resulting from the pressures of wearing a wire and organizing surveillance for the FBI for three years, instigated by Whitacre's reaction, in increasingly manic overlays, to various trivial magazine articles he reads. In a stunning turn of events immediately following the covert portion of the case, headlines around the world report Whitacre had embezzled $9 million from his own company during the same period of time he was secretly working with the FBI and taping his co-workers, while simultaneously aiming to be elected as ADM CEO following the arrest and conviction of the remaining upper management members.&lt;ref name="Cain-behind"/&gt; In the ensuing chaos, Whitacre appears to shift his trust and randomly destabilize his relationships with Special Agents Shepard and Herndon and numerous attorneys in the process.

Authorities at ADM begin investigating the forged papertrail Whitacre had built to cover his own deeds. After being confronted with evidence of his fraud, Whitacre's defensive claims begin to spiral out of control, including an accusation of [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] against Agent Shepard and the FBI, which had made a substantial move to distance their case from Whitacre entirely. Because of this major infraction and Whitacre’s bizarre behavior, he is sentenced to a prison term three times as long as that meted out to the [[white-collar crime|white-collar criminals]] he helped to catch.&lt;ref name="Cain-behind"/&gt; In the epilogue, Agent Herndon visits Whitacre in prison as he videotapes a futile appeal to seek a presidential [[pardon]]. Overweight, balding and psychologically beaten after his years long ordeal, Whitacre is eventually released from prison, with his wife Ginger waiting to greet him.

==Production==
In 2002, after completing ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'', Soderbergh announced his intent to adapt the book ''[[The Informant (book)|The Informant]]'' by Kurt Eichenwald, a former journalist for ''[[The New York Times]]''. [[Scott Z. Burns]] wrote the script based on the book.&lt;ref name="Cain-hobnobbing"/&gt;

Production began in May, 2008 in [[Decatur, Illinois]].  Filming was also done at the former Whitacre mansion in [[Moweaqua, Illinois]], a small town about 25 miles from Decatur, and at Illini Country Club in [[Springfield, Illinois]].  Some exterior shots were done in Mesa, Arizona, in November 2008. Other portions of the film were shot in the [[Coachella Valley]], California.&lt;ref name=Filming&gt;{{cite web |title=Coachella Valley Feature Film Production 1920–2011 |url=http://www.visitpalmsprings.com/page/filming-in-palm-springs/126939 |work=Filming in Palm Springs |accessdate=October 1, 2012 |author=Palm Springs Visitors Center |location=Palm Springs, CA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001025937/http://visitpalmsprings.com/page/filming-in-palm-springs/126939 |archivedate=October 1, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on September 18, 2009. Damon gained 20–30 pounds for the role in order to look more like Whitacre.

For the film Soderbergh cast a number of [[Stand-up comedy|stand up]] comedians in prominent and supporting roles, including [[Andrew Daly]], [[Joel McHale]], [[Allan Havey]], [[Tom Papa]], [[Patton Oswalt]], [[Rick Overton]], [[Paul F. Tompkins]], the [[Smothers Brothers]] and [[Bob Zany]].

==Overview==
''The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels'' outlines the benefits that the development of coal, oil, and natural gas have had on mankind, including improved health, increased lifespan, and expansion of material welfare.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite web|title=Making the Case for the Benefits of Fossil Fuels|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2014-11-17/making-the-case-for-the-benefits-of-fossil-fuels|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stossel|first1=John|title=Fossil fuels are no catastrophe.

The book also covers the topics of climate livability, the effects of [[carbon emissions]], the nature of the environmental movement, and the role fossil fuels play in everyday life.&lt;ref name=cspan&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edward Hilboldt|first1=John|title=Book Discussion on The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?322718-1/book-discussion-moral-case-fossil-fuels|publisher=CSPAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=financialpost&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=Peter|title=Peter Foster: Don’t trust the global warming doomsters and their moral outrage|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2015/01/29/peter-foster-why-you-cant-trust-the-global-warming-doomsters/|work=Financial Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein writes that alternative energy sources like wind, solar, and [[biofuel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are inferior to fossil fuels because they are more expensive and less reliable.&lt;ref name=blaze&gt;Veer, PeerGuy [http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/the-moral-case-for-fossil-fuels-a-bold-humanist-statement/ The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels: A Bold Humanist Statement] ''The Blaze''.

In 2014, Epstein was interviewed by [[Peter Thiel]] at an event hosted by the energy startup Tachyus. Thiel also provided a blurb for the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://industrialprogress.com/2014/11/25/the-moral-case-rising/ The Moral Case Rising] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209211642/http://industrialprogress.com/2014/11/25/the-moral-case-rising/ |date=2015-02-09 }} “Center for Industrial Progress”. January 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, political commentator [[John McLaughlin (host)|John McLaughlin]] called Epstein "most original thinker of the year" for his book during McLaughlin's yearly ''[[The McLaughlin Group]]'' roundup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The McLaughlin Group 12/26/14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW-gLEpyjGY&amp;feature=youtu.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Theme Hospital''''' is a [[business simulation game]] developed by [[Bullfrog Productions]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] in 1997 for the PC in which players design and operate a privately owned [[hospital]] with the goal of curing patients of fictitious comical ailments. The game is the thematic successor to ''[[Theme Park (video game)|Theme Park]]'', also produced by Bullfrog, and the second instalment in their ''Theme'' series, and part of their ''Designer Series''. The game is noted for its humour, and contains numerous references to pop culture.

[[Peter Molyneux]] and James Leach came up with the idea of creating a ''Theme'' game based on a hospital, but Molyneux was not directly involved in development due to his work on ''[[Dungeon Keeper]]''. Designers originally planned to include four distinct gameplay modes corresponding to historical time periods, but this was dropped due to time pressures on the team. Multiplayer support with up to four players was added in a patch. The game received a generally positive reception, with reviewers praising the graphics and humour in particular. ''Theme Hospital'' was a commercial success, selling over 4 million copies worldwide, and was ported to the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1998. A [[Sega Saturn]] version was in development, but cancelled. The game was re-released on [[GOG.com]] in 2012 and [[Origin (digital distribution software)|Origin]] in 2015, and the PlayStation version was released on the [[PlayStation Network]] in Europe in 2008, Japan in 2009, and North America in 2010. Revival attempts have been made with the development of [[open source video game|open-source]] remakes such as ''CorsixTH''.

== Gameplay ==

[[File:ThemeHospital.gif|thumb|left|A typical hospital.]]

The player is required to build an environment that will attract patients with comical diseases and then treat them while tending to their needs. The game has a somewhat [[black comedy|dark sense of humour]], similar to that of its predecessor, ''Theme Park''.&lt;ref name=CGWPC /&gt; Diseases include Bloaty Head (which swells the patient's head), King Complex (which forces the patient to impersonate [[Elvis Presley]]), and Alien DNA (which transforms the patient into an alien).&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;

Once a diagnosis is made, the patient will be sent for treatment.&lt;ref name="Quick PlayGuide 9 11" /&gt; While a few rooms are available at the start of the game, the rest must be researched.&lt;ref name="Manual 10"&gt;Manual, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Some rooms, such as the Inflator room—where patients with Bloaty Head are treated—contain machines which require regular maintenance by a handyman: if neglected for too long, they will explode, killing all occupants of the room.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 32,33.&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors must have acquired certain specialist skills to practise in certain rooms, such as the Research room (used to research new rooms and cures, and improve existing ones) and Operating Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 8–11.&lt;/ref&gt; There are rooms that only staff use, such as the Staff Room and the Training room, while patients also require certain rooms such as toilet facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 10,11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis and treatment cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including the amount of diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms,&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 23,24.&lt;/ref&gt; and loans can be taken out.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 24,25.&lt;/ref&gt; From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt to cover it up by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation,&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 34,35.&lt;/ref&gt; a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 35,36.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.&lt;ref name=PCZoneGuide&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=PC Zone|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issue=52|date=July 1997|title=Everything you wanted to know about Theme Hospital but were too afraid to ask...|pages=126, 127|ISSN=0967-8220|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the player has no direct control over the patients, they have some influence over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining what to do with them when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 25–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient),&lt;ref&gt;Manual, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and rearrange queues.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 25,26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The player competes against computer rivals named after famous computers, real and fictional: these include [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] from ''[[Red Dwarf (TV series)|Red Dwarf]]'' and [[Deep Thought (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Deep Thought]] from ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mark Langshaw|title=Theme Hospital retrospective: Just what the doctor ordered|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/retro-corner/feature/a623869/theme-hospital-retrospective-just-what-the-doctor-ordered/|website=Digital Spy|accessdate=6 October 2016|date=24 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006175554/http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/retro-corner/feature/a623869/theme-hospital-retrospective-just-what-the-doctor-ordered/|archive-date=6 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is timed with days of the year,&lt;ref name=PCZone /&gt; and at the end of each year (game time), players are judged on their performances, and may be given trophies, reputation increases, or cash bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, pp. 37,38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level has set goals in the fields of financial attainment, hospital reputation, patients cured, and hospital value.&lt;ref name=CGWPC /&gt; Holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die will bring about losing requirements. When the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present, or stick with their current one.&lt;ref&gt;Manual, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; If enough rats have been shot, the player is taken to a special level whose goal is to shoot as many as possible.&lt;ref name=PCZoneGuide /&gt;

A [[Patch (computing)|patch]] was released that fixed bugs and added support for Serial Cable, Modem, and [[IPX/SPX]] network gaming (with up to four players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EA's Darklight Conflict and Theme Hospital|url=http://www.gamezilla.com/reviews/previews/ea_preview.asp|website=Gamezilla|accessdate=6 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990225072027/http://www.gamezilla.com/reviews/previews/ea_preview.asp|archivedate=25 February 1999|date=24 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the Windows version, and a difficulty setting.&lt;ref name=CGWPC /&gt;&lt;ref name=NetPlay&gt;{{cite av media notes|title=Theme Hospital Netplay|year=1997|author=Bullfrog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media notes|title=Theme Hospital ReadMe.txt|year=1997|author=Bullfrog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In multiplayer, each player has a colour, which patients will wear to distinguish from those of other players. "Litter Bombs" are featured, allowing players to spread litter around other players' hospitals, while staff members can be persuaded to work for other players, and there are "Mini Missions", with instructions for players to perform. Players are also able to chat with each other during a game.&lt;ref name=NetPlay /&gt;

== Development ==
''Theme Hospital'' took over two years to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|location=Bournemouth|ISSN=1742-3155|title=Revisiting Bullfrog: 25 Years On|pages=60–67|issue=110|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea came from [[Peter Molyneux]] and journalist James Leach, who explored the possibility of other ''Theme'' games while discussing ''[[Theme Park (video game)|Theme Park]]''. Leach suggested a hospital, and Molyneux was enthusiastic about the idea. Development began when the designer [[Mark Webley]] selected ''Theme Hospital'' from a list of possible games put together by Molyneux, and Webley, along with the artist [[Gary Carr (video game developer)|Gary Carr]], visited the [[Royal Surrey County Hospital]], [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]], and [[Frimley Park Hospital]] for research and inspiration.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;&lt;ref name="BTSExtra"&gt;{{cite web|title=Theme Hospital Behind The Scenes - DVD Extras|url=https://forum.gamestm.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=17641|website=[[GamesTM]]|accessdate=6 January 2018|date=8 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106173202/https://forum.gamestm.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=17641|archive-date=6 January 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr was initially displeased at the prospect of working on ''Theme Hospital'': he had previously left Bullfrog to work for [[The Bitmap Brothers]] because he did not have faith in ''Theme Park''. He chose to return based on his belief that he would work on ''[[Dungeon Keeper]]'', which he was eager to do. Initially, ''Theme Hospital'' was to feature real diseases, but these were replaced with fictional, comedic afflictions as it was decided that the game's maladies should not be too realistic:&lt;ref name=Making /&gt; the team were faced with the dilemma of having to make the hospital fun and interesting, as Webley stated that theme parks are "colourful" compared to hospitals, and Carr believed that hospital rooms looked very similar and that it was hard to tell what each machine does.&lt;ref name=GamesN&gt;{{cite web|author1=Julian Benson|title=How the makers of Theme Hospital made hospital wards and diseases funny|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/theme-hospital/theme-hospital-peter-molyneux-making-of|website=PCGamesN|accessdate=23 July 2017|date=29 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731233711/https://www.pcgamesn.com/theme-hospital/theme-hospital-peter-molyneux-making-of|archive-date=31 July 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during a hospital visit (after witnessing an operation that they were ordered out of because they were distracting the surgeon&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt;) that they came up with the idea of using made-up illnesses and cures: Carr considered death "quite sad" and believed that illness was not a popular subject.&lt;ref name=GamesN /&gt; He stated that using made-up illnesses gave them "creative freedom", which he believed was essential.&lt;ref name=GamesN /&gt; Webley said that Carr was concerned that using real diseases might be considered distasteful.&lt;ref name=BTS&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[GamesTM]]|issue=113|date=September 2011|pages=128–131|title=Behind The Scenes Theme Hospital|ISSN=1478-5889}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carr, the team were aiming for humour rather than gore.&lt;ref name=Patients&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Bullfrog Bulletin|publisher=Bullfrog Productions|title=Trying Your Patients...|pages=8, 9|issue=2|date=1995|location=Guildford}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the initial stages of programming, Bullfrog hired James Leach, who wrote the game's text and came up with the diseases. Molyneux was not directly involved in the game's production as he was then working on ''Dungeon Keeper''.&lt;ref name=Making&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|location=Bournemouth|ISSN=1742-3155|title=The Making of Theme Hospital|pages=46–51|issue=130|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphic design was decided to be modelled from those of cartoons,&lt;ref name=Making /&gt; and a goal was to have two thousand character animations.&lt;ref name=Update&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Bullfrog Bulletin|publisher=Bullfrog Productions|issue=3|date=1996|title=Hospital Update|page=11|location=Guildford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time,&lt;ref name=Update /&gt; and the team ultimately ended up with four.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Manual, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the [[Kit-Kat]] graphics correct.&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt; He said they did not have the right colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used [[Autodesk 3ds Max|3D Studio]] to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using [[Deluxe Paint]].&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt; By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and [[cutscene]]s were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished.&lt;ref name=Update /&gt; By early 1997, all that was left was refining the difficulty levels.&lt;ref name=TH /&gt;

The game deviates from the [[National Health Service|NHS]] model; Webley and Carr decided that players should think of the hospital as a business, with profit highly important. The team, who worked in offices near the Royal Surrey County Hospital, drew some inspirations from ''Theme Park'' and borrowed a great deal of code.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt; Webley explained that this was an "obvious starting point" as he had been a programmer on ''Theme Park'', and that the systems had been rewritten by the time ''Theme Hospital'' was complete.&lt;ref name=BTSExtra /&gt; A program which facilitated animation was built upon by Webley, who dubbed it the Complex Engine. There were not many meetings, and Webley took the team to the pub weekly with a list of tasks to perform. Webley explained that the way the team worked meant that only they could perform their assigned duties otherwise they would not get done, effectively giving members ownership of their parts of the game.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt; It was during one such meeting that the team realised the game was complete.&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt; The disease called King Complex was to be called Elvis Impersonator, but Elvis's estate owned the rights. Bloaty Head was based on an allergic reaction Molyneux had, when his face became an "alarming size".&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;

According to Leach, the volume of work was small. A big problem was that the team had too many ideas, and insufficient time to implement them all. For example, other diseases were planned; one of these was Animal Magnetism, which would see patients with attached animals which would have to be cut away. Another idea that was not implemented was the possibility of four separate in-game eras: futuristic, mediaeval, Victorian, and modern.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Theme Hospital|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=14 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=February 1996|page=91|quote=To start, players choose between one of four different time periods, the Middle Ages, the Victorian Era, 1970s-1980s, and of course, the future.|ISSN=1078-9693}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was originally to have players begin in the mediaeval&lt;!-- This article uses British English, in which this is not an incorrect spelling. Please do not change on the grounds that it is incorrect. --&gt; zone, and progress to more modern ones.&lt;ref name=Patients /&gt; By May 1996, the idea of the other time periods had been deemed "prohibitive" due to the amount of graphics required.&lt;ref name=Blueprint&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[PC Zone]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|issue=38|date=May 1996|pages=33, 34|ISSN=0967-8220|title=Theme Hospital|location=London|department=Blueprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr later stated that the game did not need the other eras, and that the team was small enough to make things up as they went along.&lt;ref name=GamesN /&gt; Carr was also afraid that if they had produced a design document, Electronic Arts would have considered the omission of the other eras feature cutting.&lt;ref name=GamesN /&gt; An idea that Molyneux pushed Webley's team to implement was a screen that enabled players to mix coloured chemicals to apply them to diseases. Accessibility was also a concern for the team: with so many options, it was felt that players could treat the game like work. The tester Jon Rennie simplified the game from the original design; Webley was keen for players to be able to begin play without a long tutorial.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;

''Theme Hospital'' was released in March 1997 (although it was previously due for release in November 1996&lt;ref name=EdgePrev&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Edge|publisher=[[Future plc]]|issue=36|date=September 1996|page=36|ISSN=1350-1593|title=Theme Hospital|department=Prescreen|location=Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;&lt;ref name=TH&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Bullfrog Bulletin|publisher=Bullfrog Productions|issue=4|date=1997|title=Theme Hospital|pages=4–6|location=Guildford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of Bullfrog's ''Designer Series''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Theme Hospital|developer=Bullfrog|publisher=Electronic Arts|date=1997|platform=PC|scene=Intro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EdgeBullfrog95&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Edge|publisher=[[Future plc]]|issue=22|date=July 1995|pages=25–27|ISSN=1350-1593|title=Bullfrog|location=Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game attracted some controversy from NHS managers, the [[Houses of Parliament]], and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', who published an article criticising the game as "sick" and said that the [[British Medical Association]] was using it to train management staff.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt; The NHS argued that the game mocked hospital management. Webley was invited to appear on a local radio station; he did not consider the game to make light of real-world health management because it featured fictional diseases rather than real ones. ''Theme Hospital'' was a commercial success, which surprised Bullfrog and Electronic Arts. It repeatedly appeared in the top five of budget charts and sold over 4 million copies. In 2014, Molyneux stated that he wanted the game to make a comeback, and described ''Theme Hospital'' as "a great game that I and many people remember".&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;

Original releases' cover art used a green cross on a white background, which Bullfrog did not have the right to use.&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt; The artwork was mistakenly approved because it was faxed in black and white, and had to be recalled.&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt; Later releases changed the cross to a star.&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt; Despite its rejection, the cross version is available in more recent formats.&lt;ref name=BTS /&gt;

=== Sound ===

The music and sound effects were produced by [[Russell Shaw (composer)|Russell Shaw]] and Adrian Moore.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Moore used [[Sound Forge]] to develop the sound effects.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt; Some (such as the snooker balls) were taken directly from its library, and others (including the treatment machines) were created by mixing sounds together.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt; Some machine sounds were created by mixing the sounds of electric egg mixer with that of a hydraulic lifter.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt; The farting sounds were recorded when Moore was working with bands including [[T'Pau (band)|T'Pau]], [[Prefab Sprout]], and [[Seal (band)|Seal]] at a recording studio: he did so as a joke, but they were useful for ''Theme Hospital''.&lt;ref name=Making /&gt;

=== Ports and re-releases ===

''Theme Hospital'' received positive reviews. Critics noted the strong gameplay, detailed graphics, satisfying comedic tone, and voice acting performance, but fell conflicted on music, repetition, the artificial intelligence, and the user interface.

The British magazine ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'s}} Steve Owen praised the game's challenge and "cute" graphics, but criticised the interface.&lt;ref name=PCGamer /&gt; Frederick Claude of ''Coming Soon Magazine'' also complimented the graphics as "highly detailed", and the "very simple" user interface, although he criticised the repetitiveness and lack of multiplayer support that would later be introduced with a patch.&lt;ref name=CSoon /&gt; [[GameSpot]]{{'s}} Trent Ward agreed about the graphics too, lauding them as "fantastic", and also complimented the "realistic" voice acting performance, and the humour, although he criticised the [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] as "flawed". His conclusion was that the game "just doesn't fly".&lt;ref name=GSpotPC /&gt; Bonnie James of [[EP Daily|The Electric Playground]] also liked the graphics, as well as the "lovely" opening sequence, but found the music "horrible".&lt;ref name=EP /&gt; ''[[Computer and Video Games]]''{{'s}} Alex Huhtala concurred about the graphics, describing them as "large and colourful", but commented that the humour wears off after a while, although he felt it is good to begin with.&lt;ref name=CVG /&gt;

Another reviewer who liked the graphics was Dawn Jepsen of ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'', who also praised the humour, especially the "wackiness" of the illnesses, and described the game as "delightful and absorbing".&lt;ref name=CGWPC /&gt; The humour was also approved by a reviewer of [[Jeuxvideo.com]], who, like other reviewers, lauded the graphics, by describing them as colourful.&lt;ref name=Jeuxvideo /&gt; ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]''{{'s}} reviewer echoed others' views about the humour, describing it as something they had come to except from Bullfrog, but criticised the lack of multiplayer support.&lt;ref name=NGRev /&gt; The humour was again praised by a reviewer of ''PC Power'', who said that the ailments enabled Bullfrog to have "hilarious" cures. The "thoroughly engrossing" gameplay, and the graphics were also complimented: it was stated that the bright colours gave hospitals a "cheerful look". ''Theme Hospital'' was described as a "fantastic title".&lt;ref name=PCPRev /&gt; Other comments from critics included ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]''{{'s}} reviewer's compliments of the balance of patients and illnesses against the player's resources, and his belief that the game is a refinement of its genre,&lt;ref name=Edge /&gt; and ''[[PC Zone]]''{{'s}} reviewers commendation of the detail: it was remarked that it gets players "helplessly immersed", and the game was awarded the ''PC Zone'' Classic accolade.&lt;ref name=PCZoneRev /&gt; Éric Ernaux of ''[[:fr:Gen4|Génération 4]]'' said the quality is "remarkable for a game of its genre".&lt;ref name=G4Rev /&gt;

The PlayStation version's main problem, as noted by critics, was the controls. It was cited by reviewers from GameSpot,&lt;ref name=GSpotPS /&gt; [[IGN]],&lt;ref name=IGNPS /&gt; Eurogamer,&lt;ref name=Eurogamer /&gt; and ''Edge'' as a major downside.&lt;ref name=EdgePS /&gt; Its reception was not entirely negative: James Mielke of GameSpot also commended the addictiveness, and described the port as "almost completely intact".&lt;ref name=GSpotPS /&gt; IGN agreed with others about the humour, by praising it as "wonderfully sick". It was further commented that the game's "brilliance" made it a "must-have".&lt;ref name=IGNPS /&gt; The sentiments about the controls and humour were echoed by Dan Whitehead of [[Eurogamer]], who reviewed it on the PlayStation Network.&lt;ref name=Eurogamer /&gt; Absolute PlayStation's reviewers had a mixed view about the graphics: they criticised the resolution and colour palette, but complimented the sprites. The user interface was criticised as being reminiscent of a [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit game]]. Despite the criticisms, they agreed with others about the humour, and described the game as "a blast to play".&lt;ref name=Absolute /&gt;

In 1997, ''Theme Hospital'' appeared alongside ''Theme Park'' at #61 on ''PC Gamer''{{'}}s list of top 100 games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The PC Gamer Top 100|issue=45|magazine=[[PC Gamer]]|date=July 1997|publisher=[[Future plc]]|issn=1470-1693|page=61|location=Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named in April as a Game of Distinction.&lt;ref name=PCGamer /&gt;

'''Col. Thomas Lee''' ([[circa|c.]] 1690&amp;ndash;November 14, 1750) was a leading political figure of colonial [[Virginia]]. He was a member of the [[Lee family]], a [[political dynasty]] which included many figures from the pre-[[American Revolutionary War]] era until the late 20th century. Lee became involved in politics in 1710 and he became the resident manager of the [[Northern Neck]] Proprietary for Lady Catherine Fairfax. After his father died, he inherited land in [[Northumberland County, Virginia|Northumberland]] and [[Charles County, Maryland|Charles County]]. Lee later acquired vast holdings in what are now [[Arlington County|Arlington]], [[Fairfax County|Fairfax]], [[Fauquier County|Fauquier]], [[Prince William County|Prince William]], and [[Loudoun County|Loudoun]] Counties. These properties were developed as tobacco plantations.

When Lee married Hannah Harrison Ludwell in 1722, he benefited by the connections of the already established [[Harrison family]]. A year later he would become a member of the [[House of Burgesses]]. After Lee's home was burnt down by criminals, he lost almost all of his possessions and a fair sum of money. With donations  received from [[Caroline of Ansbach]] and English Commissioners, he built his new home on the [[Potomac River]], naming it [[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall]]. Four years later in 1733, he was appointed to the [[Governor's Council]], upper house of the General Assembly. In 1747, he founded the [[Ohio Company|Ohio Company of Virginia]] with fellow Virginian colonists who wished to expand Virginia's territory into the [[Ohio River Valley]]. For a period of less than a year, in 1749, he became the ''[[de facto]]'' [[Governor of Virginia]] in place of the absent [[Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet|William Gooch]]. Lee was favored for an appointment as governor by [[George II of England|George II]] but the colonist died in 1750.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Thomas Lee was born around 1690 at [[Mount Pleasant (Hague, Virginia)|Mount Pleasant]], on the [[Machodoc River]] in [[Westmoreland County, Virginia]].  His parents were [[Richard Lee II|Col. Richard Lee II]], "the scholar", and Laetitia Corbin. His ancestors had immigrated from [[Coton, Shropshire]], England to Virginia in 1642.&lt;ref name="refuk"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/history/2003/02/lee_house.shtml  | title = Shropshire: House with its roots in history | work = | publisher = BBC | accessdate = 2009-07-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070312042814/http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/history/2003/02/lee_house.shtml |archivedate = 2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Stratford Hall and the Lees Connected with its History (1912) p.28&lt;/ref&gt; As the fourth son of the couple, Lee would not receive as large an inheritance as his older brothers. This did not prevent him from becoming successful in politics.

Lee attended college at [[The College of William and Mary]] around 1700.&lt;ref&gt;''A Catalogue of the College of William and Mary in Virginia From its Foundation to the Present Time'' (Williamsburg, 1859)&lt;/ref&gt; Lee's education was referred to as a "common Virginia education".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Stratford Hall and the Lees Connected with its History (1912) p.47&lt;/ref&gt; He soon became interested in the working of the tobacco industry. He left home to work with his uncle Thomas Corbin in the tobacco business.

==Political career==
[[File:Coat of Arms of the Lee Family.svg|175px|thumb|left|Coat of Arms of Thomas Lee]]
Lee's political career began in 1710 when he was appointed as Naval Officer of the Potomac River. The position was previously held by his father and upon his resignation, Lee was appointed as the new Naval Officer. In 1711, Lee's uncle Thomas Corbin helped him gain the position of Virginia agent for the Northern Neck Proprietary.  As a result, he was appointed by Catherine (Culpeper) Fairfax, Lady Fairfax, who was living in England, as her agent and resident manager for the Northern Neck Proprietary, which she had inherited from her father, Governor [[Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper]].  Catherine was the wife of [[Thomas Fairfax, 5th Baron Fairfax]]. This property, which consisted of approximately six million acres (24,000&amp;nbsp;km²), included all the land between the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and [[Rappahannock River|Rappahnnock]] rivers.

At one time [[Edmund Jenings]], another Lee uncle, headed this Proprietary. While Jenings was in England, the offices of the agency were located at the plantation at Machodoc and under Lee's supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fairfax Harrison]], ''Virginia Land Grants: A Study of Conveyancing in Relation to Colonial Politics'' (1925; reprinted, New York, 1979), pp.98-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to Jening's poor management,&lt;ref name="Calhoun"&gt;Calhoun. Thomas Lee of Stratford, 1690-1750: Founder of a Virginia Dynasty (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; the agency was given to Governor [[Robert Carter I|Robert "King" Carter]] in 1720. This event led to animosity between the competitive Lee and Carter families.&lt;ref&gt;Dowdey, Clifford. ''The Virginia Dynasties: The Emergence of 'King' Carter and the Golden Age'' (1969) p.354&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the families refused to marry each other until [[Henry Lee III|Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee]] married Anne Hill Carter. Henry and Anne's most notable child was [[Robert E. Lee]].

Thomas held this position until 1722.  In 1713, Thomas succeeded his father as Naval Officer in charge of collecting customs for the south side of the Potomac.&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt;

In 1714, upon his father's death, Lee inherited lands in [[Northumberland County, Virginia|Northumberland County]] near Dividing Creek, as well as land in Maryland adjoining his brother [[Philip Lee, Sr.]] of "[[Blenheim (Maryland)|Blenheim]]". Thomas leased the estate "Machodoc" from his brother [[Richard Lee III]] who was in London. That same year Thomas visited England, remaining for about a year.

Lee thought that marriage was not only important between two individuals but for their families. A nephew of his later said, "Our Late Hon[ora]ble &amp; worthy Unkle Presid[ent] Lee said that the first fall &amp; ruin of families and estates was mostly Occasioned by Imprudent Matches to Imbeggar families and estates &amp; to beget a race of beggars."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Lee to Richard Lee, 22 Feb. 1758, Box 1, ''Custis-Lee Papers,'' Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; He was engaged to Jenny Wilson in 1716. That year he returned to England to formalize the lease to the plantation before he &lt;!--What plantation is this? References are confusing--&gt;married. Before his return, Jenny Wilson had found another husband, [[James Roscoe]]. Lee learned this from [[William Byrd II|William Byrd]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt;

Lee and his brother [[Henry Lee I|Henry]] negotiated a lease for 99 years on the plantation. During his stay in England, Lee had decided to buy some property on the [[Potomac River]] called the "Clifts Plantation" in Westmoreland County.  At the time, the property was owned by Nathaniel Pope, Jr., a mariner, of London. Lee believed that when Virginia gained its independence, the capital would be located on the Potomac River.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Behind the Scenes in Washington: Being a Complete and Graphic Account of the Credit Mobilier Investigation'' (1873) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  He later renamed it as [[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford]].  Thomas purchased his father's old estate "Machodoc", from his sister-in-law, Martha Silk, the former wife of his older brother, Richard Lee III. "Machodoc" was later known as "Mount Pleasant".

===Marriage and family===

In May 1722, Thomas Lee married Hannah Harrison Ludwell (December 5, 1701 – January 25, 1750), a member of the prominent [[Harrison family]], at "Greenspring", James City County, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagel|first=Paul C.|authorlink=Paul C.

1728 was a tragic year for Lee and his family. On January 29, thieves broke into the house stealing the Lee family plate, jewelry, and other articles of value, and upon leaving, set fire to the plantation house at Machodoc. The fire destroyed the entire plantation, including Thomas' office, the barns, and outhouses. Almost all of the Lees' possessions were destroyed, as well as up to 10,000 pounds in cash (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|10000|1728}}}} today).&lt;ref&gt;''Maryland Gazette,'' 25 March - 1 April 1729&lt;/ref&gt; The house quickly burned and Hannah Lee, being pregnant with her fourth child, had to be thrown from her chamber window on the second floor. This resulted in Hannah's miscarriage of a son (they named him John). also injured in the fire was a slave girl, who died.&lt;ref&gt;The Lees of Virginia p.41&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia Governor [[Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet|William Gooch]] blamed transported convicts for the crime.  It is said that Col. Lee's loss was not less than 50,000 pounds (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50000|1728}}}} today). English Commissioners later gave Lee 300 pounds (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|300|1728}}}} today) as compensation and [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]] also gave him money from her private purse to help with rebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton and Hamilton, ''The Life of Robert E. Lee for Boys and Girls'' (1917), p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Stratford Hall and the Lees Connected with its History (1912) pp.48,59&lt;/ref&gt; The convicts and an accomplice were later found guilty. Their punishment is unknown because the trial records were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt; When construction began on the new Lee mansion, the family stayed with Thomas's brother Henry at [[Lee Hall, Virginia|Lee Hall]]. Lee sold the "Machodoc" estate to Richard Lee III's son, George Lee, who built "Mount Pleasant".

Lee's political career required trips to [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], causing him to be away from his family for extended periods of time. Lee managed to make the 80-mile (130-km) journey to his family and to be with his wife at the births of each of their children.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Seat of Empire: The Political Role of Eighteenth-Century Williamsburg'' (Williamsburg, 1950), p. 18; Westmoreland County Court Orders, 1731-1739, Part 1, p.46A, Westmoreland County Courthouse.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the sons became high-ranking political figures and were active in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and post-Revolution politics.  Richard Henry was a senator from Virginia to the [[United States Senate]] and Francis Lightfoot was in the Virginia Senate. Lee's youngest sons [[William Lee (diplomat)|William Lee]] and [[Arthur Lee (diplomat)|Arthur Lee]] served as diplomats to various European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Stratford Hall and the Lees Connected with its History'' (1912) p.110&lt;/ref&gt;  William, along with [[Jan de Neufville]], drafted an unofficial treaty between the United States and [[the Netherlands]] which [[Great Britain]] used as a reason for the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leearchive.info/wl/index.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070929184030/http://www.leearchive.info/wl/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-29 |title=William Lee|publisher=Lee Family Digital Archive|accessdate=2007-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee later became a vestryman for Copole Parish and [[Justice of the Peace]] in Westmoreland County.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, Jeanne A., "Thomas Lee 1690-1750: A Preliminary Report," (prepared for the Robert E. Lee Memorial Association, 1988), pp. 10-14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1723, Lee became a member of the House of Burgesses. He held this office until he was appointed to the [[House of Burgesses#Governor's Council|Governor's Council]] in the [[Virginia General Assembly]] in 1733. This position was a lifetime appointment. The Council was made up of twelve appointees who were selected by the Governor of Virginia and was the upper half of the Virginia General Assembly. The lower half was made up of the [[House of Burgesses]]. This position also gave Lee the rank of Colonel, a military rank that was second only to the governor.&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt; Members of the Council were advisers to the governor and judges in the General Court of the colony. Their work led them to spend about a third of the year in the capital Williamsburg.&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt;

When Governor William Gooch was recalled to England in 1749, Lee was named President of the King's Council of Virginia and Commander-in-Chief of the colony. Nominated for appointment as Governor of Virginia by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], he died before it took place.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, ''Executive Journals,'' V, pp.299-300. 53.Lee, Lee of Virginia pp. 121-123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, ''Stratford Hall and the Lees Connected with its History'' (1912) p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ohio Company===
Lee was appointed commissioner, along with [[William Beverley]], to negotiate with the [[Six Nations of the Iroquois]] at the [[Treaty of Lancaster]] in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, ''Executive Journals''V, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; At the treaty, an agreement was made with the Six Nations for 400 pounds (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|400|1744}}}} today) in return for the right for Virginians to travel through and settle in the [[Shenandoah Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earlytreaties.unl.edu/treaty.00003.html |title=Ratified treaty # 3 A Treaty Held at the Town of Lancaster, By the Honourable the Lieutenant Governor of the Province, and the Honourable the Commissioners for the Province of Virginia and Maryland, with the Indians of the Six Nations in June, 1744. Van Doren, C. and Boyd, J. P. (Eds.). (1938). ''Indian Treaties Printed by Benjamin Franklin, 1736–1762.'' Philadelphia, PA: The Historical Society of Pennsylvania, 41–79 |publisher=University of Nebraska at Lincoln |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1747, Lee co-founded the [[Ohio Company|Ohio Company of Virginia]] along with [[Lawrence Washington (1718-1752)|Lawrence Washington]], [[Augustine Washington, Jr.]], the [[John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]], and John Hanbury. The Ohio Company was a land speculation venture which helped colonize the [[Ohio Country]]. Lee's influence as a member of the Governor's Council helped lead to the success of the Ohio Company and within seven years the company had 100 families living in Ohio.  He was also the first president of the Company and after Lee died, was succeeded by Lawrence Washington.

===Stratford Hall===
{{main|Stratford Hall (plantation)|}}
[[File:Stratford hall habs 1.jpg|225px|thumb|right| Stratford Hall Plantation, built by Thomas Lee.]]
With Lee's higher rank in society and wealth, he decided he needed to build a mansion to secure his position as one of the Virginia gentry.&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt; he chose the "Clifts," which he had owned since the mid-1710s. Lee decided on this site because it was located in Westmoreland County, where he was born, and because it was located on the Potomac River. The land was sufficient for having many construction laborers live there. Hannah had an influential say in the design and planning of the interior of the house. Philip, the couple's eldest son, had said, "See what it is to be ruled by a woman. I should have been now living in a house like this ... had not my father been persuaded by his wife to put up this very inferior dwelling, now over my head."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Carter Lee Papers, Box 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact construction date of the house is unknown but it is estimated that construction began around 1725-30, as all of Lee's sons were born at Stratford. Workers on the plantation were from all the working class: free people and [[indentured servants]] mostly from the British Isles, and African slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Jack and Marion Kaniinkow, eds., ''A List of Emigrants to America 1718-1759'' (Baltimore, 1964), p. 163; Calhoun, "Thomas Lee," p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1719 and 1746, Lee acquired vast holdings in what are now [[Arlington County|Arlington]], [[Fairfax County|Fairfax]], [[Fauquier County|Fauquier]], [[Prince William County|Prince William]], and [[Loudoun County|Loudoun]] counties. The town of [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]], was named in his honor as recommended by his two sons, who were the founders and trustees.

Hannah Harrison died at "Stratford" on January 25, 1749, having borne eleven children.&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt;  She was buried in the old family burying ground, called the "Burnt House Fields", at "Mount Pleasant".  Her tombstone was later removed to "[[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall]]", probably by Henry Lee, who built the new vault at that place. On November 14, 1750, Thomas Lee died at age sixty and was buried in the old "Burnt House Fields" at Mount Pleasant. According to his will, he wished to be buried in between his wife and his mother.&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt; He bequeathed Stratford Hall to his eldest son, Philip Ludwell Lee, and the Machodoc plantation to his nephew, [[George Lee (colonist)|George Lee]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt;
