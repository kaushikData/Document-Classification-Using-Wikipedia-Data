[[File:2007 Arctic Sea Ice.jpg|thumb|350px|Arctic sea ice coverage as of 2007 compared to 2005 and also compared to 1979-2000 average]]

Temperatures in the [[Arctic]] region have tended to increase more rapidly than the global average.  Projections of [[sea ice]] loss that are adjusted to take account of recent rapid [[Arctic shrinkage]] suggest that the Arctic will likely be free of summer sea ice sometime between 2059 and 2078.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Boé | first=Julien | last2=Hall | first2=Alex | last3=Qu | first3=Xin | title=September sea-ice cover in the Arctic Ocean projected to vanish by 2100 | journal=Nature Geoscience | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=2 | issue=5 | date=2009-03-15 | issn=1752-0894 | doi=10.1038/ngeo467 | pages=341–343|bibcode = 2009NatGe...2..341B|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[climate engineering]] schemes have been suggested to reduce the chance of significant and irreversible effects such as [[Arctic methane release]].

Several climate engineering proposals have been made which are specific to the Arctic.  They are usually [[hydrology|hydrological]] in nature, and principally centre upon measures to prevent [[Arctic shrinkage|Arctic ice loss]].

In addition, other [[solar radiation management]] climate engineering techniques, such as [[stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)|stratospheric sulfate aerosols]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crutzen | first=Paul J. | title=Albedo Enhancement by Stratospheric Sulfur Injections: A Contribution to Resolve a Policy Dilemma? | journal=Climatic Change | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=77 | issue=3-4 | date=2006-07-25 | issn=0165-0009 | doi=10.1007/s10584-006-9101-y | pages=211–220|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t1vn75m458373h63/fulltext.pdf|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been proposed.  These would cool the Arctic by adjusting the [[albedo]] of the atmosphere.

==Background==

The Arctic region plays an important role in the regulation of the Earth's climate.  Conditions in the Arctic may suggest the existence of [[tipping point (climatology)|tipping points]], including [[ice-albedo feedback]] from melting Arctic [[sea ice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Winton | first=Michael | title=Does the Arctic sea ice have a tipping point? | journal=Geophysical Research Letters | publisher=American Geophysical Union (AGU) | volume=33 | issue=23 | date=2006-12-13 | issn=0094-8276 | doi=10.1029/2006gl028017 | page=L23504| bibcode=2006GeoRL..3323504W|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arctic methane release]] from thawing [[permafrost]] and [[methane clathrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Archer | first=D. | last2=Buffett | first2=B. | last3=Brovkin | first3=V. | title=Ocean methane hydrates as a slow tipping point in the global carbon cycle | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=106 | issue=49 | date=2008-11-18 | issn=0027-8424 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0800885105 | pages=20596–20601| bibcode = 2009PNAS..10620596A| pmid = 19017807| pmc = 2584575|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The speed of future retreat of the Arctic sea ice is contentious. The [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] of 2007 states that "in some projections, Arctic late-summer sea ice disappears almost entirely by the latter part of the 21st century."  However, the ice has since undergone unexpectedly significant retreat, reaching a record low area in summer 2007 before recovering somewhat in 2008.

A tipping point process could potentially commence as the Arctic region warms, if there is [[positive feedback]] with sufficient gain.  Tim Lenton suggests that the retreat of [[sea ice]] is such a process, and the tipping may have started already.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lenton | first=T. M. | last2=Held | first2=H. | last3=Kriegler | first3=E. | last4=Hall | first4=J. W. | last5=Lucht | first5=W. | last6=Rahmstorf | first6=S. | last7=Schellnhuber | first7=H. J. | title=Tipping elements in the Earth's climate system | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=105 | issue=6 | date=2008-02-07 | issn=0027-8424 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0705414105 | pages=1786–1793| pmid =  18258748| pmc = 2538841|bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.1786L|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Climate engineering has been proposed for preventing or reversing tipping point events in the Arctic, in particular to halt the retreat of the sea ice.

Preventing such ice loss is important for climate control, as the Arctic ice regulates global temperatures by virtue of its [[albedo]], and also by restraining [[methane emissions]] from permafrost near the shoreline in the Arctic region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2009}}  Additionally, the sea ice has a wider regional climatic role, and acts to maintain permafrost more generally in the region, by insulating the cold winter winds from the warm sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=ACIA|title=Arctic Climate Impact Assessment - Scientific Report|url=https://www.amap.no/documents/doc/arctic-arctic-climate-impact-assessment/796|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86509-8|pages=216–217}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building thicker sea ice==

It has been proposed to actively enhance the polar ice cap by spraying or pumping water onto the top of it which would build thicker sea ice.&lt;ref name="Watts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=Robert G.|title=Engineering Response to Global Climate Change: Planning a Research and Development Agenda|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nArq-K7ZiacC&amp;pg=PA419|year=1997|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-56670-234-8|page=419|chapter=Cryospheric processes}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  As ice is an insulator, water on the surface of the ice tends to freeze more quickly than that below.

Thickening ice by spraying seawater onto existing ice has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.popsci.com/node/9444 |title=Duct Tape Methods to Save the Earth: Re-Ice the Arctic |magazine=Popular Science |accessdate=4 March 2009 |date= June 29, 2007 |author=Rena Marie Pacella|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Arizona State University |url=https://asunow.asu.edu/20161222-solutions-asu-scientists-propose-restoring-arctic-ice-10-million-windmills |title=ASU team proposes restoring Arctic ice with 10 million windmills |date=December 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea ice is an effective [[thermal insulator]], and thus freezing takes place much more rapidly on the top surface of the ice sheet than on the bottom.  Thicker sea ice is more structurally stable, and is more resistant to melting due to its increased mass.  An additional benefit of this method is that the increased salt content of the melting ice will tend to strengthen downwelling currents when the ice re-melts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/pt637l16gt5r7023/?p=ca10f32f85f248af9024dd6238772907&amp;pi=2 |journal=Climatic Change |volume=71 |issue=1–2 |doi=10.1007/s10584-005-5933-0 |pages=203–220 |year=2005 |title=Geoengineering Downwelling Ocean Currents: A Cost Assessment |author1=S. Zhou |author2=P. C. Flynn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ice in the sea is frozen seawater. Other ice comes from glaciers, which come from compacted snow, and is thus fresh water ice. 

If salt water ice is made on top of fresh water ice, if it melts, it may rapidly perforate the lower layers of the ice sheet.{{Full citation needed|date=July 2018}} (Salt water melts at a lower temperature than fresh water does.) Some have speculated that river water could be used to thicken fresh water ice if this problem is deemed important.

==Stratospheric sulfate aerosols==

[[Ken Caldeira|Caldeira]] and [[Lowell Wood|Wood]] analysed the effect of climate engineering in the Arctic using [[Stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)|stratospheric sulfate aerosols]].&lt;ref name=Caldeira&gt;{{cite journal | last=Caldeira | first=K. | last2=Wood | first2=L. | title=Global and Arctic climate engineering: numerical model studies | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | publisher=The Royal Society | volume=366 | issue=1882 | date=2008-11-13 | issn=1364-503X | doi=10.1098/rsta.2008.0132 | pages=4039–4056|bibcode=2008RSPTA.366.4039C|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/366/1882/4039?sid=32090301-8f67-4eae-81f5-4a76a8a6272d|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique is not specific to the Arctic region. He found that ''At high latitudes, there is less sunlight deflected per unit albedo change but climate system feedbacks operate more powerfully there. These two effects largely cancel each other, making the global mean temperature response per unit top-of-atmosphere albedo change relatively insensitive to latitude.''&lt;ref name=Caldeira/&gt;

==Influencing ocean temperature and salinity==

It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schuttenhelm |first=Rolf |title=Diomede Crossroads - Saving the North Pole? Thoughts on plausibility |url=http://www.cleverclimate.org/climate/12/diomede_crossroads/ |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725180118/http://www.cleverclimate.org/climate/12/diomede_crossroads/ |archivedate=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that locally influencing salinity and temperature of the Arctic Ocean, by changing the ratio of Pacific and fluvial waters entering through the [[Bering Strait]] could play a key role in preserving Arctic sea ice. The purpose would be to create a relative increase of fresh water inflow from the [[Yukon River]], while blocking (part) of the warm and saltier waters from the Pacific Ocean. Proposed geoengineering options include a dam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Could a Massive Dam Between Alaska and Russia Save the Arctic? | publisher=Huffington Post | date=27 November 2010 | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alaskadispatchcom/could-a-massive-dam-betwe_b_788761.html | accessdate=2011-03-10 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting [[St. Lawrence Island]] and a threshold under the narrow part of the strait.

Living in a zoo in [[Kazakhstan]] in the [[Soviet Union]], Batyr was reported as having a vocabulary of more than 20 phrases.&lt;ref name="fortune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/emachines/e11/86/fortean1.html |title=Conversing cows and eloquent elephants |last=Sieveking |first=Paul |work=fortunecity.com |publisher= |accessdate=4 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015054431/http://www.fortunecity.com/emachines/e11/86/fortean1.html |archivedate=October 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A recording of Batyr saying "Batyr is good", his name and using words such as "drink" and "give" was played on Kazakh state radio and on the First Programme of the [[Soviet Central Television|Central Television]] of the [[USSR]] — [[Vremya]], in 1980.&lt;ref name="Videoarhive"/&gt;

Like all cases of [[talking animals]], these claims are subject to the [[observer-expectancy effect]].

==Biography==
Born on July 23, 1970, at [[Almaty Zoo]], Batyr lived his entire life in the [[Karaganda Zoo]] at [[Karaganda]] in [[Kazakhstan]]. He died in 1993 having never seen nor heard another elephant. Batyr was the offspring of once-[[wildness|wild]] [[Indian elephant]]s (a subspecies of the [[Asian elephant]]) and was the second child of his mother "Palm" (1959-1998) and father "Dubas" (1959-1978)&lt;ref name="elephantse"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been presented to Kazakhstan's [[Almaty Zoo]] by the Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. The first baby elephant (elder Batyr's brother) was killed by his mom immediately after birth − at May 15, 1968.

==Abilities==
[[batır|Batyr]], whose name is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word meaning ''Dashing Equestrian'', ''Man of Courage'' or ''Athlete'', was first alleged to speak just before New Year's Day in the winter of 1977 when he was eight years old.  Zoo employees were the first to notice his "speech", but he soon delighted zoo-goers at large by appearing to ask his attendants for water and regularly praising or (infrequently) chastising himself.  By 1979, his fame as the "Speaking Elephant" had spread in the wake of various [[mass-media]] stories about his abilities, many containing considerable fabrication and wild conjecture. Batyr's case was also included in several books on animal behaviour, and in the proceedings of several scientific conferences.  These developments drew a spate of zoo visitors, and brought the offer of an exchange&amp;mdash;Batyr for a rare [[bonobo]]&amp;mdash;from the [[Czechoslovak]] [[Circus]]; an offer rejected by the zoo's employees.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who studied Batyr's abilities and wrote many publications about him, said of the elephant:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Batyr, on the level of natural blares, [Batyr] said words (including human slang) by manipulating his trunk. By putting the trunk in his mouth, pressing a tip of the trunk to the bottom of the jaw and manipulating the tongue, [the elephant] said words. Besides, being in a corner of the cage (frequently at night) with the trunk softly hanging down, the elephant said words almost silently—a sound comparable with the sound of ultrasonic devices used against mosquitoes or the peep of mosquitoes, which human hearing hears well until approximately the age of 40. While pronouncing words, only the tip of the elephant's trunk is clamped inside [the mouth] and Batyr made subtle movements with a finger-shaped shoot on the trunk tip".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Various audiovisual recordings were made during Pogrebnoj-Aleksandroff's studies of Batyr and some of these have been transferred to [[Russia]]'s [[Moscow State University]] for further study.

==Death==
Batyr died in 1993 when zookeepers accidentally gave him an overdose of sedatives.&lt;ref&gt;"The Scene in the Nation and the World", ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', September 3, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Talking elephant silenced forever", ''Washington Times'', September 3, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; His death was reported worldwide.

==Lexicon ==
It is claimed that Batyr had a vocabulary of about 20 words in the Russian and Kazakh languages. He reportedly imitated the sounds of other animals, and uttered short phrases including words of human slang. Batyr's lexicon list was compiled from audiovisual records, scientific researches and statistical data from eyewitnesses who heard the elephant themselves. Individual and disputable sounds were not considered. All other words as reported by the media were treated as fiction, second-hand and interpretations of retellings. For example, the phrase heard from Batyr as "water" was reported as "the elephant asked to drink".{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

'''Full list of words and phrases reported to have been spoken by Batyr:'''&lt;br&gt;
Using trunk in mouth—
* '''"Баты́р"''' — Batyr — said abruptly;

* '''"Батыр плохой"''' — Bad Batyr — rarely;
* '''"Иди́"''' — Go;

* A gnashing sound imitative of [[rubber]] or polyfoam (foam plastic) on glass;
* The peep of rats or mice;
* The bark of dogs;
* The natural blares of elephants.

== From the press ==
Reporter Richard Beeston in Moscow wrote the article "Soviet Zoo Has Talking Elephant"— 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Batyr, a 10-year-old Indian elephant at the Karaganda Zoo in soviet Kazakhstan, can say phrases like "Batyr is good" and verbs like "drink" and "give", a Moscow newspaper reported yesterday. It's said that a recording of its voice was heard recently on Kazakh state radio. "He just pushes his trunk into his mouth and starts talking," said the deputy director of the zoo, Mr Boris Kosinsky. He told a correspondent from the Young Communist League newspaper that it all began three years ago when a startled night watchman reported that he had heard the elephant talking to itself —''The [[Daily Telegraph]]'', 9 April 1980.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Carlo Lodoli'''  (1690 – October 27, 1761) was an Italian [[architectural theory|architectural theorist]], Franciscan priest, mathematician and teacher, whose work anticipated modernist notions of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]] and [[truth to materials]]. He claimed that architectural forms and proportions should be derived from the abilities of the material being used. He is sometimes referred to as the [[Socrates]] of architecture since his own writings have been lost his theories are only known from the works of others. Together with architects and architectural theorists including [[Claude Perrault]], Abbé [[Jean-Louis de Cordemoy]], Abbé [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]], Lodoli articulated a [[rational architecture]] which challenged the prevailing [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;Kostof, Spiro (1985) ''A History of Architecture''. Oxford University Press, New York. p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Girolamo Zanetti]] records that after 20 years of writing Lodoli finished his treatise on architecture but refused to publish it. Instead [[Francesco Algarotti]] endeavoured to publicise Lodoli's thinking in his own work ''Saggio sopra l'architettura'' (1757) albeit in a somewhat watered down form, emphasising imitation rather than Lodoli's daring anti-Baroque rationalism. It was [[Andrea Memmo]] who attempted to do justice to Lodoli's theories in his work ''Elementi d'architettura lodoliana'' (1786) published one year before the first edition of the only book bearing Lodoli's name, ''Apologhi immaginati'' (1787); a collection remarks and tales, often paradoxical in nature, told to his friends and pupils. Another pupil of Lodoli's, [[Francesco Milizia]] (1725–1798) published a long treatise, ''Principles of Civic Architecture'' (1781), which presented an exhaustive architectural system inspired by contemporary science.&lt;ref&gt;Lefaivre, Liane and Alexander Tzonis (2004) ''The emergence of modern architecture: a documentary history from 1000 to 1810'' Routledge, London and New York. p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lodoli spent the years 1739 to 1751 in the office of Padre Generale Commissario di Terra Santa in Venice, here he committed himself to the restoration (1739–43) of the pilgrim's hospice attached to the monastery. This was his only built architectural work.

The '''Catlin Seaview Survey''', later renamed the '''XL Catlin Seaview Survey''', was a major scientific expedition which commenced in September 2012, whose aim was to document the composition and [[Environmental issues with coral reefs|health]] of [[coral reef]]s worldwide. Specifically, the survey aimed to "carry out a rapid assessment of the current state of coral reef systems and to make this scientific record publicly available for scientists worldwide to use". The survey was sponsored by the [[Catlin Group]] until the survey ended when the Catlin group ended sponsorship. The original team created a film, chasing coral and a new, global initiative known as 50 reefs.&lt;ref name=CSSMain2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Catlin Seaview Survey|url=http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The survey started in September 2012, and was focused on sections of the [[Great Barrier Reef]] across a range of depths. Specifically, 32 reefs were sampled, which equated to approximately {{convert|150|km}} of reef. This produced around 105,000 images, which are currently being analysed by scientists globally,&lt;ref name=CSSAbout2014&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/about|work=Catlin Seaview Survey|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; using image recognition software.&lt;ref name=CSSScience2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Science|url=http://catlinseaviewsurvey.com/science|work=Catlin Seaview Survey|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to imaging shallow reefs, the deeper reef was sampled. This also led to the discovery of the deepest known coral reef in the Great Barrier Reef, which is located at a depth of {{convert|125|m}}.

This initial success led to the continuation of the survey globally. In 2013, the survey focussed on sampling corals in the [[Caribbean sea]] and [[Bermuda]]. Other sites are also being explored in 2014.&lt;ref name="CSSAbout2014"/&gt;

==Surveying==

[[File:Seaview SVII Camera.jpg|thumb|The [[Seaview SVII]] Camera, used extensively throughout the Catlin Seaview Survey.]]

The status of surveyed reefs is being documented using [[Optical resolution|high-resolution]], 360-degree [[Panorama|panoramic]] vision.&lt;ref name='CSSAbout2014'/&gt; These images are [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]-tagged with camera direction recorded, documenting precise locations. This method of documentation is intended to form a visual record of the world's reefs, allowing different reefs to be visually compared, and individual reefs to be monitored over time. This imaging also aims to help both the general public and specific groups (e.g. policy makers) better identify and understand the threats facing coral reefs. Likewise, these images are intended to assist the formation of strategies to protect reefs.

To survey deeper reefs, specialist divers and [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s (ROUVs) are being utilised. The temperatures of these deep reefs are also being monitored. In addition, biological samples are being collected to identify potential genetic links between shallow and deep coral systems, which could be important for conservation. Pulsed Amplitude Modulated (PAM) stress detection devices are also being used in deeper reefs to monitor stress levels.

Much of this imaging was produced using the [[Seaview SVII|SVII Camera]]. The SVII is a self-propelling underwater panoramic camera, and was designed by the survey team. The camera can be controlled by a diver, and is propelled at a constant speed. The Seaview SVII-S has also been designed, and is a lighter, human-propelled version of the SVII which can be transported by a single person. Underwater [[Tablet computer|tablet]]s are used to control the cameras and observe real-time images, and have also been used for communication, especially with [[social media]]. 

As mentioned, ROUVs are used to sample deeper reefs. These are highly mobile, and can operate at low depths. These ROUVs also contain scientific equipment which can be altered depending on the sampling being carried out, and can carry out sampling. As with the low-depth cameras, these ROUVs are able to produce high definition geo-positioned images.&lt;ref name="CSSScience2014"/&gt;

==Catlin Global Reef Record==

Data from the Catlin Seaview Survey has been used to construct the [[Catlin Global Reef Record]], which was launched in 2013. This database contains images and data collected by the Catlin Seaview Survey and by other coral reef research.&lt;ref name="CSSScience2014"/&gt; However, the huge photographic records generated by the Catlin Seaview Survey are the main aspect of this record. The Catlin Global Reef Record is freely available to scientists globally, and can be used to analyse these reef environments and monitor their change.&lt;ref name=GRRHome2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://globalreefrecord.org/home_scientific|work=Global Reef Record|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ceramic glaze''' is an impervious layer or coating of a [[vitreous enamel|vitreous]] substance which has been fused to a [[ceramic]] body through firing. Glaze can serve to color, decorate or waterproof an item.&lt;ref name="Division"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Statistics of U.S. Businesses Main Page|url = https://www.census.gov/econ/susb/index.html|website = www.census.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27|language = EN-US|first = Company Statistics|last = Division|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151126030511/http://www.census.gov/econ/susb/index.html|archive-date = 2015-11-26|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glazing renders [[earthenware]] vessels suitable for holding liquids, sealing the inherent [[porosity]] of unglazed [[biscuit (pottery)|biscuit]] earthenware. It also gives a tougher surface. Glaze is also used on [[stoneware]] and [[porcelain]]. In addition to their functionality, glazes can form a variety of surface finishes, including degrees of glossy or matte finish and color. Glazes may also enhance the underlying design or texture either unmodified or inscribed, carved or painted.

Most [[pottery]] produced in recent centuries has been glazed, other than pieces in unglazed [[terracotta]], [[biscuit porcelain]] or some other types. [[Tile]]s are almost always glazed on the surface face, and modern [[architectural terracotta]] is very often [[glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazed]].  Glazed brick is also common.  Domestic sanitary ware is invariably glazed, as are many ceramics used in industry, for example ceramic insulators for [[overhead power line]]s.

The most important groups of traditional glazes, named after their main [[ceramic flux]]ing agent, are:

*[[Lead-glazed earthenware]], is shiny and transparent after firing, which needs only about {{convert|800|C}}.  It has been used for about 2,000 years around the Mediterranean, in Europe, and China. It includes ''[[sancai]]'' and [[Victorian majolica]].
*[[Tin-glazed pottery]], which coats the ware with an opaque white glaze. Known in the [[Ancient Near East]] and then important in [[Islamic pottery]], from which it passed to Europe. Includes [[faience]], [[maiolica]], [[majolica]] and [[Delftware]].   
*[[Salt glaze pottery|Salt-glazed ware]], mostly European stoneware. It uses ordinary salt.
*[[Ash glaze]], important in East Asia, simply made from wood or plant ash, which contains [[potash]] and [[Lime (material)|lime]]. 
*[[Feldspath]]ic glazes of porcelain.

Modern [[materials technology]] has invented new vitreous glazes that do not fall into these traditional categories.

==Composition==
Glazes need to include a [[ceramic flux]] which functions by promoting partial liquefaction in the clay bodies and the other glaze materials. Fluxes lower the high melting point of the glass formers [[silica]], and sometimes [[boron trioxide]].  These glass formers may be included in the glaze materials, or may be drawn from the clay beneath. 
 
Raw materials of ceramic glazes generally include silica, which will be the main glass former. Various metal oxides, such as [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[calcium]], act as [[ceramic flux|flux]] and therefore lower the melting temperature. [[Alumina]], often derived from [[clay]], stiffens the molten glaze to prevent it from running off the piece.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_CsrDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA694&amp;dq=%C2%A0Raw+materials+of+ceramic+glazes+generally+include+silica,+which+will+be+the+main+glass+forme#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0Raw%20materials%20of%20ceramic%20glazes%20generally%20include%20silica,%20which%20will%20be%20the%20main%20glass%20forme&amp;f=false|title=S.Chands Success Guide (Q&amp;A) Inorganic Chemistry|last=Madan|first=Gaurav|date=2005|publisher=S. Chand Publishing|isbn=9788121918572|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorants, such as [[iron oxide]], [[Basic copper carbonate|copper carbonate]], or [[cobalt carbonate]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and sometimes opacifiers like [[tin oxide]] or [[zirconium oxide]], are used to modify the visual appearance of the fired glaze.

==Process==
[[File:Enderun library Topkapi 42.JPG|thumb|[[İznik tiles]] in the [[Enderûn Library]], [[Topkapi Palace]], [[Istanbul]]]]
Glaze may be applied by dry-dusting a dry mixture over the surface of the clay body or by inserting salt or soda into the kiln at high temperatures to create an atmosphere rich in sodium vapor that interacts with the aluminium and silica oxides in the body to form and deposit glass, producing what is known as [[salt glaze pottery]]. Most commonly, glazes in aqueous suspension of various powdered [[mineral]]s and metal [[oxide]]s are applied by dipping pieces directly into the glaze. Other techniques include pouring the glaze over the piece, spraying it onto the piece with an [[airbrush]] or similar tool, or applying it directly with a brush or other tool.

To prevent the glazed article from sticking to the [[kiln]] during firing, either a small part of the item is left unglazed, or it's supported on small refractory supports such as [[kiln spurs]] and [[Stilt (ceramics)|Stilt]]s that are removed and discarded after the firing. Small marks left by these spurs are sometimes visible on finished ware.

Decoration applied under the glaze on pottery is generally referred to as [[underglaze]]. Underglazes are applied to the surface of the pottery, which can be either raw, "greenware", or "[[Bisque (pottery)|biscuit]]"-fired (an initial firing of some articles before the glazing and re-firing).&lt;ref&gt;"Cleaning Biscuit Fired Ceramic Ware" Hulse D.K, Barnett W.C.

Ceram. Inf.(Spain) 20, No.202. 1994. Pg. 25–27&lt;/ref&gt; A wet glaze—usually transparent—is applied over the decoration. The pigment fuses with the glaze, and appears to be underneath a layer of clear glaze. An example of underglaze decoration is the well-known "[[Blue and white porcelain|blue and white]]" [[porcelain]] famously produced in [[Spode|England]], [[Delftware|the Netherlands]], China, and [[Imari porcelain|Japan]]. The striking blue color uses [[Cobalt blue|cobalt]] as cobalt oxide or cobalt carbonate.&lt;ref&gt;'Ceramics Glaze Technology.' J.R.Taylor &amp; A.C.Bull. ''The Institute Of Ceramics &amp; Pergamon Press.'' Oxford. 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Polychrome glazed pottery statue of heavenly guardian.jpg|thumb|[[Sancai]] lead-glazed figure of heavenly guardian, [[Tang dynasty]]]]

Decoration applied on top of a layer of glaze is referred to as [[overglaze]]. Overglaze methods include applying one or more layers or coats of glaze on a piece of [[pottery]] or by applying a non-glaze substance such as [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] or metals (e.g., [[gold leaf]]) over the glaze.

Overglaze colors are low-temperature glazes that give ceramics a more decorative, glassy look. A piece is fired first, this initial firing being called the '''glost firing''', then the overglaze decoration is applied, and it is fired again. Once the piece is fired and comes out of the kiln, its texture is smoother due to the glaze.

==History==
Historically, glazing of ceramics developed rather slowly, as appropriate materials needed to be discovered, and also firing technology able to reliably reach the necessary temperatures was needed.

Glazed brick goes back to the [[Elam]]ite Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BC.  The [[Iron Pagoda]], built in 1049 in [[Kaifeng]], [[China]], of glazed bricks is a well-known later example.&lt;ref name="gao"&gt;{{cite book

Lead glazed earthenware was probably made in China during the Warring States Period (475 – 221 BCE), and its production increased during the Han Dynasty. High temperature proto-celadon glazed stoneware was made earlier than glazed earthenware, since the Shang Dynasty (1600 – 1046 BCE).  &lt;ref name="Zhiyan"&gt;{{cite book

During the [[Kofun period]] of Japan, [[Sue ware]] was decorated with greenish natural [[ash glaze]]s. From 552 to 794 AD, differently colored glazes were introduced. The three colored glazes of the [[Tang Dynasty]] were frequently used for a period, but were gradually phased out; the precise colors and compositions of the glazes have not been recovered. Natural ash glaze, however, was commonly used throughout the country.

In the 13th century, flower designs were painted with red, blue, green, yellow and black overglazes. Overglazes became very popular because of the particular look they gave [[Ceramic art|ceramics]].

From the eighth century, the use of glazed ceramics was prevalent in [[Islamic art]] and [[Islamic pottery]], usually in the form of elaborate [[pottery]].&lt;ref name="Environment"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)|url = https://www.environment.gov.au/protection/publications/factsheet-nitrogen-dioxide-no2|website = www.environment.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-11-09|first = Department of the|last = Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tin-glazing|Tin-opacified glazing]] was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of [[stoneware]], originating from 9th century Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Other centers for innovative ceramic pottery in the Islamic world included [[Fustat]] (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and [[Tabriz]] (from 1470 to 1550).&lt;ref name="Missoun, F. 2010"&gt;Missoun, F., M. Slimani, and A. Aoues. "Toxic Effect of Lead on Kidney Function in Rat Wistar." African Journal of Biochemistry Research 4.2 (2010): 21–27. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
As of 2012, over 650 ceramic manufacturing establishments were reported in the United States.&lt;ref name="Division"/&gt; Floor tile, wall tile, sanitary-ware, bathroom accessories, kitchenware, and tableware are all potential ceramic-containing products that are available for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Protection Agency.

=== Metal oxide chemistry ===
Metals used in ceramic glazes are typically in the form of metal oxides.

==== Lead(II) oxide ====
Ceramic manufacturers primarily use [[lead(II) oxide]] (PbO) as a flux for its low melting range, wide firing range, low surface tension, high index of refraction, and resistance to [[devitrification]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Lehman, Richard. ''Lead Glazes for Ceramic Foodware''. 1st ed. Research Triangle Park: International Lead Management Center, 2002. [http://www.ilmc.org/Publications/ILMCFinalCombo8-02B.pdf  International Lead Management Center  ]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In polluted environments, [[nitrogen dioxide]] reacts with water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) to produce [[nitrous acid]] ({{chem|HNO|2}}) and [[nitric acid]] ({{chem|HNO|3}}).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{chem|H|2|O}} + 2{{chem|NO|2}} → {{chem|HNO|2}} + {{chem|HNO|3}}

Soluble [[Lead(II) nitrate]] ({{chem|Pb(NO|3|)|2}}) forms when lead(II) oxide (PbO) of leaded glazes is exposed to [[nitric acid]] ({{chem|HNO|3}}) 

PbO + 2{{chem|HNO|3}} → {{chem|Pb(NO|3|)|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

Because lead exposure is strongly linked to a variety of health problems, collectively referred to as [[lead poisoning]], the disposal of leaded glass (chiefly in the form of discarded CRT displays) and lead-glazed ceramics is subject to [[toxic waste]] regulations.

==== Chromium(III) oxide ====
[[Chromium(III) oxide]] ({{chem|Cr|2|O|3}}) is used as a colorant in ceramic glazes. Chromium(III) oxide can undergo a reaction with [[calcium oxide]] (CaO) and atmospheric oxygen in temperatures reached by a kiln to produce [[calcium chromate]] ({{chem|CaCrO|4}}). The oxidation reaction changes chromium from its +3 [[oxidation state]] to its +6 oxidation state.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Heating Temperature Dependence of Cr(III) Oxidation in the Presence of Alkali and Alkaline Earth Salts and Subsequent Cr(VI) Leaching Behavior|journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date = 2013-06-04|issn = 0013-936X|pages = 5858–5863|volume = 47|issue = 11|doi = 10.1021/es4001455|pmid = 23635007|first = Bram|last = Verbinnen|first2 = Pieter|last2 = Billen|first3 = Michiel|last3 = Van Coninckxloo|first4 = Carlo|last4 = Vandecasteele}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium(VI) is very soluble and the most mobile out of all the other stable forms of chromium.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chromium as an Environmental Pollutant: Insights on Induced Plant Toxicity|journal = Journal of Botany|date = 2012-05-20|pages = 1–8|volume = 2012|doi = 10.1155/2012/375843|first = Helena|last = Oliveira}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromium may enter water systems via industrial discharge. Chromium(VI) can enter the environment directly or oxidants present in soils can react with chromium(III) to produce chromium(VI). Plants have reduced amounts of chlorophyll when grown in the presence of chromium(VI).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Prevention ===
Chromium oxidation during manufacturing processes can be reduced with the introduction of compounds that bind to calcium.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Ceramic industries are reluctant to use lead alternatives since leaded glazes provide products with a brilliant shine and smooth surface. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has experimented with a dual glaze, barium alternative to lead, but they were unsuccessful in achieving the same optical effect as leaded glazes.

There are many definitions of co-production. One technical definition is that '''Co-production''' is where technical experts and other groups co-generate new knowledge and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Christenson. ''The Co-production of Archaeological Knowledge: The 	Essential Relationship of Amateurs and Professionals in 20th Century American Archaeology. Complutum (Universidad Complutense de Madrid) 24(2): 63-72, 2013 https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/CMPL/article/view/43367&lt;/ref&gt; It is the dynamic interaction between [[technology and society]]. It has a long history, particularly arising out of radical theories of knowledge in the 1970s.

==Description==
Co-production forms part of [[Mode 2]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gibbons, Camille Limoges, Helga Nowotny, Simon Schwartzman, Peter Scott and Martin Trow ''The New Production of Knowledge: The dynamics of science and research in contemporary societies'' Sage. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila. ''States of Knowledge: The Co-Production of Science and the Social Order''.  Routledge.  2004. {{ISBN|978-0-415-40329-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbers, Hans. ''Inside the Politics of Technology: Agency and Normativity in the Co-Production of Technology and Society''.  Amsterdam University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|978-90-5356-756-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term used in the [[sociology of science]] to describe one of the modes, or ways that knowledge is formed. In [[Mode 2]], science and technology studies the move from extreme [[technological determinism]] and [[social constructivism]], to a more systemic understanding of how technology and society ‘co-produce’ each other. Co-production is functionally comparable to the concepts of [[causality loop]], [[positive feedback]], and [[co-evolution]] – all of which describe how two or more variables of a system affect and essentially create each other, albeit with respect to different variables operating at different scales. And as with these other concepts, if used too broadly/uncritically, co-production risks [[noetic flatness]] – if technology and society co-produce each other equally, the justification for maintaining the boundary between them dissolves (in which case [[actor-network theory]] may be invoked). Unless overlapping sets of [[boundary-work]] are employed, co-production may also fail to account for power differentials within each variable, (in this case, within technology and society).

==Science, technology and society==
From a more [[Science, technology and society|STS]] perspective, [[Sheila Jasanoff]], has written that "Co-production is shorthand for the proposition that the ways in which we know and represent the world (both nature and society) are inseparable from the ways in which we chose to live in." Co-production draws on constitutive (such as [[Actor–network theory]]) and interactional work ([[Leviathan and the Air-Pump|such as the Edinburgh School]]) in [[Science, technology and society|STS]].  As a sensitizing concept, the idiom of co-production looks at four themes: "the emergence and stabilization of new techno-scientific objects and framings, the resolution of scientific and technical controversies; the processes by which the products of techno-science are made intelligible and portable across boundaries; and the adjustment of science’s cultural practices in response to the contexts in which science is done."  Studies employing co-production often follow the following pathways: "making identities, making institutions, making discourses, and making representations"&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila. States of Knowledge: The Co-Production of Science and the Social Order. Routledge. 2004 http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic251437.files/Fall%202007%20papers/Jasanoff_papers/Jasanoff_States_of_Knowledge_Ch2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11547">The '''conservation and restoration of outdoor artworks''' is the activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of artworks that are exhibited or permanently installed outside. These works may be made of [[Wood art|wood]], [[Stone sculpture|stone]], [[Conservation and restoration of ceramic objects|ceramic material]], [[Plastic arts|plastic]], [[Conservation and restoration of outdoor bronze artworks|bronze]], [[Conservation and restoration of copper-based objects|copper]], or any other number of materials and may or may not be painted.  When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].
[[File:Applying wax to a bronze sculpture.jpg|thumb|300px|Artist [[Brose Partington]] applies wax using a torch to a bronze sculpture.]]

==Environmental issues==
Unlike many works of [[cultural heritage]], outdoor artworks are not exhibited in a controlled environment, where [[temperature]] and [[relative humidity]] are closely monitored.  Though works may be more easily preserved in a controlled environment, they are installed outside to preserve the [[Artist's statement|artist's intent]], and avoid decontextualization.&lt;ref name="Chiantore"&gt;Chiantore, Oscar, and A. Rava. (2005).  ''Conserving Contemporary Art: Issues, Methods, Materials, and Research.'' Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, outdoor works are exposed to many and various [[environmental factors]] depending upon its geographic or site location and its configuration.&lt;ref name = "Naude"&gt;Naudė, Virginia N. (1985). ''Sculptural Monuments in an Outdoor Environment''.  Philadelphia, PA: Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental threats may include, but are not limited to rain, snow, [[acid rain]], and earthquakes as well as fluctuations in [[temperature]] and [[relative humidity]].  They may also be exposed to excessive amounts of light as well as human intervention. Excessive rain and moisture can also lead to mold growth.  Daily exposure to [[Ultraviolet light|ultraviolet]], [[Visible light|visible]], and [[Infrared light|infrared (IR)]] radiation has a detrimental effect on painted sculptures or those with organic or inorganic coatings. Excessive light exposure may cause color alterations and loss as well as structural breakdowns in the paint and coatings.&lt;ref name="Consodine"&gt;Considine, Brian B. (2010). ''Conserving Outdoor Sculpture: The Stark Collection at the Getty Center''. Los Angeles, CA: The Getty Conservation Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air pollution]] can also adversely affect outdoor artworks.  In addition to meteorological conditions, traditional outdoor pollutants including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and [[ozone]] affect the various composite materials.&lt;ref name="Grzywacz"&gt;Grzywacz, Cecily M. (2006). ''Monitoring for Gaseous Pollutants in Museum Environments''.  Tools for Conservation.  Los Angeles, CA: Getty Conservation Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  The specific level and type of air pollution degradation is dependent on the material and composition of the artwork as well as the length of exposure. Organic carbonyl pollutants are also an increasing threat due increased use of ethanol based fuels.&lt;ref name="Grzywacz"/&gt;

==Contemporary conservation methods==
Though specific conservation methods are dependent on the material, condition, and environment for each artwork, there are some standard practices for outdoor works. These include condition assessment, treatment, [[preventive conservation]], and maintenance.

===Assessment of condition===
Before any conservation treatment, a thorough condition assessment with written and photographic documentation is completed.  This initial assessment may include research into the artist's working techniques or a discussion with the living artist, review of the conservation history of the object, and non-destructive analysis.

According to Virginia Naudé and Glenn Wharton, there are four steps that come with the assessment or survey of an outdoor sculpture:&lt;ref&gt;Naudé, Virginia N. (1993). ''Guide to the Maintenance of Outdoor Sculpture''. Washington, D.C.: American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Technical descriptions and condition assessments of each sculpture''': Identification and exploration of materials, fabrication, past maintenance practices, surface condition, and structural integrity. This also includes an assessment of previous repairs, treatment and/or maintenance.
# '''Maintenance recommendations for each sculpture''': Recommendations based on the history, condition, and location of the sculpture, the resources of the owner, and the relative needs of the sculpture in the context of the whole collection. The maintenance recommendation should include information on routine care and periodic treatment.
# '''Assignment of priorities to recommended activities''': [[Conservator-restorer|Conservator]]-assigned priorities based on the previously attained technical information. These priorities will later be assessed by [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in relation to art historical, fund-raising, and other priorities.
# '''Estimate of resources required''': Includes labor costs of the various maintenance options proposed for conservators, technicians, and other specialists. An estimate of hours is particularly useful if the recommended work will not take place immediately. Supplies and equipment costs are also included.
 
===Treatment of outdoor artworks===
The treatment of outdoor artworks is multifaceted and dependent on the material type, condition, structural integrity, and exhibition conditions. A brief overview of conservation treatments by material is outlined below, and more thorough discussions are available on the individual conservation pages.

* [[Conservation and restoration of outdoor bronze artworks|Bronze sculptures]]: For many bronze sculptures and other metal sculptures, treatment includes a reduction buildup from previous protective coatings, removal of corrosion and incrustation, or cleaning.  This may be done by hand, water blasting, air abrasion, or other methods.  Then, a wax or wax composite is applied to the sculpture in sweeping motions.  Finally, the wax is buffed with a cotton cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Kipper, Patrick V. (1996). ''The Care of Bronze Sculpture: Recommended Maintenance Programs for the Collector''. Loveland, CO: Path Publications. {{ISBN|0964726912}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Conservation and restoration of ceramic objects|Ceramic sculptures]]: Ceramic sculptures are much less common than bronze sculptures, and require a different conservation and maintenance procedures.  Mechanical and chemical cleaning methods may be used, and previous conservation treatments and adhesives may be removed.  Next, consolidation of fragments and flaking glaze may be completed.  For sculptures comprised with multiple ceramic parts joined with mortar, the grout may also require conservation intervention.&lt;ref name="Consodine"/&gt;
*[[Plastic arts|Plastic sculptures]]:  Plastic elements are prevalent in contemporary sculptures.  Outdoor sculptures may be made entire or in part of [[polyester]], [[epoxy]], [[phenol]], or [[Acrylic resin|acrylic materials]].&lt;ref name="Chiantore"/&gt; Unfortunately, treatment for plastic sculptures may be limited as some changes from degradation in plastics are not reversible.
*Painted sculptures:  As Brian Consodine writes, painted sculptures are actually a multi-layered composition that can contain [[primer (paint)|primer]]s, [[paints]], and [[protective coatings]] as well as the structural substrate.&lt;ref name="Consodine"/&gt;  Problems that may occur with painted sculptures include degradation or alteration of color, cracking and flaking of paint, and failure of the primer layer which exposes the underlying primary support to the elements.  Treatments for painted sculptures may include reduction of previous coatings and repairs, cleaning, consolidation, and inpainting of losses.

===Preventive conservation===
[[File:Tool used to maintain a bronze sculpture.JPG|thumb|Wax and a brush used to maintain a bronze sculpture.]]
[[Preventive conservation]] involves actions taken to delay deterioration of [[cultural heritage]].  For outdoor artworks, this usually involves the application of a protective coating and regular maintenance.  The particular protective coating is chosen based on its durability, adhesion to the surface, ease of maintenance, and surface appearance on the work.&lt;ref name="Naude"/&gt; The coating provides some protection from [[environmental factors]], but must be occasionally be reduced and reapplied for best results.  A long-term conservation schedule should be created and implemented to ensure the longevity of the artwork.  A maintenance walk-through schedule should also be established to routinely check the condition of the objects.  This may be a weekly procedure; it is useful as conservators can assess and document any damage caused by visitors or environmental conditions, and may rinse and wipe down sculptures.&lt;ref name="Consodine"/&gt;

Small-eyed, long-snouted animals (right column) do not elicit the same response." —[[Konrad Lorenz]]&lt;ref name="Mickey" /&gt;]]

'''Cuteness''' is a subjective term describing a type of [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]] commonly associated with [[youth]] and [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], as well as a scientific concept and analytical model in [[ethology]], first introduced by [[Konrad Lorenz]].&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz, Konrad. ''Studies in Animal and Human Behavior''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ Press; 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz proposed the concept of baby schema (''Kindchenschema''), a set of facial and body features, that make a creature appear "cute" and activate ("release") in others the motivation to care for it.&lt;ref name="Glocker2"&gt;Glocker ML, Langleben DD, Ruparel K, Loughead JW, Valdez JN, Griffin MD, Sachser N, Gur RC. [http://www.pnas.org/content/106/22/9115.figures-only "Baby schema modulates the brain reward system in nulliparous women."] ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences – U.S.A'' 2009 June 2;106(22):9115–9119.&lt;/ref&gt; Cuteness may be ascribed to people as well as things that are regarded as attractive or charming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/cute "cute, adj."]. OED Online. March 2012. Oxford University Press. (accessed April 29, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Juvenile traits ==
[[File:Kopfproportionen.svg|thumb|Change of head proportions (especially the relative size of the [[maxilla]] and [[mandible]]) as a function of age]]

Doug Jones, a [[visiting scholar]] in anthropology at [[Cornell University]],&lt;!-- His qualifications are given on the first page of the article. --&gt; said that the proportions of facial features change with age due to changes in hard tissue and soft tissue, and Jones said that these "age-related changes" cause juvenile animals to have the "characteristic 'cute' appearance" of proportionately smaller snouts, higher foreheads and larger eyes than their adult counterparts. In terms of hard tissue, Jones said that the [[neurocranium]] grows a lot in juveniles while the bones for the nose and the parts of the skull involved in chewing food only reach maximum growth later. In terms of soft tissue, Jones said that the [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] tissues of the ears and nose continue to grow throughout a person's lifetime, starting at age twenty-five the eyebrows descend on the "[[Supraorbital ridge|supraorbital rim]]" from a position above the supraorbital rim to a position below it, the "lateral aspect of the eyebrows" sags with age, making the eyes appear smaller, and the red part of the lips gets thinner with age due to loss of connective tissue.&lt;!-- This was found on page 728 at the bottom and 729 at the top. --&gt;&lt;ref name="DJones" /&gt;

A study found that the faces of "attractive"&lt;!-- The study did not use the word "cute", but an "attractive" child's face would normally be interpreted as being synonymous with a cute child's face.--&gt; [[Northern Italy|Northern Italian]] Caucasian&lt;!-- On page 595, Sforza says the study used Northern Italian Caucasians.--&gt; children have "characteristics of babyness" such as a "larger forehead", a smaller jaw, "a proportionately larger and more prominent [[maxilla]]", a wider face, a flatter face and larger "[[anteroposterior]]" facial dimensions than the Northern Italian Caucasian children used as a [[reference]].&lt;!-- This information is on page 604.

===Biological function===
Konrad Lorenz argued in 1949 that infantile features triggered nurturing responses in adults and that this was an evolutionary adaptation which helped ensure that adults cared for their children, ultimately securing the survival of the species. Some later scientific studies have provided further evidence for Lorenz's theory. For example, it has been shown that human adults react positively to infants who are [[stereotype|stereotypically]] cute. Studies have also shown that responses to cuteness—and to facial attractiveness in general—seem to be similar across and within cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Van Duuren, Mike; Kendell-Scott, Linda; Stark, Natalie. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927105817/http://www.winchester.ac.uk/view.ashx?Item=15993 "Early Aesthetic Choices: Infant Preferences for Attractive Premature Infant Faces"] (PDF), King Alfred's College. Archived from [http://www.winchester.ac.uk/view.ashx?Item=15993 the original].&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Stephan Hamann of [[Emory University]], he found using an [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]], that cute pictures increased brain activity in the [[Orbitofrontal cortex|orbital frontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Agreed, Baby Pandas Are Cute.

==Growth pattern of children==
Desmond Collins, who was an Extension Lecturer of Archaeology at [[London University]],&lt;ref&gt;(1970). Special Issue: Early Man. World Archaeology Volume 2, Issue 1, DOI: 10.1080/00438243.1970.9979467 page 112 [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00438243.1970.9979467?journalCode=rwar20#.VGwIFYdYvls link]&lt;/ref&gt; said that the lengthened youth period of humans is part of [[neoteny]].&lt;!-- This is on page 15.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;Collins, D. et al. (1973). Background to archaeology: Britain in its European setting. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-20155-1}} hard cover&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical anthropologist [[Barry Bogin]] said that the pattern of children's growth may intentionally increase the duration of their cuteness. Bogin said that the human brain reaches adult size when the body is only 40 percent complete, when "dental maturation is only 58 percent complete" and when "reproductive maturation is only 10 percent complete". Bogin said that this [[allometry]] of human growth allows children to have a "superficially infantile" appearance (large [[skull]], small face, small body and sexual underdevelopment) longer than in other "[[mammal]]ian species". Bogin said that this cute appearance causes a "nurturing" and "care-giving" response in "older individuals".&lt;!-- This was on page 83.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogin, B. (1997). Evolutionary Hypotheses for Human Childhood. Yearbook of Physical Anthropology, vol. 40, pp. 63–89&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender differences ==
The perceived cuteness of an infant is influenced by the [[gender]] and behavior of the infant.&lt;ref name=Koyama&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koyama|first=Reiko |author2=Takahashi, Yuwen |author3=Mori, Kazuo|title=Assessing the cuteness of children: Significant factors and gender differences|journal=Social Behavior and Personality|year=2006|volume=34|pages=1087–1100|doi=10.2224/sbp.2006.34.9.1087|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karraker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karraker|first=Katherine|author2=Stern, Marilyn|title=Infant physical attractiveness and facial expression: Effects on adult perceptions|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15324834basp1104_2#.UihZBbwic38|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|year=1990|volume=11|pages=371–385|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp1104_2|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Koyama et al. (2006) research, female infants are seen as cute for the physical attraction that female infants display more than male infants;&lt;ref name=Koyama /&gt; whereas research by Karraker (1990) demonstrates that a caregiver's attention and involvement in the male infant's protection could be solely based on the perception of happiness and attractiveness of the child.&lt;ref name=Karraker /&gt;

The gender of an observer can determine their perception of the difference in cuteness. In a study by Sprengelmeyer et al. (2009) it was suggested that women were more sensitive to small differences in cuteness than the same aged men. This suggests that reproductive [[hormone]]s in women are important for determining cuteness.&lt;ref name="Sprengelmeyer, R 2009 PP 149-154"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sprengelmeyer | first1 = R | last2 = Perrett | first2 = D. | last3 = Fagan | first3 = E. | last4 = Cornwell | first4 = R. | last5 = Lobmaier | first5 = J. | last6 = Sprengelmeyer | first6 = A. | last7 = Aasheim | first7 = H. | last8 = Black | first8 = I. | last9 = Cameron | first9 = L. | last10 = Crow | first10 = S. | last11 = Milne | first11 = N. | last12 = Rhodes | first12 = E. | last13 = Young | first13 = A. | year = 2009 | title = The Cutest Little Baby Face: A Hormonal Link to Sensitivity to Cuteness in Infant Faces | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 9| pages = 149–154 | pmid = 19175530 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02272.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This finding has also been demonstrated in a study conducted by T.R. Alley in which he had 25 undergraduate students (consisting of 7 men and 18 women) rate cuteness of infants depending on different characteristics such as age, behavioral traits, and physical characteristics such as head shape, and facial feature configuration.&lt;ref name="Alley"/&gt;

==Preference in young children==
Borgi et al. stated that young children demonstrate a preference for faces with a more "infantile facial" arrangement i.e. a rounder face, a higher forehead, bigger eyes, a smaller nose and a smaller mouth.&lt;!-- This was found in the "BABY SCHEMA AND CUTENESS PERCEPTION" section. --&gt; In a study that used three- to six-year-old children, Borgi et al. asserted that the children showed a viewing time preference toward the eyes of "high infantile" faces of dogs, cats and humans as opposed to "low infantile" faces of those three species.&lt;!-- This was found in the paragraph immediately before the "Discussion" section. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borgi, M. et al. (2014). Baby schema in human and animal faces induces cuteness perception and gaze allocation in children. In Frontiers in Psychology. 5(411).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hormones and cuteness variation ==
There are suggestions that hormone levels can affect a person's perception of cuteness. Konrad Lorenz suggests that "caretaking behaviour and affective orientation" towards infants as an innate mechanism, and this is triggered by cute characteristics such as "chubby cheeks" and large eyes. The Sprengelmeyer et al. (2009) study expands on this claim by manipulating baby pictures to test groups on their ability to detect differences in cuteness. The studies show that [[menopause|premenopausal]] women detected cuteness better than same aged postmenopausal women. Furthermore, to support this claim, women taking [[birth control pill]]s that raise levels of reproductive hormones detect cuteness better than same aged women not taking the pill.&lt;ref name="Sprengelmeyer, R 2009 PP 149-154"/&gt;

Sprengelmeyer gathered 24 young women, 24 young men, and 24 older women to participate in his study. He ran three studies in which images of white European babies were shown, and the participants were asked to rate them on a cuteness scale of one to seven. The study found differences among the groups in cuteness discrimination, which ruled out [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] and social influences on perceived cuteness. In the second study it was found that premenopausal women discriminated cuteness at a higher level than their postmenopausal female peers. This finding suggested a biological factor, which was then investigated further in the third study. Here, Sprengelmeyer compared cuteness sensitivity between premenopausal women who were, and were not taking oral contraceptives. The study concluded that post-perceptual processes were impacted by hormone levels ([[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]] specifically) in females, and thus impacted sensitivity to cuteness.&lt;ref name="Sprengelmeyer, R 2009 PP 149-154"/&gt;

== Caregiving correlates ==
A study by Konrad Lorenz in the early 1940s found that the shape of an infant's head positively correlated with adult caregiving and an increased perception of "cute". However a study by Thomas Alley found no such correlation and pointed out faulty procedures in that study. Alley's study found that cephalic head shape of an infant did induce a positive response from adults, and these children were considered to be more "cute". In his study, Alley had 25 undergraduate students rate line drawings of an infant's face. The same drawing was used each time, however the cephalic head shape was changed using a cardioidal transformation (a transformation that models cephalic growth in relation to ageing process) to adjust the perceived age; other features of the face were not changed.  The study concluded that a large head shape increased perceived cuteness, which then elicited a positive response in adult caretaking. The study also noted that perceived cuteness was also dependent on other physical and behavioural characteristics of the child, including age.&lt;ref name="Alley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alley|first=Thomas|title=Head shape and the perception of cuteness|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1981-32782-001|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1981|volume=17|issue=5|pages=650–654|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.17.5.650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study by McCabe (1984) of children whose ages ranged from toddlers to teenagers, the children with more "adult-like" facial proportions were more likely to have experienced physical abuse than children of the same age who had less "adult-like" facial proportions.&lt;!--This is on the bottom of page 136.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, V. &amp; Young, A. (2012). Face Perception. USA &amp; Canada: Psychology Press. {{ISBN|978-1-84169-878-6}} (hbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Karraker (1990) suggested that "an adult's beliefs about the [[personality]] and expected behavior of an infant can influence the adult's interaction with the infant", and gave evidence that in this way "basic cuteness effects may occasionally be obscured in particular infants".&lt;ref name=Karraker /&gt; Koyama (2006) said that an adult caregiver's perception of an infant's cuteness can motivate the amount of care and protection the caregiver provides, and the admiration demonstrated toward the infant, and concluded that "the adults' protective feeling for children appeared to be a more important criterion for the judgment of a boy's cuteness."&lt;ref name=Koyama /&gt;

Melanie Glocker (2009) provided experimental evidence that infants' cuteness motivates caretaking in adults, even if they are not related to the infant.&lt;ref name=Glocker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glocker|first=Melanie|author2=Daniel D.

The research suggested that individuals' rating of the perceived cuteness of an infant corresponded to the level of motivation an individual had to care for this infant.&lt;ref name=Glocker /&gt; Glocker and colleagues then used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), to demonstrate that baby faces with higher content of baby schema features, generated more activation in the [[nucleus accumbens]], a small brain area central to motivation and reward.&lt;ref name="Glocker2" /&gt; This work elucidated the neural mechanism through which baby schema (''Kindchenschema'') may motivate ("release") caretaking behavior. Furthermore, cute infants were more likely to be [[adoption|adopted]] and rated as more "likeable, friendly, healthy and competent" than infants who were less cute. There is an implication that baby schema response is crucial to human development because it lays the foundation for care giving and the relationship between child and caretaker.&lt;ref name=Glocker/&gt;

== Cultural significance ==
Doug Jones, a [[visiting scholar]] in anthropology at [[Cornell University]],&lt;!-- His qualifications are given on the first page of the article. --&gt; said that the faces of monkeys, dogs, birds and even the fronts of cars can be made to appear cuter by morphing them with a "[[cardioid]]al" ([[Heart (symbol)|heart-shaped]]) [[Transformation (function)|mathematical transformation]]. Jones said that negative cardioidal strain results in faces appearing less mature and cuter by causing facial features at the top of the face to expand outward and upward while causing features at the bottom of the face to contract inward and upward.&lt;!-- This was at the bottom of page 728. --&gt;&lt;ref name="DJones"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=D.|display-authors=etal|title=Sexual Selection, Physical Attractiveness, and Facial Neoteny: Cross-cultural Evidence and Implications [and Comments and Reply]|journal=Current Anthropology|date=December 1995|volume=36|issue=5|pages=723–748|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1601&amp;context=fchd_facpub|accessdate=22 January 2017|doi=10.1086/204427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] said that over time [[Mickey Mouse]] had been drawn to resemble a juvenile more with a relatively larger head, larger eyes, a larger and more bulging [[cranium]], a less sloping and more rounded forehead, shorter, thicker and "pudgier" legs, thicker arms and a thicker snout which gave the appearance of being less protrusive. Gould suggested that this change in Mickey's image was intended to increase his popularity by making him appear cuter and "inoffensive".&lt;!-- This was at the bottom of the first page. --&gt; Gould said that the neotenous changes to Mickey's form were similar to the [[Neoteny#Human evolution|neotenous changes that occurred in human evolution]].&lt;!--This was at the bottom of the third page. --&gt;&lt;ref name="Mickey"&gt;Gould, S.J.

W.W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nancy Etcoff, Ph.D. in psychology from [[Boston University]],&lt;!--These credentials are in "About the Author" before the table of contents.--&gt; said "cartoonists capitalize on our innate preferences for juvenile features", and she mentioned Mickey Mouse and [[Bambi]] as examples of this trend. She said Mickey Mouse's bodily proportions "aged in reverse" since his inception, because "[h]is eyes and head kept getting bigger while his limbs kept getting shorter and thicker", culminating in him resembling a "human infant". She further mentioned the "exaggerated high forehead" and the "[[wikt:doe eyes|doe eyes]]" of Bambi as another example of this trend.&lt;!-- This is in the second paragraph of the "Cuteness" section of chapter 2.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Etcoff, N. (1999). Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty. New York: Anchor Books. {{ISBN|978-0-307-77911-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estren, Ph.D. in psychology from the [[University at Buffalo]],&lt;!--These credentials are on the page after the index at the end of the book.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estren, M.J. &amp; Potter, B.A. (2013). Healing Hormones: How to Turn on Natural Chemicals to Reduce Stress. Oakland, CA: Ronin Publishing, Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-57951-180-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; said cute animals get more public attention and scientific study due to having physical characteristics that would be considered [[neoteny|neotenous]] from the perspective of [[Human development (biology)|human development]]. Estren said that humans should be mindful of their bias for cute animals, so animals that would not be considered cute are also valued in addition to cute animals.&lt;!--This was written from reading the article's abstract.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Estren | first1 = M.J. | year = 2012 | title = The Neoteny Barrier: Seeking Respect for the Non-Cute | url = | journal = Journal of Animal Ethics | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 6–11 | doi=10.5406/janimalethics.2.1.0006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception of cuteness is culturally diverse.

{{unsourced|article|date=March 2017}}
'''Embodied embedded cognition''' ('''EEC''') is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] theoretical position in [[cognitive science]], closely related to [[situated cognition]], [[embodied cognition]], [[embodied cognitive science]] and [[dynamical systems theory]]. The theory states that intelligent [[behaviour]] emerges from the interplay between [[brain]], body and world&lt;ref name=EEE1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/|title=Embodied Cognition |date=25 July  2011|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The world is not just the 'play-ground' on which the brain is acting. Rather, brain, body and world are equally important factors in the explanation of how particular intelligent behaviours come about in practice. There are concerns about whether EEC constitutes a novel and substantive approach to cognition or whether it is merely a manifestation of frustration with the classical [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] approach{{Citation needed|reason=Who has concerns? Any source?|date=June 2018}}.

==Embodiment and embeddedness==

EEC is divided into two aspects: embodiment and embeddedness (or situatedness).

''Embodiment'' refers to the idea that the body's internal milieu (a.o. [[homeostatic]] and hormonal states)  heavily influences the higher 'cognitive' processes in the brain, presumably via the [[emotion]]al system (see e.g. [[Antonio Damasio]]'s theory of [[Somatic markers hypothesis|somatic markers]]). To put it simply: the state of your body is a direct factor of importance on the kinds of [[cognitive process]]es that may arise in the higher parts of your brain.

''Embeddedness'' refers to the idea that physical interaction between the body and the world strongly constrain the possible behaviours of the organism, which in turn influences (indeed, partly constitutes) the cognitive processes that emerge from the interaction between organism and world.

The theory is an explicit reaction to the currently dominant [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] paradigm, which states that cognitive systems are essentially computational-representational systems (like computer [[software]]), processing input and generating output (behaviour) on the basis of internal information processing. In cognitivism, the causal root of behaviour lies in the 'virtual' processes governed by the software that runs on our brains. The brain is purely the [[computer hardware|hardware]] on which the software is implemented. The body (sensors and actors) are purely input-output devices that are in service of the brain. The world is merely the play-ground (the object) in which the cognitive agent acts.

In contrast, EEC holds that the actual physical processes in body and in body-world interaction partly constitute whatever it is that we call 'the cognitive system' as a whole. Body, world and brain form a system. Together these system-parts 'cause' intelligent behaviour to arise as a system property. [[Dynamical Systems|Dynamical Systems Theory]] is a way of modeling behaviour that teams up quite naturally with the theoretical concepts of EEC.

Current discussions include:
* Is EEC really a (positive) theory of itself, or merely a bunch of complaints about what is wrong about (a too extreme version of) cognitivism? 
* Is EEC too 'descriptive', instead of really explaining anything about cognition?
* How can EEC explain [[natural language|linguistic]] processes and processes of explicit conscious [[reasoning]]?
* What would be the most informative empirical hypotheses, starting from an EEC perspective?
* Can we use traditional methods (stimulus-response paradigms) of [[experimental psychology]] to test EEC hypotheses?

==Theorists==

Theorists that inspired the EEC programme (but might not necessarily adhere to the above position) include:

'''Eukaryotic initiation factor 3''' ('''eIF3''') is a [[multiprotein complex]] that functions during the initiation phase of [[eukaryotic translation]].&lt;ref name="Aitken"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aitken|first1=Colin E.|last2=Lorsch|first2=Jon R.|title=A mechanistic overview of translation initiation in eukaryotes|journal=Nat.

In humans, eIF3 consists of 13 nonidentical subunits (eIF3a-m) with a combined molecular weight of ~800 kDa, making it the largest [[Eukaryotic initiation factor|translation initiation factor]].&lt;ref name="Hershey"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The role of eIF3 and its individual subunits in cancer|journal = Biochim.

== Function ==
eIF3 stimulates nearly all steps of translation initiation.&lt;ref name="Hinnebusch"/&gt;  eIF3 also appears to participate in other phases of translation, such as recycling, where it promotes the splitting of post-termination ribosomes.&lt;ref name=Pisarev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pisarev|first1=Andrey V.|last2=Hellen|first2=Christopher U.

== Interactions ==
eIF3 binds the [[Eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit (40S)|small ribosomal subunit (40S)]] at and near its solvent side and serves as a scaffold for several other initiation factors, the auxiliary factor [[DHX29]], and [[mRNA]]. eIF3 is a component of the multifactor complex (MFC) and [[43S preinitiation complex|43S]] and [[48S preinitiation complex|48S]] preinitiation complexes (PICs).&lt;ref name="Hinnebusch"/&gt; The interactions of eIF3 with other initiation factors can vary amongst species; for example, mammalian eIF3 directly interacts with the [[Eukaryotic initiation factor 4F|eIF4F]] complex (via [[eIF4G]]), while budding yeast lacks this connection.&lt;ref name="Hinnebusch"/&gt; However, both mammalian and yeast eIF3 independently bind [[eIF1]], [[eIF4B]], and [[eIF5]].&lt;ref name="Aitken"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Richard J.|last2=Hellen|first2=Christopher U.

Several subunits of eIF3 contain [[RNA recognition motif|RNA recognition motifs (RRMs)]] and other RNA binding domains to form a multisubunit RNA binding interface through which eIF3 interacts with cellular and viral [[Internal ribosome entry site|IRES]] mRNA, including the [[HCV IRES]].&lt;ref name="Hinnebusch"/&gt; eIF3 has also been shown to specifically bind [[N6-Methyladenosine|m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A]] modified RNA within [[Five prime untranslated region|5'UTRs]] to promote cap-independent translation.&lt;ref name=Meyer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Kate D.|last2=Patil|first2=Deepak P.|last3=Zhou|first3=Jun|last4=Zinoviev|first4=Alexandra|last5=Skabkin|first5=Maxim A.|last6=Elemento|first6=Olivier|last7=Pestova|first7=Tatyana V.|last8=Qiang|first8=Shu-Bing|last9=Jaffrey|first9=Samie R.|title=5' UTR m6A Promotes Cap-Independent Translation|journal=Cell|date=November 2015|volume=163|pages=999–1010|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.10.012|pmid=26593424|url=http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(15)01325-2|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All five core subunits of budding yeast's eIF3 are present in heat-induced [[stress granule]]s, along with several other translation factors.&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wallace|first1=Edward W.J.|last2=Kear-Scott|first2=Jamie L.|last3=Pilipenko|first3=Evgeny V.|last4=Schwartz|first4=Michael H.|last5=Laskowsk|first5=Pawel R.|last6=Rojek|first6=Alexander E.|last7=Katansk|first7=Christopher D.|last8=Riback|first8=Joshua A.|last9=Dion|first9=Michael F.|last10=Franks|first10=Alexander M.|authorlink11=Edoardo Airoldi|last11=Airoldi|first11=Edoardo M.|last12=Pan|first12=Tao|last13=Budnik|first13=Bogdan A.|last14=Drummond|first14=D.

== Signaling ==
eIF3 serves as a hub for cellular signaling through [[P70-S6 Kinase 1|S6K1]] and [[mTORC1|mTOR]]/[[RPTOR|Raptor]].&lt;ref name="Holz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holz|first1=Marina K.|last2=Ballif|first2=Bryan A.|last3=Gygi|first3=Steven P.|last4=Blenis|first4=John|title=mTOR and S6K1 Mediate Assembly of the Translation Preinitiation Complex through Dynamic Protein Interchange and Ordered Phosphorylation Events|journal=Cell|date=2005|volume=123|pages=569–580|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.10.024|pmid=16286006|url=http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(05)01157-8|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, eIF3 is bound by S6K1 in its inactive state, and activated mTOR/Raptor binds to eIF3 and phosphorylates S6K1 to promote its release from eIF3. Phosphorylated S6K1 is then free to phosphorylate a number of its own targets, including [[eIF4B]], thus serving as a mechanism of translational control.

== Disease ==
Individual subunits of eIF3 are overexpressed (a, b, c, h, i, and m) and underexpressed (e, f) in multiple human cancers.&lt;ref name="Hershey"/&gt; eIF3 has also been shown to bind a specific set of cell proliferation mRNAs and regulate their translation.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{Cite journal|title = eIF3 targets cell-proliferation messenger RNAs for translational activation or repression|journal = Nature|year = 2015|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v522/n7554/full/nature14267.html|issn = 0028-0836|pmid = 25849773 |pages = 111–114|volume = 522|doi=10.1038/nature14267|language = en|first = Amy S.Y.|last = Lee|first2 = Philip J.|last2 = Kranusch|first3 = Jamie H.D.|last3 = Cate|pmc=4603833}}&lt;/ref&gt; eIF3 also functions in the life cycles of a number of important human pathogens, including [[HIV]] and [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]]. In particular, the d-subunit of eIF3 is a substrate of [[HIV-1 protease|HIV protease]], and genetic knockdown of eIF3 subunits d, e, or f results in increased viral infectivity for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name="JägerCimermancic2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jäger|first1=Stefanie|last2=Cimermancic|first2=Peter|last3=Gulbahce|first3=Natali|last4=Johnson|first4=Jeffrey R.|last5=McGovern|first5=Kathryn E.|last6=Clarke|first6=Starlynn C.|last7=Shales|first7=Michael|last8=Mercenne|first8=Gaelle|last9=Pache|first9=Lars|last10=Li|first10=Kathy|last11=Hernandez|first11=Hilda|last12=Jang|first12=Gwendolyn M.|last13=Roth|first13=Shoshannah L.|last14=Akiva|first14=Eyal|last15=Marlett|first15=John|last16=Stephens|first16=Melanie|last17=D’Orso|first17=Ivan|last18=Fernandes|first18=Jason|last19=Fahey|first19=Marie|last20=Mahon|first20=Cathal|last21=O’Donoghue|first21=Anthony J.|last22=Todorovic|first22=Aleksandar|last23=Morris|first23=John H.|last24=Maltby|first24=David A.|last25=Alber|first25=Tom|last26=Cagney|first26=Gerard|last27=Bushman|first27=Frederic D.|last28=Young|first28=John A.|last29=Chanda|first29=Sumit K.|last30=Sundquist|first30=Wesley I.|last31=Kortemme|first31=Tanja|last32=Hernandez|first32=Ryan D.|last33=Craik|first33=Charles S.|last34=Burlingame|first34=Alma|last35=Sali|first35=Andrej|last36=Frankel|first36=Alan D.|last37=Krogan|first37=Nevan J.|title=Global landscape of HIV–human protein complexes|journal=Nature|year=2011|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature10719|pmid=22190034|pmc=3310911|volume=481|pages=365–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthroposophy}}
'''Eurythmy''' is an expressive [[performing art|movement art]] originated by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in conjunction with [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers|Marie von Sivers]] in the early 20th century. Primarily a performance art, it is also used in [[pedagogy|education]], especially in [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]], and&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; as part of [[anthroposophic medicine]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; for claimed therapeutic purposes.&lt;ref name=qw/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heusser/&gt;

The word ''eurythmy'' stems from Greek roots meaning ''beautiful'' or ''harmonious rhythm''.

==Movement repertoire==
The [[gesture]]s in the eurythmist's movement repertoire relate to the sounds and rhythms of speech, to the tones and rhythms of music and to "soul experiences", such as joy and sorrow. Once these fundamental repertoire elements are learned, they can be composed into free artistic expressions. The eurythmist also cultivates a feeling for the qualities of straight lines and curves, the directions of movement in space (forward, backward, up, down, left, right), contraction and expansion, and color. The element of color is also emphasized both through the costuming, usually given characteristic colors for a piece or part and formed of long, loose fabrics that accentuate the movements rather than the bodily form, and through the lighting, which saturates the space and changes with the moods of the piece.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;

Eurythmy's aim is to bring the artists' expressive movement and both the performers' and audience's feeling experience into harmony with a piece's content;&lt;ref name="Willmann"&gt;Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädogogik'', Böhlau Verlag, {{ISBN|3-412-01898-8}}, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; eurythmy is thus sometimes called "visible music" or "visible speech", expressions that originate with its founder, [[Rudolf Steiner]], who described eurythmy as an "art of the soul".

Most eurythmy today is performed to [[European classical music|classical (concert) music]] or texts such as [[poetry]] or stories. Silent pieces are also sometimes performed.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;

===Eurythmy with music===
When performing eurythmy with music (also called ''tone eurythmy''), the three major elements of music, [[melody]], [[harmony]] and [[rhythm]], are all expressed.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt;  The melody is primarily conveyed through expressing its rise and fall; the specific [[pitch (music)|pitches]]; and the [[interval (music)|intervallic qualities]] present.  Harmony is expressed through movement between tension and release, as expressions of dissonance and consonance, and between the more inwardly directed minor mood and the outwardly directed major mood.  Rhythm is chiefly conveyed through livelier and more contoured movements for quick notes, slower, dreamier movements for longer notes; in addition, longer tones move into the more passive (listening) back space, quicker tones into the more active front space.

Breaths or pauses are expressed through a larger or smaller movement in space, giving new impulse to what follows.  Beat is conveyed through greater emphasis of downbeats, or those beats upon which stress is normally placed.  Beat is generally treated as a subsidiary element. Eurythmy has only occasionally been done to popular music, in which beat plays a large role.

The timbre of individual instruments is brought into the quality both of the tonal gestures and of the whole movement of the eurythmist.  Usually there will be a different eurythmist or group of eurythmists expressing each instrument, for example in chamber or symphonic music.

A piece's [[choreography]] usually expresses elements such as the major or minor key, the shape of the melody line, the interplay between voices or instruments and the relative dominance of one or another voice or instrument.  Thus, musicians can often follow even the finest details of their part in the movements of the eurythmists on stage.  Particular musical forms (e.g. the [[sonata]]) can have special characteristic choreographic expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. McDermott, ''The Essential Steiner'', {{ISBN|0-06-065345-0}}, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eurythmy with spoken texts===
Eurythmy is often performed with spoken texts such as poetry, stories or plays. ''Speech eurythmy'' includes such elements as the [[phoneme|sounds of speech]], [[rhythm]]s, poetic [[meter (poetry)|meter]]s, [[grammar]] and mood. In speech eurythmy, all the sounds of language have characteristic gestural qualities: the sound of an 'A' is open due to the position of the articulators during the vowel. A 'k' sounds sharper due to the manner of articulation of the consonant, that it is a plosive. Note that it is the audible sounds themselves, not the letters of the written language, that are expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{npsn|date=April 2014}}[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Eurhythmy/19230826p01.html Steiner on eurythmy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Eurythmy was conceived in 1911 when a widow brought her young daughter, Lory Smits, who was interested in movement and dance, to the [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]] [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Due to the recent loss of her father, it was necessary for the girl to find a career. Steiner's advice was sought; he suggested that the girl begin working on a new art of movement. As preparation for this, she began to study human anatomy, to explore the human step,  to contemplate the movement implicit in Greek sculpture and dance, and to find movements that would express spoken sentences using the sounds of speech. Soon a number of other young people became interested in this form of expressive movement.

During these years, Steiner was writing a new drama each year for performance at the [[Anthroposophical Society]]'s summer gatherings; beginning in 1912, he began to incorporate the new art of movement into these dramas. When the Society decided to build an artistic center in [[Dornach]], [[Switzerland]] (this later became known as the [[Goetheanum]]) a small stage group began work and offered weekly performances of the developing art. [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], Steiner's wife, who was a trained actress and speech artist, was given responsibility for training and directing this ensemble. This first eurythmy ensemble went on tour in 1919, performing across [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Stott"&gt;Alan Stott, ''Eurythmy: its Birth and Development'', {{ISBN|0-9541048-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner saw eurythmy as a unique expression of the [[anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] impulse:
{{quote|It is the task of Anthroposophy to bring a greater depth, a wider vision and a more living spirit into the other forms of art. But the art of Eurythmy could only grow up out of the soul of Anthroposophy; could only receive its inspiration through a purely Anthroposophical conception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Eurhythmy/19230826p01.html Rudolf Steiner's "Lecture on Eurythmy" August 26, 1923]&lt;/ref&gt;|Rudolf Steiner}}

According to Steiner: ''In eurythmy we present in the form and movement of the human organism a direct external proof of a man's share in the life of the supersensible world. When people do eurythmy they are linked directly with the supersensible world. Whenever art is formed from a truly artistic conviction it bears witness to the connection of the human being with the supersensible world.'' (Dornach, 12 September 1920) &lt;ref&gt;Biesantz/Klingborg, The Goetheanum: Rudolf Steiner's Architectural Impulse (London, 1979), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Steiner gave two intensive workshops on different aspects of eurythmy; transcripts of his talks during these workshops are published as ''Eurythmy as Visible Speech'' and ''Eurythmy as Visible Singing''.

Eurythmy ensembles in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] and at the Goetheanum soon became established parts of the cultural life of Europe. The Goetheanum ensemble was recognized with a gold medal at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|Paris Expo]] of 1937/8. The Stuttgart training and ensemble, led by [[Else Klink]], had to close in the [[Nazism|Nazi]] period but reopened shortly after the close of [[World War II]]. There are now training centers and artistic ensembles in many countries.&lt;ref name="Stott"/&gt;

===Etymology===
The word ''eurythmy'' stems from Greek roots meaning ''beautiful'' or ''harmonious rhythm''. The term was used by Ancient Greek and Roman architects to refer to the harmonious proportions of a design or building;&lt;ref&gt;Matila Ghyka, ''The Geometry of Art and Life'', Sheen and Ward, NY 1946, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The English word ''eurythmy'' was used from the 17th to 19th century to refer not only to harmonious architectural proportions, but also to "rhythmical order or movement" and "a graceful proportion and carriage of the body".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/65086 "Eurhythmy"], Oxford English Dictionary, accessed 1/14/14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eurythmy as a performing art==
There are notable eurythmy ensembles in [[Dornach]], [[Switzerland]]; [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]; [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]]; [[London]], [[England]]; [[Järna]], [[Sweden]], and [[Chestnut Ridge, New York]] (near [[New York City]]). All of these groups both perform locally and tour internationally. Many smaller performing groups also exist [http://www.eurythmie-info.de/Buehnen.htm (see list)]. High schools that have their own performing ensembles include the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120313232919/http://www.sfwaldorf.org/high-school/arts/eurythmy-troupe San Francisco Waldorf High School ensemble].

==Pedagogical eurythmy==
When the first [[Waldorf School]] was founded in 1919, eurythmy was included in the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Stockmeyer, ''Rudolf Steiner's Curriculum for Waldorf Schools'', Steiner Schools Fellowship, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; It was quickly recognized as a successful complement to [[gymnastics]] in the school's movement program and is now taught in most Waldorf schools, as well as in many non-Waldorf pre-school centers, kindergartens and schools. It is taught to all ages from pre-schools through high school and into college. Its purpose is to awaken and strengthen the expressive capacities of children through movement, stimulating the child to bring [[imagination]], [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]] and [[concept]]ualization to the point where they can manifest these as "vital, moving forms" in physical space.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; It is also thought to improve balance, coordination, concentration, rhythm, and form an awareness of patterns.

Eurythmy pedagogical exercises begin with the straight line and curve and proceed through successively more complicated geometric figures and choreographed forms, developing a child's coordination and concentration. An extensive set of special exercises has also been developed for pedagogical purposes.&lt;ref name="Willmann"/&gt; These include metamorphosing geometric patterns and dynamic movement sequences.

Rods or balls are sometimes used in exercises to develop precision in movement, to expand the experience of space, develop precise balance, and to objectify the movement experience. The rods are usually approximately the length of an arm; the balls are of a size to fit comfortably in one hand. Both are generally made of copper, a material receptive to warmth.

Though there are some independent post-graduate trainings for pedagogical eurythmy, this aspect is frequently included in courses focusing on artistic work.

According to the precepts of anthroposophic medicine, a human has four aspects which need to be treated: spirit, soul, life and matter.&lt;ref name=Heusser/&gt; Eurythmy is one of the practices said to act on the "life" aspect, and is claimed to effect an "improvement of health related life functions".&lt;ref name=Heusser/&gt; A person receiving eurthymy therapy moves under the guidance of a eurythmy therapist, who will have been trained two years beyond the four-year fundamental course in eurythmy. The movements may be adapted to the condition of the person being treated; for example, they may be done while either sitting or even lying down.&lt;ref name="KO"&gt;{{cite book | title=Komplementäre Onkologie: supportive Maßnahmen und evidenzbasierte Empfehlungen | publisher=Schattauer Verlag | author=Hübner, Jutta | year=2008 | pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therapeutic eurythmy is claimed to bring about a "re-integration of body, soul, and spirit."&lt;ref name=Heusser&gt;{{cite book | title=Integrative Oncology | publisher=Oxford University Press | last1=Heusser|first1= Peter |last2=Kienle |first2=Gunver Sophia| chapter=Anthroposophic medicine, integrative oncology, and mistletoe therapy of cancer |editor-last1=Abrams|editor-last2=Weil|editor2-first=Andrew |editor2-link=Andrew Weil |editor1-first=Donald |year=2009 |series=Weil Integrative Medicine Library |page=327 |isbn=978-0-19-988585-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0D-WlrrV520C&amp;pg=PT251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 review in ''BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine'' said that eurythmy was a "potentially relevant add-on" to a therapeutic program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Büssing A, Ostermann T, Majorek M, Matthiessen PF |title=Eurythmy Therapy in clinical studies: a systematic literature review |journal=BMC Complement Altern Med |volume=8 |issue= |pages=8 |year=2008 |pmid=18377647 |pmc=2322948 |doi=10.1186/1472-6882-8-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but though the studies reviewed reported improvement in symptoms, limitations in the underlying data and in the review methods means these conclusions "warrant cautious interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |entry=Eurythmy Therapy in clinical studies: a systematic literature review |publisher=[[Centre for Reviews and Dissemination]] |date=7 April 2009 |url=http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/CRDWeb/ShowRecord.asp?AccessionNumber=12008103765#.U0Yu14XePN0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fan''' is a powered [[machine]] used to create flow within a [[fluid]], typically a [[gas]] such as [[air]].
A fan consists of a rotating arrangement of vanes or blades which act on the air. The rotating assembly of blades and hub is known as an impeller, a rotor, or a runner. Usually, it is contained within some form of housing or case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/201417/fan|title=Fan|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may direct the airflow or increase safety by preventing objects from contacting the fan blades. Most fans are powered by [[electricity|electric]] motors, but other sources of power may be used, including [[hydraulic motor]]s, [[handcrank]]s, [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion engines]], and [[Solar power|solar power]].

Mechanically, a fan can be any revolving [[wikt:vane#English|vane]] or vanes used for producing [[air current|currents of air]]. Fans produce air flows with high [[volume]] and low [[pressure]] (although higher than [[ambient pressure]]), as opposed to [[gas compressor|compressors]] which produce high pressures at a comparatively low volume. A fan [[blade]] will often rotate when exposed to an air fluid stream, and devices that take advantage of this, such as [[anemometer]]s and [[wind turbine]]s, often have designs similar to that of a fan.
{{details|centrifugal compressor}}
Typical applications include [[HVAC#Ventilation|climate control]] and personal [[thermal comfort]] (e.g., an electric table or floor fan), vehicle engine cooling systems (e.g., in front of a [[radiator]]), machinery cooling systems (e.g., inside computers and [[audio power amplifier]]s), ventilation, fume extraction, [[winnowing]] (e.g., separating chaff of [[cereal]] grains), removing [[dust]] (e.g. [[sucking]] as in a [[vacuum cleaner]]), drying (usually in combination with a heat source) and to provide draft for a [[fire]].

While fans are often used to cool people, they do not actually cool air (if anything, electric fans warm it slightly due to the warming of their motors), but work by [[evaporative cooling]] of [[sweat]] and increased heat [[convection]] into the surrounding air due to the airflow from the fans. Thus, fans may become ineffective at cooling the body if the surrounding air is near body temperature and contains high humidity. {{citation needed span|text=During periods of very high heat and humidity, governments actually advise against the use of fans.|date=July 2018}}

== History ==
The [[punkah]] fan was used in [[India]] about 500 BCE. It was a handheld fan made from bamboo strips or other plant fibre, that could be rotated or fanned to move air. During [[British India|British rule]], the word came to be used by Anglo-Indians to mean a large swinging flat fan, fixed to the ceiling, and pulled by a servant, called the [[punkawallah]].
[[File:Patent, Mechanical Fan, 1830.png|thumb|left|225px|[[Patent drawing]] for a ''Fan Moved by Mechanism'', 27 November 1830]]

For purposes of [[air conditioning]], the Han Dynasty craftsman and engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 CE) invented a manually operated rotary fan with seven wheels that measured 3&amp;nbsp;m (10&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the Chinese applied [[Hydraulics|hydraulic power]] to rotate the fan wheels for air conditioning, while the rotary fan became even more common during the Song Dynasty (960–1279).&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 99, 134, 151, 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Day &amp; McNeil (1996), 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, the experiments of scientists including [[Otto von Guericke]], [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Robert Boyle]], established the basic principles of vacuum and airflow. The English architect Sir [[Christopher Wren]] applied an early ventilation system in the [[Houses of Parliament]] that used bellows to circulate air. Wren's design would be the catalyst for much later improvement and innovation. The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, as illustrated by [[Georg Agricola]] (1494–1555).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 154"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Theophilus Desaguliers]], a British engineer, demonstrated a successful use of a fan system to draw out stagnant air from coal mines in 1727 and soon afterwards he installed a similar apparatus in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanmakers.com/text.aspx?id=26 |title=A Short History of Mechanical Fans |publisher=The Worshipful Company of Fan Makers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204080959/http://www.fanmakers.com/text.aspx?id=26 |archivedate=December 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Good ventilation was particularly important in coal mines to reduce casualties from asphyxiation. The civil engineer [[John Smeaton]], and later [[John Buddle]] installed reciprocating air pumps in the mines in the North of [[England]]. However, this arrangement was not ideal as the machinery was liable to breaking down.

=== Steam ===
With the advent of practical [[steam power]], fans could finally be used for ventilation. In 1837 William Fourness of England installed a steam-driven fan at [[Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AHp8K45uCmwC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=Fourness+Steam+Fan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZwLjft83QAhUHAsAKHc9SDc4Q6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Fourness%20Steam%20Fan&amp;f=false Collieries of Wales: Engineering and Architecture], By Stephen R. Hughes, Page 97&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849 a 6&amp;nbsp;m radius steam driven fan, designed by [[William Brunton]], was made operational in the Gelly Gaer [[Colliery]] of [[South Wales]]. The model was exhibited at the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851. Also in 1851 [[David Boswell Reid]], a Scottish doctor, installed four steam powered fans in the ceiling of [[St George's Hospital]] in [[Liverpool]], so that the pressure produced by the fans would force the incoming air upward and through vents in the ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic753413.files/8_Engineers%20Contractors%20and%20Industrial%20Construction/Bruegmann_Central.pdf|title=Central Heating and Ventilation:Origins and Effects on Architectural Design|author=Robert Bruegmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://content.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/heating-ventilation/heatingventilation.pdf/ HISTORIC BUILDING ENGINEERING SYSTEMS &amp; EQUIPMENT HEATING &amp; VENTILATION], By Brian Roberts, CIBSE Heritage Group&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in the technology were made by [[James Nasmyth]], Frenchman Theophile Guibal and J. R. Waddle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x-pL19ro-qsC|title=Fans and Ventilation: A practical guide|author=Cory, William|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080531588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrical ===
Between 1882 and 1886 [[Schuyler Wheeler]] invented a fan powered by electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B. A. C. (Before Air Conditioning)|publisher=New Orleans Bar Association|url=http://www.neworleansbar.org/documents/BeforeA.C.8-5_000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was commercially marketed by the American firm Crocker &amp; Curtis electric motor company. In 1882, [[Philip Diehl (inventor)|Philip Diehl]] developed the world's first electric [[ceiling fan]].  During this intense period of innovation, fans powered by alcohol, oil, or kerosene were common around the turn of the 20th century.
In 1909, [[KDK]] of Japan pioneered the invention of mass-produced electric fans for home use. In the 1920s, industrial advances allowed steel fans to be mass-produced in different shapes, bringing fan prices down and allowing more homeowners to afford them. In the 1930s, the first art deco fan (the "swan fan") was designed. By the 1940s, [[Crompton Greaves]] of India became the world's largest manufacturer of electric ceiling fans mainly for sale in India, Asia and the Middle East. By the 1950s, table and stand fans were manufactured in colors that were bright and eye catching.

Window and central [[air conditioning]] in the 1960s caused many companies to discontinue production of fans.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Fans"&gt;[http://www.fancollectors.org/fanhistory.htm Fancollectors.org – A Brief History of Fans] Information Provided by Steve Cunningham – retrieved July 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; But in the mid 1970s, with an increasing awareness of the cost of electricity and the amount of energy used to heat and cool homes, turn-of-the-century styled ceiling fans became immensely popular again as both decorative and energy efficient units.

In 1998, Walter K. Boyd invented the [[High-volume low-speed fan|HVLS ceiling fan]]. A lifelong inventor, Boyd was charged with developing a system to cool dairy cattle. Dairy cattle, when overheated, decrease milk production. Using the laws of physics and airflow, Boyd developed a slow moving fan that incorporated 10 aluminum blades and was 8-feet diameter. Unlike traditional ceiling fans that move quickly, this large fan moved slowly. Due to its diameter size, the fan moved a large column of air down and out 360 degrees and continuously mixed fresh air with the stale air inside the barn. They are used in many industrial and agricultural settings, because of their energy efficiency. It also cooled the inside of the barn without causing the dairy cattle undue stress or kicking up dust.

After much testing, Boyd discovered HVLS fan technology to be energy efficient as it costs less to run one HVLS fan than it did to run 50 small high-speed fans. Due to the skyrocketing costs of energy, HVLS commercial ceiling fans are used today to supplement HVAC systems in industrial and commercial settings, including warehouses, manufacturing facilities and malls, as HVLS fans help lower heating and cooling costs.&lt;ref name="Industrial Fan Designer Finds Niche in Energy Efficiency"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101227180929/http://www.designnews.com/blog/Automation_and_Control/40243-Industrial_Fan_Designer_Finds_Niche_in_Energy_Efficiency.php Industrial Fan Designer Finds Niche in Energy Efficiency – Automation and Control], By David Greenfield, December 20, 2010, Blog on Design News,  Information provided by Dianna Huff – retrieved May 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
[[File:Two box fans.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Two c. 1980 box fans]]
[[File:Ceiling fan with lamp.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ceiling fan with a lamp.]]
Mechanical revolving blade fans are made in a wide range of designs. They are used on the floor, table, desk, or hung from the ceiling (ceiling fan). They can also be built into a [[Window fan|window]], wall, roof, chimney, etc. Most electronic systems such as [[computer]]s include fans to cool the circuits inside, and in appliances such as hair dryers and portable space heaters and mounted/installed wall heaters. They are also used for moving air in air-conditioning systems, and in automotive engines, where they are driven by belts or by direct motor. Fans used for comfort create a [[wind chill]] by increasing the [[heat transfer coefficient]], but do not lower temperatures directly. Fans used to cool electrical equipment or in engines or other machines do cool the equipment directly by forcing hot air into the cooler environment outside of the machine.

There are three main types of fans used for moving air, ''axial'', ''centrifugal'' (also called ''radial'') and ''cross flow'' (also called ''tangential''). [[ASME|The American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] Performance Testing Code 11 (PTC)&lt;ref name="PTC 11 – Fans"&gt;[https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/ptc-11-2008-fans ASME PTC 11 – Fans].&lt;/ref&gt; provides standard procedures for conducting and reporting tests on fans, including those of the centrifugal, axial, and mixed flows.

=== Axial-flow ===
[[File:Luefter y.s.tech pd1270153b-2f.jpg|thumb|right|upright|An axial box fan for cooling electrical equipment.]]
Axial-flow fans have blades that force air to move [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the shaft about which the blades rotate. This type of fan is used in a wide variety of applications, ranging from small cooling fans for electronics to the giant fans used in [[wind tunnel]]s. Axial flow fans are applied in air conditioning and industrial process applications. Standard axial flow fans have diameters from 300–400&amp;nbsp;mm or 1800 to 2000&amp;nbsp;mm and work under pressures up to 800 Pa. Special types of fans are used as low pressure compressor stages in aircraft engines.
Examples of axial fans are:
* Table fan: Basic elements of a typical table fan include the fan blade, base, armature and lead [[wire]]s, motor, blade [[safety barrier|guard]], motor housing, [[oscillator]] gearbox, and oscillator shaft. The oscillator is a mechanism that motions the fan from side to side. The armature axle shaft comes out on both ends of the motor, one end of the shaft is attached to the blade and the other is attached to the oscillator gearbox. The motor case joins to the gearbox to contain the rotor and stator. The oscillator shaft combines to the weighted base and the gearbox. A motor housing covers the oscillator mechanism. The blade guard joins to the motor case for safety.
[[File:Ceiling fan with light.png|thumb|right|200px|A [[Ceiling fan]] is an example of an axial fan.]]
*Domestic Extractor Fan: Wall or ceiling mounted, the domestic extractor fan is employed to remove moisture and stale air from domestic dwellings. Bathroom extractor fans typically utilize a four inch (100mm) impeller, whilst kitchen extractor fans typically use a six inch (150mm) impeller as the room itself is often bigger. Axial fans with 125mm impellers are also used in larger bathrooms though are much less common. Domestic axial extractor fans are not suitable for duct runs over 3m or 4m, depending on the number of bends in the run, as the increased air pressure in longer pipework inhibits the performance of the fan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.extractorfanworld.co.uk/choosing-a-bathroom-extractor-fan-123-c.asp|title=Choosing a Bathroom Extractor Fan|last=|first=|date=10 July 2018|website=Extarctor Fan World|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Electro-mechanical fans: Among collectors, are rated according to their condition, size, age, and number of blades. Four-blade designs are the most common. Five-blade or six-blade designs are rare. The materials from which the components are made, such as brass, are important factors in fan desirability.
*[[Ceiling fan]]: A fan suspended from the ceiling of a room is a ceiling fan. Most ceiling fans rotate at relatively low speeds and do not have blade guards. Ceiling fans can be found in both residential and industrial/commercial settings.
* In [[automobile]]s, a mechanical fan provides [[engine cooling]] and prevents the engine from overheating by blowing or drawing air through a [[coolant]]-filled [[radiator]]. The fan may be driven with a [[pulley#Belt and pulley systems|belt and pulley]] off the [[internal-combustion engine|engine]]'s [[crankshaft]] or an electric motor switched on or off by a [[thermostat]]ic [[switch]].
* [[Computer fan|Computer cooling fan]] for cooling electrical components
* Fans inside [[audio power amplifier]]s help to draw heat away from the electrical components.
* [[Variable pitch fan|variable-pitch fan]]: A variable-pitch fan is used where precise control of static pressure within supply ducts is required. The blades are arranged to rotate upon a control-pitch hub. The fan wheel will spin at a constant  speed. The blades follow the control pitch hub. As the hub moves toward the rotor, the blades increase their angle of attack and an increase in flow results.

=== Centrifugal ===
{{Main|centrifugal fan}}
[[File:CentrifugalFan.png|thumb|right|upright|Typical centrifugal fan.]]
[[File:Centrifugal fan.png|thumb|left|200px|A diagram of a centrifugal fan, with top view to show airflow.]]
Often called a "squirrel cage" (because of its general similarity in appearance to [[Hamster wheel|exercise wheels]] for pet rodents) or "scroll fan", the centrifugal fan has a moving component (called an [[impeller]]) that consists of a central shaft about which a set of blades form a [[spiral]], or ribs, are positioned. Centrifugal fans blow air at right angles to the intake of the fan, and spin the air outwards to the outlet (by deflection and [[centrifugal force]]). The impeller rotates, causing air to enter the fan near the shaft and move [[perpendicular]]ly from the shaft to the opening in the scroll-shaped fan casing. A centrifugal fan produces more pressure for a given air volume, and is used where this is desirable such as in [[leaf blower]]s, [[blowdryer]]s, air mattress inflators, [[inflatable structure]]s, [[climate control]], and various industrial purposes. They are typically quieter than comparable axial fans.

=== Cross-flow fan ===
[[File:Cross-flow fan schematic patent.png|thumb|Cross-section of cross-flow fan, from the 1893 patent. The rotation is clock-wise. The stream guide ''F'' is usually not present in modern implementations.]]
[[File:Tangential-flow-coloured-labels.png|thumb|right|upright|Cross-flow fan]]
The ''cross-flow'' or ''tangential'' fan, sometimes known as a ''tubular'' fan, was patented in 1893 by Paul Mortier,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mortier. ''Fan or Blowing apparatus''. [https://www.google.com/patents/US507445 US Pat. No. 507,445]&lt;/ref&gt; and is used extensively in the [[HVAC]] industry. The fan is usually long in relation to the diameter, so the flow approximately remains two-dimensional away from the ends. The CFF uses an impeller with forward curved blades, placed in a housing consisting of a rear wall and vortex wall. Unlike radial machines, the main flow moves transversely across the impeller, passing the blading twice.

The flow within a cross-flow fan may be broken up into three distinct regions: a vortex region near the fan discharge, called an eccentric vortex, the through-flow region, and a paddling region directly opposite. Both the vortex and paddling regions are dissipative, and as a result, only a portion of the impeller imparts usable work on the flow. The cross-flow fan, or transverse fan, is thus a two-stage partial admission machine. The popularity of the crossflow fan in the HVAC industry comes from its compactness, shape, quiet operation, and ability to provide high pressure coefficient. Effectively a rectangular fan in terms of inlet and outlet geometry, the diameter readily scales to fit the available space, and the length is adjustable to meet flow rate requirements for the particular application.

Common household tower fans are also cross-flow fans. Much of the early work focused on developing the cross-flow fan for both high and low-flow-rate conditions, and resulted in numerous patents. Key contributions were made by Coester, Ilberg and Sadeh, Porter and Markland, and Eck. One interesting phenomenon particular to the cross-flow fan is that, as the blades rotate, the local air incidence angle changes. The result is that in certain positions the blades act as compressors (pressure increase), while at other azimuthal locations the blades act as [[turbine]]s (pressure decrease).

Since the flow both enters and exits the impeller radially, the crossflow fan is well suited for aircraft applications. Due to the 2D nature of the flow, the fan readily integrates into a wing for use in both thrust production and boundary-layer control. A configuration that utilizes a crossflow fan is located at the wing [[leading edge]] is the [[fanwing]]. This design creates lift by deflecting the wake downward due to the rotational direction of the fan, causing large Magnus force, similar to a spinning leading-edge cylinder. Another configuration utilizing a crossflow fan for thrust and flow control is the propulsive wing. In this design, the crossflow fan is placed near the [[trailing edge]] of a thick wing, and draws the air off the wing's suction (top) surface. By doing this, the propulsive wing is nearly stall-free, even at extremely high angles of attack, producing very high lift. The external links section provides links to these concepts.

A cross flow fan, is a centrifugal fan in which the air flows through the fan, rather than through an inlet. The rotor of a cross flow fan is covered to create a pressure differential. When used in household fans, cross flow fans have smaller opening on one side and a larger opening on the other. Cross flow fans have openings of different sizes on the front and rear sides. The resultant pressure difference allows air to flow straight through the fan, even though the fan blades counter the flow of air on one side of the rotation. Cross flow fans give airflow along the entire width of the fan, however, they are noiser than ordinary centrifugal fans presumedly because the fan blades fight the flow of air on one side of the rotation unlike normal squirrel cage fans. Cross flow fans are often used in [[air conditioner]]s, automobile ventilation systems, and for cooling in medium-sized equipment such as [[photocopier]]s.

The action of a fan or blower causes pressures slightly above atmospheric, which are called [[Plenum chamber|plenum]]s.

== Bladeless Indirect viscous-shear fan ==
{{Cleanup-jargon|section|date=December 2010}}
This is an indirect blower system which collects pressurized airflow from a standard blower device that can be of any type mentioned in this article, and directs the collected airflow through a hollow tube or toroid, blowing a thin high-velocity laminar airflow from holes or a continuous slot across the surface of the tube or toroid. These fans have a 3-dimensional mixed-flow impeller in a lower compartment. Air is drawn in and compressed, before being expelled  through an annulus, and accelerated over an airfoil lamp. Inducing and entraining ambient air through viscous shearing, the loop-shaped upper section multiplies the total airflow many times. The high velocity laminar airflow tends to drag ambient air along with it, due to [[viscous shear]]. Only around 7% of the total airflow actually passes through the fan itself.

== Uncommon types of fans ==

=== Bellows ===
{{Main|Bellows}}
[[File:Bellows (PSF).svg|thumb|Diagram of a single-acting hand bellows]]
[[Bellows]] are also used to move air, although not generally considered fans. A hand-operated bellows is essentially a bag with a nozzle and handles, which can be filled with air by one movement, and the air expelled by another. Typically it would comprise two rigid flat surfaces hinged at one end, where a nozzle is fitted, and with handles at the other.

The sides of the surfaces are joined by a flexible and air-proof material such as leather; the surfaces and joining material comprise a bag sealed everywhere but at the nozzle. (The joining material typically has a characteristic pleated construction that is so common that similar expanding fabric arrangements not used for moving air, such as on a [[folding camera]], are called [[Bellows (photography)|bellows]].) Separating the handles expands the bag, which fills with air; squeezing them together expels the air. A simple [[valve]] (e.g., a flap) may be fitted so that air enters without having to come from the nozzle, which may be close to a fire.

Bellows produce a directed pressurized stream of air; the airflow volume is typically low with moderate pressure. They are an older technology, used mainly to produce a strong and directed airflow unlike non-electric bladed mechanical fans, before the introduction of electricity.
* A single-acting bellows will only produce airflow during the exhaust stroke.
* A double-acting bellows is a pair of bellows capable of blowing out air from one while inhaling air into the other, but airflow still temporarily ceases when the stroke direction is reversed.
* Combining multiple bellows at third-cycle or quarter-cycle arrangements on a crank arm allows for nearly continuous airflow from several bellows at once; each is in a different phase of inhaling and exhausting during the cycle.

=== Coandă effect ===
[[File:XinHui 新會碧桂園 Country Garden 大潤發 RT-Mart Fresh Food 01.JPG|thumb|An open-face supermarket freezer with an air curtain. Cooling air circulates across the food through the dark slot seen at the rear of the freezer, and through another grille not visible along the front.]]
The [[Dyson Air Multiplier]] fans, and the Imperial C2000 series range hood fans, have no exposed fan blades or other visibly moving parts except their oscillating and tilting head. The airflow is generated using the [[Coandă effect]]; a small quantity of air from a high-pressure-bladed impeller fan, contained in the base rather than exposed, drives a large airmass via a low-pressure area created by the [[airfoil]].&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6377644/Dyson-fan-was-it-invented-30-years-ago.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Harry | last=Wallop | title=Dyson fan: was it invented 30 years ago? | date=20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/5379890/dyson-air-multiplier-review-making-a-300-fan-takes-cojones Dyson Air Multiplier Review: Making a $300 Fan Takes Cojones]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/10/12/video-review-the-dyson-air-multiplier/ Video Review: The Dyson Air Multiplier], Posted Oct 12, 2009, by John Biggs, TechCrunch&lt;/ref&gt;  The US Patent &amp; Trademark Office initially ruled that Dyson's patent was not an improvement on the [[Toshiba]] patent on a nearly identical bladeless desktop fan granted in 1981.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk" /&gt;
[[Air door|Air curtains and air doors]] also utilize this effect to help retain warm or cool air within an otherwise exposed area that lacks a cover or door. Air curtains are commonly used on open-face dairy, freezer, and vegetable displays to help retain chilled air within the cabinet using a laminar airflow circulated across the display opening. The airflow is typically generated by a mechanical fan of any type described in this article hidden in the base of the display cabinet.

=== Convective ===
Differences in air temperature will affect the density of air and can be used to induce air circulation through the mere act of heating or cooling an air mass. This effect is so subtle and works at such low air pressures that it does not appear to fit the definition of a fan technology. However, prior to the development of electricity, convective airflow was the primary method of inducing airflow in living spaces.
Old fashioned oil and coal furnaces were not electric and operated simply on the principle of convection to move the warm air. Very large volume air ducts were sloped upwards away from the top of the furnace towards floor and wall registers above the furnace. Cool air was returned through similar large ducts leading to the bottom of the furnace.
Older houses from before electrification often had open duct grilles leading from the ceiling of a lower level to the floor of an upper level, to allow convective airflow to slowly rise up the building from one floor to the next.
[[Outhouse]]s commonly rely on a simple enclosed air channel in a corner of the structure to exhaust offensive odors. Exposed to sunlight, the channel is warmed and a slow convective air current is vented out the top of the building, while fresh air enters the pit through the seat hole.

=== Electrostatic ===
An [[electrostatic fluid accelerator]] propels airflow by inducing motion in airborne charged particles.  A high voltage electric field (commonly 25,000 to 50,000 volts) formed between exposed charged [[anode]] and [[cathode]] surfaces is capable of inducing airflow through a principle referred to as [[ionic wind]]. The airflow pressure is typically very low but the air volume can be large. However, a sufficiently high voltage potential can also cause the formation of [[ozone]] and [[nitrogen oxides]], which are reactive and irritating to [[mucous membrane]]s.

== Noise ==
Fans generate noise from the rapid flow of air around blades and obstacles, and sometimes from the motor. Fan noise has been found to be roughly proportional to the fifth power of fan speed; halving speed reduces noise by about 15 [[Decibel#Acoustics|dB]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/top10noise.pdf UK Health and Safetey Executive: Top 10 noise control techniques]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fan motor drive methods ==
[[File:UMA 2.JPG|thumb|Building heating and cooling systems commonly use a squirrel cage fan driven by belt from a separate electric motor.]]
[[File:1989 Toyota 1HD-T Type engine front.jpg|thumb|[[Internal combustion engine]]s sometimes drive an engine cooling fan directly, or may use a separate electric motor.]]
[[File:Silniki by Zureks.jpg|thumb|Large electric motors may have a cooling fan either on the back or inside the case. (Shown with black rear cover removed.)]]
[[File:Air conditioning unit-en.svg|thumb|Dual shaft fan motor in a window air conditioner.]]
Standalone fans are usually powered by an [[electric motor]]s, often attached directly to the motor's output, with no gears or belts. The motor is either hidden in the fan's center hub or extends behind it. For big industrial fans, three-phase asynchronous motors are commonly used, placed near the fan and driving it through a [[Pulley#Belt and pulley systems|belt and pulleys]]. Smaller fans are often powered by [[Shaded-pole motor|shaded pole AC motors]], or [[Brushed DC Electric Motor|brushed]] or [[Brushless DC electric motor|brushless DC motors]]. AC-powered fans usually use mains voltage, while DC-powered fans use low voltage, typically 24V, 12V, or 5 V. Cooling fans for computer equipment always use brushless DC motors, which generate much less [[electromagnetic interference]] than other types.

In machines with a rotating part, the fan is often connected to it rather than being powered separately. This is commonly seen in motor vehicles with [[internal combustion engine]]s, large cooling systems, locomotives, and winnowing machines, where the fan is connected to the [[drive shaft]] or through a belt and pulleys. Another common configuration is a dual-shaft motor, where one end of the shaft drives a mechanism, while the other has a fan mounted on it to cool the motor itself. Window [[air conditioner]]s commonly use a dual-shaft fan to operate separate blowers for the interior and exterior parts of the device.

Where electrical power or rotating parts are not readily available, fans may be driven by other methods. High-pressure gases such as steam can be used to drive a small [[turbine]], and high-pressure liquids can be used to drive a [[pelton wheel]], either which can provide the rotational drive for a fan. 

Large, slow-moving energy sources such as a flowing river can also power a fan using a [[water wheel]] and a series of step-down gears or pulleys to increase the rotational speed to that which is required for efficient fan operation.

== Solar powered fan ==
Electric fans used for ventilation may be powered by [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s instead of mains current. This is an attractive option because once the capital costs of the solar panel have been covered, the resulting electricity is free. In addition, electricity is always available when the sun is shining and the fan needs to run.

A typical example uses a detached 10-[[watt]], 12x12 [[inch]] (30x30 [[metre|cm]]) solar panel and is supplied with appropriate brackets, [[Power cable|cables]], and [[Electrical connector|connector]]s. It can be used to ventilate up to 1,250 [[square feet]] (100 m2) of [[area]] and can move air at up to 800 [[cubic feet]] per minute (400 L/s). Because of the wide availability of 12 V [[brushless DC electric motor]]s and the convenience of wiring such a low voltage, such fans usually operate on 12 [[volt]]s.

The detached solar panel is typically installed in the spot which gets most of the sun light and then connected to the fan mounted as far as 20 to 25 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (6 to 7 m) away. Other permanently-mounted and small portable fans include an integrated (non-detachable) solar panel.

The '''Forest Products Research Laboratory''' was a research institute in [[Buckinghamshire]].

==History==
It was founded by the Forest Products Research Board, established in 1923, overseen by the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (itself created in 1915). The Forest Products Research Board was mainly interested in the economic value of [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical forests]] in the [[British Empire]].

The Forestry Conference had been held in 1923. An Empire Forestry Conference had been held earlier in 1920. There was an Empire Forestry Association. The Forest Products Research Laboratories were set up initially at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] in north-east [[Hampshire]] in 1925. In 1927, a new site was built at Princes Risborough. The site cost £80,000, and was officially opened on 31 July 1928. The first Director was Sir Ralph Pearson, who stayed until 1933. The site was conducting research into the [[Lyctus (beetle)]], a pest, and [[dry rot]], caused by [[Wood-decay fungus|fungi]].

Around the same time, the [[Imperial Forestry Institute]] (now part of the [[Department of Plant Sciences, University of Oxford]]) was established in [[Oxford]]. It was considered about setting up an Empire Forestry Bureau, to disseminate information about forestry research around the Empire. Also in Buckinghamshire was the [[Parasite Laboratory]], part of the [[Imperial Bureau of Entomology]] in London, later the Commonwealth Institute of Entomology&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBER%2FBER74_04%2FS0007485300013900a.pdf&amp;code=47fbb0c009e8e524417e3dfa463249ff Bulletin of Entomological Research 1984]&lt;/ref&gt; which produced the [[Bulletin of Entomological Research]], and is now represented by [[CABI (organisation)|CABI]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. From February to April 1928, an Empire Timber Exhibition was held at the [[Commonwealth Institute|Imperial Institute]] (now the site of [[Imperial College London]]). The Parasite Laboratory closed in 1940.

In 1928 research was carried out across the UK into [[Dutch elm disease]]. In 1931 it carried out work into the [[Deathwatch beetle]]; the first investigation into this pest had been by [[Harold Maxwell-Lefroy]] at Imperial College in 1914.

The [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] visited the site on 30 April 1952. The Director from 1945-60 was Prof Frank Henderson.

In August 1958, it was decided by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research that the government could not continue funding into the forestry products research, and that the timber industry should pay for it themselves, with funding being withdrawn from around 1963. The Forest Products Research Board closed in 1958, with some research passing to the [[Timber Development Association]] (now called TRADA). From 1960-62 the Director was Sir [[Alcon Copisarow]], who became the Chief Scientific Officer from 1962-64 at the Ministry of Technology. From the 1960s, the site was run under the Ministry of Technology.

===Absorption===
On 1 January 1971, the site was transferred to be overseen by the Department of the Environment. Even greater changes occurred in 1972, when it was absorbed into the [[Building Research Establishment|BRE]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bre.co.uk/history BRE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestry.oxfordjournals.org/content/70/4/337.full.pdf Seventy years of forest products research]&lt;/ref&gt;

The site at Princes Risborough continued with work into timber research until 1988, being known as Princes Risborougb Laboratory.

==Structure==
It was sited in [[Princes Risborough]] in [[Wycombe District]]. It was run by the [[Department of the Environment (United Kingdom)|Department of the Environment]].

==Function==
It conducted extensive and widespread research into the strength of wood and timber, and decay of wood.

The expression '''fortepiano''' (sometimes called '''forte piano''') is a sudden [[Dynamics (music)|dynamic]] change used in a [[Sheet music|musical score]], usually with the abbreviation {{serif|'''''fp'''''}}, to designate a section of music in which the music should be played loudly (''forte''), then immediately softly (''piano'').&lt;ref&gt;Collins Encyclopedia of Music {{ISBN|0-907486-50-9}} Page 217&lt;/ref&gt;  The word is of [[Italian language|Italian]] etymology literally translated as 'loudsoft'.

== Examples ==

Beethoven's [[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 8]] begins with a ''fortepiano'':

'''Dr. Gerald A. Soffen''' (February 7, 1926 – November 22, 2000), known as Jerry or Gerry, was a [[NASA]] scientist and educator who served in a wide variety of roles for the space agency, primarily dealing with either education or with life sciences—especially the search for life on Mars. 

He earned his A.B.S. from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], his M.S. from [[University of Southern California]], and his Ph.D. in Biology from [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa-academy.org/soffen.html |title=Dr. Gerald Soffen, Dies |publisher=The NASA Academy |date=Unlisted |accessdate=2011-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910180120/http://www.nasa-academy.org/soffen.html |archivedate=2009-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued his postdoctoral work at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830906103.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Working from NASA's [[Langley Research Center]] in the mid- to late-1970s, Dr. Soffen was project scientist for the NASA's [[Viking program]] of [[Mars]] landers, the first successful missions to perform unmanned experiments on the surface of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks" style="font-size: 100%;"&gt; [http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/news-release/releases/2000/h00-186.htm "HQ Press RELEASE: H00-186, NASA ASTROBIOLOGY ARCHITECT, DR. GERALD SOFFEN, DIES"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930200807/http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/news-release/releases/2000/h00-186.htm |date=2006-09-30 }}&lt;/span&gt;, NASA, November 24, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In that role, he oversaw all scientific investigations conducted by the landers, coordinating the work of more than seventy scientists around the nation.  In 1977 he appeared on an episode of the popular television series ''[[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search Of]]'' entitled "Martians" and he spoke about the Viking's findings up to that time. "We have started what will become an adventure of mankind in searching for not only the lower forms of life but also the search for intelligent life.  This is one of the milestones in the course of human destiny to find cousins."  Soffen also predicted that mankind would eventually colonize Mars by using [[Planetary Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nimoy|first1=Leonard|title=In Search of Martians|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0894191/|website=Internet Movie Database|publisher=Landsburg Productions|accessdate=2016|date=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:Soffen1.jpg|thumb|left|Gerald Soffen in 1977]]



Later, he would become NASA Langley's Chief Environmental Scientist, leading work on remote sensing by satellite as well as laboratory experiments, ground-based measurements, and theoretical models.

After concluding his work with Viking, Soffen became the director of [[Life Sciences]] at NASA Headquarters in 1978. In this position, Dr. Soffen was responsible for the agency-wide program to monitor and maintain the physical well being of NASA astronauts in space, as well as the Biomedical Program, the Space Biology Program, and the Exobiology (also sometimes called the Astrobiology) program. 

In 1983, Soffen transferred from NASA Headquarters to NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland. Initially, his role at GSFC focused on establishing the "Mission to Planet Earth" program; Soffen also served as the project scientist for NASA's Earth Observing System as that program was starting.

In the 1990s, though, Soffen's focus would shift to education. In 1990, Soffen lead the formation of the University Programs office at GSFC, an office he would manage for several years. Three years into that role, Soffen created [[NASA Academy]], NASA's premiere leadership training internship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/releases/2000/00-087.html |title=NASA - Mars Scientist and Astrobiology Architect, Dr. Gerald Soffen, Dies |publisher=NASA.gov |date=2000-11-24 |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990-92 he served on the Science Advisory Committee for [[Biosphere 2]].

Dr. Soffen has been memorialized in several ways by his peers and former students. The "Dr. Gerald A. Soffen Memorial Fund for the Advancement of Space Science Education" was established by the [[NASA Academy]] Alumni Association "to continue Jerry's commitment to the future of space by supporting motivated students in the fields of space science and engineering".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks" style="font-size: 100%;"&gt; [http://www.nasa-academy.org/soffen/fund.html "Dr. Gerald A. Soffen Memorial Fund for the Advancement of Space Science Education"]&lt;/span&gt;, NASA Academy Alumni Association, viewed Nov 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Gerald Soffen Memorial Panel/Lecture" is also a feature of the annual Space Studies program conducted by [[International Space University]].

Additionally, a crater on Mars was recently named "Soffen".&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;span class="plainlinks" style="font-size: 100%;"&gt; [http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=22632 Crater on Mars Named After Astrobiologist Gerald Soffen]&lt;/span&gt;", SpaceRef.com, November 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The crater is centered at 23.73 degrees S, 140.86 degrees E on Mars. The Viking 2 lander was also posthumously named after Dr. Soffen.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks" style="font-size: 100%;"&gt; [http://www.space.com/news/spaceagencies/soffen_viking_010720.html "Viking 2 Lander Renamed After Gerald Soffen"]&lt;/span&gt;, Space.com, July 20, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homoplasy''', in [[biology]] and [[phylogenetics]], is when a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] has been gained or lost independently in separate lineages over the course of evolution. This is different from [[Homology (biology)|homology]], which is the similarity of traits due to common ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Torres-Montúfar A, Borsch T, Ochoterena H | title = When Homoplasy Is Not Homoplasy: Dissecting Trait Evolution by Contrasting Composite and Reductive Coding | journal = Systematic Biology | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 543–551 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 28645204 | doi = 10.1093/sysbio/syx053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homoplasy can arise from both similar [[Natural selection|selection]] pressures acting on adapting species, and the effects of [[genetic drift]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolution: an introduction| vauthors = Stearns SC, Hoekstra RF |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=9780199255634 |edition=2nd|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall AR, Colegrave N | title = Decay of unused characters by selection and drift | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 610–7 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18081745 | doi = 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01473.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[File:Homoplasy.jpg|thumb|Homoplasy is the similarity in trait that is not due to a common ancestor.]]

Most often, homoplasy is viewed as a similarity in morphological traits. However, homoplasy may also appear in other trait types, such as similarity in the genetic sequence &lt;ref name="Reece2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson1996"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homoplasy: The Recurrence of Similarity in Evolution| vauthors =Sanderson MJ, Hufford L |publisher=Academic Press, Inc.|year=1996|isbn=0-12-618030-X|location=San Diego, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;, life cycle types &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silberfeld T, Leigh JW, Verbruggen H, Cruaud C, de Reviers B, Rousseau F | title = A multi-locus time-calibrated phylogeny of the brown algae (Heterokonta, Ochrophyta, Phaeophyceae): Investigating the evolutionary nature of the "brown algal crown radiation" | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 659–74 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20412862 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.04.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or even behavioral traits &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Queiroz A, Wimberger PH | title = The usefulness of behavior for phylogeny estimation: levels of homoplasy in behavioral and morphological characters | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 46–60 | date = February 1993 | pmid = 28568085 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1993.tb01198.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson1996" /&gt;.

== Etymology ==
The term homoplasy was first used by [[Ray Lankester]] in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Lankester ER |year=1870|title=On the use of the term homology in modern zoology, and the distinction between homogenetic and homoplastic agreements.|journal=Annals and Magazine of Natural History|volume=6|pages=34-43|doi=10.1080/00222937008696201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding adjective is either ''homoplasic'' or ''homoplastic''.
It is derived from the two [[ancient greek]] words {{wikt-lang|grc|ὁμός}} ({{grc-transl|ὁμός}}), meaning "similar, alike, the same", and {{wikt-lang|grc|πλάσσω}} ({{grc-transl|πλάσσω}}), meaning "to shape, to mold".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Abrégé du dictionnaire grec français |last=Bailly |first=Anatole | name-list-format = vanc |date=1981-01-01 |publisher=Hachette |isbn=2010035283 |location=Paris |oclc=461974285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tabularium.be/bailly/ |title=Greek-french dictionary online |last=Bailly |first=Anatole | name-list-format = vanc|date= |website=www.tabularium.be | |access-date=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comenius.susqu.edu/biol/202/dictionary%20of%20terms/h/homoplasy.htm|title=Systematic Biology - Dictionary of Terms: Homoplasy| vauthors = Holt JR, Judica CA |date=February 4, 2014| |access-date=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reece2011"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Campbell Biology| vauthors = Reece JB, Urry LA, Cain ML, Wasserman SA, Minorsky PV, Jackson RB  |publisher=Pearson|year=2011|isbn=9780321739759|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parallelism and convergence ==
[[Parallel evolution|Parallel]] and [[convergent evolution]] lead to homoplasy when different species independently evolve or gain a comparable trait, which diverges from the trait inferred to have been present in their common ancestor. When the similar traits are caused by an equivalent developmental mechanism, the process is referred to as parallel evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Archie JW |year=1989|title=Homoplasy excess ratios: new indices for measuring levels of homoplasy in phylogenetic systematics and a critique of the consistency index|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=38|pages=253-269|doi=10.2307/2992286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Wake DB |date= September 1991 |title=Homoplasy: The Result of Natural Selection, or Evidence of Design Limitations? |journal=The American Naturalist|language=en|volume=138|issue=3|pages=543–567|doi=10.1086/285234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is called convergent evolution when the similarity arises from different developmental mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Hodin J |year=2000|title=Plasticity and constraints in development and evolution|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|volume=288|pages=1-20|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-010X(20000415)288:1&lt;1::AID-JEZ1&gt;3.0.CO;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of homoplasy may occur when different lineages live in comparable ecological niches that require similar adaptations for an increase in fitness. An interesting example is that of the marsupial moles ([[Notoryctidae]]), golden moles ([[Chrysochloridae]]) and northern moles ([[Talpidae]]). These are mammals from different geographical regions and lineages, and have all independently evolved very similar burrowing characteristics (such as a cone-shaped heads and flat frontal claws) to live in a subterranean ecological niche &lt;ref name="Nevo1979"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Nevo E |year=1979|title=Adaptive convergence and divergence of subterranean mammals|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=10|pages=269-308|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.10.110179.001413}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Reversion ==
In contrast, [[Reverse evolution|reversal]] (a.k.a. vestigialization) leads to homoplasy through the disappearance of previously gained traits &lt;ref name="Wake2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wake DB, Wake MH, Specht CD | title = Homoplasy: from detecting pattern to determining process and mechanism of evolution | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6020 | pages = 1032–5 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21350170 | doi = 10.1126/science.1188545 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Distinguishing homology from homoplasy ==

Homoplasy, especially the type that occurs in more closely related phylogenetic groups, can make phylogenetic analysis more challenging. [[Phylogenetic tree|Phylogenetic trees]] are created by means of [[parsimony analysis]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Phylogenetics: Theory and Practice of Phylogenetic Systematics| vauthors = Wiley EO, Lieberman BS |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=2011 |isbn=9780470905968 |location=Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications| vauthors = Schuh RT, Brower AV |publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780801462436|location=Ithaca, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These analyses can be done with phenotypic, as well as genetic traits (DNA sequences) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inferring phylogenies|vauthors = Felsenstein J |publisher=Sinauer|year=2004|isbn=978-0878931774}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Using parsimony analysis, the hypothesis that requires the fewest evolutionary changes is preferred over alternative hypotheses. Construction of these trees may become a challenge when clouded by the occurrence of homoplasy in the traits used for the analysis. The most important approach in overcoming these challenges, is by increasing the amount of independent (non-[[Pleiotropy|pleiotropic]], non-[[Genetic linkage|linked]]) characteristics used in the construction of these phylogenic trees. Along with parsimony analysis, one could perform a likelihood analysis, where the probability of a tree being true is calculated and branch lengths are measured; and bootstrapping, in which trees are constructed for each characteristic separately to estimate the confidence of a tree.&lt;ref name="Sanderson1996" /&gt;

According to [[Cladogram#Measuring homoplasy|cladistic interpretation]], homoplasy can be identified when a given similarity in trait cannot be explained by relation through a common ancestor on a preferred phylogenetic hypothesis - that is, the feature in question arises (or disappears) at more than one point on the tree &lt;ref name="Wake2011" /&gt;.

In the case of DNA sequences, homoplasy cannot be avoided due to its four-state nature. An observed homoplasy may simply be the result of  [[Genetic drift|random nucleotide substitutions]] accumulating over time, and thus may not need an [[adaptationist]] evolutionary explanation &lt;ref name="Sanderson1996" /&gt;.

== Examples and applications of homoplasy ==

There are numerous documented examples of homoplasy within the following taxa:
* Eusiroidea ([[Crustaceans]] and [[Amphipoda]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Verheye ML, Martin P, Backeljau T, D'Udekem D'Acoz C |date=2015-12-22|title=DNA analyses reveal abundant homoplasy in taxonomically important morphological characters of Eusiroidea (Crustacea, Amphipoda) |journal=Zoologica Scripta |volume=45|issue=3|pages=300–321|doi=10.1111/zsc.12153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Tarantula]] spiders of the genus ''Bonnetina'': nearly all morphological traits within this genus are homoplastic. Only sexual features were observed to not be homoplastic, suggesting that sexual selection may have been a driving force in the divergence of tarantulas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ortiz D, Francke OF, Bond JE | title = A tangle of forms and phylogeny: Extensive morphological homoplasy and molecular clock heterogeneity in Bonnetina and related tarantulas | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 127 | pages = 55–73 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 29778724 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2018.05.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The occurrence of homoplasy can also be used to make predictions about evolution. Recent studies have used homoplasy to predict the possibility and the path of extraterrestrial evolution. For example, Levin et al. (2017) suggest that the development of eye-like structures is highly likely, due to its numerous, independently evolved incidences on earth.&lt;ref name="Wake2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Levin SR, Scott TW, Cooper HS, West SA |year=2017|title=Darwin's aliens|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|pages=1-9|doi=10.1017/S1473550417000362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homoplasy vs. evolutionary contingency ==

In his book [[Wonderful Life (book)|''Wonderful Life'']], [[Stephen Jay Gould]] claims that repeating the evolutionary process, from any point in time onward, would not produce the same results &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History| vauthors = Gould SJ |publisher=Vintage Books|year=2000|isbn=9780099273455|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The occurrence of homoplasy is viewed by some biologists as an argument against Gould’s theory of evolutionary contingency. Powell &amp; Mariscal (2015) argue that this disagreement is caused by an [[equivocation]] and that both the theory of contingency as well as homoplastic occurrence can be true at the same time &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell R, Mariscal C | title = Convergent evolution as natural experiment: the tape of life reconsidered | journal = Interface Focus | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 20150040 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26640647 | doi = 10.1098/rsfs.2015.0040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Deities depicted with horns or antlers are found in many different religions across the world.

==Horned goddess Hathor==
{{Main|Hathor}}
[[File:MekauraHeldByGoddessHathor MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.png|thumb|right|Close-up of a triad statue depicting the pharaoh Mekaura being held by the goddess [[Hathor]].]]
Hathor is commonly depicted as a cow goddess with head horns in which is set a sun disk with [[Uraeus]]. Twin feathers are also sometimes shown in later periods as well as a {{not a typo|menat}} necklace. Hathor may be the cow goddess who is depicted from an early date on the Narmer Palette and on a stone urn dating from the 1st dynasty that suggests a role as sky-goddess and a relationship to Horus who, as a sun god, is "housed" in her.
{{Main|Hathor#Relationships, associations, images and symbols}}
Hathor had a complex relationship with [[Ra]], in one myth she is his [[eye of Ra|eye]] and considered his daughter but later, when Ra assumes the role of Horus with respect to Kingship, she is considered Ra's mother. She absorbed this role from another cow goddess 'Mht wrt' ("Great flood") who was the mother of Ra in a creation myth and carried him between her horns. As a mother she gave birth to Ra each morning on the eastern horizon and as wife she conceives through union with him each day.
{{Main|Bat (goddess)}}
Bat was a cow goddess in [[Egyptian mythology]] depicted as a human face with cow ears and horns. By the time of the Middle Kingdom her identity and attributes were subsumed within the goddess Hathor. The worship of Bat dates to earliest times and may have its origins in Late Paleolithic cattle herding. Bat was the chief goddess of Seshesh, otherwise known as Hu or Diospolis Parva, the 7th nome of Upper Egypt.
The imagery of Bat as a divine cow was remarkably similar to that of Hathor the parallel goddess from Lower Egypt. The significant difference in their depiction is that Bat's horns curve inward and Hathor's curve outward slightly. It is possible that this could be based in the different breeds of cattle herded at different times.

==Cult of the bull deities==

{{main|Bull (mythology)#Egypt}}
In Egypt, the bull was worshiped as [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis]], the embodiment of [[Ptah]] and later of [[Osiris]]. A long series of ritually perfect bulls were identified by the god's priests, housed in the temple for their lifetime, then embalmed and encased in a giant [[sarcophagus]]. A long sequence of monolithic stone sarcophagi were housed in the [[Serapeum]], and were rediscovered by [[Auguste Mariette]] at [[Saqqara]] in 1851. The bull was also worshipped as [[Mnevis]], the embodiment of [[Atum-Ra]], in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].  ''Ka'' in Egyptian is both a religious concept of life-force/power and the word for bull.
{{main|Mnevis}}
Mnevis was identified as being a living bull. This may be a vestige of the sacrifice of kings after a period of reign, who were seen as the sons of [[Bat (goddess)|Bat]] or [[Hathor]] (see:[[Horned deity#Horned goddess Hathor|horned goddess Hathor]]), the ancient cow deity of the early solar cults. Thus, seen as a symbol of the later sun god, Ra, the Mnevis was often depicted, in [[art]], with the solar disc of their mother, Hathor between its horns.
[[File:Isis Enthroned-Egyptian-650-BCE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Isis]] with horns]]{{main|Bull (mythology)#Levant}}
The [[Canaan]]ite deity [[Moloch]] (according to the bible) was often depicted as a bull, and became a bull demon in [[Abrahamic]] traditions. The bull is familiar in [[Judeo-Christian]] cultures from the [[Biblical]] episode wherein an [[idolatry|idol]] of the [[Golden Calf]] is made by [[Aaron]] and worshipped by the Hebrews in the wilderness of Sinai (''[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]'').  The text of the [[Hebrew Bible]] can be understood to refer to the idol as representing a separate god, or as representing the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]] himself, perhaps through an association or syncretization with Egyptian or [[Levant]]ine bull gods, rather than a new deity in itself.

[http://biblelexicon.org/exodus/32-4.htm Exodus 32:4] "He took this from their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, 'This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt'."

[http://biblelexicon.org/exodus/32-4.htm Nehemiah 9:18] "even when they made an idol shaped like a calf and said, 'This is your god who brought you out of Egypt!' They committed terrible blasphemies."

Calf-idols are referred to later in the Tanakh, such as in the Book of [http://bible.cc/hosea/10-5.htm Hosea], which would seem accurate as they were a fixture of near-eastern cultures.

[[King Solomon|King Solomon's]] "bronze sea"-basin stood on twelve brazen bulls, according to [http://bible.cc/1_kings/7-25.htm 1. Kings 7:25].

Young bulls were set as frontier markers at [[Tel Dan]] and at [[Bethel]] the frontiers of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]].

==Ram deities in ancient Egypt==
[[File:Banebdjedet of Mendes.jpg|thumb|left|Banebdjedet]]
The ram was revered in [[ancient Egypt]] in matters of fertility and war. Early gods with long wavy ram horns include [[Khnum]] and the equivalent god in [[Lower Egypt]], [[Banebdjedet]], the "Ram Lord of Djedet" ([[Mendes]]), who was typically shown with four ram heads to represent the four souls (''[[Ba (Egyptian soul)|Ba]]'') of the sun god.&lt;ref name="pinch"/&gt; Banebdjedet may also be linked to the first four gods to rule over Egypt, [[Osiris]], [[Geb]], [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and [[Ra]]-[[Atum]], with large granite shrines devoted to each in the Mendes sanctuary. The ''[[Book of the Heavenly Cow]]'' describes the "Ram of Mendes" as being the Ba of Osiris, but this was not an exclusive association.&lt;ref name="pinch"&gt;''Handbook of Egyptian mythology'', Geraldine Pinch, p 114-115, Oxford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-517024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

List of Egyptian gods  associated with the ram:
* [[Khnum]] (one of the earliest Egyptian deities)
* [[Heryshaf]] (a ram god of [[Herakleopolis Magna|Heracleopolis]])
* [[Kherty]] (a variant of [[Aken (god)|Aken]], The chief deity in Egyptian mythology)
* [[Andjety]] (precursor of Osiris, Auf "Efu Ra").
* [[Horem Akhet]] (a god depicted as a [[sphinx]] with the head of a man, lion, or ram)
* [[Banebdjedet]] (ram god linked to the first four Egyptian gods: Osiris, Geb, Shu, Ra-Atum)
* [[Amun#Cult in Nubia, Libya, and Greece|Amun]] (the ram deity that inspired the cult of Ammon)

==Cult of Ammon==
{{Main|Amun#Cult in Nubia, Libya, and Greece}}
[[File:Museo Barracco - Giove Ammone 1010637.JPG|thumb|right|Roman cast terracotta of ram-horned Jupiter Ammon, 1st century AD (Museo Barracco, Rome)]]
The worship of Ammon was introduced into Greece at an early period, probably through the medium of the Greek colony in [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], which must have formed a connection with the great oracle of Ammon in the Oasis soon after its establishment. Ammon had a temple and a statue, the gift of [[Pindar]], at Thebes,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' ix.16 § 1&lt;/ref&gt; and another at [[Sparta]], the inhabitants of which, as [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] says,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' iii.18 § 2&lt;/ref&gt; consulted the oracle of Ammon in Libya from early times more than the other Greeks. At [[Aphytis]], Chalcidice, Ammon was worshipped, from the time of [[Lysander]], as zealously as in Ammonium. Pindar the poet honoured the god with a hymn. At [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] the god was represented with the head of a ram (Paus. viii.32 § 1), and the Greeks of Cyrenaica dedicated at Delphi a chariot with a statue of Ammon.

Such was its reputation among the Classical Greeks that [[Alexander the Great]] journeyed there after the [[battle of Issus]] and during his occupation of Egypt, where he was declared ''the son of Amun'' by the oracle.  Alexander thereafter considered himself divine.  Even during this occupation, Amun, identified by these Greeks as a form of [[Zeus]],&lt;ref&gt;Jerem. xlvi.25&lt;/ref&gt; continued to be the principal local deity of Thebes.
{{Main|Berber mythology#Before the battle of Irassa (570 BC)}}
The Cyrenaican Greeks built temples for the Libyan god Amon instead of their original god [[Zeus]]. They later identified their supreme god [[Zeus]] with the Libyan Amon.&lt;ref&gt;Oric Bates, The Eastern Libyans.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them continued worshipping Amon himself.
Amon's cult was so widespread among the Greeks that even [[Alexander the Great]] decided to be declared as the son of Zeus in the [[Siwa Oasis|Siwan]] temple by the Libyan priests of Amon.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Chafik, revue Tifinagh...&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SFEC EGYPT KARNAK 2006-001.JPG|thumb|left|Ram statues line the entrance to Amun's Temple]]{{Main|Berber mythology#Amun as a common deity}}
Although the most modern sources ignored the existence of Amun in the Berber mythology, he was maybe the greatest ancient Berber god.&lt;ref&gt;H. Basset, Les influences puniques chez les Berbères, pp 367-368&lt;/ref&gt; He was honored by the Ancient Greeks in Cyrenaica, and was united with the Phoenician/Carthaginian god [[Baal-hamon]] due to Libyan influence.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Chafik, Revue Tifinagh...&lt;/ref&gt; Some depictions of the [[Sheep|ram]] across North Africa belong to the lythic period which is situated between [[9th millennium BC|9600 BC]] and 7500 BC. &lt;br /&gt;
The most famous Amun's temple in Ancient Libya was the temple at the oasis of [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]].
The name of the ancient Berber tribes: ''[[Garamantes]]'' and ''Nasamonians'' are believed by some scholars to be related to the name ''Amon''.&lt;ref&gt;Helene Hagan, The Shining Ones: An Etymological Essay on the Amazigh Roots of the Egyptian civilization, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Berber mythology#Solar and lunar worship}}
In Awelimmiden [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], the name ''Amanai'' is believed to have the meaning of "[[God]]". The [[Ancient Libya]]ns may have worshipped the setting sun, which was personified by Amon, who was represented by the [[Sheep|ram]]'s [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;James Hastings.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Baʿal#Baʿal of Carthage}}
In Carthage and North Africa [[Baal-hamon]] was especially associated with the ram and was worshiped also as Baʿal Qarnaim ("Lord of Two Horns") in an open-air sanctuary at Jebel Bu Kornein ("the two-horned hill") across the bay from Carthage.
{{Main|Alexander the Great in the Qur'an#The two-horned one}}
[[File:Alexander-Coin.jpg|thumb|right|Silver tetradrachmon (ancient Greek coin) issued in the name of Alexander the Great, depicting Alexander with the horns of Ammon.]]

The [[Egyptian pantheon|Egyptian god]] [[Ammon-Ra]] was depicted with [[Sheep|ram]] horns. Rams were considered a symbol of [[virility]] due to their [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] behavior. The horns of Ammon may have also represented the East and West of the Earth, and one of the titles of [[Ammon]] was "the two-horned." Alexander was depicted with the horns of Ammon as a result of his conquest of [[ancient Egypt]] in 332 BC, where the priesthood received him as the son of the god Ammon, who was identified by the ancient Greeks with [[Zeus]], the [[King of the Gods]]. The combined [[deity]] Zeus-Ammon was a distinct figure in ancient Greek mythology. According to five historians of antiquity ([[Arrian]], [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]], [[Diodorus]], [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], and [[Plutarch]]), Alexander visited the [[Oracle of Ammon]] at [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]] in the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] desert and rumors spread that the Oracle had revealed Alexander's father to be the [[deity]] Ammon, rather than Philip.&lt;ref name=coin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124716/coin/15880/From-the-Persian-Wars-to-Alexander-the-Great-490-336-bc|title=Coin: from the Persian Wars to Alexander the Great, 490–336 bc|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Green2007|Green 2007]]. p.382&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=plutarch&gt;Plutarch, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plut.+Caes.+27.1 ''Alexander'', 27]&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander styled himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon and even demanded to be worshiped as a god:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He seems to have become convinced of the reality of his own [[divinity]] and to have required its acceptance by others ... The cities perforce complied, but often ironically: the [[Sparta]]n decree read, '' 'Since Alexander wishes to be a god, let him be a god.' ''&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Alexander III, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] was a god of shepherds and flocks, of mountain wilds and rustic music.

Depictions in [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] cultures of figures with antlers are often identified as [[Cernunnos]] ("horned one" in Latin). The prime evidence for this comes from a pillar in Paris which also features the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, Miranda J. ''Animals in Celtic Life and Myth''. pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cocidius]] was the name of a [[Romano-British]] war-god and local deity from the area around [[Hadrian's Wall]], who is sometimes represented as being horned.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Miranda J.

The [[Pashupati seal]], a seal discovered during the excavation of [[Mohenjo-daro]] in [[Pakistan]] has drawn attention as a possible representation of a "proto-Shiva" figure.&lt;ref name="Flood 1996, pp. 28-29"&gt;Flood (1996), pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; This "[[Pashupati]]" (Lord of animal-like beings – Sanskrit ''{{IAST|paśupati}}'')&lt;ref&gt;For translation of ''{{IAST|paśupati}}'' as "Lord of Animals" see: Michaels, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; seal shows a seated figure with horns, possibly ithyphallic, surrounded by animals.&lt;ref&gt;For a drawing of the seal see Figure 1 ''in'': Flood (1996), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on demonology==

[[File:MuseoArchNapoliGSpancapra3122.jpg|thumb|right|Pan enjoying a goat]]

===Christian demonology===
{{main|Christian demonology#Appearance}}
The idea that demons have horns seems to have been taken from the [[Book of Revelation]] chapter 13. The book of Revelation seems to have inspired many depictions of demons. This idea has also been associated with the depiction of certain ancient gods like [[Moloch]] and the [[shedu]], etc., which were portrayed as bulls, as men with the head of a bull, or wearing bull horns as a crown.

===Baphomet of Mendes===
The satanic "horned god" symbol known as the [[baphomet]] is based on an [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] ram deity that was worshipped in [[Mendes]], called [[Banebdjed]] (literally [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul|Ba]] of the lord of [[djed]], and titled "the Lord of Mendes"), who was the soul of [[Osiris]]. According to ''Egyptian Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Goddesses, and Traditions of ancient Egypt'', the book's author [[Geraldine Harris]], said the ram gods Ra-[[Amun]] (see: [[Horned deity#Cult of Ammon|Cult of Ammon]]), and Banebdjed, were to mystically unite with the [[Great Royal Wife|queen of Egypt]] to sire the heir to the throne (a theory based on depictions found in several Theban temples in Mendes).

Occultist [[Eliphas Levi]] in his ''[[Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie]]'' (1855), combined the images of the [[Tarot of Marseilles]]' [[The Devil (Tarot card)|Devil card]] and refigured the ram Banebdjed as a he-goat, calling it the "[[Baphomet]] of Mendes," (or, "Goat of Mendes"). The inaccurate description can be traced back to ''Herodotus' [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] Book II'', where [[Herodotus]] describes the deity of Mendes as having a goat's head and fleece, when Banebdjedet was really represented by a [[Sheep|ram]], not a [[goat]].
[[File:RWS Tarot 15 Devil.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Devil (Tarot card)|The Devil]] in the [[Rider-Waite Tarot deck]].]]{{Main|Baphomet#Aleister Crowley}}
The Baphomet of Lévi was to become an important figure within the cosmology of [[Thelema]], the mystical system established by [[Aleister Crowley]] in the early twentieth century.  Baphomet features in the Creed of the [[Gnostic Catholic Church]] recited by the congregation in ''[[The Gnostic Mass]]'', in the sentence: "And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in His name BAPHOMET" (see: [[Aleister Crowley#Occult|Aleister Crowley: Occult]]).
{{Main|Baphomet#As a demon}}
Lévi's Baphomet is the source of the later [[The Devil (Tarot card)|Tarot image of the Devil]] in the [[Rider-Waite tarot deck|Rider-Waite design]]. The concept of a downward-pointing [[pentagram]] on its forehead was enlarged upon by Lévi in his discussion (without illustration) of the Goat of Mendes arranged within such a pentagram, which he contrasted with the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosmic man]] arranged within a similar but upright pentagram. The actual image of a goat in a downward-pointing pentagram first appeared in the 1897 book ''La Clef de la Magie Noire'' by [[Stanislas de Guaita]], later adopted as the official symbol—called the [[Sigil of Baphomet]]—of the [[Church of Satan]], and continues to be used among [[Satanism|Satanists]].

===Neopaganism===
{{main|Devil#Neopaganism}}[[File:Francisco de Goya y Lucientes - Witches' Sabbath - WGA10007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Francisco de Goya]]'s ''[[Witches' Sabbath (1789)|Witches Sabbat]]'' (1789), which depicts [[the Devil]] flanked by Satanic witches. The Witch Cult hypothesis states that such stories are based upon a real-life pagan cult that revered a horned god]]
Few neopagan reconstructionist traditions recognize Satan or the Devil outright.  However, many neopagan groups worship some sort of [[Horned God]], for example as a consort of the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Great Goddess]] in [[Wicca]]. These gods usually reflect [[mythology|mythological]] figures such as [[Cernunnos]] or [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], and any similarity they may have to the Christian Devil seems to date back only to the 19th century, when a Christian reaction to Pan's growing importance in literature and art resulted in his image being translated to that of the Devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Hutton |title=Triumph of the Moon |page=46 |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford UniverUniversity Press |location=Oxford |ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|left|Image of a 19th-century Sabbatic Goat]]

===Witch-cult hypothesis===
{{main|Witch-cult hypothesis#Post-Murray}}
In 1985 Classical historian [[Georg Luck]], in his ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds'', theorised that the origins of the Witch-cult may have appeared in late antiquity as a faith primarily designed to worship the Horned God, stemming from the merging of [[Cernunnos]], a horned god of the Celts, with the Greco-Roman [[Pan (god)|Pan]]/[[Faunus]],&lt;ref name="LuckArcana"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Gerog Luck |last=Luck |first=Georg |year=1985 |title=Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Collection of Ancient Texts. |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining [[pagan]]s, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the [[Devil]], and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.&lt;ref name="LuckArcana" /&gt;

===Beelzebub===
[[File:Horned deity.jpg|thumb|right|Horned demon? (proto-Elamite 3000–2800 BC)]]
{{main|Christian teaching about the Devil#New Testament}}
There is an implied connection between Satan and [[Beelzebub]] (lit. ''Lord of the Flies''), originally a [[Semitic deity]] called [[Baal]] (lit. "lord"). Beelzebub is the most recognized demon in the Bible, whose name has become analogous to Satan. Occult and metaphysical author [[Michelle Belanger]] believes that Beelzebub (a mockery of the original name&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=498&amp;letter=B] Jewish Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;) is the horned god Ba'al [[Hadad]], whose cult symbol was the bull.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Demons: Names of the Damned By Michelle Belanger -Page 56&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca'', Beelzebub reigned over the Witches' Sabbath ("synagoga"&lt;ref&gt;Witch hunts in the western world: persecution and punishment from the ... Page 87 - by Brian Alexander Pavlac&lt;/ref&gt;), and that witches denied Christ in his name and chanted "Beelzebub" as they danced.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca'' by [[Rosemary Ellen Guiley]]. p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;
{{main|Beelzebub#Christian demonology and occult}}
Beelzebub was also imagined to be sowing his influence in Salem, Massachusetts: his name came up repeatedly during the [[Salem witch trials]], the last large-scale public expression of witch hysteria in North America or Europe, and afterwards Rev. [[Cotton Mather]] wrote a [[pamphlet]] entitled ''Of Beelzebub and his Plot.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020921203915/http://www.4literature.net/Cotton_Mather/Of_Beelzebub_and_His_Plot|title=Of Beelzebub and His Plot by Cotton Mather|date=21 September 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neopaganism==
{{main|Horned God}}
In 1933, the Egyptologist [[Margaret Murray]] published the book, ''The God of the Witches'', in which she theorised that Pan was merely one form of a [[horned god]] who was worshipped across Europe by a [[Witch Cult hypothesis|witch-cult]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Ronald Hutton]], page 199&lt;/ref&gt; This theory influenced the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] notion of the Horned God, as an [[archetype]] of male virility and sexuality. In [[Wicca]], the archetype of the Horned God is highly important, and is thought by believers to be represented by such deities as the Celtic [[Cernunnos]], Indian [[Pashupati]] and Greek Pan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Horned God in Wiccan based neopagan religions represents a [[Solar deity|solar god]] often associated with [[vegetation deity|vegetation]], that's honored as the ''Holly King'' or ''Oak King'' in [[Neopagan]] rituals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/yulethelongestnight/p/Holly_KIng_Yule.htm] The Legend of the Holly King and the Oak King
By Patti Wigington&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, the Horned God is considered a male [[List of fertility deities|fertility god]].&lt;ref&gt;The Quest: A Search for the Grail of Immortality by Rhuddlwm Gawr pg. 210&lt;/ref&gt; The use of horns as a symbol for power dates back to the ancient world. From ancient [[Egyptians|Egypt]] and the [[Ba'al]] worshipping [[Canaanite religion|Cannanites]], to the [[Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Celts]], and various other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Myth and Territory in the Spartan Mediterranean by Irad Malkin pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Horns have ever been present in religious imagery as symbols of fertility and power.&lt;ref&gt;Wicca: The Complete Craft by Deanna J. Conway pg. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Language of God in the Universe by Helena Lehman pg. 301&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until Christianity attributed horns to [[Satan]] as part of his iconography that horned gods became associated with evil in Western mythology:&lt;ref&gt;The Devil: perceptions of evil from antiquity to primitive Christianity by Jeffrey Burton Russell pg. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern [[Neopaganism|neo-Pagans]] focus their worship on a horned god, or often "the" Horned God and one or more goddesses. Deities such as [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and [[Dionysus]] have had attributes of their worship imported into the [[Neopagan]] concept as have the Celtic [[Cernunnos]] and [[Gwynn ap Nudd]], one of the mythological leaders of the [[Wild Hunt]]&lt;ref&gt;Fabulous creatures, mythical monsters, and animal power symbols: a handbook by Cassandra Eason pg. 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism By Shelley Rabinovitch, James Lewis pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford companion to world mythology by David Adams Leeming pg. 360&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The outer temple of witchcraft: circles, spells, and rituals by Christopher Penczak  pg. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2358">The '''Hubert Curien Laboratory''' or ''Laboratoire Hubert Curien ''is a joint research unit (UMR 5516) of [[Jean Monnet University|the University of Saint-Etienne]], the National Research Centre [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]], and (since 2016) the [[École supérieure d'optique|Institut d'Optique Graduate School]]. It is composed of about 90 researchers, professors and assistant professors, 20 	engineers and administrative staff, and 130 Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researcher. This makes the Hubert Curien Laboratory with a total of about 240 staff the most important research structure of [[Saint-Etienne]].

The various research activities of the laboratory are organized into two scientific departments:  "[[Optics]], [[photonics]] and [[microwave]]" and "[[Computer science]], [[Telecommunication|telecom]] and [[Image analysis|image]]". The research activity is structured into scientific projects within 6 main teams: "Micro/Nano structuring", "Radiation-matter Interaction", "Image Science &amp; computer vision", "Data Intelligence", "Connected Intelligence" and "Secure Embedded Systems &amp; Hardware Architectures."

The Hubert Curien laboratory coordinates the laboratory of excellence MANUTECH-SISE and the equipment of excellence MANUTECH-USD in partnership with some laboratories of the [[University of Lyon]] (LTDS, LDF, LaMCoS) and the company HEF. The partners aim at understanding the surface phenomena such as
[[wear]], [[friction]], [[wetting]], etc. They also aim at creating and controlling the surface functionalities, and at developing advanced manufacturing processes of surfaces and interfaces of different level, in particular processes of  ultrafast laser texturation.

In the last few years, the laboratory has paying a special attention to interdisciplinary scientific projects including in materials and surface engineering, in [[image processing]], in [[Computer vision]] or in [[artificial intelligence]].

An '''ichnotaxon''' (plural '''ichnotaxa''') is defined by the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] as "a [[taxon]] based on the fossilized work of an organism", that is, the non-human equivalent of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]].

== Definition==
Ichnotaxa are names used to identify and distinguish [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] distinctive [[trace fossil|ichnofossils]], more commonly known as trace fossils. They are assigned [[genus]] and [[species]] ranks by [[ichnologist]]s, much like organisms in [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. These are known as '''ichnogenera''' and '''ichnospecies''', respectively. "Ichnogenus" and "ichnospecies" are commonly abbreviated as "igen." and "isp.". The binomial names of ichnospecies and their genera are to be written in [[italics]].

Most researchers classify trace fossils only as far as the ichnogenus rank, based upon trace fossils that resemble each other in morphology but have subtle differences. Some authors have constructed detailed hierarchies up to ichnosuperclass, recognizing such fine detail as to identify ichnosuperorder and ichnoinfraclass, but such attempts are controversial.

==Etymology==
''Ichnotaxa'' comes from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] ίχνος, ''ichnos'' meaning ''track'' and ταξις, ''taxis'' meaning ''ordering''.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ichno 'ichno'] at [[dictionary.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
Due to the chaotic nature of trace fossil classification, several ichnogenera hold names normally affiliated with animal body fossils or plant fossils. For example, many ichnogenera are named with the suffix ''-phycus'' due to misidentification as algae.&lt;ref name="TreatiseSupp1"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=9780813730271|title= Miscellanea: Supplement 1, Trace Fossils and Problematica | last1= Häntzschel | first1= Walter | editor1-last = Moore | editor1-first= Raymond C. | year=  1975  | publisher= Geological Society of America | series= Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Hitchcock]] was the first to use the now common ''-ichnus'' suffix in 1858, with ''[[Cochlichnus]]''.&lt;ref name="TreatiseSupp1" /&gt;

==History==
Due to trace fossils' history of being difficult to classify, there have been several attempts to enforce consistency in the naming of ichnotaxa.

In 1961, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] ruled that most trace fossil taxa named after 1930 would be no longer available.&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Donovan|editor1-first=Stephen K.|title=The Palaeobiology of Trace Fossils|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-94843-8|date=28 March 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics of research include the theoretical, ethical, and practical implications of commodification, appropriation, and other flows of knowledge about the past, and how these may affect communities, researchers, and other stakeholders.

==Purpose==

===Objectives===
* To document the diversity of principles, interpretations, and actions arising in response to [[intellectual property]] issues in [[cultural heritage]] worldwide;
* To generate more robust theoretical understandings as well as norms of good practice in heritage work; and
* To make findings available to stakeholders, from Aboriginal communities to professional organizations to government agencies, allowing them to develop and refine their own theories, principles, policies and practices.

===Mission===
IPinCH is an international collaboration of [[archaeologists]], [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous organizations]], [[lawyers]], [[anthropologists]], [[ethicists]], museum specialists, policy makers, and others, working to facilitate fair and equitable exchanges of knowledge relating to heritage. The IPinCH Project is concerned with the theoretical, ethical, and practical implications of [[commodification]], [[appropriation (sociology)|appropriation]], and other flows of knowledge about the past, and how these may affect communities, researchers, and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].

===Vision===
IPinCH provides a foundation of research, knowledge and resources to assist archaeologists, academic institutions, descendant communities, scholars, policy makers, and other stakeholders in negotiating more equitable and successful terms of research and policies through an agenda of community-based research and topical exploration of intellectual property (IP) issues. IPinCH focuses on archaeology as a primary component of cultural heritage; however, this project is ultimately concerned with larger issues of the nature of knowledge and rights based on culture—how these are defined and used, who has control and access, and especially how fair and appropriate use and access can be achieved to the benefit of all stakeholders in the past.

==Project Description==
The 7-year project began in 2008 with a $2.5 million grant from the Major Collaborative Research Initiatives program of Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sshrc.ca/ Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council&lt;/ref&gt;  About one-fourth of the project budget is reserved for student fellowships&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/opportunities/Students student fellowships&lt;/ref&gt; and research support, and one-fourth for community-based heritage research for case studies&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project_components case studies&lt;/ref&gt; related to the project themes.

The IPinCH Project is led by Dr. Nicholas and guided by a steering committee of six team members representing five universities ([https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/catherine-bell Catherine Bell] [University of Alberta], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/joe-watkins Joe Watkins] [University of Oklahoma], and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/john-r-welch John Welch] [Simon Fraser University], plus Hollowell and Bannister). Team members represent nine Canadian and nineteen international universities, and eleven Canadian and international organizations.  A project advisory board will review project activities in addition to advising on strategies for linking with stakeholders and dissemination of results ([https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/michael-brown Michael Brown] [Williams College], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/larry-chartrand Larry Chartrand] [Métis; University of Winnipeg], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/robert-layton Robert Layton] [University of Durham, UK], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/peter-levesque Peter Levesque] [Principal Director, KMbW - Knowledge Mobilization Works], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/robert-paterson Robert K.

The IPinCH project initially had three components:
* [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/community-based-initiatives Community Initiatives]
* [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/working-groups Working Groups]
* [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/knowledge-base Knowledge Base]
As of March 2016, eight of the twelve community initiatives have been completed and the final reports are available on the IPinCH website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/community-based-initiatives|title=IPinCH Community Initiatives|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for details on IPinCH’s Community Initiatives, please see below). To accommodate broadening research interests and developments, IPinCH Working Groups have been reconceptualized as Research Themes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/working-groups|title=Working Groups|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see section below on Research Themes).

In IPinCH’s [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/community-based-initiatives Community-Based Initiatives] (CBIs), team members work closely with communities to investigate and address pressing cultural heritage challenges in specific contexts. IPinCH-supported Community-Based Initiatives are located all over the globe. We fund seventeen initiatives, based in Australia, Canada, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, New Zealand, and the United States, working with groups such as the Inuvialuit, the Penobscot Nation, the Ainu, the Hopi Tribe, and the Moriori.

IPinCH values a collaborative approach and employs Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR)&lt;ref&gt;Minkler, M., and N. Wallerstein (editors) 2003 Community-Based Participatory Research for Health. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Springett, J. 2003 Issues in Participatory Evaluation.

Native Studies Review 8 (2): pp. 51–74&lt;/ref&gt; methods that engage the community in all aspects of the research process. In the CBIs, communities determine the research goals, which form for the foundation for the initiative, including the practical and theoretical outputs. After community review, the results of these initiatives will be made available to partner organizations and stakeholders, in order to assist them in refining their own policies and approaches.

Key features of a CBPR methodology include: 
*A collaborative approach that engages the community or organization in all aspects of the research process—from development of research questions and research design to conducting the research, designing outputs, and disseminating results;
*Research goals that prioritize community needs and result in direct community benefits;
*Projects that contribute to community capacity building and to sustainable and more equitable relations between the community and outside researchers, promote respect for local values, and address mistrust, inequity, and similar issues in conventional research.

Twelve community initiatives received funding from IPinCH and a further five Special Initiatives have also been approved. The community initiatives address a broad range of pressing cultural heritage topics: 
*'''A Case of Access: Inuvialuit Engagement with the Smithsonian’s MacFarlane Collection'''

The MacFarlane Collection is a collection of 550 [[Inuvialuit]] items bought by [[Hudson’s Bay Company]] trader Roderick MacFarlane in the mid-1800s for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, David. Painted Wooden Plaques from the MacFarlane Collection: The Earliest Inuvialuit Graphic Art. ARCTIC VOL. 59, NO. 4 (DECEMBER 2006) P. 351– 360&lt;/ref&gt; Inuvialuit elders, youth, cultural experts, anthropologists and museum curators shared with one another their respective knowledge about the museum collection and documented the process. The project has encouraged interaction and engagement by the Inuvialuit with the objects in the MacFarlane Collection, supported by the creation of a [http://www.inuvialuitlivinghistory.ca/ virtual exhibit] and searchable archive of the collection. Additional details about the "A Case of Access" Community Initiative are available in the [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/project_components/community-based_initiatives/acaseofaccess_finalreport_2014.pdf full report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/project_components/community-based_initiatives/inuvialuit_project_summary_2014.pdf project summary], available on the IPinCH website.

*'''Cultural Tourism in Nunavik'''

In the early 1990s, the first few attempts at [[cultural tourism]] in [[Nunavik]] saw little success, but there is now support from businesses to include tourism as a facet of economic development. The [http://www.avataq.qc.ca/en/Home Avataq Cultural Institute], an IPinCH partner organization, has advocated the development of cultural tourism for some time, but Avataq sees a world’s difference between what it envisions as responsible development and certain economic interests’ vision for cultural tourism. This case study works with local communities to answer several key questions: What part do the Nunavimmiut really play in this development? Are they silent participants or, on the contrary, the driving force behind this development? One of the aims of the research is to re-centre the meaning of cultural tourism as a means of protecting [[Inuit culture]], possibly in tension with the Quebec government’s “[[Plan Nord]]” for Northern economic and tourism development.

*'''Developing Policies and Protocols for the Culturally Sensitive Intellectual Properties of the Penobscot Nation of Maine'''

Indigenous communities face legal, social, cultural, and economic challenges when attempting to protect or manage their intellectual property (IP), and often there is a lack of community infrastructure to formalize processes for confronting IP issues. To mitigate this challenge, the [[Penobscot|Penobscot Nation]] in Maine established an IP Working Group that developed tribal protocols, tools, and an internal infrastructure to address IP issues particularly related to archaeology and heritage-based places. This involved discussions around what constitutes Penobscot Nation intellectual property, what characterizes intellectual property violations (and how to deal with them), and identifying the community’s intellectual property priorities. The [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/penobscot_final_report_2014.pdf full project report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/penobscot_project_summary_2014.pdf project summary] are available on the IPinCH website.
*'''Education, Protection and Management of ''ezhibiigaadek asin'' (Sanilac Petroglyph Site)'''

For the [[Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation]] of Michigan, ''ezhibiigaadek asin'' is a sacred place where teachings from their Anishinabe ancestors are embedded in the rock as [[petroglyph]]s. Amidst concerns over the inappropriate use of the teachings, this case study explores issues around cultural commodification with the goal of working with the Saginaw Chippewa's Ziibiwing Cultural Society to create a plan to protect and control the use of the ''ezhibiigaadek asin'' site. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/ezhibiigaadek_asin_finalreport_2016.pdf project report] is available on the IPinCH website.

*'''Grassroots Resource Preservation and Management in Kyrgyzstan: Ethnicity, Nationalism and Heritage on a Human Scale'''

This case study began a public conversation among both urban and rural people about intellectual property and cultural heritage in [[Kyrgyzstan]], a post-Soviet nation where ties to the past have been attenuated and even severed. In Kyrgyzstan, local communities have little or no awareness of the heritage resources in their midst, and damage to sites is common. This case study had three components all with the shared goal of encouraging a national dialogue on cultural heritage and intellectual property. The first project involved developing a new foundation for an endangered archaeological structure. The second project focused on preserving oral traditions for younger generations of Kyrgyz, while the third initiative was centered on creating a photographic record of local archaeological sites.
*'''Moriori Cultural Database'''

Located on Rēkohu ([[Chatham Islands]], New Zealand), this project involved research and community-building related to [[Moriori people|Moriori]] identity, indigenous cultural heritage and resource management and protection. A key component of this study was the development of a multi-layer database to integrate research on Moriori identity, cultural heritage protection, land use, and resource management in culturally sensitive ways. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/moriori_final_report_2014.pdf project report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/moriori_project_summary_2014.pdf project summary] are available on the IPinCH website.

*'''Secwepemc Territorial Authority – Honoring Ownership of Tangible / Intangible Culture'''

This initiative brought together [[Secwepemc]] community leaders and knowledge holders from Neskonlith, Adams Lake, and Splats’in Bands of interior [[British Columbia]] with a group of social, legal, and political scholars. This community initiative will outline approaches to cultural heritage encounters within Secwepemc territory, examining what it would look like were we to fully accept and act upon the premise that Secwepemc Peoples’ have economic, political, and legal authority within their territory. At the heart of this project is a desire to develop fruitful scholarly and economic collaborations, while fully honouring Secwepemc peoples’ assertions of territorial authority.
* '''The History and Contemporary Practices of the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office'''
What are the differences between [[Hopi]] notions of ''navoti'' (“[[traditional knowledge]]”) and Euro-American understandings of intellectual property? What are the implications of this in terms of managing cultural knowledge resources? This case study is working towards developing an official cultural heritage management guide for the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office and the Hopi Tribe.

*'''The Journey Home - Guiding Intangible Knowledge Production in the Analysis of Ancestral Remains'''

In the Journey Home project, the question was not whether ancestral remains should be repatriated from the [[University of British Columbia]] Lab of Archaeology to the [[Sto:lo|Stó:lō Nation]], but rather how to do things right, regardless of timeframe. This study developed mutually acceptable guidelines for [[repatriation]], addressing complex questions related to the production of knowledge, authority, control, and ongoing relationships with ancestors. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/thejourneyhome_finalreport_2016.pdf project report] is available on the IPinCH website.
*'''The Ngaut Ngaut Interpretive Project: Providing Culturally Sustainable Online Interpretive Content to the Public'''

Indigenous groups around the world are struggling to come to terms with the issues that an online environment poses to the presentation of the Indigenous past and present. In this initiative, the Mannum Aboriginal Community Association Inc. countered offensive and incorrect online information about the Ngaut Ngaut heritage complex in [[South Australia]] by creating their own interpretive content in which they shared community perceptions and values about this significant cultural landscape. The [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3YUNheVwtsFcVRWQXNDbG5MNkE/view?pli=1 full project report] and an [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3YUNheVwtsFYm4wWndadjFRTTQ/view?pli=1 interpretive guide] for the Ngaut Ngaut site are available on the IPinCH website. 
*'''Treaty Relations as a Method of Resolving IP Issues'''

This case study examined the political relationship established between [[First Nations]] and Canada through historical [[Treaty|treaties]]. Did the treaty relationship include, either directly or indirectly, a shared understanding of how the cultural heritage of Indigenous peoples would be treated by Settlers and by the governments they established? How might this historical relationship serve Settler-First Nations relations today? Based on a careful examination of published primary and secondary materials related to treaty negotiations in central Ontario and the Northwest Territories, the study applies historical, oral-historical, and anthropological methods and attempts to identify aspects of these historic treaties which have resonance for current IP debates around topics such as property, ownership, and jurisdiction. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/treatyrelations_finalreport_2014.pdf project report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/treatyrelations_projectsummary_2014.pdf project summary] are available on the IPinCH website.
*'''Yukon First Nations Heritage Values and Heritage Resource Management'''

This community initiative seeks understandings of heritage values from three participating [[Yukon]] First Nations: the [[Champagne and Aishihik First Nations|Champagne &amp; Aishihik First Nations]], the [[Carcross/Tagish First Nation|Carcross-Tagish First Nation,]] and the [[Ta'an Kwach'an Council|Ta'an Kwach'än Council.]] This project will explore how the values of Yukon First Nations towards heritage resources differ from Western understandings, and will articulate and document what Indigenous heritage management practices look like on a practical level.

==Research Themes==
Integrating research findings and knowledge from our Community-Based Initiatives and other sources, the IPinCH Research Themes explore unique questions relating to intellectual property and heritage.  Each group is led by at least two team members, as Research Theme Co-Chairs. Membership in these groups is open to all associated students, partnering organization representatives, co-investigators, associates, collaborators, research assistants, steering committee members, and community representatives.
* '''Bioarchaeology, DNA, and Indigeneity'''
How is [[Genetics|genetic]] information being used to define—or redefine—identity, [[Ancestor|ancestry]], and diversity? What are the ensuing social, ethical, and practical implications of [[DNA]] research for descendent communities, First Nations peoples, and other stakeholders? What are the intersections of genetic and cultural identities? What can research examples such as that of [[Kwäday Dän Ts'ìnchi]] (Long Ago Person Found) or the [[Anzick-1|Clovis period child]] from the Anzick site teach us about moving forward with genetic studies through collaborative research? As archaeologists and anthropologists increasingly turn to genetic information to provide insights into the past, there are important implications for Indigenous peoples today. From genetic ancestry tests that purport to identify “Native American ancestry,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Native American DNA: Tribal Belonging and the False Promise of Genetic Science|last=TallBear|first=Kim|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Minnesota|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the potential application of [[ancient DNA analysis]] to assist with the [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains|repatriation]] of human remains, DNA is changing the way in which identity is constructed—both for ancient and present-day peoples. Research theme chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/daryl-pullman Daryl Pullman] (Memorial University), [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/alan-h-goodman Alan Goodman] (Hampshire College), and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/dorothy-lippert Dorothy Lippert] (Smithsonian Institution).
*'''Commodifications of Cultural Heritage'''
How can processes of commodification be both harmful and beneficial? What tools and strategies can Indigenous communities and scholars use to deal with commodification concerns and opportunities? This theme covers complex topics such as the role of government and legislation in regulating cultural commodification, whether commodification can benefit disempowered communities, and the impact of treating human remains as commodities, whether in medical science or museums. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/sven-ouzman Sven Ouzman] ([[University of Pretoria]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/associates/solen-roth Solen Roth] (University of British Columbia). 
*'''Community-Based Cultural Heritage Research (CBCHR)'''
[[Community-Based Participatory Research]] (CBPR) methods engage communities in all aspects of the research process. In IPinCH’s Community Initiatives, the communities determine the research goals, which form for the foundation for the initiative, including the practical and theoretical outputs. These IPinCH-supported initiatives may serve as positive examples of CBPR methods being put to use to investigate and address pressing cultural heritage needs. There is an ongoing need for background information and case studies to help students and scholars think through the implications of community-based work. This theme also amalgamates resources to help foster balanced and mutually beneficial relationships between academic and community researchers and promote fair and culturally-appropriate uses of intellectual property. Research theme chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/kelly-bannister Kelly Bannister] (University of Victoria), [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/julie-hollowell Julie Hollowell] (Indiana University), [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/ian-lilley Ian Lilley] (University of Queensland), and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/john-r-welch John R. Welch] (Simon Fraser University). 
*'''Cultural Tourism'''
The diversity of the world’s cultures, both past and present, is one of the key attractions of travel. Governments, the tourism industry, and communities work hard to create unforgettable cultural products and experiences. But are the economic benefits of these experiences shared equally with communities? Are they sustainable environmentally, are they culturally appropriate experiences to share, and do communities have control over how their culture is represented? These questions are at the heart of the ''Cultural Tourism'' research theme. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/lena-mortensen Lena Mortensen] (University of Toronto - Scarborough) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/david-schaepe David Schaepe] (Sto:lo Nation)
*'''Indigenous Peoples, Cultural Heritage, and the Law'''
The ''Indigenous Peoples, Cultural Heritage, and the Law'' Research Theme investigates the application of [[intellectual property law]] to the realm of cultural heritage, as well as alternative models to protect, promote, and maintain cultural and heritage goods. A number of legal systems coexist and often intersect with conventional intellectual property protections, including customary law, international law, informal or “vernacular” intellectual property, and moral economies. Many stakeholders thus face an inter-jurisdictional geography of cultural rights, consisting of [[indigenist]] social movements, NGOs, development agencies and institutions, multilateral institutions, and the [[Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples]]. This theme addresses these complex legal and political landscapes. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/rosemary-j-coombe Rosemary Coombe] ([[York University]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/associates/patricia-goff Patricia Goff] ([[Wilfrid Laurier University]], Ontario).
*'''Indigenous Research Ethics'''
The ''Indigenous Research Ethics'' theme explores the dynamic intersection of policies, procedures, practices, and philosophies of contemporary Indigenous research ethics. The research contained within this theme represents a useful resource for practitioners who grapple with intellectual property ethics and issues. Emphasis is placed upon the special demands and rewards of collaborative research practice. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/alison-wylie Alison Wylie] ([[University of Washington]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/sonya-atalay Sonya Atalay] ([[Indiana University]]).
* '''Safeguarding Indigenous Heritage'''
In 2014, the long-standing conflict over Grace Islet, off [[Salt Spring Island]], B.C., a well-documented [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] burial islet, reached a boiling point as construction began on a private residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/resources/declarations/open-letter-grace-islet|title=An Open Letter on Grace Islet|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/grace-islet-home-on-sacred-aboriginal-cemetery-to-be-demolished-1.3186534|title=Home on sacred B.C. aboriginal cemetery to be demolished|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following protests by First Nations, scholars, and members of the public, construction was halted and the province of British Columbia eventually purchased Grace Islet from the private landowner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/grace-islet-controversy-ends-as-b-c-steps-in-to-buy-land-1.2906882|title=Grace Islet burial site saved as province steps in|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IPinCH believes that the critical issue in the Grace Islet case is the absence of respect for First Nations laws, values, and practices relating to burial sites and ancestral remains, and the need for descendant communities to have a say in how their ancestral sites are managed and protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/resources/declarations/ancestral-burial-grounds|title=Declaration on the Safeguarding of Indigenous Ancestral Burial Grounds as Sacred Sites and Cultural Landscapes|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace Islet is one of many such cases in British Columbia and, indeed, around the world, that demonstrate the limited legal protections available to protect Indigenous burial grounds''.'' This research theme seeks to examine current challenges in protecting Indigenous ancestral burial sites within the province and to propose a new approach that meets the needs of all parties.

The '''''International Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods''''' ('''SEFM''') is an international academic conference in the field of [[software engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sefm.iist.unu.edu/history.html SEFM history], [[UNU-IIST]], [[United Nations University]], Macau.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
Until 2002, SEFM was a workshop; it then became a full international conference. It is sponsored by the [[IEEE Computer Society]]. The ''1st IEEE International Conferences on         Software Engineering and Formal Methods''  (SEFM 2003) was  held at [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]] in September 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sefm.iist.unu.edu/SEFM2003/ SEFM 2003], Brisbane, Australia, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Submissions originated from 22 different countries. As well as IEEE-CS, supporters for SEFM 2003 included the  [[Australian Computer Society]] (ACS), [[Boeing Australia]], and the [[Italy|Italian]] Embassy in [[Canberra]].

The proceedings for the conference are published by the [[Springer Science+Business Media]] in [[LNCS]] since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/search?query=SEFM&amp;facet-content-type=%22Book%22 SEFM Proceedings], [[SpringerLink]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the proceedings were published by [[IEEE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10529 SEFM 2005 Proceedings], [[IEEE Xplore]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
SEFM aims to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia, industry, and government, to advance the state of the art in [[formal methods]], to help in their large-scale application in the software industry, and to encourage their integration with other practical [[software engineering]] methods.

The conferences are often held in the [[Asia]] and [[Pacific]] regions and specifically in developing countries. An important aim of the SEFM conferences is to encourage research cooperation between developing countries and industrialized countries. SEFM 2010 was in [[Pisa]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sefm2010.isti.cnr.it/ SEFM 2010], [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|CNR]], Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; SEFM 2013 was in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://antares.sip.ucm.es/sefm2013/ | title=SEFM 2013 | publisher=[[Universidad Complutense]] | location=Madrid, Spain | accessdate=4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SEFM 2014 takes place in Grenoble, France &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEFM 2014|url=http://sefm2014.inria.fr/|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEFM conference series is included on the [[DBLP]] online publications database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/sefm/ Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods (SEFM)], [[DBLP]].&lt;/ref&gt; Revised selected papers sometimes appear as special journal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1007/s00165-013-0281-8 | first1=Jonathan P. | last1=Bowen | authorlink1=Jonathan Bowen | first2=Michael | last2=Butler | authorlink2=Michael Butler (computer scientist) | first3=Steve | last3=Reeves | authorlink3=Steve Reeves (computer scientist) | first4=Mike | last4=Hinchey | authorlink4=Michael Hinchey | title=Editorial | journal=[[Formal Aspects of Computing]] | volume=5 | page=343 | year=2013 }}&lt;!--| accessdate=3 June 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Amend 'preference' (which may be arbitrary) for 'discretion' (which in English is the term usually used for an exercise in principled legal judgment).</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6026">{{Usul al-fiqh}}
'''''{{transl|ar|DIN|Istiḥsan}}''''' ([[Arabic]]: {{wikt-lang|ar|اِسْتِحْسَان}}) is an Arabic term for juristic discretion. In its literal sense it means "to consider something good". [[Muslim]] scholars may use it to express their preference for particular judgements in  [[Sharia|Islamic law]] over other possibilities. It is one of the principles of legal thought underlying scholarly interpretation or [[ijtihad]].

A number of disputes existed amongst the classical jurists over this principle with the Hanafite jurists adopting this as a secondary source. Contemporary proponents of [[liberal movements within Islam]] have used ''istihsan'' and the similar idea of ''[[istislah]]'' (Arabic for "to deem proper") as ethical principles to favour feminist and reformist interpretations of the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah]], thus looking to reform [[Sharia|Islamic law]].

==Etymology==
''{{transl|ar|DIN|Istiḥsan}}'' ({{lang|ar|استحسان}} {{IPA-ar|istiħsaːn|}}) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word derived from the word ''al-husn'' ({{lang|ar|الحسن}}) which means good which is the opposite meaning of ''al-qubh'' ({{lang|ar|القبح}}) which means bad. The word ''{{transl|ar|DIN|istiḥsan}}'' is used to express "decorating or improving or considering something good".&lt;ref&gt;Mohd Hafiz Jamaludin and Ahmad Hidayat Buang "[http://www.dakwah.unisnu.ac.id/asset/webadmin/js/kcfinder/upload/files/Vol%201,%20No%201%20(2013)%20International%20Journal%20Of%20Nusantara%20Islam.pdf Syariah Courts in Malaysia and the Development of Islamic Jurisprudence: The Study of Istihsan]" International Journal of Nusantara Islam 1, no. 1 (2014): 2.{{ISSN|2252-5904}}. {{DOI| 10.15575/ijni.v1i1.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also applies to mean something towards which one is inclined or which one prefers, even if it is not approved by others.&lt;ref&gt;Nyazee, Islamic Jurisprudence, 2000, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;
Technically it has been defined in several ways by Muslim jurists:
* Bazdawi defines it as moving away from the implications of an analogy to an analogy that is stronger than it.&lt;ref name="Bazdawi"&gt;al-Bazdawi, Usul al-Bazdawi&lt;/ref&gt;
* Al-Halwani defines it as giving up an analogy for a stronger evidence from the [[Quran]], [[Sunnah]] or [[ijma]].&lt;ref name="Bazdawi"/&gt;
* The Maliki jurist, Ibn al-Arabi defines it as sacrificing some of the implications of an evidence by way of exception.&lt;ref name="Bazdawi"/&gt;
* Al-Karkhi defines Istihsan as follows: Istihsan is when one takes a decision on a certain case different from that on which similar cases have been decided on the basis of its precedents, for a reason which is stronger than one found in similar cases and which requires departure from those cases.&lt;ref&gt;Saim Kayadibi, ''Doctrine of Istihsan (Juristic Preference) in Islamic Law'', (Konya: Tablet Kitabevi, 2007), 104. {{ISBN|978-975-6346-79-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Istihsan==
A number of categorisations have been employed by the jurists:
* Istihsan through the text ([[Nass (Islam)|nass]])
* Istihsan on the basis of consensus ([[ijma]])
* Istihsan on the basis of what is good ([[maruf (Islam)|maruf]])
* Istihsan on the basis of necessity ([[darurah]])
* Istihsan on the basis of benefit ([[Maslahah]])
* Istihsan on the basis of analogy ([[qiyas khafi]])

==Examples of Istihsan==
The following comprise classical examples for this principle:
* Abu Hanifah stated that the one who eats out of forgetfulness whilst fasting should repeat the fast - however he moves away from this by the evidence of a narration that allows the fast to stand.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Abd al-Aziz al-Bukhari, Kash al-Asrar, Vol 4,7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Analogy requires that the manufacturing contract with advance payment be prohibited on the basis of analogy - however this is made permissible according to [[ijma]].
* Analogy requires that pure water be used for ablution so wells in which dirt or carcasses of animals have fallen would be prohibited for use according to strict analogy. Necessity exceptionalises this and permits the use of this water provided formal cleaning methods are applied first.

==Criticisms==
[[Al-Shafi'i]] viewed the practice of juristic preference as a heretical usurping [[God in Islam|God]]'s sole right as the legislator of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Shafi'i]], [[Kitab al-Umm]], vol. 7, pg. 309-320. [[Cairo]] Dar al-fikr, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged that this criticism revolves more around the linguistic meaning of the term rather than its technical meaning,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; though modern scholarship regards Shafi'is comments as a direct criticism of the technical meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard G. Weiss]], ''The Search for God's Law: Islamic Jurisprudence in the Writings of Sayf al-Din al-Amidi'', pg. 672. [[Salt Lake City]]: [[University of Utah Press]], 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malik ibn Anas]] is noted to have been asked about binding divorce. When he delivered his response, a disciple of his quickly reached for a tablet to make note of this ruling. Upon realizing what his disciple was doing, Malik asked him to stop, remarking that his opinion could change before nightfall.&lt;ref&gt;Virani, Shafique N. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarakhsi points out that some jurists have criticised Istihsan on the grounds that the analogy is being given up for personal opinion, something prohibited in Islam. He refutes this understanding as incomprehensible, as no jurist would give up an authority for something that lacked evidence.&lt;ref&gt;al-Sarakhsi, Kitab al-Usul&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the co-founder and the first President (1960–1971) of the [[World Academy of Art and Science]] (WAAS).{{sfn|Cuthbertson|2007|pp=1–5}}{{sfn|ODNB|2004}}&lt;ref name="npg"&gt;{{NPG name|id=08505|name=John Boyd Orr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and family background ==
[[File:Boydorrshouse.JPG|left|thumb|200px|The birthplace of John Boyd Orr: Holland Green, Fenwick Road, Kilmaurs.]]
John Boyd Orr was born at [[Kilmaurs]], near [[Kilmarnock]], [[East Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]], the middle child in a family of seven children. His father, Robert Clark Orr, was a quarry owner, and a man of deep religious convictions, being a member of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]. His mother, Annie Boyd, was the daughter of another quarry master, wealthier than Robert Orr, and grandmaster of a [[Masonic Lodge|Freemason's Lodge]].

The family home was well supplied with books, and his father was widely read in political, sociological and metaphysical subjects, as well as religion. As he grew older, John would regularly discuss these subjects with his father, brothers, and visiting friends.{{efn|Kay is silent on whether his mother and sisters were also involved in these discussions}} There was also family worship each evening.

When John was five years old, the family suffered a setback when a ship owned by Robert Orr was lost at sea. They had to sell their home in Kilmaurs, and moved to [[West Kilbride]], a village on the [[North Ayrshire]] coast. According to Kay, the new house and environment were a great improvement on Kilmaurs, despite the family's reduced means. The major part of his upbringing took place in and around West Kilbride. He attended the village school until he was thirteen. Religion was then an important part of junior education in Scotland, and the school gave him a good knowledge of the [[Bible]], which stayed with him for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=44}}

At the age of thirteen, John won a bursary to [[Kilmarnock Academy]], a significant achievement as such bursaries were then rare. The new school was some {{convert|20|mi|km}} from his home in West Kilbride, but his father owned a quarry about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) from the Academy, and John was provided with accommodation nearby. His family cut short his education at the Academy because he was spending too much time in the company of the quarry workers (where he picked up a "wonderful vocabulary of swear words"),{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=44}} and after four months he returned to the village school in West Kilbride where he continued his education until he was seventeen under the inspirational tutelage of Headmaster John G. Lyons. There he became a pupil teacher at a salary of £10 for the first year, and £20 for the second. This was a particularly demanding time for the young Boyd Orr, as in addition to his teaching duties, and studying at home for his university and teacher-training qualifications, he also had to work every day in his father's business.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=44}}

After four years as a pupil teacher, at the age of 19 he won a Queen's Scholarship to study at a teacher training college in [[Glasgow]], plus a bursary which paid for his lodgings there. At the same time he entered a three-year degree course in [[theology]]{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2007}}{{efn|but theology may or may not have been the subject in which he received his M.A. degree}} at the [[University of Glasgow|University]], for which the fees were also covered.

== First encounters with poverty ==
As an undergraduate in Glasgow, he explored the interior of the city, usually at weekends. He was shocked by what he found in the poverty-stricken slums and tenements, which then made up a large part of the city. [[Rickets]] was obvious among the children, malnutrition (in some cases, associated with drunkenness) was shown by many of the adults, and many of the aged were destitute. In his first teaching job after graduating [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|M.A.]] in 1902, he was posted to a school in the slums. His first class was overcrowded, and the children ill-fed or actually hungry, inadequately clothed, visibly lousy and physically wretched. He resigned after a few days, realising that he could not teach children in such a condition, and that there was nothing he could do to relieve their misery.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=46}}

After working for a few months in his father's business, he taught for three years at Kyleshill School in [[Saltcoats]], also a poor area, but less squalid than the slums of [[Glasgow]].

== Return to university ==
Boyd Orr needed to augment his teacher's salary, and decided to do so by instructing an evening class in book-keeping and accountancy. After intensive study he passed the necessary examinations, and duly instructed his class. The knowledge and skills he learned by studying for, and teaching, this class were to prove very useful in his later career.

However his heart was not in teaching, and after fulfilling his teaching obligations under the terms of his Queen's Scholarship, he returned to the University to study [[biology]], a subject he had always been interested in since childhood. As a precaution, he entered simultaneously for a degree in [[medicine]].

He found the university to be a very stimulating environment. [[Diarmid Noel Paton]] (son of the artist [[Joseph Noel Paton]]) was Regius Professor of Physiology, and [[Edward Provan Cathcart]] head of [[Physiological chemistry|Physiological Chemistry]], both men of outstanding scientific ability. He was impressed by Samuel Gemmill, Professor of Clinical Medicine, a philosopher whose deep thinking on social affairs also influenced Boyd Orr's approach to such questions.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=46}}

Half-way through his medical studies, his savings ran out. Reluctant to ask his family for support, he bought a block of tenanted flats on mortgage, with the help of a bank overdraft, and used the rents to pay for the rest of his studies. On graduating, he sold the property for a small profit.

He graduated [[B.Sc.]] in 1910, and [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|M.B. Ch.B.]] in 1912, at the age of 32, placing sixth in a year of 200 students. Two years later, in 1914, he graduated [[Doctor of Medicine#UK, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries|M.D.]] with honours, receiving the Bellahouston Gold Medal for the most distinguished thesis of the year.

== Research career ==
On leaving the university, he took a position as a ship's surgeon on a ship trading between Scotland and West Africa, choosing this job because it offered the possibility of paying off his bank overdraft faster than any other. He resigned after four months, when he had repaid the debt. He then tried general practice, working as a ''[[locum]]'' in the practice of his family doctor in [[Saltcoats]], and was offered a partnership there. Realising that a career in medicine was not for him, he instead accepted the offer of a two-year Carnegie research scholarship, to work in [[Edward Provan Cathcart|E.P. Cathcart]]'s laboratory. The work he began there covered [[malnutrition]], [[protein]]{{sfn|Cathcart|Orr|1914|pp=113–127}} and [[creatine]]{{sfn|Cathcart|Boyd Orr|1914|pp=xxi–xxii}}{{sfn|Boyd Orr|1914}} [[metabolism]], the effect of water intake on [[nitrogenous]] metabolism in humans,{{sfn|Boyd Orr|Burns|1914}}{{sfn|Orr|1914|pp=530–540}} and the energy expenditure of military recruits in training.{{sfn|Boyd Orr|Cathcart|1919}}

=== The beginnings of the Rowett Research Institute ===
On 1 April 1914, Boyd Orr took charge of a new research institute in [[Aberdeen]], a project of a joint committee for research into animal nutrition of the [[Scottish Agricultural College|North of Scotland College of Agriculture]] and [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen University]]. He had been offered the post on the recommendation of E.P. Cathcart, who had originally been offered the job, but had turned it down in favour of a chair in [[physiology]] in [[University of London|London]].

The joint committee had allocated a budget of £5,000 for capital expenditure and £1,500 for annual running costs. Boyd Orr recognised immediately that these sums were inadequate. Using his experience in his father's business of drawing up plans and estimating costs, he submitted a budget of £50,000 for capital expenditure and £5,000 for annual running costs. Meanwhile, with the £5,000 he had already been allocated he specified a building, not of wood as had been envisaged by the committee, but of granite and designed so that it could serve as a wing of his proposed £50,000 Institute. He accepted the lowest tender of £5,030, and told the contractors to begin work immediately. The committee were not pleased, but had to accept the ''[[fait accompli]]''. When war broke out the contractors were told to finish the walls and roof, but to do no more for the time being.

=== War service ===
On the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] he was given leave to join the [[British Army]], and asked his former colleague Cathcart to help him obtain a medical commission in an infantry unit overseas. Cathcart thought he would be more useful at home, and his first commission was in a special civilian section of the [[Royal Army Medical Corps|R.A.M.C.]] dealing with sanitation. Several divisions of non-conscripted recruits were in training in emergency camps at home, some of them in very poor sanitary conditions. Boyd Orr was able to push through schemes for improvement in hygiene, preventing much sickness.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=49}}

After 18 months he was posted as [[Medical officer|Medical Officer]] to an infantry unit, the [[The Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)|1st Sherwood Foresters]]. He spent much of his time in shell holes, patching up the many wounded. His courage under fire and devotion to duty were recognised by the award of a [[Military Cross]] after the [[Battle of the Somme]], and of the [[Distinguished Service Order]] after [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]]. He also made arrangements for the battalion's diet to be supplemented by vegetables collected from local deserted gardens and fields. As a result, unlike other units, he did not need to send any of the men in his medical charge to hospital. He also prevented his men getting [[trench foot]] by personally ensuring they were fitted with boots a size larger than usual.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=49}}

Worried that he was losing touch with medical and nutritional advances, he asked to be transferred to the [[Royal Navy|navy]], where he thought he would have more time available for reading and research. The army was reluctant to let him go, but agreed, since he was still a civilian surgeon. He spent a busy three months in the naval hospital at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]], studying hard while practicing medicine in the wards, before being posted to [[HMS Furious (47)|HMS ''Furious'']]. On board ship his medical duties were light, enabling him to do a great deal of reading. He was later recalled to work studying food requirements of the army.

=== Post-war expansion of the Rowett Research Institute ===
When Boyd Orr returned to Aberdeen in early 1919, his plan for a larger Institute had still not been accepted. Indeed, even his plans for the annual maintenance grant had to be approved by the Professor of Agriculture in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], Thomas Barlow Wood. Despite gaining the latter's support, his expansion plans were at first rebuffed, although he succeeded in having the annual grant increased to £4,000. In 1920 he was introduced to [[John Quiller Rowett]], a businessman who seemed to have qualms of conscience{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=51}} over the large profits he had made during the war. Shortly afterwards, the government agreed to finance half the cost of Boyd Orr's plan, provided he could raise the other half elsewhere. Rowett agreed to provide £10,000 for the first year, £10,000 for the second year, and gave an additional £2,000 for the purchase of a farm, provided that, "if any work done at the Institute on animal nutrition was found to have a bearing on human nutrition, the Institute would be allowed to follow up this work",{{sfn|RRI|2005}} a condition the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] was willing to accept. By September 1922 the buildings were nearly completed, and the renamed [[Rowett Research Institute]] was opened shortly thereafter by [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=52}}

Boyd Orr proved to be an effective fund-raiser from both government and private sources,{{sfn|Smith|1998|pp=47–63}} expanding the experimental farm to around {{convert|1000|acre|km2}}, building a well-endowed library, and expanding the buildings. He also built a centre for accommodating students and scientists attracted by the Institute's growing reputation, a reputation enhanced by Boyd Orr's many publications.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=54}} His research output suffered from the time and energy he had to devote to fund-raising, and in later life he said, "I still look with bitter resentment at having to spend half my time in the humiliating job of hunting for money for the Institute."{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=52}}

Through the 1920s, his own research was devoted mainly to animal nutrition, his focus changed to human nutrition both as a researcher and an active lobbyist and propagandist for improving people's diets. In 1927, he proved the value of milk being supplied to school children, which led to free school milk provision in the UK. His 1936 report "Food, Health and Income" showed that at least one third of the UK population were so poor that they could not afford to buy sufficient food to provide a healthy diet and revealed that there was a link between low-income, malnutrition and under-achievement in schools.{{sfn|UoG}}

From 1929 to 1944, Boyd Orr was Consultant Director to the Imperial Bureau of Animal Nutrition, later the Commonwealth Bureau of Nutrition (part of the [[CAB International|Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux]]), which was based at the Rowett Research Institute. During the Second World War he was a member of Churchill's Scientific Committee on Food Policy and helped to formulate food rationing{{sfn|UoG}}

== International and political work ==
In October 1945, Orr was elected [[Rector of the University of Glasgow]] after standing as an Independent Progressive candidate.{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 22 Oct|1945|p=4}} He was elected as an independent [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[Combined Scottish Universities (UK Parliament constituency)|Combined Scottish Universities]] in a [[Combined Scottish Universities by-election, 1945|by-election in April 1945]],{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 14 Apr|1945|p=10}} and kept his seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|general election]] shortly after. He [[resignation from the British House of Commons|resigned]] in 1946.{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 4 Oct|1946|p=4}}

After the [[Second World War]], Boyd Orr resigned from the Rowett Institute, and took several posts, most notably as Director-General of the United Nations' new Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 28 Oct|1945|p=3}}{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 1 Dec|1945|p=2}} Although his tenure in this position was short (1945–1948), he worked not only to alleviate the immediate postwar food shortage through the International Emergency Food Committee (IEFC) but also to propose comprehensive plans for improving food production and its equitable distribution—his proposal to create a World Food Board.  Although the board failed to get the support of Britain and the US, Boyd Orr laid a firm foundation for the new U.N. specialized agency.{{sfn|Staples|2006|pp=78–96}}{{sfn|Staples|2003|pp=495–523}}

He then resigned from the FAO and became director of a number of companies and proved a canny investor in the stock market, making a considerable personal fortune.  When he received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1949,{{efn|The [[American Friends Service Committee]] was one of his nominators for the Nobel Prize.{{sfn|AFSC Nobel Nominations}}}} he donated the entire financial award to organizations devoted to world peace and a united world government.
He was elevated to the peerage in 1949 as '''Baron Boyd Orr''', of Brechin Mearns in the County of Angus.{{sfn|Kay|1972|pp=43–81}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=38558 |date=11 March 1949 |page=1264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 Boyd Orr was elected the first president of the [[World Academy of Art and Science]], which was set up by eminent scientists of the day concerned about the potential misuse of scientific discoveries, most especially nuclear weapons.

The [[University of Glasgow]] has a [[Boyd Orr Building]] and the Boyd Orr Centre for Population and Ecosystem Health{{sfn|Boyd Orr Centre}} named after him, and the University's [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]] holds his Nobel medal. There is a street named after Boyd Orr in his home town of Kilmaurs in Ayrshire, as well as in [[Brechin]], Angus, [[Penicuik]], Midlothian, and in [[Saltcoats]], Ayrshire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2171">The '''Levitin effect''' refers to the phenomenon, first documented by Dr. [[Daniel J. Levitin]] in 1994, that people – even those without musical training – tend to remember [[song]]s in the correct [[key (music)|key]]. The finding stood in contrast to the large body of laboratory literature suggesting that such details of perceptual experience are lost during the process of [[memory]] encoding. In other words, laboratory experiments supported the idea that most people are incapable of any sort of [[absolute pitch]], and thus would remember melodies with [[relative pitch]].

In the [[Linguistics|study of language]], '''description''' or '''descriptive linguistics''' is the work of [[Objectivity (science)|objectively]] analyzing and describing how [[language]] is actually used (or how it was used in the past) by a group of people in a speech community.

All academic research in [[linguistics]] is descriptive; like all other scientific disciplines, its aim is to describe the reality as it is, without the bias of preconceived ideas about how it ought to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kordić|first=Snježana|authorlink=Snježana Kordić|year=2010|language=Serbo-Croatian|title=Jezik i nacionalizam|trans-title=Language and Nationalism|url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf|series=Rotulus Universitas|location=Zagreb|publisher=Durieux|page=60|isbn=978-953-188-311-5|lccn=2011520778|oclc=729837512|ol=15270636W|id={{COBISS|13436977}}|archivedate= 8 July 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/690BiBe4T?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/475567.Jezik_i_nacionalizam.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2015|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Moch.

Linguistic description is often contrasted with [[linguistic prescription]], which is found especially in [[education]] and in [[publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Lawrence Trask|title=Key Concepts in Language and Linguistics|pages=47-48|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EE4dhRzavEgC|isbn=9780415157414|lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nils Langer|title=Linguistic Purism in Action: How auxiliary tun was stigmatized in Early New High German|year=2013|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110881103|pages=223|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IZUiAAAAQBAJ|lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescription seeks to define standard language forms and give advice on effective language use, and can be thought of as a presentation of the fruits of descriptive research in a learnable form, though it also draws on more subjective aspects of language aesthetics. Prescription and description are complementary, but have different priorities and sometimes are seen to be in conflict. Description is sometimes distinguished from "descriptivism", which is then defined as the belief that description is more significant or important to teach, study, and practice than prescription.

==Description==
As English-linguist Larry Andrews describes it, descriptive grammar is the linguistic approach that studies what a language is like, as opposed to prescriptive, which declares what a language should be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Larry|title=Language Exploration and Awareness: A Resource Book for Teachers|date=2006|publisher=Lawrence Earlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-4308-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, descriptive grammarians focus analysis on how all sorts of people in all sorts of environments, usually in more casual, everyday settings, communicate, while prescriptive grammarians focus on the grammatical rules and structures predetermined by linguistic registers and figures of power for those who are under the control of said authorities to use. An example Andrews uses in his book is ''fewer than'' vs ''less than''.&lt;ref name="Andrews-26"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Larry|title=Language Exploration and Awareness: A Resource Book for Teachers|date=2006|publisher=Lawrence Earlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ|isbn=0-8058-4308-6|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A descriptive grammarian would state that both statements are correct, as long as the receiver of the message can understand the meaning behind the statement. A prescriptive grammarian, on the other hand, would analyze the rules and conventions behind the statements made and determine which statement is correct according to those rules. Andrews also believes that although the majority of linguists would be descriptive grammarians, the majority of public school teachers tend to be prescriptive.&lt;ref name="Andrews-26" /&gt;

==Challenges==
Accurate description of real speech is a difficult problem, and linguists have often been reduced to approximations. Almost all linguistic theory has its origin in practical problems of descriptive linguistics. [[Phonology]] (and its theoretical developments, such as the [[phoneme]]) deals with the function and interpretation of sound in language. [[Syntax]] has developed to describe the rules concerning how words relate to each other in order to form sentences. [[Lexicology]] collects "words" and their derivations and transformations: it has not given rise to much generalized theory.

An extreme "mentalist" viewpoint denies that the linguistic description of a language can be done by anyone but a competent speaker. Such speakers have internalized something called "[[linguistic competence]]", which gives them the ability to extrapolate correctly from their experience new but correct expressions, and to reject expressions which do not convey meaning in the way the speaker intends. For example, an expression could be [[ambiguous]], possibly leading to several different interpretations by the listener. Depending on the speaker's intent, ambiguity can be desirable (as in [[joke]]s and other [[humor]]) or not. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A linguistic description is considered descriptively adequate if it achieves one or more of the following goals of descriptive linguistics:
# A description of the [[phonology]] of the language in question.
# A description of the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of words belonging to that language.
# A description of the [[syntax]] of well-formed sentences of that language.
# A description of [[Derivation (linguistics)|lexical derivation]].
# A documentation of the [[vocabulary]], including at least one thousand entries.
# A reproduction of a few genuine texts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6834">The '''Mappae clavicula''' is a medieval Latin text containing manufacturing recipes for crafts materials, including for metals, glass, mosaics, and dyes and tints for materials. The information and style in the recipes is very terse. Each recipe consists of the names of the ingredients and typically about two sentences on combining the ingredients together. A small minority of the recipes go to about six sentences. The text comes with a short preamble, and other than that it is just recipes. The number of recipes was expanded over the course of the medieval centuries, and some medieval copies have deletions as well as additions, so it is better thought of as a family of texts with a largely common core, not a single text. Most of the ''Mappae Clavicula'' recipes are also in medieval Latin in a text known as the ''Compositiones ad Tingenda'' (English: "Recipes for Coloring (or Tingeing)").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2848238 "Notes on Some Manuscripts of the ''Mappae Clavicula''"], by Rozelle P. Johnson, year 1935. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/226251 A Review of ''Compositiones variae'' from Codex 490, Biblioteca Capitolare], by Lynn White, year 1940. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rB3cIVVq-YUC&amp;pg=PA32 ''Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture''], by William Eamon, year 1996, pages 32-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and accretion ==
The core was probably originally compiled around AD 600, perhaps in [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, in Greek. The core contains items traceable to earlier Alexandrian Greek texts, particularly the [[Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis|Stockholm papyrus]] and [[Leyden papyrus X|Leiden Papyrus X]], which are Greek texts dated to the 2nd or 3rd century AD that contain some of the same and similar recipes. The first few recipes in the Phillipps-Corning manuscript&lt;ref name=PhillippsCorning /&gt; of the ''Mappae clavicula'' were long considered integral, but they form a distinct separate entity,  the ''De coloribus et mixtionibus'', which survives (in whole or in part) in at least 62 manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;Clarke, M. (2001) ''The Art of All Colours: Mediaeval Recipe Books for Painters and Illuminators''. London: Archetype Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the Latin ''Mappae clavicula'' is very likely a translation of a Greek text, although the original Greek text (if it existed) does not exist today.

The best manuscripts of the ''Mappae clavicula'' date from the eighth to the twelfth century.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. S. and J. G. Hawthorne (1974) ‘Mappae Clavicula: A Little Key to the World of Medieval Techniques’, ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society: Held at Philadelphia for promoting useful knowledge'' (new series) 64 (4) [occupies whole issue].&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the fullest collections of recipes is in a certain manuscript dated late 12th century in which about 300 recipes are presented. In this manuscript, called the Phillipps-Corning manuscript, some of the names for some materials are Arabic names (e.g. ''alquibriz'' from the Arabic for sulphur, ''atincar'' from the Arabic for borax, ''alcazir'' from the Arabic for tin).&lt;ref name=PhillippsCorning&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/archaeologiaormi32sociuoft#page/187/mode/1up ''Mappae clavicula'' from a 12th-century manuscript], text published in Latin by Thomas Phillipps in year 1847. The original manuscript that Thomas Phillipps possessed, dated late 12th century, is now in the hands of the Corning Museum of Glass. Hence it is referred to as "the Phillipps-Corning manuscript". A digital image of it is downloadable at the [http://www.cmog.org/library/manuscript-mappae-clavicula Corning Museum of Glass, MS 5].&lt;/ref&gt; The recipes containing the Arabic names are historically later, and are in all likelihood no earlier than the 12th century. Certain earlier manuscripts have about 200 recipes.

The  principal manuscripts are:
* The ''Lucca MS'', Lucca, Biblioteca Capitolare Feliniana, Codex 490, the oldest witness, c. 800.
* The Sélestat MS, Sélestat, Bibliothèque Humaniste, MS 17. A very full yet old witness, early ninth century.
* The ''Codex Matritensis'' ('Madrid codex'), Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, MS A.16 (Was: MS A.19), c. 1130.
* The Phillipps-Corning Manuscript, Corning Museum of Glass, MS 5, late twelfth century.&lt;ref name=PhillippsCorning /&gt;

These  are simply among the fullest [[Textual criticism|witnesses]] - there are dozens more that preserve extracts.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

== Title ==
The title, ''Mappae clavicula'', is absurd, translating approximately as 'the little key to the small cloth'. The best explanation is that it is a mis-translation from a Greek original, in which χειρόκμητον ''kheirókmēton'' ('knack' or 'trick of the trade') was mis-read as χειρόμακτρον ''kheirómaktron'' ('hand-towel').&lt;ref&gt;Robert Halleux, 'Recettes d'artisan, recettes d'alchimiste', in: R. Jansen-Sieben (ed.) ''Artes mechanicae'', Archives et bibliothèques de Belgique, no. spécial 34 (Brussels, 1989), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the observation that certain recipes derive from the Greek technical papyri, the [[Leyden papyrus X]] and the [[Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis|Stockholm papyrus]].

A '''Marine pump''' is a [[pump]] which is used on board a vessel ([[ship]]) or an [[Oil platform|offshore platform]].

==Upper category==
It is a kind of general equipment, usually driven by an electrical motor, refer to [[pump]] category.

It is widely used as a machine in marine industry, refer to [[marine industry]] category.

==General==
A pump is a device that moves fluids ([[liquids]] or [[gases]]), or sometimes [[slurries]], by mechanical action. A marine pump is an important auxiliary equipment in marine industry and [[ship building]] industry. It is widely used in all kinds of marine vessels, such as [[barges]], [[Tug-boat|tug boats]], containers, [[Aircraft carrier|carriers]], ships, vessels, fixed offshore structure, drilling [[jack-up rig]]s and so on.

These marine pumps can be serviced for cooling, circulating, ballast, general service(G/S), [[fire-fighting]], boiler feed water, condensate water, fresh(drinking) water, sanitary water, [[bilge]] &amp; [[sludge]], [[Fuel oil|F.O.]] transfer, L.O. transfer, F.O. and F.S. cargo pumping, cargo stripping, [[hydrophone]] tank unit, sewage treatment unit, oil water separator, [[incinerator]], [[fresh water]] generator, and so on.

==Type==
Marine pump is named by its usage or application, it covers a lot of types of pumps, such as:

Marine [[centrifugal pump]] is used to transport fluids by the conversion of rotational kinetic energy to the hydrodynamic energy of the fluid flow. The rotational energy typically comes from an engine or electric motor. The fluid enters the pump impeller along or near to the rotating axis and is accelerated by the impeller, flowing radially outward into a diffuser or [[volute]] chamber (casing), from where it exits.

[[gear pump]], A marine gear pump uses the meshing of gears to pump fluid by displacement. They are one of the most common types of pumps for hydraulic fluid power applications. Gear pumps are also widely used in chemical installations to pump high viscosity fluids. There are two main variations; external gear pumps which use two external spur gears, and internal gear pumps which use an external and an internal [[spur gears]] (internal spur gear teeth face inwards, see below). Gear pumps are [[Positive displacement pump|positive displacement]] (or fixed displacement), meaning they pump a constant amount of fluid for each revolution. Some gear pumps are designed to function as either a motor or a pump.

[[screw pump]], A marine screw is a positive-displacement (PD) pump that use one or several screws to move fluids or solids along the screw(s) axis. In its simplest form (the Archimedes' screw pump), a single screw rotates in a cylindrical cavity, thereby moving the material along the screw's spindle.

[[File:Eye iris.jpg|thumb|alt="a human eye"|The naked eye]]

'''Naked eye''', also called '''bare eye''' or '''unaided eye''', is the practice of engaging in [[visual perception]] unaided by a [[magnification|magnifying]] or [[Optical telescope#Light-gathering power|light-collecting]] [[optical instrument]], such as a [[telescope]] or [[microscope]]. Vision corrected to normal [[visual acuity|acuity]] using [[corrective lens]]es is still considered "naked".

In [[astronomy]], the naked eye may be used to observe [[celestial event]]s and [[astronomical object|objects]] visible without equipment, such as [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]]s, passing [[comet]]s, [[meteor shower]]s, and the brightest [[asteroid]]s, including [[4 Vesta]]. Sky lore and various tests demonstrate an impressive variety of phenomena visible to the unaided eye.

==Basic accuracies==

==Naked eye in astronomy==
[[File:Light pollution country versus city.png|thumb|right|370px|A photographic approximation of a naked eye view of the [[night sky]] from a small rural town (top) and a [[metropolitan area]] (bottom). [[Light pollution]] dramatically reduces the visibility of [[star]]s.]]
The visibility of astronomical objects is strongly affected by [[light pollution]]. Even a few hundred kilometers away from a metropolitan area where the sky can appear to be very dark, it is still the residual light pollution that sets the limit on the visibility of faint objects. For most people, these are likely to be the best observing conditions within their reach. Under such "typical" dark sky conditions, the naked eye can see stars with an [[apparent magnitude]] up to +6&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;. Under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent, stars as faint as +8&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; might be visible.&lt;ref name="Bortle"/&gt;

The angular resolution of the naked eye is about 1&amp;prime;; however, some people have sharper vision than that. There is anecdotal evidence that people had [[Galilean moon#Visibility|seen]] the Galilean [[Jupiter's natural satellites|moons of Jupiter]] before telescopes were invented.&lt;ref&gt;Zezong, Xi, "The Discovery of Jupiter's Satellite Made by Gan De 2000 years Before Galileo", ''Chinese Physics'' 2 (3) (1982): 664–67.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uranus]] and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] had most probably been seen but could not be recognized as planets because they appear so faint even at maximum brightness; Uranus' magnitude varies from +5.3&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; to +5.9&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;, and Vesta's from +5.2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; to +8.5&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; (so that it is only visible near its opposition dates). Uranus, when discovered in 1781, was the first planet discovered using [[technology]] (a [[telescope]]) rather than being spotted by the naked eye.

Theoretically, in a typical dark sky, the [[Adaptation (eye)|dark adapted]] human eye would see the about 5,600 stars brighter than +6&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="SIMBAD-mag6"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vmag&lt;6 |publisher=SIMBAD Astronomical Database |url=http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-sam?Criteria=Vmag%3C6 |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in perfect dark sky conditions about 45,000 stars brighter than +8&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; might be visible.&lt;ref name = "Bortle"&gt;{{cite web|date = February 2001|title = The Bortle Dark-Sky Scale|publisher = [[Sky &amp; Telescope]]|author = John E. Bortle|url = http://www.skyandtelescope.com/resources/darksky/3304011.html|accessdate = 2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the atmospheric [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] and dust reduces this number somewhat. In the center of a city, where the naked-eye limiting magnitude due to extreme amounts of light pollution can be as low as 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;, with as few as 50 stars visible. Colors can be seen but this is limited by the fact that the eye uses [[Photoreceptor cell|rods instead of cones]] to view fainter stars.

The visibility of diffuse objects such as [[star cluster]]s and galaxies is much more strongly affected by light pollution than is that of planets and stars. Under typical dark conditions only a few such objects are visible. These include the [[Pleiades]], [[Double cluster|h/&amp;chi; Persei]], the [[Andromeda galaxy]], the [[Carina Nebula]], the [[Orion Nebula]], [[Omega Centauri]], [[47 Tucanae]], the Ptolemy Cluster [[Messier 7]] near the tail of [[Scorpius]] and the [[Messier Object 13|globular cluster M13]] in [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]]. The [[Triangulum Galaxy|Triangulum Galaxy (M33)]] is a difficult [[averted vision]] object and only visible at all if it is higher than 50° in the sky. The globular clusters [[Messier 3|M 3]] in [[Canes Venatici]] and [[Messier 92|M 92]] in Hercules are also visible with the naked eye under such conditions. Under really dark sky conditions, however, M33 is easy to see, even in direct vision. Many other [[Messier objects]] are also visible under such conditions.&lt;ref name = "Bortle"/&gt; The most distant objects that have been seen by the naked eye are nearby bright galaxies such as [[Centaurus A]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astronomy-mall.com/Adventures.In.Deep.Space/aintno.htm|title=Aintno Catalog|author=|date=|website=astronomy-mall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bode's Galaxy]],&lt;ref&gt;SEDS, [http://messier.seds.org/m/m081.html Messier 81]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "omeara1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

[[Classical planet|Five planets]] can be recognized as planets from [[Earth]] with the naked eye: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Under typical dark sky conditions [[Uranus]] (magnitude +5.8) can be seen as well with averted vision, as can the asteroid [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] at its brighter oppositions. The Sun and the Moon—the remaining noticeable naked-eye objects of the solar system—are sometimes added to make seven "planets." During daylight only the [[Moon]] and [[Sun]] are obvious naked eye objects, but in many cases [[Venus]] can be spotted in daylight and in  rarer cases [[Jupiter]]. Close to sunset and sunrise bright stars like [[Sirius]] or even [[Canopus]] can be spotted with the naked eye as long as one knows the exact position in which to look.
Historically, the zenith of naked-eye astronomy was the work of [[Tycho Brahe]] (1546–1601). He built an extensive observatory to make precise measurements of the heavens without any instruments for magnification. In 1610, [[Galileo Galilei]] pointed a [[telescope]] towards the sky. He immediately discovered the [[Galilean moons|moons of Jupiter]] and the [[Planetary phase|phases]] of [[Venus]], among other things.

Meteor showers are better observed by naked eye than with binoculars. Such showers include the [[Perseids]] (10–12 August) and the December [[Geminids]]. Some 100 [[satellite]]s per night, the [[International Space Station]] and the [[Milky Way]] are other popular objects visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hurtlingrock.com/naked-eye-astronomy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921050820/http://www.hurtlingrock.com/naked-eye-astronomy.html |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space, geodesy and navigation==
Many other things can be estimated without an instrument. If an arm is stretched the span of the hand corresponds to an angle of 18 to 20°. The distance of a person, just covered up by the outstretched thumbnail, is about 100 meters. The vertical can be estimated to about 2° and, in the northern hemisphere, observing the [[Pole Star]] and using a protractor can give the observer's geographic [[latitude]], up to 1 degree of accuracy.

The [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Maya civilization|Mayans]], [[ancient Egypt]]ians, [[Indian Astronomy|ancient Indians]], and [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese]] measured all the basics of their respective time and calendar systems by naked eye:
*the length of a year and a month to ±0.1 hour or to better than 1 minute (0.001%)
*the 24 hours of a day, and the [[equinox]]es
*the periods of the [[planet]]s were calculated by Mayan astronomers, to within 5 to 10 minutes accuracy in the case of Venus and Mars.

In a similar manner star [[occultation]]s by the moon can be observed. By using a digital [[clock]] an accuracy of 0.2 second is possible. This represents only 200 meters at the moon's distance of 385,000&amp;nbsp;km.

==Small objects and maps==
Observing a nearby small object without a [[magnifying glass]] or a [[microscope]], the size of the object depends on the viewing distance. Under normal lighting conditions (light source ~ 1000 lumens at height 600–700&amp;nbsp;mm, viewing angle ~ 35 degrees) the angular size recognized by naked eye will be round 1 arc minute = 1/60 degrees = 0.0003 radians.&lt;ref name="Yanoff2009"/&gt; At a viewing distance of 16" = ~ 400&amp;nbsp;mm, which is considered a normal reading distance in the USA, the smallest object resolution will be ~ 0.116&amp;nbsp;mm. For inspection purposes laboratories use a viewing distance of 200–250&amp;nbsp;mm,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} which gives the smallest size of the object recognizable to the naked eye of ~0.058- 0.072&amp;nbsp;mm(~55-75 micrometers).  The [[accuracy]] of a measurement ranges from 0.1 to 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm and depends on the experience of the observer. The latter figure is the usual positional accuracy of faint details in maps and technical plans.

==Environmental pollution==
[[File:Mars, 2099 (ESO).jpg|thumb|250px|The Milky Way is visible over the [[Very Large Telescope]], demonstrating clear atmosphere above [[Paranal Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mars, 2099?|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1226a/|accessdate=25 June 2012|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

A clean [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] is indicated by the fact that the Milky Way is visible. Comparing the zenith with the [[horizon]], shows how the "blue quality" is degraded depending on the amount of air pollution and dust. The twinkling of a star is an indication of the [[turbulence]] of the air. This is of importance in [[meteorology]] and for the "[[Astronomical seeing|seeing]]" of astronomy.

[[Light pollution]] is a significant problem for amateur astronomers but becomes less late at night when many lights are shut off. Air dust can be seen even far away from a city by its "light dome".

'''Non-equilibrium thermodynamics''' is a branch of [[thermodynamics]] that deals with physical systems that are not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] but can be described in terms of variables (non-equilibrium state variables) that represent an extrapolation  of the variables used to specify the system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is concerned with transport processes and with the rates of chemical reactions. It relies on what may be thought of as more or less nearness to thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a work in progress, not an established edifice. This article will try to sketch some approaches to it and some concepts important for it.

Almost all systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium, for they are changing or can be triggered to change over time, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems and to chemical reactions. Some systems and processes are, however, in a useful sense, near enough to thermodynamic equilibrium to allow description with useful accuracy by currently known non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Nevertheless, many natural systems and processes will always remain far beyond the scope of non-equilibrium thermodynamic methods.{{Citation needed|reason=This assumes that non-equilibrium thermodynamic methods will not change over time.  ''Always'' is too broad.|date=April 2018}} This is because of the very small size of atoms, as compared with macroscopic systems.

The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by [[equilibrium thermodynamics]]. One fundamental difference between equilibrium thermodynamics and non-equilibrium thermodynamics lies in the behaviour of inhomogeneous systems, which require for their study knowledge of rates of reaction which are not considered in equilibrium thermodynamics of homogeneous systems. This is discussed below. Another fundamental and very important difference is the difficulty or impossibility, in general, in defining [[entropy]] at an instant of time in macroscopic terms for systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium; it can be done, to useful approximation, only in carefully chosen special cases, namely those that are throughout in local thermodynamic equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Grandy 2008"&gt;Grandy, W.T., Jr (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lebon Jou Casas-Vázquez 2008"&gt;Lebon, G., Jou, D., Casas-Vázquez, J. (2008). ''Understanding Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics: Foundations, Applications, Frontiers'', Springer-Verlag, Berlin, e-{{ISBN|978-3-540-74252-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of non-equilibrium thermodynamics==

===Difference between equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics===
A profound difference separates equilibrium from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Equilibrium thermodynamics ignores the time-courses of physical processes. In contrast, non-equilibrium thermodynamics attempts to describe their time-courses in continuous detail.

Equilibrium thermodynamics restricts its considerations to processes that have initial and final states of thermodynamic equilibrium; the time-courses of processes are deliberately ignored. Consequently, equilibrium thermodynamics allows processes that pass through states far from thermodynamic equilibrium, that cannot be described even by the variables admitted for non-equilibrium thermodynamics,&lt;ref name="EY 5"&gt;[[Elliott H. Lieb|Lieb, E.H.]], [[Jakob Yngvason|Yngvason, J.]] (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; such as time rates of change of temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Gyarmati, I. (1967/1970), pp.&amp;nbsp;8–12.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in equilibrium thermodynamics, a process is allowed to include even a violent explosion that cannot be described by non-equilibrium thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="EY 5"/&gt; Equilibrium thermodynamics does, however, for theoretical development, use the idealized concept of the "quasi-static process".  A quasi-static process is a conceptual (timeless and physically impossible) smooth mathematical passage along a continuous path of states of thermodynamic equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1960/1985), §&amp;nbsp;4–2.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an exercise in differential geometry rather than a process that could occur in actuality.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics, on the other hand, attempting to describe continuous time-courses, need its [[State function|state variables]] to have a very close connection with those of equilibrium thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Glansdorff, P., Prigogine, I. (1971), Ch. {{math|II}},§&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; This profoundly restricts the scope of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and places heavy demands on its conceptual framework.

===Non-equilibrium state variables===
The suitable relationship that defines non-equilibrium thermodynamic state variables is as follows. On occasions when the system happens to be in states that are sufficiently close to thermodynamic equilibrium, non-equilibrium state variables are such that they can be measured locally with sufficient accuracy by the same techniques as are used to measure thermodynamic state variables, or by corresponding time and space derivatives, including fluxes of matter and energy. In general, non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems are spatially and temporally non-uniform, but their non-uniformity still has a sufficient degree of smoothness to support the existence of suitable time and space derivatives of non-equilibrium state variables. Because of the spatial non-uniformity, non-equilibrium state variables that correspond to extensive thermodynamic state variables have to be defined as spatial densities of the corresponding extensive equilibrium state variables. On occasions when the system is sufficiently close to thermodynamic equilibrium, intensive non-equilibrium state variables, for example temperature and pressure, correspond closely with equilibrium state variables. It is necessary that measuring probes be small enough, and rapidly enough responding, to capture relevant non-uniformity. Further, the non-equilibrium state variables are required to be mathematically functionally related to one another in ways that suitably resemble corresponding relations between equilibrium thermodynamic state variables.&lt;ref name="Gyarmati 1970"/&gt; In reality, these requirements are very demanding, and it may be difficult or practically, or even theoretically, impossible to satisfy them. This is part of why non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a work in progress.

==Overview==
Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a work in progress, not an established edifice. This article will try to sketch some approaches to it and some concepts important for it.

Some concepts of particular importance for non-equilibrium thermodynamics include time rate of dissipation of energy (Rayleigh 1873,&lt;ref name="Rayleigh 1873"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Strutt | first1 = J.

One problem of interest is the thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium [[steady state]]s, in which [[entropy]] production and some [[flux|flows]] are non-zero, but there is no [[Time-variant system|time variation]] of physical variables.

One initial approach to non-equilibrium thermodynamics is sometimes called 'classical irreversible thermodynamics'.&lt;ref name="Lebon Jou Casas-Vázquez 2008"/&gt; There are other approaches to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, for example [[extended irreversible thermodynamics]],&lt;ref name="Lebon Jou Casas-Vázquez 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JCVL 1993"/&gt; and generalized thermodynamics,&lt;ref&gt;Eu, B.C. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; but they are hardly touched on in the present article.

At laboratory temperatures, in laboratory quantities of matter, thermal radiation is weak and can be practically nearly ignored. But, for example, atmospheric physics is concerned with large amounts of matter, occupying cubic kilometers, that, taken as a whole, are not within the range of laboratory quantities; then thermal radiation cannot be ignored.

===Local equilibrium thermodynamics===
The terms 'classical irreversible thermodynamics'&lt;ref name="Lebon Jou Casas-Vázquez 2008"/&gt; and 'local equilibrium thermodynamics' are sometimes used to refer to a version of non-equilibrium thermodynamics that demands certain simplifying assumptions, as follows. The assumptions have the effect of making each very small volume element of the system effectively homogeneous, or well-mixed, or without an effective spatial structure, and without kinetic energy of bulk flow or of diffusive flux. Even within the thought-frame of classical irreversible thermodynamics, care&lt;ref name="Lavenda 1978"/&gt; is needed in choosing the independent variables&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I., Defay, R. (1950/1954). ''Chemical Thermodynamics'', Longmans, Green &amp; Co, London, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; for systems. In some writings, it is assumed that the intensive variables of equilibrium thermodynamics are sufficient as the independent variables for the task (such variables are considered to have no 'memory', and do not show hysteresis); in particular, local flow intensive variables are not admitted as independent variables; local flows are considered as dependent on quasi-static local intensive variables.

Also it is assumed that the local entropy density is the same function of the other local intensive variables as in equilibrium; this is called the local thermodynamic equilibrium assumption&lt;ref name="Gyarmati 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lavenda 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G&amp;P 1971"&gt;Glansdorff, P., Prigogine, I.

Radiation is ignored because it is transfer of energy between regions, which can be remote from one another. In the classical irreversible thermodynamic approach, there is allowed very small spatial variation, from very small volume element to adjacent very small volume element, but it is assumed that the global entropy of the system can be found by simple spatial integration of the local entropy density; this means that spatial structure cannot contribute as it properly should to the global entropy assessment for the system. This approach assumes spatial and temporal continuity and even differentiability of locally defined intensive variables such as temperature and internal energy density. All of these are very stringent demands. Consequently, this approach can deal with only a very limited range of phenomena. This approach is nevertheless valuable because it can deal well with some macroscopically observable phenomena.{{examples|date=February 2015}}

In other writings, local flow variables are considered; these might be considered as classical by analogy with the time-invariant long-term time-averages of flows produced by endlessly repeated cyclic processes; examples with flows are in the [[thermoelectric effect|thermoelectric phenomena]] known as the Seebeck and the Peltier effects, considered by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] in the nineteenth century and by [[Lars Onsager|Onsager]] in the twentieth.&lt;ref name="De Groot Mazur 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kondepudi, D. (2008). ''Introduction to Modern Thermodynamics'', Wiley, Chichester UK, {{ISBN|978-0-470-01598-8}}, pages 333-338.&lt;/ref&gt; These effects occur at metal junctions, which were originally effectively treated as two-dimensional surfaces, with no spatial volume, and no spatial variation.

====Local equilibrium thermodynamics with materials with "memory"====
A further extension of local equilibrium thermodynamics is to allow that materials may have "memory", so that their [[constitutive equation]]s depend not only on present values but also on past values of local equilibrium variables. Thus time comes into the picture more deeply than for time-dependent local equilibrium thermodynamics with memoryless materials, but fluxes are not independent variables of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coleman | first1 = B.D. | last2 = Noll | first2 = W. | year = 1963 | title = The thermodynamics of elastic materials with heat conduction and viscosity | url = | journal = Arch.

===Extended irreversible thermodynamics===
'''Extended irreversible thermodynamics''' is a branch of non-equilibrium thermodynamics that goes outside the restriction to the local equilibrium hypothesis. The space of state variables is enlarged by including the [[flux]]es of mass, momentum and energy and eventually higher order fluxes.
The formalism is well-suited for describing high-frequency processes and small-length scales materials.

==Basic concepts==
There are many examples of stationary non-equilibrium systems, some very simple, like a system confined between two thermostats at different temperatures or the ordinary  [[Couette flow]], a fluid  enclosed between two flat walls moving in opposite directions and defining non-equilibrium conditions at the walls. [[Laser]] action is also a non-equilibrium process, but it depends on departure from local thermodynamic equilibrium and is thus beyond the scope of classical irreversible thermodynamics; here a strong temperature difference is maintained between two molecular degrees of freedom (with molecular laser,  vibrational and rotational molecular motion), the requirement for two component 'temperatures' in the one small region of space, precluding local thermodynamic equilibrium, which demands that only one temperature be needed. Damping of acoustic perturbations or shock waves are non-stationary non-equilibrium processes.  Driven [[complex fluids]], turbulent systems and glasses are other examples of non-equilibrium systems.

The mechanics of macroscopic systems depends on a number of extensive quantities. It should be stressed that all systems are permanently interacting with their surroundings, thereby causing unavoidable fluctuations of [[extensive quantity|extensive quantiti]]es. Equilibrium conditions of thermodynamic systems are related to the maximum property of the entropy.  If the only extensive quantity that is allowed to fluctuate is the internal energy, all the other ones being kept strictly constant, the temperature of the system is measurable and meaningful. The system's properties are then most conveniently described using the thermodynamic potential [[Helmholtz free energy]] (''A'' = ''U'' - ''TS''), a  [[Legendre transformation]] of the energy. If, next to fluctuations of the energy, the macroscopic dimensions (volume) of the system are left fluctuating, we use the [[Gibbs free energy]] (''G'' = ''U'' + ''PV'' - ''TS''), where the system's properties are determined both by the temperature and by the pressure.

Non-equilibrium systems are much more complex and they may undergo fluctuations of more extensive quantities. The boundary conditions impose on them particular intensive variables, like temperature gradients or distorted collective motions (shear motions, vortices, etc.), often called thermodynamic forces. If free energies are very useful in equilibrium thermodynamics, it must be stressed that there is no general law defining stationary non-equilibrium properties of the energy as is the second law of thermodynamics for the [[entropy]] in equilibrium thermodynamics.  That is why in such cases a more generalized Legendre transformation should be considered. This is the extended Massieu potential.
By definition, the [[entropy]] (''S'') is a function of the collection of [[extensive quantity|extensive quantiti]]es &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt;. Each extensive quantity has a conjugate intensive variable &lt;math&gt;I_i&lt;/math&gt; (a restricted definition of intensive variable is used here by comparison to the definition given in this link)  so that:

:&lt;math&gt; I_i = \partial{S}/\partial{E_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

We then define the extended [[Massieu function]] as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\ k_b M = S - \sum_i( I_i E_i),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ k_b&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]], whence

:&lt;math&gt;\ k_b \, dM = \sum_i (E_i \, dI_i).&lt;/math&gt;

The independent variables are the intensities.

Intensities are global values, valid for the system as a whole. When boundaries impose to the system different local conditions, (e.g. temperature differences), there are intensive variables representing the average value and others representing gradients or higher moments. The latter are the thermodynamic forces driving fluxes of extensive properties through the system.

It may be shown that the Legendre transformation changes the maximum condition of the entropy (valid at equilibrium) in a minimum condition of the extended Massieu function for stationary states, no matter whether at equilibrium or not.

==Stationary states, fluctuations, and stability==
In thermodynamics one is often interested in a stationary state of a process, allowing that the stationary state include the occurrence of unpredictable and experimentally unreproducible fluctuations in the state of the system. The fluctuations are due to the system's internal sub-processes and to exchange of matter or energy with the system's surroundings that create the constraints that define the process.

If the stationary state of the process is stable, then the unreproducible fluctuations involve local transient decreases of entropy. The reproducible response of the system is then to increase the entropy back to its maximum by irreversible processes: the fluctuation cannot be reproduced with a significant level of probability. Fluctuations about stable stationary states are extremely small except near critical points (Kondepudi and Prigogine 1998, page 323).&lt;ref&gt;Kondepudi, D., Prigogine, I, (1998). ''Modern Thermodynamics. From Heat Engines to Dissipative Structures'', Wiley, Chichester, 1998, {{ISBN|0-471-97394-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The stable stationary state has a local maximum of entropy and is locally the most reproducible state of the system. There are theorems about the irreversible dissipation of fluctuations. Here 'local' means local with respect to the abstract space of thermodynamic coordinates of state of the system.

If the stationary state is unstable, then any fluctuation will almost surely trigger the virtually explosive departure of the system from the unstable stationary state. This can be accompanied by increased export of entropy.

==Local thermodynamic equilibrium==
The scope of present-day non-equilibrium thermodynamics does not cover all physical processes. A condition for the validity of many studies in non-equilibrium thermodynamics of matter is that they deal with what is known as ''local thermodynamic equilibrium''.

===Local thermodynamic equilibrium of ponderable matter===
''Local thermodynamic equilibrium of matter''&lt;ref name="Gyarmati 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G&amp;P 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balescu 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mihalas Mihalas 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schloegl 1989"/&gt; (see also Keizer (1987)&lt;ref name="Keizer 1987"/&gt; means that conceptually, for study and analysis, the system can be spatially and temporally divided into 'cells' or 'micro-phases' of small (infinitesimal) size, in which classical thermodynamical equilibrium conditions for matter are fulfilled to good approximation. These conditions are unfulfilled, for example, in very rarefied gases, in which molecular collisions are infrequent; and in the boundary layers of a star, where radiation is passing energy to space; and for interacting fermions at very low temperature, where dissipative processes become ineffective. When these 'cells' are defined, one admits that matter and energy may pass freely between contiguous 'cells', slowly enough to leave the 'cells' in their respective individual local thermodynamic equilibria with respect to intensive variables.

One can think here of two 'relaxation times' separated by order of magnitude.&lt;ref name="Zubarev 1971/1974"&gt;[[Dmitry Zubarev|Zubarev D. N.]],(1974). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SQy3AAAAIAAJ&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI Nonequilibrium Statistical Thermodynamics]'', translated from the Russian by P.J. Shepherd, New York, Consultants Bureau. {{ISBN|0-306-10895-X}}; {{ISBN|978-0-306-10895-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The longer relaxation time is of the order of magnitude of times taken for the macroscopic dynamical structure of the system to change. The shorter is of the order of magnitude of times taken for a single 'cell' to reach local thermodynamic equilibrium. If these two relaxation times are not well separated, then the classical non-equilibrium thermodynamical concept of local thermodynamic equilibrium loses its meaning&lt;ref name="Zubarev 1971/1974"/&gt; and other approaches have to be proposed,  see for instance [[Extended irreversible thermodynamics]]. For example, in the atmosphere, the speed of sound is much greater than the wind speed; this favours the idea of local thermodynamic equilibrium of matter for atmospheric heat transfer studies at altitudes below about 60&amp;nbsp;km where sound propagates, but not above 100&amp;nbsp;km, where, because of the paucity of intermolecular collisions, sound does not propagate.

===Milne's 1928 definition of local thermodynamic equilibrium in terms of radiative equilibrium===
Milne (1928),&lt;ref name="Milne 1928"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Milne |first1= E.A. |year=1928 | title= The effect of collisions on monochromatic radiative equilibrium |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume= 88|pages=493–502|bibcode=1928MNRAS..88..493M | doi = 10.1093/mnras/88.6.493 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking about stars, gave a definition of 'local thermodynamic equilibrium' in terms of the [[thermal radiation]] of the [[matter]] in each small local 'cell'. He defined 'local thermodynamic equilibrium' in a 'cell' by requiring that it macroscopically absorb and spontaneously emit radiation as if it were in radiative equilibrium in a cavity at the [[temperature]] of the matter of the 'cell'. Then it strictly obeys Kirchhoff's law of equality of radiative emissivity and absorptivity, with a black body source function. The key to local thermodynamic equilibrium here is that the rate of collisions of ponderable matter particles such as molecules should far exceed the rates of creation and annihilation of photons.

==Entropy in evolving systems==

Grandy Jr that entropy, though it may be defined for a non-equilibrium system, is when strictly considered, only a macroscopic quantity that refers to the whole system, and is not a dynamical variable and in general does not act as a local potential that describes local physical forces. Under special circumstances, however, one can metaphorically think as if the thermal variables behaved like local physical forces. The approximation that constitutes classical irreversible thermodynamics is built on this metaphoric thinking.

This point of view shares many points in common with the concept and the use of entropy in continuum thermomechanics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Rational Thermodynamics | year = 1984 | last1 = Truesdell | first1 = Clifford | publisher = Springer | edition = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Continuum Thermomechanics | year = 2002 | last1 = Maugin | first1 = Gérard A. | publisher = Kluwer }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Continua | year = 2010 | last1 = Gurtin | first1 = Morton E. | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Thermodynamics of Materials with Memory: Theory and Applications | year = 2012| last1 = Amendola | first1 = Giovambattista | publisher = Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt; which evolved completely independently of statistical mechanics and maximum-entropy principles.

===Entropy in non-equilibrium===

To describe deviation of the thermodynamic system from equilibrium, in addition to constitutive variables  &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, ..., x_n&lt;/math&gt;  that are used to fix  the equilibrium state, as was described above, a set of variables &lt;math&gt;\xi_1, \xi_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;  that are called ''internal variables'' have been introduced. The equilibrium state is considered to be stable and the main property of the internal variables, as measures of [[non-equilibrium]] of the system, is their trending to disappear; the local law of disappearing can be written as relaxation equation for each internal variable
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\xi_i}{dt} = - \frac{1}{\tau_i} \, \left(\xi_i - \xi_i^{(0)} \right),\quad i =1,\,2,\ldots , 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
where &lt;math&gt; \tau_i= \tau_i(T, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;  is a relaxation time of a corresponding variables. It is convenient to consider the initial value &lt;math&gt; \xi_i^0&lt;/math&gt;  are equal to zero. The above equation is valid for small deviations from equilibrium; The dynamics of internal variables in general case is considered by Pokrovskii&lt;ref&gt; Pokrovskii V.N. (2013) A derivation of the main relations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Hindawi Publishing Corporation: ISRN Thermodynamics, vol. 2013, article ID 906136, 9 p.  https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/906136. &lt;/ref&gt;.    

Entropy of the system in  non-equilibrium is a function of the total set of variables 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
S=S(T, x_1, x_2, , x_n; \xi_1, \xi_2,  \ldots) 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
The essential contribution to the thermodynamics of the  [[non-equilibrium systems]] was brought by [[Prigogine]],  when he and his collaborators  investigated the systems of  chemically reacting substances. The stationary  states of such systems exists due to exchange both particles and energy with the environment. In section 8 of the third chapter of his book &lt;ref&gt;[[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine, I.]] (1955/1961/1967). ''Introduction to Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes''. 3rd edition, Wiley Interscience, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;, Prigogine has specified three contributions to the variation of entropy of the considered system at the given volume and constant temperature &lt;math&gt; T&lt;/math&gt; . The increment of [[entropy]] &lt;math&gt; S&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated according to the formula 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
T\,dS = \Delta Q - \sum_{j} \, \Xi_{j} \,\Delta \xi_j  + \sum_{\alpha =1}^k\, \mu_\alpha \, \Delta N_\alpha.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
The first term on the right hand side of the equation presents a stream of thermal energy into the  system;  the last term --  a stream of energy into the system coming with the stream of particles of substances  &lt;math&gt; \Delta N_\alpha &lt;/math&gt;  that can be positive or negative, &lt;math&gt; \mu_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;  is [[chemical potential]] of substance &lt;math&gt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.   The  middle term in (1) depicts [[ energy dissipation]] ([[entropy production]])  due to the  relaxation of internal variables &lt;math&gt; \xi_j&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of chemically  reacting substances, which  was investigated  by Prigogine, the internal variables appear to be measures of incompleteness of chemical reactions, that is  measures of how much  the considered system with chemical reactions is  out of equilibrium. The theory can be  generalised &lt;ref&gt; Pokrovskii V.N. (2005) Extended thermodynamics in a discrete-system approach,  Eur. J. Phys.  vol. 26,  769-781.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Pokrovskii V.N.

==Flows and forces==
The fundamental relation of classical equilibrium thermodynamics &lt;ref name="W. Greiner et. al. 1997"&gt;W. Greiner, L. Neise, and H. Stöcker (1997), ''Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics (Classical Theoretical Physics)'' ,Springer-Verlag, New York, '''P85, 91, 101,108,116''', {{ISBN|0-387-94299-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;dS=\frac{1}{T}dU+\frac{p}{T}dV-\sum_{i=1}^s\frac{\mu_i}{T}dN_i&lt;/math&gt;

expresses the change in [[entropy]] &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; of a system as a function of the intensive quantities [[temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, [[pressure]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; [[chemical potential]] &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; and of the differentials of the extensive quantities [[energy]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; [[particle number]] &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Following Onsager (1931,I),&lt;ref name="Onsager 1931 I"/&gt; let us extend our considerations to thermodynamically non-equilibrium systems. As a basis, we need locally defined versions of the extensive macroscopic quantities &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; and of the intensive macroscopic quantities &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt;.

For classical non-equilibrium studies, we will consider some new locally defined intensive macroscopic variables. We can, under suitable conditions, derive these new variables by locally defining the gradients and flux densities of the basic locally defined macroscopic quantities.

Such locally defined gradients of intensive macroscopic variables are called 'thermodynamic forces'. They 'drive' flux densities, perhaps misleadingly often called 'fluxes', which are dual to the forces. These quantities are defined in the article on [[Onsager reciprocal relations]].
 
Establishing the relation between such forces and flux densities is a problem in statistical mechanics. Flux densities (&lt;math&gt;J_i&lt;/math&gt;) may be coupled. The article on [[Onsager reciprocal relations]] considers the stable near-steady thermodynamically non-equilibrium regime, which has dynamics linear in the forces and flux densities.

In stationary conditions, such forces and associated flux densities are by definition time invariant, as also are the system's locally defined entropy and rate of entropy production. Notably, according to [[Ilya Prigogine]] and others, when an open system is in conditions that allow it to reach a stable stationary thermodynamically non-equilibrium state, it organizes itself so as to minimize total entropy production defined locally. This is considered further below.

One wants to take the analysis to the further stage of describing the behaviour of surface and volume integrals of non-stationary local quantities; these integrals are macroscopic fluxes and production rates. In general the dynamics of these integrals are not adequately described by linear equations, though in special cases they can be so described.

==The Onsager relations==
{{Main article|Onsager reciprocal relations}}
Following Section III of Rayleigh (1873),&lt;ref name="Rayleigh 1873"/&gt; Onsager (1931, I)&lt;ref name="Onsager 1931 I"/&gt; showed that in the regime where both the flows (&lt;math&gt;J_i&lt;/math&gt;) are small and the thermodynamic forces (&lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt;) vary slowly, the rate of creation of entropy &lt;math&gt;(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; is [[linear relation|linearly related]] to the flows:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma =  \sum_i J_i\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

and the flows are related to the gradient of the forces, parametrized by a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of coefficients conventionally denoted &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;J_i =  \sum_{j} L_{ij} \frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x_j} &lt;/math&gt;

from which it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma =  \sum_{i,j} L_{ij} \frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x_j} &lt;/math&gt;

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires that the matrix &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]]. [[Statistical mechanics]] considerations involving microscopic reversibility of dynamics imply that the matrix &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]]. This fact is called the ''Onsager reciprocal relations''.

The generalization of the above equations for the rate of creation of entropy was given by Pokrovskii  &lt;ref&gt; Pokrovskii V.N. (2013) A derivation of the main relations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Hindawi Publishing Corporation: ISRN Thermodynamics, vol. 2013, article ID 906136, 9 p.  https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/906136. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculated extremal principles for non-equilibrium processes==
{{main article|Extremal principles in non-equilibrium thermodynamics}}

Until recently, prospects for useful extremal principles in this area have seemed clouded. C. Nicolis (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/qj.49712555718 | last1 = Nicolis | first1 = C. | year = 1999 | title = Entropy production and dynamical complexity in a low-order atmospheric model | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society | volume = 125 | issue = 557| pages = 1859–1878 |bibcode = 1999QJRMS.125.1859N }}&lt;/ref&gt; concludes that one model of atmospheric dynamics has an attractor which is not a regime of maximum or minimum dissipation; she says this seems to rule out the existence of a global organizing principle, and comments that this is to some extent disappointing; she also points to the difficulty of finding a thermodynamically consistent form of entropy production. Another top expert offers an extensive discussion of the possibilities for principles of extrema of entropy production and of dissipation of energy: Chapter 12 of Grandy (2008)&lt;ref name="Grandy 2008"/&gt; is very cautious, and finds difficulty in defining the 'rate of internal entropy production' in many cases, and finds that sometimes for the prediction of the course of a process, an extremum of the quantity called the rate of dissipation of energy may be more useful than that of the rate of entropy production; this quantity appeared in Onsager's 1931&lt;ref name="Onsager 1931 I"/&gt; origination of this subject. Other writers have also felt that prospects for general global extremal principles are clouded. Such writers include Glansdorff and Prigogine (1971), Lebon, Jou and Casas-Vásquez (2008), and Šilhavý (1997).

A recent proposal may perhaps by-pass those clouded prospects.&lt;ref name="Attard 2012"&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Attard|first=P.|title=Optimising Principle for Non-Equilibrium Phase Transitions and Pattern Formation with Results for Heat Convection|journal=|year=2012|arxiv=1208.5105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attard, P.

== Production Process ==
The Seattle based chocolate maker Theo Chocolate was one of the first companies that were "fair-trade certified" and produced Organic Chocolate. In 2006 Theo Chocolate began their production of organic chocolate, there were no solid guidelines for the manufacturing and they had to get the process and ingredients in the correct measurements. The main ingredient in chocolate, cocoa is going to be found close to the equator and the majority of it is grown in Western Africa. The organic cocoa, the main ingredient in organic chocolate, is sent to the chocolate factor where they arrive in burlap sacks. The cocoa beans are then thoroughly cleaned and foreign objects are removed until just the beans remain. The manufacturer makes sure to use all organic ingredients to ensure that the final product is truly organic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://emagazine.com/sweet-dreams/|title=Sweet Dreams|date=2007-10-26|work=Emagazine.com|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Performativity''' is [[language]] which effects change in the world and functions as a form of social action.&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavanaugh|first1=Jillian R.|title=Performativity|journal=Anthropology|date=10 March 2015|doi=10.1093/OBO/9780199766567-0114|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0114.xml|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has multiple applications in diverse fields, such as [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], [[jurisprudence|law]], [[gender studies]], [[performance studies]], and [[economics]].

Performativity was first defined by [[philosopher of language]] [[J. L. Austin|John L. Austin]] as the capacity of speech and communication to act or to consummate an action. Common examples of performative language are making promises, betting, performing a wedding ceremony, an umpire calling a strike, or a judge pronouncing a verdict. Austin differentiated this from constative language, which he defined as descriptive language that can be "evaluated as true or false".&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh/&gt;

Influenced by Austin, philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] argued that [[social construction of gender|gender is socially constructed]] through commonplace [[speech act]]s and [[nonverbal communication]] that are performative, in that they serve to define and maintain [[social identity|identities]].&lt;ref name="Butler1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of performativity reverses the idea that a person's identity is the source of their secondary actions (speech, gestures). Instead, it views actions, behaviors and gestures as both the result of an individual's identity as well as a source that contributes to the formation of one's identity which is continuously being redefined through speech acts and symbolic communication.&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh/&gt; This view was also influenced by philosophers such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Studies and Discourse Analysis – Barker &amp; Galasinski&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===J. L. Austin===

The term derives from the founding work in [[speech act]] theory by ordinary language philosopher [[J. L. Austin]], who did not use the word "performativity", but did, beginning in the 1950s, give the name [[performative utterances]] to situations where saying something was doing something, rather than simply reporting on or describing reality. The paradigmatic case here is speaking the words "I do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=J L|title=How To Do Things With Words|year=1962|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking with [[analytic philosophy]], Austin argued in ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]'' that a "performative utterance" cannot be said to be either true or false, as a constative utterance might be. It can only be judged either "happy" or "infelicitous", depending upon whether the conditions required for its success have been met. In this sense, performativity is a function of the [[pragmatics]] of language. Having shown that ''all'' utterances perform actions, even apparently constative ones, Austin famously discarded the distinction between "performative" and "constative" utterances halfway through the lecture series that became the book and replaced it with a three-level framework:

* ''locution'' (the actual words spoken, that which the linguists and linguistic philosophers of the day were mostly interested in analyzing) 
* ''illocutionary force'' (what the speaker is attempting to do ''in'' uttering the locution) 
* ''perlocutionary effect'' (the actual effect the speaker actually has on the interlocutor ''by'' uttering the locution)

For example, if a speech act is an attempt to distract someone, the illocutionary force is the attempt to distract and the perlocutionary effect is the actual distraction caused by the speech act in the interlocutor.

Austin's account of performativity has been subject to extensive discussion in philosophy, literature, and beyond. [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Judith Butler]], and [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] are among the scholars who have elaborated upon and contested aspects of Austin's account from the vantage point of [[deconstruction]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[feminism]], and [[queer theory]]. Particularly in the work of feminists and queer theorists, performativity has played an important role in discussions of [[social change]] (Oliver 2003).

The concept of performativity has also been used in [[science and technology studies]] and in [[economic sociology]]. [[Andrew Pickering]] has proposed to shift from a "representational idiom" to a "performative idiom" in the study of science. [[Michel Callon]] has proposed to study the performative aspects of [[economics]], i.e. the extent to which economic science plays an important role not only in describing markets and economies, but also in framing them. Karen Barad has argued that science and technology studies deemphasize the performativity of language in order to explore the performativity of matter (Barad 2003).

Other uses of the notion of performativity in the social sciences include the daily behavior (or performance) of individuals based on social norms or habits. Philosopher and feminist theorist [[Judith Butler]] has used the concept of performativity in her analysis of [[gender]] development, as well as in her analysis of political speech. [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] describes [[Queer theory|queer]] performativity as an ongoing project for transforming the way we may define—and break—boundaries to identity. Through her suggestion that shame is a potentially performative and transformational emotion, Sedgwick has also linked queer performativity to [[affect theory]]. Also innovative in Sedgwick's discussion of the performative is what she calls ''periperformativity'' (2003: 67–91), which is effectively the group contribution to the success or failure of a speech act.

===John Searle's reformulation===
In ''[[A Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts]]'', [[John Searle]] takes up and reformulates the ideas of his colleague [[J. L. Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Searle largely supports and agrees with Austin’s theory of speech acts, he has a number of critiques, which he outlines: “In sum, there are (at least) six related difficulties with Austin’s taxonomy; in ascending order of importance: there is a persistent confusion between verbs and acts, not all the verbs are illocutionary verbs, there is too much overlap of the categories, too much heterogeneity within the categories, many of the verbs listed in the categories don't satisfy the definition given for the category and, most important, there is no consistent principle of classification.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last key departure from Austin lies in Searle’s claim that four of his universal ‘acts’ do not need ‘extra-linguistic’ contexts to succeed.&lt;ref name="John1979"&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to Austin who thinks all illocutionary acts need extra-linguistic institutions, Searle disregards the necessity of context and replaces it with the “rules of language.”&lt;ref name="John1979" /&gt;

=== Jacques Derrida ===
Philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] drew on Austin's theory of performative speech act while deconstructing its logocentric and phonocentric premises and reinscribing it within the operations of generalized writing. In contrast to structuralism's focus on linguistic form, Austin had introduced the ''force'' of speech acts, which Derrida aligns with [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] insights on language. 

In "Signature, Event, Context," Derrida focused on Austin's privileging of speech and the accompanying presumptions of the presence of a speaker ("signature") and the bounding of a performative's force by an act or a context. In a passage that would become a touchstone of poststructuralist thought, Derrida stresses the citationality or iterability of any and all signs.&lt;blockquote&gt;Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the current sense of this opposition), in a small or large unit, can be ''cited'', put between quotation marks; in doing so it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable. This does not imply that the mark is valid outside of a context, but on the contrary that there are only contexts without any center or absolute anchorage [''ancrage'']. This citationality, this duplication or duplicity, this iterability of the mark is neither an accident nor an anomaly, it is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could not even have a function called "normal." What would a mark be that could not be cited? Or one whose origins would not get lost along the way?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Limited, Inc.|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0810107885|location=Evanston|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Derrida's stress on the citational dimension of performativity would be taken up by Judith Butler and other theorists. While he addressed the performativity of individual subject formation, Derrida also raised such questions as whether we can mark when the event of the Russian revolution went awry, thus scaling up the field of performativity to historical dimensions. 

=== Judith Butler ===
{{Main|Gender performativity}}

Philosopher and [[feminist]] theorist [[Judith Butler]] offered a new, more [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] (specifically, [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]]) reading of the notion of performativity, which has its roots in [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy of language]]. She describes performativity as “that reiterative power of discourse to produce the phenomena that it regulates and constrains.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bodies that Matter:  On the Discursive Limits of "Sex"|last = Butler|first = Judith|publisher = Routledge|year = 1993|isbn = 9780415903660|location = New York|pages = xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has largely used this concept in her analysis of [[gender]] development.&lt;ref&gt;This idea was first introduced in 1988 in an issue of ''[[Theatre Journal]]'' (Brickell, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept places emphasis on the manners by which identity is passed or brought to life through discourse.  Performative acts are types of authoritative speech. This can only happen and be enforced through the law or norms of the society. These statements, just by speaking them, carry out a certain action and exhibit a certain level of power. Examples of these types of statements are declarations of ownership, baptisms, inaugurations, and legal sentences. Something that is key to performativity is repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halberstam|first=Jack|title=An audio overview of queer theory in English and Turkish by Jack Halberstam|url=https://archive.org/details/HalberstamQueerTheory-AnkaraTurkey|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statements are not singular in nature or use and must be used consistently in order to exert power (Hall 2000).

==== Performance theory and gender perspectives ====

Butler sees gender as an act that has been rehearsed, much like a script, and that people, as actors who make a script a reality through repetition, come to perform in the mode of belief. “For Butler, the distinction between the personal and the political or between private and public is itself a fiction designed to support an oppressive status quo: our most personal acts are, in fact, continually being scripted by hegemonic social conventions and ideologies” (Felluga, 2006).  Butler sees gender not as an expression of what one is, rather as something that one does.  Furthermore, she sees it not as a social imposition on a gender neutral body, but rather as a mode of "self-making" through which subjects become socially intelligible.  According to Butler’s theory, homosexuality and heterosexuality are not fixed categories.  A person is merely in a condition of “doing straightness” or “doing queerness” (Lloyd, 1999).

==== Theoretical criticisms ====

There are several criticisms that have been raised against Butler's concept of performativity.  The first is that the theory is individual in nature and does not take other factors into consideration.  These factors include the space within which the performance occurs, the others involved and how they might see or interpret what they witness.  Also, the unplanned effects of the performance act are overlooked and the contingencies are not taken into consideration. (Lloyd, 1999)

Another criticism is that Butler is not clear about the concept of subject.  It has been said that in her writings, sometimes the subject only exists tentatively, sometimes they possess a “real” existence and other times are socially active.  Also, some observe that the theory might be better suited to literary analysis as opposed to social theory. (Brickell, 2005)

Others criticize Butler for taking [[Ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] and [[Symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] sociological analyses of gender and merely reinventing them in the concept of performativity (Dunn 1997; Green 2007).  For example, Green (2007) argues that the work of [[Sue Kessler|Kessler]] and [[Wendy McKenna|McKenna]] (1978) and West and Zimmerman (1987) builds directly from [[Harold Garfinkel|Garfinkel]] (1967) and [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] (1959) to deconstruct gender into moments of attribution and iteration in a continual social process of "doing" [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]] in the [[performative interval]].  These latter works are premised on the notion that gender does not precede but, rather, follows from practice, instantiated in micro-interaction. Butler downgrades gender's constructed nature to fight for oppressed identities.

=== Jean-François Lyotard ===
In ''[[The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge]]'' (1979, English translation 1986), philosopher and cultural theorist [[Jean-François Lyotard]] defined performativity as the defining mode of [[legitimation]] of postmodern knowledge and social bonds, that is, power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge.|last=Lyotard|first=Jean-Francois|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0816611737|location=Minneapolis|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the legitimation of modern knowledge through such grand narratives as Progress, Revolution, and Liberation, performativity operates by system optimization or the calculation of input and outputs. In a footnote, Lyotard aligns performativity with Austin's concept of performative speech act. Postmodern knowledge must not only report: it must do something and do it efficiently by maximizing input/output ratios.

Lyotard uses [[Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics|Wittgenstein's]] notion of language games to theorize how performativity governs the articulation, funding, and conduct of contemporary research and education, arguing that at bottom it involves the threat of terror: "be operational (that is commensurable) or disappear" (xxiv). While Lyotard is highly critical of performativity, he notes that it calls on researchers to explain not only the worth of their work but also the worth of that worth. 

Lyotard associated performativity with the rise of digital computers in the post-World War II period. In ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945,'' historian [[Tony Judt]] cites Lyotard to argue that the Left has largely abandoned revolutionary politics for human rights advocacy. The widespread adoption of performance reviews, organizational assessments, and learning outcomes by different social institutions worldwide has led social researchers to theorize "audit culture" and "global performativity." 

Against performativity and [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]]' call for consensus, Lyotard argued for legitimation by ''paralogy'', or the destabilizing, often paradoxical, introduction of difference into language games.

==Other applications==

===Video art===

Theories of performativity have extended across multiple disciplines and discussions. Notably, interdisciplinary theorist [[José Esteban Muñoz]] has related video to theories of performativity. Specifically, Muñoz looks at the 1996 documentary by Susana Aiken and Carlos Aparicio, "The Transformation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics|author = Muñoz|authorlink = José Esteban Muñoz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historically and theoretically related to performance art, [[video art]] is not an immediate performance; it is mediated, iterative and citational. In this way, video art raises questions of performativity. Additionally, video art frequently puts bodies and display, complicating borders, surfaces, embodiment, and boundaries and so indexing performativity.

=== Finance and economics ===
In economics, the “performativity thesis” is the claim that the assumptions and models used by professionals and popularizers affect the phenomena they purport to describe; bringing the world more into line with theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/performativity.pdf|title = The Performativity of Networks|last = Healy|first = Kieran|date = 2015|journal = European Journal of Sociology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doing"&gt;{{cite book|title=Doing Economics|date=2010|publisher=The Open University|location=Milton Keynes|isbn=978 1 8487 34692|page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is debated in ''Do Economists Make Markets'' edited by [[Donald Angus MacKenzie]], Fabian Muniesa and Lucia Siu, and in ''Enacting Dismal Science'' edited by Ivan Boldyrev and Ekaterina Svetlova. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8442.html | title=Do Economists Make Markets?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9781137492104# | title=Enacting Dismal Science - New Perspectives on the Performativity of Economics &amp;#124; Ivan Boldyrev &amp;#124; Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journalism ===

The German news anchorman [[Hanns Joachim Friedrichs]] once argued that a good journalist should never act in collusion with anything, not even with a good thing. In the evening of November 9, 1989, the evening of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], however, Friedrichs reportedly broke his own rule when he announced: "The gates of the wall are wide open." („Die Tore in der Mauer stehen weit offen.“) In reality, the gates were still closed. According to a historian, it was this announcement that encouraged thousands of East Berliners to march towards the wall, finally forcing the border guards to open the gates. In the sense of performativity, Friedrichs's words became a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/mauerfall/der-schoenste-fehler-in-40-jahren-tagesthemen-54357108.bild.html | title=Zum Jubiläum - der schönste Fehler in 40 Jahren "Tagesthemen"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/30/AR2009103001846.html | title=Mary Elise Sarotte -- How an accident caused the Berlin Wall to come down| date=November 2009| last1=Sarotte| first1=Mary Elise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="838">A '''ply''' is a [[wikt:layer|layer]] of material which has been combined with other layers in order to provide strength. The number of layers is indicated by prefixing a number, for example 4-ply, indicating material composed of 4 layers.

==Etymology==
The word "ply" derives from the French verb ''plier'',&lt;ref&gt;Collins Dictionary of the English Language, 2nd Edition, London, 1986, p.1181&lt;/ref&gt; "to fold", from the Latin verb ''plico'', from the ancient Greek verb ''πλέκω''.&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, &amp; Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928, p.421&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*Yarn, where [[plying]] is a spinning technique to combine several fibres.
*Vehicle [[Tire]]s
*[[Plywood]]
*[[Toilet paper]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17720">'''Product lifetime''' or '''product lifespan''' is the time interval from when a product is sold to when it is discarded.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is slightly different from [[service life]] because the latter consider only the effective time the product is used.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Product lifetime represent an important area of enquiry with regards to [[product design]], the [[circular economy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2016/579000/IPOL_STU(2016)579000_EN.pdf|title=A longer lifetime for products: benefits for consumers and companies|last=Montalvo, C.,  Peck, D. and Rietveld, E.|publisher=European Parliament's Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO)|year=2016|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Longer Lasting Products: alternatives to the throwaway society|last=Cooper|first=T|publisher=Gower|year=2010|isbn=|editor-last=Cooper, T.|location=Farnham|pages=3–36|chapter=The significance of product longevity|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because products, with the materials involved in their design, production, distribution, use and disposal (across their [[Life Cycle Thinking|life cycle]]), embody carbon due to the energy involved in these processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ciemap.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CIEMAP-Report.pdf|title=A whole system analysis of how industrial energy and material demand reduction can contribute to a low carbon future for the UK.|last=Norman, J.B., Serrenho, A.C., Cooper, S.J.G., Owen, A., Sakai, M., Scott, K., Brockway, P.E., Cooper, S., Giesekam, J., Salvia, G., Cullen, J.M., Barrett, J.R., Cooper, T., Hammond, G.P. and Allwood, J.M.|publisher=CIE-MAP|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if product lifetimes can be extended, the [[Embodied energy|use of energy]], [[Embodied carbon emissions|embodied in carbon]], can be reduced and progress can be made towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions: Bocken et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bocken|first=Nancy M.

In recent years, there has been a growth in academic and policy discussions around product lifetimes. For example, discussion of product lifetimes are an integral part of the European Commission's action plan for the circular economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:8a8ef5e8-99a0-11e5-b3b7-01aa75ed71a1.0012.02/DOC_1&amp;format=PDF|title=Closing the loop - An EU action plan for the Circular Economy|last=European Commission|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' In academia, the PLATE (Product Lifetimes and the Environment) Consortium hosts regular conferences and seminars around the topic of product lifetimes and the environment (see: http://www.plateconference.org/).

This article examines how product lifetimes are defined in the academic literature and discusses how product lifetimes can be measured. A distinction is made between the definition and measurement of ''actual'' and ''expected'' product lifetimes.

== Defining product lifetimes ==

Definitions of product lifetimes vary depending on what aspects those conducting research are interested in. Generally, actual product lifetimes refer to the actual time that a product exists in a particular state.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In contrast, expected product lifetimes refer to users' expectations for the lifetime of a product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, actual and expected product lifetimes are influenced by durability and longevity; these concepts are briefly outlined below.

Durability is described by Cooper&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond recycling: the longer life option|last=Cooper, T.|publisher=New Economics Foundation|year=1994|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "the ability of a product to perform its required function over a lengthy period under normal use conditions of use without excessive expenditure on maintenance or repair" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). In contrast, longevity encompasses more than just the material properties of the product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cooper&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; notes that user behaviour, and broader social and cultural trends play important roles in the product's longevity. The paragraphs below outline the definitions of actual and expected product lifetimes.

=== Actual product lifetimes ===
Exhaustive work has been undertaken by Murakami et al.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murakami|first=Shinsuke|last2=Oguchi|first2=Masahiro|last3=Tasaki|first3=Tomohiro|last4=Daigo|first4=Ichiro|last5=Hashimoto|first5=Seiji|date=2010-08-01|title=Lifespan of Commodities, Part I|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2010.00250.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=598–612|doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2010.00250.x|issn=1530-9290}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oguchi|first=Masahiro|last2=Murakami|first2=Shinsuke|last3=Tasaki|first3=Tomohiro|last4=Daigo|first4=Ichiro|last5=Hashimoto|first5=Seiji|date=2010-08-01|title=Lifespan of Commodities, Part II|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2010.00251.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=613–626|doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2010.00251.x|issn=1530-9290}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to outline several definitions and discuss methods for identifying actual product lifetimes. Murkami et al.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; identify the following overarching concepts in product lifetime definitions which are discussed below: Age, Residential time, Service life, Possession span and Duration of use.

==== Age ====
A product's age is the time from when the product was created to either the present or "the time of interest" (:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 600) for the researchers.

==== Residential time ====
Residential time is considered to be time in which a product, its constituent materials and parts, exists in society.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Residential time includes the time in which a product may be broken and/ or discarded.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Service life ====
{{Main|Service life}}

According to Murkami et al.,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; the service life of a product refers to the duration of time for which products continue to work and can be used.

==== Possession span ====
The possession span is the period of time that a user has possession of the product.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Duration of use ====
The duration of use indicates how long a user uses the product for.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Murkami et al.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; distinguish duration of use from [[Service life]] by noting that duration of use is measured for a specific user, whereas [[Service life]] describes the total in-service use of the product for all its users (accounting for transfers of ownership e.g. reuse). Additionally, possession span is distinguished from duration of use, as possession span includes "dead storage" (:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 601) time, where a product is owned by a user but not in use (i.e. in storage).

=== Expected product lifetimes ===
A conference paper by Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/28621/|title=Electronics Goes Green 2016+ Conference|last=Oguchi, M., Tasaki, T., Daigo, I., Cooper, T., Cole, C. and Gnanapragasam, A.|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=|chapter=Consumers' expectations for product lifetimes of consumer durables.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sought to identify and test differences in definitions of product lifetime expectations. Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; illustrated that previous research into expected product lifetimes has been inconsistent in its use of the term expected product lifetimes. For example, Cooper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|title=Inadequate Life? Evidence of Consumer Attitudes to Product Obsolescence|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10603-004-2284-6|journal=Journal of Consumer Policy|language=en|volume=27|issue=4|pages=421–449|doi=10.1007/s10603-004-2284-6|issn=0168-7034}}&lt;/ref&gt; enquires about "reasonable" expected lifetimes, while Brook Lyndhurst&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.brooklyndhurst.co.uk/public-understanding-of-product-lifetimes-and-durability-_156.html|title=Public understanding of product lifetimes and durability (1)|last=Brook Lyndhurst|publisher=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|year=2011|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Jayne|last2=Griffith|first2=Sarah|last3=Giorgi|first3=Sara|last4=King|first4=Geoff|date=2013-10-01|title=Consumer understanding of product lifetimes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092134491300102X|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|series=SI: Resourceful Behaviours|volume=79|pages=21–29|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  discusses "normal" expected lifetimes. Wieser et al.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www4.ntu.ac.uk/plate_conference/proceedings/index.html|title=Product Lifetimes and The Environment|last=Wieser, H., Tröger, N. and Hübner, R.|publisher=Nottingham Trent University|year=|isbn=|location=Nottingham|pages=388–393|chapter=The consumers’ desired and expected product lifetimes|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified the tension between everyday expectations and desires, distinguishing between these expectations in his study of 21 products. In addition, earlier work by Tasaki et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=智宏|first=田崎|last2=淳|first2=寺園|last3=祐一|first3=森口|date=2004-01-01|title=長期使用とリュース促進のための家電製品・パソコンの廃棄行動実態とその行動要因の調査|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jswme1990/15/4/15_4_310/_article/-char/ja/|journal=廃棄物学会論文誌|volume=15|issue=4|pages=310–319|doi=10.3985/jswme.15.310}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recent work by WRAP&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/clothing-longevity-measuring-active-use|title=Clothing longevity and measuring active use|last=Langley, E., Durkacz, S. and Tanase, S.|publisher=WRAP|year=2013|isbn=|location=Banbury|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have asked users to report both how long they have owned an item for, and how long they expect to use the item for in future: WRAP&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; term this "active use". Building on these previous studies (''described above''), Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; identified and tested three distinct definitions of expected product lifetimes, these are outlined below.

==== Intended lifetime ====
Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; define the intended lifetime as the length of time for which a user intends to use the product in question.

==== Ideal lifetime ====
The ideal length of time for which a user expects their product to last. Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; describe this as "the highest preference of consumers".

==== Predicted lifetime ====
The realist prediction by the user of how long a product will last. The user is thought to make this prediction based on their previous experiences and "other relevant factors" (Oguhci et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

== Measuring product lifetimes ==
Academic enquiry into the product lifetimes of electrical and electronic equipment was undertaken in 2000 by Cooper and Mayers&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/6671/|title=Prospects for household appliances|author1=Cooper, T.  |author2=Mayers, K.|publisher=Sheffield Hallam University for E-SCOPE|year=2000|isbn=|location=Sheffield|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who conducted household interviews and focus groups to establish the age at discard (actual product lifetime) and expected lifetimes for 17 products. Since this study, work has been undertaken by other academics into measuring actual and expected product lifetimes; the methods employed are outlined below.

=== Actual product lifetimes ===
Actual product lifetimes can be measured using a variety of methods which include: product testing, discard surveys, user interviews and modelling. These are discussed below.

==== Product testing ====
Products can be tested under laboratory conditions to assess their lifetime under different conditions of use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Discard surveys ====
Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; identify that surveys of waste treatment and recycling facilities can provide information on the age of the appliance at break or discard. Identifying information such as the product serial and/ or batch number can be used to find out a date of manufacturer from which the age of the appliance at break or discard can be calculated.

==== User interviews ====
Cooper and Mayers&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; conducted household [[interview]]s to establish the age of 17 electrical and electronic items at discard and break. However it has been noted that user interviews are subject to the accuracy of [[memory]], and that reviews of products which have failed in the past only provides information on "a historical situation" (:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;10), not taking into account the features and lifetime of extant products.

Product lifetimes can be modelled using extant data from surveys with the application of [[probability]] and other [[Statistics|statistical concepts]] (e.g. [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]]).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www4.ntu.ac.uk/plate_conference/proceedings/index.html|title=Product Lifetimes and The Environment|last=Oguchi, M.|publisher=Nottingham Trent University|year=2015|isbn=|location=Nottingham|pages=388–393|chapter=Methodologies for estimating actual lifetime distribution of products|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest attempts to estimate product lifetimes was undertaken by Pennock and Jaeger&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pennock|first=Jean L.|last2=Jaeger|first2=Carol M.|date=1957-06-01|title=Estimating the Service Life of Household Goods by Actuarial Methods|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1957.10501377|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=52|issue=278|pages=175–185|doi=10.1080/01621459.1957.10501377|issn=0162-1459}}&lt;/ref&gt; who utilised actuarial methods to measure the [[Service life]] of household goods for one owner.

Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; outlined a series of equations which represent lifespan distributions for a given product at a particular point in time.

=== Expected product lifetimes ===
Expected product lifetimes are measured at the individual level using survey methods and collectively using focus groups. With the exception of Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Wieser et al.,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; many studies into expected product lifetimes have not distinguished between the different definitions (outlined above). The methods for measuring expected product lifetimes are outlined below.

==== Survey methods ====
Survey methods into expected product lifetimes encompass [[Online Questionnaires|online questionnaires]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; household&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and telephone&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Echegaray|first=Fabián|date=2016-10-15|title=Consumers' reactions to product obsolescence in emerging markets: the case of Brazil|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652615012202|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|series=Special Volume: Transitions to Sustainable Consumption and Production in Cities|volume=134, Part A|pages=191–203|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.08.119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[interview]]s. These studies asked individual participants to report their expectations for product lifetimes in units of time. Survey methods (such as Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) can also use [[Likert scale|Likert items]] to evaluate if current products meet users expectations with regards to durability and longevity.

==== Focus groups ====
[[Focus group]]s can be convened where participants take part in discussions to reach a group consensus on product lifetime expectations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3971">'''''Profanum''''' is the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for "profane".  The distinction between [[the sacred and the profane]] was considered by [[Émile Durkheim]] to be central to the social reality of human [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile (1976). ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'', p. 37. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin (originally published 1915, English translation 1915).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacred/profane==

The profane world consists of all that we can know through our senses; it is the natural world of everyday life that we experience as either comprehensible or at least ultimately knowable — the ''[[Lebenswelt]]'' or lifeworld.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger, ''A Rumour of Angels'' (1973) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the sacred, or ''sacrum'' in Latin, encompasses all that exists beyond the everyday, natural world that we experience with our senses. As such, the sacred or [[numinous]] can inspire feelings of awe, because it is regarded as ultimately unknowable and beyond limited human abilities to perceive and comprehend. Durkheim pointed out however that there are degrees of sacredness, so that an [[amulet]] for example may be sacred yet little respected.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transitions==

[[Rites of passage]] represent movements from one state — the profane – to the other, the sacred; or back again to the profanum.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion is organized primarily around the sacred elements of human life and provides a collective attempt to bridge the gap between the sacred and the profane.

==Profane progress==
Modernization and the [[Enlightenment era|Enlightenment]] project have led to a [[secularisation]] of culture over the past few centuries – an extension of the profanum at the (often explicit) expense of the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fredric Jameson]], ''The Jameson Reader'' (2005) p. 180-1&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant 21st-century global world view is as a result empirical, sensate, contractual, this-worldly – in short profane.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]] expressed the same thought more subjectively when he wrote that “I know – and here I am expressing what countless other people know – that the present time is the time of God's disappearance and death”.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counter reaction==

The advance of the profane has led to several countermovements, attempting to limit the scope of the profanum. [[Modernism]] set out to bring [[Mythology|myth]] and a sense of the sacred back into secular reality&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, p. 180-2&lt;/ref&gt; — [[Wallace Stevens]] speaking for much of the movement when he wrote that “if nothing was divine then all things were, the world itself”.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Stevens, ''Collected Poems'' (1984) p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fundamentalism]] – Christian, Muslim, or other – set its face against the profanum with a return to sacred writ.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco. ''Turning Back the Clock'' (2007) pp. 218–20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychology]] too has set out to protect the [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]] of the individual self from profane intrusion,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''The Psychology of Human Destiny'' (1974) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; establishing ritual places for inward work&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly, ''Iron John'' (1991) p. 194 and p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; in opposition to the [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] loss of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Eco, p. 77-88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==
[[Seamus Heaney]] considered that “the desacralizing of space is something that my generation experienced in all kinds of ways”.&lt;ref&gt;Denis O'Driscoll, ''Stepping Stones'' (2008) p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', one of the topics treated by [[Aristotle]] is about how the study carried out by mathematicians differs from that carried out by physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lear|first1=Jonathan|title=Aristotle: the desire to understand|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Before giving a [[mathematical proof]] for the formula for the [[volume]] of a [[sphere]], [[Archimedes]] used physical reasoning to discover the solution (imagining the balancing of bodies on a scale).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Mazer|title=The Ellipse: A Historical and Mathematical Journey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twWkDe1Y9YQC&amp;pg=SA5-PA28|date=26 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-21143-4|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the seventeenth century, many of the most important advances in mathematics appeared motivated by the study of physics, and this continued in the following centuries (although, it has already been appointed that from the nineteenth century, mathematics started to become increasingly independent from physics).&lt;ref name="post"&gt;E. J.

== Philosophical problems ==
Some of the problems considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] are the following:

*Explain the effectiveness of mathematics in the study of the physical world: "At this point an enigma presents itself which in all ages has agitated inquiring minds. How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?" —[[Albert Einstein]], in ''Geometry and Experience'' (1921).&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein]], [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Einstein_geometry.html Geometry and Experience].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Clearly delineate mathematics and physics: For some results or discoveries, it is difficult to say to which area they belong: to the mathematics or to physics.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bergé, [https://books.google.com/books?id=umFTtQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Des+rythmes+au+chaos%22&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=65aEU7LAKeHL8AHc74HwBg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA Des rythmes au chaos].&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is the geometry of physical space?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Carl Hatfield|title=The Natural and the Normative: Theories of Spatial Perception from Kant to Helmholtz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JikeeDbYeUQC&amp;pg=PA223|year=1990|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-08086-6|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is the origin of the axioms of mathematics?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gila Hanna|author2=Hans Niels Jahnke|author3=Helmut Pulte|title=Explanation and Proof in Mathematics: Philosophical and Educational Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bLHye8kSAwC&amp;pg=PA29|date=4 December 2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-0576-5|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*How does the already existing mathematics influence in the creation and development of [[Theoretical physics#Overview|physical theories]]?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fqxi.org/community/essay/rules |title=FQXi Community Trick or Truth: the Mysterious Connection Between Physics and Mathematics |access-date=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is arithmetic ''a priori'' or synthetic? (from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], see [[Analytic–synthetic distinction]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Van Cleve Professor of Philosophy Brown University|title=Problems from Kant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6WHAgt-Mg1AC&amp;pg=PA22|date=16 July 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-534701-2|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*What is essentially different between doing a physical experiment to see the result and making a mathematical calculation to see the result? (from the [[Alan Turing|Turing]]–[[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] debate)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ludwig Wittgenstein|author2=R. G. Bosanquet|author3=Cora Diamond|title=Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics, Cambridge, 1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4YUZVq1JSEC&amp;pg=PA96|date=15 October 1989|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-90426-9|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Do [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] imply that physical theories will always be incomplete? (from [[Stephen Hawking]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Pavel|last=Pudlák|title=Logical Foundations of Mathematics and Computational Complexity: A Gentle Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=obxDAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA659|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-319-00119-7|page=659}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawking.org.uk/godel-and-the-end-of-physics.html Stephen Hawking. "Godel and the End of the Universe"]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Is math invented or discovered? (millennium-old question, raised among others by [[Mario Livio]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Mario Livio | authorlink = Mario Livio| doi =  | title = Why math works? | journal = Scientific American | volume =  | pages = 80–83 | year = August 2011 | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-math-works/| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
In recent times the two disciplines have most often been taught separately, despite all the interrelations between physics and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Karam; Pospiech; &amp; Pietrocola (2010). "[http://www.univ-reims.fr/site/evenement/girep-icpe-mptl-2010-reims-international-conference/gallery_files/site/1/90/4401/22908/29476/30505.pdf Mathematics in physics lessons: developing structural skills]"&lt;/ref&gt; This led some professional mathematicians who were also interested in [[mathematics education]], such as [[Felix Klein]], [[Richard Courant]], [[Vladimir Arnold]] and [[Morris Kline]], to strongly advocate teaching mathematics in a way more closely related to the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Stakhov "[http://www2.fisica.unlp.edu.ar/materias/algebralineal/documentos/mathharm.pdf Dirac’s Principle of Mathematical Beauty, Mathematics of Harmony]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Lesh|author2=Peter L.

[[File:RoySocChem 5770.jpg|thumb|right|266px|RSC London Headquarters]]
The '''Royal Society of Chemistry''' ('''RSC''') is a [[learned society]] ([[professional association]]) in the [[United Kingdom]] with the goal of "advancing the [[chemistry|chemical]] sciences". It was formed in 1980 from the amalgamation of the [[Chemical Society]], the [[Royal Institute of Chemistry]], the [[Faraday Society]], and the [[Society for Analytical Chemistry]] with a new Royal Charter and the dual role of learned society and professional body. At its inception, the Society had a combined membership of 34,000 in the UK and a further 8,000 abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/History/ABriefHistory.asp |title=RSC History |publisher=Rsc.org |date= 2014-04-02|accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of the Society are at [[Burlington House]], [[Piccadilly]], [[London]].  It also has offices in Thomas Graham House in [[Cambridge]] (named after [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]], the first president of the [[Chemical Society]]) where ''RSC Publishing'' is based. The Society has offices in the [[United States]] at the [[University City Science Center]], [[Philadelphia]], in both [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Bangalore]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/contacts/ |title=RSC Contacts |publisher=Rsc.org |date= 2014-04-16|accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The organisation carries out research, publishes [[academic journal|journals]], books and databases, as well as hosting conferences, seminars and workshops.  It is the professional body for chemistry in the UK, with the ability to award the status of [[Chartered Chemist]] (CChem) and, through the Science Council the awards of Chartered Scientist (CSci), Registered Scientist (RSci) and Registered Science Technician (RScTech) to suitably qualified candidates.  The designation FRSC is given to a group of elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry|Fellows of the society]] who have made major contributions to chemistry and other interface disciplines such as biological chemistry.  The names of Fellows are published each year in ''[[The Times]]'' (London). [[Honorary Fellows of the Royal Society of Chemistry|Honorary Fellowship of the Society]] ("HonFRSC") is awarded for distinguished service in the field of chemistry.

== President ==

The president is elected biennially and wears a badge in the form of a spoked wheel, with the standing figure of Joseph Priestley depicted in enamel, mainly in red and blue, on a hexagonal medallion in the centre. The rim of the wheel is gold, and the twelve spokes are of non-tarnishable metals.

The current president is Sir [[John Holman (chemist)|John Holman]] (2016–2018).&lt;ref name="RSC2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/news-events/rsc-news/articles/2015/jun/election-results-2015/|title=2015 RSC Elections|website=Rsc.org|date=15 June 2015|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualification ''GRSC'' (Graduate of the Royal Society of Chemistry) was awarded from 1981 to 1995 for completion of college courses equivalent to an honours chemistry degree and overseen by the RSC.&lt;ref name=GRSC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/images/GraduateQualificationsChemistry_tcm18-94249.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619185400/http://rsc.org/images/GraduateQualificationsChemistry_tcm18-94249.pdf |archivedate=19 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It replaced the GRIC offered by the Royal Institute of Chemistry.

== Divisions ==
The society is organised around 9 divisions, based on subject areas, and local sections, both in the United Kingdom and overseas.  Divisions cover broad areas of chemistry but also contain many special interest groups for more specific areas.

* ''Analytical Division'' for [[analytical chemistry]] and promoting the original aims of the ''Society for Analytical Chemistry''. 12 Subject Groups.
* ''Dalton Division'', named after [[John Dalton]], for [[inorganic chemistry]]. 6 Subject Groups.
* ''Education Division'' for [[Chemistry education|chemical education]]. 4 Subject Groups.
* ''Faraday Division'', named after [[Michael Faraday]], for [[physical chemistry]] and promoting the original aims of the ''Faraday Society''. 14 Subject Groups.
* ''Organic Division'' for [[organic chemistry]]. 6 Subject Groups.
* ''Chemical Biology Interface Division''. 2 Subject Groups.
* ''Environment, Sustainability and Energy Division''. 3 Subject Groups.
* ''Materials Chemistry Division''. 4 Subject Groups.
* ''Industry and Technology Division''. 13 Subject Groups.

There are 12 subjects groups not attached to a division.

== Local sections ==
There are 35 local sections covering the United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and many other countries there are Local Representatives of the society and often some activities.

== Publications ==

[[File:Thomas Graham House - 2014-10-09 - Andy Mabbett - 03.JPG|thumb|Thomas Graham House – from where the Society's publishing arm operates – in 2014]]

The society is a [[not for profit|not-for-profit]] publisher: surplus made by its publishing business is invested to support its aim of advancing the chemical sciences.

In addition to [[scientific journals]], including its flagship journals ''[[Chemical Communications]]'', [[Chemical Science (journal)|''Chemical Science'']] and ''[[Chemical Society Reviews]]'', the society publishes:

* ''[[Education in Chemistry]]'' for teachers.
* A free online journal for chemistry educators, ''[[Chemistry Education Research and Practice]]''.
* A general chemistry magazine ''[[Chemistry World]]'',  sent monthly to all members of the Society throughout the world. The editorial board consists of 10 academic and industrial chemists. It was first published in January 2004. It replaced ''Chemistry in Britain'', first published in 1965. Its contents include news, articles of a general chemical nature, such as the history of chemistry and technological developments, book reviews and letters from readers. Its ISSN is 1473-7604. ''[[Chemistry World]]'' is supported by the ''Chemistry World Podcast'', which is presented by Cambridge University scientist [[Chris Smith (doctor)|Dr Chris Smith]], who also edits ''[[The Naked Scientists]]''.
* Professional reference books across the chemical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/Shop/books/series/index.asp |title=Series |website=Rsc.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Books for students, including the ''Tutorial Chemistry Texts'' series of 23 books, edited by E. W. Abel, and the 8 books in the ''Molecular World'' series, whose coordinating editor is L. E. Smart.
* Books on the history of chemistry, such as a history of the [[Faraday Society]].

Subscriptions to the journals are available individually, or "all-in", under a provision called "RSC Gold".&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/librarians/RSC_Gold.asp|title=RSC Gold|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=18 December 2014|date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[London]] offices of the Society are in [[Burlington House]], Piccadilly. Events are hosted here for the public, RSC member groups and external organisations including monthly lectures on the chemical sciences that streamed live via the RSC's public engagement website – the Reaction. The free lectures take an interesting look at the chemical aspects of a wide range of topics from curry to the enjoyment of music.

The events have attracted notable science writers such as [[Philip Ball]], [[Antony John Williams]], and [[John Emsley]] to give public lectures. Most of these are available as archived video streams via the RSC's Reaction website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thereaction.net/events/ |title=Reaction articles |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324234320/http://thereaction.net/events/ |archivedate=24 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
Although opened as the Chemistry Centre in 2010, the building has been occupied by the Royal Society of Chemistry since 1857 (at which time it was known as the Chemical Society) – the heart of the Chemistry Centre is the RSC's Library and Information Centre which itself dates back to 1842. Over the years, the library for the RSC has received many gifts from notable fellows including [[Michael Faraday]]. The library became a centre for information on the chemical sciences during the 1st and 2nd world wars when extensive use was made on the chemical reference material available. In November 2014, the society announced that the centre would be rebranded as simply "Royal Society of Chemistry at Burlington House" and the name "Chemistry Centre" dropped.

== Library and information centre ==
The society has a large library covering mainly chemistry-based subjects, including online access for members, housed at the Chemistry Centre at Burlington House. It is part of the Chemistry Centre and is a resource for RSC members, although the public are also welcome.

The Chemists' Community Fund, the working name of the Royal Society of Chemistry's Benevolent Fund, supports the members and their families during difficult times, through advice and guidance, financial and volunteer support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/awards-funding/funding/benevolent-fund/ |title=Chemists' Community Fund - formerly the Benevolent Fund - Royal Society of Chemistry |website=Rsc.org |date= 2016-04-27|accessdate=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It dates back to 1920 when the Institute of Chemistry (later the [[Royal Institute of Chemistry]]) established it as a memorial to its members who died in the First World War. It had an aim "to help necessitous persons who are, or have been, Fellows or Associates of the Institute, their wives or children, and the widows and dependent relatives of deceased Fellows and Associates" through voluntary contributions from members. The Fund's ethos of "members helping members" stems from the Institute of Chemistry's Council raising money for members in need from other members prior to the fund being formed.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Benevolent Fund|url=http://www.rsc.org/Membership/Benefits/BenFund/aboutus/history.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123081459/http://www.rsc.org/Membership/Benefits/BenFund/aboutus/history.asp|archivedate=2008|date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the benevolent fund introduced a volunteer visitor system, where members were asked to visit applicants, beneficiaries, elderly and housebound members in their area. Each local section was also appointed a fund representative.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A major review of the fund to modernize it took place in 2003–2004, forming a new strategy document that is updated every three years. It underwent another review in 2014 with the aim to widen its reach to include the prevention of poverty and provide a more holistic support wider than financial assistance to Royal Society of Chemistry members and their families.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The Benevolent Fund Grants Committee, formed of volunteer members of the Royal Society of Chemistry, oversees the fund and meets every three months.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Prizes and awards ==
{{Main|List of Royal Society of Chemistry medals and awards}}

The RSC awards a variety of prizes and awards each year that include awards for excellence in any area of chemistry, in specialist areas or for achievement at particular stages of a chemist's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/ |title=RSC prizes and awards |publisher=Rsc.org |date= 2014-04-02|accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medals are awarded centrally by the RSC and by the divisions of the organisation. There are also awards that are administered by RSC interest groups.

The centrally awarded medals include the [[Harrison-Meldola Memorial Prizes]] which are awarded to a British chemist who is under 32 years of age for promising original investigations in chemistry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/HarrisonMeldolaMemorialPrizes/Index.asp |title=Harrison-Meldola Memorial Prize |publisher=Rsc.org |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Corday-Morgan medal]]s which consist of three separate awards made for the most meritorious contributions to experimental chemistry (including computer simulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/CordayMorganPrizes/Index.asp |title=Corday-Morgan Prizes |publisher=Rsc.org |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tilden Prize]], previously known as the Tilden Lecture, consists of three awards annually to scientists in mid-career for advances in chemistry.

Previous winners of the Harrison-Meldola Prize (known as the [[Meldola Medal and Prize]] prior to its merger in 2008 with the Edward Harrison prize) include [[Christopher Kelk Ingold]] (1921, 1922), [[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood]] (1923), R.H. Stokes (1946), D.H. Williams (1966), and J. Evans (1978).

Corday-Morgan medal recipients include [[Derek Harold Richard Barton|Derek Barton]] (1949), [[Ronald Sydney Nyholm]] (1950), [[Frederick Sanger]] (1951), [[John Cornforth]] (1953), [[Rex Richards (scientist)|Rex Richards]] (1954), and [[George Porter]] (1955).

The Faraday Division annually awards the [[Marlow Award]] for contributions to [[physical chemistry]] or [[chemical physics]] by members of the Faraday Division under the age of 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/MarlowAward/Index.asp |title=Marlow Award |publisher=Rsc.org |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent recipients include [[Andrew Orr-Ewing]], (1999), [[Jonathan A. Jones]], (2000), [[Helen Fielding (Chemist)|Helen Fielding]] (2001), [[Jonathan Essex]] (2002), [[Daren Caruana]] (2003), [[Jonathan Reid (chemist)|Jonathan Reid]] (2004), [[Julie Macpherson]] (2005), [[Fred Manby]] (2006), and [[Alessandro Troisi]] (2007).

==Coat of arms==
The RSC has its own [[coat of arms]]. Two forms exist: the full coat of arms has lion and unicorn bearers, and the [[Latin]] motto "''{{lang|la|Pro scientia et humanitate}}''" (For the sake of knowledge and for the benefit of mankind). The smaller version uses just the central shield, which is similar to that in the [[Royal Institute of Chemistry]]'s arms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3354">The '''School of Antioch''' was one of the two major centers of the study of biblical [[exegesis]] and [[theology]] during [[Late Antiquity]]; the other was the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]]. This group was known by this name because the advocates of this tradition were based in the city of [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]], one of the major cities of the ancient [[Roman Empire]]. 

While the Christian intellectuals of Alexandria emphasized the [[allegorical]] interpretation of Scriptures and tended toward a [[Christology]] that emphasized the union of the human and the divine, those in Antioch held to a more literal and occasionally [[Typology (theology)|typological]] exegesis and a Christology that emphasized the distinction between the human and the divine in the person of [[Jesus Christ]]. The school in general tended to what might be called, in a rather loose sense, an [[Adoptionism|Adoptionist]] Christology.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Adoptianism''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nestorius]], before becoming Patriarch of Constantinople, had been a monk at Antioch and had there become imbued with the principles of the Antiochene theological school.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Nestorius''&lt;/ref&gt;

The school of Antioch is best divided into three periods: 
* the early school (170-early fourth century)
The earliest author known of this period is [[Theophilus of Antioch]]. Then there is a gap of a century and in the first half of the fifth century there are three known antiochene authors: the best known is [[Eusebius of Emesa]]; other representatives are [[Acacius of Caesarea]] and Theodore bishop of Heraklea.
* the middle school (350-433)
This period includes at least three different generations: [[Diodorus of Tarsus]], who directed an ἀσκητήριον (school) he may have founded. Among his disciples, the best known are [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Theodore of Mopsuestia|Theodorus of Mopsuestia]]. The main figure of the third generation was [[Nestorius]].
* the late school (after 433).
After the [[Council of Ephesus]] (431), the School of Antioch loses prestige. However, after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451), the Antiochian school becomes the sole theological school within [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern]] and [[Roman Catholic|Western]] Christianity, where the [[Oriental Orthodox|Far-Eastern Churches]] adopted the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria|Alexandrian School of Theology]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Apparently only two later authors are known: [[Basil of Seleucia]] and [[Gennadius of Constantinople]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

:''See also [[Titulus (Roman Catholic)]] for Roman churches called tituli, or [[titulus (disambiguation)]] for more meanings.''

'''''Titulus''''' (Latin "inscription" or "label", the plural ''tituli'' is also used in English) is a term used for the labels or captions naming figures or subjects in art, which were commonly added in classical and [[medieval art]], and remain conventional in [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s.  In particular the term describes the conventional inscriptions on stone that listed the honours of an individual&lt;ref&gt;[[William Smith (lexicographer)|Smith, William]] (1875). [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Nobiles.html "Nobiles"]. ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]''. London. Reprinted by [[The University of Chicago]].&lt;/ref&gt; or that identified boundaries in the [[Roman Empire]].  A [[Titulus pictus]] is a [[merchant's mark]] or other commercial inscription.

The sense of "title", as in "book title", in modern English derives from this artistic sense, just as the [[Title (property)|legal sense]] derives from plainer inscriptions of record.&lt;ref&gt;"Title", ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous titulus was "IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM" inscribed on the placard hanging above [[Jesus]]' head on the [[Cross]]. 

==Use in Western art==
The increasing reluctance of the art of the West to use ''tituli'' was perhaps because so few people could read them in the [[Early Medieval]] period, and later because they reduced the illusionism of the image. Instead a system of [[Emblem|attributes]], objects identifying popular saints, was developed, but many such figures in Western art are now unidentifiable.  This reluctance affected the choice of scenes shown in art; only those [[miracles of Jesus]] that were easily identifiable visually tended to be shown in cycles of the ''[[Life of Christ]]''.  Thus the ''[[Raising of Lazarus]]'' and ''[[Wedding at Cana]]'' are by far the most commonly shown miracles, and the healing miracles, visually easy to confuse, are neglected.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, 152–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mâle, 177&lt;/ref&gt;  The problems can clearly be seen in the small scenes of the [[Saint Augustine Gospels]] (late 6th century), where about 200 years after the manuscript was written ''tituli'' were added, which according to some art historians misidentify some scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Lewine, Carol F.; [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3049296 JSTOR] ''Vulpes Fossa Habent or the Miracle of the Bent Woman in the Gospels of St. Augustine'', Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,&lt;/ref&gt; [[Banderole (speech scroll)|Banderole]]s were a solution that became popular in the later [[Middle Ages]], and in Northern Europe in the 15th century were sometimes used very extensively for speech, rather as in modern comics, as well as ''tituli''.  These were abandoned as old-fashioned in the [[Renaissance]], but increased respect for classical traditions led to continued use of Ancient Roman-style ''tituli'' where they were considered necessary, including on portraits.

==Examples of tituli==
*In the context of the [[Crucifixion]], the ''titulus'' "{{sc2|IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM}}" (and its translations) is believed to have been affixed to Jesus' cross. ''INRI'' is the abbreviation for the above-mentioned Latin translation.  See [[INRI]] and [[Titulus Crucis]].
*At the recovery of the coffin of [[King Arthur]] at [[Glastonbury Abbey]], at an opportune moment after a devastating fire in the 12th century, a lead cross of Arthur was alleged to have borne the explicit ''titulus'' "{{sc2|HIC JACET SEPULTUS INCLITUS REX ARTHURUS IN INSULA AVALONIA}}". The well-publicized discovery described by [[Giraldus Cambrensis]], redoubled the pilgrimages to the Abbey.

The '''University of Edinburgh School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences''' is a school within the College of Humanities and Social Science at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. The School was formed in 2002 as a result of administrative restructuring, when several departments of what was then the Faculty of Arts were brought together. The University of Edinburgh's academic foundation is based on three Colleges containing a total of 22 Schools;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/introduction&lt;/ref&gt; among these is the School of Philosophy, Psychology, and Language Sciences (PPLS).

The School is composed of three subject areas:
* [[Philosophy]] (ranked 4th in the UK (29th in the world)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/overall.asp |title=Philosophical Gourmet Report |access-date=22 August 2007 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100813142000/http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/overall.asp |archive-date=13 August 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Psychology]] (ranked 5th in the UK  (37th in the world)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2011/subject-rankings/life-sciences/psychology|2011 QS World University survey]&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Linguistics]] and English Language (LEL) (ranked 1st in the UK in internationally leading research&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2008/dec/18/rae-results-2008-linguistics|2008 RAE]&lt;/ref&gt;)

It also houses much of the [[Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Ourresearch/ResearchInitiatives/LLHW/ Cross-council Lifelong Health and Well-being initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the School, research in Psychology is organized along 3 broad themes:

* Differential Psychology, which looks at individual differences in the way people think, behave, and feel emotions differently.
* Human Cognitive Neuroscience, which studies memory, attention, executive function, visual memory, sensory integration, and perceptuo-motor control in adults who function normally and those who possess disorders within the nervous system.
* Language Cognition and Communication, which covers topics in linguistic comprehension,  understanding, invention and conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research: Psychology|url=http://www.psy.ed.ac.uk/psy_research/index.php|publisher=University of Edinburgh|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''W. M. Keck Observatory''' is a two-telescope [[astronomical observatory]] at an elevation of 4,145 meters (13,600&amp;nbsp;ft) near the summit of [[Mauna Kea]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]]. Both telescopes feature {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} primary mirrors, currently among the [[List of largest optical reflecting telescopes|largest astronomical telescopes]] in use. 

== Overview ==
With a concept first proposed in 1977, telescope designers at the [[University of California]] (Terry Mast) and [[Lawrence Berkeley Labs]] ([[Jerry Nelson (astronomer)|Jerry Nelson]]) had been developing the technology necessary to build a large, ground-based telescope. With a design in hand, a search for the funding began. In 1985, [[Howard B. Keck]] of the [[W. M. Keck Foundation]] gave $70 million to fund the construction of the Keck&amp;nbsp;I telescope. Construction of Keck I began in September 1985, with first light occurring on 24 November 1990 using only nine of the eventual 36 segments. With construction of the first telescope well advanced, further donations allowed the construction of a second telescope starting in 1991. The Keck&amp;nbsp;I telescope began science observations in May 1993, while first light for Keck II occurred on October 23, 1996.

[[Image:KeckObservatory20071013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|The Keck II telescope showing the [[Segmented mirror|segmented]] primary mirror]]

The key advance that allowed the construction of the Keck Observatory's large telescopes was the ability to operate smaller [[Segmented mirror|mirror segments]] as a single, contiguous mirror. In the case of the Keck Observatory telescopes each of the primary mirrors is composed of 36 hexagonal segments that work together as a single unit. Each segment is 1.8 meters wide, 7.5 centimeters thick, and weighs half a ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Keck Revolution in Telescope Design Pioneered at Lawrence Berkeley Lab |author=Lynn Yarris |date=1992 |url=http://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/keck-telescope.html |accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mirrors were made from [[Zerodur]] [[glass-ceramic]] by the German company [[Schott AG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schott.com/ft/german/download/zeak13_fb0309.pdf |title=ZERODUR for Large Segmented Telescopes |publisher=SCHOTT Glas|author=Hans F. Morian|author2=Peter Hartmann|author3=Ralf Jedamzik|author4=Hartmut W. Höneß}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the telescope, each segment is kept stable by a system of [[active optics]], which uses extremely rigid support structures in combination with three actuators under each segment. During observation, the computer-controlled system of sensors and actuators adjusts the position of each segment, relative to its neighbors, to an accuracy of four [[nanometer]]s. This twice-per-second adjustment counters the effect of gravity as the telescope moves, in addition to other environmental and structural effects that can affect the mirror shape.

Each Keck Observatory telescope sits on an [[altazimuth mount|altazimuth]] mount. Most current 8–10 m class telescopes use altazimuth designs due to the reduced structural requirements compared to older [[Equatorial mount|equatorial designs]]. This mounting style provides the greatest strength and stiffness for the least amount of steel, which, for Keck Observatory, totals about 270&amp;nbsp;tons per telescope. The total weight of each telescope is more than 300&amp;nbsp;tons. Two of the [[Thirty Meter Telescope|proposed designs]] for the next generation 30 and 40&amp;nbsp;m telescopes use the same basic technology pioneered at Keck Observatory, a hexagonal mirror array coupled with an altazimuth mounting.

The primary mirrors of each of the two telescopes are 10 meters (32.8&amp;nbsp;ft or 394&amp;nbsp;in) in diameter, slightly smaller than the [[Gran Telescopio Canarias]]. However, all of the light collected by the Keck Observatory primary mirrors (75.76&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is sent to the secondary mirror and the instruments, compared to GTC's primary mirror, which has an effective light-collection area of 73.4&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or 25.4 square feet less than each of the Keck Observatory primary mirrors. Because of this fundamental difference in design, Keck Observatory's telescopes arguably remain the largest steerable, optical/infrared telescopes on Earth.

The telescopes are equipped with a suite of instruments, both [[camera]]s and [[spectrometers]] that allow observations across much of the visible and near infrared spectrum.

== Management ==

The Keck Observatory is managed by the California Association for Research in Astronomy, a non-profit [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] organization whose board of directors includes representatives from [[Caltech]] and the [[University of California]]. Construction of the telescopes was made possible through private grants totaling more than $140 million provided by the W. M. Keck Foundation. The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)]] joined the partnership in October 1996, at the time Keck&amp;nbsp;II commenced observations.

Telescope time is allocated by the partner institutions. Caltech, the University of Hawaii System, and the University of California accept proposals from their own researchers. NASA accepts proposals from researchers based in the United States.

[[Jerry Nelson (astronomer)|Jerry Nelson]] was the project scientist for the Keck Telescope, and he also contributed to later multi-mirror projects until he died in June 2017. Nelson was behind one of the key innovations of the Keck telescope, the use of multiple thin segments acting as one mirror to provide the reflecting surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/in-memoriam-jerry-nelson-legendary-telescope-designer/|title=In Memoriam: Jerry Nelson, Legendary Telescope Designer|last=Lewis|first=Hilton|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instruments ==

; MOSFIRE : MOSFIRE (''Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://irlab.astro.ucla.edu/mosfire/|title=MOSFIRE science based capabilities|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a third generation instrument for the W. M. Keck Observatory. MOSFIRE was delivered to Keck Observatory on February 8, 2012 and first light on the Keck I telescope was obtained on April 4, 2012. A Multi-Object [[Spectrograph]] For Infra-Red Exploration and wide-field camera for the near-infrared (0.97 to 2.41 μm), MOSFIRE's special feature is the cryogenic Configurable Slit Unit (CSU) that is reconfigurable under remote control in less than 6 minutes without any thermal cycling. Bars move in from each side to form up to 46 short slits. When the bars are removed MOSFIRE becomes a wide-field imager. The instrument was developed by teams from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] ([[UCLA]]), the California Institute of Technology ([[Caltech]]) and the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], (UCSC). The Co- Principal Investigators are Ian S. McLean ([[UCLA]]) and [[Charles C. Steidel]] (Caltech), and the project was managed by WMKO Instrument Program Manager, Sean Adkins. MOSFIRE was funded in part by the Telescope System Instrumentation Program (TSIP), which is operated by AURA and funded by the National Science Foundation, and by a private donation to WMKO by Gordon and Betty Moore.&lt;ref&gt;http://irlab.astro.ucla.edu/mosfire/84460J.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
; DEIMOS : The Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object [[Spectrograph]] is capable of gathering spectra from 130 galaxies or more in a single exposure. In "Mega Mask" mode, DEIMOS can take spectra of more than 1,200 objects at once, using a special narrow-band filter.
; HIRES : The largest and most mechanically complex of the Keck Observatory's main instruments, the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer breaks up incoming light into its component colors to measure the precise intensity of each of thousands of color channels. Its spectral capabilities have resulted in many breakthrough discoveries, such as the detection of planets outside our solar system and direct evidence for a model of the [[Big Bang]] theory. This instrument has detected more [[extrasolar planets]] than any other in the world. The radial velocity precision is up to one meter per second (1.0&amp;nbsp;m/s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/discoveries/fop/ |title=Kepler Discoveries - About Follow-up Observations |publisher=[[NASA]]|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument detection limit at 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] is {{Jupiter mass|link=y|0.2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://202.127.29.4/bdep_meeting/download/talks/20July/4-AHoward.ppt |title=The NASA-UC Eta-Earth Survey At Keck Observatory |date=2010-10-16 |publisher=[[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] |accessdate=2015-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704072607/http://202.127.29.4/bdep_meeting/download/talks/20July/4-AHoward.ppt |archivedate=2011-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; KCWI : The Keck Cosmic Web Imager is an [[integral field spectrograph]] operating at wavelengths between 350 and 560 [[Nanometre|nm]].
; LRIS : The Low Resolution Imaging [[Spectrograph]] is a faint-light instrument capable of taking spectra and images of the most distant known objects in the universe. The instrument is equipped with a red arm and a blue arm to explore stellar populations of distant galaxies, [[active galactic nuclei]], [[galactic cluster]]s, and [[quasar]]s.
; LWS: The Long Wavelength Spectrometer for the Keck I telescope is and imaging, grating spectrometer working in the wavelength range of 3-25 micros. Like NIRC, the LWS was a forward-CASS instrument, and was used for studying cometary, planetary, and extragalactic objects.  The LWS is now retired from science observations.
; NIRC : The Near Infrared Camera for the Keck I telescope is so sensitive it could detect the equivalent of a single candle flame on the [[Moon]]. This sensitivity makes it ideal for ultra-deep studies of galactic formation and evolution, the search for [[galaxy formation and evolution|proto-galaxies]] and images of quasar environments. It has provided ground-breaking studies of the Galactic center, and is also used to study [[protoplanetary disk]]s, and high-mass [[star formation|star-forming regions]]. NIRC was retired from science observations in 2010.
; NIRC-2 : The second generation Near Infrared Camera works with the Keck Adaptive Optics system to produce the highest-resolution ground-based images and spectroscopy in the 1–5 micrometers (µm) range. Typical programs include mapping surface features on [[Solar System]] bodies, searching for planets around other stars, and analyzing the morphology of remote galaxies.
; NIRES : The Near-Infrared Echellette Spectrometer is a spectrograph that provides simultaneous coverage of wavelengths from 0.94 to 2.45 [[micron]]s.
; NIRSPEC : The Near Infrared Spectrometer studies very [[Redshift#Observations in astronomy|high redshift]] [[radio galaxy|radio galaxies]], the motions and types of stars located near the [[Galactic Center]], the nature of [[brown dwarf]]s, the nuclear regions of dusty starburst galaxies, active galactic nuclei, [[interstellar medium|interstellar]] chemistry, [[star|stellar]] physics, and Solar System science.
; [[OH-Suppressing Infrared Integral Field Spectrograph|OSIRIS]] : The OH-Suppressing Infrared Imaging Spectrograph is a [[near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infrared spectrograph]] for use with the Keck&amp;nbsp;I adaptive optics system. OSIRIS takes spectra in a small field of view to provide a series of images at different wavelengths. The instrument allows astronomers to ignore wavelengths where the [[Earth's atmosphere]] shines brightly due to emission from OH ([[hydroxyl]]) molecules, thus allowing the detection of objects 10 times fainter than previously available. Originally installed on Keck II, in January, 2012 OSIRIS was moved to the Keck 1 telescope.
; Keck Interferometer : The Interferometer allowed the light from both Keck telescopes to be combined into an {{convert|85|m|ft|adj=on}} baseline, near infrared, optical [[Optical interferometer|interferometer]]. This long baseline gave the interferometer an effective [[angular resolution]] of 5 [[milliarcsecond|milliarcseconds (mas)]] at 2.2&amp;nbsp;µm, and 24&amp;nbsp;mas at 10&amp;nbsp;µm. Several back-end instruments allowed the interferometer to operate in a variety of modes, operating in H, K, and L-band near infrared, as well as [[nulling interferometry]]. As of mid-2012 the Keck Interferometer has been discontinued for lack of funding. The instrument is currently in mothballed status and could be reactivated if funding permits.

Both Keck Observatory telescopes are equipped with [[laser guide star]] [[adaptive optics]], which compensates for the blurring due to [[astronomical seeing|atmospheric turbulence]]. The first AO system operational on a large telescope, the equipment has been constantly upgraded to expand the capability.
