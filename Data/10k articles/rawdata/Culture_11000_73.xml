{{nihongo|'''''.hack//Quantum'''''|ドットハック クワンタム|Dotto Hakku Kuwantamu}} is an animated three episode [[Original video animation|OVA]] series by [[Kinema Citrus]] studio in Japan and presented by Bandai Visual.   The series was initially scheduled to be released in November 2010, but this schedule was later changed. The first episode was released on January 28, 2011 with the following two episodes to be released in one month intervals.  Excluding the all-CGI animation movie ''[[.hack//G.U.|.hack//G.U. Trilogy]]'', this is the first animated OVA project to not be animated by long-time ''.hack'' producer [[Bee Train]] Productions Inc., nor directed by [[Koichi Mashimo]]. This project is also not related to a planned CGI movie tie-in to the newest game in the ''.hack'' series, ''[[.hack//Link]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-08-08/sunrise-koisento-sf-romantic-comedy-anime-revealed |title=Sunrise's Koisento SF Romantic Comedy Anime Revealed |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=2010-08-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815195413/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-08-08/sunrise-koisento-sf-romantic-comedy-anime-revealed |archivedate=15 August 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Masaki Tachibana of [[Tokyo Magnitude 8.0]] directed the OVA project and .hack// writer Tatsuya Hamazaki scripted. Kinema Citrus animated the series and Kow Otani composed the music score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hack.channel.or.jp/quantum/staff.html |title=Staff |publisher=hack.channel |accessdate=2010-08-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825104426/http://www.hack.channel.or.jp/quantum/staff.html |archivedate=2010-08-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Yuuka Nanri]] will be performing the theme song for .hack.Quantum. At [[Anime Weekend Atlanta]] 2011, [[Funimation]] announced that it had licensed the OVA series and it was released on DVD and Blu-ray on February 14, 2012, making it the first in the franchise not to be licensed by Bandai Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funimation Adds .hack//Quantum, Streams Guilty Crown|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-10-01/funimation-adds-.hack/quantum-streams-guilty-crown|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK release was published by [[MVM Entertainment]] on July 9, 2012.

==Story==
In 2022, the story follows three players – Sakuya, Tobias, and Mary – as they play the latest version of the world's largest [[MMORPG]]: "The World R:X", created by [[CC Corporation|Cyberconnect Corporation]]. When these three friends take on a quest as a party, they become caught in strange circumstances of fate.

===Main characters===
;{{nihongo|Asumi Aida|相田 亜澄|Aida Asumi}} / {{nihongo|Sakuya|サクヤ|Sakuya}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|[[Trina Nishimura]]}}
:A high school student living in [[Aomori, Aomori|Aomori]], who formed a party with three of her friends in "The World R:X". Her [[player character]], Sakuya, is based on the character Kite from the ''.hack'' games. Sakuya likes to say "Look before you jump" before charging off into dangerous places, and has a habit of picking up every item she stumbles across. Both Asumi and Sakuya share the same cheerful personality.

;{{nihongo|Iori Ikuta|生田 衣織|Ikuta Iori}} / {{nihongo|Tobias|トービアス|Tōbiasu}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Miyuki Sawashiro]]|[[Anastasia Muñoz]]}}
:Asumi and Eri's schoolmate. Her player character, Tobias, is based on the character Balmung from the ''.hack'' games. Also known as "Tobias the Informant", Tobias adventures with Sakuya with a pretty-boy look. She has a cool and calculating-nihilistic personality. In reality, Iori has an air of adulthood around her; and, unlike Tobias, she isn't picky about clothes, choosing practical wear over what is in-style.

;{{nihongo|Eri Etou|江藤 衿|Etō Eri}} / {{nihongo|Mary|メアリ|Meari}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Ayumi Fujimura]]|Lara Woodhull}}
:Childhood friend of Asumi, and schoolmate of both Asumi and Iori. Asumi is the one who got Eri into playing "The World". Her player character, Mary, is based on the character BlackRose from the ''.hack'' games. She adventures with Sakuya and Tobias. Her personality runs in contrast to the wild look of the Edge Punisher class.  She would many times be misled into doing two people's tasks. In reality, she is much more serious than her in-game counterpart.

Steinberg on July 23, 1954, in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], to a [[Russian-Jewish]] mother and a [[Polish-Jewish]] father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| url = http://shtetlmontreal.com/2011/02/18/dr-annie-sprinkle-on-shtetl/|title=Dr. Annie Sprinkle on ''Shtetl''|series=Shtetl: Your Alternative Jewish Magazine|airdate=February 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is known as the "prostitute and porn star turned sex educator and artist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seductive aesthetics of postcolonialism|first=Rekha|last=Menon|publisher=Hampton Press|date=May 1, 2010|quote="How can one miss, the ''Sex Goddess,'' Annie Sprinkle (the postporn modern artist), Tantric inspired cosmic Kali, Sprinkle as the Neo Sacred Prostitute / Goddess.

She then performed two-women shows with [[Elizabeth Stephens|Beth Stephens]] titled ''Exposed; Experiments in Love, Sex, Death and Art'', ''Dirty Sex Ecology'', ''Earthly: An Ecosex Bootcamp'', and ''Ecosex Walking Tour.''&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Lawrence &amp; [[Ellen Evert Hopman]] (1996) ''People of the Earth: The New Pagans Speak Out.''

Her work and publications, spanning over four decades, are studied in courses at numerous universities, in theater history, [[women's studies]], [[performance studies]], GLBTQ studies, and [[film studies]] courses. She also is a faculty member at the Oakland, California-based [[The New School of Erotic Touch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Vitzthum | first = Virginia | title = Annie Sprinkle swims forward | url = http://www.salon.com/health/col/vitz/2000/02/08/sprinkle/ | work = [[Salon.com]] | publisher = Salon Media Group | date = February 8, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Ellen Steinberg, Dr Sprinkle began working at the ticket booth at Tucson's Plaza Cinema at 18, when ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' was playing.&lt;ref name=rialto&gt;{{cite web | title = Annie Sprinkle: The Early Years (audio podcast interview) | url = http://www.therialtoreport.com/2013/04/07/podcast-05-annie-sprinkle-the-early-years/ | website = therialtoreport.com | publisher = The Rialto Report | date = April 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was busted, and when Steinberg had to appear in court as a witness, she met and fell in love with ''Deep Throat's'' director, [[Gerard Damiano]], and became his mistress, following him to New York City, where she lived for twenty-two years.&lt;ref name=rialto /&gt; Not long after becoming Damiano's mistress, Steinberg began working in porn herself and, at that time, started calling herself '''“Annie.”''' (Below can be found more details about the stage name she adopted.) Annie's first porn movie was ''Teenage Deviate,'' which was released in 1975. Perhaps her best known mainstream porn featured role was in ''Deep Inside Annie Sprinkle'' (co-directed by Sprinkle and sexploitation veteran [[Joseph W. Sarno]]) which was the No. 2 grossing porn film of 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=June 18, 2009|first=Reg|last=Little|work=Oxford Times|title=Iffley and the former porn star|url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/features/4435987.Iffley_and_the_former_porn_star/|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Annie Sprinkle Neo Sacred Prostitute.jpg|thumb|left|Artwork depicting Annie Sprinkle as "The Neo Sacred Prostitute" (own concept).]]
In 1991, Sprinkle created the ''Sluts and Goddesses'' workshop, which became the basis for her 1992 production ''The Sluts and Goddesses Video Workshop – Or How To Be A Sex Goddess in 101 Easy Steps,'' which was co-produced and co-directed with videographer [[Maria Beatty]], and featured music by composer [[Pauline Oliveros]]. Sprinkle pioneered new genres of sexually explicit film and video such as edu-porn, gonzo, post porn, xxx docudrama, art porn, and feminist erotica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chandler | first = Meghan | title = The erotic anatomies of Charles Estienne and Annie Sprinkle | journal = [[Porn Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 391–401 | doi = 10.1080/23268743.2014.958385 | date = October 2014 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sprinkle has also presented many sex workshops with fellow sex facilitator [[Barbara Carrellas]], with whom she presented the stage production ''Metamorphosex.''&lt;ref name="Rees1"/&gt;

She starred in [[Nick Zedd]]'s experimental films ''War Is Menstrual Envy'' (1992), ''Ecstasy in Entropy'' (1999), and ''Electra Elf: The Beginning'' (2005).

Dr Sprinkle has appeared in almost 200 films, including [[hard-core pornography|hard-]] and [[softcore pornography]], [[B movie]]s, loops, numerous documentaries, various TV shows including four [[HBO]] ''[[Real Sex]]'' programs. She has also produced, directed, and starred in several of her own films, such as ''Annie Sprinkle's Herstory of Porn,'' ''Annie Sprinkle's Amazing World of Orgasm,'' and ''Linda/Les &amp; Annie--The First Female to Male Transsexual Love Story.'' These films played in hundreds of film festivals, in museums and galleries. Her work in adult films earned her a spot on the Adult Star Path of Fame in [[Edison, New Jersey]], and she was inducted to both the [[List of members of the AVN Hall of Fame|AVN Hall of Fame]]&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Starr |first1=Astoria |title=13 AVN Hall of Fame 80's and 90's Stars: Where Are They Now? |url=https://www.therichest.com/expensive-lifestyle/entertainment/13-avn-hall-of-fame-80s-and-90s-stars-where-are-they-now/ |date=12 May 2016 |publisher=therichest.com |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[XRCO Hall of Fame]] in 1999. For three decades, she has presented her work as a visiting artist at many major universities and colleges in the US and Europe. Currently her lecture presentation is called "My Life and Work as a Feminist Porn Activist, Radical Sex Educator, and Ecosexual." She has also presented dozens of "Free Sidewalk Sex Clinics," offering free sex education to the public in public space.

Dr Sprinkle's work has always been about sexuality, with a political, spiritual, and artistic bent. In December 2005, she committed to doing seven years of art projects about love with her art collaborator and eventual wife, Beth Stephens. They called this their ''Love Art Laboratory.'' Part of their project was to do an experimental art wedding each year, and each year had a different theme and color. The seven-year structure was adapted to their project by invitation of artist [[Linda Montano|Linda M. Montano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Benn |first=D. |title=Annie Sprinkle on the Adult Star Path of Fame: 43 Stars Laid in New Jersey |url=http://www.pornonewsnetwork.com/news.php?id=863 |website=pornonewsnetwork.com |publisher=Porno News Network |date=2006 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sprinkle and Stephens have done twenty-one art weddings, eighteen with ecosexual themes. They married the Earth, Sky, Sea, Moon, Appalachian Mountains, the Sun, and other non-human entities in nine different countries.

Dr Sprinkle and her partner [[Beth Stephens]] became pioneers of ecosexuality, a kind of earth-loving sexual identity, which states, “The Earth is our lover.” Their Ecosex Manifesto proclaims that anyone can identify as an Ecosexual along with being “GLBTQI, heterosexual, asexual, and/or Other.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://sexecology.org/research-writing/ecosex-manifesto/ | title=Ecosex Manifesto | accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Sprinkle has also long championed sex worker rights and health care. She has also worked as a prostitute from 1973-1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Bell | first = Shannon | author-link = Shannon Bell | contribution = Writing the prostitute body: feminist reproductions | editor-last = Bell | editor-first = Shannon | editor-link = Shannon Bell | title = Reading, writing, and rewriting the prostitute body | pages = 79–80, 203 | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780253208590 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bpZRowUJfgUC&amp;pg=PA203 Preview.]&lt;br /&gt;

Dr Sprinkle identifies as a [[sex-positive feminist]], and much of her activist and sex education work reflects this philosophy. In 2009, she appeared in the French documentary film ''Mutantes: Punk, Porn, Feminism,'' speaking about the beginnings of the movement as well as her own contributions to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1576434/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm| title=Mutantes at IMDb| accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Dr Sprinkle and her wife/collaborator [[Beth Stephens]] were official artists in [[Documenta 14]], widely considered to be the most significant art exhibition in the world{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. They presented performances and visual art, lectured, and previewed their new film documentary, Water Makes Us Wet: An Ecosexual Adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/15/nature-ecosexual-annie-sprinkle-porn-star-queer|title=Nature is your lover, not your mother: meet ecosexual pioneer Annie Sprinkle|last=Theobald|first=Stephanie|date=2017-05-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGx-s9gj6rM|title=Video: "Ecosexual Walking Tour" of female porn activist Annie Sprinkle and Beth Stephens in Kassel during documenta 14.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nickname==
As noted above, Steinberg first gave herself the name '''“Annie”''' when she started working in pornography. As her career continued, she had an epiphany one night and she says that on that night," as if from the goddess herself," the name '''“Annie Sprinkle”''' came to her. She thought the name appropriate because "I was attracted by the sprinkles over ice cones (I am a bit of a sugaraholic!) and I love waterfalls, urine, vaginal fluids, sweat, anything wet. So the name 'Annie Sprinkle' seemed perfect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Annie Sprinkle |work=Miradas |language=Spanish |url=http://www.eictv.co.cu/miradas/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=531&amp;Itemid=93 |others=escrito por Redacción de Miradas |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501234022/http://www.eictv.co.cu/miradas/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=531&amp;Itemid=93 |archive-date=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|The Māori name for New Zealand.}}
[[File:National Library of New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand (49).JPG|thumb|A bilingual sign outside the [[National Library of New Zealand]] uses ''Aotearoa'' alongside New Zealand.]]

'''Aotearoa''' ({{IPA-mi|aɔˈtɛaɾɔa|lang}}; commonly pronounced by [[New Zealand English|English]] speakers as {{IPAc-en|audio=En-nz-Aotearoa.ogg|ˌ|aʊ|t|ɛəˈr|oʊ|.|ə}}) is the [[Māori language|Māori]] name for [[New Zealand]]. Its use is becoming widespread in the bilingual names of national organisations and institutions. The term was originally used by [[Māori people|Māori]] in reference to only the [[North Island]]. Since the 1990s, it has been customary to sing New Zealand's national anthem, "[[God Defend New Zealand]]", in both Māori and English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=God Defend New Zealand/Aotearoa {{!}} Ministry for Culture and Heritage|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/nz-identity-heritage/national-anthems/god-defend-new-zealandaotearoa|website=www.mch.govt.nz|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|accessdate=29 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; exposing the name to a wider audience.

The original meaning of ''Aotearoa'' is not known. The word can be broken up as: ''ao'' = cloud, dawn, daytime or world, ''tea'' = white, clear or bright and ''roa'' = long. It can also be broken up as ''Aotea'' = the name of one of the migratory [[waka (canoe)|waka]] that travelled to New Zealand, and ''roa'' = long. The common translation is "the land of the long white cloud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swirling cloud captured above New Zealand - 'The Land of the Long White Cloud'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/newzealand/4315307/Swirling-cloud-captured-above-New-Zealand-The-Land-of-the-Long-White-Cloud.html|accessdate=29 April 2017|work=Telegraph.co.uk|date=22 January 2009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative translations are ‘long bright world’ or ‘land of abiding day’ referring to the length and quality of the New Zealand daylight (when compared to the shorter days found further north in Polynesia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/light/1 |title=Light - Experiencing New Zealand light |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |editor=Jock Philips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some traditional stories, Aotearoa was the name of the canoe of the explorer [[Kupe]], and he named the land after it. Kupe's wife (in some versions, his daughter) was watching the horizon and called "He ao! He ao!" ("a cloud! a cloud!"). Other versions say the canoe was guided by a long white cloud in the course of the day and by a long bright cloud at night. On arrival, the sign of land to Kupe's crew was the long cloud hanging over it. The cloud caught Kupe's attention and he said "Surely is a point of land". Because of the cloud which greeted them, Kupe named the land Aotearoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Aotearoa|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of New Zealand (1966)]]|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/aotearoa|date=|editor=A.H.McLintock}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aotearoa can also be broken up as: ''aotea-roa''. ''Aotea'' is the name of one of the [[Māori migration canoes]]. The first land sighted was accordingly named ''Aotea'' (Cloud), now [[Great Barrier Island]]. When a much larger landmass was found beyond Aotea, it was called ''Aotea-roa'' (Long Aotea).{{refn|name=etymology|group=note|There are several other explanations of the origin of the word Aotearoa, of varying plausibility. Those that apply more to the South Island, relating to high snowy mountain ranges, or to the long Southern twilight, must be regarded with suspicion, given that Māori only used Aotearoa to refer to the North Island. One explanation derives the name from seafaring. The first sign of land from a boat is often cloud in the sky above the island.  The North Island's mountain ranges sometimes generate [[standing waves]] of long [[lenticular cloud]]s.  Another explanation relates to the mountains of the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau]]. In some years, the mountains are snow-capped for limited periods. The supposition here is that Polynesian travellers, unused to snow, might well have seen these snowy peaks as a long white cloud.  A third hypothesis surmises that [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] seafarers came from the tropics where night comes rapidly, with little twilight. New Zealand, in temperate latitudes, would have provided long periods of evening twilight, and also long summer days. Thus ''Aotearoa'', would then translate as "long light sky”.}}

== Usage ==
It is not known when Māori began incorporating the name into their [[oral tradition|lore]]. Beginning in 1845, [[George Grey]], [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor of New Zealand]], spent some years amassing information from Māori regarding their legends and histories. He translated it into English, and in 1855 published a book called ''Polynesian Mythology And Ancient Traditional History Of The New Zealand Race''. In a reference to [[Māui (Māori mythology)|Maui]], the [[culture hero]], Grey's translation of the Māori read as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus died this Maui we have spoken of; but before he died he had children, and sons were born to him; some of his descendants yet live in [[Hawaiki]], some in ''Aotearoa'' (or in these islands); the greater part of his descendants remained in Hawaiki, but a few of them came here to ''Aotearoa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''Aotearoa'' was used for the name of New Zealand in the 1878 translation of the national anthem, [[God Defend New Zealand]], by Judge Thomas H Smith of the Native Land Court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the translation still used today. Also, [[William Pember Reeves]] used ''Aotearoa'' to mean New Zealand in his history of the country published in 1898, ''The Long White Cloud Ao-tea-roa.{{refn|''The long White Cloud Ao-tea-roa'' can be viewed online at [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/12411 Project Gutenberg].|name=reeves|group=note}}''

In the 19th century, ''Aotearoa'' was sometimes used to refer only to the [[North Island]]. An example of this usage appeared in the first issue of ''Huia Tangata Kotahi'', a Māori-language newspaper published on February 8, 1893. It contained the dedication on the front page, ''"He perehi tenei mo nga iwi Maori, katoa, o Aotearoa, mete Waipounamu"'', meaning "This is a publication for the Māori tribes of Aotearoa and the South Island''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The widely used name for the North Island is ''Te Ika a Māui'', The fish of Māui. The South Island was called ''Te Wai Pounamu'', The Waters Of Greenstone, or ''Te Wāhi Pounamu'', The Place Of Greenstone.{{refn|name=southisland|group=note|As a counterpart to Te Ika a Māui, the South Island is sometimes referred to as ''Te Waka o Māui'', The Canoe of Māui, or ''Te Waka o Aoraki'', The Canoe of Aoraki, depending on one's tribal connections. Most of the South Island is settled by the descendants of Aoraki, after whom the country's [[Aoraki/Mount Cook|highest mountain]] is named (according to legend, he was turned into the mountain), but the northern end was settled by tribes who favour the Māui version.}} In early European maps of New Zealand, such as those of Captain [[James Cook]], garbled versions of these names are used to refer to the two islands (often spelt ''Aheinomauwe'' and ''Tovypoenammoo'').

[[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorer Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand in 1642 and named it ''Staten Land'' "in honour of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]]" (Dutch parliament).

After the adoption of the name ''New Zealand'' by Europeans, one name used by Māori to denote the country as a whole was ''Niu Tireni'',{{refn|name=spelling|group=note|The spelling varies, for example, the variant ''Nu Tirani'' appears in the Māori version of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].

'''Archaeo-optics''', or '''archaeological optics''', is the study of the experience and ritual use of light by ancient peoples. Archaeological [[optics]] is a branch of sensory archaeology, which explores human perceptions of the physical environment in the remote past, and is a sibling of [[archaeoastronomy]], which deals with ancient observations of celestial bodies, and archaeological acoustics, which deals with applications of sound.

Research by several investigators around the world has uncovered how ancient peoples encountered and used the [[camera obscura]] principle for a variety of purposes. In a darkened chamber, light passing through a small opening can create haunting and ephemeral moving images, which could have triggered and reinforced ground breaking modes of thought, forms of representation, and belief in otherworldly realms.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2009). “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura.” In Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Assimina Kaniari and Marina Wallace, eds.) London: Zidane. 153.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optical basis==

=== Light ===
Visible [[light]], a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, encompasses wavelengths between 380-750 nanometers, which humans perceive as the colors of the spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Light behaves according to a well-defined set of rules: it travels in straight lines, unless otherwise refracted or reflected by another object, or curved by gravity.

=== Vision ===
An [[eye]] is essentially a darkened chamber with a small hole in front that allows light to enter. The lens, just behind the pupil’s aperture, is perfectly clear but appears black because the interior space behind it is dark. Rays of light pass through the lens, producing an upside-down image on the retina.&lt;ref&gt;Explanation of camera obscura operations derived from Pollack, P. (1969). The Picture History of Photography: From the Earliest Beginnings to the Present Day. New York: Harry N. Abrams. 18.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The brain reorients the image. This optical process of projecting an inverted image is known as a [[camera obscura]] (from the Latin, meaning dark room). The first pinhole/camera obscura eyes evolved about 540 million years ago on a sea mollusk, known as a [[Nautilus#Senses|nautilus]], during the Cambrian period. The camera obscura principle is primordial, and life on earth has evolved to take advantage of it.

=== Camera obscura ===
The camera obscura principle is not limited to eyes, or even lenses, but works with a small hole, or aperture, and any darkened space of whatever size or shape. In modern times, camera obscuras have been fashioned from shoeboxes, oatmeal boxes, soda cans, cookie containers, seashells, eggshells, refrigerators, tents, trucks, airplane hangars, and even hollowed out forms of snow and dirt. A camera obscura can also be produced by a small hole in a roof, wall, or window-shutter through which the view of the outside is projected onto a wall inside a darkened room.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, H. and Gernsheim, A. (1969). The History of Photography: From the Camera Obscura to the Beginning of the Modern Era. New York: McGraw-Hill. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Biologist Donald Perry went on an expedition into the rain forest of Costa Rica where he climbed into the cavity of a large hollow tree, and discovered a small hole that projected an upside-down image of the outside world onto the opposite interior wall of the trunk.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, D. (1988). Life above the Jungle Floor. New York: Simon and Schuster. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  This sort of experience is available across time.&lt;ref&gt;Renner, E. (2004). Pinhole Photography: Rediscovering a Historic Technique (3rd ed). Oxford: Focal Press. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The image created appears like an upside-down movie. A camera obscura relies on the contrast between the bright exterior world and a dim interior space, so that a greater contrast produces a more obvious projected image. Absolute darkness in the interior is not necessary, but there must be a significant difference between the two illumination levels.

==Archaeological basis==

=== Architecture ===
The archaeological record is replete with excavations of built structures across time, but due to the natural decay of materials and the vagaries of preservation, the further backward in time, the less likely it is for artifacts to have survived. For example, [[Paleolithic]] shelter constructions from the Lower Paleolithic (c. 2,600,000 - 300,000 BP) and Middle Paleolithic (c. 300,000 - 45,000 BP) are generally less complete and thus subject to interpretation, while those dating to the Upper Paleolithic (c. 45,000- 10,000 BP) are both more numerous and better preserved. Paleolithic structures generally have no remaining superstructure, and must be inferred from a footprint of artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;For a good overview of Palaeolithic dwellings structures and strategies see Cattelain, P. and Hauzeur, A. (1998). “Des premiers abris aux premières maisons.” In Les grandes inventions de la Préhistoire (Bellier C. and Cattelain, P. eds.) (Guides archéologiques du Malgré-Tout) Treignes: CEDARC. 37-46; and De Beaune, S. (2012). “Aux origins de la construction.” In Édifice et Artifice (R. Carvais, A. Guillerme, V. Nègre, J. Sakarovitch, eds.) Premier Congrès francophone d’histoire de la construction Paris, 2008  Paris: Piccard. 77-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, some [[Neolithic]] structures retain above ground elements. The Neolithic saw the rise of agriculture and the establishment of settlements, which produced a surplus of foodstuffs and an increase in population density. A large, coordinated labor force enabled the process of hauling enormous stones to build large, permanent structures. By about 5000 BP, many groups of people over a widespread area were erecting large timbers and stones, or megaliths, to enclose communal spaces. Into historical times, the development of writing offered another layer of information, with descriptions of the physical appearance, materials, design, use, and events related to structures. This combination of remnants and records enhances the accuracy of archaeo-optical analysis.

=== Archaeological optics and archaeoastronomy ===
There is some evidence that prehistorical structures oriented upon the sun's position on the horizon also created camera obscura situations. Examples in Western Europe include midwinter sunrise at [[Newgrange]],&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange. Archaeology, Art and Legend. London, Thames and Hudson. 117, 123-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  midwinter sunset at [[Maeshowe]],&lt;ref&gt;MacKie, E.W. (1997). “Maeshowe and the Winter Solstice: ceremonial aspects of the Orkney Grooved Ware culture.” Antiquity 71. 338-59.&lt;/ref&gt;  and midsummer sunrise at [[Bryn Celli Ddu]].&lt;ref&gt;Burrow, S. (2010). “Bryn Celli Ddu Passage Tomb, Anglesey: Alignment, Construction, Date and Ritual.” In Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 76. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

While archaeoastronomical studies have traditionally discussed these kinds of monument as observatories, fieldwork conducted in the 1990s at [[Clava cairn|Balnuaran]] of Clava by Ronnie Scott and Tim Phillips suggests the midwinter sunset would have cast images inside two [[Passage Tombs|passage tombs]]. By temporarily reconstructing the collapsed roofs of these monuments, they noted that the act of viewing the sun along their passageways was not only potentially blinding but could only be clearly viewed by one person at a time. In contrast, an audience of over twenty people could stand with their backs to the opening to observe the effects of sunlight falling upon deliberately patterned stonework built into walls of both chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1999). “Clava: Light at the End of the Tunnel.” Current Archaeology 165. 332-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  These observations inspired Scott to speculate that these structures were camera obscuras, and that an optical projection of the sun’s disc would reproduce the movements of the sun through the sky for many people to see at once.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1998). “Archaeological experiment at Balnuaran of Clava North Eastern cairn on 20th and 22nd December 1997.” In Sites and Monuments Archive: &lt;http://her.highland.gov.uk/hbsmrgatewayhighland/DataFiles/LibraryLinkFiles/37677.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeological optics and the archaeology of the senses ===
Archaeological optics contributes to a wider discipline, the archaeology of the senses. Rather than just recording the remains of the past such as standing stones or built walls, this wider discipline emphasizes how the spaces in-between these features could have been arenas for sensory experiences, even if parts of the original structures have disappeared. Among the senses, vision has been a major consideration, including studies of visibility between sites,&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, A.B.  and Woodwood, P.J. (1996). “The topography of some barrow cemeteries in Bronze Age Wessex.” In Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 62. 275-91.&lt;/ref&gt;  interactions with geology and topography,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, R. (1998). Ruined buildings, ruined stones: enclosures, tombs and natural places in the Neolithic of south-west England.

(2002). “Experiencing texture and transformation in the British Neolithic.”In Oxford Journal of Archaeology 21(3). 249-61.&lt;/ref&gt;  can also be considered.

Other studies have examined archaeomusicology and archaeoacoustics.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, C and Lawson, G., eds. (2006). Archaeoacoustics. Cambridge: McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.&lt;/ref&gt;  Palaeolithic bone artifacts have been interpreted as musical instruments,&lt;ref&gt;Megaw, J.V.S.

(1981). “The archaeomusicology of Scandinavia.” In World Archaeology 12. 246-65.&lt;/ref&gt;  while some natural features within caves have been found to emit unusual sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Dams, L. (1984). “Preliminary findings at the ‘Organ’ Sanctuary in the cave of Nerja, Malaga, Spain.” In Oxford Journal of Archaeology 3. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  There have also been suggestions that Paleolithic cave art clusters in locations where caverns have especially resonant properties.&lt;ref&gt;Reznikoff, I. and Dauvois, M. (1988). “La dimension sonore des grottes ornées.” In Bulletin de la Société Préhistorique Française 85. 238-46.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s the sonic properties of built architecture came under increasing scrutiny with investigations into vocally induced resonances inside chambered Neolithic sites,&lt;ref&gt;Devereux, P. and Jahn, R (1996). “Preliminary investigations and cognitive considerations of the acoustical resonances of selected archaeological sites.” In Antiquity 70. 665-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as the wider acoustic phenomenon within a variety of megalithic structures.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Keating. D. (1999). “Architecture and sound: an acoustic analysis of megalithic monuments in prehistoric Britain.” In Antiquity 73. 325-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

An archaeology of the senses, including archaeological optics, emphasizes that the past was inhabited by living people whose experiences were inherently partial and subjective. Indeed, this subjectivity might have lent both meaning and mystery to events occurring within ancient structures. This acknowledges that the senses were likely to have been used and understood in very different ways by people through time.

==Development of the field of archaeological optics==

The study of ancient perceptions of light developed from many disparate sources — archaeologists, artists, antiquarians, and astronomers  — with precursors reaching back at least a millennium. In 1998, archaeologist Ronnie Scott speculated that Neolithic [[Passage grave|passage tombs]] in Scotland might have been used as camera obscuras.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1998). “Archaeological experiment at Balnuaran of Clava North Eastern cairn on 20th and 22nd December 1997.” In Sites and Monuments Archive: &lt;http://her.highland.gov.uk/hbsmrgatewayhighland/DataFiles/LibraryLinkFiles/37677.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, Robert Temple published an investigation into [[Nimrud lens|crystal lenses]] that date to antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Temple, R. (2000). The Crystal Sun: The Most Secret Science of the Ancient World. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeo-optics, as yet unnamed, arose as a formal line of inquiry beginning in 2005, with a presentation by Matt Gatton and his colleagues of “The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art” at the University of Louisville, Kentucky. They made subsequent presentations at the University of Lisbon in 2006, and Archaeology Institute at Oxford University in 2007. A small number of researchers independently began to undertake archaeological optics fieldwork at Neolithic passage tombs. In 2011, Morgan Saletta published a paper noting camera obscura projections at two sites in the south of France.&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M. (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 364-73.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2011, Gatton began documenting optical projections at sites in Denmark. Aaron Watson, in collaboration with Ronnie Scott, began to record the archaeo-optic properties of monuments in Scotland in 2012, and Wales in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In Papadopoulos. C. and Moyes, H., eds., The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, the concept of archaeological optics as a broader academic field has coalesced with Constantinos Papadopoulos and Holley Moyes’s planning of the Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology, which brought researchers working along similar lines into contact.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In Papadopoulos.

==Palaeolithic archaeological optics==

=== Paleolithic structures ===
The Lower Paleolithic was a time of early humans such as [[Homo habilis]] and [[Homo erectus]]. Possible indications of the early development of shelter construction during the Lower Paleolithic come from excavations at [[Olduvai Gorge]],&lt;ref&gt;Leakey, M.D. (1971).

====Taphonomy====

The actual physical evidence of Paleolithic shelters is limited to permanent materials like stone and bone. No wooden post or animal hide has been found, because these materials disintegrate over the course of time. But the existence of the perishable elements can be established. Postholes prove the existence of the wooden supports. The alignment of the holes or a circle of support stones describes a footprint of a framework. The area covered by flint scattered from blade work, and other household activities, further demarcates the interior shape of the structure.

The types of stones, bones, and minerals found at the campsites further describe the use of animal hides as tent covering. Butchered and burned animal bones found around the fire pit show which types of animals were hunted and eaten. Stone tools such as hide scrapers and deposits of minerals employed in preparing skins show the routine use of animal hides. In addition, there are a host of ethnographic parallels, as indigenous cultures throughout the world relied on animal hides as a shelter covering material until the onset of the modern era.

====Lifeways====
The people of the Paleolithic existed prior to agriculture and the domestication of animals, and they would have lived as small bands of [[hunter-gatherers]], moving from place to place, exploiting plant, animal, and mineral resources. Two of the factors that influenced choice of location were proximity to fresh water and animal migration routes.&lt;ref&gt;Bahn, P.G. (1985). Pyrenean Prehistory: A Palaeoeconomic Survey of the French Sites. Warminster: Aris &amp; Phillips. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;  Paleolithic foragers would also set up camp overlooking fields inhabited by herds of hoofed herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, D. (1987). The Field Guide to Early Man. New York: Diagram Group. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleolithic campsites were characterized by repeated, seasonal, short-term occupation. While the inhabitants were quite mobile, without beasts of burden, shelters were not transported. A tent might stand at its location for a few years before it deteriorated and had to be rebuilt. The archaeological record describes shelters rebuilt over-and-over on roughly the same spot. Bands of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers followed an annual circuit with shelters built at strategic points along the way.

====Hearths====
Paleolithic campsites were dotted with external fire pits and internal hearths. The internal hearths were not open-burning fires, but were hollow areas that held heated stones and charcoal.&lt;ref&gt;Leesch, D. and Bullinger, J. (2012). “Identifying dwellings in Upper Palaeolithic open-air sites: The Magdalenian site at Monruz (Switzerland) and its contribution to analysing palimpsest.” In A Mind Set on Flint: Studies in Honour of Dick Stapert (Niekus, M., Barton, N., Street, M., Terberger, T., eds.)

Hot stones and charcoals would be rolled, with sticks or bones, onto a thick animal hide and conveyed a couple of meters from the fire pit to the hearth. The next day the task would be repeated: hearths were taken apart and reassembled routinely. Frequent heating caused the rocks to discolor and crumble. Once a rock was no longer effective at holding heat, it was thrown in a nearby refuse pit along with animal bones and other household waste. An internal stone hearth is an effective strategy for staying warm, but it did not provide any light.&lt;ref&gt;Leesch, D., and Bullinger, J.

Groningen Archaeological Studies, Vol. 16. Groningen: Barkhuis. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;  The interiors of the tents were then dim places, where ancient people would have witnessed the camera obscura effect.

=== Paleolithic archaeological optics ===
Paleolithic archaeological optics involves investigations into the image projection capacities of Paleolithic tent reconstructions.

====Reconstructions====
The suitability of Paleolithic tents/shelters for coincidental camera obscura formation was explored during a set of experiments under the direction of Matt Gatton in 2005 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2005). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The case for image projection in the Palaeolithic, first presented at the University of Louisville.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; October 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first set of experiments took place on a bison ranch in Oldham County, Kentucky, where a small, rudimentary bison hide [[teepee]] was erected next to a pasture, and images of the bison were cast through a hole in the hides and projected into the tent. The second set of experiments occurred at a rock shelter outside of Irvine, Estill County, Kentucky, where the investigators leaned a framework of tree branches against a rock wall and covered it with bison hides. The image of a horse outside was projected through a rough hole in the hides and into the interior space. The third set of experiments took place at the Musée du Malgré-Tout in Belgium, where archaeologists Pierre Cattelain and Claire Bellier reconstructed a variety of Paleolithic structures in several places in France, Germany and Ukraine. A smattering of holes was present in the hide coverings of each tent. At the German site, images were projected inside the reconstruction onto a rabbit hide.

====Statistical analysis====
The tent reconstructions established some plausibility of accidental camera obscura formation during the Paleolithic, but plausibility is not probability, so the question of the probable frequency of projected images was explored by [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] statistical modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2011). “Probability and the Origin of Art: Simulations of the Paleo-camera Theory.” In APLIMAT, Journal of Applied Mathematics, Volume 4. 181-190 Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2012). “Projecting Projection: A statistical analysis of cast-light images.” In Pleistocene Coalition Newsletter #18.&lt;/ref&gt;

To evaluate the probability of an unknown event a series of conditional probabilities were used to create a chance tree using [https://www.treeage.com/products/ TreeAge Pro 2011] (Williamstown, MA). The conditions affecting the appearance of projected images are the general context of the shelter, aperture existence, aperture size, sunlight exposure, weather, occupancy, and the specific context of the dwelling. Given the different situations regarding variables; the probability of a person observing a projected image inside a Palaeolithic dwelling ranged from 1% to 8% per day, or 4 to 29 times per year.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2011). “Probability and the Origin of Art: Simulations of the Paleo-camera Theory.” In APLIMAT, Journal of Applied Mathematics, Volume 4. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiplying the yearly occurrences by the range of years and the estimated human population; camera obscura images could have been observed anywhere from 54.8 billion to 4.38 trillion times (5.48x10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; to 4.38x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) over the course of prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. and Carreon, L. (2011). “Probability and the Origin of Art: Simulations of the Paleo-camera Theory.” In APLIMAT, Journal of Applied Mathematics, Volume 4. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implications ===
The likely prevalence of prehistoric camera obscuras throughout the human experience suggests several important implications for the development of art, religious beliefs, philosophy and existing cave art.

====Art====
The origins of art have been a significant mystery, because art, as a form of communication, is largely a social construct. The core issue is that there can be no intention to represent an object or scene without first knowing that such a depiction is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, I. and Noble, W.

(2002). Mind in the Cave. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2002. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  The archaeo-optical explanation is that images projected inside a dwelling space provided, according to Cambridge professor Nigel Spivey, “… a prototypical visual experience that triggers the concept of representation…”&lt;ref&gt;Personal correspondence, E-mail from Nigel Spivey to Matt Gatton sent on Monday, March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the images would be shared experiences, visible by everyone in the tent or structure at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M., Carreon, L., Cawein, M., Brock, W., and Scott, V. (2010). “The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The case for image projection in the Palaeolithic.” In the Official Proceedings of the XV World Congress of the Union Internationale des Sciences Préhistoriques et Protohistoriques (UISPP) 35, Lisbon 2006, Global State of the Art--SO7 (Kumar, G. and Bednarik, R., eds.) Oxford: Archaeopress. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;  The group could thus collectively experience, discuss, verify, confirm, investigate, and interpret the images projected on the surfaces before them. It is the communal aspect of the images that makes the development of visual art socially feasible.

“A randomly projected image stands for a real object; it says bison without being a flesh and blood bison, planting the idea of a referent, the conceptual beginning of art.” -Matt Gatton&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura” in Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Kaniari, A. and Wallace, M., eds.) London: Zidane. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Faith====
It is also possible that camera obscura images could have fostered religious belief. A broad definition of religion is a belief in an alternative realm that influences physical reality. Theologian Rudolf Otto held that the origins of religion are to be found in the concept of the sacred, the divine presenting itself as something “wholly other” (ganz andere).&lt;ref&gt;Otto, R. (1950 ed.). The idea of the holy; an inquiry into the non-rational factor in the idea of the divine and its relation to the rational [Harvey, J.W., trans.]. New York: Oxford University Press, 1950 ed. Originally published in German as Das Heilige (1917).&lt;/ref&gt;  The images projected in Paleolithic tents would have offered an early gateway to the concept of an alternative realm, a glimpse of an "other", that initiated a belief in something that was not seen moment to moment. The images, once seen, lingered in the mind, and took root in the culture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The camera’s image instantly splits a quasi-reality away from reality, peeling off an ‘other’ from the ‘is’; instilling the very idea that animals, plants, and humans have existences in other forms, spirits, on other planes.” - Matt Gatton&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Paleo-camera and the Concept of Representation." In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 3 (Feliks, J., ed.) May–June. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once the concept of an alternative realm had taken root, it would have provided a domain for agents of an "other" world to intervene in human affairs. The notion of spirit forms is the very root of animism, the oldest known, and perhaps first, form of religion. The incidental image is possibly the first glimpse of the "divine".&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Paleo-camera and the Concept of Representation." In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 3 (Feliks, J., ed.) May–June. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophy====

The core issue of metaphysics is the investigation of the nature of reality. The images in a Paleolithic tent would trigger a cascade of thoughts about the essence of reality: What is ''that'' plane of existence? And reflexively, what is ''this'' plane?&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2009). “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura.” In Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Kaniari, A. and Wallace, M., eds.) London: Zidane. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;  Only by glimpsing an alternative reality does this reality become open to question — the very start of abstract examination.

====Schematicized distortions====
The projections by camera obscura can also explain some common features among cave paintings of animals and people. Paleolithic [[Cave painting|cave art]] is well known for iconic, schematicized figures, usually with extremely small heads and enormous, often bowed, bodies. Examples of the core elements of some Paleolithic cultures’ visual lexicon — repetition, disconnection, movement, superimposition, and distortion — are expressed in engravings on flat stones and bones within the habitation sites and also on the walls of deep caves.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “The Camera and the Cave: Understanding the style of Palaeolithic art.” In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 5 (Feliks, J., ed.) September–October.
Gatton, M. (2010). “Paleo-camera, Phase II: Projected images in art and ritual (or why European Upper Palaeolithic art looks the way it does).” In Pleistocene Coalition News, Vol. 2: Issue 4 (Feliks, J., ed.) July–August.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, Matt Gatton, Walter Brock, and Dylan Brock set up a room-sized camera obscura on a farm in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. The image of a horse was projected on to a small flat stone. It was natural for the artist to catch the image with his torso, the engraving stone secured against the body, and the eyes looking down on the inverted image. In this scenario it was advantageous to tilt the stone slightly. The more the stone was tilted the more the image of the animal distorted, the animal’s head reducing in size and the stomach bowing downward, quite like the distortions seen in some deep cave art.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2009). “First Light: Inside the Palaeolithic camera obscura.” In Acts of Seeing: Artists, Scientists and the History of the Visual -- a volume dedicated to Martin Kemp (Kaniari, A. and Wallace, M., eds.) London: Zidane. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  This distortion is known as the [[keystone effect]]. Gatton proposed that the deep cave distortions may have resulted from the camera obscura effects within the tents.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2005). “Drawing experiments” in “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The case for image projection in the Palaeolithic, first presented at the University of Louisville.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paleolithic archaeo-optic concepts in wider culture ===

The hypothesis that paleolithic people would have seen camera obscura effects within their shelters—Gatton’s Paleolithic Camera Obscura Theory—has gained wider exposure in the last several years, including specific references in the following venues.

==Neolithic archaeological optics==
The [[Neolithic]] period offers the possibility to explore optical image projections within built architecture. Neolithic structures range from modest houses to enormous enclosures and mounds, and were constructed using combinations of earth, timber and stone. Archaeo-optic fieldwork has focused upon [[megalithic]] monuments.

=== Megalithic structures ===
Megaliths, or large stones, come in two main types of architectural presentations: freestanding and earth-covered. Individual and groupings of standing stones  — in formations of circles, lines, ovals, ‘U’-shapes, or rectangles — were not employed to support the weight of soil above them, but served as markers. Megalithic chambers designed to bear the weight of a mound of earth, turf, rubble or stone have been classified into groups, including [[dolmen]]s, portal dolmens, [[gallery grave]]s, [[Wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tombs]], [[passage tomb]]s, and [[Court cairn|court tombs]]. The term "dolmen" describes groupings of erected stones supporting one large, flat roof stone, like an oversized rudimentary table. "Portal dolmens" have an angled stone slab supported by uprights that define a chamber, often with an entrance. "Gallery" graves are elongated dolmens consisting of two rows of upright stones (orthostats) supporting a series of flat roof stones (lintels). "Wedge" tombs are wider at the mouth, and narrower as they recede inward. "Passage tombs" have a long boulder-built passage that leads to a buried chamber. "Court" tombs are so-named because they have what appears to be a courtyard encircled by standing stones in front of the tomb chamber. Although many of these structures now appear as freestanding monuments, their stones were often the skeletal substructures of mounds removed by erosion or human action.

A major focus for megalithic chambers is in western Europe: Scandinavia, the British Isles, France, and Iberia. Their origin, chronology and purpose is a subject of ongoing research and debate. In fact, they are not limited to Europe, and are found across Eurasia and the entire globe. Their significance in past cultures is suggested by the labor and resources required to create them. The painstakingly and intricately constructed mounds were significant feats, requiring tens of thousands of hours to construct. For example, it has been speculated that a workforce of 400 working continuously for two months every year would have taken around 16 years to construct the 200,000 tonne cairn at Newgrange.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange. Archaeology, Art and Legend. London: Thames and Hudson. 117-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the British Isles and Ireland it is possible that many different kinds of chambered monument, including those constructed from timber, may have been suited to the creation of optical phenomenon. Recent studies have focused upon one format in particular: the megalithic passage tomb.

====Passage tombs====
Passage tombs comprise a single stone-built passageway that gives access to a central chamber, and there may be adjoining chambers or cells. This structure is entirely covered by a mound that might consist of earth, rubble, turf or clay. Their distribution extends across the west of Europe. Determining the exact numbers of these sites is problematic due to the poor preservation of many. There are over one hundred and fifty proven passage tombs in Ireland, with an overall estimate of over three hundred in total,&lt;ref&gt;Eogan, G. (1986). Knowth and the passage tombs of Ireland. London: Thames and Hudson. 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  roughly five hundred in Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;Nualláin, S.Ó. (1979). “The Megalithic Tombs of Ireland” in Expedition 21, no. 3, University of Pennsylvania. 11. See also Møder med Danmarks oldtid (2011) (exhibition). National Museet, Copenhagen.&lt;/ref&gt;  and over 250 in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, A.S. and Ritchie, J.N.G. (2001). The Chambered Cairns of the Central Highlands. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their classification has been further divided into groups such as the Orkney-Cromarty, Maeshowe and Clava traditions, but all retain the same fundamental format. Their construction likely began in the earlier Neolithic soon after 5600 BP&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1991). The Chambered Cairns of Caithness. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 83-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  and extends to around 4000 BP at excavated examples of Clava Cairn passage tombs,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, R. (2000). The Good Stones: A new investigation of the Clava Cairns. Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Monograph 17. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  but this need not imply that they were constructed or used throughout this time.

====Passage tomb Preservation====
The survival of passage tombs is variable and dependent upon many factors. The excavation of two later Neolithic passage graves at Balnuaran of Clava demonstrated that their architecture was inherently unstable and would have likely collapsed within decades of their construction.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley. R. (1998). “Architecture, Imagination and the Neolithic world.” In Creativity in Human Evolution and Prehistory, (Mithen, S., ed.). London: Routledge. 227-240.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier examples, including the Orkney-Cromarty format, appear to generally have been more robust. Passage tombs could also be reused in later times, including the Iron Age and early Medieval, and their Neolithic content was sometimes removed. Some were destroyed when new structures were built upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Hingley, R. (1996). “Ancestors and identity in the later prehistory of Atlantic Scotland: the reuse and reinvention of Neolithic monuments and material culture.” In World Archaeology 28. 231-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most have required consolidation, reconstruction or strengthening to allow public access. In the Boyne Valley, Newgrange and Knowth have undergone significant excavation and restoration.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange. Archaeology, Art and Legend. London, Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eogan, G. (1986). Knowth and the passage tombs of Ireland. London: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;   In Orkney, the roof of the chamber within Maeshowe has been restored following damage caused by Vikings in the twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 62-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, recent building work has significantly altered their appearance, a critical factor that has to be taken into account when observing and interpreting optical phenomena within their passages and chambers.

====Conundrum of use====
Passage tombs across Europe have long been a focus for myths and legends. Medieval lore has it that wizards, giants, witches, or demons erected the great stones, and that the mounds were the homes of gnomes, elves, faeries, and goblins.&lt;ref&gt;Burl, A. (1999). Circles of Stone: The Prehistoric Rings of Britain and Ireland. London: Harvill Press. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Denmark, passage graves are still referred to as jættestuer (troll houses). An analysis of Irish folk tales revealed that megalithic mounds both served as the burial places of ancient heroes, and were the abodes of supernatural beings.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange: Archaeology, art and legend. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many passage tombs do indeed contain the remains of the dead—sometimes in significant quantities. For example, excavations at [[Chambered cairn#Maeshowe|Quanterness]] revealed the bones of 157 individuals of various ages, but the total number held within the tomb may have been nearer to 400.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal remains and artifacts are also found at some sites, including beads, stone balls and pottery.

It appears that burial was not the sole function of passage "tombs". Some sites contain little evidence of human remains, although this could reflect their subsequent histories, while others have evidence for activities by the living. Fires were burnt within sites in Orkney&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  and at Knowth, Dowth and Newgrange in Ireland there are examples where images were carved in situ upon stones within their interiors.&lt;ref&gt;Eogan, G. (1986). Knowth and the passage tombs of Ireland. London: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A. (2004). “By Way of Illustration: Art, Memory and Materiality in the Irish Sea and Beyond.” In The Neolithic of the Irish Sea: Materiality and Traditions of Practice, (Cummings, V. and Fowler, C., eds.) Oxford: Oxbow. 202-13.&lt;/ref&gt;    The passages at a number of sites align with sunrise or sunset at pivotal times of the year causing their otherwise darkened chambers to be illuminated. Many demonstrate extraordinary acoustic properties. Together, these factors suggest that passage tombs might be interpreted as venues for diverse activities that involved both the living and the dead.

=== The use of passage tombs as camera obscuras ===
The principal fieldwork exploring the optical properties of passage tombs has been conducted by Matt Gatton in Denmark, Morgan Saletta in France, Aaron Watson in Wales, Aaron Watson and Ronnie Scott in Scotland, and Eva Bosch in Spain.

====Format====
The format of passage tombs is uniquely suited to the creation and control of optical projections. These structures reproduce the fundamental format of a camera obscura&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of Life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  and fieldwork has demonstrated that they can indeed have remarkable projection capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H. eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The chamber offers a dark space while the single passageway enables the movement of light to be closely controlled. In some cases their basic configuration alone is sufficient to cast a projection,&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M. (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 370-1.&lt;/ref&gt;  and a small number offer mechanisms through which light can be closely controlled. For example, the roof-box at Newgrange has evidence for the repeated relocation of quartz blocks that could have been used to manipulate optical projections.&lt;ref&gt;O’Kelly, M. (1982). Newgrange: Archaeology, art and legend. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the majority of cases, however, additional apertures were required.

====Restricted access====
The entrances at many passage tombs appear to have been temporarily sealed in a variety of ways: boulders, slabs, blocks, planks or wooden frameworks, as evidenced by postholes by the entrance. Maeshowe has a recess near to the passage entrance that holds a carefully balanced portal stone that can be pivoted into place.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.L. and Henshall, A.S. (1989). The Chambered Cairns of Orkney. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 51.
&lt;/ref&gt;  This leaves a narrow gap between the top of this block and the passage lintels, thereby allowing light to enter even when the passageway is impassable to people.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, C. (1999). Astronomy in Prehistoric Britain and Ireland. London: Yale University Press. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the roof box at Newgrange is situated above the passageway, as is a comparable feature within Cairn G at Carrowkeel. These apertures could be operated independently to the passages. Even in the absence of such devices only minor additions - stone blocks, a hole in a wooden plank, or an animal hide hung between posts at the entrance - are required to convert the monument into an operational camera obscura. The passage serves as a conduit for light and the rear of the chamber acts as a projection surface.

====Aperture plane====
The character of optical projections within passage tombs is determined by a number of interconnected factors. Lighting inside the monument needs to be low but total darkness is not always required, depending on the relative brightness outside.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Palaeo-camera and the Concept of Representation.” In Pleistocene Coalition News 2 (3). 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M., Carreon, L., Cawein, M., Brock, W. and Scott, V. (2010). “The Camera Obscura and the Origin of Art: The Case for Image Projection in the Palaeolithic.” In Proceedings of the XV World Congress of the Union Internationale des Sciences Préhistoriques et Protohistoriques (UISPP) 35, Global State of the Art (SO7), BAR S2108, (Kumar, G. and Bednarik, R., eds.) 135-41. Oxford: Archaeopress.&lt;/ref&gt;    Observations at the Grey Cairns of Camster by Aaron Watson and Ronnie Scott showed that it was possible to cast projections in fog, rain and under heavy cloud, but that such conditions significantly impaired their clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2016). “Archaeo-optics and image projection in the Neolithic.” In &lt;www.monumental.uk.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The size and brightness of projections can be adjusted both by modifying the size of the aperture and moving the aperture plane itself in relation to the focal plane, which is frequently the wall of the chamber aligned with the passageway. Increasing the focal distance by moving the aperture along the passage increases the size of the projection but also reduces its brightness. Reducing the aperture diameter results in a more focused, but increasingly dark, image. A further contributing factor is the texture of the surface upon which the image is projected. For example, observations by Aaron Watson have revealed that the slab that constitutes the back wall of the chamber at Bryn Celli Ddu is smooth enough to carry a detailed image.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2016). “Archaeo-optics and image projection in the Neolithic.” In &lt;www.monumental.uk.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, projections inside Cuween Hill fall upon rough stone walling, requiring the distance between the aperture and focal plane to be increased, thereby enlarging the image in order to render it visible.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H. eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of images projected within Neolithic passage tombs ===

====Images of the sun====
When aligned upon the sun, a properly configured passage tomb is capable of casting an enlarged image of the solar disc. As long as the aperture remains static this projected solar disc will move along the wall as the sun moves across the sky. During sunrise, for example, the sun’s image will appear to travel across the chamber and then out along the walls of the passageway. Gatton has suggested that images carved upon the chamber walls of Cairn T at Loughcrew may reproduce these movements of the sun’s disc.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, archaeologist Morgan Saletta reported solar projections within the sites of Grotte de Bounias and Grotte de la Source during equinoctial sunsets. These were a result of the architectural format of these monuments creating sufficiently restricted apertures to cast a distinct, though unfocused, projection.&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M.  (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 370-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of midsummer sunrise in 2014 and 2015, Aaron Watson documented solar projections within Bryn Celli Ddu. By locating the aperture close to the chamber it was possible to cast a distinct image of nearby trees and the rising sun, together framed by the outline of the passage. In contrast, relocating the aperture to the passage entrance significantly enlarged the sun’s disc to a diameter of 10&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Images of aligned monuments====
If a passage tomb is aligned upon another monument, the camera obscura method can be used to project recognisable images of that monument into the chamber. For example, while the setting sun shines directly into Maeshowe’s chamber when the sun is at its southwestern extreme (winter solstice sunset), there is also a reverse alignment (summer solstice sunrise) when the sun is at its northeastern extreme. This will illuminate the distant Barnhouse Stone such that its image could be projected inside Maeshowe’s chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Balnuaran of Clava, two neighbouring passage tombs share a south-westerly axis in order that their passageways open towards the midwinter sunset.&lt;ref&gt;See Bradley, R. (2000). The Good Stones: A New Investigation of the Clava Cairns. Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Monograph 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only does the cairn to the south-west appear centrally framed when looking down the passage from that to the north-east, but fieldwork by Ronnie Scott and Tim Phillips has documented how the midwinter setting sun appears to descend directly into the apex of its roof.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, R. and Phillips, T. (1999). “Clava: Light at the End of the Tunnel.” In Current Archaeology 165. 332-335.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Images of the landscape====
Many passage tombs are set in elevated situations with extensive views, or even focused upon distinctive topographic features. These would therefore appear within optical projections inside their chambers. Aaron Watson has documented optical projections inside Cuween Hill, Orkney, that feature expansive views across the Bay of Firth. Inside the Dwarfie Stane, also in Orkney, it is possible to cast a panoramic image of the uplands of Hoy.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the majority of passage tombs may have lost their lintels and roofs it is possible to consider the views that may originally have been projected into their chambers. For example, the ruinous site of Badnabay, north-west Scotland, appears to be aligned upon a mountain with a distinctive profile.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2016). “Archaeo-optics and image projection in the Neolithic.” In &lt;www.monumental.uk.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Images of people====
Reflected sunlight can illuminate people located within passage tomb forecourts, creating what Gatton has described as "spirit" projections due to their ephemeral, spectral qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Camera Obscura and the Megalithic Tomb: The role of projected solar images in the symbolic renewal of Life.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  When backlit these figures appear as dark silhouettes, but at those times when the sun is behind the monument, and the forecourt area brightly lit, they are enhanced in color and detail. Aaron Watson has photographed optical projections of people inside Cuween Hill, Wideford Hill, Vinquoy Hill, the Dwarfie Stane and the Grey Cairns of Camster.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Camera obscura projections are animated in a manner akin to cinematography and, while projected human figures appear upside down and back to front, they move in real time. This creates distinctive illusions where individuals, or even groups of people, can appear to emerge from the chamber wall. As the angles between the external subject and the aperture become increasingly oblique, projections can also be cast upon the floor, walls and ceiling of a monument. This can create the illusion of a human shadow moving through the passage tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immersive multisensory experiences within passage tombs ===
Passage tomb architecture spatially constrains the number of people who can simultaneously occupy their chambers, effectively restricting access to specialist kinds of knowledge&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J. (1992). “Monuments, Movement and the Context of Megalithic Art.” In Vessels for the Ancestors, (Sharples, N. and Sheridan, A., Eds.) Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 62-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  and unusual combinations of sensory experience. Whether these sites embody astronomical orientations, occupy special places in the landscape, or acted as the receptacles for ancestral remains, the camera obscura theory expands the significance and meaning of light entering these monuments.

Inverted images of the outside world, viewed by people located in the depths of a megalithic cairn, would very effectively generate a sense of "otherness".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. and Scott, R. (2016). “Materialising Light, Making Worlds: Optical Image Projection within the Megalithic Passage Tombs of Britain and Ireland.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.) Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, people in the Neolithic did not share present-day knowledge of optical physics, and would have had their own understandings. Even from a scientific perspective, however, the act of witnessing the projection of the sun’s disc, or human figures emerging from a stone wall, is rather suggestive of an encounter with the supernatural. It has been suggested that projections of the sun may have been interpreted as the manifestation of a Neolithic solar deity.&lt;ref&gt;Saletta, M. (2011). “The Archaeoastronomy of the Megalithic Monuments of Arles-Fontvieille: The Equinox, the Pleiades and Orion.” In Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union 7. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, optical projections converge with other sensory qualities of these places, potentially including the presence of the remains of the dead, rock art, and dynamic archaeo-acoustic sound effects. There is also a possibility that these kinds of experiences were combined and choreographed in order to maximize their theatrical impact upon an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. (2001). “The Sounds of Transformation: Acoustics, Monuments and Ritual in the British Neolithic.” In The Archaeology of Shamanism, (Price, N., ed.) London: Routledge. 178-92.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than silent places of the death, passage tombs may have acted as places where people could engage with powerful multi-sensory experiences that transported their occupants to other dimensions, or brought them into the presence of forces that are difficult to imagine in the present day.

==Ancient Egyptian funerary monuments==
The Ancient Egyptians may have also witnessed—and recorded—camera obscura effects. Ancient Egyptian texts, known collectively as the [[Enigmatic Book of the Netherworld|Books of the Netherworld]], describe pharaonic funerary complexes as sun-powered resurrection machines that somehow affected a merger of the pharaoh's soul with the sun god.&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, M. (1997). The Complete Pyramids: Solving the Ancient Mysteries. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. 20. For an explanation of how the sun sets off the resurrection process see page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The continuation of the entire cosmos was dependent upon the sun god who was regenerated in darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Hornung, E. (1999). Akhenaten and the Religion of Light [David Lorton, trans.] Ithaca: Cornell University Press. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptian concept of the pharaonic soul was complicated and divided into several aspects. The [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#Ka .28vital spark.29|''ka'' aspect]] was a spirit double, created at birth, with the physical appearance of the person. After death, the ''ka'' would leave the body and travel through the underworld at night and return to its physical representation (the mummy, statue, or artworks) each morning. [[Pharaoh|Pharaonic]] mortuary temples, which faced east toward the dawn sun and were affixed to the side of [[pyramid]]s during the pyramid building era, featured a darkened inner sanctuary with a ''ka'' statue of the pharaoh. When the sun rose on the horizon, its rays would travel down the central passageway of the temple, and project the image of the sun onto the ''ka'' and, conversely, reflect the ''ka'' back to the sun, uniting the two.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Light of Amen-Ra: The key role of projected images in the Pharaoh’s ritual renewal.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the conceptual leap that underpins Ancient Egyptian culture — the pharaoh’s soul road on a beam of light.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2010). “Excerpts from — The Light of Amen-Ra: The key role of projected images in the Pharaoh’s ritual renewal.” In &lt;Paleo-camera.com&gt; March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greek mystery cult rites==
Mystery religions dominated the Mediterranean sphere during classical antiquity. The foremost Mystery sect was the hallowed rite of the Goddess [[Persephone]] at Eleusis, Greece, which held sway for nearly two thousand years (from at least 1500 BCE until the end of fourth century CE). The [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] started out as a small localized religion, grew steadily, and were adopted as part of the state religion of nearby Athens around 600 BCE.

Inside the dark cavernous temple was a sacred smaller building that held cult objects, normally sculptural idols, and a very bright fire. In the temple, the initiates had a direct face-to-face experience with the gods, who appeared as phantoms of light. Plato describes initiates experiencing “perfect, simple, calm, and blissful apparitions [eudaímona phásmata] in a pure light …” ([[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhaedrus%3Asection%3D250c 250c]).

The optical principle of the camera obscura — an image cast into a dark area from an adjacent bright area via a small aperture — works irrespective of the scale of the dark and light areas. If the inside of a room is made very bright and the outside is very dark then a hole will cast the image from the smaller space to the larger, rather like a movie projector in a theater.&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2016). “The Eleusinian Projector: The hierophant’s optical method of conjuring the goddess.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Gatton has proposed the priests (or priestesses) at Eleusis had operated a rudimentary projection booth, an "Eleusinian Projector", where the priest’s holy fire-room acted as the box of light and the dark cavernous space crowded with initiates was the theater.

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The initiates were not directing their attention toward the priest or the sacred house, but looking the other direction at spectral images that they believed were gods, shining and moving about…” 	-Matt Gatton&lt;ref&gt;Gatton, M. (2016). “The Eleusinian Projector: The hierophant’s optical method of conjuring the goddess.” In The Oxford Handbook of Light in Archaeology (Papadopoulos, C. and Moyes, H., eds.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History ==
Ascot Chang left his hometown, [[Fenghua District|Fenghua]], at age fourteen to apprentice under a master shirtmaker in [[Shanghai]]. In 1949, he leaves for Hong Kong where he starts taking orders for custom made shirts. Knocking on door after door, he visits the offices of Shanghainese businessmen who are not able to find high quality shirts in Hong Kong. 

By 1953, Ascot Chang opens his first 600 sq. ft store at 34 Kimberley Road. He opens his first branch at [[The Peninsula Hotels|the Peninsula Hotel]] in 1963, which is still open to this day. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ascotchang.com/en/heritage|title=Heritage|last=|first=|date=|website=Ascot Chang|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 17th, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, with sales negatively impacted by the [[Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots]], Ascot Chang goes on his first trunk show. Over three months, he visited twenty cities in the United States, including [[San Francisco]], [[Boston]], and [[New York City]]. 

When Ascot Chang suffered a heart attack in the 1970s, his son, Tony Chang, and his brother, Johnny Chang, started leading the company. Under the second generation of Changs, Ascot Chang spread worldwide, with their first international store opening in New York in 1986.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Currently, Ascot Chang has 15 locations across [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[United States|the United States]], and [[Philippines|the Philippines]].

== Style ==
The Ascot Chang house cut is a continental style that is characterized by medium shoulder padding, strong yet lightweight canvas structure, and a very slight roped shoulder. The styling leans towards a slim fit that balances aesthetics and comfort for a professional silhouette.

{{Economic anthropology}}

In [[trade]], '''barter''' (derived from ''baretor''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=English Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=119|year=1855|issue=8|pages=109-111}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a system of [[Exchange (economics) | exchange]] where participants in a [[financial transaction | transaction]] directly exchange [[Good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] for other goods or services without using a [[medium of exchange]], such as [[money]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = O'Sullivan |first = Arthur |author2= Steven M. Sheffrin |title = Economics: Principles in Action |publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall |year= 2003 |page= 243 |isbn= 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economist]]s distinguish barter from [[Gift economy|gift economies]] in many ways; barter, for example, features immediate [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocal exchange]], not delayed in time. Barter usually takes place on a [[Bilateral trade|bilateral]] basis, but may be [[Multilateral exchange|multilateral]] (i.e., mediated through a [[trade exchange]]). In most [[developed countries]], barter usually only exists parallel to monetary systems to a very limited extent. Market actors use barter as a replacement for money as the method of exchange in times of [[monetary crisis]], such as when [[currency]] becomes unstable (e.g., [[hyperinflation]] or a [[Deflation#Deflationary spiral|deflationary spiral]]) or simply unavailable for conducting [[commerce]].

Economists since the times of [[Adam Smith]] (1723-1790), looking at non-specific [[pre-modern societies]] as examples, have used the [[inefficiency]] of barter to explain the emergence of money, of "the" [[economy]], and hence of the discipline of [[economics]] itself.&lt;ref name="Graeber-p21-41"&gt;{{cite book|author= [[David Graeber]]|title= Debt: the first 5,000 years|year= 2011|publisher= Melville House|location= New York|pages= 21–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[ethnographic]] studies have shown that no present or past society has used barter without any other medium of exchange or measurement, nor have anthropologists found evidence that money emerged from barter, instead finding that gift-giving (credit extended on a personal basis with an inter-personal balance maintained over the long term) was the most usual means of exchange of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;

==Economic theory==
{{Economic systems sidebar}}

===Adam Smith on the origin of money===
[[Adam Smith]], the father of modern economics, sought to demonstrate that [[Market (economics)|markets]] (and economies) pre-existed the state, and hence should be free of government regulation{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. He argued (against conventional wisdom) that money was not the creation of governments. Markets emerged, in his view, out of the division of labour, by which individuals began to specialize in specific crafts and hence had to depend on others for subsistence goods. These goods were first exchanged by barter. Specialization depended on trade, but was hindered by the "double coincidence of wants" which barter requires, i.e., for the exchange to occur, each participant must want what the other has. To complete this hypothetical history, craftsmen would stockpile one particular good, be it salt or metal, that they thought no one would refuse. This is the origin of money according to Smith. Money, as a universally desired medium of exchange, allows each half of the transaction to be separated.&lt;ref name="Graeber-p21-41" /&gt;

Barter is characterized in Adam Smith's "''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''" by a disparaging vocabulary: "higgling, haggling, swapping, dickering." It has also been characterized as negative reciprocity, or "selfish profiteering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Barter, Exchange and Value: An Anthropological Approach|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=3|authorlink=Introduction|editor=Humphrey, Carolyn and Stephen Hugh-Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists have argued, in contrast, "that when something resembling barter ''does'' occur in stateless societies it is almost always between strangers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barter occurred between strangers, not fellow villagers, and hence cannot be used to naturalistically explain the origin of money without the state. Since most people engaged in trade knew each other, exchange was fostered through the extension of credit.&lt;ref name="Humphrey-p48"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=48|doi=10.2307/2802221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: the first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=New York|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcel Mauss, author of '[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]', argued that the first economic contracts were to ''not'' act in one's economic self-interest, and that before money, exchange was fostered through the processes of reciprocity and [[redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]], not barter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|pages=153–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyday exchange relations  in such societies are characterized by generalized reciprocity, or a non-calculative familial "communism" where each takes according to their needs, and gives as they have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: The First 5,000 Years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=94–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
Since direct barter does not require payment in money, it can be utilized when money is in short supply, when there is little information about the credit worthiness of trade partners, or when there is a lack of trust between those trading.

Barter is an option to those who cannot afford to store their small supply of wealth in money, especially in [[hyperinflation]] situations where money devalues quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|pages=66–7|doi=10.2307/2802221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===

The limitations of barter are often explained in terms of its inefficiencies in facilitating exchange in comparison to money.

It is said that barter is 'inefficient' because:

;There needs to be a 'double coincidence of wants'
: For barter to occur between two parties, both parties need to have what the other wants.
;There is no common measure of value
: In a monetary economy, money plays the role of a measure of value of all goods, so their values can be assessed against each other; this role may be absent in a barter economy.
;Indivisibility of certain goods
: If a person wants to buy a certain amount of another's goods, but only has for payment one indivisible unit of another good which is worth more than what the person wants to obtain, a barter transaction cannot occur.
;Lack of standards for deferred payments
: This is related to the absence of a common measure of value, although if the debt is denominated in units of the good that will eventually be used in payment, it is not a problem.
;Difficulty in storing wealth
: If a society relies exclusively on perishable goods, storing wealth for the future may be impractical.  However, some barter economies rely on durable goods like sheep or cattle for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Wright and Vincenzo Quadrini. Money and Banking.[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON302-1.3.pdf Chapter 3, Section 1: Of Love, Money, and Transactional Efficiency] Accessed June 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Silent trade===
{{Main article|Silent trade}}
[[File:Olaus Magnus - On Trade Without Using Money.jpg|thumb|Scandinavian and Russian traders bartering their wares. [[Olaus Magnus]], 1555]]
Other anthropologists have questioned whether barter is typically between "total" strangers, a form of barter known as "silent trade". Silent trade, also called silent barter, dumb barter ("dumb" here used in its old meaning of "mute"), or depot trade, is a method by which [[Merchant|traders]] who cannot speak each other's [[language]] can trade without talking. However, Benjamin Orlove has shown that while barter occurs through "silent trade" (between strangers), it also occurs in commercial markets as well. "Because barter is a difficult way of conducting trade, it will occur only where there are strong institutional constraints on the use of money or where the barter symbolically denotes a special social relationship and is used in well-defined conditions. To sum up, multipurpose money in markets is like lubrication for machines - necessary for the most efficient function, but not necessary for the existence of the market itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic Anthropology|year=1989|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|pages=179|author=Plattner, Stuart|authorlink=Markets and Marketplaces|editor=Plattner, Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of barter between coastal and inland villages in the [[Trobriand Islands]], Keith Hart highlighted the difference between highly ceremonial gift exchange between community leaders, and the barter that occurs between individual households. The haggling that takes place between strangers is possible because of the larger temporary political order established by the gift exchanges of leaders. From this he concludes that barter is "an atomized interaction predicated upon the presence of society" (i.e. that social order established by gift exchange), and not typical between complete strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Bloch|first=J. Parry|title=Money and the Morality of Exchange|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Times of monetary crisis===

As Orlove noted, barter may occur in commercial economies, usually during periods of monetary crisis. During such a crisis, currency may be in short supply, or highly devalued through hyperinflation. In such cases, money ceases to be the universal medium of exchange or standard of value. Money may be in such short supply that it becomes an item of barter itself rather than the means of exchange. Barter may also occur when people cannot afford to keep money (as when hyperinflation quickly devalues it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=52|doi=10.2307/2802221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this would be during the [[Crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela]], when Venezuelans resorted to bartering as a result of hyperinflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-barter/fish-for-flour-barter-is-the-new-currency-in-collapsing-venezuela-idUSKBN1JT1UM?il=0|title=Fish for flour? Barter is the new currency in collapsing Venezuela|last=Aponte|first=Andreina|date=|work=[[Reuters]]|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exchanges===
[[File:Trade with indians 1820.jpg|thumb|White traders bartering with the Indians c. 1820]]
Economic historian Karl Polanyi has argued that where barter is widespread, and cash supplies limited, barter is aided by the use of credit, brokerage, and money as a unit of account (i.e. used to price items). All of these strategies are found in ancient economies including Ptolemaic Egypt. They are also the basis for more recent barter exchange systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trade and Market in Early Empires|year=1957|publisher=The Free Press|location=Glencoe, Illinois|page=14|author=Polanyi, Karl|authorlink=Marketless Trading in Hammurabi's Time|editor=Polanyi, Karl|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While one-to-one bartering is practiced between individuals and businesses on an informal basis, organized barter exchanges have developed to conduct third party bartering which helps overcome some of the limitations of barter. A barter exchange operates as a broker and bank in which each participating member has an account that is debited when purchases are made, and credited when sales are made.

Modern barter and trade has evolved considerably to become an effective method of increasing sales, conserving cash, moving inventory, and making use of excess production capacity for businesses around the world. Businesses in a barter earn trade credits (instead of cash) that are deposited into their account. They then have the ability to purchase goods and services from other members utilizing their trade credits – they are not obligated to purchase from those whom they sold to, and vice versa. The exchange plays an important role because they provide the record-keeping, brokering expertise and monthly statements to each member. Commercial exchanges make money by charging a commission on each transaction either all on the buy side, all on the sell side, or a combination of both. Transaction fees typically run between 8 and 15%.

Throughout the 18th century, retailers began to abandon the prevailing system of bartering. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex in Paris, France were among the first in Europe to abandon the bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. The Palais retailers stocked luxury goods that appealed to the wealthy elite and upper middle classes. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, which adopted the trappings of a sophisticated, modern shopping complex and also changed pricing structures, for both the aristocracy and the middle classes.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,'' ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90–93&lt;/ref&gt;

The Owenite socialists in Britain and the United States in the 1830s were the first to attempt to organize barter exchanges. Owenism developed a "theory of equitable exchange" as a critique of the exploitative wage relationship between capitalist and labourer, by which all profit accrued to the capitalist. To counteract the uneven playing field between employers and employed, they proposed "schemes of labour notes based on labour time, thus institutionalizing Owen's demand that human labour, not money, be made the standard of value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Quest for the New Moral World: Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scibners Sons|location=New York|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; This alternate currency eliminated price variability between markets, as well as the role of merchants who bought low and sold high. The system arose in a period where paper currency was an innovation. Paper currency was an [[I.O.U.|IOU]] circulated by a bank (a promise to pay, not a payment in itself). Both merchants and an unstable paper currency created difficulties for direct producers.

An alternate currency, denominated in labour time, would prevent profit taking by middlemen; all goods exchanged would be priced only in terms of the amount of labour that went into them as expressed in the maxim '[[Cost the limit of price]]'. It became the basis of exchanges in London, and in America, where the idea was implemented at the [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] communal settlement by [[Josiah Warren]] in 1826, and in his Cincinnati 'Time store' in 1827. Warren ideas were adopted by other Owenites and currency reformers, even though the labour exchanges were relatively short lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Quest for the New Moral World: Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scibners Sons|location=New York|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, about 30 to 40 cooperative societies sent their surplus goods to an "exchange bazaar" for direct barter in London, which later adopted a similar labour note. The British Association for Promoting Cooperative Knowledge established an "equitable labour exchange" in 1830. This was expanded as the National Equitable Labour Exchange in 1832 on Grays Inn Road in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Quest for the New Moral World: Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scibners Sons|location=New York|pages=202–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts became the basis of the British cooperative movement of the 1840s. In 1848, the [[socialist]] and first self-designated [[anarchist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] postulated a system of ''time chits''.  In 1875, [[Karl Marx]] wrote of "Labor Certificates" (''Arbeitszertifikaten'') in his [[Critique of the Gotha Program]] of a "certificate from society that [the labourer] has furnished such and such an amount of labour", which can be used to draw "from the social stock of means of consumption as much as costs the same amount of labour."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/subject/japan/tsushima/labor-certificates.htm Tadayuki Tsushima, Understanding “Labor Certificates” on the Basis of the Theory of Value, 1956]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Twentieth century experiments====
{{main article|Time banking}}
The first exchange system was the Swiss [[WIR Bank]]. It was founded in 1934 as a result of currency shortages after the stock market crash of 1929. "WIR" is both an abbreviation of Wirtschaftsring (economic circle) and the word for "we" in German, reminding participants that the economic circle is also a community.&lt;ref name="reinventingmoney.com"&gt;{{cite web | title=60 Years WIR Business Circle Cooperative -Origins and Ideology | work=WIR Magazine (September 1994) | url=http://www.reinventingmoney.com/wirbusiness.php | accessdate=9 August 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061017101214/http://www.reinventingmoney.com/wirbusiness.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 17 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain (particularly the [[Catalonia]] region) there is a growing number of exchange markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These barter markets or swap meets work without money. Participants bring things they do not need and exchange them for the unwanted goods of another participant. Swapping among three parties often helps satisfy tastes when trying to get around the rule that money is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faircompanies.com/videos/view/barcelonas-barter-markets-an-antidote-to-overconsumption/ Barcelona's barter markets] (from faircompanies.com. Accessed 2009-06-29.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Linton originated the term "local exchange trading system" ([[LETS]]) in 1983 and for a time ran the [[Comox Valley, British Columbia|Comox Valley]] LETSystems in [[Courtenay, British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.ashevillelets.org/wiki/What_is_LETS%3F "What is LETS?". AshevilleLETS. Retrieved December 9, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; LETS networks use [[interest]]-free [[community-based economics|local]] [[credit (accounting)|credit]] so direct swaps do not need to be made. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network. In LETS, unlike other [[local currency|local currencies]], no [[scrip]] is issued, but rather transactions are recorded in a central location open to all members. As credit is issued by the network members, for the benefit of the members themselves, LETS are considered [[mutual credit]] systems.

====Modern developments====
According to the [[International Reciprocal Trade Association]], the industry trade body, more than 450,000 businesses transacted $10 billion globally in 2008 – and officials expect trade volume to grow by 15% in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1931665,00.html?xid=rss-topstories TIMES], nov. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that over 450,000 businesses in the United States were involved in barter exchange activities in 2010. There are approximately 400 commercial and corporate barter companies serving all parts of the world. There are many opportunities for entrepreneurs to start a barter exchange. Several major cities in the U.S. and Canada do not currently have a local [[barter exchange]]. There are two industry groups in the United States, the [http://www.natebarter.com National Association of Trade Exchanges] (NATE) and the International Reciprocal Trade Association (IRTA). Both offer training and promote high ethical standards among their members. Moreover, each has created its own currency through which its member barter companies can trade. NATE's currency is the known as the BANC and IRTA's currency is called Universal Currency (UC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grand Central Barter|url=http://www.grandcentralbarter.com|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, barter continues to thrive. The largest b2b barter exchange is [[Tradebank]], founded in 1987. P2P bartering has seen a renaissance in major Canadian cities through Bunz - built as a network of Facebook groups that went on to become a stand-alone bartering based app in January 2016. Within the first year, Bunz accumulated over 75,000 users&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-24/maybe-mark-zuckerberg-should-listen-to-these-canadian-hipsters|title=Facebook Is Trying To Build a Successful Online Marketplace. Here’s How One Group Did.|date=2016-10-24|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in over 200 cities worldwide.

In the United States, the largest barter exchange and corporate trade group is [[International Monetary Systems]], founded in 1985, now with representation in various countries.

In Australia and New Zealand the largest barter exchange is [[Bartercard]], founded in 1991, with offices in the United Kingdom, United States, Cyprus, UAE and Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bartercard International|url=http://www.bartercard.com.au/bartercard_international.html|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Corporation|Corporate]] barter focuses on larger transactions, which is different from a traditional, retail oriented barter exchange.  Corporate barter exchanges typically use media and advertising as leverage for their larger transactions.  It entails the use of a currency unit called a "trade-credit".  The trade-credit must not only be known and guaranteed, but also be valued in an amount the media and advertising could have been purchased for had the "client" bought it themselves (contract to eliminate ambiguity and risk).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Soviet [[bilateral trade]] is occasionally called "barter trade", because although the purchases were denominated in U.S. dollars, the transactions were credited to an international [[clearing account]], avoiding the use of hard cash.

==Tax implications==
In the United States, [[Karl Hess]] used bartering to make it harder for the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] to seize his wages and as a form of [[tax resistance]]. Hess explained how he turned to barter in an [[op-ed]] for ''The New York Times'' in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=We Won’t Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader|editor=David M. Gross|year=2008|pages=437–440}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the IRS now requires barter exchanges to be reported as per the [[Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982]]. Barter exchanges are considered taxable revenue by the IRS and must be reported on a 1099-B form. According to the IRS, "The fair market value of goods and services exchanged must be included in the [[income]] of both parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc420.html|title=Tax Topics - Topic 420 Bartering Income|publisher=United States Internal Revenue Service|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries, though, do not have the reporting requirement that the U.S. does concerning proceeds from barter transactions, but taxation is handled the same way as a cash transaction. If one barters for a [[profit (accounting)|profit]], one pays the appropriate tax; if one generates a loss in the transaction, they have a loss. Bartering for business is also taxed accordingly as business income or business expense.  Many barter exchanges require that one register as a business.

==Recent developments==

Since the 1830s, barter in some [[western world | western]] [[market economies]] has been aided by exchanges which use alternative currencies based on the [[labour theory of value]], and which are intended to prevent [[profit taking | profit-taking]] by [[intermediary | intermediaries]]. Examples include the [[Owenite]] socialists, the [[Cincinnati Time Store|Cincinnati Time store]], and more recently{{when?|date=June 2018}} [[Ithaca Hours|Ithaca HOURS]] ([[time banking]]) and the [[Local exchange trading system | LETS system]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3522">'''Causerie''' (from French, "talk, chat") is a [[literary]] style of short informal essays mostly unknown in the [[English language|English-speaking world]].&lt;ref&gt;"There is no English equivalent for ''causerie'', which is something less formal, continuous, and pretentious than 'conversation,' something more intellectual, refined, and cultivated than 'talk.' An earnest preoccupied man may converse: an over-excited or coarse-minded man may talk; but neither the one nor the other can ''causer'' in the precise French acceptation of the word. Boswell says, 'Though his (Johnson's) usual phrase for conversation was 'talk,' yet he made a distinction; for when he once told me that he dined the day before at a friend's house, with 'a very pretty company,' and I asked him if there was good conversation, he answered, 'No, sir, we had 'talk' but no conversation; there was nothing discussed.' On another occasion, however, when he said there had been good 'talk,' Boswell rejoined, 'Yes, sir, you tossed and gored several persons.' Positiveness, loudness, love of argument and eagerness for display, are fatal to ''causerie''; which we take to consist in the easy, careless, unforced flow of remarks, fancies, feelings, or thoughts, – the results of reading, observation, or reflection [...] In Strictness, therefore, perhaps the title of ''causeries'' should only be given to such a book as we should call 'Table-Talk'." — Hayward, Abraham (1873). [https://archive.org/stream/biographicalcrit04hayw#page/n13/mode/2up "Varieties of History and Art."] In: ''Biographical and Critical Essays,'' Vol., II. London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; A causerie is generally short, light and humorous and is often published as a [[Columnist|newspaper column]] (although it is not defined by its format). Often the causerie is a current-opinion piece, but it contains more verbal acrobatics and humor than a regular opinion or column. In English, causerie is commonly known as "personal story", "talk of the town",&lt;ref&gt;Kinnunen, Aarne: ”Pakina.” ''Otavan Suuri Ensyklopedia 7'', pp. 5011–5012. Helsinki: Otava, 1979. {{ISBN|951-1-05468-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "funny story" or "column" instead.

The causerie style is characterized by a personal approach to the reader; the writer "babbles" to the reader, from which the term derives. Language jokes, [[hyperbole]], intentional disregard of linguistic and stylistic norms, and other absurd or humorous elements are permitted. For example, in a causerie about a politician, she or he may be placed in an imagined situation. Sentences are usually kept short, avoiding over-explaining, and room is left for the reader to read between the lines.

The content of causerie is not limited and it may be [[satire]], [[parody]], opinion, factual or straight fiction. Causerie is not defined by content or format, but style. Although usually published in a newspaper, many authors have published anthologies.
The causerie as a form became popular in the English-speaking world during the later nineteenth-century following the widely published and influential essays of [[Andrew Lang]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

'''Childhood in medieval England''' was determined by both social and biological factors.  According to [[common law]], [[childhood]] ranged from the [[childbirth|birth]] of a [[child]] until he or she reached the age of 12.  At this point, the child was seen as capable and competent to understand his or her actions, thus rendering them responsible for them.  According to [[canon law]], [[girl]]s could marry at the age of 12 and [[boy]]s at the age of 14.

== The first year ==
For most children growing up in [[England in the Middle Ages|Medieval England]] the first year of life was one of the most dangerous, with as many as 50 percent of children succumbing to fatal illness.  During this year the child was cared for and nursed, either by parents (if the family belonged to the [[peasant]] class) or (perhaps) by a [[wet nurse]] if the child belonged to a [[Nobility|noble]] [[social class|class]].

== {{anchor|Age 7 to 12}}Ages seven to twelve ==
At age seven [[Play (activity)|play]] was still an important part of the child's life; however, as the child's ability to learn and fulfil [[family]] duties grew, so did their responsibility to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://past.oxfordjournals.org/content/148/1/48.extract "The Culture Of Children In Medieval England"].

[[Peasant]] and urban children took up responsibilities around the house.

== {{anchor|Entering the Adolescent Phase Age 12-14}}Adolescence (ages 12–14)==
By age 12, the child began to take on a more serious role in family duties.  Although according to canon law at the age of twelve girls could marry, this was relatively uncommon unless the child was an [[Inheritance|heiress]] or belonged to a family of noble birth.  Peasant children at this age stayed at home and continued to learn and develop domestic skills and husbandry.  Urban children moved out of their homes and into the homes of their employer, or master (depending on their future roles as [[domestic worker|servants]] or [[apprentice]]s).  Noble boys learned skills in arms, and noble girls learned basic domestic skills.
The end of childhood and entrance into [[adolescence]] was marked by leaving home and moving to the house of the employer (or master), entering a [[university]] or into church service.

[[File:Ywain-Gawain.JPG|thumb|[[Yvain]] fighting [[Gawain]]. Medieval illumination from [[Chrétien de Troyes]]'s romance, ''[[Yvain, le Chevalier au Lion]]'']]

As a [[literary genre]] of [[high culture]], '''romance''' or '''chivalric romance''' is a type of [[prose]] and [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] [[narrative]] that was popular in the aristocratic circles of [[High Middle Ages|High Medieval]] and [[Early Modern Europe]]. They were fantastic stories about marvel-filled [[adventure]]s, often of a [[chivalry|chivalric]] [[knight-errant]] portrayed as having [[hero]]ic qualities, who goes on a [[quest]].  It developed further from the epics as time went on; in particular, "the emphasis on love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the ''[[chanson de geste]]'' and other kinds of [[epic poetry|epic]], in which masculine military heroism predominates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Chris Baldick |entry=Chivalric Romance |title= The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms |date=2008 |edition=3rd |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-19-172717-7 |oclc= 4811919031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with [[Irony|ironic]], [[satire|satiric]], or [[burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] intent. Romances reworked [[legend]]s, [[fairy tale]]s, and history to suit the readers' and hearers' tastes, but by c. 1600 they were out of fashion, and [[Miguel de Cervantes]] famously [[burlesque]]d them in his novel ''[[Don Quixote]]''. Still, the [[medievalism|modern image of "medieval"]] is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word ''medieval'' evokes knights, [[damsel in distress|distressed damsels]], [[dragon]]s, and other romantic [[trope (literature)|tropes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=C. S. |author-link=C. S. Lewis |title=[[The Discarded Image]] |location=Cambridge |date=1994 |edition=Canto |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-47735-2 |page=9 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, romance literature was written in [[Old French]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], [[Occitan]], and [[Franco-Provençal language|Provençal]], and later in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Castilian]], [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]] (Sicilian poetry), and [[German language|German]]. During the early 13th century, romances were increasingly written as prose. In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of [[courtly love]], such as faithfulness in adversity.

==Form==
Unlike the later form of the [[novel]] and like the [[chansons de geste]], the genre of romance dealt with traditional themes.  These were distinguished from earlier [[epic poetry|epics]] by heavy use of marvelous events, the elements of love, and the frequent use of a web of interwoven stories, rather than a simple plot unfolding about a main character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lewis | first=C. S. | title=A Preface to Paradise Lost | location=London | date=1961 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-500345-1 | page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest forms were invariably in verse, but the 15th century saw many in prose, often retelling the old, rhymed versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Huizinga | first=Johan | title=The Autumn of the Middle Ages | location=Chicago | date=1996 | publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn=978-0-226-35992-2 | page=354 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The romantic form pursued the wish-fulfillment dream where the heroes and heroines were considered representations of the ideals of the age while the villains embodied the threat to their ascendancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fantastic Literature: A Critical Reader|last=Sandner|first=David|publisher=Praeger|year=2004|isbn=0275980537|location=Westport, CT|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a persistent archetype, which involved a hero's quest. This quest or journey served as the structure that held the narrative together. With regards to the structure, scholars recognize the similarity of the romance to folk tales. Vladimir Propp identified a basic form for this genre and it involved an order that began with initial situation, then followed by departure, complication, first move, second move, and resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Literature of Hope in the Middle Ages and Today: Connections in Medieval Romance, Modern Fantasy, and Science Fiction|last=Keyes|first=Flo|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2006|isbn=0786425962|location=Jefferson|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; This structure is also applicable to romance narratives.

===Cycles===
[[File:Holger danske.jpg|right|thumb|Holger Danske,
or Ogier the Dane, from the Matter of France]]
Overwhelmingly, these were linked in some way, perhaps only in an opening [[frame story]], with three thematic cycles of tales: these were assembled in imagination at a late date as the "[[Matter of Rome]]" (actually centered on the life and deeds of [[Alexander the Great]] conflated with the [[Trojan War]]), the "[[Matter of France]]" ([[Charlemagne]] and [[Roland]], his principal [[paladin]]) and the "[[Matter of Britain]]" (the lives and deeds of [[King Arthur]] and the Knights of the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]], within which was incorporated the quest for the [[Holy Grail]]); medieval authors explicitly described these as comprising all romances.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA&gt;{{cite book | last1=Hibbard | first1=Laura A. | last2=Loomis | first2=Laura A. | title=Medieval Romance in England: A Study of the Sources and Analogues of the Non-Cyclic Metrical Romances | location=New York | year=1963 | publisher=Burt Franklin | isbn=978-0-8337-2144-0 | page=iii | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, a number of "non-cyclical" romances were written without any such connection;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; these include such romances as ''[[King Horn]]'',{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|p=83}} ''[[Robert the Devil]]'',{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|p=49}} ''[[Ipomadon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Purdie, Rhiannon. 2001.  ''Ipomadon''. Oxford University Press for the Early English Text Society.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Emaré]]'',{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|p=23}} ''[[Havelok the Dane]]'',{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|p=103}}''[[Roswall and Lillian]]'',{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|p=290}} ''[[Le Bone Florence of Rome]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Heffernan | first=Carol Falvo | title=Le Bone Florence of Rome | location=Manchester | date=1976 | publisher=Manchester University Press | isbn=978-0-7190-0647-0 | oclc=422642874}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Amadas]]''.{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|p=73}}

Indeed, some tales are found so often that scholars group them together as the "[[The Man of Law's Tale|Constance]] cycle" or the "[[Crescentia (romance)|Crescentia]] cycle"—referring not to a continuity of character and setting, but to the recognizable plot.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The medieval romance developed out of the medieval epic, in particular the [[Matter of France]] developing out of such tales as the ''[[Chanson de Geste]]'', with intermediate forms where the feudal bonds of loyalty had giants, or a magical horn, added to the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ker | first=William Paton | author-link=W. P. Ker | title=Epic and Romance: Essays on Medieval Literature | date=1908 | url=https://archive.org/details/epicromanceessay00kerwuoft | publisher=Macmillan | location=London | page=53 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The epics of [[Charlemagne]], unlike such ones as ''[[Beowulf]]'', already had feudalism rather than the tribal loyalties; this was to continue in romances.{{sfn|Ker|1908|p=52}}

===Contemporary society===
The romance form is distinguished from the earlier [[Epic poetry|epics]] of the Middle Ages by the changes of the 12th century, which introduced courtly and chivalrous themes into the works.{{sfn|Ker|1908|pp=3–4}} This occurred regardless of congruity to the source material; Alexander the Great featured as a fully feudal king.{{sfn|Ker|1908|p=27}} Chivalry was treated as continuous from Roman times.{{sfn|Huizinga|1996|pp=75}} This extended even to such details as clothing; when in the ''[[Seven Sages of Rome]]'', the son of an (unnamed) emperor of Rome wears the clothing of a sober Italian citizen, and when his stepmother attempts to seduce him, her clothing is described in medieval terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Scott | first=Margaret | title=Medieval Dress &amp; Fashion | location=London | date=2007 | publisher=The British Library | isbn=978-0-7123-0675-1 | pages=137–140 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Priam sends Paris to Greece in a 14th-century work, Priam is dressed in the mold of Charlemagne, and Paris is dressed demurely, but in Greece, he adopts the flashier style, with multicolored clothing and fashionable shoes, cut in lattice-work—signs of a seducer in the era.{{sfn|Scott|2007|p=93}}

Historical figures reappeared, reworked, in romance.  The entire Matter of France derived from known figures, and suffered somewhat because their descendants had an interest in the tales that were told of their ancestors, unlike the Matter of Britain.  [[Richard Coeur de Lion]] reappeared in romance, endowed with a fairy mother who arrived in a ship with silk sails and departed when forced to behold the sacrament, bare-handed combat with a lion, magical rings, and prophetic dreams.{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|pp=148–153}} [[Hereward the Wake]]'s early life appeared in chronicles as the embellished, romantic adventures of an exile, complete with rescuing princess and wrestling with bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Keen | first=Maurice Hugh | title=The Outlaws of Medieval Legend | location=New York | date=1989 | publisher=Dorest Press | isbn=978-0-88029-454-6 | page=12 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fulk Fitzwarin]], an outlaw in King John's day, has his historical background a minor thread in the episodic stream of romantic adventures.{{sfn|Keen|1989|p=39}}

===Folklore and folktales===
The earliest medieval romances dealt heavily with themes from folklore, which diminished over time, though remaining a presence. Many early tales had the knight, such as [[Sir Launfal]], meet with [[fairy]] ladies, and [[Huon of Bordeaux]] is aided by [[Oberon (Fairy King)|King Oberon]],{{sfn|Lewis|1994|pp=129–130}} but these fairy characters were transformed, more and more often, into wizards and enchantresses.&lt;ref name=fairies&gt;{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=Katharine M.|author-link=Katharine Mary Briggs|title=An Encyclopedia of Fairies: Hoglobins, Brownies, Bogies and Othersupernatural Creatures|location=New York|date=1977|publisher=Pantheon|isbn=978-0-394-73467-5|chapter=Fairies in medieval romances|page=132|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morgan le Fay]] never loses her name, but in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', she studies magic rather than being inherently magical.{{sfn|Briggs|1977|loc="Morgan Le Fay"|p=303}} Similarly, knights lose magical abilities.&lt;ref name=fairies/&gt; Still, fairies never completely vanished from the tradition. ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' is a late tale, but the [[Green Knight]] himself is an otherworldly being.&lt;ref name=fairies/&gt;

Early persecuted heroines were often driven from their husbands' homes by the persecutions of their mothers-in-law, whose motives are seldom delineated, and whose accusations are of the heroines' having borne monstrous children, committed infanticide, or practiced witchcraft — all of which appear in such [[fairy tale]]s as ''[[The Girl Without Hands]]'' and many others. As time progressed, a new persecutor appeared: a courtier who was rejected by the woman or whose ambition requires her removal, and who accuses her of adultery or high treason, motifs not duplicated in fairy tales.&lt;ref name="accused62"/&gt;  While he never eliminates the mother-in-law, many romances such as ''[[Valentine and Orson]]'' have later variants that change from the mother-in-law to the courtier, whereas a more recent version never goes back.&lt;ref name="accused62"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schlauch | first=Margaret | author-link=Margaret Schlauch | title=Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens | location=New York | date=1969 | publisher=Gordian Press | pages=62–63 | oclc=892031418}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Italy there is the story called ''Il Bel Gherardino''. It is the most ancient prototype of an Italian singing fairy tale by an anonymous Tuscan author. It tells the story of a young Italian knight, depleted for its "magnanimitas", who gets the love of a fairy. When he loses this love because he does not comply with his conditions, Gherardino reconquers his lady after a series of labours, including the prison where he is rescued by another woman and a tournament where he wins. Other examples of Italian (Tuscan) poetry tales are Antonio Pucci's literature: ''Gismirante, Il Brutto di Bretagna'' or ''Brito di Bretagna'' ("The ugly knight of Britain") and ''Madonna Lionessa'' ("Lioness Lady"). Another work of a second anonymous Italian author that is worth mentioning is ''Istoria di Tre Giovani Disperati e di Tre Fate'' ("Story of three desperate boys and three fairies").

===Classical origins===
Some romances, such as ''[[Apollonius of Tyre]]'', show classical pagan origins.{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|p=169}} Tales of the [[Matter of Rome]] in particular may be derived from such works as the [[Alexander Romance]].  Ovid was used as a source for tales of Jason and Medea, which were cast in romance in a more fairy-tale like form, probably closer to the older forms than Ovid's rhetoric.{{sfn|Ker|1908|p=382}} It also drew upon the traditions of magic that were attributed to such figures as Virgil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Jolly | first1=Karen Louise | last2=Raudvere | first2=Catharina | last3=Peters | first3=Edward | last4=Ankarloo | first4=Bengt | last5=Clark | first5=Stuart | chapter=Medieval Magic:  Definitions, Beliefs, Practices|  title=The Middle Ages | location=Philadelphia | series=Witchcraft and Magic in Europe | volume=3 | date=2002 | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press | isbn=978-0-8122-1786-5 | page=68 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious practices===
The Arthurian cycle also contains many magical elements, some of which appear to be Celtic in origin, but which are chiefly drawn from Christian ritual and story.{{sfn|Jolly|Raudvere|Peters|Ankarloo|2002|p=68}}

===Courtly love===
The new [[courtly love]] was not one of the original elements of the genre, but quickly became very important when introduced.

It was introduced to the romance by [[Chretien de Troyes]], combining it with the Matter of Britain, new to French poets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lewis | first=C. S. | title=The Allegory of Love: A Study in Medieval Tradition | location=Oxford | series=Oxford Paperbacks | date=1995| publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-281220-9 | page=23 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]'' (unlike his earlier ''[[Erec and Enide]]''), the behavior of Lancelot conforms to the courtly love ideal;{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=26}} it also, though still full of adventure, devotes an unprecedented amount of time to dealing with the psychological aspects of the love.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=29}}  By the end of the 14th century, counter to the earliest formulations, many French and English romances combined courtly love, with love sickness and devotion on the man's part, with the couple's subsequent marriage; this featured in ''[[Sir Degrevant]]'', ''[[Sir Torrent of Portyngale]]'', ''[[Sir Eglamour of Artois|Sir Eglamour]]'', and ''[[William of Palerne]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Sayers | editor-first=Dorothy | title=Essays Presented to Charles Williams | location=Grand Rapids, Michigan | date=1981 | publisher=Eerdmans | isbn=978-0-8028-1117-2 | last=Mathew | first=Gervase | chapter=Marriage and ''Amour Courtois'' in Late Fourteenth Century England | page=132–133 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Ipomadon]]'' even explicitly describes the married couple as lovers, and the plot of ''[[Sir Otuel]]'' was altered, to allow him to marry Belyssant.{{sfn|Mathew|1981|p=133}} Similarly, Iberian romances of the 14th century praised monogamy and marriage in such tales as ''[[Tirant lo Blanc]]'' and ''[[Amadis of Gaul]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Seed | first=Patricia | author-link=Patricia Seed| title=To Love, Honor, and Obey in Colonial Mexico: Conflicts Over Marriage Choice, 1574-1821 | date=2004 | isbn=978-0-8047-2159-2 | page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early forms==
[[File:Dobryna.jpg|thumb|right|A knight rescues a lady from a dragon.]]
Many medieval romances recount the marvellous [[adventure]]s of a chivalrous, [[hero]]ic [[knight]], often of super-human ability, who, abiding chivalry's strict codes of honor and demeanor, goes on a [[quest]], and fights and defeats monsters and giants, thereby winning favor with a [[princesse lointaine|lady]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Frye | first=Northrop | title=[[Anatomy of Criticism|Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays]] | location=Princeton, New Jersey | | date=1973 | edition=3rd print | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=978-0-691-06004-0 | page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Matter of France, most popular early, did not lend itself to the subject of [[courtly love]], but rather dealt with heroic adventure: in ''[[The Song of Roland]]'', Roland, though betrothed to Oliver's sister, does not think of her during the course of events.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=9}} The themes of love were, however, to soon appear, particularly in the Matter of Britain, leading to even the French regarding King Arthur's court as the exemplar of true and noble love, so much so that even the earliest writers about courtly love would claim it had reached its true excellence there, and love was not what it was in King Arthur's day.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=24}}   A perennial theme was [[princess and dragon|the rescue of a lady from the imperiling monster]], a theme that would remain throughout the romances of the medieval era.{{sfn|Huizinga|1996|pp=83–84}}

Originally, this literature was written in [[Old French]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Occitan]], later, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]&amp;mdash; amongst the important Spanish texts were [[Cantar de Mio Cid]] and [[Book of the Knight Zifar]]; notable later English works being [[King Horn]] (a translation of the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] (AN) [[Romance of Horn]] of Mestre Thomas), and [[Havelok the Dane]] (a translation of the anonymous AN Lai d'Haveloc); around the same time [[Gottfried von Strassburg]]'s version of the [[Tristan]] of [[Thomas of Britain]] (a different Thomas to the author of 'Horn') and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s [[Parzival]] translated classic French romance narrative into the German tongue.

== Forms of the High Middle Ages ==
During the early 13th century, romances were increasingly written as prose, and extensively amplified through cycles of continuation.  These were collated in the vast, polymorphous manuscript witnesses comprising what is now known as the [[Vulgate Cycle]], with the romance of [[La Mort le Roi Artu]] c. 1230, perhaps its final installment.  These texts, together with a wide range of further Arthurian material, such as that found in the anonymous cycle of English [[Brut Chronicles]], comprised the bases of [[Malory]]'s [[Morte d'Arthur]].  Prose literature thus increasingly dominated the expression of romance narrative in the later Middle Ages, at least until the resurgence of verse during the high Renaissance in the oeuvres of [[Ludovico Ariosto]], [[Torquato Tasso]], and [[Edmund Spenser]].

In Old Norse, they are the prose ''[[riddarasögur]]'' or chivalric sagas.  The genre began in thirteenth-century Norway with translations of French ''chansons de geste''; it soon expanded to similar indigenous creations. The early fourteenth century saw the emergence of Scandinavian verse romance in Sweden under the patronage of Queen [[Euphemia of Rügen]], who commissioned the ''[[Eufemiavisorna]]''.

==Late Medieval and Renaissance forms==

In late [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] high culture, the important European literary trend was to fantastic fictions in the mode of Romance. Exemplary work, such as the English ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''  by Sir Thomas Malory (c. 1408&amp;ndash;1471), the Catalan ''[[Tirant lo Blanch]]'', and the Castilian or Portuguese ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'' (1508), spawned many imitators, and the genre was popularly well-received, producing such masterpiece of Renaissance poetry as [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' and [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''[[Gerusalemme Liberata]]'' and other 16th-century literary works in the romance genre.  The romances were freely drawn upon for royal pageantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Strong | first=Roy C. | title=Splendor at Court: Renaissance Spectacle and the Theater of Power | location=Boston | date=1973 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | isbn=978-0-395-17220-9 | page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Queen Elizabeth I's Accession Day tilts, for instance, drew freely on the multiplicity of incident from romances for the knights' disguises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Strong | first=Roy C. | title=The Cult of Elizabeth: Elizabethan Portraiture and Pageantry | date=1977 | publisher=University of California Press | isbn=978-0-520-05840-8 | page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Knights even assumed the names of romantic figures, such as the [[Swan Knight]], or the coat-of-arms of such figures as Lancelot or Tristan.{{sfn|Huizinga|1996|pp=90–91}}

From the high Middle Ages, in works of piety, clerical critics often deemed romances to be harmful worldly distractions from more substantive or moral works, and by 1600 many secular readers would agree; in the judgement of many learned readers in the shifting intellectual atmosphere of the 17th century, the romance was trite and childish literature, inspiring only broken-down ageing and provincial persons such as [[Don Quixote]], knight of the culturally isolated province of [[La Mancha]].  ''[[Hudibras]]'' also lampoons the faded conventions of chivalrous romance, from an ironic, consciously realistic viewpoint. Some of the magical and exotic atmosphere of Romance informed tragedies for the stage, such as [[John Dryden]]'s collaborative ''[[The Indian Queen (play)|The Indian Queen]]'' (1664) as well as [[Restoration spectacular]]s  and ''[[opera seria]]'', such as [[Handel]]'s ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]'' (1711), based on a magical interlude in [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]'s ''[[Gerusalemme liberata]]''.

In the [[Renaissance]], also, the romance genre was bitterly attacked as barbarous and silly by the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]], who exalted Greek and Latin classics and classical forms, an attack that was not in that century very effective among the common readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lewis | first=C. S. | title=English Literature in the Sixteenth Century: Excluding Drama| location=Oxford | date=1954 | publisher=Clarendon Press | oclc=634408223 | page=29 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, romances continued; heavily rhetorical, they often had complex plots and high sentiment,{{sfn|Lewis|1954|p=421}} such as in [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]]'s ''[[Pandosto]]'' (the source for [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''){{sfn|Lewis|1954|p=422}} and [[Thomas Lodge]]'s ''[[Rosalynde]]'' (based on the medieval romance ''[[Gamelyn]]'' and the source for ''[[As You Like It]]''), ''Robert Duke of Normandy'' (based on [[Robert the Devil]]) and ''A Margarite of America''.{{sfn|Lewis|1954|p=423–424}}

''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605, 1615), by [[Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra]] (1547&amp;ndash;1616),  is a satirical story of an elderly country gentleman, living in La Mancha province, who is so obsessed by chivalric romances that he seeks to emulate their various heroes.

==Related forms==
The [[Acritic songs]] (dealing with [[Digenis Acritas]] and his fellow frontiersmen) resemble much the ''chanson de geste'', though they developed simultaneously but separately. These songs dealt with the hardships and adventures of the border guards of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantium) - including their love affairs - and where a predominantly oral tradition which survived in the Balkans and Anatolia until modern times. This genre may have intermingled with its Western counterparts during the long occupation of Byzantine territories by French and Italian knights after the 4th crusade. This is suggested by later works in the Greek language which show influences from both traditions.

==Relationship to modern "romantic fiction"==
In later Romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of [[courtly love]], such as faithfulness in adversity. From c. 1760 - usually cited as 1764 at the publication of [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' - the connotations of "romance" moved from fantastic and eerie, somewhat [[Gothic literature|Gothic]] adventure narratives of novelists like [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[A Sicilian Romance]]'' (1790) or ''[[The Romance of the Forest]]'' (1791) with erotic content to novels centered on the episodic development of a [[courtship]] that ends in marriage. With a female protagonist, during the rise of [[Romanticism]] the depiction of the course of such a courtship within contemporary conventions of [[realism (arts)|realism]], the female equivalent of the "[[Bildungsroman|novel of education]]", informs much [[Romantism#Romantic authors|Romantic fiction]]. In gothic novels such as [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', the elements of romantic seduction and [[desire (emotion)|desire]] were mingled with fear and dread.  [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] used the term to distinguish his works as romances rather than novels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=O'Connor | first=Flannery | title=Mystery and Manners: Occasional Prose | location=New York | date=1984 | edition=12th print | publisher=Farrar, Straus [and] Giroux | isbn=978-0-374-50804-3 | page=38 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and literary criticism of the 19th century often accepted the contrast between the romance and the novel, in such works as [[H. G. Wells]]'s "scientific romances" in the beginning of [[science fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Atwood | first1=Margaret | author-link=Margaret Atwood| title=Writing With Intent: Essays, Reviews, Personal Prose, 1983-2005 | location=New York | date=2005 | publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers | isbn=978-0-7867-1535-0 | page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1825, the [[fantasy]] genre developed when the Swedish literary work ''[[Frithjof's saga]]'', which was based on the ''[[Friðþjófs saga ins frœkna]]'', became successful in [[England]] and [[Germany]]. It was translated twenty-two times into English, 20 times into German, and into many other European languages, including modern Icelandic in 1866. Their influence on authors such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[William Morris]] and [[Poul Anderson]] and on the subsequent modern fantasy genre is considerable.

Modern usage of term "romance" usually refer to the [[romance novel]], which is a subgenre that focuses on the relationship and [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] between two people; these novels must have an "emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending."&lt;ref name="rwadefn"&gt;{{cite web | title = Romance Novels--What Are They? | publisher = [[Romance Writers of America]] | url = https://www.rwanational.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=rwa&amp;WebKey=18bbfbec-455e-43ff-904d-61b1333ab206 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061003170056/https://www.rwanational.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=RWA&amp;WebKey=18bbfbec-455e-43ff-904d-61b1333ab206 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2006-10-03 | accessdate = 2007-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the popularity of this popular meaning of Romance, other works are still, occasionally, referred to as romances because of their uses of other elements descended from the medieval romance, or from the Romantic movement:  larger-than-life heroes and heroines, drama and adventure, marvels that may become fantastic, themes of honor and loyalty, or fairy-tale-like stories and story settings.  Shakespeare's later comedies, such as ''[[The Tempest]]'' or ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' are sometimes called his [[Shakespeare's late romances|romances]].  Modern works may differentiate from love-story as romance into different genres, such as [[planetary romance]] or [[Ruritanian romance]].  [[Science fiction]] was, for a time, termed [[scientific romance]], and [[gaslamp fantasy]] is sometimes termed gaslight romance.  [[Flannery O'Conner]], writing of the use of grotesque in fiction, talked of its use in "the modern romance tradition."{{sfn|O'Connor|1984|p=39}}

{{sociolinguistics}}
{{Linguistics}}

In [[linguistics]], '''code-switching''' occurs when a speaker alternates between two or more [[language]]s, or language [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]], in the context of a single conversation. [[Multilingualism|Multilinguals]], speakers of more than one language, sometimes use elements of multiple languages when conversing with each other. Thus, code-switching is the use of more than one linguistic variety in a manner consistent with the [[syntax]] and [[phonology]] of each variety.

Code-switching is distinct from other [[language contact]] phenomena, such as [[Loanword|borrowing]], [[pidgin]]s and [[Creole language|creoles]], [[Calque|loan translation (calques)]], and [[language transfer]] (language interference). Borrowing affects the [[lexicon]], the words that make up a language, while code-switching takes place in individual [[utterance]]s.&lt;ref name="Gumperz"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gumperz |first=John J. |year=1982 |title=Discourse Strategies |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUJNgHWl_koC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22code-switching%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poplack 1984 99–136"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Poplack |first=Shana |author2=David Sankoff |year=1984 |title=Borrowing: the synchrony of integration |journal=Linguistics |volume=22 |pages=99–136 |issue=269 |doi=10.1515/ling.1984.22.1.99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Muysken 1995 177–98"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Muysken |first=Pieter |year=1995 |chapter=Code-switching and grammatical theory |editor=L.

In the 1940s and the 1950s, many scholars considered code-switching to be a substandard use of language.&lt;ref name="Weinreich"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weinreich |first=Uriel |year=1953 |title=Languages in Contact |location=The Hague |publisher=Mouton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, however, most scholars have come to regard it as a normal, natural product of bilingual and multilingual language use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1044/0161-1461(2005/026) |last=Goldstein |first=B. |author2=Kohnert, K. |year=2005 |title=Speech, language and hearing in developing bilingual children: Current findings and future directions |journal=Language, Speech and Hearing services in Schools |volume=36 |pages=264–67 |issue=3}}

The term "code-switching" is also used outside the field of linguistics. Some scholars of literature use the term to describe literary styles that include elements from more than one language, as in novels by Chinese-American, Anglo-Indian, or Latino writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Torres |first=Lourdes |title=In the Contact Zone: Code-Switching Strategies by Latino/a Writers |journal=Melus |volume=32 |year=2007 |pages=75–96 |issue=1 |doi=10.1093/melus/32.1.75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular usage, ''code-switching'' is sometimes used to refer to relatively stable informal [[Code-mixing#As fused lect|mixtures of two languages]], such as [[Spanglish]], [[Taglish]], or [[Hinglish]].&lt;ref name=Zentella/&gt; Both in popular usage and in sociolinguistic study, the name code-switching is sometimes used to refer to switching among [[dialect]]s, [[style-shifting|styles]] or [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Demby|first1=Gene |title=How Code-Switching Explains The World |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/04/08/176064688/how-code-switching-explains-the-world |accessdate=20 September 2016 |date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of switching is practiced, for example, by speakers of [[African American Vernacular English]] as they move from less formal to more formal settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=DeBose |first=Charles |year=1992 |chapter=Codeswitching: Black English and Standard English in the African-American linguistic repertoire |editor-last=Eastman |editor-first=Carol |title=Codeswitching |location=Clevedon |publisher=Multilingual Matters |pages=157–167 |isbn=1-85359-167-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such shifts, when performed by public figures such as politicians, are sometimes criticized as signalling [[Authenticity (philosophy)|inauthenticity]] or insincerity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanngieser|first=Anja|title=A sonic geography of voice: Towards an affective politics|journal=Progress in Human Geography|volume=36|issue=3|pages=336–353|year=2012|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0309132511423969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social motivations==&lt;!-- [[Code mixing]] links here --&gt;

Code-switching relates to, and sometimes [[Indexicality|indexes]] social-group membership in bilingual and multilingual communities. Some sociolinguists describe the relationships between code-switching behaviours and [[Social class|class]], [[ethnicity]], and other social positions.&lt;ref&gt;See:

In addition, scholars in [[interactional linguistics]] and [[conversation analysis]] have studied code-switching as a means of structuring speech in interaction.&lt;ref name="Li1998"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Li |last=Wei |authorlink= Li Wei (linguist) |year=1998|chapter=The 'Why' and 'How' Questions in the Analysis of Conversational Codeswitching |title=Code-Switching in Conversation: Language, Interaction, and Identity |editor=P.

===Markedness model===
{{main|Markedness model}}
The Markedness Model, developed by [[Carol Myers-Scotton]], is one of the more complete theories of code-switching motivations. It posits that language users are [[Rationality|rational]] and choose to speak a language that clearly marks their rights and obligations, relative to other speakers, in the conversation and its setting.&lt;ref name="CMS1993"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Myers-Scotton |first=Carol |year=1993 |title=Social Motivations for Codeswitching: Evidence from Africa |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqD-y_IF3SwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; When there is no clear, [[markedness|unmarked]] language choice, speakers practice code-switching to explore possible language choices. Many sociolinguists, however, object to the Markedness Model’s postulation that language-choice is entirely rational.&lt;ref name="Auer1998"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Auer |first=Peter |year=1998 |title=Code-Switching in Conversation |location=London |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woolard2004"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woolard |first=Kathryn |authorlink=Kathryn Woolard |year=2004 |chapter=Codeswitching |editor=A. Duranti |title=A Companion to Linguistic Anthropology |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell |pages=73–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequential analysis===
Scholars of conversation analysis such as Peter Auer and [[Li Wei (linguist)|Li Wei]] argue that the social motivation behind code-switching lies in the way code-switching is structured and managed in conversational interaction; in other words, the question of why code-switching occurs cannot be answered without first addressing the question of how it occurs. Using conversation analysis (CA), these scholars focus their attention on the sequential implications of code-switching. That is, whatever language a speaker chooses to use for a conversational turn, or part of a turn, impacts the subsequent choices of language by the speaker as well as the hearer. Rather than focusing on the social values inherent in the languages the speaker chooses ("brought-along meaning"), the analysis concentrates on the meaning that the act of code-switching itself creates ("brought-about meaning").&lt;ref name="Li1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auer1998"/&gt;

===Communication accommodation theory===
The [[communication accommodation theory]] (CAT), developed by [[Howard Giles]], professor of communication at the University of California, Santa Barbara, seeks to explain the cognitive reasons for code-switching, and other changes in speech, as a person either emphasizes or minimizes the social differences between himself and the other person(s) in conversation.  Giles posits that when speakers seek approval in a social situation they are likely to converge their speech with that of the other speaker.  This can include, but is not limited to, the language of choice, accent, dialect, and para-linguistic features used in the conversation. In contrast to convergence, speakers might also engage in divergent speech, in which an individual person emphasizes the social distance between himself and other speakers by using speech with linguistic features characteristic of his own group.

===Diglossia===
{{Main|Diglossia}}

In a diglossic situation, some topics and situations are better suited to the use of one language over another. [[Joshua Fishman]] proposes a domain-specific code-switching model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fishman |first=Joshua |year=1967 |title=Bilingualism with and without diglossia; Diglossia with and without bilingualism |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=23 |pages=29–38 |issue=2 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1967.tb00573.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; (later refined by Blom and [[John J.

==Types of switching==
Scholars use different names for various types of code-switching.

*'''Intersentential switching''' occurs ''outside'' the sentence or the clause level (i.e. at sentence or clause boundaries).&lt;ref name=LiWei&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bilingualism Reader |editor=Li Wei |place=London |publisher=Routledge |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called '''"extrasentential" switching'''.&lt;ref name=Types&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Myers-Scotton |first=Carol |year=1989 |title=Codeswitching with English: types of switching, types of communities |journal=World Englishes |volume=8 |pages=333–346 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-971X.1989.tb00673.x |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Assyrian-English switching one could say, "''Ani wideili.'' What happened?" ("''Those, I did them.'' What happened?").&lt;ref name=McClure&gt;McClure, Erica (2001). "[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=t9CFyeFKDy0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=%22Oral+and+Written+Assyrian-English+Code-switching%22&amp;ots=uP5epXseQl&amp;sig=wfbIw2qnh_1BO20E_xzW5bwvkoY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Oral%20and%20Written%20Assyrian-English%20Code-switching%22&amp;f=false Oral and Written Assyrian-English Code-switching]." In Rodolfo Jacobson. ''Codeswitching Worldwide II.'' Berlin, New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 2001. pg 166. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Intra-sentential switching''' occurs ''within'' a sentence or a clause.&lt;ref name=LiWei/&gt;&lt;ref name=Types/&gt; In Spanish-English switching one could say, "''La onda'' is to fight ''y jambar.''" ("''The latest fad'' is to fight ''and steal.''")&lt;ref name=Woolford&gt;Woolford, Ellen. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4178342 Bilingual Code-Switching and Syntactic Theory]." Linguistic Inquiry. Vol. 14. Cambridge: MIT, 1983. 520-36. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Tag-switching''' is the switching of either a tag phrase or a [[word]], or both, from one language to another, (common in ''intra-sentential switches'').&lt;ref name=LiWei/&gt; In Spanish-English switching one could say, "''Él es de México y así los criaron a ellos,'' you know." ("''He's from Mexico, and they raise them like that,'' you know.")&lt;ref name="Winford"&gt;Winford, Donald. "Code Switching: Linguistic Aspects." An Introduction to Contact Linguistics. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub., 2003. 126-167. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Intra-word switching''' occurs ''within'' a word itself, such as at a [[morpheme]] boundary.&lt;ref name=Types/&gt; In [[Shona language|Shona]]-English switching one could say, "''But ma''-day-s ''a-no a-ya ha-ndi-si ku-mu-on-a.''  ("''But these'' days ''I don't see him much.''") Here the English plural morpheme -''s'' appears alongside the Shona prefix ''ma''-, which also marks plurality.&lt;ref name=Winford/&gt;

Most code-switching studies primarily focus on intra-sentential switching, as it creates many hybrid grammar structures that require explanation. The other types involve utterances that simply follow the grammar of one language or the other.  Intra-sentential switching can be alternational or insertional.  In alternational code-switching, a new grammar emerges that is a combination of the grammars of the two languages involved. Insertional code-switching involves "the insertion of elements from one language into the morphosyntactic frame of the other."&lt;ref name=Winford/&gt;

== Reasons ==
There are several reasons to switch codes in a single conversation.
* '''A particular topic:''' People generally switch codes during discourse about a particular topic, since it requires specific language; varieties related to a particular topic may be better able to convey or communicate issues surrounding it. 
* '''Quoting someone:''' People have to switch codes while quoting another person.
* '''Solidarity and gratitude:''' While expressing gratitude or solidarity, people may speak in ways that express these feelings.
* '''Clarification:''' Speakers may alter their speech when listeners have trouble understanding how they communicated a thought or idea before. Same can be said for speakers who do not know of (or don't remember) the appropriate words to use in their native language.
* '''Group identity:''' People may alter their language to express group identification. This can happen, for example, when introducing members of a particular group to others.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2014).  Covert bilingualism and symbolic competence: Analytical reflections on negotiating insider/outsider positionality in Swedish speech situations. ''Applied Linguistics, 35''(1), 63-81.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''To soften or strengthen command:''' While asking someone to do something, code switching works to mark emphasis or provide inspiration. 
* '''Lexical need:''' People often use some technical terms or words written in another language. In that case, if people try to translate those words, that might distort the exact meaning and value of the word or term. In this case, code switching occurs to maintain the exact meaning of the word.

==Grammatical theories==
{{criticism section|section|date=June 2016}}
In studying the syntactic and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] patterns of language alternation, linguists have postulated specific [[Grammar|grammatical]] rules and specific syntactic boundaries for where code-switching might occur.

===Poplack's model===

[[Shana Poplack]]'s model of code-switching is the best known theory of the underlying grammar of code-switching.&lt;ref name="Winford" /&gt; In this model, code-switching is subject to two constraints. The ''free-morpheme constraint'' stipulates that code-switching cannot occur between a lexical stem and bound morphemes. Essentially, this constraint distinguishes code-switching from borrowing. Generally, borrowing occurs in the lexicon, while code-switching occurs at either the syntax level or the utterance-construction level.&lt;ref name="Gumperz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Poplack 1984 99–136"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muysken 1995 177–98"/&gt; The ''equivalence constraint'' predicts that switches occur only at points where the surface structures of the languages coincide, or between sentence elements that are normally ordered in the same way by each individual grammar.&lt;ref name="Winford" /&gt; For example, the sentence: "I like you ''porque eres simpático''" ("I like you ''because you are nice''") is allowed because it obeys the syntactic rules of both Spanish and English.&lt;ref name="SanPop1981"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sankoff |first=David |author2=Shana Poplack |year=1981 |title=A formal grammar for code-switching |journal=Papers in Linguistics |volume=14 |pages=3–45 |issue=1–4 |doi=10.1080/08351818109370523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases like the noun phrases ''the casa white'' and ''the blanca house'' are ruled out because the combinations are ungrammatical in at least one of the languages involved. Spanish noun phrases are made up of determiners, then nouns, then adjectives, while the adjectives come before the nouns in English noun phrases. ''The casa white'' is ruled out by the equivalence constraint because it does not obey the syntactic rules of English, and ''the blanca house'' is ruled out because it does not follow the syntactic rules of Spanish.&lt;ref name="Winford" /&gt;

Critics cite weaknesses of Sankoff and Poplack's model. The free-morpheme and equivalence constraints are insufficiently restrictive, meaning there are numerous exceptions that occur. For example, the free morpheme constraint does not account for why switching is impossible between certain free morphemes. The sentence: "The students had ''visto la película italiana''" ("The students had ''seen the Italian movie''") does not occur in Spanish-English code-switching, yet the free-morpheme constraint would seem to posit that it can.&lt;ref name="Belazi"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Belazi |first=Heidi |author2=Edward Rubin |author3=Almeida Jacqueline Toribio  |year=1994 |title=Code switching and X-Bar theory: The functional head constraint |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |volume=25 |pages=221–37 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalence constraint would also rule out switches that occur commonly in languages, as when Hindi postpositional phrases are switched with English prepositional phrases like in the sentence:  "John gave a book ''ek larakii ko''" ("John gave a book ''to a girl''"). The phrase ''ek larakii ko'' is literally translated as ''a girl to,'' making it ungrammatical in English, and yet this is a sentence that occurs in English-Hindi code-switching despite the requirements of the equivalence constraint.&lt;ref name="Winford" /&gt; The Sankoff and Poplack model only identifies points at which switching is blocked, as opposed to explaining which [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] can be switched and why.&lt;ref name="Winford" /&gt;

===Matrix language-frame model===
{{technical|section|date=November 2013}}
[[Carol Myers-Scotton]]'s Matrix Language-Frame (MLF) model is the dominant model of insertional code-switching.&lt;ref name="Winford" /&gt; The MLF model posits that there is a '''Matrix Language''' (ML) and an '''Embedded Language''' (EL). In this case, elements of the Embedded Language are inserted into the morphosyntactic frame of the Matrix Language. The hypotheses are as follows (Myers-Scotton 1993b: 7):

The Matrix Language Hypothesis states that those grammatical procedures in the central structure in the language production system which account for the surface structure of the Matrix Language + Embedded Language [[constituent (linguistics)]] are only Matrix Language–based procedures. Further, the hypothesis is intended to imply that frame-building precedes content [[morpheme]] insertion. A Matrix Language can be the first language of the speaker or the language in which the morphemes or words are more frequently used in speech, so the dominant language is the Matrix Language and the other is the Embedded Language. A '''Matrix Language island''' is a constituent composed entirely of Matrix Language morphemes.&lt;ref&gt;Scotton, Carol. Duelling languages: grammatical structure in codeswitching. Oxford, Eng.: Clarendon Press ;, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the '''Blocking Hypothesis''', in Matrix Language + Embedded Language constituents, a blocking filter blocks any Embedded Language content morpheme which is not congruent with the Matrix Language with respect to three levels of abstraction regarding subcategorization. "Congruence" is used in the sense that two entities, linguistic categories in this case, are congruent if they correspond in respect of relevant qualities.

The three levels of abstraction are:
* Even if the Embedded Language realizes a given grammatical category as a content morpheme, if it is realized as a system morpheme in the Matrix Language, the Matrix Language blocks the occurrence of the Embedded Language content morpheme. (A content morpheme is often called an "open-class" morpheme, because they belong to categories that are open to the invention of arbitrary new items. They can be made-up words like "smurf", "nuke", "byte", etc. and can be nouns, verbs, adjectives, and some prepositions. A system morpheme, e.g. function words and inflections, expresses the relation between content morphemes and does not assign or receive thematic roles.)
* The Matrix Language also blocks an Embedded Language content morpheme in these constituents if it is not congruent with a Matrix Language content morpheme counterpart in terms of [[theta role]] assignment. 
*Congruence between Embedded Language content morphemes and Matrix Language content morphemes is realized in terms of their discourse or [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] functions.

;Examples
# Hindi/English
#* life ko face kiijiye with himmat and faith in apane aap. (Code-switching) 
#* "Face life with courage and faith in self." (Translation) 
# Swahili/English
#* hata wengine nasikia washawekwa cell. (Code-switching) 
#* "Even others I heard were put [in] cells." (Translation)

We see that example 1 is consistent with the Blocking Hypothesis and the system content morpheme criteria, so the prediction is that the Hindi equivalents are also content morphemes. Sometimes non-congruence between counterparts in the Matrix Language and Embedded Language can be circumvented by accessing bare forms. "Cell" is a bare form and so the thematic role of "cell" is assigned by the verb ''-wek-'' 'put in/on'; this means that the verb is a content morpheme.

The '''Embedded Language Island Trigger Hypothesis''' states that when an Embedded Language morpheme appears which is not permitted under either the Matrix Language Hypothesis or Blocking Hypothesis, it triggers the inhibition of all Matrix Language accessing procedures and completes the current constituent as an Embedded Language island. Embedded Language islands consist only of Embedded Language morphemes and are well-formed by Embedded Language grammar, but they are inserted in the Matrix Language frame. Therefore, Embedded Language islands are under the constraint of Matrix Language grammar.

;Examples
# Swahili/English
#* *Sikuona your barau ambayo uliipoteza. (Code-switching ungrammatical) 
#* "I didn't see your letter which you lost." (Translation)
# Swahili/English 
#* *Nikamwambia anipe ruhusa niende ni-ka-check for wewe. (Code-switching, ungrammatical) 
#* "And I told him he should give me permission so that I go and check for you." (Translation)
#* Nikamwambia anipe ruhusa niende ni-ka-check for you. (Code-switching, grammatical)

Example 1 is ungrammatical (indicated by the leading asterisk) because "your" is accessed, so the Embedded Language Island Trigger Hypothesis predicts that it must be followed by an English head (e.g., "your letter") as an Embedded Language island. The reason is that possessive adjectives are system morphemes. We see the same thing happen in example 2, which is therefore ungrammatical. However, the correct way to finish the sentence is not "for wewe", switching back to Swahili; rather, it should end with "for you", which would be an Embedded Language island.

The '''Embedded Language Implicational Hierarchy Hypothesis''' can be stated as two sub-hypotheses: 
# The farther a constituent is from the main arguments of the sentence, the freer it is to appear as an Embedded Language island. 
# The more formulaic in structure a constituent is, the more likely it is to appear as an Embedded Language island. Stated more strongly, choice of any part of an idiomatic expression will result in an Embedded Language island.&lt;ref name="Winford" /&gt;

The '''Implication Hierarchy of Embedded Language Islands''':
# Formulaic expressions and [[idioms]] (especially prepositional phrases expressing time and manner, but also as verb phrase complements)
# Other time and manner expressions
# [[Quantifier (linguistics)|Quantifier]] expressions
# Non-quantifier, non-time [[noun phrase]]s as [[verb phrase]] complements
# [[Agent (grammar)|Agent]] Noun phrases
# [[Theme (linguistics)|Theme]] role and case assigners, i.e. main finite verbs (with full [[inflections]])

;Examples
# Wolof/French
#* Le matin de bonne heure ngay joge Medina pour dem juilli. Suba tee nga fa war a joge. (Code-switching)
#* "Early in the morning you leave Medina to go to pray. Early in the morning you should leave then." (Translation)
# Swahili/English
#* Ulikuwa ukiongea a lot of nonsense. (Code-switching)
#* "You were talking a lot of nonsense." (Translation)

We see example 1 work because the French Embedded Language island ''Le matin de bonne heure'', "early in the morning", is a time expression. (Also, it is repeated in Wolof in the second sentence.) In example 2, we see the quantifier ''a lot of'' is a predicted Embedded Language island. Here we see an objective complement of a finite verb begin with the quantifier.

===Constraint-free===
[[Jeff MacSwan]] has posited a ''constraint-free approach'' to analyzing code-switching. This approach views explicit reference to code-switching in grammatical analysis as [[tautology (logic)|tautological]], and seeks to explain specific instances of grammaticality in terms of the unique contributions of the grammatical properties of the languages involved. MacSwan characterizes the approach with the refrain, "Nothing constrains code-switching apart from the requirements of the mixed grammars."&lt;ref name=Jeff&gt;MacSwan, Jeff (2000). "The architecture of the bilingual language faculty: Evidence from codeswitching". Bilingualism: Language and Cognition 3 (1): 37–54.&lt;/ref&gt; The approach focuses on the repudiation of any rule or principle which explicitly refers to code-switching itself.&lt;ref name=MacSwan&gt;MacSwan, Jeff (2013). "Code-switching and grammatical theory". In T. Bhatia and W. Ritchie. Handbook of Multilingualism (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach does not recognize or accept terms such as "matrix language", "embedded language", or "language frame", which are typical in constraint-based approaches such as the MLF Model.

Rather than posit constraints specific to language alternation, as in traditional work in the field, MacSwan advocates that mixed utterances be analyzed with a focus on the specific and unique linguistic contributions of each language found in a mixed utterance.  Because these analyses draw on the full range of linguistic theory, and each data set presents its own unique challenges, a much broader understanding of linguistics is generally needed to understand and participate in this style of codeswitching research.

For example, Cantone and MacSwan (2009)&lt;ref name=Cantone&gt;{{cite book| last1=Cantone| first1=K. F.| last2=MacSwan| first2=J. |date=2009 |chapter= The syntax of DP-internal codeswitching |pages= 243–278 |editor1-last=Isurin |editor1-first=L. |editor1-link= |editor2-last=Winford |editor2-first=D. |editor2-link= |editor3-last=de Bot |editor3-first=K. |editor3-link= |title=Multidisciplinary Approaches to Codeswitching |location=Amsterdam |publisher=John Benjamins}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed word order differences for nouns and adjectives in Italian-German codeswitching using a typological theory of Cinque that had been independently proposed in the syntax literature; their account derives the word order facts of Italian-German codeswitching from underlying differences between the two languages, according to Cinque's theory.{{citation needed | reason= Who is Cinque? What theory? I'm sure it's mentioned in the source cited, but it seems important enough here for a direct link (as 'cited in'), even just copying their ref and adding any online version available.| date= June 2016 }}

===Controversies===
Much remains to be done before a more complete understanding of code-switching phenomena is achieved. Linguists continue to debate apparent counter-examples to proposed code-switching theories and constraints.&lt;ref name=Bokamba /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winford" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bhatt&gt;{{cite book| last=Bhatt |first=Rakesh M. |date=1995 |chapter=Code-switching and the functional head constraint| editor=Janet Fuller |display-editors=etal |title=Proceedings of the Eleventh Eastern States Conference on Linguistics |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics |pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Closed-class Constraint'', developed by [[Aravind Joshi]], posits that [[closed class]] items (pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, etc.) cannot be switched.&lt;ref name=Joshi&gt;{{cite book| last=Joshi |first=Aravind |date=1985 |chapter=How much context-sensitivity is necessary for assigning structural descriptions: Tree adjoining grammars |editor1-last=Dowty |editor1-first=D. |editor1-link=David Dowty |editor2-last=Karttunen |editor2-first=L. |editor2-link=Lauri Karttunen |editor3-last=Zwicky |editor3-first=A. |editor3-link=Arnold Zwicky |title=Natural Language Parsing |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Functional Head Constraint'' developed by Belazi et al. holds that code-switching cannot occur between a [[Function word|functional]] [[Head (linguistics)|head]] (a [[complementizer]], a [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiner]], an [[inflection]], etc.) and its complement (sentence, noun-phrase, verb-phrase).&lt;ref name="Belazi" /&gt; These constraints, among others like the Matrix Language-Frame model, are controversial among linguists positing alternative theories, as they are seen to claim universality and make general predictions based upon specific presumptions about the nature of syntax.&lt;ref name="Bokamba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhatt" /&gt;

Myers-Scotton and MacSwan debated the relative merits of their approaches in a series of exchanges published in 2005 in ''[[Bilingualism: Language and Cognition]]'', issues 8(1) and 8(2).

==Examples==
In this section, segments that are switched from the primary language of the conversation are shown in red.

===Spanish and English===
Researcher [[Ana Celia Zentella]] offers this example from her work with Puerto Rican Spanish-English bilingual speakers in New York City.&lt;ref name="Zentella"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zentella |first=Ana Celia |year=1997 |title=Growing Up Bilingual |location=Malden, MA |publisher=Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, {{Smallcaps|Marta}} and her younger sister, {{Smallcaps|Lolita}}, speak Spanish and English with {{Smallcaps|Zentella}} outside of their apartment building.
:{{Smallcaps|Lolita}}: Oh, I could stay with Ana?
:{{Smallcaps|Marta}}: — but you could ask &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;''papi''&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;''mami''&lt;/span&gt; to see if you could come down.
:{{Smallcaps|Lolita}}: OK.
:{{Smallcaps|Marta}}: Ana, if I leave her here would you send her upstairs when you leave?
:{{Smallcaps|Zentella}}: I’ll tell you exactly when I have to leave, at ten o’clock. &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;''Y son las nueve y cuarto.''&lt;/span&gt; ("And it’s nine fifteen.")
:{{Smallcaps|Marta}}: Lolita, &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;''te voy a dejar con Ana.''&lt;/span&gt; ("I’m going to leave you with Ana.") Thank you, Ana.

Zentella explains that the children of the predominantly Puerto Rican neighbourhood speak both English and Spanish: "Within the children’s network, English predominated, but code-switching from English to Spanish occurred once every three minutes, on average."&lt;ref name="Zentella"/&gt;

===French and Tamil===
This example of switching from [[French language|French]] to [[Tamil language|Tamil]] comes from [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] Sonia Das's work with immigrants from [[Jaffna]], [[Sri Lanka]], to [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name="Das"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Das |first=Sonia |title=Rewriting the past and reimagining the future: The social life of a Tamil heritage language industry |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=774–789 |year=2011 |doi=10.1111/j.1548-1425.2011.01336.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Non-standard French as given in the original; please do not correct it to standard French. --&gt;
:{{Smallcaps|Selvamani}}: {{As written|Parce que n’importe quand quand j’enregistre ma voix ça l’{{sic|aire|hide=yes}} d’un garçon.}} ([in French] "Because whenever I record my voice I sound like a guy.")
::::Alors, {{As written|TSÉ, je me {{sic|ferrai|hide=yes}} pas poigné}}  ("So, you know, I’m not going to be had.")
:[laughter]
:{{Smallcaps|Selvamani}}: &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;''ennatā, ennatā, enna romba ciritā?''&lt;/span&gt; ([in Tamil] "What, what, what's so funny?")
::::Alors, qu’est-ce que je disais? ([in French] "So, what was I saying?")

{{Smallcaps|Selvamani}}, who moved from Sri Lanka to Quebec as a child and now identifies as [[Québécois (word)|Québécois]], speaks to Das in French. When Selvamani's sister, Mala, laughs, {{Smallcaps|Selvamani}} switches to Tamil to ask Mala why she is laughing. After this aside, {{Smallcaps|Selvamani}} continues to speak in French. {{Smallcaps|Selvamani}} also uses the word ''tsé'' ("you know", contraction of ''tu sais'') and the expression ''je me {{sic|ferrai|hide=yes}} pas poigné'' ("I will not be handled"), which are not standard French but are typical of the working-class Montreal dialect [[Joual]].&lt;ref name="Das" /&gt;

===Hopi and Tewa===
Researcher [[Paul Kroskrity]] offers the following example of code-switching by {{Smallcaps|three elder [[Arizona Tewa]] men}}, who are trilingual in [[Tewa language|Tewa]], [[Hopi language|Hopi]], and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kroskrity |first=Paul V |year=2000 |chapter=Language ideologies in the expression and representation of Arizona Tewa identity |editor=P. V. Kroskrity |title=Regimes of Language: Ideologies, Polities, and Identities |pages=329–59 |location=Santa Fe, New Mexico |publisher=[[School of American Research Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are discussing the selection of a site for a new high school in the eastern [[Hopi Reservation]]:
:{{Smallcaps|Speaker A}}: &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;''Tututqaykit qanaanawakna.''&lt;/span&gt; ([in Hopi] "Schools were not wanted.")
:{{Smallcaps|Speaker B}}: Wédít’ókánk’egena’adi imbí akhonidi. ([in Tewa] "They didn’t want a school on their land.")
:{{Smallcaps|Speaker C}}: Naembí eeyae nąeląemo díbít’ó’ámmí kąayį’į wédimu::di. ([in Tewa] "It’s better if our children go to school right here, rather than far away.")

In their two-hour conversation, the {{Smallcaps|three men}} primarily speak Tewa; however, when {{Smallcaps|Speaker A}} addresses the Hopi Reservation as a whole, he code-switches to Hopi. His speaking Hopi when talking of Hopi-related matters is a conversational norm in the Arizona Tewa speech community. Kroskrity reports that these Arizona Tewa men, who [[culturally]] identify themselves as Hopi ''and'' Tewa, use the different languages to linguistically construct and maintain their discrete ethnic identities.

'''''Coffee, Tea or Me?''''' is a book of purported memoirs by the fictitious [[Flight attendant|stewardesses]] Trudy Baker and Rachel Jones, written by the initially uncredited [[Donald Bain (writer)|Donald Bain]] and first published in 1967. The book depicts the anecdotal lives of two lusty young stewardesses, and was originally presented as factual.

==Publishing history==
[[Donald Bain (writer)|Donald Bain]] revealed in his 2002 memoir ''Every Midget Has an Uncle Sam Costume: Writing for a Living'' that he wrote ''Coffee, Tea or Me?'' and three sequels while employed as a New York City-based [[American Airlines]] [[public relations]] person.&lt;ref name=sharkey&gt;{{cite web | url = http://joesharkeyat.blogspot.com/2010/03/fly-girls-and-some-myths-about.html | authorlink = Joe Sharkey | first= Joe | last = Sharkey | date= March 27, 2010 | title = 'Fly Girls' and Some Myths About 'Stewardesses' | work = Joe Sharkey (official site) | accessdate = May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher hired two [[Eastern Airlines]] stewardesses to pose as the authors for book tours and television appearances.&lt;ref name=sharkey /&gt; As ''[[The New York Times]]'' columnist [[Joe Sharkey]] described in 2010,
{{quote|An editor at a publishing house introduced him to two Eastern Airlines stewardesses who thought they together might be able to write a book about their escapades. The editor thought Don might want to be the ghostwriter for the two women. But when Don sat down with them, they didn't have much to offer besides a few anecdotes. "I realized they didn't have enough to sustain a book, and I was going to have to use an awful lot of my own imagination," he told me then. Nevertheless, he was inspired by the idea. So he created a "memoir" out of whole cloth. The book shot onto the best-seller list, and the two stewardesses were delighted to go on the road to publicize it as the authors -- even though their real names were not on the cover. Bedazzled by fame, "one of them legally changed her real name to the one I had given her on the book," Bain told me.&lt;ref name=sharkey /&gt;}}

Bain himself said, "I wrote it in 1966 while working in public relations for American Airlines, and it went on to spawn an entire genre of wacky comedies, including three direct sequels. All in all, the four books sold more than five million copies worldwide, and became my annuity for almost 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Donald Bain (writer) | first = Donald | last= Bain | url  = http://www.donaldbain.com/the__coffee__tea_or_me___series_2821.htm | title = The "Coffee, Tea or Me?" Series | publisher = Donald Bain (official site) | accessdate= May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bartholomew House Ltd., a division of [[Bartell Media Corporation]], published a hardcover edition in October 1967,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} with a second printing in December, and a third in January 1968.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} [[Bantam Books]], at that time a subsidiary of [[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]], released a paperback edition in November 1968,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} and had reached its tenth printing by January 1969.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Bain was uncredited other than in a dedication, until the 2003 edition, in which he was credited beneath the Baker and Jones byline as "with Donald Bain."&lt;ref name=sharkey /&gt;

The [[Penguin Group]], the publisher as of the 21st century, describes the book as "adult fiction".&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Search/QuickSearchProc/1,,Author_1000060959,00.html The Penguin Group at Penguin.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and content==
Written in the first person voice of Trudy Baker, with Bain's name appearing as a dedication between the index of chapters and the foreword, the book describes a kind of glamorous lifestyle from the stewardess' point of view, working for two years for an unnamed American carrier out of a New York crewbase during the golden age of airline travel.

It is written to emphasize the sexy parts of the job, although difficult experiences are also recounted, and reflects the shifts in society and culture then underway.  It also contains content that could in later decades be deemed sexist, and dated descriptions of homosexuality; chapter X is titled "They Looked So Normal".  In chapter XIV, the attendants list one of the types of passengers that could be denied boarding rights&amp;nbsp;— "most recently, men wearing earrings." Illustrations by men's-magazine cartoonist [[Bill Wenzel]] depict the flight attendants and female passengers as buxom sexpots.

The book contains period references to television shows such as ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' and lists of celebrities the authors claim to have carried on their flights, as well as an incidental description of the airline introducing [[Boeing 727]] service. Other equipment mentioned includes the [[Boeing 707]] and the smaller [[BAC One-Eleven|BAC 111]]. People's names are fictitious, excepting the famous, and there is no way to gauge the accuracy of any of the accounts.

The two most likely candidates for which airline the stewardesses supposedly worked for are [[American Airlines]] and [[Braniff International Airways]], the only carriers who purchased BAC-111s to supplement fleets of Boeing 707s and 727s in the mid-1960s time frame of the novel.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} [[Mohawk Airlines]], a northeast regional line, ordered four BAC-111s but never operated the larger Boeings in its fleet, nor did its regions of service match those described in the book.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Sequels and spinoffs==
Capitalizing on the success of the publication, Bain wrote three sequels: ''The Coffee Tea or Me Girls' Round-the-World Diary'' (1969), ''The Coffee Tea or Me Girls Lay It on the Line'' (1972) and ''The Coffee Tea or Me Girls Get Away from It All'' (1974). A TV film of the same title, loosely based on ''[[Coffee, Tea or Me? (film)|Coffee, Tea or Me?]]'' was made in 1973.&lt;ref name="1973movie"&gt;(1 October 1973). [http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1973/1973-10-01-BC.pdf The new shows are no-shows in the first week's ratings], ''Broadcasting'' (the movie was the 6th most watched primetime show of the week according to the Nielsen ratings, with a 25.7 rating and 43 share)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Jaggerz]]' #2 hit "[[The Rapper]]" from 1970 contains the line "come up to my place '''for some coffee, or tea, or me'''." The phrase is also mentioned in the 1978 [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]] song "[[Women in Uniform]]" and the 1988 film [[Working Girl]].

The book appears briefly in the 1997 Disney film ''[[George of the Jungle (film)|George of the Jungle]]'' where it is described as a good source of [[Courtship display|courtship behaviour]].

The book's title lent itself to a 2002 documentary of the same name, which interviewed air hostesses who worked in the New Zealand airline industry in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/coffee-tea-or-me-2002 NZ On Screen - Coffee, Tea or Me?]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Coronation of the Virgin''''' is a painting by [[Diego Velázquez]] of the [[Coronation of the Virgin|Holy Trinity crowning the Blessed Virgin Mary]], a theme in [[Marian art]]. It is now at the [[Museo del Prado]].

It was probably commissioned for the oratory of the court of [[Elisabeth of France (1602–1644)|Elisabeth of France]], queen consort to [[Philip IV of Spain]], in the [[Real Alcázar of Madrid]]. There it joined others on [[Virgin Mary|Marian]] religious festivities by the [[Naples]] painter [[Andrea Vaccaro]] which had been brought to Madrid by cardinal [[Gaspar de Borja y Velasco]]. The model for Mary in the work may be the same model as the artist used for the ''[[Rokeby Venus]]''.

== Description ==
Velázquez's coronation of the Virgin is exceptional for being a rare religious work by an artist better known for his portraits, and for the air of naturalness and simplicity not found in works by other Baroque religious painters. Its composition is based on an inverted triangle, giving a sense of great equilibrium and harmonious lines and reminiscent (both in its colour and form) of a heart. The main figure is the Virgin Mary, with a modest, reverential, and emotional expression, lowered eyes, a straight nose and curved lips. The sense that the inverted triangle is meant to refer to a heart is reinforced and the viewer's piety invoked by Mary pointing to her own heart.

To the viewer's right is God the Father, represented as a dignified old man, whilst to the left is the long-haired figure of Jesus Christ - together they hold Mary's crown above her head. In the centre the [[Holy Spirit]] is represented in the form of a white dove. The two figures' heads and the dove are all level, on the line of the triangle's base, representing their equality within the [[Holy Trinity]]. Also notable are the [[cherub]]s round the Virgin at the base of the painting - their pictorial quality rivals that of [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]], famous for his cherub-themed works.

The colours Velázquez uses are blues and violets. He also used [[carmine]]s (especially Venetian carmine) instead of traditional reds, following the advice of his tutor Pacheco as written down in his book ''Arte de la Pintura'', despite Velázquez already being an acclaimed artist and well beyond his student years by the time of producing this painting.

'''Critical understanding''' is a term used commonly in education to define a mode of thinking, described as, ‘an essential tool for participating in democratic processes, at whatever level.’&lt;ref name="Dodds"&gt;Dodds, H. (2009). Addressing the ‘why’ in English Teaching Online, Summer (1)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a defensible position reached through the examination of ideas, issues or sources. It is achieved through reflecting upon, analysing and evaluating different ideas and positions, and is demonstrated through an ability to express informed responses and independent thought.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;BBC Bitesize, http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/art/aos/ao42.shtml [accessed Jun 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Critical understanding develops through analytical and independent thought and is considered an increasingly important element of the education process as students progress to [[higher education|higher]] and [[further education]].&lt;ref name="Barnett"&gt;Barnett, R. (1997). Higher Education: A Critical Business. Bristol: Open University Press/Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; However it is not an easy concept to communicate for it is not a passive thing we do; it is about active engagement.&lt;ref name="Barton"&gt;Barton, G. (2009). ‘A whiff of controversy’ in English Teaching Online, Summer (1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
Critical understanding is a cerebral mode of comprehension, it is a way of thinking, and thus is not dependent upon external expression. Yet it requires external manifestation in order to be communicated. The expression of critical understanding can take various forms including formal or informal speech, academic writing, creative prose or poetry or visual outcomes. It can take different forms in different cultures and this needs to be taken into consideration when assessing critical results.&lt;ref name="Charnock"&gt;Charnock, K. (2010) The right to reticence. Teaching in Higher Education 15(5). 543-552&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "critical" in this context is not meant in a negative sense; rather it outlines a process of thinking. Critical understanding is used to define the process of formulating and understanding a complex problem or difficult set of ideas. In a general sense, it is, ‘a consequence of men’s [sic] beginning to reflect about their own capacity for reflection, about the world, about their position in the world.’&lt;ref name="Freire"&gt;Freire, P. (1996). Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Translated by Myra Bergman Ramos. London: Penguin. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
The notion of critical understanding is closely related to the concept of [[Critical Thinking]], described as, ‘reasonable reflective thinking focused on deciding what to believe or do.’&lt;ref name="Ennis"&gt;Ennis, R.H, ‘Critical Thinking Assessment’ in Fasko, Critical Thinking and Reasoning: Current Research, Theory, and Practice (2003). {{ISBN|978-1-57273-460-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical thinking has also been described as, ‘thinking about thinking’,&lt;ref name="Mathew"&gt;Mathew, A. (2004). Smart Thinking: Skills for Critical Understanding and Writing. 2nd edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 5&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in relation to John Dewey’s work on ‘the problem of training thought’.&lt;ref name="Dewey"&gt;Dewey, J. (1997). How We Think. New York: Dover Publications&lt;/ref&gt; Critical understanding has its roots in the notion of [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]], the idea of multiple approaches, methods and interpretations in which dialogue plays an important role.&lt;ref name="BoothWanye"&gt;Booth, Wanye, C. (1979). Critical Understanding. Chicago and London: Chicago University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In a pedagogical sense it is closely linked to the theory of Education for Critical Consciousness, outlined by [[Paulo Freire]], Brazilian educator and critical theorist, who wrote, ‘Only dialogue, which requires critical thinking, is also capable of generating critical thinking. Without dialogue there is no communication, and without communication there can be no true education.’&lt;ref name="Freire_a"&gt;Freire, P. (2007) Education for Critical Consciousness. Translated and edited by Myra Bergman Ramos. London: Continuum. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical Understanding and Secondary Education (UK)==
In [[Secondary education]] in the UK, critical understanding can be used as an umbrella term to define thinking skills which encourage children to, ‘have enquiring minds and think for themselves to process information, reason, question and evaluate’&lt;ref name="TheDepartment"&gt;The Department of Education. ‘The Aims of the National Curriculum’. updated 28 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Students’ ability to apply critical thought to a given task is important across the curriculum. Although not always explicitly labelled students are encouraged to develop thinking skills that develop from simple identification to successful evaluation.&lt;ref name="Bloom"&gt;Bloom, B. S., Engelhart, M. D., Furst, E. J., Hill, W. H., &amp; Krathwohl, D. R. (1956). Taxonomy of educational objectives: the classification of educational goals; Handbook I: Cognitive Domain New York, Longmans, Green, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; This follows [[Bloom's Taxonomy]], outlined in the standard text, Taxonomy of educational objectives: the classification of educational goals.&lt;ref name="Bloom" /&gt; This taxonomy is a classification of learning objectives aimed to motivate educators to develop teaching and learning styles that will develop students’ evaluative skills and critical understanding.

==Critical Understanding in Art and Design (UK)==
In [[Art and Design]], the term Critical Understanding is explicitly outlined. The [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)]] programme of study for [[Key Stage 3]] Art and Design states:

Critical Understanding
*a.	Exploring visual, tactile and other sensory qualities of their own and others’ work.
*b.	Engaging with ideas, images and artefacts, and identifying how values and meanings are conveyed.
*c.	Developing their own views and expressing reasoned judgements.
*d.	Analysing and reflecting on work from diverse contexts.&lt;ref name="TheDepartment_a"&gt;The Department of Education. ‘Art and Design: National Curriculum Program of study for key stage 3 and attainment target’. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
The term is also used on assessment grids for [[GCSE]] and GCE ([[General Certificate of Education]]) on the various exam boards including [[Edexcel]], AQA and OCR.&lt;ref&gt;AQA GCSE Art and Design, http://web.aqa.org.uk/qual/newgcses/art_dan_dra_mus/new/art_overview.php [accessed June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ocr"&gt;OCR GCSE Art and Design, http://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/type/gcse/amlw/art_design/ [accessed June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Edexcel]] [[GCSE]] assessment grid asks students to:
'Present a personal, informed and meaningful response demonstrating analytical and critical understanding realising intentions and, where appropriate, making connections between visual, written, oral or other elements.'&lt;ref name="edexcel"&gt;Edexcel GCSE Art and Design assessment grid from 2009, http://www.edexcel.com/migrationdocuments/GCSE%20New%20GCSE/GCSE2009-AssessmentGrid-456421.pdf [accessed June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
The revision website, [[BBC Bitesize]], aimed to support students through GCSE exams and coursework states:
'Critical understanding is about reflecting on your own work and that of other artists, designers and craftspeople. You need to be able to look closely at how artists and designers communicate their ideas, feelings and beliefs through their work. Your knowledge of the work of others should help you to develop your thinking, and this influence should be apparent in your own work.'&lt;ref name="bbc_a"&gt;BBC Bitesize, http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/art/aos/ao42.shtml [accessed June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical Understanding and the Internet==
The ability to think critically is an important skill when approaching the question of research and particularly the use of the Internet as a research tool in schools. Learning to use the Internet safely and successfully is considered by some to be a vital element of education in contemporary society.&lt;ref name="LivingstoneSonia"&gt;Livingstone, Sonia and Bober, M. (2004) Taking up opportunities? Children’s uses of the internet for education, communication and participation. E-Learning, 1 (3). 395-419. ISSN 1741-8887&lt;/ref&gt;
While the Internet has great learning possibilities it requires a critical approach. [[Kony 2012]]&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;Kony2012, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZjUSlsc9jQ [accessed June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent online response is an example of an Internet phenomenon requiring critical understanding.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;Cupaiuolo, C. (2012) ‘To Fully Engage with Kony2012 Students Need to Become Medai Producers’ in Spotlight on Digital Media and Learning. http://spotlight.macfound.org/blog/entry/to-fully-engage-with-kony-2012-students-need-to-be-media-producers [accessed June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to develop an independent and informed response a critical approach is required through which the issues, ideas and opinions presented can be questioned, analysed and reflected upon.

The '''Fibonacci Sequence''' is a British [[chamber music|chamber]] [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] cofounded by horn player [[Stephen Stirling (musician)|Stephen Stirling]] in 1984. Purposefully flexible, the ensemble is capable of [[concert program]]s ranging from solo up to a dectet featuring strings, winds, brass, piano, and [[percussion]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fibsonline.co.uk/repertoire/Sextet.php Our Repertoire]", ''FibSOnline.co.uk''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' in 2003, "no praise can be too high for the Fibonacci Sequence's polished and dashingly committed performances."

Pianist [[Kathron Sturrock]] is the artistic director. Other musicians include double bassist [[Duncan McTier]] and violist [[Yuko Inoue]].

[[Graham Fitkin]] composed a [[sextet]], ''Sinew'' (first performed 2009), for the ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;Maisel, Andrew (Sunday, October 04, 2009).

'''Finvenkismo''' ({{lang-en|'''Finvenkism'''}}) is an [[Language ideology|ideological]] current within the [[Esperanto movement]] dating back to [[L. L. Zamenhof]], the initiator of [[Esperanto]]. The name is derived from the concept of a ''fina venko'' (English: final victory) denoting the moment when Esperanto will be used as the predominant [[International auxiliary language|second language]] throughout the world. A finvenkist is thus someone who hopes for and/or works towards this "final victory" of Esperanto. According to some finvenkists, this "final victory" of Esperanto may help eradicate [[war]], [[chauvinism]] and [[Oppression|cultural oppression]].

Recently, some Esperantists have campaigned for the expression ''fina venko'' to be replaced with ''fina sukceso'' ("final success") because the former reminds some people of war due to its similarity to the German word ''[[endsieg]]''.

==Origin==
As [[Zamenhof]] created Esperanto with the goal of eventual use by everyone as a second language for international communication, finvenkismo has been around for as long as Esperanto itself. In the early days of the [[Esperanto movement]], essentially all Esperantists were also finvenkists. However, as the [[Esperanto community]] grew, so did the diversity of ideologies among Esperantists, some of whom began to challenge the merits of finvenkismo. Thus, one could be an Esperantist without being a finvenkist at all.

== Possible ways to achieve ==
During the 1910 [[World Esperanto Congress]], Zamenhof highlighted two ways that ''fina venko'' could be achieved: through diligent [[Autodidacticism|self-directed study]] of Esperanto by all people in the world, or by [[Curriculum|government action]] permitting or requiring Esperanto literacy to be taught in schools:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite speech|first=L. L.|last=Zamenhof|author-link=L. L.

It's easiest to believe that our goal will be achieved via the first way (self-study), because in that case, our current case, world governments will come to us with their blessing, as they are wont to do, only when all the work is already finished.

}}Among Esperantists, as Esperanto matured, the two ways began to be called ''{{Interlanguage link|desubismo|eo|desubismo|WD=}}'' ("from below -ism") and ''{{Interlanguage link|desuprismo|eo|desuprismo|WD=}}'' ("from above -ism") respectively.

==Raŭmismo and Civitanismo==
Since 1980, finvenkismo encountered criticism by so-called ''[[Raŭmismo|raŭmistoj]]''. This ideological current interprets the Esperanto community as a language [[diaspora]], whose members should not concentrate on the propagation of the language but rather on its cultivation. The term ''Raŭmismo'' comes from the [[Manifesto of Rauma]] signed by many participants of the [[International Youth Congress]] in the Finnish town [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]] in 1980.

Soon the word ''Raŭmismo'' acquired two different meanings: According to some, a ''Raŭmist'' is just someone who uses Esperanto without propagating it. According to the more ideological ''Raŭmismo'', a ''Raŭmist'' is someone who considers the Esperanto community a self chosen [[linguistic minority]] and supports attempts to get a state-like representation for this minority. This more ideological ''Raŭmismo'' is now often called ''Civitanismo'', because it is the official ideology of the ''[[Esperanta Civito]]'' (Esperanto Citizens' Community), an organisation which attempts to be such a state-like representation of the Esperanto diaspora.

Even though nowadays most Esperantists highly value cultivating the language—and the proportion of Esperanto-speakers who cultivate the language without propagating it is larger than ever—the ideological ''Raŭmismo'' (''Civitanismo'') has isolated itself somewhat within the Esperanto community because Civitanists are perceived to spend more energy on criticising the finvenkist Esperanto movement than on cultivating Esperanto.

In response to the criticisms from Raŭmists, the finvenkist Esperanto movement has produced the [[Prague Manifesto (Esperanto)|Prague Manifesto]], which attempts at showing the importance of finvenkismo in our modern society by emphasizing democratic communication, language rights, preservation of language diversity, and effective language education.

'''Forced assimilation''' is a process of [[cultural assimilation]] of religious or [[ethnic]] [[minority group]]s that is forced into an established and generally larger [[community]]. Also enforcement of a new language in legislation, education, literature, worshiping counts as forced assimilation. Unlike [[ethnic cleansing]], the local population is not forced to leave a certain area. Instead the population becomes assimilated by force. It has often been used after an area has changed nationality, often in the aftermath of war. Some examples are both the German and French forced assimilation in the provinces [[Alsace]] and (at least a part of) [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]], and some decades after the Swedish conquests of the Danish provinces [[Scania]], [[Blekinge]] and [[Halland]] the local population was submitted to forced assimilation.

==Ethnic assimilation==
If a [[country|state]] puts extreme emphasis on a homogeneous [[national identity]], it may resort, especially in the case of minorities originating from historical foes, to harsh, even extreme measures to 'exterminate' the minority culture, sometimes to the point of considering the only alternative its physical elimination ([[Population transfer|expulsion]] or even [[genocide]]).

States, mostly based on the idea of nation, perceived the presence of ethnic or linguistic minorities as a danger for their own [[territorial integrity]]. In fact minorities could claim their own independence, or to be rejoined with their own motherland. The consequence was the weakening or disappearing of several ethnic minorities.  [[Forced migration]]s took place after each of the two [[world wars]].

The latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century saw the rise of [[nationalism]]. Previously, a country consisted largely of whatever peoples lived on the land that was under the dominion of a particular ruler. Thus, as principalities and kingdoms grew through conquest and marriage, a ruler could wind up with peoples of many different ethnicities under his dominion.  This also reflected the long history of migrations of different tribes and peoples through Europe.

The concept of nationalism was based on the idea of a "people" who shared a common bond through [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], [[language]] and [[culture]]. Furthermore, nationalism asserted that each "people" had a right to its own nation. Much of [[European history]] in the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century can be understood as efforts to realign national boundaries with this concept of "one people, one nation". Such scenes also happened in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], as the two countries stated themselves as a single-nation country, ethnic minorities had to hide their national identity for centuries, and many resulted in assimilation, such as [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuan people]] in Japan, migrants of [[Goguryeo]], [[Balhae]] and [[Tungusic peoples]] in Korea. Much conflict would arise when one nation asserted territorial rights to land outside its borders on the basis of a common bond with the people living on that land. (Example: organized territorial rights by [[Russia]] for [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]'s breakaway province of South [[Ossetia]] to North Ossetia)  Another source of conflict arose when a group of people who constituted a minority in one nation would seek to secede from the nation either to form an independent nation or join another nation with whom they felt stronger ties. Yet another source of conflict was the desire of some nations to expel people from territory within its borders on the ground that those people did not share a common bond with the majority of people living in that nation.{{specify|date=July 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

It is useful to contrast the mass migrations and forced expulsion of ethnic [[Ethnic Germans|Germans]] out of [[Eastern Europe]] with other massive transfers of populations, such as exchange of populations between [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]], and population exchanges that occurred after the [[Partition of India]]. In all cases those expelled suffered greatly.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Religious assimilation==
{{see also|Jewish assimilation}}
Assimilation also includes the (often [[forced conversion|forced]]) [[religious conversion|conversion]] or [[secularization]] of religious members of a minority group.

Throughout the Middle Ages and until the mid-19th century, most Jews in Europe were forced to live in small towns ([[shtetl]]s) and were restricted from entering universities or high-level professions. See also [[Christianity in Pakistan]] for contemporary issues.

==Immigration==
When new [[immigrant]]s enter a country, there is a tension as they adapt to new people and surroundings to fit in, while holding on to their original culture. Here, studies show that native inhabitants often expect assimilation especially from negatively viewed immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Montreuil | first1 = Annie | last2 = Richard | first2 = Y.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1784">The term '''Formalesque''' was coined in 1994 by Australian art historian [[Bernard William Smith|Bernard Smith]] to replace 
[[Modernism]] as the name of the [[Art styles, periods and movements|artistic style]] of the period from around 1890 to 1960, now that this is no longer "modern".

''[[Modernism]]'' had emerged as a generic term to replace ''[[Post-Impressionism]]'' for the paintings of [[Manet]], [[Cézanne]], [[van Gogh]], and [[Gauguin]]. According to Smith, the key emphasis in such work is the importance of ''form'' and ''flatness''. The term was soon applied also in architecture (e.g. [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Walter Gropius]]) and sculpture (e.g. [[Jacob Epstein|Epstein]] and [[Brâncuși]]).

After 1960, Modernism was displaced by [[Postmodern art|Postmodernism]], and then by the art still at present referred to as "[[contemporary art]]". Since [[Modernism]] is no longer "modern", Smith argues that it requires a more appropriate [[Art styles, periods and movements|period style]] name to distinguish it: hence his introduction of '''Formalesque'''. Like "romanesque" and "arabesque", the name is intended to indicate a style that arose by the development of a basic interest in form (but without the specific connotations of the term [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]]).

[[File:Prague-golem-reproduction.jpg|thumb|A Prague reproduction of the Golem.]]

In [[Jewish folklore]], a '''golem''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|oʊ|l|ə|m}} {{respell|GOH|ləm}}; {{lang-he|גולם}}) is an animated [[anthropomorphic]] being that is magically created entirely from inanimate matter (usually [[clay]] or [[mud]]). The word was used to mean an amorphous, unformed material in [[Psalms]] and [[medieval]] writing.&lt;ref name=idel&gt;{{cite book|last=Idel|first=Moshe|year=1990|title=Golem: Jewish Magical and Mystical Traditions on the Artificial Anthropoid|location=Albany, New York|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0-7914-0160-X}} page 296&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous golem narrative involves [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]], the late-16th-century [[rabbi]] of [[Prague]]. There are many tales differing on how the golem was brought to life and afterward controlled.  According to ''[[Moment (magazine)|Moment Magazine]]'', "the golem is a highly mutable metaphor with seemingly limitless symbolism. It can be victim or villain, Jew or non-Jew, man or woman—or sometimes both. Over the centuries it has been used to connote war, community, isolation, hope and despair."&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;Cooper, Marilyn.

The word ''golem'' occurs once in the [[Bible]] in {{bibleverse|Psalm||139:16|JP}}, which uses the word {{lang|he|גלמי}} (''golmi''; my golem),&lt;ref name=Introduction/&gt; that means "my light form", "raw" material,&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=golem|encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary|editors=J.

Weiner|year=1989|edition=2nd| location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0-19-861186-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; connoting the unfinished human being before God's eyes.&lt;ref name=Introduction/&gt; The [[Mishnah]] uses the term for an uncultivated person: "Seven characteristics are in an uncultivated person, and seven in a learned one," (שבעה דברים בגולם) ([[Pirkei Avot]] 5:6 in the Hebrew text; English translations vary). In [[Modern Hebrew]], ''golem'' is used to mean "dumb" or "helpless". Similarly, it is often used today as a [[metaphor]] for a brainless lunk or entity who serves a man under controlled conditions but is hostile to him under others.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; "Golem" passed into [[Yiddish]] as ''goylem'' to mean someone who is stupid or lethargic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eqhur2UnvyIC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=goylem+definition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5LvqUYLSY5&amp;sig=RhfzWAKLT8ed8sXQHrN5J7q-n1Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-qsvc0vvbAhVytlkKHewSDDw4ChDoAQhIMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=goylem%20definition&amp;f=false|title=Anglish/Yinglish: Yiddish in American Life and Literature|last=Bluestein|first=Gene|date=1998|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803219148|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Earliest stories===
The oldest stories of golems date to early Judaism. In the [[Talmud]] (Tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 38b), [[Adam]] was initially created as a golem (גולם) when his dust was "kneaded into a shapeless husk." Like Adam, all golems are [[creation of man from clay|created from mud]] by those close to divinity, but no anthropogenic golem is fully human. Early on, the main disability of the golem was its inability to speak. [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 65b describes [[Rava (amora)|Rava]] creating a man (''gavra''). He sent the man to [[Rav Zeira]]. Rav Zeira spoke to him, but he did not answer. Rav Zeira said, "You were created by the sages; return to your dust".

During the [[Middle Ages]], passages from the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'' (''Book of Creation'') were studied as a means to create and animate a golem, although there is little in the writings of Jewish mysticism that supports this belief. It was believed that golems could be activated by an [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] experience induced by the ritualistic use of various letters of the Hebrew Alphabet&lt;ref name=idel/&gt; forming a "''[[Shemhamphorasch|shem]]''" (any one of the [[Names of God in Judaism|Names of God]]), wherein the ''shem'' was written on a piece of paper and inserted in the mouth or in the forehead of the golem.&lt;ref name=jewishencyclopedia/&gt;

A golem is inscribed with Hebrew words in some tales (for example, some versions of Chełm and Prague, as well as in Polish tales and versions of [[Brothers Grimm]]), such as the word ''emet'' (אמת, "truth" in Hebrew) written on its forehead. The golem could then be deactivated by removing the aleph (א) in ''emet'',&lt;ref&gt;Kerstein, Benjamin.  ''Jewish Ideas Daily''.  14 September 2010.  24 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; thus changing the inscription from "truth" to "death" (''met'' מת, meaning "dead").  Rabbi Jacob ben Shalom arrived at [[Barcelona]] from Germany in 1325 and remarked that the law of destruction is the reversal of the law of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trachtenberg|first=Joshua|title=Jewish Magic and Superstition|location=Philadelphia|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|year=2004|origyear=Originally published 1939|isbn=9780812218626|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One source credits 11th century Jew [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] with creating a golem,&lt;ref&gt;Bokser, Ben Zion (2006). From the World of the Cabbalah. Kessinger. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly female, for household chores.&lt;ref name=je-ibngabirol&gt;{{cite Jewish Encyclopedia

[[Joseph Delmedigo]] informs us in 1625 that "many legends of this sort are current, particularly in Germany."&lt;ref name=magic/&gt;

The earliest known written account of how to create a golem can be found in ''Sodei Razayya'' by [[Eleazar ben Judah]] of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] of the late 12th and early 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.matthewkressel.net/2015/10/01/36-days-of-judaic-myth-day-24-the-golem-of-prague/|title=36 Days of Judaic Myth: Day 24, The Golem of Prague|last=Kressel|first=Matthew|date=2015-10-01|work=Matthew Kressel|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest description of the creation of a golem by a historical figure is included in a tradition connected to [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm|Rabbi Eliyahu]] of [[Chełm]] (1550–1583).&lt;ref name=idel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Introduction&gt;[http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472117598-intro.pdf Introduction to "The Golem Returns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012061347/http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472117598-intro.pdf |date=2012-10-12 }}.

A [[Poland|Polish]] [[kabbalah|Kabbalist]], writing in about 1630–1650, reported the creation of a golem by Rabbi Eliyahu thus: "And I have heard, in a certain and explicit way, from several respectable persons that one man [living] close to our time, whose name is R. Eliyahu, the master of the name, who made a creature out of matter [Heb. ''Golem''] and form [Heb. ''tzurah''] and it performed hard work for him, for a long period, and the name of ''emet'' was hanging upon his neck, until he finally removed it for a certain reason, the name from his neck and it turned to dust."&lt;ref name=idel/&gt; A similar account was reported by a Christian author, Christoph Arnold, in 1674.&lt;ref name=idel/&gt;

Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]] (d. 1776) elaborated on the story in a book published in 1748: &lt;blockquote&gt;"As an aside, I'll mention here what I heard from my father's holy mouth regarding the Golem created by his ancestor, the Gaon R. Eliyahu Ba'al Shem of blessed memory. When the Gaon saw that the Golem was growing larger and larger, he feared that the Golem would destroy the universe. He then removed the Holy Name that was embedded on his forehead, thus causing him to disintegrate and return to dust. Nonetheless, while he was engaged in extracting the Holy Name from him, the Golem injured him, scarring him on the face."&lt;ref&gt;שו"ת שאילת יעב"ץ, ח"ב, [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1408&amp;pgnum=225 סי' פ"ב] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509025816/http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1408&amp;pgnum=225 |date=2013-05-09 }}.

According to the Polish Kabbalist, "the legend was known to several persons, thus allowing us to speculate that the legend had indeed circulated for some time before it was committed to writing and, consequently, we may assume that its origins are to be traced to the generation immediately following the death of R. Eliyahu, if not earlier."&lt;ref name=idel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The tradition is also recorded in ה לחורבנה / תל-אביב : ארגון יוצאי חלם בישראל ובארה"ב, תשמ"א&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous golem narrative involves [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]], the late 16th century rabbi of [[Prague]], also known as the Maharal, who reportedly "created a [g]olem out of clay from the banks of the [[Vltava River]] and brought it to life through rituals and Hebrew incantations to defend the [[Prague]] ghetto from [[anti-Semitic]] attacks" and [[pogrom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Kayla.

Some [[Orthodox Jews]] believe that the Maharal did actually create a golem.  The evidence for this belief has been analyzed from an Orthodox Jewish perspective by Shnayer Z. Leiman.&lt;ref name=leiman&gt;Leiman, S.

===Sources of the Prague narrative===
The general view of historians and critics is that the story of the Golem of Prague was a German literary invention of the early 19th century.  According to John Neubauer, the first writers on the Prague Golem were:
* 1837: [[Berthold Auerbach]], ''Spinoza''
* 1841: Gustav Philippson, ''Der Golam, eine Legende''
* 1841: Franz Klutschak, ''Der Golam des Rabbi Löw''
* 1842: Adam Tendlau ''Der Golem des Hoch-Rabbi-Löw''
* 1847: Leopold Weisel, ''Der Golem''&lt;ref name=neubauer/&gt;

However, there are in fact a couple of slightly earlier examples, in 1834&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Glasenapp |first1=Gabriele von |editor1-last=Haug |editor1-first=Christine |editor2-last=Mayer |editor2-first=Franziska |editor3-last=Podewski |editor3-first=Madleen |title=Populäres Judentum: Medien, Debatten, Lesestoffe |date=Jun 2, 2009 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=9783484971042 |page=31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPzRvJgrMkEC&amp;pg=PA31 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Der jüdische Gil Blas |url=http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/-502/6 |language=German |quote=der Golam... des Rabbi Liwa, vom Volke der hohe Rabbi Löw genannt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1836&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frankl |first1=L.

All of these early accounts of the Golem of Prague are in German by Jewish writers. It has been suggested that they emerged as part of a Jewish [[folklore]] movement parallel with the contemporary German folklore movement.&lt;ref name=gelbin/&gt;

The origins of the story have been obscured by attempts to exaggerate its age and to pretend that it dates from the time of the Maharal. It has been said that [[Rabbi Yehudah Yudel Rosenberg|Rabbi Yudel Rosenberg]] (1859–1935)&lt;ref name="Kieval"&gt;Kieval, Hillel J.

Rosenberg claimed that the book was based upon a manuscript that he found in the main library in Metz. ''Wonders of Maharal'' "is generally recognized in academic circles to be a literary hoax".&lt;ref name=idel/&gt;&lt;ref name=tradition&gt;[http://traditionarchive.org/news/originals/Volume%2036/No.%201/The%20Adventure%20of%20the.pdf Leiman, S.Z., " The Adventure of The Maharal of Prague in London: R.

==The Golem of Vilna==
There is a similar tradition relating to the [[Vilna Gaon]] or "the saintly genius from Vilnius" (1720–1797). Rabbi [[Chaim Volozhin]] (Lithuania 1749–1821) reported in an introduction to ''Sifra de Tzeniuta'' that he once presented to his teacher, the Vilna Gaon, ten different versions of a certain passage in the ''Sefer Yetzira'' and asked the Gaon to determine the correct text.&lt;ref name="Chaim"&gt;Chaim of Volozhin.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=UXtWbo-QGoAC&amp;pg=PT197&amp;lpg=PT197&amp;dq=golem+Volozhin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QN3UmnwneO&amp;sig=dgIOspJMP-FDHhtKj0YCaQ20quk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFn4nQ2vDVAhUpsVQKHXb0BBkQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=golem%20Volozhin&amp;f=false "Sifra de Tzeniuta, Introduction."] ''The Kabbalistic Tradition: An Anthology of Jewish Mysticism'', edited by Alan Unterman.  ''Google Books''.  24 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaon immediately identified one version as the accurate rendition of the passage. The amazed student then commented to his teacher that, with such clarity, he should easily be able to create a live human. The Gaon affirmed Rabbi Chaim's assertion, and said that he once began to create a person when he was a child, under the age of 13, but during the process he received a sign from Heaven ordering him to desist because of his tender age.&lt;ref name="Chaim" /&gt;

==Hubris theme==
[[File:Clay-golem.jpg|upright|thumb|Statue of the Prague Golem created for the film ''[[The Emperor and the Golem]]'']]

The existence of a golem is sometimes a mixed blessing. Golems are not intelligent, and if commanded to perform a task, they will perform the instructions literally. In many depictions, Golems are inherently perfectly obedient. In its earliest known modern form, the Golem of Chełm became enormous and uncooperative. In one version of this story, the rabbi had to resort to trickery to deactivate it, whereupon it crumbled upon its creator and crushed him.&lt;ref name=Introduction/&gt; There is a similar [[hubris]] theme in ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'', and some other stories in popular culture, for example: ''[[The Terminator]]''. The theme also manifests itself in ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'', [[Karel Čapek]]'s 1921 play which coined the term [[robot]]; the play was written in Prague, and while Čapek denied that he modeled the robot after the Golem, there are many similarities in the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[Voyen Koreis|Koreis, Voyen]].  Introduction.

==Culture of the Czech Republic==
The Golem is a popular figure in the [[Czech Republic]]. There are several restaurants and other businesses whose names make reference to the creature, a Czech [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] ([[René Richter]]) goes by the nickname "Golem",&lt;ref name=newlife/&gt; and a Czech [[monster truck]] outfit calls itself the "Golem Team."

Abraham Akkerman preceded his article on human automatism in the contemporary city with a short satirical poem on a pair of golems turning human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Philosophical Urbanism and Deconstruction in City-Form: An Environmental Ethos for the Twenty-First Century|url=https://www.usask.ca/structurist/|first=Abraham|last=Akkerman|volume=43/44|pages=48–61|year=2003{{ndash}}2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904074945/https://www.usask.ca/structurist/|archivedate=2017-09-04|df=}} Published also as Paper CTS-04-06 by the Center for Theoretical Study, Prague.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clay Boy variation==
A Yiddish and Slavic folktale is the Clay Boy, which combines elements of the Golem and ''[[The Gingerbread Man]]'', in which a lonely couple makes a child out of clay, with disastrous or comical consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Cronan|first=Mary W.|title=Lutoschenka|magazine=The Story Teller's Magazine|year=1917|volume=5|issue=1|pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one common Russian version, an older couple, whose children have left home, makes a boy out of clay and dries him by their hearth. The Clay Boy comes to life; at first the couple is delighted and treats him like a real child, but the Clay Boy does not stop growing and eats all their food, then all their livestock, and then the Clay Boy eats his parents. The Clay Boy rampages through the village until he is smashed by a quick-thinking [[goat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ginsburg|first=Mirra|authorlink=Mirra Ginsburg|title=Clay Boy|year=1997|publisher=Greenwillow|location=New York|isbn=9780688144098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Golem in popular culture==
[[File:Golem 1920 Poster.jpg|thumb|upright|Golem movie poster (1920)]]
[[File:Golem by Philippe Semeria.jpg|thumb|upright|The Hebrew letters on the creature's head read "emet", meaning "truth". In some versions of the Chełm and Prague narratives, the Golem is killed by removing the first letter, making the word spell "met", meaning "dead".]]

* Mainstream European society adopted the golem in the early 20th century. Most notably, [[Gustav Meyrink]]'s 1914 novel ''[[The Golem (Meyrink)|Der Golem]]'' is loosely inspired by the tales of the golem created by [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Rabbi Loew]]. Another famous treatment from the same era is [[H. Leivick]]'s 1921 Yiddish-language "dramatic poem in eight sections", ''[[The Golem (Leivick)|The Golem]]''. In 1923, Romanian composer Nicolae Bretan wrote the one-act opera ''The Golem,'' first performed the following year in Cluj and later revived in Denver, Colorado, US in 1990. Nobel prize winner [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] also wrote a version of the legend,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Golem-Isaac-Bashevis-Singer/dp/0374327416|title=The Golem|last=Singer|first=Isaac Bashevis|date=1983-01-01|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=9780374327415|language=English|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020171853/https://www.amazon.com/Golem-Isaac-Bashevis-Singer/dp/0374327416|archivedate=2016-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elie Wiesel]] wrote a children's book on the legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Golem-Elie-Wiesel/dp/0671454838|title=The Golem|last=Wiesel|first=Elie|date=1983-09-01|publisher=Summit Books|isbn=9780671454838|edition=1st|language=English|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020172200/https://www.amazon.com/Golem-Elie-Wiesel/dp/0671454838|archivedate=2016-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inspired by Gustav Meyrink's novel was a classic set of [[Expressionism (film)|expressionistic]] [[silent movies]] (1915–1920), [[Paul Wegener]]'s ''Golem'' series, of which ''[[The Golem: How He Came into the World]]'' (also released as ''The Golem'', 1920, US 1921: the only surviving film of the trilogy) is especially famous. In the first film the golem is revived in modern times before falling from a tower and breaking apart. Also notable is [[Julien Duvivier]]'s ''[[Le Golem]]'' (1936), a French/Czechoslovakian sequel to the [[Paul Wegener|Wegener]] film.
* A two-part [[Czechoslovakia]]n color film ''[[The Emperor and the Golem]]'' was produced in 1951.
* ''[[It! (1967 film)|It!]]'' (alternate titles: Anger of the Golem, Curse of the Golem) is a 1967 British horror film made by Seven Arts Productions and Gold Star Productions, Ltd. that features the Golem of Prague as its main subject. It stars [[Roddy McDowall]] as the mad assistant museum curator Arthur Pimm, who brings the golem to life.
* In 1974, [[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]] aired an episode entitled ''The Golem'', which takes place during the Holocaust, and [[Marvel Comics]] published three ''Strange Tales'' comic books that included a golem character, and later series included variations of the golem idea.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlik, John V.

* [[Marge Piercy]]'s 1991 [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]]-winning novel ''[[He, She and It]]'' features a substantial subplot that retells the story of Rabbi Loew and his golem.
* The novels of [[Terry Pratchett]] in the fictional setting of [[Discworld]] also include several golems as characters. They are introduced in the 19th Discworld novel, [[Feet of Clay (novel)|''Feet of Clay'' (novel)]] (1996).
* The Golem of Prague is an antihero in DC Comics' 1991 reboot of the superhero [[Ragman (comics)|Ragman]]. In the story, it serves as the predecessor to the Ragman suit itself, replaced by the Rabbis as a protector when it becomes uncontrollable. When the main character, Rory Regan, gains control of the Ragman suit, the Golem reawakens and hunts him down, but falls in love with a human woman along the way. The Golem later returned in the 1993 sequel series, "Ragman: Cry of the Dead".
* In [[Cynthia Ozick]]'s 1997 novel ''[[The Puttermesser Papers]],'' a modern Jewish woman, Ruth Puttermesser, creates a female golem out of the dirt in her flowerpots to serve as the daughter she never had. The golem helps Puttermesser become elected Mayor of New York before it begins to run out of control.

* [[Michael Chabon]]'s 2000 novel, ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay]]'', features one of the protagonists, escape artist Josef Kavalier, smuggling himself out of Prague along with the golem. Petrie describes the theme of escape in the novel, culminating in Kavalier's own drawing of a modern [[graphic novel]] centered on a golem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petrie|first=Windy Counsell|year=2007|title=For Illumination and Escape: Writing and Rgeneration in 21st Century Jewish-American Literature|journal=LITERATÛRA|volume=49|issue=5|pages=105–107|issn=0258-0802|quote=Jewish Golem out of Prague into Vilnius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Golems appear in the fantasy role-playing game ''[[Dungeons and Dragons|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (first published in the 1970s), and the influence of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''&lt;ref&gt;PC Gamer, "How Dungeons &amp; Dragons shaped the modern videogame"&lt;/ref&gt; has led to the inclusion of golems in other [[Role-playing game (pen and paper)|tabletop role-playing games]] as well as in [[video games]].
&lt;!-- The above sentence mentions that Golems are a common feature of fantasy RPGs and computer games. No need to add any specific example unless the Golem is particularly notable. --&gt;
&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD ANYTHING WITHOUT A PRINTED SOURCE. While some websites are acceptable, Bulbapedia and fansites are not, so it's just easier to say "don't use a website" because it's probably not going to meet the reliable sourcing guidelines. --&gt;
* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' 2006 episode "[[Treehouse of Horror XVII]]" (season 15, episode 8), the Golem of Prague is the key character in the second segment, "You Gotta Know When to Golem", where the Simpson family also creates a second Golem made of [[Play-Doh]].
* In the video game [[Minecraft]], golems are found as mobs, which are divided into 2 types: the Iron Golem and the Snow Golem, with the Iron Golem more resembling the traditional Golem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1723">In the US, the [[acronym]] '''ILT''' typically stands for [[Instructor-led training]] and is commonly used to distinguish training delivered by a live instructor from self-paced, pre-recorded content such as [[e-learning]]

In the UK, the acronym can also mean Information and Learning Technology where it is typically used within the British Further Education sector.

Information and Learning Technology describes the methods of using technology to enhance the learning experience within education.

==Possible applications of Information and Learning Technology ==
* Use of sound within an otherwise static presentation: There may be an image in a [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] presentation, which could be clicked upon in different areas to provide audio commentary.
* Use of digital video or digital images for learning activities.
* Use of a [[Virtual learning environment|VLE]] to run courses and activities within and outside an educational establishment.
* Interactive quizzes/activities - either online or within a classroom using an electronic voting system made up of infra-red handsets and a receiver.
* Use of [[podcasts]] or downloadable [[MP3]]s for classroom notes, revision or whole lectures.
* Use of collaborative documents within a group environment.
* Use of planification, budget-tracking and resource management software such as a [[Training Management System]] to streamline back-office training processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://trainingmag.com/why-lmss-are-not-built-manage-instructor-led-training%E2%80%94and-what-do-about-it |title=Why LMS's are not built to manage ILT and what to do about it |publisher=Training Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12342">{{About|the English personal pronoun|other uses|I (disambiguation)}}
The pronoun '''''I''''' {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} is the [[grammatical person|first-person]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[nominative case]] [[personal pronoun]] in [[Modern English]].  It is used to refer to one's [[self]] and is [[capitalization|capitalized]], although other pronouns, such as ''he'' or ''she'', are not capitalized.

The grammatical variants of ''I'' are ''me'', ''my'', ''mine'', and ''myself''.

==Etymology==
{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2015}}
{{Further|Old English pronouns|Proto-Germanic pronouns|Proto-Indo-European pronouns}}
English ''I'' originates from [[Old English]] (OE) ''ic''. Its predecessor ''ic'' had in turn originated from the continuation of [[Proto-Germanic]] *''ik'', and ''ek''; the asterisk denotes an unattested form, ''ek'' was attested in the [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions (in some cases notably showing the variant ''eka''; see also [[ek erilaz]]). Linguists assume ''ik'' to have developed from the unstressed variant of ''ek''. Variants of ''ic'' were used in various English dialects up until the 1600s.{{sfn| OED online}}

Germanic cognates are: [[Old Frisian]] ''ik'', [[Old Norse]] ''ek'' ([[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''jeg'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''jag'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ég), [[Old High German]] ''ih'' ([[German language|German]] ''[[:wikt:ich|ich]]'') and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''ik'' and in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] also "ik".

The Proto-Germanic root came, in turn, from the [[Proto Indo-European language]] (PIE). The reconstructed PIE pronoun is *''egō, egóm'', with cognates including
[[Sanskrit]] ''aham'', [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''uk'', [[Latin]] ''ego'', [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἐγώ}} ''egō'', [[Common Slavonic|Old Slavonic]] ''azъ'' and [[Alviri-Vidari language|Alviri-Vidari]] (an Iranian language) {{lang|fa|اَز}} ''az''.

The oblique forms are formed from a stem  ''*me-'' (English ''me''), the plural from ''*wei-'' (English ''we''), the oblique plurals from ''*ns-'' (English ''us'') and from Proto-Germanic ''*unseraz'', PIE ''*no-s-ero-'' (''our, ours'').

== Capitalization ==
''I'' (and only this form of the pronoun) is the only pronoun that is always capitalized in English.{{Efn-lr|Other pronouns may be capitalized when referring to the Deity ("God's in His heaven") and, of course, when beginning a sentence. The capitalization of the first person pronoun is distinctive of English, although it is common in other languages to capitalize a second person pronoun, for example ''Sie'' in German.}} This practice became established in the late 15th century, though lowercase ''i'' was sometimes found as late as the 17th century.{{Sfn|Fowler|2015}}

== Case forms ==
{{See also|Objective case#English}}
Like the  other [[English personal pronouns]] ''we'' (''us''), ''he'' (''him''), ''she'' (''her''), and ''they'' (''them''), the pronoun ''I'' has several singular case forms.{{efn-lr |name=Terminology|Terminological note: &lt;br/&gt;Authorities use different terms for the inflectional ([[grammatical case|case]]) forms of the personal pronouns, such as the [[oblique case|oblique-case]] form ''me'', which is used as a direct object, indirect object, or object of a preposition, as well as other uses. For instance, one standard work on English grammar, ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'', uses the term ''objective case'', while another, ''[[The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]]'', uses the term ''accusative'' case. Similarly, some use the term ''nominative'' for the form ''I'', while others use the term ''subjective''. Some authorities use the term ''genitive'' for forms such as ''my'' where others use the term ''possessive''. Some grammars refer to ''my'' and ''mine'', respectively, as the ''dependent genitive'' and the ''independent genitive'', while others call ''my'' a ''possessive adjective'' and ''mine'' a ''possessive pronoun''.}}
These are:{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=458}} 
* ''I'', the nominative (or subjective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form 
* ''me'', the accusative (or objective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form
* ''my'', the dependent genitive (or possessive adjective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form
* ''mine'', the independent genitive case form (or possessive pronoun{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}})

=== Use of ''I'' and ''me'' ===
There are some situations in which only the nominative form (''I'')  is grammatically correct and others in which only the accusative form (''me'')  is correct. There are also situations in which one form is used in informal style (and was often considered ungrammatical by older prescriptive grammars) and the other form is preferred in formal style.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=458}}

====Exclusive use of nominative ''I''====
In all varieties of standard English, the nominative form ''I'' is used exclusively when it is the whole{{efn-lr|name=Non-coordinative|Not part of a  coordinative construction with ''and'', for instance.}} subject of an ''explicit'' verb,{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=458-459}} e.g. 
* "I did it."
not 
* * "Me did it."{{efn-lr|name=Asterisk|The asterisk preceding this example indicates that the utterance is not acceptable in standard English. For an explanation of this linguistic convention, see [[Asterisk#Linguistics]]}}
With other pronouns, such as ''we'' (strictly speaking when used as a personal determiner), there may be exceptions to this in some varieties of English.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}

====Exclusive use of accusative ''me''====
In all varieties of standard English, the accusative form ''me'' is used exclusively when it is the whole{{efn-lr|name=Non-coordinative}} direct or indirect object{{efn-lr|including the subject of a non-finite clause introduced by ''for'', e.g. "For me to do that would be more than a crime."}} of a verb or preposition.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}  The accusative ''me'' is also required in a number of constructions such as "Silly me!"{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=461–462}}

====Alternative use of nominative and accusative====
In many situations, both the nominative ''I'' and the accusative ''me'' are encountered.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=459–461}}

When the pronoun is used as a subjective predicative complement, the nominative ''I'' is sometimes encountered in (very)  formal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=459–461}}
* "It is I."
But this is often seen as hypercorrect and may be unacceptable, as in:
* * "This one [photograph] is I as a baby.{{efn-lr|name=Asterisk}}
''Me'' is usually preferred as a subjective predicate, especially in informal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}
* "This is me as a baby." 
* "It's me!"
The nominative ''I'' is more common in this role when it is followed by a relative clause:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}
* "It is I she loves." 
* "It is I who love you." 
though even here ''me'' is more common in non-formal style:
* "It's me she loves." 
* "It's me who loves you."

Following ''as'' or ''than'' (without a following explicit verb),  the accusative form is common:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=460}}
* "She is older than me."
However, where it is possible to think of the pronoun as the subject of an implicit verb and ''than'' or ''as'' as a conjunction, the nominative ''I'' is found in formal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=460}}
* "She is older than I [am]."

In [[Australian English]], [[British English]] and [[Irish English]], many speakers have an unstressed form of ''my'' that is identical to ''me'' (see [[English personal pronouns#Archaic and non-standard forms|archaic and non-standard forms of English personal pronouns]]).

=====Coordinative constructions=====
The above applies when the pronoun stands alone as the subject or object.
In some  varieties  English (particularly formal English), those rules also apply in coordinative constructions such as "you and I".{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462–463}} So the correct form is 
* "My husband and I wish you a merry Christmas."
* "Between you and me ..."

In some varieties of non-standard informal English, the accusative is sometimes used when the pronoun is part of a coordinative ''subject'' construction,{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462–463}} as in
* "Phil and me wish you a merry Christmas."
This is highly stigmatized.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462-463}}

On the other hand, the use of the nominative ''I'' in coordinative constructions like "you and I"where ''me'' would be used in a non-coordinative object is less stigmatized – and in some cases so widespread as to be considered a variety of standard English:{{sfn |Huddleston |Pullum |2002 |p=463}} 
* "President Bush graciously invited Michelle and I to meet with him ..."
* "All debts are cleared between you and I".

'''Indigenous Philippine art''' is [[art]] made by the [[indigenous peoples of the Philippines]]. It includes works in raw materials such as extract from trees, fruits, and vegetables. Some of the art treasure of the Philippines is found in rock in caves, trees and woods.

==Agono Rock engravings==
In one cave, there are different [[carving]]s created by former resident tribes. They are the oldest known [[cave art]] carvings in the Philippines, dating to approximately 1000 B.C. Originally, there were 127 [[engraving]]s of human and animal figures in stick form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artesdelasfilipinas.com/archives/17/the-angono-petroglyphs/ |title=The Agono Petroglyphs |author=Teta Limcangco |publisher=Artesdelasfilipinas.com |date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kahanism''' is an [[Extremism|extremist]] Jewish ideology based on the views of Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], founder of the [[Jewish Defense League]] and the [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] party in [[Israel]]. Kahane maintained the view that the majority of [[Arabs]] living in Israel are enemies of Jews and Israel itself, he believed that a [[Halakha|Jewish theocratic state]], where non-Jews have no voting rights, should be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kahane.org/meir/interview.htm |title=God's Law: an Interview with Rabbi Meir Kahane |accessdate=2012-12-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219141224/http://kahane.org/meir/interview.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2009 |df= }}: "Any non-Jew, including the Arabs, can have the status of a foreign resident in Israel if he accepts the law of the Halacha. I don’t differentiate between Arabs and non-Arabs. The only difference I make is between Jews and non-Jews. If a non-Jew wants to live here, he must agree to be a foreign resident, be he Arab or not. He does not have and cannot have national rights in Israel. He can have civil rights, social rights, but he cannot be a citizen; he won’t have the right to vote. Again, whether he’s Arab or not."&lt;/ref&gt; The Kach party has been banned by the Israeli government and the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] has labeled it a [[Foreign Terrorist Organization]].&lt;ref name="state.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/45313.pdf|title=Country Reports on Terrorism 2004|last=|first=|date=|website=State.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
While it is difficult to define ''Kahanism'' in an official manner, the term has come to denote the controversial positions espoused by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]]. Kahane's positions spanned a broad range of subjects.
* '''[[Aliyah]]:''' Kahane believed that every Jew should live in Israel.
* '''[[Antisemitism|Anti-Semitism]]:''' Kahane believed that anti-Semitism should be fought immediately and by all means necessary.
* '''[[Democracy]]:''' Kahane wrote that democracy was the best form of government for those who lacked a divine truth and a standard of good and evil.
* '''[[Hatred|Hate]] and [[Violence]]:''' Kahane believed that hate and violence were terrible, but terribly necessary at the right time and place.
* '''[[Holocaust]]:''' Kahane felt that the history of the Holocaust should be taught to youth with all of the lessons that it implied, including the need to fight spiritual assimilation, the need to physically defend the Jewish people and the importance of leaving what he termed "the Exile".
* '''[[Israel]]:''' Kahane proposed that the State of Israel should enforce [[Halakha|Jewish law]], as codified by [[Maimonides]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Maimonides | title = Mishne Torah, Laws of Kings, Ch. 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; under which non-Jews who wish to dwell in Israel would have three options: remain as "resident strangers" with all rights but national ones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Meir Kahane | title = Uncomfortable Questions for Comfortable Jews | quote = All Arabs who are prepared to accept the State of Israel as the exclusive state of the Jewish people and of no one else, will be allowed to remain in the land with the status of "resident stranger," as per Jewish laws. They will be granted personal rights but no national ones. They will have general economic, social, cultural, and [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] but will not be citizens of the Jewish State and will have nothing to say in its future in any way. Accepting this status, they are welcome to remain and are entitled to all the respect and decency that [[Judaism]] demands we grant to all humans who are resident strangers in our land and who bow to its laws and concepts. | pages= 250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would require non-Jews to accept resident-stranger status with all rights but political ones. Those who are unwilling to accept such a status will be required to leave the country with full compensation and, those who refuse to do even that, will be forcefully removed.
* '''Judaism:''' Kahane stressed that Jewish is beautiful. He felt that the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] movements have been the leading causes of assimilation due to their discontinuation of the belief in mass [[Revelation]] as the cornerstone of [[Jewish]] theology.
* '''Love of Fellow [[Jews]]:''' Kahane emphasized the importance of loving Jews and the willingness to sacrifice for Jewish brothers.
* '''[[Pride]]:''' Kahane felt that Jews should embrace pride in their heritage and [[Judaism|tradition]].
* '''Respect:''' Kahane stated that there is nothing more important than respect and he added that only one who respects himself can end up respecting others.
* '''[[Torah]]:''' Kahane wrote that every Jew should have enough Torah knowledge to be a qualified [[rabbi]].
* '''Unity:''' Kahane felt that Jewish unity was of the utmost importance, and he believed that everything should be done in order to avoid a Jewish [[civil war]].

The central claim of Kahanism is the belief that the vast majority of the [[Arabs]] of Israel are now, and they will continue to be, enemies of Jews and Israel itself, and that a [[Halachic state|Jewish theocratic state]], governed by [[Halakha]], absent of a voting non-Jewish population that includes [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], areas of modern-day [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]], should be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kahane.org/meir/interview.htm |title=God's Law: an Interview with Rabbi Meir Kahane |accessdate=2012-12-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219141224/http://kahane.org/meir/interview.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2009 |df= }}: "The southern boundary goes up to El Arish, which takes in all of northern Sinai, including Yamit. To the east, the frontier runs along the western part of the East Bank of the Jordan river, hence part of what is now [[Jordan]]. ''Eretz Yisrael'' also includes part of [[Lebanon]], and certain parts of [[Syria]], and part of [[Iraq]], all the way to the [[Tigris]] river."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kahane, the term "Kahanism" is primarily used by those who are ignorant of [[Torah Judaism]] in order to discredit his [[ideology]],{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} which he asserted is rooted in [[Halakha]]{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} and the same as Torah Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/RabbiKahanesBooks]: "I am committed to Judaism and real Jewish values, and every word in this book – disagreeable as it may be to most – is Judaism."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2010}}{{Better source|date=August 2010}} "Meir Kahane did not hate the Arabs – he just loved the Jews", said his widow Libby in her November 20, 2010 TV interview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=753204 Special: Meir Kahane's widow regrets Rabin murder] (Heb: מיוחד: אלמנתו של מאיר כהנא מסתייגת מרצח רבין), [[Channel 10 (Israel)]], November 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and legal action==
Since 1985, the [[Government of Israel|Israeli government]] has outlawed political parties espousing Kahane's ideology as being "[[Racism|racist]]", and it forbids their participation in the Israeli government. The [[Kach Party|Kach]] party was banned from running for the [[Knesset]] in 1988, while the existence of the two Kahanist movements formed following Kahane's assassination in 1990&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&amp;res=9402E7DD1339F93AA25751C1A9669C8B63&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fK%2fKahane%2c%20Meir Terror Label No Hindrance To Anti-Arab Jewish Group] New York Times, 19 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; were proclaimed illegal terrorist organizations in 1994 and the groups were subsequently officially disbanded.  Activities by followers with militant Kahanist beliefs continue to the present today, however, as seen below. In 2001, the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] described the official Kahanist website, which was kahane.org at the time, as a [[hate site]] espousing prejudiced views in which 'Arabs generally and Palestinians in particular are vilified.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/AllSymbols/FA869F4E19CCCBC1C1256A570031F062/$File/G0113724.doc?OpenElement UN report on the use of the Internet for incitement to racial hatred]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable kahanist terrorists ==

===Baruch Goldstein===
{{Main|Cave of the Patriarchs massacre}}
The deadliest Jewish terrorist attack occurred when Dr. [[Baruch Goldstein]], supporter of [[Kach Party|Kach]], shot and killed 29 Muslim worshipers, and wounded another 150, at the [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre]] in [[Hebron]], in 1994. This was described as a case of Jewish religious terrorism by [[Mark Juergensmeyer]].&lt;ref name="mind"&gt;{{cite book|title=Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence|author=Mark Juergensmeyer|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-24011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}Goldstein was a medical doctor who grew up in Brooklyn and he was educated at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. He resettled in the [[Kiryat Arba]] settlement in the [[West Bank]], and he was politically active for years – he saw Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]] as a [[hero]],&lt;ref name="mind"/&gt;{{rp|53}} and he was Kahane's campaign manager when he ran for the Israeli parliament through Kahane's Kach party.&lt;ref name="mind"/&gt;{{rp|8}}  When Goldstein was threatened with a [[court-martial]] for refusing to treat non-Jewish soldiers in the Israeli Defence Force, he declared: "I am not willing to treat any non-Jew. I recognize as legitimate only two [[religious]] authorities: [[Maimonides]] and [[Meir Kahane|Kahane]]."&lt;ref name="kizel"&gt;Arych Kizel in ''Yediot Aharonot,'' 1 March 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstein was denounced "with shocked horror" by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]],&lt;ref&gt;The ethics of war in Asian civilizations: a comparative perspective By Torkel Brekke, Routledge, 2006, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; and most Israelis denounced Goldstein as insane.&lt;ref&gt;1 Wilson, Rodney. 2007. Review Article: Islam and Terrorism. British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies. 34(2):203-213.  [http://www.informaworld.com/10.1080/13530190701427933]. (accessed 29 August 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] condemned the attack, describing Goldstein as a "degenerate murderer", "a shame on [[Zionism]] and an embarrassment to [[Judaism]]".&lt;ref name=nytimes940301&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/01/world/west-bank-massacre-overview-rabin-urges-palestinians-put-aside-anger-talk.html?scp=4&amp;sq=Goldstein%20Rabin&amp;st=cse ''West Bank Massacre: The Overview; Rabin Urges the Palestinians To Put Aside Anger and Talk'']. Haberman, Clyde. [[The New York Times]]. March 1, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03EFD8153AF931A35750C0A962958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=WEST BANK MASSACRE; In 'Tragic Error,' Soldiers Kill a Settler|author=Alan Cowell|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|date=March 2, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800EEDF1E3AF935A35750C0A962958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=The World; Palestinians See a People's Hatred in a Killer's Deed|author=Youssef M. Ibrahim|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|date=March 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Goldstein's actions were praised by some extremist settlers; Yochay Ron said that he "felt good" when he heard the news, and he also stated that Jews were "at war with the Arabs" and "all Arabs who live here are a danger to us... they threaten the very existence of the Jewish community on the West Bank."&lt;ref name="mind"/&gt;{{rp|52}} Goldstein and other religious settlers at [[Beit Hadassah]] (both Kahanist and [[Gush Emunim]]) believe that the biblical lands on the West Bank are sacred, that Jews are required by [[God]] to occupy them, and that the presence of Muslims desecrates the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref name="mind"/&gt;{{rp|51–52}} After this attack, members of the Kach Party praised Goldstein's actions, and in the ensuing political turmoil, the Knesset banned Kach in Israel. The Shamgar Commission in Israel concluded that Baruch Goldstein acted alone.

===Yoel Lerner===
{{Main|Yoel Lerner}}
In October 1982 [[Yoel Lerner]], a member of Meir Kahane's Kach, attempted to blow up the [[Dome of the Rock]] in order to rebuild the [[Temple Mount]] site.&lt;ref name="mind"/&gt;{{rp|45}} He was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. [[Mark Juergensmeyer]] identified him as a Jewish religious terrorist, writing that he "yearned for a Jewish society in Israel. He hoped for the restoration of the ancient temple in Jerusalem, the exclusive right of Jews to settle on the West Bank of the Jordan River, and the creation of a state based on biblical law."&lt;ref name="mind"/&gt;{{rp|45}} Lerner had previously served a three-year sentence for heading a group that plotted to overthrow the government and establish a state based upon religious law.

===Eden Natan-Zada===
On August 4, 2005, [[Eden Natan-Zada]], an [[AWOL]] [[Israel Defense Forces]] soldier, killed four [[Israeli Arab]] citizens and wounded several others when he opened fire on a bus in the northern Israeli town of [[Shfaram]].  Natan-Zada had recently moved to the settlement of Tapuach, site of a Kahanist yeshiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/04/AR2005080401350.html|title=Jewish Settler Kills Four Israeli Arabs In Attack on Bus|date=2005-08-05|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zada was handcuffed by the Israeli police who arrived to the scene but then lynched by the mob.

==Alleged Kahanist violence==
Roadside shootings, stabbings and grenade attacks against Palestinians have been carried out in [[Jerusalem]] and the [[West Bank]] by individuals or groups suspected of having ties to the former Kach group. Aliases such as "The Committee for the Safety of the Roads"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827224552/http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3500|title=MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base|date=2007-08-27|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, "The Sword of David" and "The Repression of Traitors" have been used. The US government claims that these are all aliases of "[[Kach Party|Kach]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815012557/http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/rpt/fto/2801.htm#kach#kach|title=Background Information on Foreign Terrorist Organizations|date=2011-08-15|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a Kahanist group known as "Revenge of the Toddlers" claimed responsibility for a bombing attack at Tzur Baher, an [[East Jerusalem]] secondary school for Arab boys, that wounded seven. The group also claimed responsibility for the 2003 bombing of a Palestinian school in [[Jaba', Haifa Subdistrict|Jaba]] that injured 20 and it was also thought to be linked to the 2002 Zil Elementary school bombing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-dRUGqwLSE4C&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=%22Revenge+of+the+Toddlers%22+bomb&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GebFzXnyCc&amp;sig=pPHZVAavG0fFw8iNNCC4xr2_nNk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LTe_TJKTKYG0lQfVk5XhBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Revenge%20of%20the%20Toddlers%22%20bomb&amp;f=false The Israeli-Palestinian war: escalating to nowhere] By Anthony H.

In the [[United States]], Kahanist groups and organizations are largely inactive, and the bulk of their supporters have emigrated to Israel over the years. [[Kahane Net]], the [[Jewish Defense League]] and [[B'nai Elim]] (formed by former JDL activists) are occasionally associated with Kahanism.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Gentile support==

{{About|a measuring method|the album by Greydon Square|The Kardashev Scale (album)}}
The '''Kardashev scale''' is a method of measuring a [[civilization]]'s level of [[technology|technological]] advancement based on the amount of [[energy]] a civilization is able to use. It was proposed by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[astronomer]] [[Nikolai Kardashev]] in 1964&lt;ref name= Kard_TransInfoCiv /&gt;. The scale has three designated categories:

* A '''{{vanchor|Type&amp;nbsp;I civilization|TYPE_1_CIVILIZATION}}'''—also called a [[planetary civilization]]—can use and store all of the energy available on its [[planet]]. 
* A '''{{vanchor|Type&amp;nbsp;II civilization|TYPE_2_CIVILIZATION}}'''—also called a stellar civilization—can harness the total energy of its planet's parent star (the most popular hypothetical concept being the [[Dyson sphere]]—a device which would encompass the entire star and transfer its energy to the planet(s)).
* A '''{{vanchor|Type&amp;nbsp;III civilization|TYPE_3_CIVILIZATION}}'''—also called a galactic civilization—can control energy on the scale of its entire host [[galaxy]].&lt;ref name= "kardashev1984" /&gt;

The scale is hypothetical, and regards energy consumption on a [[Cosmos|cosmic]] scale. Various extensions of the scale have since been proposed, including a wider range of power levels (types 0, IV and V) and the use of metrics other than pure power.

==Definition==
In 1964, [[Nikolai Kardashev|Kardashev]] defined three levels of civilizations, based on the order of magnitude of [[power (physics)|power]] available to them:

; Type I
: Technological level of a civilization that can harness all the energy that falls on a planet from its parent star (for Earth-Sun system, this value is close to 7x10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; watts), which is more than five [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] higher than the amount presently attained on earth, with energy consumption at ≈4{{e|19}} [[erg]]/sec (4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; watts).&lt;ref name= Kard_TransInfoCiv&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kardashev| first =Nikolai| authorlink=Nikolai Kardashev| title=Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations| date = 1964 | journal=Soviet Astronomy | bibcode = 1964SvA.....8..217K | volume = 8 | page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomer Guillermo A. Lemarchand stated this as a level near contemporary terrestrial civilization with an energy capability equivalent to the solar insolation on Earth, between 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; watts.&lt;ref name= Lemarchand&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://www.coseti.org/lemarch1.htm | title = Detectability of Extraterrestrial Technological Activities | first = Guillermo A | last = Lemarchand | publisher = Coseti}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Type II
: A civilization capable of harnessing the energy radiated by its own star—for example, the stage of successful construction of a [[Dyson sphere]]—with energy consumption at ≈4{{e|33}} erg/sec.&lt;ref name = Kard_TransInfoCiv /&gt;  Lemarchand stated this as a civilization capable of utilizing and channeling the entire radiation output of its star.  The energy utilization would then be comparable to the luminosity of our [[Sun]], about 4{{e|33}} erg/sec (4×10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; [[watt]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s).&lt;ref name=Lemarchand/&gt;
; Type III
: A civilization in possession of energy on the scale of its own [[galaxy]], with energy consumption at ≈4{{e|44}} erg/sec.&lt;ref name=Kard_TransInfoCiv/&gt;  Lemarchand stated this as a civilization with access to the power comparable to the luminosity of the entire [[Milky Way]] galaxy, about 4{{e|44}} erg/sec (4×10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt; watts).&lt;ref name=Lemarchand/&gt;

==Current status of human civilization==
[[File:Annual world primary energy consumption.svg|right|thumbnail|250px|Total World, Annual Primary Energy Consumption.]]
[[File:Carl Sagan Planetary Society.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Color photo. Man sitting wearing a suit and smiling.|According to the astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], humanity is currently going through a phase of technical adolescence, "typical of a civilization about to integrate the type I Kardashev scale."]]
{{further information|World energy consumption}}

At the current time, Humans have not yet reached Type 1 civilization.
Physicist and futurist [[Michio Kaku]] suggested that humans may attain [[Planetary civilization|Type&amp;nbsp;I]] status in 100–200 years, Type&amp;nbsp;II status in a few thousand years, and Type&amp;nbsp;III status in 100,000 to a million years.&lt;ref name="Interstellar Travel"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kaku | first = Michio | authorlink = Michio Kaku | title = The Physics of Interstellar Travel: To one day, reach the stars. | date = 2010 | url = http://mkaku.org/home/?page_id=250 | accessdate = 2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Sagan]] suggested defining intermediate values (not considered in Kardashev's original scale) by [[interpolation|interpolating]] and [[extrapolation|extrapolating]] the values given above for types I (10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; W), II (10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; W) and III (10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; W), which would produce the formula

:&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{\log_{10}P - 6} {10}&lt;/math&gt;,

where value ''K'' is a civilization's Kardashev rating and ''P'' is the power it uses, in watts.  Using this extrapolation, a "'''Type 0'''" civilization, not defined by Kardashev, would control about 1 MW of power, and humanity's civilization type as of 1973 was about 0.7 (apparently using 10 [[Watt#Terawatt|terawatt]] (TW) as the value for 1970s humanity).&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Sagan |editor= Jerome Agel|others= [[Freeman J. Dyson]], David Morrison|title= Cosmic Connection: An Extraterrestrial Perspective |origyear= 1973|url= https://books.google.com/?id=lL57o9YB0mAC&amp;pg=PA156|accessdate= 2008-01-01|edition= |series= |date= October 2000|publisher= Cambridge Press |location= |language= |isbn= 978-0-521-78303-3|oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=I would suggest Type 1.0 as a civilization using 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; watts for interstellar communication; Type 1.1, 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; watts; Type 1.2, 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; watts, and so on. Our present civilization would be classed as something like Type 0.7.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, total [[world energy consumption]] was 553 [[joule|exajoules]] ({{val|553|e=18|u=J}}=153,611 TWh),&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite web | publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |work=Statistical Review of World Energy 2008-2012 |url=http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=44&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=2&amp;cid=ww,&amp;syid=2008&amp;eyid=2012&amp;unit=QBTU| title=Total Primary Energy Consumption 2008-2012 | format = cfm }}&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to an average power consumption of 17.54 TW (or 0.7244 on Sagan's Kardashev scale).

==Observational evidence==
In 2015, a study of galactic mid-[[infrared]] emissions came to the conclusion that "Kardashev Type-III civilizations are either very rare or do not exist in the [[Observable universe|local Universe]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv =1508.02624 |last1 = Garrett|first1 = Michael|title = The application of the Mid-IR radio correlation to the $\hat{G}$ sample and the search for advanced extraterrestrial civilizations|journal = Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume = 581|pages = L5|year = 2015|doi = 10.1051/0004-6361/201526687|bibcode = 2015A&amp;A...581L...5G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Paul Glister, author of the Centauri Dreams website, described a signal apparently from the star [[HD 164595]] as requiring the power of a Type I or Type II civilization, if produced by extraterrestrial lifeform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=36248|title=An Interesting SETI Candidate in Hercules|date=2016-08-27|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2016 it was discovered that the signal's origin was most likely a military satellite orbiting the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tass.com/science/896683|title=Alien signal detected by Russian astrophysicists turns out to be terrestrial disturbance|last=|first=|date=2016-08-30|website=tass.com|publisher=TASS|location=St. Petersburg, Russia|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy development==

===Type&amp;nbsp;I civilization methods===
* Large-scale application of [[fusion power]]. According to [[mass–energy equivalence]], Type&amp;nbsp;I implies the conversion of about 2&amp;nbsp;kg of matter to energy per second. An equivalent energy release could theoretically be achieved by fusing approximately 280&amp;nbsp;kg of [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]] per second,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Souers  | first = P. C. | title = Hydrogen properties for fusion energy | publisher = University of California Press | date = 1986 | page = 4 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=I2K6DKA1IMwC&amp;printsec=frontcover | isbn = 978-0-520-05500-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a rate roughly equivalent to 8.9×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; kg/year. A cubic&amp;nbsp;km of water contains about 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; kg of hydrogen, and the Earth's [[ocean]]s contain about [[ocean#Physical properties|1.3×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; cubic&amp;nbsp;km of water]], meaning that humans on Earth could sustain this rate of consumption over geological time-scales, in terms of available hydrogen.
* [[Antimatter]] in large quantities would have a mechanism to produce power on a scale several magnitudes above our current level of technology.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In antimatter-matter collisions, the entire [[rest mass]] of the particles is converted to [[radiant energy]]. Their [[energy density]] (energy released per mass) is about four orders of magnitude greater than that from using [[nuclear fission]], and about two orders of magnitude greater than the best possible yield from [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Steve K. | last = Borowski | authorlink = Lewis Research Center | title = Comparison of Fusion/Anti-matter Propulsion Systems for Interplanetary Travel | booktitle = Technical Memorandum 107030 | pages = 1–3 | publisher = [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] | date = 1987-07-29 | location = San Diego, California, USA | url = http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/1996/TM-107030.pdf | accessdate = 2008-01-28 | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080528030524/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/1996/TM-107030.pdf | archivedate = 2008-05-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction of 1&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] of anti-matter with 1&amp;nbsp;kg of matter would produce 1.8×10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[joule|J]] (180 petajoules) of energy.&lt;ref&gt;By the [[mass–energy equivalence]] formula ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''². See [[Antimatter fuel|antimatter as a fuel source]] for the energy comparisons.&lt;/ref&gt; Although antimatter is sometimes proposed as a source of energy, this does not appear feasible. Artificially producing antimatter—according to current understanding of the laws of physics—involves first converting energy into mass, which yields no net energy. Artificially created antimatter is only usable as a medium of energy storage, not as an energy source, unless future technological developments (contrary to the conservation of the [[baryon number]], such as a [[CP violation]] in favour of antimatter) allow the conversion of ordinary matter into anti-matter.  Theoretically, humans may in the future have the capability to cultivate and harvest a number of naturally occurring sources of antimatter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/08/110810-antimatter-belt-earth-trapped-pamela-space-science/ |title=Antimatter Found Orbiting Earth—A First |first=Ker |last= Than |work= [[National Geographic News]] |date=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1= Adriani | author2=Barbarino | author3=Bazilevskaya | author4=Bellotti | author5=Boezio | author6=Bogomolov | author7=Bongi | author8=Bonvicini | author9=Borisov | title=The discovery of geomagnetically trapped cosmic ray antiprotons | doi=10.1088/2041-8205/736/1/L1 | date=2011 | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=736 | pages=L1 | issue= 29 | arxiv=1107.4882 |bibcode = 2011ApJ...736L...1H  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12158718 | work=[[BBC News]] | title= Antimatter caught streaming from thunderstorms on Earth |first=Jason|last=Palmer|date=2011-01-11|accessdate=2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Renewable energy]] through converting sunlight into electricity—either by using [[solar cell]]s and [[concentrating solar power]] or indirectly through [[biofuel]], [[wind power|wind]] and [[hydroelectric power]]. There is no known way for [[civilization|human civilization]] to use the equivalent of the Earth's total absorbed solar energy without completely coating the surface with human-made structures, which is not feasible with current technology.  However, if a civilization constructed very large [[space-based solar power]] [[satellite]]s, Type&amp;nbsp;I power levels might become achievable—these could convert sunlight to microwave power and beam that to collectors on Earth.

[[Image:Dyson Swarm - 2.png|thumb|right|Figure of a Dyson swarm surrounding a star]]

===Type&amp;nbsp;II civilization methods===
* Type II civilizations might use the same techniques employed by a Type I civilization, but applied to a large number of planets in a large number of planetary systems.
* A [[Dyson sphere]] or [[Dyson swarm]] and similar constructs are hypothetical [[megastructure]]s originally described by [[Freeman Dyson]] as a system of orbiting [[solar power satellite]]s meant to enclose a [[star]] completely and capture most or all of its energy output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

* [[Star lifting]] is a process where an advanced civilization could remove a substantial portion of a star's matter in a controlled manner for other uses.
* [[Antimatter]] is likely to be produced as an industrial [[byproduct]] of a number of [[megascale engineering]] processes (such as the aforementioned star lifting) and, therefore, could be recycled. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
* In [[star system|multiple-star systems]] of a sufficiently large number of stars, absorbing a small but significant fraction of the output of each individual star.

===Type III civilization methods===
* Type&amp;nbsp;III civilizations might use the same techniques employed by a Type&amp;nbsp;II civilization, but applied to all possible stars of one or more galaxies individually.&lt;ref name= "kardashev1984"&gt;[[Nikolai Kardashev|Kardashev, Nikolai]].

Dordrecht, D. Reidel Publishing Co., 1985, p. 497–504.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They may also be able to tap into the energy released from the [[supermassive black hole]]s which are believed to exist at the center of most galaxies.
* [[White holes]], if they exist, theoretically could provide large amounts of energy from collecting the matter propelling outwards.
* Capturing the energy of [[gamma-ray burst]]s is another theoretically possible power source for a highly advanced civilization.
* The emissions from [[quasars]] can be readily compared to those of small active galaxies and could provide a massive power source if collectable.

==Civilization implications==
There are many historical examples of human civilization undergoing large-scale transitions, such as the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The transition between Kardashev scale levels could potentially represent similarly dramatic periods of social upheaval, since they entail surpassing the hard limits of the resources available in a civilization's existing territory. A common speculation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Excessive use of energy without adequate disposal of heat, for example, could plausibly make the planet of a civilization approaching Type&amp;nbsp;I unsuitable to the biology of the [[human|dominant life-forms]] and their food sources. If Earth is an example, then sea temperatures in excess of {{convert|35|C|F}} would jeopardize marine life and make the cooling of mammals to temperatures suitable for their [[metabolism]] difficult if not impossible. Of course, these [[theoretical]] speculations may not become problems possibly through the applications of future [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. Also, by the time a civilization reaches Type&amp;nbsp;I it may have colonized other planets or created [[O'Neill cylinder|O'Neill-type colonies]], so that waste heat could be distributed throughout the planetary system.

==Extensions to the original scale==
Many extensions and modifications to the Kardashev scale have been proposed.

* '''Types 0, IV, and V Kardashev rating:''' The most straightforward extension of the scale to even more hypothetical Type&amp;nbsp;IV beings who can control or use the entire universe or Type&amp;nbsp;V who control collections of universes. This would also include Type 0 civilizations, who do not rank on the Kardashev scale. The power output of the visible [[universe]] is within a few orders of magnitude of 10&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;W. Such a civilization approaches or surpasses the limits of speculation based on current scientific understanding, and may not be possible.
** Zoltán Galántai has argued that such a civilization could not be detected, as its activities would be indistinguishable from the workings of nature (there being nothing to compare them to).&lt;ref name = "Zoltan"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mono.eik.bme.hu/~galantai/longfuture/long_futures_article1.pdf| title=Long Futures and Type&amp;nbsp;Ⅳ Civilizations| format=PDF| first=Zoltán | last=Galántai| accessdate=2014-11-03| date=September 7, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Kardashev alternative rating characteristics:''' Other proposed changes to the scale use different metrics such as 'mastery' of systems, amount of information used, or progress in control of the very small as opposed to the very large.
* '''Planet mastery (Robert Zubrin):''' Metrics other than pure power usage have also been proposed. One is 'mastery' of a planet, system or galaxy rather than considering energy alone.&lt;ref name="Entering Space"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zubrin |first=Robert |date=1999 |title=Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization |isbn=978-1585420360}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Information mastery (Carl Sagan):''' Alternatively, [[Carl Sagan]] suggested adding another dimension in addition to pure energy usage: the information available to the civilization.
** He assigned the letter&amp;nbsp;A to represent 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; unique bits of information (less than any recorded human culture) and each successive letter to represent an order of magnitude increase, so that a level&amp;nbsp;Z civilization would have 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; bits.
** In this classification, 1973 Earth is a 0.7&amp;nbsp;H civilization, with access to 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; bits of information.
** Sagan believed that no civilization has yet reached level&amp;nbsp;Z, conjecturing that so much unique information would exceed that of all the intelligent species in a [[galactic supercluster]] and observing that the universe is not old enough to exchange information effectively over larger distances.
** The information and energy axes are not strictly interdependent, so that even a level Z civilization would not need to be Kardashev Type&amp;nbsp;III.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;
* '''Microdimensional mastery (John Barrow):''' [[John D. Barrow]], going by the fact that humans have found it more cost-effective to extend any abilities to manipulate their environment over increasingly smaller dimensions rather than increasingly larger ones, reverses the classification downward from Type&amp;nbsp;I-minus to Type Omega-minus:
** '''Type&amp;nbsp;I-minus''' is capable of manipulating objects over the scale of themselves: building structures, mining, joining and breaking solids;
** '''Type&amp;nbsp;II-minus''' is capable of manipulating genes and altering the development of living things, transplanting or replacing parts of themselves, reading and engineering their genetic code;
** '''Type&amp;nbsp;III-minus''' is capable of manipulating molecules and molecular bonds, creating new materials;
** '''Type&amp;nbsp;IV-minus''' is capable of manipulating individual atoms, creating nanotechnologies on the atomic scale and creating complex forms of artificial life;
** '''Type&amp;nbsp;V-minus''' is capable of manipulating the atomic nucleus and engineering the nucleons that compose it;
** '''Type&amp;nbsp;VI-minus''' is capable of manipulating the most elementary particles of matter (quarks and leptons) to create organized complexity among populations of elementary particles; culminating in:
** '''Type Omega-minus''' is capable of manipulating the basic structure of space and time.&lt;ref name="Impossibility: Limits of Science and the Science of Limits"&gt;{{cite book

**According to this scale, humans, having wide expertise in various branches of chemistry and biology, have passed the stage of Type III-minus. Type IV-minus technologies (that have had practical and widespread applications) have been seen in areas like [[nanotechnology]], [[semiconductors]], [[materials science]] and [[genetic engineering]], whereas Type V-minus has seen large scale application in the field and subfields of [[nuclear physics]]. Type VI-minus has had tentative research in the field of [[particle physics]] with particle colliders such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]].
* '''Civilizational range (Robert Zubrin):''' [[Robert Zubrin]] adapts the Kardashev scale to refer to how widespread a civilization is in space, rather than to its energy use.
** In his definition, a Type&amp;nbsp;I civilization has spread across its planet.
** A Type&amp;nbsp;II has extensive colonies in its respective stellar system, and
** A Type&amp;nbsp;III has colonized its galaxy.&lt;ref name="Entering Space"/&gt;

==Criticism==
It has been argued that, because we cannot understand advanced civilizations, we cannot predict their behavior.  Thus, the Kardashev scale may not be relevant or useful for classifying extraterrestrial civilizations. This central argument is found in the book ''[[Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life]]''.&lt;ref name="Cohen and Stewart"&gt;Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart: ''Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life'', Ebury Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-09-187927-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Klasies River Caves''' are a series of caves located to the east of the Klasies [[River delta|River mouth]] on the [[Tsitsikamma]] coast in the [[Humansdorp]] district of [[Eastern Cape Province]], South Africa. The three main caves and two shelters at the base of a high cliff have revealed evidence of [[middle stone age]]-associated human habitation from approximately 125,000 years ago. The {{convert|20|m}} thick deposits were accumulated from 125,000 years ago. Around 75,000 years ago, during cave remodelling, the stratigraphic sediments were moved out into external middens.

In 2015, the South African government submitted a proposal to add the caves to the list of [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Emergence of Modern Humans: The Pleistocene occupation sites of South Africa|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6050|website=UNESCO|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1960, [[Ronald Singer]], Ray Inskeep, [[John Wymer]], [[Hilary Deacon]], [[Richard Klein (anthropologist)|Richard Klein]] and others suggested the excavation yielded the earliest known evidence of  [[behaviourally modern humans]].&lt;ref name="Guide 5"&gt;{{cite web | title =Guide to Klasies River| year =  2001 | url = http://academic.sun.ac.za/archaeology/KRguide2001.PDF | author = Deacon, HJ | format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-03-04 | page= Pg. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Further analysis suggested that the specimens fall "outside the range of modern variation".&lt;ref name=Tattersall2006 &gt;{{Cite journal

==Morphology==
Analysis of 14 proximal [[ulna]]r dimensions compared to morphological properties of African archaic humans, and Levantine Mousterian, archaic European humans, west Asian and, European [[Upper Paleolithic]], African [[Epipaleolithic]] and recent modern human also of recent African descent suggest an archaic total morphological pattern for the KRM specimens. "MSA-associated humans from KRM may not be as modern as has been claimed from the craniofacial material"&lt;ref name=Churchill1966/&gt;

The hominin specimens include [[Human cranium|cranial]] fragments, [[human mandible|mandible]]s with teeth, and a few [[postcranial]] remains: [[ulna]] and five [[metatarsal]] bones.&lt;ref name=Tattersall2006/&gt;

== Evidence for behavioural modernity ==
There is a {{convert|20|m}} thick accumulation of deposits, both inside the caves and outside against the cliff face, proving that Klasies River Mouth people knew how to hunt small game, fish (later), gather plants and roots, cook{{Citation needed|reason=there is no pottery|date=June 2009}} by roasting on hearths, and manage their land (later). 
There is extensive evidence of shellfish collecting; [[middle stone age|MSA]] stone artefact technology;&lt;ref name="Guide 5"/&gt; gathering plants, roots and flowers for food; cooking plants, corms, seal, penguins, and antelope meat on hearths with fire;&lt;ref name="Guide 12"&gt;[http://archaeology.about.com/cs/humanorigins/a/klasiesriver.htm Klasies River Caves by K. Kris Hirst]. Retrieved 2007-03-04. Article&lt;/ref&gt; general organisation of the settlement; and land/veld management by fire.&lt;ref name="Guide 5"/&gt; 

The evidence also appears to indicate that their presence was seasonal or migratory. There is also evidence of [[cannibalism]], charred and carved 'modern human' bones discarded with other food remnants.&lt;ref name="Guide 10"&gt;{{cite web | title =Guide to Klasies River| year =  2001 | url = http://academic.sun.ac.za/archaeology/KRguide2001.PDF | author = Deacon, HJ | format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-03-04 | page= Pg. 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Middle Stone Age|Middle Stone Age (MSA)]] assemblage associated with those people are described as ''anatomically modern'', there is ongoing debate about when they were also ''behaviourally modern''.&lt;ref name="Guide 10"/&gt; There is a marked difference between the [[Paleolithic]] [[stone technology]] used in the earliest layers from 125,000 years ago, and the superior MST blades of the 70,000-year-old [[Howiesons Poort]] period that used raw material which had been 'mined' 20 kilometres inland. 
There is also a differentiation between the Paleolithic food detritus that accumulated underfoot inside the caves 125,000 years ago and the ejection of such detritus from the cave into external middens by the occupants of ca. 75,000 years ago, suggesting the development of rudimentary "houskeeping" by that time.&lt;ref name="Guide 12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guide 8"&gt;{{cite web | title =Guide to Klasies River| year =  2001 | url = http://academic.sun.ac.za/archaeology/KRguide2001.PDF | author = Deacon, HJ | format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-03-04 | page= Pg. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and excavation==
The artifacts and bones were originally reported by Paul Haslem and Ludwig Abel, then in 1960 Ray Inskeep and Ronald Singer identified the artifacts as [[Middle Stone Age]]. In 1967 and 1968 Ronald Singer and John Wymer started extensive excavations,&lt;ref name="Deacon1998"&gt;{{Cite book  | last= Deacon  | first= H.J.  | author-link =Hilary Deacon | chapter=  Elandsfontein and Klasies River revisited | pages=23–28| editor-last = Wymer  | editor-first = John | editor2-last = Ashton | editor2-first = Nick   | editor3-last = Pettitt | editor3-first = Paul |display-editors = 3 | editor4-last = Healy  | editor4-first = Frances | title = Stone Age Archaeology: Essays in honour of John Wymer | year = 1998 | publisher =   Oxbow Books | location = Oxford| isbn=1-900188-66-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wymer2008"&gt;{{cite web | title = The J J Wymer Archive| url = http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/archive/wymer_eh_2008/nb_browse.cfm?page=890| publisher= Archaeology Data Service| accessdate = 2010-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with their initial findings published in 1972 by the [[University of Chicago Press]].&lt;ref name="SingerWymer82"&gt;{{cite book | year =  1982 | title=  The Middle Stone Age at Klasies River Mouth in South Africa. | location=  Chicago | publisher= University of Chicago Press | isbn= 0-226-76103-7| author= Singer, R; [[John Wymer|Wymer, JJ]]. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1984 research has been continued by [[Hilary Deacon]].&lt;ref name="Guide 5"/&gt;

Retrieved 2011-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; is a termination of [[pregnancy]] that is performed during a later stage of pregnancy. Late termination of pregnancy is [[Abortion in the United States#By trimester of pregnancy|more controversial]] than abortion in general because it results in the death of a [[fetus]] that is more developed and sometimes [[fetal viability|able to survive independently]]. Given the complex, gradual nature of [[human fetal development]], the definition of "late" in this context is not precise, and different medical publications have discussed the varying [[gestational age]] points that can be involved.

==Definition==
A late termination of pregnancy often refers to an induced ending of pregnancy after the [[Gestational age|20th week]] of [[gestation]]. The exact point when a pregnancy becomes late-term, however, is not clearly defined. Some sources define an abortion after 16 weeks as "late".&lt;ref name="Torres"&gt;Torres, Aida and Forrest, Jacqueline Darroch. (1988).

Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weihe, Pál, Steuerwald, Ulrike,  Taheri, Sepideh, Færø, Odmar, Veyhe, Anna Sofía, &amp; Nicolajsen, Did. (2003).

Danish Ministry of Environment. Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Three articles published in 1998 in the same issue of the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' could not agree on the definition. Two of the ''JAMA'' articles chose the 20th week of gestation to be the point where an abortion procedure would be considered late-term.&lt;ref&gt;Sprang, M.L, and Neerhof, M.G. (1998). [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/280/8/744 Rationale for banning abortions late in pregnancy]. ''Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (8),'' 744-747.&lt;br /&gt;Grimes, D.A.

The point at which an abortion becomes late-term is often related to the "[[Fetus#Viability|viability]]" (ability to survive outside the [[uterus]]) of the [[fetus]]. Sometimes late-term abortions are referred to as post-viability abortions.

==Mental health==
While a single first-trimester abortion carried no more mental health risk than carrying a pregnancy to term, abortion could not be proven safe in other cases as far as mental health was concerned. Women who terminate a pregnancy because of abnormalities discovered through fetal screenings have a similar risk of negative mental health outcomes as women who miscarry a wanted pregnancy or experience a stillbirth or the death of a newborn. However, "the differing patterns of psychological experiences observed among women who terminate an unplanned pregnancy versus those who terminate a planned and wanted pregnancy highlight the importance of taking pregnancy intendedness and wantedness into account when seeking to understand psychological reactions to abortion."&lt;ref name="apa-2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/abortion/index.aspx | title = Mental Health and Abortion | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | year = 2008 | accessdate = April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons ==

===United States===
{{See also|Abortion in the United States#Reasons for abortions|l1=Reasons for abortions}}

A study from 2013 found that most women seeking late-term abortion "fit at least one of five profiles: They were raising children alone, were depressed or using illicit substances, were in conflict with a male partner or experiencing domestic violence, had trouble deciding and then had access problems, or were young and nulliparous."  The study data did not include any women who were having abortions "on grounds of fetal anomaly or life endangerment." The researchers concluded that "Bans on abortion after 20 weeks will disproportionately affect young women and women with limited financial resources."&lt;ref name=Foster2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Diana|title=Who Seeks Abortions at or After 20 Weeks?|journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|date=December 2013|volume=45|issue=4|pages=210–218|doi=10.1363/4521013|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4521013.html|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an earlier study published in 1987, the Alan Guttmacher Institute collected questionnaires from 1,900 women in the United States who came to clinics to have abortions. Of the 1,900 questioned, 420 had been pregnant for 16 or more weeks. These 420 women were asked to choose among a list of reasons they had not obtained the abortions earlier in their pregnancies.  The results were as follows:&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;
* 71% of women were unaware they were pregnant or misjudged gestation
* 48% of women found it hard to make arrangements for abortion
* 33% of women were afraid to tell their partner or parents
* 24% of women took longer to decide whether to have an abortion
* 8% of women had an abortion after a change in their relationship status
* 8% of women were initially pressured not to have abortion
* 6% of women chose to have an abortion because of a change in circumstances after becoming pregnant
* 6% of women were not properly educated on how timing affects abortion
* 5% of women were unaware that abortion was available to them
* 2% A fetal problem was diagnosed late in pregnancy
* 11% Other

=== England and Wales ===
The NHS records the reasons given for abortions at all stages of development. In 2015, 2,877 abortions were performed at 20 weeks or above. Of these, 23 (0.8%)&lt;!-- Ground A (alone, or with B, C, D) or F or G  --&gt; were performed to save the life of the pregnant woman, 1,801&lt;!-- C (alone) --&gt; (63%) were performed for mental or physical health reasons, and 1046&lt;!-- Ground E (alone, or with A, B, C or D)  --&gt; (36%) were performed because of foetal abnormalities. (The data do not sum up to 100% because multiple reasons could be recorded for each abortion.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/529344/Abortion_Statistics_2015_v3.pdf|title=Report on abortion statistics in England and Wales for 2015|last=Department of Health|first=|date=17 May 2016|issue=|doi=|volume=|page=31 (Table 7b)|pmid=|access-date=2016-10-24|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal restrictions==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Intact dilation and extraction]] --&gt;
As of 1998, among the 152 most populous countries, 54 either banned abortion entirely or permitted it only to save the life of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;Anika Rahman, Laura Katzive and Stanley K. Henshaw. [http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2405698.pdf A Global Review of Laws on Induced Abortion, 1985-1997], International Family Planning Perspectives (Volume 24, Number 2, June 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, 49 of the 152 most populous countries were without restriction as to reason, but 44 of these imposed limits after a particular [[gestational age]]:&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt;

* 12 weeks (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Georgia, Greece, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Rep., Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Norway, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Ukraine, Tajikistan,  Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan)
* 13 weeks (Italy)
* 14 weeks (Austria, Cambodia, Germany, Hungary, and Romania)
* 18 weeks (Sweden)
* 24 weeks (Singapore)
* no limit (Canada, China, and North Korea)
* viability (Netherlands and to some extent the United States)

In these countries, abortions after the general gestational age limit are allowed only under restricted circumstances, which include, depending on country, risk to the woman's life, physical or mental health, fetal malformation, cases where the pregnancy was the result of rape, or poor socio-economic conditions. For instance, in Italy, abortion is allowed on request up until 90 days, after which it is allowed only if the pregnancy or childbirth pose a threat to the woman’s life, a risk to physical health of the woman, a risk to mental health of the woman; if there is a risk of fetal malformation; or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or other sexual crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ippfen.org/NR/rdonlyres/2EB28750-BA71-43F8-AE2A-8B55A275F86C/0/Abortion_legislation_Europe_Jan2007.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313162004/http://www.ippfen.org/NR/rdonlyres/2EB28750-BA71-43F8-AE2A-8B55A275F86C/0/Abortion_legislation_Europe_Jan2007.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark provides a wider range of reasons, including social and economic ones, which can be invoked by a woman who seeks an abortion after 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/population/abortion/Denmark.abo.htm|title=DENMARK|author=|date=|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortions at such stages must in general be approved by a doctor or a special committee, unlike early abortions which are performed on demand. The ease with which the doctor or the committee allows a late term abortion varies significantly by country, and is often influenced by the social and religious views prevalent in that region.

Some countries, like Canada, China (Mainland only) and Vietnam have no legal limit on when an abortion can be performed.&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act}}
The [[United States Supreme Court]] decisions on abortion, including ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'',  allow states to impose more restrictions on post-viability abortions than during the earlier stages of pregnancy.

As of December 2014, forty-two states had bans on late-term abortions that were not [[Facial challenge|facially]] unconstitutional under ''Roe v. Wade'' or [[enjoined]] by court order.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;Guttmacher Institute. (April 1, 2007).

Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' ruled that Congress may ban certain late-term abortion techniques, "both previability and postviability",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Annas|first1=George J.|title=The Supreme Court and Abortion Rights|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=24 May 2007|volume=2007|issue=356|pages=2201–2207|doi=10.1056/NEJMhle072595|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhle072595|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it had done in banning [[intact dilation and extraction]] with the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Warren M.|title=Did I violate the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2003/10/did_i_violate_the_partialbirth_abortion_ban.html|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=Slate.com|date=22 Oct 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court has held that bans must include exceptions for threats to the woman's life, physical health, and mental health, but four states allow late-term abortions only when the woman's life is at risk; four allow them when the woman's life or physical health is at risk, but use a definition of health that pro-choice organizations believe is impermissibly narrow.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  Note that just because a portion of a state's law is found to be unconstitutional does not mean that the entire law will be deemed unconstitutional: "[I]nvalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief," meaning the court could declare that only those parts of the law that are violative of the Constitution are invalid (declaratory relief), or that the court can prohibit the state from enforcing those portions of the law (injunctive relief).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/04-1144.html 546 U.S. 320] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteen states prohibit abortion after a certain number of weeks' gestation (usually 22 weeks from the last menstrual period).&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  The U.S. Supreme Court held in ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'' that a statute may create "a presumption of viability" after a certain number of weeks, in which case the physician must be given an opportunity to rebut the presumption by performing tests.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster v. Reproductive Health Services'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=492&amp;invol=490 492 U.S. 490] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Because this provision is not explicitly written into these state laws, as it was in the Missouri law examined in ''Webster'', pro-choice organizations believe that such a state law is unconstitutional, but only "to the extent that it prohibits pre-viability abortions".&lt;ref name="Delaware"&gt;NARAL Pro-Choice America. (2007). "[http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/choice-action-center/in_your_state/who-decides/state-profiles/delaware.html?templateName=lawdetails&amp;issueID=3&amp;ssumID=2516 Delaware]."  ''Who Decides? The Status of Women's Reproductive Rights in the United States.'' Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten states (although Florida's enforcement of such laws are under [[permanent injunction]]) require a second physician's approval before a late-term abortion can be performed.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  The U.S. Supreme Court struck down a requirement of "confirmation by two other physicians" (rather than one other physician) because "acquiescence by co-practitioners has no rational connection with a patient's needs and unduly infringes on the physician's right to practice".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=410&amp;invol=179 410 U.S. 179] (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-choice organizations, such as the [[Guttmacher Institute]], posit that some of these state laws are unconstitutional, based on these and other Supreme Court rulings, at least to the extent that these state laws require approval of a second or third physician.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;

Thirteen states have laws that require a second physician to be present during late-term abortion procedures in order to treat a fetus if born alive.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt; The Court has held that a doctor's right to practice is not infringed by requiring a second physician to be present at abortions performed after viability in order to assist in the case of a living fetus.&lt;ref&gt;''Planned Parenthood Ass'n v. Ashcroft'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/462/476/case.html 462 U.S. 476], 486-90 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
There are at least four medical procedures associated with late-term abortions:
* [[Dilation and evacuation]] (D&amp;E)
* Early [[labor induction]] (sometimes called "induction abortion")
* [[Intact dilation and extraction]] (IDX or D&amp;X), sometimes referred to as "[[Partial birth abortion#Partial-birth abortion|''partial-birth abortion'']]"

'''[[Linguistic rights]] in [[Europe]]''' are stated in '''[[constitution]]s''' which differ by country. These constitutions usually state the [[national language]] or [[official language]], and may or may not explicitly allow for other languages in the country. Most of the linguistic rights stated here are negative rights, which grant freedom of usage of own language and prevents discrimination based on language. Some countries do offer positive rights: for example provision of language education from State funds in Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Hungary, Moldova, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, and Ukraine.

==Definitions==
This higher-level cognition was given the label metacognition by American developmental psychologist [[John H. Flavell]] (1976).

The term metacognition literally means 'beyond cognition', and is used to indicate cognition about cognition, or more informally, thinking about thinking. Flavell defined metacognition as knowledge about cognition and control of cognition. For example, a person is engaging in metacognition if he notices that he is having more trouble learning A than B, or if it strikes him that he should double-check C before accepting it as fact. J. H. Flavell (1976, p.&amp;nbsp;232).  [[Andreas Demetriou]]'s theory (one of the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]]) used the term hypercognition to refer to self-monitoring, self-representation, and self-regulation processes, which are regarded as integral components of the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A., Efklides, A., &amp; Platsidou, M. (1993). The architecture and dynamics of developing mind: Experiential structuralism as a frame for unifying cognitive developmental theories. ''Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 58'', Serial Number 234.
&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, with his colleagues, he showed that these processes participate in general [[intelligence]], together with processing efficiency and reasoning, which have traditionally been considered to compose [[fluid intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 =Demetriou|first1 = A.|last2 = Kazi|first2 = S.|year = 2006|title = Self-awareness in g (with processing efficiency and reasoning)|url=|journal=Intelligence|volume = 34|issue =3|pages = 297–317|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2005.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metacognition also involves thinking about one's own thinking process such as study skills, memory capabilities, and the ability to monitor learning.  This concept needs to be explicitly taught along with content instruction.
Metacognitive knowledge is about one's own cognitive processes and the understanding of how to regulate those processes to maximize learning.

Some types of metacognitive knowledge would include:
* Content knowledge (declarative knowledge) which is understanding one's own capabilities, such as a student evaluating his/her own knowledge of a subject in a class. It is notable that not all metacognition is accurate. Studies have shown that students often mistake lack of effort with understanding in evaluating themselves and their overall knowledge of a concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://images.pearsonassessments.com/images/tmrs/metacognition_literature_review_final.pdf|title=Metacognition: A Literature Review|last=Lai|first=Emily|date=April 2011|website=Metacognition: A Literature Review PDF|format=PDF|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, greater confidence in having performed well  is associated with less accurate metacognitive judgment of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molenberghs|first=Pascal|last2=Trautwein|first2=Fynn-Mathis|last3=Böckler|first3=Anne|last4=Singer|first4=Tania|last5=Kanske|first5=Philipp|date=2016-12-01|title=Neural correlates of metacognitive ability and of feeling confident: a large-scale fMRI study|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume=11|issue=12|pages=1942–1951|doi=10.1093/scan/nsw093|issn=1749-5024|pmc=5141950|pmid=27445213}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Task knowledge (procedural knowledge), which is how one perceives the difficulty of a task which is the content, length, and the type of assignment. The study mentioned in Content knowledge also deals with a person's ability to evaluate the difficulty of a task related to their overall performance on the task. Again, the accuracy of this knowledge was skewed as students who thought their way was better/easier also seemed to perform worse on evaluations, while students who were rigorously and continually evaluated reported to not be as confident but still did better on initial evaluations.
* Strategic knowledge (conditional knowledge) which is one's own capability for using strategies to learn information. Young children are not particularly good at this; it is not until students are in upper elementary school that they begin to develop an understanding of effective strategies.
Metacognition is a general term encompassing the study of memory-monitoring and self-regulation, meta-reasoning, [[consciousness]]/[[awareness]] and auto-consciousness/[[self-awareness]]. In practice these capacities are used to regulate one's own cognition, to maximize one's potential to think, [[learning|learn]] and to the evaluation of proper [[ethics|ethical]]/[[Morality|moral rules]]. It can also lead to a reduction in response time for a given situation as a result of heightened awareness, and potentially reduce the time to complete problems or tasks.

In the domain of experimental psychology, an influential distinction in metacognition (proposed by T. O. Nelson &amp; L. Narens) is between Monitoring&amp;mdash;making judgments about the strength of one's memories&amp;mdash;and Control&amp;mdash;using those judgments to guide behavior (in particular, to guide study choices). Dunlosky, Serra, and Baker (2007) covered this distinction in a review of metamemory research that focused on how findings from this domain can be applied to other areas of applied research.

In the domain of [[cognitive neuroscience]], metacognitive monitoring and control has been viewed as a function of the [[prefrontal cortex]], which receives (monitors) sensory signals from other cortical regions and  implements control using feedback loops(see chapters by Schwartz &amp; Bacon and Shimamura, in Dunlosky &amp; Bjork, 2008).&lt;ref name="Dunlosky"/&gt;

Metacognition is studied in the domain of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[Scientific modelling|modelling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.artint.2005.10.009 | volume=169 | issue=2 | title=Metacognition in computation: A selected research review | journal=Artificial Intelligence | pages=104–141| year=2005 | last1=Cox | first1=Michael T. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is the domain of interest of emergent [[systemics]].

It has been used, albeit off the original definition, to describe one's own knowledge that we will die. Writers in the 1990s involved with the [[grunge]] music scene often used the term to describe self-awareness of mortality.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Components==
Metacognition is classified into three components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flavell|first=J.H.|title=Metacognition and cognitive monitoring. A new area of cognitive-development inquiry|journal=American Psychologist|year=1979|volume=34|pages=906–911|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.34.10.906|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Metacognitive knowledge'' (also called metacognitive awareness) is what individuals know about themselves and others as cognitive processors.
# ''Metacognitive regulation'' is the regulation of cognition and learning experiences through a set of activities that help people control their learning.
# ''Metacognitive experiences'' are those experiences that have something to do with the current, on-going cognitive endeavor.

Metacognition refers to a level of thinking that involves active control over the process of thinking that is used in learning situations.  Planning the way to approach a learning task, monitoring comprehension, and evaluating the progress towards the completion of a task: these are skills that are metacognitive in their nature.

Metacognition includes at least three different types of metacognitive awareness when considering metacognitive knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=J.E.|author2=Paris, S.G.|title=Children's metacognition about reading: Issues in definition, measurement, and instruction|journal=[[Educational Psychologist (journal)|Educational Psychologist]]|year=1987|volume=22|pages=225–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Declarative knowledge'': refers to knowledge about oneself as a learner and about what factors can influence one's performance.&lt;ref name="Schraw 1998 113–125"/&gt; Declarative knowledge can also be referred to as "world knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=W|author2=Artelt, C.|title=Metacognition and mathematics education|journal=ZDM Mathematics Education|year=2010|volume=42|issue=2|pages=149–161|doi=10.1007/s11858-010-0240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Procedural knowledge'': refers to knowledge about doing things. This type of knowledge is displayed as heuristics and strategies.&lt;ref name="Schraw 1998 113–125"/&gt; A high degree of procedural knowledge can allow individuals to perform tasks more automatically. This is achieved through a large variety of strategies that can be accessed more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pressley|first=M |author2=Borkowski, J.G. |author3=Schneider, W.|title=Cognitive strategies: Good strategy users coordinate metacognition and knowledge|journal=Annals of Child Development|year=1987|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Conditional knowledge'': refers to knowing when and why to use declarative and procedural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garner|first=R|title=When children and adults do not use learning strategies: Toward a theory of settings|journal=Review of Educational Research|year=1990|volume=60|pages=517–529|doi=10.3102/00346543060004517|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows students to allocate their resources when using strategies. This in turn allows the strategies to become more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=R.E.|title=Selective attention and prose learning: Theoretical and empirical research|journal=[[Educational Psychology Review]]|year=1992|volume=4|pages=345–391|doi=10.1007/BF01332144|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive regulation or "regulation of cognition" contains three skills that are essential.&lt;ref name="Schraw 1998 113–125"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=J.E.|author2=Paris, S.G.|title=Children's metacognition about reading: Issues in definition, measurement, and instruction|journal=Educational Psychologist|year=1987|volume=22|issue=3–4|pages=255–278|doi=10.1080/00461520.1987.9653052}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Planning'': refers to the appropriate selection of strategies and the correct allocation of resources that affect task performance.
# ''Monitoring'': refers to one's awareness of comprehension and task performance
# ''Evaluating'': refers to appraising the final product of a task and the efficiency at which the task was performed. This can include re-evaluating strategies that were used.

Similarly, maintaining motivation to see a task to completion is also a metacognitive skill. The ability to become aware of distracting stimuli &amp;ndash; both internal and external &amp;ndash; and sustain effort over time also involves metacognitive or [[executive functions]]. The theory that metacognition has a critical role to play in successful learning means it is important that it be demonstrated by both students and teachers.

Students who demonstrate a wide range of metacognitive skills perform better on exams and complete work more efficiently{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. They are self-regulated learners who utilize the "right tool for the job" and modify learning strategies and skills based on their awareness of effectiveness. Individuals with a high level of metacognitive knowledge and skill identify blocks to learning as early as possible and change "tools" or strategies to ensure goal attainment. Swanson (1990) found that metacognitive knowledge can compensate for IQ and lack of prior knowledge when comparing fifth and sixth grade students' problem solving. Students with a high-metacognition were reported to have used fewer strategies, but solved problems more effectively than low-metacognition students, regardless of IQ or prior knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swanson|first=H.L.|title=Influence of metacognitive knowledge and aptitude on problem solving|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1990|volume=82|pages=306–314|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.82.2.306|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study examining students who send text messages during college lectures, it was suggested that students with higher metacognitive abilities were less likely than other students to have their learning affected by using a mobile phone in class.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, L. D., Lim, A. F., Carrier, L. M., &amp; Cheever, N. A. (2011). An empirical examination of the educational impact of message-induced task switching in the classroom: Educational implications and strategies to enhance learning. Psicología Educativa, 17(2), 163-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.|[[Bertrand Russell]]}}
Metacognologists are aware of their own strengths and weaknesses, the nature of the task at hand, and available "tools" or skills. A broader repertoire of "tools" also assists in goal attainment. When "tools" are general, generic, and context independent, they are more likely to be useful in different types of learning situations.

Another distinction in metacognition is executive management and strategic knowledge. Executive management processes involve planning, monitoring, evaluating and revising one's own thinking processes and products. Strategic knowledge involves knowing ''what'' (factual or declarative knowledge), knowing ''when and why'' (conditional or contextual knowledge) and knowing ''how'' (procedural or methodological knowledge). Both executive management and strategic knowledge metacognition are needed to self-regulate one's own thinking and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, there is no distinction between domain-general and domain-specific metacognitive skills.  This means that metacognitive skills are domain-general in nature and there are no specific skills for certain subject areas. The metacognitive skills that are used to review an essay are the same as those that are used to verify an answer to a math question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gourgey|first=A.F.|title=Metacognition in basic skills instruction|journal=Instructional Science|year=1998|volume=26|pages=81–96|doi=10.1023/A:1003092414893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Metacognition ==
Although metacognition has thus far been discussed in relation to the self, recent research in the field has suggested that this view is overly restrictive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jost|first=J. T.|last2=Kruglanski|first2=A. W.|last3=Nelson|first3=T. O.|date=1998|title=Social metacognition: an expansionist review|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review: An Official Journal of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc|volume=2|issue=2|pages=137–154|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0202_6|issn=1088-8683|pmid=15647141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is argued that metacognition research should also include beliefs about others’ mental processes, the influence of culture on those beliefs, and on beliefs about ourselves. This “expansionist view” proposes that it is impossible to fully understand metacognition without considering the situational norms and cultural expectations that influence those same conceptions. This combination of social psychology and metacognition is referred to as social metacognition. 

Social metacognition can include ideas and perceptions that relate to [[social cognition]]. Additionally, social metacognition can include judging the cognition of others, such as judging the perceptions and emotional states of others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is in part because the process of judging others is similar to judging the self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, individuals have less information about the people they are judging; therefore, judging others tend to be more inaccurate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tullis|first=Jonathan G.|last2=Fraundorf|first2=Scott H.|date=2017-08|title=Predicting others' memory performance: The accuracy and bases of social metacognition|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=95|pages=124–137|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2017.03.003|issn=0749-596X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having similar cognitions can buffer against this inaccuracy and can be helpful for teams or organizations, as well as interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thompson|first=Leigh|last2=Cohen|first2=Taya R.|date=2012-01-01|title=Metacognition in teams and organizations|url=https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/metacognition-in-teams-and-organizations-2|journal=Social Metacognition|pages=283–302|doi=10.4324/9780203865989|isbn=9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social Metacognition and the Self Concept ===
The self concept plays an important part in how people think about and act in their social worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scirp.org/(S(351jmbntvnsjt1aadkposzje))/reference/ReferencesPapers.aspx?ReferenceID=424661|title=Baumeister, R. F. (1998). The self. In D. T. Gilbert, S. T. Fiske, &amp; G. Lindzey (Eds.), The handbook of social psychology (4th ed., Vol. 1, pp. 635-679). Boston, MA McGraw-Hill Co., Inc. - References - Scientific Research Publishing|last=|first=|date=|website=www.scirp.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metacognitions can be divided into first order and second order thoughts. First order thoughts are the person’s first appraisal of a given thought (I am smart), while second order thoughts are their reflections about their certainty of that appraisal (I am not really sure how smart I am). These secondary cognitions are subject to the influence of culture and situational norms, and thus influence the strength of our self-convictions.

An example of the interaction between social metacognition and self-concept can be found in examining implicit theories about the self. Implicit theories can cover a wide-range of constructs about how the self operates, but two are especially relevant here; entity theory and incrementalist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dweck|first=Carol S.|last2=Chiu|first2=Chi-yue|last3=Hong|first3=Ying-yi|date=1995-10|title=Implicit Theories and Their Role in Judgments and Reactions: A Word From Two Perspectives|journal=Psychological Inquiry|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=267–285|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0604_1|issn=1047-840X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entity theory proposes that an individual’s self-attributes and abilities are fixed and stable, while incrementalist theory proposes that these same constructs can be changed through effort and experience. Entity theorists are susceptible to learned helplessness because they may feel that circumstances are outside their control (i.e. there’s nothing that could have been done to make things better), thus they may give up easily. Incremental theorists react differently when faced with failure: they desire to master challenges, and therefore adopt a mastery-oriented pattern.  They immediately began to consider various ways that they could approach the task differently, and they increase their efforts. Cultural beliefs can act on this as well. For example, a person who has accepted a cultural belief that memory loss is an unavoidable consequence of old age may avoid cognitively demanding tasks as they age, thus accelerating cognitive decline.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=B.|last2=Langer|first2=E.|date=1994-6|title=Aging free from negative stereotypes: successful memory in China and among the American deaf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=66|issue=6|pages=989–997|issn=0022-3514|pmid=8046582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a female who is aware of the stereotype that purports that females are not good at mathematics may perform worse on tests of mathematical ability or avoid mathematics altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steele|first=Jennifer R.|last2=Ambady|first2=Nalini|date=2006-07|title="Math is Hard!"

=== Attitudes as a Function of Social Metacognition ===
The way that individuals think about attitude greatly affects the way that they behave. Metacognitions about attitudes influence how individuals act, and especially how they interact with others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780203865989|title=Social Metacognition|last=Briñol|first=Pablo|date=2012-04-27|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780203865989|location=|pages=21–42|language=en|doi=10.4324/9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some metacognitive characteristics of attitudes include importance, certainty, and perceived knowledge, and they influence behavior in different ways.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Attitude importance is the strongest predictor of behavior and can predict information seeking behaviors in individuals. Attitude importance is also more likely to influence behavior than certainty of the attitude.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When considering a social behavior like voting a person may hold high importance but low certainty. This means that they will likely vote, even if they are unsure who to vote for. Meanwhile, a person who is very certain of who they want to vote for, may not actually vote if it is of low importance to them. This also applies to interpersonal relationships. A person might hold a lot of favorable knowledge about their family, but they may not maintain close relations with their family if it is of low importance.

Metacognitive characteristics of attitudes may be key to understanding how attitudes change. Research shows that the frequency of positive or negative thoughts is the biggest factor in attitude change.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780203865989|title=Social Metacognition|last=Briñol|first=Pablo|date=2012-04-27|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780203865989|location=|pages=43 – 62|language=en|doi=10.4324/9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person may believe that climate change is occurring but have negative thoughts toward it such as “If I accept the responsibilities of climate change, I must change my lifestyle.” These individuals would not likely change their behavior compared to someone that thinks positively about the same issue such as “By using less electricity, I will be helping the planet.”

Another way to increase the likelihood of behavior change is by influencing the source of the attitude. An individual’s personal thoughts and ideas have a much greater impact on the attitude compared ideas of others.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, when people view lifestyle changes as coming from themselves, the effects are more powerful than if the changes were coming from a friend or family member. These thoughts can be re-framed that emphasizes personal importance, such as “I want to stop smoking because it is important to me” rather than “quitting smoking is important to my family”. More research needs to be conducted on culture differences and importance of group ideology, which may alter these results.

=== Social Metacognition and Stereotypes ===
People have secondary cognitions about the appropriateness, justifiability, and social judgability of their own stereotypic beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Metacognition|last=Briñol|first=Pablo|date=2012-04-27|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780203865989|location=|pages=243–262|language=en|doi=10.4324/9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt; People know that it is typically unacceptable to make stereotypical judgments and make conscious efforts not to do so. Subtle social cues can influence these conscious efforts. For example, when given a false sense of confidence about their ability to judge others, people will return to relying on social stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yzerbyt|first=Vincent Y.|last2=Schadron|first2=Georges|last3=Leyens|first3=Jacques-Philippe|last4=Rocher|first4=Stephan|date=1994|title=Social judgeability: The impact of meta-informational cues on the use of stereotypes.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=66|issue=1|pages=48–55|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.1.48|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural backgrounds influence social metacognitive assumptions, including stereotypes. For example, cultures without the stereotype that memory declines with old age display no age differences in memory performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When it comes to making judgments about other people, implicit theories about the stability versus malleability of human characteristics predict differences in social stereotyping as well. Holding an entity theory of traits increases the tendency for people to see similarity among group members and utilize stereotyped judgments. For example, compared to those holding incremental beliefs, people who hold entity beliefs of traits use more stereotypical trait judgments of ethnic and occupational groups as well as form more extreme trait judgments of new groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plaks|first=Jason E.|last2=Stroessner|first2=Steven J.|last3=Dweck|first3=Carol S.|last4=Sherman|first4=Jeffrey W.|date=2001|title=Person theories and attention allocation: Preferences for stereotypic versus counterstereotypic information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=80|issue=6|pages=876–893|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.6.876|issn=1939-1315|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/7sb722b1|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; When individual’s assumptions about a group combine with their implicit theories, more stereotypical judgments may be form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yzerbyt|first=Vincent|last2=Corneille|first2=Olivier|last3=Estrada|first3=Claudia|date=2001-05|title=The Interplay of Subjective Essentialism and Entitativity in the Formation of Stereotypes|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=141–155|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0502_5|issn=1088-8683|citeseerx=10.1.1.379.4076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes that one believes others hold about them are called metastereotypes.

==Relation to sapience==
Metacognologists believe that the ability to consciously think about thinking is unique to [[sapience|sapient]] species and indeed is one of the definitions of sapience.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} There is evidence that [[Rhesus macaque|rhesus monkeys]], apes, and dolphins can make accurate judgments about the strengths of their memories of fact and monitor their own uncertainty,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1037/a0020129|last = Couchman|first = Justin J.|author2=Coutinho, M.

==Strategies==
Metacognitive-like processes are especially ubiquitous when it comes to the discussion of [[self-regulated learning]]. Being engaged in metacognition is a salient feature of good self-regulated learners.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Reinforcing collective discussion of metacognition is a salient feature of self-critical and self-regulating social groups.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  The activities of strategy selection and application include those concerned with an ongoing attempt to plan, check, monitor, select, revise, evaluate, etc.

Metacognition is 'stable' in that learners' initial decisions derive from the pertinent facts about their cognition through years of learning experience. Simultaneously, it is also 'situated' in the sense that it depends on learners' familiarity with the task, motivation, emotion, and so forth. Individuals need to regulate their thoughts about the strategy they are using and adjust it based on the situation to which the strategy is being applied.  At a professional level, this has led to emphasis on the development of [[reflective practice]], particularly in the education and health-care professions.

Recently, the notion has been applied to the study of second language learners in the field of [[English as a foreign or second language|TESOL]] and [[applied linguistics]] in general (e.g., Wenden, 1987; Zhang, 2001, 2010). This new development has been much related to Flavell (1979), where the notion of metacognition is elaborated within a tripartite theoretical framework. Learner metacognition is defined and investigated by examining their person knowledge, task knowledge and strategy knowledge.

Wenden (1991) has proposed and used this framework and Zhang (2001) has adopted this approach and investigated second language learners' metacognition or metacognitive knowledge. In addition to exploring the relationships between learner metacognition and performance, researchers are also interested in the effects of metacognitively-oriented strategic instruction on reading comprehension (e.g., Garner, 1994, in first language contexts, and Chamot, 2005; Zhang, 2010). The efforts are aimed at developing [[learner autonomy]], [[interdependence]] and [[Self-regulated learning|self-regulation]].

Metacognition helps people to perform many cognitive tasks more effectively.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt; Strategies for promoting metacognition include self-questioning (e.g. "What do I already know about this topic? How have I solved problems like this before?"), thinking aloud while performing a task, and making graphic representations (e.g. concept maps, flow charts, semantic webs) of one's thoughts and knowledge.  Carr, 2002, argues that the physical act of writing plays a large part in the development of metacognitive skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gammil | first1 = D. | year = 2006 | title = Learning the Write Way | url = | journal = The Reading Teacher | volume = 59 | issue = 8| pages = 754–762 | doi = 10.1598/RT.59.8.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategy Evaluation matrices (SEM) can help to improve the ''knowledge of cognition'' component of metacognition.  The SEM works by identifying the declarative (Column 1), procedural (Column 2) and conditional (Column 3 and 4) knowledge about specific strategies.  The SEM can help individuals identify the strength and weaknesses about certain strategies as well as introduce them to new strategies that they can add to their repertoire.&lt;ref name="Schraw1998a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schraw|first=Gregory|title=Promoting general metacogntive awareness|journal=Instructional Science|year=1998|volume=26|pages=113–125|doi=10.1023/A:1003044231033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A regulation checklist (RC) is a useful strategy for improving the regulation of cognition aspect of one's metacognition. RCs help individuals to implement a sequence of thoughts that allow them to go over their own metacognition.&lt;ref name="Schraw1998a"/&gt; King (1991) found that fifth-grade students who used a regulation checklist outperformed control students when looking at a variety of questions including written problem solving, asking strategic questions, and elaborating information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=A|title=Effects of training in strategic questioning on children's problem solving performance|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1991|volume=83|pages=307–317|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.83.3.307|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of strategies that can be taught to students are word analysis skills, active reading strategies, listening skills, organizational skills and creating mnemonic devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=L|author2=Thompson, M.|title=Neurofeedback combined with training in metacognitive strategies: Effectiveness in students with ADD|journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback|year=1998|volume=23|issue=4|pages=243–63|doi=10.1023/A:1022213731956|pmid=10457815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker and Walker have developed a model of metacognition in school learning termed [[Steering cognition|Steering Cognition]].  [[Steering cognition|Steering Cognition]] describes the capacity of the mind to exert conscious control over its reasoning and processing strategies in relation to the external learning task. Studies have shown that pupils with an ability to exert metacognitive regulation over their attentional and reasoning strategies used when engaged in maths, and then shift those strategies when engaged in science or then English literature learning, associate with higher academic outcomes at secondary school.

==Metastrategic knowledge==
"Metastrategic knowledge" (MSK) is a sub-component of metacognition that is defined as general knowledge about higher order thinking strategies. MSK had been defined as "general knowledge about the cognitive procedures that are being manipulated". The knowledge involved in MSK consists of "making generalizations and drawing rules regarding a thinking strategy" and of "naming" the thinking strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, A., &amp; Ben David, A. (2009). Paving a clear path in a thick forest: A conceptual analysis of a metacognitive component. Metacognition And Learning, 4(3), 177-195. {{DOI|10.1007/s11409-009-9044-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The important conscious act of a metastrategic strategy is the "conscious" awareness that one is performing a form of higher order thinking. MSK is an awareness of the type of thinking strategies being used in specific instances and it consists of the following abilities: making generalizations and drawing rules regarding a thinking strategy, naming the thinking strategy, explaining when, why and how such a thinking strategy should be used, when it should not be used, what are the disadvantages of not using appropriate strategies, and what task characteristics call for the use of the strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Veenman, M. V. J. (2006). Metacognition: Definitions, constituents, and their intricate relation with cognition. Symposium organized by Marcel V. J. Veenman, Anat Zohar, and Anastasia Efklides for the 2nd conference of the EARLI SIG on Metacognition (SIG 16), Cambridge, UK, 19–21 July.&lt;/ref&gt;

MSK deals with the broader picture of the conceptual problem. It creates rules to describe and understand the physical world around the people who utilize these processes called [[higher-order thinking]]. This is the capability of the individual to take apart complex problems in order to understand the components in problem. These are the building blocks to understanding the "big picture" (of the main problem) through reflection and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, N., &amp; Moneta, G. B. (2012). Coping and perceived stress as a function of positive metacognitions and positive meta-emotions. Individual Differences Research, 10(2), 105–116.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Action==

Both social and cognitive dimensions of sporting expertise can be adequately explained from a metacognitive perspective according to recent research. The potential of metacognitive inferences and domain-general skills including psychological skills training  are  integral to the genesis of expert performance. Moreover, the contribution of both mental imagery (e.g., mental practice) and attentional strategies (e.g., routines) to our understanding of expertise and metacognition is noteworthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacIntyre | first1 = TE | last2 = Igou | first2 = ER | last3 = Campbell | first3 = MJ | last4 = Moran | first4 = AP | last5 = Matthews | first5 = J | year = 2014 | title = Metacognition and action: a new pathway to understanding social and cognitive aspects of expertise in sport | url = | journal = Front.

The potential of metacognition to illuminate our understanding of action was first highlighted by Aidan Moran who discussed the role of meta-attention in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Moran A. P. (1996). The Psychology of Concentration in Sport Performers: A Cognitive Analysis. Hove, East Sussex: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; A recent research initiative,  a research seminar series called [http://www.meta-research.org META] funded by the [[British Psychological Society|BPS]], is exploring the role of the related constructs of meta-motivation, meta-emotion, and thinking and action (metacognition).

==Mental illness==

===Sparks of interest===
In the context of mental health, metacognition can be loosely defined as the process that "reinforces one's subjective sense of being a self and allows for becoming aware that some of one's thoughts and feelings are symptoms of an illness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lysaker, P. H.|author2=Dimaggio, G.|author3=Buck, K. D.|author4=Callaway, S.

Metacognition brings many unique insights into the normal daily functioning of a human being. It also demonstrates that a lack of these insights compromises 'normal' functioning. This leads to less healthy functioning. In the [[autism]] spectrum, there is a profound deficit in [[Theory of Mind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lysaker, P. H.|author2= Dimaggio, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Metacognitive disturbances in people with severe mental illness: Theory, correlates with psychopathology and models of psychotherapy|journal=Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice|volume=84|issue=1|pages= 1–8|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8341.2010.02007.x|pmid=22903827}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In people who identify as alcoholics, there is a belief that the need to control cognitions is an independent predictor of alcohol use over anxiety. Alcohol may be used as a coping strategy for controlling unwanted thoughts and emotions formed by negative perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spada | first1 = M.

===Implications===

Wells' and Matthews'&lt;ref&gt;Wells, A. &amp; Mathews, G. (1997). Attention and Emotion. A clinical perspective. Hove, UK: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; theory proposes that when faced with an undesired choice, an individual can operate in two distinct modes: "object" and "metacognitive". Object mode interprets perceived stimuli as truth, where metacognitive mode understands thoughts as cues that have to be weighted and evaluated. They are not as easily trusted. There are targeted interventions unique of each patient, that gives rise to the belief that assistance in increasing metacognition in people diagnosed with schizophrenia is possible through tailored psychotherapy. With a customized therapy in place clients then have the potential to develop greater ability to engage in complex self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lysaker | first1 = P. H. | last2 = Buck | first2 = K. D. | last3 = Carcione | first3 = A. | last4 = Procacci | first4 = M. | last5 = Salvatore | first5 = G. | last6 = Nicolò | first6 = G. | last7 = Dimaggio | first7 = G. | year = 2011 | title = Addressing metacognitive capacity for self-reflection in the psychotherapy for schizophrenia: A conceptual model of the key tasks and processes | url = | journal = Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice | volume = 84 | issue = 1| pages = 58–69 | doi=10.1348/147608310X520436 | pmid=22903831 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can ultimately be pivotal in the patient's recovery process. In the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]], cognitive formulations have greater attention to intrusive thoughts related to the disorder. "Cognitive self-consciousness" are the tendencies to focus attention on thought. Patients with OCD exemplify varying degrees of these "intrusive thoughts". Patients also suffering from [[generalized anxiety disorder]] also show negative thought process in their cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobi | first1 = D.

Cognitive-attentional syndrome (CAS) characterizes a metacognitive model of emotion disorder (CAS is consistent with the attention strategy of excessively focusing on the source of a threat). This ultimately develops through the client's own beliefs. [[Metacognitive therapy]] attempts to correct this change in the CAS. One of the techniques in this model is called attention training (ATT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = A | year = 1990 | title = Panic disorder in association with relaxation-induced anxiety: An attentional training approach to treatment | url = | journal = Behaviour Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 273–280 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(05)80330-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to diminish the worry and anxiety by a sense of control and cognitive awareness. ATT also trains clients to detect threats and test how controllable reality appears to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = A. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = P. | last3 = Myers | first3 = S. | last4 = Wheatley | first4 = J. | last5 = Patel | first5 = T. | last6 = Brewin | first6 = C.

==Works of art as metacognitive artifacts==
The concept of metacognition has also been applied to [[reader-response criticism]]. [[Narrative]] [[Work of art|works of art]], including novels, movies and musical compositions, can be characterized as metacognitive [[Cultural artifact|artifact]]s which are designed by the artist to anticipate and regulate the beliefs and cognitive processes of the recipient,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Lång, Markus | title=Teksti metakognitiivisena artefaktina: Sanataiteen ja säveltaiteen ontologiaa | journal=Synteesi | volume=17 | issue=4 | year=1998 | pages=82–94 | issn=0359-5242 | url=http://www.mlang.name/metakognitio.html | language=Finnish |trans-title=Text as a Metacognitive Artifact: Literary and Musical Ontology }}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Lång, Markus | title=Elokuva metakognitiivisena artefaktina: Reseptioesteettinen katsaus | journal=Synteesi | volume=21 | issue=1 | year=2002 | pages=59–65 | issn=0359-5242 | url=http://www.mlang.name/elokuva.html | language=Finnish |trans-title=Film as a metacognitive artifact: Reader-response critical review }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, how and in which order events and their causes and identities are revealed to the reader of a detective story.

They are something of a tool with which the creators of the work wish to attain certain aesthetical and even moral effects.&lt;ref&gt;Lång 1998, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mind wandering==

There is an intimate, dynamic interplay between [[mind wandering]] and metacognition.

The '''Modern Greek Enlightenment''' ({{lang-el|Διαφωτισμός}}, ''Diafotismos'', "enlightenment," "illumination") was the Greek expression of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

==Origins==
{{further information|Ottoman Greece}}
The Greek Enlightenment was given impetus by the Greek predominance in trade and education in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Greek [[merchant]]s financed a large number of young Greeks to study in universities in [[Renaissance Italy|Italy]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire|German states]]. There they were introduced to the ideas of the Enlightenment and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=BritannicaA&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, Intellectual Revival'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the wealth of the extensive [[Greeks|Greek]] merchant class that provided the material basis for the intellectual revival that was the prominent feature of Greek life in the half century and more leading to 1821.  It was not by chance that on the eve of the [[Greek War of Independence]] the most important centres of Greek learning, schools-cum-universities, were situated in [[Ioannina]], [[Chios]], [[Smyrna]] (Izmir) and [[Ayvalik]], all major centres of Greek commerce.&lt;ref name=BritannicaB&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, The mercantile middle class'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the Phanariotes===
The [[Phanariotes]] were a small caste of Greek families who took their collective name from the [[Phanar]] quarter of [[Constantinople]] where the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]] is still housed. They held various administrative posts within the [[Ottoman Empire]], the most important of which were those of [[hospodar]], or prince, of the [[Danubian principalities]] of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. Most hospodars acted as patrons of Greek culture, education, and printing. These academies attracted teachers and pupils from throughout the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] commonwealth, and there was some contact with intellectual trends in [[Habsburg]] central Europe. For the most part they supported the Ottoman system of government, too much to play a significant part in the emergence of the Greek national movement; however, their support of learning produced many highly educated Greek scholars who benefited from the cosmopolitan environment the Phanariotes cultivated in their principalities.&lt;ref name=BritannicaC&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Greek history, Transformation toward emancipation, The Phanariotes'', 2008 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

This environment was in general a special attraction for young, ambitious and educated Greek people from the Ottoman Empire, contributing to their national enlightenment. The Princely Academies of [[Princely Academy of Bucharest|Bucharest]] and [[Princely Academy of Iaşi|Iasi]] also played a crucial role in this movement. Characteristically the authors of the ''[[Geographia Neoteriki]]'', one of the most remarkable works of that era, [[Daniel Philippidis]] and [[Grigorios Konstantas]], were both educated in this environment.&lt;ref name=Kopecek&gt;{{cite book |first=Michal |last=Kopeček |title= Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770–1945): texts and commentaries |language=|year=2006|pages= 73–79|ref= |isbn=978-963-7326-52-3| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k5Vsjg508EYC&amp;pg=PA74 |publisher=Central European University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Roland |last=Sussex |first2= Eade|last2= John Christopher|title=Culture and nationalism in nineteenth-century Eastern Europe |language=|year=1985|page= 8|ref= |isbn=978-0-89357-146-7| url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=oMYPTZOCG8eAswbmse30DA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=eQZpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Grigorios+Konstantas+in+their+New+Geography%22&amp;q=%22Daniil+Philippidis+and+Grigorios+Konstantas+in+their+New+Geography+of+1791%2C+one+of+the+most+remarkable+works+of+the+%27Neo-Hellenic+Enlightenment%27%2C+%22#search_anchor |publisher=Slavica Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

One effect was the creation of an [[Attic Greek|atticized]] form of Greek by linguistic purists, which was adopted as the official [[state language|language of the state]] and came to be known as ''[[Katharevousa]]'' (purified). This created [[diglossia]] in the Greek linguistic sphere, in which ''Katharevousa'' and the vernacular idiom known as [[Demotic Greek|''Dimotiki'']] were in conflict until the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BritannicaA/&gt;

The transmission of Enlightenment ideas into Greek thought also influenced the development of a national consciousness. The publication of the journal [[Hermes o Logios]] encouraged the ideas of the Enlightenment. The journal's objective was to advance Greek science, philosophy and culture.  Two of the main figures of the Greek Enlightenment, [[Rigas Feraios]] and [[Adamantios Korais]], encouraged Greek nationalists to pursue contemporary political thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= M. Kitromilides |first= Paschalis | title=The Dialectic of Intolerance: Ideological Dimensions of Ethnic Conflict | publisher=Journal of the Hellnice Diaspora | year=1979 | editor= |url= http://triceratops.brynmawr.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10066/5243/Kitromilides_6_4.pdf;jsessionid=D85E79913BFF8FCAF6D4228BE8B3CEAC?sequence=1 | isbn=  | page =4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek Enlightenment concerned not only language and the [[humanities]] but also the [[sciences]]. Some scholars such as [[Methodios Anthrakites]], [[Evgenios Voulgaris]], [[Athanasios Psalidas]], [[Balanos Vasilopoulos]] and [[Nikolaos Darbaris]] had a background in [[Mathematics]] and the [[Physical Sciences]] and published scientific books into Greek for use in Greek schools. [[Rigas Feraios]] also published an Anthology of Physics.

* [[Rigas Feraios]], Greek emigre to [[Vienna]]. He was an admirer of the [[French revolution]] and hoped to transplant its humanistic ideas to the Greek world. He imagined a pan-Balkan uprising against the Ottomans.
* [[Adamantios Korais]], witness of the [[French Revolution]], Korais took his primary intellectual inspiration from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and he borrowed ideas copiously from the philosophers [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].
* [[Theophilos Kairis]], influenced by the [[French Enlightenment]] and critical to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. He founded a pietistic revivalist movement, known as [[Theosebism]], inspired by the French revolutionary cults, radical Protestantism and deism which was [[anathema]]tised by the Synod of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. He had a very different vision for the independent Greece, one that was based upon the concept of separation of church and state.
* [[Theoklitos Farmakidis]], inspired by the [[French Revolution]], strongly pro-West and critical to the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]].
* [[Filomousos Eteria]], the name of two (Athens and Vienna) philological and philellene organizations.
* [[Filiki Eteria]], the ''Society of Friends'' in Greek, was a secret organisation working in the early 19th century, whose purpose was to overthrow [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule and to establish an independent Greek state founded on the humanist ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Many young [[Phanariot]] Greeks were among its members.

The '''National Women's Front''' (NWF) was formed in 2009 with the stated objective of [[Women's empowerment|empowerment of women]] of [[India]]. In the view of the NWF, "the world's largest [[democracy]] still has women [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] and [[Oppression|oppressed]]". The NWF seeks to create a platform for Indian women to oppose [[injustice]] and claim their [[Women's rights|rights]].

== Background ==
{{See also|Women in India}}
The status of Indian women is progressing towards gender equality, but women continue to encounter patriarchal standards. Despite the steps towards gender equality, women still face abuse from society. India has [[Rape in India|a high rate of rapes]], while physical assault and acid attacks are on the rise as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/07/27/acid-attacks-women-india-survivors-fight-back/486007001/|title=Acid Attacks on Women in India: Survivors Fight Back|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Women's Front was founded with the hope of empowering women in the fight for justice and equality. 

===History of the organization===
Although NGOs and humanitarian organizations lend support to women's rights in India, western approaches to feminism may not provide the relief necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Subramaniam, M. (2004). The Indian Women's Movement. ''Contemporary Sociology'', 33(6), 635–639. {{JSTOR|3593826}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2009, the National Women's Front was launched to "create a platform for women through which women can stand up against injustice and fight for their rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwfindia.com/home/content/about-nwf|title=The National Women's Front|work=NWFIndia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization started and worked in three states, but is now working within eight states. The aim is to provide support and encourage women living in rural communities that are often overlooked by the government to fight for their equality. 

== Programs and campaigns==
In 2014, the NWF [[Delhi]] State unit held an [[International Women's Day]] celebration with their nationwide campaign "Women Representation – The Power to Empower".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nwfindia.com/home/content/nwf%C2%A0organized-womens-march-india-gate|title=NWF Organized a women's march at India gate|work=nwfindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November of the same year, the NWF organised a conference ‘Awakening’ to debate issues concerning Indian women at [[Coimbatore]].&lt;ref name=deccan1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/141116/nation-current-affairs/article/women%E2%80%99s-conference-coimbatore-today|title=Women's conference in Coimbatore today|work=Deccan Chronicle| date = 2014-11-16 |access-date = 2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of the conference, an expo on [[women's rights]] and issues was inaugurated by [[Popular Front of India]] state president A.S.Ismail.  Graphic illustrations of [[domestic violence]], [[rape]], [[Sex-selective abortion|female foeticide]] and [[riot]]s victims have been presented at the expo.&lt;ref name=deccan1 /&gt;

A workshop on Women Safety was organized by the National Women's Front at the India Islamic Cultural Center in [[New Delhi]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://twocircles.net/2013feb18/national_womens_front_organizes_workshop_women.html#.VyoOVIR97cc | title = NWF organizes workshop for women | newspaper = TCN News | date = 2013-02-18 | access-date = 2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September of the same year National Women's Front organized the national campaign "Right to Hijab" across the country to create awareness about [[hijab]] and also promote the right to [[cultural identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Right to Hijab|url=http://www.nwfindia.com/home/content/right-hijab|website=National Women's Front}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

NWF conducted a campaign related to [[human rights]] and [[legal awareness]] in various States of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights|url=http://nwfindia.com/home/content/human-rights|website=nwfindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign sprang from a perception that, under the garb of preventing [[terrorism]], [[extremism]], and [[Maoism]], law enforcement targets [[Minority group|minorities]], [[dalit]]s, and [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|tribals]] by taking them into illegal custody, keeping them in jail, and even killing them in fake encounters, and that none of the [[List of political parties in India|political parties]] were taking a principled stand against what NWF regarded as this injustice. 

The [[Kerala]] State committee of National Women's Front organized a campaign against the [[Uniform Civil Code]], as a part of national level of initiative to create awareness of the threat posed by the Code to the [[cultural diversity]] of India.&lt;ref name=hindu1&gt;{{cite news|title=National Women's Front opposes Uniform Civil Code|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/Women%E2%80%99s-front-opposes-Uniform-Civil-Code/article16088802.ece|accessdate=2016-12-02|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; They termed the Uniform Civil Code "anti-national" as it eliminates the diversity of different communities ultimately destroying [[Indian Nationalism]].&lt;ref name=hindu1 /&gt; According to them it is a manifestation of [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Muslim]] and anti-dalit tendencies of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]].&lt;ref name=hindu1 /&gt;

==Condemnation of the arrest of Irom Chanu Sharmila==
[[Irom Chanu Sharmila]] has been [[fasting]] since 2000 demanding the withdrawal of [[Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act|Armed Forces Special Powers Act]] (AFSPA) imposed in [[Manipur]]. The arrest of Irom Chanu Sharmila, after the release order from the [[Imphal]] [[Sessions Court]], was condemned by the NWF national secretariat members who gathered a meeting in their headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.nwfindia.com/home/news?page=4 | title = NWF strongly condemns the arrest of irom sharmila | date = 2014-10-16 | access-date = 2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Irom Chanu Sharmila called an end to her 16 long year fast to enter politics, she received a negative response from the people of Manipur itself. But NWF supported her decision in this cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Women's Front appreciates Irom Sharmila's initiative|url=http://www.popularfrontindia.org/?q=sat-08132016-1407|website=Popular Front of India|accessdate=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NWF president AS Sainaba strongly condemned the disgraceful attack on Muslim women at the [[Mandsaur]] railway station in Madhya Pradesh. It was an attack of cow protection vigilantes. She called for an end to violence, for the culprits to be brought to justice, and for the Government to control hate speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=control hindutwa vigilante|url=http://www.popularfrontindia.org/?q=sat-08132016-1414|website=Popular Front of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Polka-Dot Puss''''' is a 1949 one-reel [[animated cartoon]] and the 39th ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' short produced in 1948 and released on February 26, 1949 and re-released on September 28, 1956. The short was directed by Tom and Jerry's creators, [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]], produced by [[Fred Quimby]], animated by Kenneth Muse, Ed Barge, [[Ray Patterson (animator)|Ray Patterson]] and Irven Spence, and scored by [[Scott Bradley (composer)|Scott Bradley]], with this cartoon featuring an early version of the duo's iconic theme tune that would continue to be used in their cartoons throughout the 1950s and 1960s and in most direct-to-video films.

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=February 2010}}
Tom is using Jerry as a [[yo-yo]]. Tom then hears [[Mammy-Two-Shoes]] telling him that it is time to put him out for the night. Noticing that the weather outside is rather unpleasant, and hearing Mammy say that if she stood in the draft she'd "catch her death of cold", Tom craftily fakes a cold, pretending to sneeze violently. Mammy asks if Tom has a cold. Tom nods and sneezes again. Mammy has a change of heart and allows Tom to sleep inside for the night, but gives the cat a stern warning that she'd wash his mouth with soap if he was lying. Tom grabs an onlooking Jerry, who appropriately shoves a bar of soap in Tom's mouth. Tom spits out a multitude of soap bubbles and chases Jerry into his mousehole, but ends up with a mousetrap on his nose. When he takes it off, his nose rolls like a window shade.

Tom prepares to sleep on the living room floor, nose bandaged up. While Tom is asleep, Jerry enters the room with a small pot of red paint, painting several red spots on his face after removing the bandage on Tom's nose. When Tom wakes up, Jerry convinces him that he has measles, showing evidence of a nationwide measles epidemic in the newspaper, and producing a mirror, showing Tom his own spotty reflection and he screams.

Jerry consults Dr. Quack's medicine book and does a number of unorthodox treatments to the now hypochondriacal cat, such as placing a stethoscope next to a ticking alarm clock to intensify Tom's apparent heartbeat, and setting off the alarm shortly afterwards. Jerry then tests Tom's reflexes and pulls out a hammer, hitting it right in Tom's right knee, causing Tom to scream in pain as Jerry shoves a thermometer in Tom's mouth, holding a cigarette lighter underneath the thermometer, causing the temperature to rise, expanding the thermometer, such that it explodes.

The next chapter of the medical book urges Jerry to apply chills to Tom's high fever. Soon Tom is in the freezer, teeth chattering. Jerry unloads a spoonful of ice cubes onto Tom's body and puts a spoonful of ice cubes into his mouth, and then closes the freezer door for a few seconds. As he opens the door, a frozen-solid Tom slides out of the freezer. Jerry panics and looks at the following book's advice on extreme chills, then shoves Tom into the oven, turning it onto a low temperature. Opening the oven door, Tom is now conscious, but still very cold, and baking in his own juices and grease. Jerry pours some juice and grease over Tom and then closes the door, adjusting the oven's temperature. When he opens the door again, Tom is bright red and burning. Jerry quickly touches the hot cat and burns himself. Thinking quickly, he places Tom onto a baking tray and heads for the bathroom, giving him a cold shower.

Tom later emerges from the shower, covered in towels and using hot-water bottles as sandals. He observes himself in the mirror and notices that most of his spots have gone. As he wipes his forehead, the final two spots are removed and transferred to his paw. Just then, Tom sees a small jar of red paint hidden in the corner, while Jerry puts the book down and tip-toes from him. Tom paints three spots on his head, and realization dawns on him; his mirror image changes to a [[donkey]] jackass. Tom becomes furious after realizing that he has been pranked the whole time and he runs to the living room, where he grabs a sword, ready to get back at Jerry. Tom finds the mouse sitting hunched-up with head in hands, looking very depressed somehow, and he only blinks at Tom apathetically when prodded with the sword's keen point. Only when Tom snatches him up does Jerry break out in genuine measles spots, which proliferate before Tom's horrified gaze. Tom quickly dashes to the bathroom and washes his hands, and then doses himself frantically with everything he can find from the medicine cabinet (throat sprays, pills, mouthwash, nasal drops, etc., but little does he know that there is no cure for measles), while a sped-up version of [[George Frideric Handel]]'s ''[[Dead March (Handel)|Death March]]'' plays over.

By the end, both the cat and mouse are covered in spots from head to foot and are being quarantined by Mammy Two Shoes herself. Tom pouts and glares at Jerry for making him get measles. Then Jerry holds up a mirror, looks into it and sticks out his tongue, which, too, is covered in spots, and may also imply that Jerry got a more severe case of the measles than Tom did. He then puts the mirror down and leans by the window on the windowsill.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1318">'''Rice-hull bagwall''' construction is a system of [[building]], with results [[aesthetic]]ally similar to the use of [[Earthbag construction|earthbag]] or [[Cob (building)|cob]] construction. Woven [[polypropylene]] bags (or tubes) are tightly filled with raw [[rice-hulls]], and these are stacked up, layer upon layer, with strands of four-pronged [[barbed wire]] between.  A surrounding "cage" composed of mats of welded or [[chicken wire|woven steel]] mesh (remesh or "poultry wire") on both sides (wired together between bag layers with, for example, rebar tie-wire) and then [[stucco]]ed, to form building walls. 
&lt;p&gt;
Advantages (compared to earth-bag or cob) include less weight to handle/process, far better insulation values (around 3 - 4 per inch), use of an [[agricultural]]-waste product and the sequestration of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. This building approach was originally innovated and tested by Don Stephens, in the northwestern U.S. in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/projects/ricehullstudio.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12463">'''Self access language learning centers''' are educational facilities designed for student learning that is at least partially, if not fully self-directed.  Students have access to resources ranging from photocopied exercises with answer keys to computer software for language learning. These centers are an outgrowth of a style of learning that can go by several names: [[Student-centred learning|learner-centered approach]], [[learner autonomy]] or [[self-directed learning]].  These centers exist primarily in [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Use of such facilities and the pedagogical theory they are based upon has its advantages and disadvantages. Proper use can result in a feeling of empowerment and better learning outcomes, but getting to the point where students and teachers can exploit them effectively can be problematic. For this reason, the structure of established self access centers varies from completely student-directed work with classroom immersion to programs that provide primarily tutor or instructor guidance for student work.

==Definition==
Self access language learning promotes the approach where students study independently choosing from among different resources that are available.  The theory behind this style of learning is that students, especially foreign language students, learn better if they have a say in how they learn.&lt;ref name="Klassen"&gt;{{cite web |first=Johanna |last=Klassen |year=1998 |title=Does Self-Access Language Learning at the Tertiary Level Really Work? |url=http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ajelt/vol8/art4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-access language learning is closely related to [[learner-centered approach]], [[learner autonomy]] and [[self-directed learning]] as all focus on student responsibility and active participation for his/her own learning.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Carter | first = Beverly-Anne | title = Begin with Beliefs: Exploring the Relationship between Beliefs and Learner Autonomy among Advanced Students | journal = Texas Papers in Foreign and Second Language Learning and Teaching | volume =4 | issue =1 | pages = 1–20 | date = Fall 1999 | id = ED 467863 (ERIC) }}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of instruction is most often done in the setting of a self-contained learning environment or self-access center.

Self-access centers can be as simple as a classroom set aside with dictionaries and shelves of paper-based exercises to state-of-the-art digital centers with various types of computer- and Internet-based resources. What resources are available and how students are guided to use them depend on the financial resources available and how much learner autonomy an institution decides to give students.&lt;ref name="Rodden"&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Rodden |year=2007 |title=Self-Access: A framework for diversity |url=http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/think/resources/self_access.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817093215/http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/think/resources/self_access.shtml |archivedate=2007-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of self-access centers===
*The Multimedia English Learning Center at the [[National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology]] in [[Taiwan]] has 60 computers, 2 service desks, 2 counseling rooms and discussion areas with sofas and tables. It is divided into two sections: a self-access program based on the university's [[intranet]] and self-directed learning materials available in the facility. It has 3 pedagogical goals: 1) to support English courses by reducing teacher workload 2) to make up for the limited time that large classes have for listening and speaking and 3) to foster autonomy and self-directive study strategies among students.&lt;ref name="Hsu"&gt;{{cite conference | first =Jeng-yih | last =Hsu | title =Integrating a Writing-across-curriculum Program into a Self-access Learning Center. | booktitle =Proceedings of the 24th Conference on English Teaching and Learning | publisher = ERIC 496122 | date =May 6, 2007 | location = Taiwan| accessdate =2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Language Learning Center at [[Offutt Air Force Base]], [[Nebraska]] United States offers holds classes in 10 different language and provides self-learning materials in 57 languages.  The center also has 22 computers with access to online language classes as well as a variety of self-paced learning materials.&lt;ref name="Singleton"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Singleton |first=Malinda |title=Continuous learning: new Language Learning Center enhances Air Force linguists skills. |journal=Spokesman Magazine |date=October 1, 2006 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-153518693.html |accessdate=2007-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===

===Advantages===
Some of the advantages of this form of learning is that students at the very least set the pace of their work.  Depending on the individual center, students can also set the level and content of their work.  Students can use these centers voluntarily or can have assignments to complete there.  The major advantage, therefore, is flexibility, with the purpose of giving the students themselves the opportunity to tailor the course more to their learning needs and styles than a more traditional mode of teaching.&lt;ref name="Klassen"/&gt;

Use of multiple technologies in a more independent setting has been shown to improve motivation and increase students’ ability to work independently by taking more responsibility for their own learning. Students also report feeling more “empowered” by such modes of instruction.&lt;ref name="Stepp"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stepp-Greany |first=Jonita |title=Student Perceptions On Language Learning in a Technological Environment: Implications for the New Millennium.  |journal=Language, Learning &amp; Technology  |date=January 1, 2002 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-82135559.html  |accessdate=2007-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
The major disadvantages of this mode has basically to do with the ability of both students and teachers to adapt and integrate this method effectively.  Many students are not used to working independently, creating the need to provide guidance as to the use of this kind of center, at least in the beginning.&lt;ref name="Klassen"/&gt; One study reports that students do not seem to want too much freedom in their use of technology.  73% reported that they preferred a regularly scheduled lab time, with the facilitative presence of a teacher. Significantly less than half reported that they preferred completely free access to the lab or to do work at home on their own computer.&lt;ref name="Stepp"/&gt;

For teachers, the 'letting go' of control can be equally disorienting and it may seem that giving students such control depreciates teachers' skills and experience.&lt;ref name="Rodden"/&gt; Traditionally, teachers are used to being the center of student activity, controlling how, when and why students do what they do. Students have been expected to work in "lock-step" with the teacher orchestrating what students do to a very high degree. Teachers, in turn, rely on textbooks that allow little variation.  Use of self-access center materials steer students way from the rigidity and "security" of this paradigm, causing teachers to lose their "all-powerful" and "all-knowing" position. This can cause problems integrating a self-access center due to political and institutional constraints.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Johnson | first = Frances |author2=Delarche, Marion |author3=Marshall, Nicholas |author4=Wurr, Adrian |author5=Edwards, Jeffrey | date = Spring 1998 | title = Changing Teachers Roles in the Foreign Language Classroom. | journal = Texas Papers in Foreign Language Education | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 71–89 | id = ED423 676 (ERIC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other possible problems have to do with availability of physical resources.&lt;ref name="Rodden"/&gt;

==Types==
;Fully Independent Learning'''
:In its most extreme form of self-directed learning, students set their own curriculum and goals, self-accessing their progress. Teachers function only as "counsellors" who give feedback after students evaluate their learning.&lt;ref name="Klassen"/&gt;

;Semi-Guided Learning
:To address problems with student use of self-access centers, some centers make tutors available to give academic and a kind of psychological support.  Students may or may not choose how self-directed or tutor-dependent they choose to be.  While the academic effectiveness of a semi-independent study course has not been proven, student response to such a scheme in Hong Kong was very positive.&lt;ref name="Lai"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lai |first=Lai Kwan |title= A Tutor-Guided Learning Scheme in a Self-Access Centre  |journal=The Internet TESL Journal  |date=September 1999 |url=http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ajelt/vol8/art4.htm  |accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Self-access center combined with English-language writing center'''
:In several universities in [[Taiwan]], several universities such as [[National Taiwan University]], [[Fu Jen Catholic University]] and [[National Sun Yat-Sen University]], have joined the two facilities. While the union of the two facilities has not proved to provide any benefits, the idea has been promoted as a way to enhance both general writing skills, which in turn support the acquisition of other language skills such as reading, speaking and listening.&lt;ref name="Hsu"/&gt;

;Online self-access learning
:Online self-access or online language support, is a type of self-access learning. In its most basic form, online self-access involves institutions making language learning materials available online to students. More elaborate forms include opportunities for supporting learners online (e.g. through advisory sessions), tools for collaborative learning, e-portfolios, and active monitoring of student performance by the software. Examples of such systems include the [[University of Auckland]]'s electronic learning environment &lt;ref name="elsac"&gt;{{cite web |title=English Language Self-Access Centre |url=http://www.elsac.auckland.ac.nz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327231345/http://www.elsac.auckland.ac.nz/ |archivedate=2008-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 'My English', developed at [[King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi]], in Bangkok, Thailand.&lt;ref name="My English"&gt;{{cite web |title=My English |url=http://myenglish.kmutt.ac.th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many centres are using online resources from a variety of commercial English training services.

;The KELP Project
:The Kanda English Language Proficiency (KELP) program at [[Kanda University of International Studies]] in Japan is not a self-access center per se, but rather a program in which all English language classrooms become independent-learning or self-access centers.  Work that is typically done in a self-access center as an adjunct to traditional classroom activities become the core of the program. Students, with help from the teacher, create what is essentially their own course.  The teacher becomes a "facilitator" who 1) sets up the classroom with needed materials at workstations 2) trains students to make course plans and consults with them to prepare learning contracts and for teacher approval 3) Manages learner assessment by making checking records made by students of their own progress are accurate and 4) Maintains discipline in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43520">[[Serbo-Croatian]] is a [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic language]] with four [[standard language|national standards]]. The Eastern Herzegovinian [[Shtokavian dialect|Neo-Shtokavian dialect]] forms the basis for [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (the four national standards).

Serbo-Croatian has 30 [[phoneme]]s, 25 [[consonant]]s and 5 [[vowel]]s, and a [[pitch accent]], whereas [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] has two more consonants.

==Consonants==
The [[consonant]] system of Serbo-Croatian has 25 phonemes. One peculiarity is a presence of both [[post-alveolar]] and [[Palatal consonant|palatal]] [[affricates]], but a lack of corresponding [[palatal fricative]]s.&lt;ref name=Moren&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Morén|2005|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other Slavic languages such as [[Russian language|Russian]], there is no palatalized versus non-palatalized (''hard–soft'') contrast for most consonants.

It is typically realized by inserting a preceding or (more rarely) succeeding non-phonemic [[Semivowel|vocalic glide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej6ENdUGS-UC&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Principles of phonology.

However, in the standard language, vocalic {{IPA|/l/}} appears only in loanwords, as in the name for the Czech river ''Vltava'' for instance, or ''debakl'', ''bicikl''. Very rarely other sonorants are syllabic, such as {{IPA|/ʎ̩/}} in the surname ''Štarklj'' and {{IPA|/n̩/}} in ''njutn'' ('[[newton (unit)|newton]]').

A. Keating|editor1=C. Paradis|editor2=J.-F. Prunet}}&lt;/ref&gt; consonants {{IPA|/ʂ, ʐ, tʂ, dʐ/}} are, in more detailed phonetic studies, described as [[apical consonant|apical]] {{IPA|[ʃ̺, ʒ̺, t̺ʃ̺ʷ, d̺ʒ̺ʷ]}}.&lt;ref name="Moren" /&gt; In most spoken Croatian idioms, as well as in some Bosnian, they are [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] ({{IPA|/ʃ, ʒ, t͡ʃ, d͡ʒ/}}) instead, and there could be a complete or partial merger between {{IPA|/tʂ, dʐ/}} and palatal affricates {{IPA|/tɕ, dʑ/}}.&lt;ref name=Cavar&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ćavar|2011|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alveolo-palatal fricative]]s {{IPA|[ɕ, ʑ]}} are marginal phonemes, usually realized as [[consonant clusters]] {{IPA|[sj, zj]}}. However, the emerging Montenegrin standard has proposed [[Montenegrin alphabet|two additional letters]], Latin {{angbr|Ś}}, {{angbr|Ź}} and Cyrillic {{angbr|С́}}, {{angbr|З́}}, for the phonemic sequences {{IPA|/sj, zj/}}, which may be realized phonetically as {{IPA|[ɕ, ʑ]}}.

Voicing contrasts are [[Neutralization (linguistics)|neutralize]]d in [[consonant cluster]]s, so that all [[obstruent]]s are either voiced or voiceless depending on the voicing of the final consonant, though this process of voicing assimilation may be blocked by syllable boundaries.

The long Ijekavian reflex of [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] ''[[yat|jat]]'' is of disputed status. The prescriptive grammar {{harvcoltxt|Barić|Lončarić|Malić|Znika|1997}} published by the foremost Croatian normative body—the [[Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics]], describes it as a diphthong,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Barić|Lončarić|Malić|Znika|1997|p=49}} "Prednji je i složeni samoglasnik, dvoglasnik (diftong) ''ie''. Pri njegovu su izgovoru govorni organi najprije u položaju sličnom kao pri izgovoru glasa ''i'', a onda postupno prelaze u položaj za izgovor glasa ''e''. U hrvatskom književnom jeziku dvoglasnik je ''ie'' ravan diftong."&lt;/ref&gt; but this norm has been heavily criticized by phoneticians as having no foundation in the spoken language, the alleged diphthong being called a "phantom phoneme".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kapović|2007|p=66}} "Iako se odraz dugoga jata u kojem ijekavskom govoru možda i može opisati kao dvoglas, on tu u standardu sasma sigurno nije. Taj tobožnji dvoglas treba maknuti iz priručnikâ standardnoga jezika jer nema nikakve koristi od uvođenja fantomskih fonema bez ikakve podloge u standardnojezičnoj stvarnosti."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the reflex of long ''jat'', which is spelled as a [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]] {{angbr|ije}} in standard Croatian, Bosnian and Ijekavian Serbian, represents the sequence {{IPA|/jeː/}}.

Stressed vowels carry one of the two basic [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], rising and falling.

===Pitch accent===
&lt;!-- [[Serbo-Croation accent]] redirects here. Do not change section heading. --&gt;
{{see also|Shtokavian dialect#Accentuation}}
Shtokavian dialects allow two [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] on stressed syllables and have distinctive [[vowel length]] and so distinguish four combinations, called [[pitch accent]]: short falling (ȅ), short rising (è), long falling (ȇ), and long rising (é).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Diletantski napisana gramatika: recenzija knjige Vinka Grubišića, ''Croatian Grammar'' |trans-title=An amateurish grammar book: Review of the book Vinko Grubišić, ''Croatian Grammar'' |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446647.rev_art_GRUBISIC.PDF

Most speakers from Serbia and Croatia do not distinguish between short rising and short falling tones. They also pronounce most unstressed long vowels as short, with some exceptions, such as genitive plural endings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Alexander|2006|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accent is relatively free because it can be on any syllable except the last one.(Note, however, that the word paradàjz ('tomato' nominative sg.) normally bears a short rising tone on the final syllable in the speech of educated speakers. Further exceptions to this prescriptive rule are found in words such as fabrikànt ('manufacturer' nominative sg.), asistènt ('assistant' nominative sg.), apsolvènt ('student who has fulfilled all requirements except an honours thesis' nominative sg.), trafikànt ('sales assistant at a newsstand' nominative sg.), etc.) Accent alternations are very frequent in inflectional paradigms, in both quality and placement in the word (the so-called "[[mobile paradigm]]s", which were present in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] itself and became much more widespread in [[Proto-Balto-Slavic language|Proto-Balto-Slavic]]). Different inflected forms of the same lexeme can exhibit all four accents: {{wikt-lang|sh|lònac}} {{IPA|/ˈlǒnats/}} ('pot' nominative sg.), {{lang|sh|lónca}} {{IPA|/ˈlǒːntsa/}} (genitive singular), {{lang|sh|lȏnci}} {{IPA|/ˈlôːntsi/}} (nominative plural), {{lang|sh|lȍnācā}} {{IPA|/ˈlônaːtsaː/}} (genitive plural).

Research done by [[Pavle Ivić]] and [[Ilse Lehiste]] has shown that all stressed syllables of Serbo-Croatian words are basically spoken with a high tone and that native speakers rely on the phonetic tone of the first post-tonic syllable to judge the pitch accent of any given word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lehiste|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lehiste|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the high tone of the stressed syllable is carried over to the first post-tonic syllable, the accent is perceived as ''rising''. If it is not, the accent is perceived as ''falling'', which is the reason monosyllabic words are always perceived as ''falling''. Therefore, truly narrow phonetic transcriptions of {{lang|sh|lònac}}, {{lang|sh|lónca}}, {{lang|sh|lȏnci}} and {{lang|sh|lȍnācā}} are {{IPA|[ˈlónáts, ˈlóːntsá, ˈlóːntsì, ˈlónàˑtsàˑ]}} or the equivalent {{IPA|[ˈlo˦nats˦, ˈloːn˦tsa˦, ˈloːn˦tsi˨, ˈlo˦naˑ˨tsaˑ˨]}}. Ivić and Lehiste were not the first scholars to notice this; in fact, Leonhard Masing made a very similar discovery decades earlier, but it was ignored due to him being a foreigner and because it contradicted the Vukovian approach, which was then already well-ingrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Alexander|2006|p=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although distinctions of pitch occur only in stressed syllables, unstressed vowels maintain a length distinction. Pretonic syllables are always short, but posttonic syllables may be either short or long. These are traditionally counted as two additional accents. In the standard language, the six accents are realized as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! Slavicist&lt;br&gt;symbol !! [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]&lt;br&gt;symbol !! Description
|-
| '''{{lang|sh|ȅ}}''' || {{IPA|ê}} || style="text-align: left;" | short vowel with falling tone
|-
| '''{{lang|sh|ȇ}}''' || {{IPA|êː}} || style="text-align: left;" | long vowel with falling tone
|-
| '''{{lang|sh|è}}''' || {{IPA|ě}} || style="text-align: left;" | short vowel with rising tone

|-
| '''{{lang|sh|ē}}''' || {{IPA|eː}} || style="text-align: left;" | non-tonic long vowel
|}

Examples are short falling as in {{lang|sh|nȅbo}} ('sky') {{IPA|/ˈnêbo/}}; long falling as in {{lang|sh|pîvo}} ('beer') {{IPA|/ˈpîːvo/}}; short rising as in {{lang|sh|màskara}} ('eye makeup') {{IPA|/ˈmǎskara/}}; long rising as in {{lang|sh|čokoláda}} ('chocolate') {{IPA|/t͡ʂokoˈlǎːda/}}. Unstressed long syllables can occur only after the accented syllable, as in {{lang|sh|d(j)èvōjka}} ('girl') {{IPA|/ˈd(ј)ěvoːjka/}} or {{lang|sh|dòstavljānje}} ('delivering') {{IPA|/ˈdǒstavʎaːɲe/}}. There can be more than one post-accent length in a word, notably in genitive plural of nouns: {{lang|sh|kȍcka}} ('cubes') → {{lang|sh|kȍcākā}} ('cubes&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'). Realization of the accents varies by region.

Restrictions on the distribution of the accent depend, beside the position of the syllable, also on its quality, as not every kind of accent can be manifested in every syllable.
# Falling tone generally occurs in monosyllabic words or the first syllable of a word&lt;ref name=KordiSCpg8&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kordić|2006|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{wikt-lang|sh|pȃs}} ('belt'), {{wikt-lang|sh|rȏg}} ('horn'); {{wikt-lang|sh|bȁba}} ('old woman'), {{wikt-lang|sh|lȃđa}} ('river ship'); {{wikt-lang|sh|kȕćica}} ('small house'), [[Karlovac|''Kȃrlovac'']]). The only exception to this rule are interjections, words uttered in the state of excitement (such as {{lang|sh|ahȁ}}, {{lang|sh|ohȏ}})
# Rising tone generally occurs in any syllable of a word except the last one and so never occurs in monosyllabics&lt;ref name=KordiSCpg8/&gt; ({{wikt-lang|sh|vòda}} 'water', {{wikt-lang|sh|lúka}} 'harbour'; {{wikt-lang|sh|lìvada}} 'meadow', {{wikt-lang|sh|lúpānje}} 'slamming'; {{wikt-lang|sh|siròta}} 'female orphan', {{wikt-lang|sh|počétak}} 'beginning'; {{wikt-lang|sh|crvotòčina}} 'wormhole', {{wikt-lang|sh|oslobođénje}} 'liberation').

Thus, monosyllabics generally have falling tone, and polysyllabics generally have falling or rising tone on the first syllable and rising in all the other syllables but the last one. The tonal opposition rising ~ falling is hence generally possible only in the first accented syllable of polysyllabic words, and the opposition by lengths, long ~ short, is possible even in the non-accented syllable as well as in the postaccented syllable (but not in the preaccented position).

[[Proclitic]]s, clitics that latch on to a following word, on the other hand, may "steal" a falling tone (but not a rising tone) from the following monosyllabic or disyllabic word. The stolen accent is always short and may end up being either falling or rising on the proclitic. The phenomenon (accent shift to proclitic) is most frequent in the spoken idioms of Bosnia, as in Serbian it is more limited (normally with the negation proclitic ''ne'') and it is almost absent from Croatian Neo-Shtokavian idioms.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; Such a shift is less frequent for short rising accents than for the falling one (as seen in this example: {{IPA|/ʒěliːm/}} → {{IPA|/ne ʒěliːm/}}).

==Morphophonemic alternations==
Serbo-Croatian exhibits a number of morphophonological alternations. Some of them are inherited from Proto-Slavic and are shared with other Slavic languages, and some of them are exclusive to Serbo-Croatian, representing later innovation.

===Fleeting a===
The so-called "fleeting a" (Serbo-Croatian: {{lang|sh|nepóstojānō a}}), or "movable a", refers to the phenomenon of short /a/ making apparently random appearance and loss in certain inflected forms of nouns. This is a result of different types of reflexes Common Slavic ''[[yers|jers]]'' */ъ/ and */ь/, which in Štokavian and [[Chakavian dialect|Čakavian]] dialects merged to one schwa-like sound, which was lost in a [[Havlík's law|weak position]] and vocalized to */a/ in a [[Havlík's law|strong position]], giving rise to what is apparently unpredictable alternation. In most of the cases, this has led to such /a/ appearing in word forms ending in consonant clusters,&lt;ref name=KordiSCpg7&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kordić|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not in forms with vowel ending.

The "fleeting a" is most common in the following cases:&lt;ref name=KordiSCpg7/&gt;
* in nominative singular, accusative singular for inanimate nouns, and genitive plural for certain type of masculine nouns:
*: {{wikt-lang|sh|bórac}} ('fighter' nom. sg.) – {{lang|sh|bórca}} (gen. sg.) – {{lang|sh|bȏrācā}} (gen. pl.)
*: {{wikt-lang|sh|mòmak}} ('young man' nom. sg.) – {{lang|sh|mòmka}} (gen. sg.) – {{lang|sh|momákā}} (gen. pl.)
*: {{wikt-lang|sh|stòlac}} ('chair' nom. sg.) – {{lang|sh|stólca}} (gen. sg.) – {{lang|sh|stȍlācā}} (gen. pl.)
* in genitive plural forms of feminine nouns ending in a consonant cluster:
*: {{wikt-lang|sh|dàska}} ('board') – {{lang|sh|dasákā}}, {{wikt-lang|sh|sèstra}} ('sister') – {{lang|sh|sestárā}}, {{wikt-lang|sh|bȁčva}} ('barrel') – {{lang|sh|bȁčāvā}}
* in nominative singular indefinite masculine forms of adjectives and pronouns:
*: ''[[wikt:kratak#Serbo-Croatian|kràtak]] ('short') – {{lang|sh|kràtkī}}, ''[[wikt:kakav#Serbo-Croatian|kàkāv]] ('what kind of') – {{lang|sh|kàkvi}}, {{wikt-lang|sh|sȁv}} ('entire') – {{lang|sh|svȉ}}

===Palatalization===
{{Further|Slavic first palatalization}}

The reflex of the Slavic first palatalization was retained in Serbo-Croatian as an alternation of
: {{IPA|/k/}} → {{IPA|/t͡ʂ/}}
: {{IPA|/ɡ/}} → {{IPA|/ʐ/}}
: {{IPA|/x/}} → {{IPA|/ʂ/}}
before {{IPA|/e/}} in inflection, and before {{IPA|/j, i, e/}} and some other segments in word formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Browne|1993|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; This alternation is prominently featured in several characteristic cases:

* in [[vocative case|vocative]] singular of masculine nouns, where it is triggered by the ending -e:
*: {{wikt-lang|sh|jùnāk}} ('hero') → ''jȕnāče'',&amp;nbsp; {{wikt-lang|sh|vrȃg}} ('devil') → ''vrȃže'',&amp;nbsp; {{wikt-lang|sh|òrah}} ('walnut') → {{lang|sh|òraše}}. It is, however, not caused by the same ending {{lang|sh|-e}} in accusative plural: {{lang|sh|junáke}}, {{lang|sh|vrȃge}},&lt;ref&gt;This is a stylistically marked form: the usual plural form of {{lang|sh|vrȃg}} is with -''ov''- interfix: {{lang|sh|vrȁgovi}}; accusative plural: {{lang|sh|vrȁgove}}, but the infix is inhibiting the environment conditioning the palatalization, so the short plural form was provided.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|sh|òrahe}}.
* in the present stem of certain verbs before the endings in {{lang|sh|-e}}:
*:* {{wikt-lang|sh|pȅći}} ('to bake') – present stem {{lang|sh|pèk-}}; ''pèčēm'' ('I bake'), but ''pèkū'' ('they bake') without palatalization before the 3rd person plural ending ''-u''
*:* {{wikt-lang|sh|strȉći}} ('to shear') – present stem {{lang|sh|stríg-}}; ''strížem'' ('I shear'), but ''strígū'' ('they shear') without palatalization before the 3rd person plural ending ''-u''
*:* {{wikt-lang|sh|mȍći}} ('can – present stem') {{lang|sh|mog-}}; ''mȍžeš'' ('you can'), but ''mògu'' ('I can'), without the palatalization before the archaic 1st person singular ending ''-u''
* in aorist formation of some verbs:
*:* {{wikt-lang|sh|rȅći}} ('to say') – ''rèkoh'' ('I said' aorist), as opposed to {{lang|sh|rȅče}} (2nd/3rd person singular aorist)
*:* {{wikt-lang|sh|stȉći}} ('to arrive') – ''stȉgoh'' ('I arrived' 1st person singular aorist), as opposed to {{lang|sh|stȉže}} (2nd/3rd person singular aorist)
* in derivation of certain classes of nouns and verbs:
*:* {{wikt-lang|sh|mȕka}} ('torment') → {{wikt-lang|sh|mȕčiti}} ('to torment'); {{wikt-lang|sh|zrȃk}} ('air') → {{wikt-lang|sh|zráčiti}} ('to air'),&amp;nbsp; {{wikt-lang|sh|trȃg}} ('trace') → {{wikt-lang|sh|trážiti}} ('to seek')
*:* ''slúga'' ('servant') → ''slúžiti'' ('to serve'),&amp;nbsp; ''njȗh'' ('the sense of smell') → ''njȕšiti'' ('to smell')
* before the "fleeting a", and before the endings {{lang|sh|-an, -ji}} and several others:
*:* ''dȃh'' ('breath') → ''dášak'' ('puff'), ''Kartága'' ('Carthage') → ''Kartážanin'' ('Carthaginian'), ''bȏg'' ('god') → ''bȍžjī'' ('god's'), ''strȃh'' ('fear') → ''strášan'' ('fearsome')
* a few words exhibit palatalization in which {{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} palatalize before vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}, yielding {{IPA|/ʂ/}} and {{IPA|/ʐ/}}. Such palatals have often been leveled out in various derived forms. For example:
*:* ''strȋc'' ('uncle') – ''strȋče'' ('uncle! ') – ''stríčev'' ('uncle's'), ''lòvac'' ('hunter') – ''lȏvče'' ('hunter!') – ''lóvčev'' ('hunter's'), ''zȇc'' ('hare') – ''zȇče'' ('hare!') – ''zȅčevi'' ('hares'), ''ȕlica'' ('street') – ''ȕličica'' ('alley'), ''ptȉca'' ('bird') – ''ptȉčica'' ('small bird') – ''ptičùrina'' ('big ugly bird')
*:* ''vȉtēz'' ('knight') – ''vȉtēže'' ('knight! '), ''knȇz'' ('prince') – ''knȇže'' ('prince!')

There are some exceptions to the process of palatalization. The conditions are:
* before the diminutive suffix ''{{lang|sh|-ica}}''
*:* ''mȁčka'' • ''ма̏чка'' ('cat') → ''mȁčkica'' ('kitten'), ''p(j)ȅga'' ('freckle') → ''p(j)ȅgica'' ('small freckle'), ''bùha'' ('flea') → ''bùhica'' ('small flea')
* before the possessive suffix {{lang|sh|-in}} in adjectives derived from hypocoristic nouns:
*:* ''báka'' ('grandma') → ''bákīn'' ('grandma's'), ''zéko'' ('bunny') → ''zékīn'' ('bunny's'), ''máca'' ('kitten') → ''mácin'' ('kitten's')
Doublets exist with adjectives derived with suffix {{lang|sh|-in}} from trisyllabic proper names:
* {{lang|sh|Dànica}} → {{lang|sh|Dàničin}} : {{lang|sh|Dànicin}}, {{lang|sh|Ȉvica}} → {{lang|sh|Ȉvičin}} : {{lang|sh|Ȉvicin}}, {{lang|sh|Ànkica}} → {{lang|sh|Ànkičin}} : {{lang|sh|Ànkicin}}

===Sibilantization===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
{{Further|Slavic second palatalization|Slavic third palatalization}}
The output of the [[Slavic second palatalization|second]] and the [[Slavic third palatalization|third]] Slavic palatalization is in the Serbo-Croatian grammar tradition known as "sibilantization" (sibilarizácija/сибилариза́ција). It results in the following alternations before {{IPA|/i/}}:
: {{IPA|/k/}} → {{IPA|/ts/}}
: {{IPA|/ɡ/}} → {{IPA|/z/}}
: {{IPA|/x/}} → {{IPA|/s/}}
This alternation is prominently featured in several characteristic cases:
* in the imperative forms of verbs with stem ending in {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and one verb in {{IPA|/x/}}:
*:* ''pȅći'' ('to bake' present stem) {{lang|sh|pèk-}}; ''pèci'' ('bake!' 2nd person singular imperative)
*:* ''strȉći'' ('to shear' present stem) {{lang|sh|stríg-}}; ''strízi'' ('shear!' 2nd person singular imperative)
*:* ''vȓći'' ('to thresh' present stem) {{lang|sh|vŕh-}}; ''vŕsi'' ('thresh!' 2nd person singular imperative)
* in masculine nominative plurals with the ending ''{{lang|sh|-i}}'':
*: ''jùnāk'' ('hero') → {{lang|sh|junáci}}
*:''kr̀čag'' ('jug') → {{lang|sh|kr̀čazi}}
*:''prȍpūh'' ('draught [of air]') → {{lang|sh|prȍpūsi}}
* in dative and locative singular of a-stem nouns (prevalently feminine):
*: ''mȃjka'' ('mother') → {{lang|sh|mȃjci}}
*:''nòga'' ('leg') → {{lang|sh|nòzi}}
*:''snàha'' ('daughter-in-law') → {{lang|sh|snàsi}}
* in dative, locative and instrumental of masculine o-stems:
*: ''jùnāk'' ('hero') → {{lang|sh|junácima}}
*:''kr̀čag'' ('jug') → {{lang|sh|kr̀čazima}}
* in the formation of imperfective verbs to perfective verbs
*: ''dȉgnuti'' ('to lift') – ''dȉzati'' ('to keep something ifting')
*:''uzdàhnuti'' ('to sigh') – ''ùzdisati'' ('to keep sighing') but first-person singular present: ''ùzdišēm'' ('I sigh')

In two cases there is an exception to sibilantization:
* in nominative singular of masculine nouns:
** in monosyllabic borrowings:
**: {{lang|sh|Bȁsk}} ('Basque') →{{lang|sh|Bȁski}}, {{lang|sh|brȍnh}} ('bronchus') →{{lang|sh|brȍnhi}}, {{lang|sh|ȅrg}} → {{lang|sh|ȅrgi}}
** in toponyms in plural form, usually from a region where [[Kajkavian dialect]] is spoken:
**: {{lang|sh|Čȅhi}} ('Czechs'), {{lang|sh|Nȍvāki}} ('Novaks')
** some surnames that are not identical to some general noun of the standard language
**: {{lang|sh|Srȅćko}} → {{lang|sh|Srȅćki}}, {{lang|sh|Zelénko}} → {{lang|sh|Zelénki}}
** with nouns having 'fleeting a' in the ending {{lang|sh|-cak}}
**: {{lang|sh|natucak}} → {{lang|sh|natucki}}
* in dative and locative case of feminine and masculine a-stems
** in [[hypocorism]]s
**: {{lang|sh|báka}} ('grandmother') →{{lang|sh|báki}}, {{lang|sh|séka}} ('little sister') →{{lang|sh|séki}}, {{lang|sh|bráco}} ('little brother') →{{lang|sh|bráci}}, {{lang|sh|zéko}} ('bunny') →{{lang|sh|zéki}}, {{lang|sh|stríko}} ('uncle [affectionate]') →{{lang|sh|stríki}}
** in words whose stem ends in a single consonant:
**: {{lang|sh|dȅka}} ('blanket') →{{lang|sh|dȅki}}, {{lang|sh|kȕka}} ('hook') →{{lang|sh|kȕki}}, {{lang|sh|koléga}} ('colleague') →{{lang|sh|kolégi}}, {{lang|sh|pjȅga}} ('freckle') →{{lang|sh|pjȅgi}}, {{lang|sh|zȃliha}} ('supply') →{{lang|sh|zȃlihi}}
** in names and surnames
**: {{lang|sh|Jȇlka}} → {{lang|sh|Jȇlki}}, {{lang|sh|Lȗka}} → {{lang|sh|Lȗki}}, {{lang|sh|Jȁdrānka}} → {{lang|sh|Jȁdrānki}}
** in nouns ending in {{lang|sh|-cka}}, {{lang|sh|-čka}}, {{lang|sh|-ćka}}, {{lang|sh|-ska}}, {{lang|sh|-tka}}, {{lang|sh|-zga}}:
**: {{lang|sh|kȍcka}} ('cube') →{{lang|sh|kȍcki}}, {{lang|sh|tȍčka}} ('point') →{{lang|sh|tȍčki}}, {{lang|sh|prȁćka}} ('sling') →{{lang|sh|prȁćki}}, {{lang|sh|pljȕska}} ('slap') →{{lang|sh|pljȕski}}, {{lang|sh|pȁtka}} ('duck' feminine) →{{lang|sh|pȁtki}}, {{lang|sh|màzga}} ('mule') →{{lang|sh|màzgi}}
** in some [[toponym]]s
**: {{lang|sh|Kȑka}} → {{lang|sh|Kȑki}}, {{lang|sh|Kartága}}  ('Carthage') → {{lang|sh|Kartági}}
** in nouns ending in suffix -''ka'' with stem-final [[sonorant]]:
**: {{lang|sh|intelektùālka}} ('an intellectual' feminine) →{{lang|sh|intelektùālki}}, {{lang|sh|kàjkāvka}} ('Kajkavian speaker' feminine) →{{lang|sh|kàjkāvki}}, {{lang|sh|srednjòškōlka}} ('high school girl') →{{lang|sh|srednjòškōlki}}

Doublets are allowed in the following cases:
* nominative plural of some masculine borrowings:
*: {{lang|sh|flamìngo}} → {{lang|sh|flamìnzi}} : {{lang|sh|flamìngi}}
* in nominative plural of surnames who are identical with some general masculine noun:
*: {{lang|sh|Bȅg}} → {{lang|sh|Bȅgi}} : {{lang|sh|Bȅzi}}, {{lang|sh|Dȕh}} → {{lang|sh|Dȕhi}} : {{lang|sh|Dȕsi}}
* in nominative plural of masculine nouns with "fleeting a" and the ending {{lang|sh|-čak}}, {{lang|sh|-ćak}} or {{lang|sh|-đak}}
*: {{lang|sh|máčak}} ('cat' masculine) →{{lang|sh|máčki}} : {{lang|sh|máčci}}, {{lang|sh|òplećak}} ('[[ephod]]') →{{lang|sh|òplećki}} : {{lang|sh|òplećci}}, {{lang|sh|omeđak}} → {{lang|sh|omećki}} : {{lang|sh|omećci}}
* in dative and locative of some feminine foponyms with stem ending in a single consonant:
*: ''{{lang|sh|Líka → Líci : Líki}}''
* in dative and locative of some toponyms ending in {{lang|sh|-ska}}, {{lang|sh|-ška}}:
*: {{lang|sh|Àljaska}} ('Alaska') →''{{lang|sh|Àljaski : Àljasci}}'', ''{{lang|sh|Gràdiška → Gràdiški : Gràdišci}}''
* in dative and locative of some feminines ending in {{lang|sh|-ska}}, {{lang|sh|-tka}}, {{lang|sh|-vka}}:
*: {{lang|sh|gȕska}} ('goose') →''{{lang|sh|gȕski : gȕsci}}'', ''{{lang|sh|bȉtka}}'' ('battle') →''{{lang|sh|bȉtki : bȉ(t)ci}}'', {{lang|sh|trȃvka}} ('blade of grass') → ''{{lang|sh|trȃvci : trȃvki}}''

There are two types of [[consonant assimilation]]: by voicing (''jednačenje po zvučnosti'') and by place of articulation (''jednačenje po m(j)estu tvorbe'').

All consonants in clusters are neutralized by voicing, but Serbo-Croatian does not exhibit [[final-obstruent devoicing]] as most other Slavic languages do.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://web.mit.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/kenstowicz/laryngeal_licensing.doc |title= Two notes on laryngeal licensing |author=Kenstowicz, Abu-Mansour, and Törkenczy |page=7 |publisher=MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assimilation is practically always regressive, i.e. voicing of the group is determined by voicing of the last consonant.&lt;ref name="zvucnost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravopis.hr/pravilo/jednacenje-po-zvucnosti/6/ |title=Jednačenje suglasnika po zvučnosti |work=Pravopis hrvatskog jezika |language=Serbo-Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonorants are exempted from assimilation, so it affects only the following consonants:

* {{IPA|/b/ ↔ /p/}}
*: {{lang|sh|kobac}} ('Hawk') →{{lang|sh|kobca}} : {{lang|sh|kopca}} (nominative → genitive, with fleeting ''a'')
*: {{lang|sh|top}} ('cannon') + {{lang|sh|džija}} → {{lang|sh|topdžija}} : {{lang|sh|tobdžija}} ('cannonman')
* {{IPA|/ɡ/ ↔ /k/}}
*:
*: {{lang|sh|burek}} ('[[burek]]') + {{lang|sh|džija}} → {{lang|sh|burekdžija}} : {{lang|sh|buregdžija}} ('Burek-baker')
* {{IPA|/d/ ↔ /t/}}
*: {{lang|sh|pod-}} ('under-') + {{lang|sh|platiti}} ('pay') → {{lang|sh|podplatiti}} : {{lang|sh|potplatiti}} ('to bribe')
*:
* {{IPA|/d͡ʐ/ ↔ /t͡ʂ/}}
*:
*: {{lang|sh|vrač}} ('sorcerer') + {{lang|sh|-bina}} → {{lang|sh|vračbina}} : {{lang|sh|vradžbina}} ('witchcraft')
* {{IPA|/ʒ/ ↔ /ʃ/}}
*: {{lang|sh|težak}} ('heavy') →{{lang|sh|težki}} : {{lang|sh|teški}} (singular → plural, with fleeting ''a'')
*:
* {{IPA|/z/ ↔ /s/}}
*: {{lang|sh|uzak}} ('narrow') →{{lang|sh|uzki}} : {{lang|sh|uski}} (singular → plural, with fleeting ''a'')
*: {{lang|sh|s-}} ('off-') + {{lang|sh|baciti}} ('throw') →{{lang|sh|sbaciti}} : {{lang|sh|zbaciti}} ('throw off')
* {{IPA|/d͡ʐ/ ↔ /t͡ʂ/}}
*:
*: {{lang|sh|uč}} ('learn-') + {{lang|sh|-benik}} → {{lang|sh|učbenik}} : {{lang|sh|udžbenik}} ('textbook')

Furthermore, {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/x/}} and {{IPA|/ts/}} don't have voiced counterparts, so they trigger the assimilation, but are not affected by it.&lt;ref name="zvucnost"/&gt;

As can be seen from the examples above, assimilation is generally reflected in orthography. However, there are numerous orthographic exceptions, i.e. even if voicing or devoicing does take place in speech, the orthography does not record it, usually to maintain the etymology clearer.

====Assimilation by place of articulation====

Assimilation by place of articulation affects {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} in front of (post)alveolars {{IPA|/ʃ/, /ʒ/, /t͡ʂ/, /d͡ʐ/, /tɕ/, /dʑ/}}, as well as palatals {{IPA|/ʎ/}} and {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, producing {{IPA|/ʃ/}} or {{IPA|/ʒ/}}:&lt;ref name="zvucnost"/&gt;

* {{IPA|/s/ → /ʃ/}}
*: {{lang|sh|pas}} ('dog') + ''{{lang|sh|-če → pašče}}'' ('small dog')
*: {{lang|sh|list}} ('leaf') + ''{{lang|sh|-je → listće : lisće : lišće}}'' ('leaves')
*: {{lang|sh|prositi}} ('to beg') + ''{{lang|sh|-nja → prosnja : prošnja}}'' ('begging')
*: {{lang|sh|snositi}} ('to bear') + ''{{lang|sh|-ljiv → snosljiv : snošljiv}}'' ('bearable')
* {{IPA|/z/ → /ʒ/}}
*: {{lang|sh|miraz}} ('dowry') + ''{{lang|sh|-džika → mirazdžika : miraždžika}}'' ('girl with dowry')
*: {{lang|sh|grozd}} ('grape bunch') + ''{{lang|sh|-je → grozđe : grožđe}}'' ('grapes')
*: {{lang|sh|paziti}} ('to care') + ''{{lang|sh|-nja → paznja : pažnja}}'' ('care')
*: {{lang|sh|paziti}} ('to care') + ''{{lang|sh|-ljiv → pazljiv : pažljiv}}'' ('careful')

Simultaneously, assimilation by voicing is triggered if necessary.

===L-vocalization===
{{see also|L-vocalization}}
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}
A historical {{IPA|/l/}} in coda position has become {{IPA|/o/}} and is now so spelled, and produces an additional syllable. For example, the Serbo-Croatian name of [[Belgrade]] is ''Beograd''. However, in Croatian, the process is partially reversed; compare Croatian ''stol'', ''vol'', ''sol'' vs. Serbian ''sto'', ''vo'', ''so'' ('table', 'ox' and 'salt').

==Sample==
The sample text is a reading of the first sentence of [[The North Wind and the Sun]] by a 57-year-old female announcer at the Croatian Television Network reading in a colloquial style.&lt;ref name="Landau66"/&gt;

===Phonemic transcription===
{{IPA|/sjêʋeːrniː lědeniː ʋjêtar i‿sûːnt͡se‿su‿se prěpirali o‿sʋǒjoj snǎːzi/}}&lt;ref name="Landau69"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Landau|Lončarić|Horga|Škarić|1999|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonetic transcription===
{{IPA|[sjêʋeˑrniˑ ɫědeniˑ ʋjêtar i‿sûːnt͡se‿su‿se prěpiraɫi o‿sʋǒjoj snǎːzi]}}

===Orthographic version (Croatian)===
Sjeverni ledeni vjetar i Sunce su se prepirali o svojoj snazi.&lt;ref name="Landau69"/&gt;

A '''sit-down strike''' is a [[labour strike]] and a form of [[civil disobedience]] in which an organized group of workers, usually employed at factories or other centralized locations, take unauthorized or illegal [[Occupation of factories|possession of the workplace]] by "sitting down" at their stations. The attraction for workers of a sit-down strike is that the practice prevents employers from replacing them with [[strikebreaker]]s or removing equipment to transfer production to other locations. [[Neal Ascherson]] has commented that an additional attraction of the practice is that it emphasizes the role of workers in providing for the people, and allows workers to in effect hold valuable machinery hostage as a bargaining chip.{{sfn|Ascherson|1983}}{{verification needed|date=July 2018}}

Workers have used this technique since the beginning of the 20th century in countries such as [[United States]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Croatia]], and [[France]]. However, sit-down strikes are now uncommon.

==Notable examples==
{{Globalize/West|section|date=July 2018}}
The radical syndicalist group [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) were the first American union to use the sit-down strike. On December 10, 1906, at the General Electric Works in [[Schenectady, New York]], 3,000 workers sat down on the job and stopped production to protest the dismissal of three fellow IWW members.{{sfnm |1a1=Dubofsky |1y=2000 |1p=71 |2a1=Watson |2y=2005 |2p=54}} The three fired IWW members were ultimately rehired.{{sfn|McGerr|2010|p=141}}

The [[United Auto Workers]] staged successful{{clarify|date=December 2016}}&lt;!--successful how? --&gt; sit-down strikes in the 1930s, most famously in the [[Flint Sit-Down Strike]] of 1936–1937. In [[Flint, Michigan]], strikers occupied several [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] plants for more than forty days, and repelled the efforts of the police and National Guard to retake them. A wave of sit-down strikes followed, but diminished by the end of the decade as the courts and the [[National Labor Relations Board]] held that sit-down strikes were illegal and sit-down strikers could be fired (see the 1939 Supreme Court ruling in [[NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp.]]). While some sit-down strikes still occur in the United States, they tend to be spontaneous and short-lived.

French workers engaged in a number of [[occupation of factories|factory occupations]] in the wake of the [[French May|French student revolt]] in May 1968. At one point more than twenty-five percent of French workers were on strike, many of them occupying their factories.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

In 1973, the workers at the [[Triumph Motorcycles Ltd|Triumph Motorcycles]] factory at [[Meriden, West Midlands]], locked the new owners, [[Norton Villiers Triumph|NVT]], out following the announcement of their plan to close Meriden.{{sfn|Brooke|2002|p=148}} The sit-in lasted over a year until the British government intervened, the result of which was the formation of the Meriden Motorcycle Co-operative{{sfn|Brooke|2002|p=148}} which produced Triumphs until their closure in 1983.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

The sit-down strike was the inspiration for the [[sit-in]], where an organized group of protesters would occupy an area in which they are not wanted by sitting and refuse to leave until their demands are met.

'''''The Children of Men''''' is a [[dystopia]]n novel by English writer [[P. D. James]], published in 1992. Set in [[England]] in 2021, it centres on the results of [[Human extinction|mass infertility]]. James describes a [[United Kingdom]] that is steadily depopulating and focuses on a small group of resisters who do not share the disillusionment of the masses.

The book received very positive reviews from many critics such as Caryn James of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who called it "wonderfully rich" and "a trenchant analysis of politics and power that speaks urgently".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/movies/28men.html|title=Children of Differing Visions: Contrasting a P. D. James Novel and the Movie It Inspired|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|first=Caryn|last=James|date=28 December 2006|accessdate=19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic [[Alan Jacobs (academic)|Alan Jacobs]] said, "Of all James’ novels, ''The Children of Men'' is probably the most pointed in its social criticism, certainly the deepest in its [[Theology|theological]] reflection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Alan|title=Life's Value|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/1993/08/002-lifes-value|website=firstthings.com|publisher=First Things|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

The [[Narration|narrative voice]] for the novel alternates between the [[third-person narrative|third person]] and the [[First-person narrative|first person]], the latter in the form of a diary kept by Dr. Theodore "Theo" Faron, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] [[University don|don]].

The novel opens with the first entry in Theo's diary. It is the year 2021; but the novel's events have their origin in 1995, which is referred to as "Year [[Omega]]". In 1994, the [[sperm count]] of human males plummeted to zero, and a feminist civil war breaks out, and mankind now faces imminent extinction. The last people to be born are now called "Omegas". "A race apart", they enjoy various [[prerogative]]s. Theo writes that the last human being to be born on Earth has been killed in a pub brawl.

In 2006, Xan Lyppiatt, Theo's rich and charismatic cousin, appointed himself [[Wikt:warden|Warden]] of England in the last [[elections in the United Kingdom|general election]]. As people have lost all interest in politics, Lyppiatt abolishes democracy. He is called a [[despotism|despot]] and [[tyrant]] by his opponents, but officially the new society is referred to as [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]].

Theo is approached by a woman called Julian, a member of a group of [[dissident]]s calling themselves the Five Fishes. He meets with them at an isolated church. Rolf, their leader and Julian's husband, is hostile; but the others–Miriam (a former [[midwife]]), Gascoigne (a man from a military family), Luke (a former [[priest]]), and Julian–are more personable. The group wants Theo to approach Xan on their behalf and ask for various reforms, including a return to a more democratic system. During their discussions, as Theo prepares to meet with Xan, the reader learns how the UK is in 2021:

* The Omegas are described as spoiled, over-entitled and egotistical because of their youth and luxurious lifestyle. They are violent, remote, and unstable. They regard non-Omegas (elders) with undisguised contempt, yet they're spared punishment due to their age. According to rumour, outside of [[Great Britain|Britain]], some countries sacrifice Omegas in fertility rituals.
*Due to the global infertility of mankind, newborn animals (such as kittens and puppies) are doted upon and treated as infants, pushed in prams, and dressed in children's clothing. The latest trend in [[London]] is to have elaborate christening ceremonies for newborn pets.
* The country is governed by [[rule by decree|decree]] of the Council of England, which consists of five people. [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] has been reduced to an advisory role. The aims of the Council are: (1) protection and security, (2) comfort, and (3) pleasure—corresponding to the Warden's promises of: (1) freedom from fear, (2) freedom from want, and (3) freedom from boredom.
* The [[Grenadier Guards|Grenadiers]] — formerly an elite regiment in the [[British Armed Forces]] – are the Warden's private army. The State Secret Police (SSP) ensures the Council's decrees are executed.
* The courts still exist, but juries have been abolished. Under the "new arrangements", defendants are tried by a judge and two magistrates. All convicted criminals are dumped at a penal colony on the [[Isle of Man]]. There is no [[wikt:remission|remission]], escape is almost impossible, visitors are forbidden, and prisoners may not write or receive letters.
* Every citizen is required to learn skills, such as [[Animal Husbandry]], which they might need to help them survive if they happen to be among the last human beings in Britain.
* [[Foreign workers]] are lured into the country and then exploited. Young people, preferably Omegas, from poorer countries come to England to work there. These "foreign Omegas" or, generally, "sojourners", are imported to do undesirable work. At 60, which is the age limit, they are sent back ("forcibly repatriated"). British Omegas are not allowed to [[emigrate]] so as to prevent further loss of labour.
* Elderly/infirm citizens have become a burden; [[nursing homes]] are for the privileged few. The rest are expected and sometimes [[Forced suicide|forced to commit suicide]] by taking part in a "quietus" (Council-sanctioned mass drowning) at the age of 60.
* The state has opened "[[pornography]] centres" as well as installing special transmitters that emit a special kind of radiation designed to increase libido.  Twice a year, healthy women under 45 must submit to a [[Gynecology|gynaecological]] examination; and most men must have their [[sperm]] tested, to keep hope alive.

Theo's meeting, which turns out to be a meeting with the full Council of England, does not go well. Some of the members resent him because he resigned as Xan's advisor rather than share the responsibility of governing the UK. Xan guesses that Theo's suggestions came from others and makes clear to Theo that he will take action against dissidents.

The Five Fishes distribute a leaflet detailing their demands. The secret police visit Theo. He sees Julian in the market shortly afterwards. He tells her of the SSP visit, then tells her that if ever she needs him she only has to send for him. That night, however, Theo decides to leave England for the summer and visit the continent before nature overruns it.

Soon after Theo's return, Miriam tells him that Gascoigne was arrested as he was trying to rig a Quietus landing stage to explode. The other Fishes are about to go on the run, and Julian wants him. Miriam reveals why Julian did not come herself—she is pregnant. Theo believes Julian is deceiving herself, but when the two meet, Julian invites Theo to listen to her baby's heartbeat.

During the group's flight, Luke is killed while trying to protect Julian during a confrontation with a wild gang of Omegas. Julian confesses that the father of her child is not Rolf, but rather the deceased Luke. Rolf, who believes he should rule the U.K. in Xan's place, is angered at the discovery; he abandons the group to notify the Warden.

The group heads to a shack Theo knows of. Miriam delivers Julian's baby – a boy, not a girl as Julian had thought. Miriam goes to find more supplies; after she is gone too long, Theo investigates. He finds Miriam dead, [[garrot]]ted in a nearby house. Theo returns to Julian, but soon afterward Julian hears a noise outside – Xan.

Theo and Xan confront each other and both fire one shot. The sudden wailing of the baby startles Xan, causing him to miss, as Rolf had thought the baby would not be born for another month. Theo shoots and kills Xan. He removes from Xan's finger the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom#Other items|Coronation Ring]], which Xan had taken to wearing as a symbol of authority,  and seems poised to become the new leader of the UK – at least temporarily. The other members of the Council are introduced to the baby, and Theo baptises him.

"'''The Fight'''" is the sixth episode of the [[The Office (U.S. season 2)|second season]] of the television series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', and the show's twelfth episode overall. It was written by [[Gene Stupnitsky]] and [[Lee Eisenberg]] and directed by [[Ken Kwapis]]. It originally aired on November 1, 2005 on [[NBC]]. "The Fight" guest starred [[Lance Krall]], who played the part of Dwight's sensei, Ira.

The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]), after being embarrassed by [[Dwight Schrute]]'s ([[Rainn Wilson]]) superior fighting skills, engages in a [[karate]] match with Dwight during lunch. Meanwhile, [[Jim Halpert]]'s ([[John Krasinski]]) flirting with [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) goes too far.

"The Fight" was known as "Karate" and "The Dojo" by members of the cast and crew due to many of the scenes featuring the titular fight. Several of the cast members of the show, recurring and starring, had martial arts experience. The episode contained several cultural references, with many referring to popular fighting-related movies and television shows. "The Fight" received largely positive reviews from critics. The episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 3.9 in the 18–49 demographic and was viewed by 7.9 million viewers.

==Synopsis==
&lt;!-- Per Wikipedia "television episode" guidelines [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:EPISODE#Plot_summaries], the summary should not exceed ten words per minute of screen time. This is a 20-minute episode, so the limit is 200 words. --&gt;
[[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) has one task: sign routine documents. Unfortunately, it's a month where three separate sets of paperwork are due at the same time, so Michael mulishly ignores his workload. To procrastinate, Michael makes [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) update emergency contact information of the staff. When Michael gets Ryan's cell phone number, he constantly [[prank call]]s Ryan with crude impersonations of [[Michael Jackson]], [[Mike Tyson]], and [[Saddam Hussein]].

Talk of [[Dwight Schrute]]'s ([[Rainn Wilson]]) [[karate]] experience gets Michael's competitive juices flowing, leading to a lunchtime match between the two at Dwight's dojo. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) accidentally goes too far when horsing around with [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]), and she abruptly shuts him down when their co-workers take notice.

After a pathetic showing by both combatants, Michael emerges victorious over Dwight, which leads to Dwight changing his emergency contact from "Michael Scott" to "The Hospital". At the end of the day, Michael promotes Dwight from his lowly "Assistant to the Regional Manager" position to his dream position: "Assistant Regional Manager" (although the "promotion" is little more than a title change only). However, this was done most likely to ensure that Dwight will still idolize him despite the hard feelings over their lunchtime battle. The rest of the staff, fed up with Michael's inability to accomplish even the simplest task, are forced to forge his signature on all the documents and get home.

On the way out, Jim gives Pam the bag of chips he owed her from earlier. Pam quietly takes them and stares in a forgiving manner after Jim leaves.

==Production==
[[File:Actor Lance Krall.jpg|Actor and comedian [[Lance Krall]] guest starred in the episode.|150px|thumb|right]]
"The Fight" was written by [[Gene Stupnitsky]] and [[Lee Eisenberg]], while [[Ken Kwapis]] served as the episode's director.&lt;ref name="episode"/&gt; The episode was the first entry of the series to be written by Stupnitsky and Eisenberg; it was also Kwapis' fifth episode directed.&lt;ref name="episode"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DVD2"&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=The Office: The Complete First Season |titlelink=The Office (U.S. season 1) |origyear=2005 |others=[[Ken Kwapis]], et al |type=on-screen |publisher=[[NBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode guest starred comedian and actor [[Lance Krall]], who portrayed Dwight's sensei, Ira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free radio 2 – Cast Bios|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/free_radio/season_2/cast.jhtml|publisher=[[VH1]]|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[B. J. Novak]], who portrays Ryan Howard in the series, noted that when the episode was being filmed, the majority of the cast and crew called it "'Karate', or 'The Dojo', since the most memorable scenes involve a karate fight."&lt;ref name=novakguide/&gt; Novak explained that the episode centered on the effects of procrastination "carried to the nth degree".&lt;ref name=novakguide/&gt; However, he noted that it was more memorable as "the episode in which Steve Carell and Rainn Wilson jump-kick each other in public to try to prove a point."&lt;ref name=novakguide&gt;{{cite web|last=Novak|first=B.J.|title=The Office Presents: Karate Kidding|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/blog-bj-novak-39929.aspx|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=June 13, 2012|date=Nov 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the cast members had experience in martial arts prior to the filming of the episode. Rainn Wilson used to study karate and is a certified yellow belt. Krall is a black belt in [[Taekwondo]] and was nationally ranked. One of background actresses who played a student in Dwight's class was actually a black belt, but was forced to wear a white belt; ultimately, she was unhappy about having to hide her ability. Eventually, she vented her frustration by "practically knock[ing] Rainn over when she kicked the pad he was holding", which was included in the episode.&lt;ref name=novakguide/&gt; During the filming of the episode, the protective piece of headgear that Wilson wore actually cut him.&lt;ref name=novakguide/&gt;

During the filming of many scenes in the episode, the cast and crew member kept breaking character and laughing. Jenna Fischer recalls that she had to film the scene where Ryan reveals that he is working on emergency contacts "about 20 times".&lt;ref name="jennablog"/&gt; In addition, Fischer noted that her and John Krasinski kept laughing "about a million times" during the kitchen confrontation between Michael and Dwight.&lt;ref name="jennablog"/&gt; During the dojo scenes, cinematographer [[Randall Einhorn]] and Krall "lost it" when Michael pinned down. In fact, shots of Krall (and several of the cast) laughing made it into the closing scene of the episode.&lt;ref name="jennablog"/&gt;

The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include brief shots of Dwight at the dojo and Michael and Dwight preparing to fight, Jim asking Dwight whom he could take on in a fight, Dwight discusses the result of the fight, Stanley confronting Michael about signing the forms, Michael saying that "no one ever lost their job for missing deadlines", and Michael delivering Pam the emergency contact information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date=2006 |title=Deleted scenes for "The Fight" | medium=DVD |publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] |location=''The Office: Season Two'' Disc 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
During the game of "phone tag", Michael impersonates [[Michael Jackson]], [[Tito Jackson]], [[Mike Tyson]], and [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref name="episode"/&gt;&lt;ref name=twp/&gt; In addition, several songs are alluded to. Michael sings "I don't want to work/I just want to bang on this mug all day" to the tune of ''[[Bang the Drum All Day]]'' by [[Todd Rundgren]].&lt;ref name="episode"&gt;{{Cite episode | title = The Fight | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (U.S. TV series) | credits = Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg (writers), Ken Kwapis (director) | network = NBC | airdate = November 1, 2005 | season = 2 | number = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim alludes to the Jets, one of the rival street gangs in the musical ''[[West Side Story]]'', by quoting the noted lyrics "When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way", as well as snapping his fingers in the same way as the gang members.&lt;ref name=twp&gt;{{cite web |last=Alli |first=Miss |title=The Fight |url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/the-office/the-fight.php?page=1 |publisher=Television Without Pity |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130203151545/http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/the-office/the-fight.php?page=1 |archivedate=February 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several popular quotes are misused in the episode: Michael consistently misuses the phrase "[[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]", and Dwight mistakes the phrase "[[tit for tat]]" as "[[breast|tit]] for tit".&lt;ref name="jennablog"/&gt;

Several noted films are referenced in the episode. After grabbing Dwight in a sleeper hold, Michael nonsensically shouts out ''[[Bedtime for Bonzo]]'', a 1951 movie starring [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref name="episode"/&gt; Michael notes that Dwight cried at the end of ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)| Armageddon]]'', a 1998 science fiction action movie starring [[Bruce Willis]].&lt;ref name="episode"/&gt; Michael's line "You talkin' to me?" is a line performed by [[Robert De Niro]] in the movie ''[[Taxi Driver]]''. Michael mis-attributes it to [[Al Pacino]] in ''[[Raging Bull]]''.&lt;ref name=twp/&gt; ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'' franchise is referenced two separate times. Michael notes that Dwight is the "Hilary Swank version", a reference to ''[[The Next Karate Kid]]'', the fourth movie in the ''Karate Kid'' series, starring Swank as the first female student of sensei Miyagi. Kevin later tells Dwight to "sweep the leg", a quote from the original movie.&lt;ref name="episode"/&gt;&lt;ref name=twp/&gt; The episode also contains several television references. Jim mocks Pam by doubting her status as an Ultimate Fighter; ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'' is a reality television series in the form of a martial arts competition.&lt;ref name="episode"/&gt; Michael turns the insult "queer" into a reference to ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'', a make-over reality television program featuring five openly gay men dispensing fashion and style advise.&lt;ref name="episode"/&gt;&lt;ref name=twp/&gt;

Erik Adams of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode a "B", and wrote that he enjoyed the way the important elements of the episode go "unspoken: Jim composes an apology email but doesn’t send it; the way the spectators are blocked during the main event at the dojo, there’s practically an entire office standing between Krasinski and Jenna Fischer."&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; Adams also enjoyed the way the episode wrote Pam's reaction, noting "is she generally uncomfortable, is she afraid of what Meredith might assume, or is she afraid of her own feelings?"&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Erik|title='Halloween'/'The Fight' {{!}} The Office {{!}} TV Club|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/halloweenthe-fight,99809/|work=[[The A.V.

{{refimprove|date=June 2014}}
'''''The Magic School Bus''''' is a series of children's books about science, written by [[Joanna Cole (author)|Joanna Cole]] and illustrated by [[Bruce Degen]].  They feature the antics of Ms. Valerie Frizzle and her class, who board a sentient [[anthropomorphic]] Type A [[school bus]] which takes them on field trips to impossible locations, including the solar system, clouds, the [[Time travel|past]], and the human body. The books are written in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] from the point of view of an unnamed student in "the Friz's" class. The class pet Liz, a [[lizard]], accompanies the class on their field trips.

Since the ''Magic School Bus'' books present scientific facts in the form of stories in which fantastic things happen (for example, the bus turns into a spaceship, or children shrink to the size of blood cells), each book has a page at the end detailing in a humorous manner which parts of the book represented scientific fact and which were fanciful storytelling.

== History ==
Craig Walker, vice-president and senior editorial director at Scholastic Co., stated that the concept began with the idea of combining science with fictional stories, and Joanna Cole (who had written both science and humor before) and Bruce Degen were then approached with creating such a series. Walker also states that his own memories of school field trips and of a teacher he had once, served as further inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/2947-two-decades-of-fun-and-learning-on-the-magic-school-bus.html |title=Two Decades of Fun and Learning on the Magic School Bus |accessdate=2012-10-03 |last=Lodge |first=Sally |date=2006-07-27 |work=Publisher’s Weekly }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first book "At the Waterworks" was written in 1985 and published the following year.

Cole and Degen started a new series called ''Ms. Frizzle's Adventures'' in 2001, which teaches [[social studies]]. There are now three books in that series. [[Microsoft Home]] started publishing ''Magic School Bus'' software in 1994.

[[Scholastic Entertainment]], the [[American Meteorological Society]] and the [[Children's Museum of Houston]] created a ''Scholastics the Magic School Bus Kicks Up a Storm'', a {{convert|2600|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. traveling exhibit funded in part by the [[National Science Foundation]], which premiered at the Children's Museum of Houston in 2003 (a copy of it opened in [[New Jersey]] the month after that).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/84Annual/techprogram/paper_66953.htm |title=Scholastics the Magic School Bus Kicks Up a Storm Museum Exhibit |accessdate=2009-03-23 |last=McCallum |first=Cheryl D. |author2= L. Nazarani |author3=The Children's Museum of Houston |date=2007-01-04 |work=ams.confex.com |publisher=American Meteorological Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
{{Main|List of The Magic School Bus characters}}

In the original books (the original series books), Ms. Frizzle's class had a larger number of students (or "characters") and consisted of Tim, Arnold, Ralph (changed to "Ralphie" on the show and later books in this series), Dorothy Ann, Wanda, Phoebe, John, Carmen, Gregory, Amanda-Jane, Florrie, Shirley, Michael, Phil, Molly, Rachel, Alex, Carlos, and Keesha (19 students). Phoebe was first introduced in the 1987 book, ''The Magic School Bus Inside the Earth'', and Carlos and Keesha were added in the 1994 book, ''The Magic School Bus In the Time of Dinosaurs''.

The homework assignments of all the students were seen in the books. In the TV series (and the TV tie in books and the original CD rom series from the video games), these assignments were included in early episodes and were usually presented by Dorothy Ann.

==Individual books==
The original Magic School Bus books are:

*''[[The Magic School Bus at the Waterworks]]'' ({{ISBN|0-590-40360-5}}, 1986)
**'''Topic:''' the [[water cycle]] and the [[waterworks]]
**Ms Frizzle's class is going with her on the most boring field trip, to the waterworks. At least that is what they think until they discover how interesting things always happen on Ms Frizzle's trips. After going through a tunnel, all the children find themselves in [[scuba diving]] outfits. On the top of a bridge the bus rises up in the air and into a cloud. Once in the cloud, the class finds that water droplets are growing, and they are shrinking. The class rains and lands in the water purification system. Eventually it takes them back to Walkerville Elementary, where they come out of the faucet in the girls' bathroom. Later, they see the bus outside and wonder how it returned from the cloud.
*''The Magic School Bus Inside the Earth'' ({{ISBN|0-590-40760-0}}, 1987)
**'''Topic:''' [[geology]]
**Ms Frizzle's class is starting a unit on geology and for homework every student has to find a rock, and bring it to school. The next day every child except Phil has an excuse, so Ms Frizzle decides to take the class on a field trip to collect rocks. The class starts digging until they, with the help of the magic bus, dig all the way through the center of [[Earth]]. They collect many rocks and learn about the different types. [[The Magic School Bus#Phoebe|Phoebe Terese]] first appears in this book as the "new kid". Before the show was even in production, the Magic School Bus appeared on PBS, because this book was featured on ''[[Reading Rainbow]]''.
*''The Magic School Bus Inside the Human Body'' ({{ISBN|0-590-41427-5}}, 1989)
**'''Topic:''' the [[human]] body
**Ms Frizzle's class is going to the museum to see an exhibit on the human body. However they stop for lunch at a park and Arnold takes too long to eat. When Ms Frizzle tries to hit the horn to tell him to hurry, she "accidentally" pushes a strange little button on the dashboard and the class finds itself inside a human body, but they are unaware that it is Arnold's. They go through the [[digestive system]] and [[Human brain|brain]] and out through the [[Human nose|nose]].
*''[[The Magic School Bus Lost in the Solar System]]'' ({{ISBN|0-590-41429-1}}, 1990)
**'''Topic:''' the [[solar system]]
**Arnold's know-it-all cousin Janet, is coming on the field trip this time.  They are going to the planetarium to see a show about the solar system, but it is closed for repairs. On the way back to school, they blast off and fly into outer space. They visit all the planets and learn about them, but in the asteroid belt, they lose Ms Frizzle and find themselves lost in space. The rocket bus featured in this book has become a symbol of the Magic School Bus series.
*''The Magic School Bus On the Ocean Floor'' ({{ISBN|0-590-41431-3}}, 1992)
**'''Topic:''' the [[ocean]]
**Ms Frizzle's class is learning about the ocean. It is really hot and the children just want a break. They are thrilled when she says they will take a trip to the ocean. However, when she gets to the beach she starts to drive into the water and they realise that when Ms Frizzle says "ocean" she means "ocean".  Believing the bus is in trouble, Lenny the Lifeguard decides to try to save the children and instead finds himself accompanying them on the field trip.
*''[[The Magic School Bus In the Time of the Dinosaurs]]'' ({{ISBN|0-590-44689-4}}, 1994)
**'''Topic:''' [[dinosaur]]s
**The children are turning their classroom into Dinosaur Land for Parents' Night, as they are studying [[dinosaur]]s. Ms Frizzle receives a letter from an old high school friend who is now a [[paleontologist]] and she decides to take the class on a trip to the dig. When she discovers that they are missing the bones of some [[Maiasaur]]s, she turns the bus into a time machine to travel back to the age of dinosaurs to find the bones. The class sees dinosaurs and learns the name of the different periods of the era and other information. This is the first time Ms Frizzle's first name is mentioned, and it is the first appearance of Carlos Ramon and Keesha Franklin, although Keesha was first seen in ''The Magic School Bus: On the Ocean Floor''.
*''The Magic School Bus Inside a Hurricane'' ({{ISBN|0-590-44687-8}}, 1995)
**'''Topic:''' [[weather]]
**The class is going to the weather station to learn about weather. However, on the way there the bus turns into a hot air balloon. Eventually they find themselves inside a hurricane. Ms Frizzle's radio proves an annoyance to Arnold in this book, as it seems to know his name.
*''The Magic School Bus Inside a Beehive'' (1996)
**'''Topic:''' [[bee]]s
**The class is now learning about [[insects]] and Ms Frizzle is taking her class on a trip to meet a [[beekeeper]], but they beat the beekeeper there. While they are waiting, Ms Frizzle accidentally pushes a small lever which turns the bus into a tiny beehive and the class (including Ms Frizzle) into bees. They explore the hive and learn about bees, but can they save the hive from a bear?
*''The Magic School Bus and the Electric Field Trip'' (1998)
**'''Topic:''' [[electricity]]
** The children in Ms Frizzle's class were sure that there was nobody like her, but that was before they met her niece, Dottie Frizzle. Dottie accompanies the class on their field trip to the town power plant. There the bus turns into a dump truck, and pours the children into the plant. They shrink and travel through the [[Walkerville (fictional)|Walkerville]] electric system.
*''The Magic School Bus Explores the Senses'' (1999)
**'''Topic:''' the five senses
**The class is learning about the senses and they are going to sing a song for an important teacher meeting. However, Ms Frizzle's personality and clothes make the class forget. Ms Frizzle thinks the meeting is tomorrow, but it is really today. So Mr Wilde, the assistant principal, decides to catch her so he can tell her about the meeting. He decides to get in a bus that just happens to be the magic school bus. The class decides to accompany him. They cannot let him drive that bus, not all by himself. Mr Wilde accidentally shrinks the bus and soon he and the class find themselves on a trip exploring the senses. Mr Wilde soon becomes obsessed with driving the bus and forgets all about finding Ms Frizzle, but the class does not.  Ms Frizzle's mother appears in this book.
*''The Magic School Bus and the Science Fair Expedition'' ({{ISBN|0-590-10824-7}}; 2006)
**'''Topic:''' famous scientists in history
**The first MSB book since 1999, ''The Magic School Bus'' celebrated its 20th anniversary with this new book published on 1 August 2006. Ms. Frizzle and her class have to find projects to display at the Walkerville Science Fair, and ''fast''. They decide to consult with famous scientists in history like [[Louis Pasteur]], [[George Washington Carver]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Marie Curie]], [[Isaac Newton]], [[Galileo Galilei]], even [[Albert Einstein]]. All the original characters are in this book.
*''The Magic School Bus and the Climate Challenge'' ({{ISBN|0-590-10826-3}}; 2010)
**'''Topic:''' climate change
**Ms. Frizzle takes the class on a flight in the bus over the arctic, showing them how the polar ice caps have melted since Ms. Frizzle's old copy of ''Our Wonderful World'' was published. They travel around the earth, observing the impacts of global warming and alternative energy sources. Returning to their home town, Ms. Frizzle gives the class special goggles to observe the greenhouse-gas molecules in the air. When the students return to school, they discuss things people can do to save energy and reduce carbon emissions.

"'''Tūtira Mai Ngā Iwi'''", or "'''Tūtira Mai'''", is a New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]] folk song (or [[Māori music|waiata]]) written in the 1950s by Canon [[Wiremu Te Tau Huata]]. The song became popular after being selected by New Zealand's [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]] for inclusion in schoolbooks.&lt;ref name=t&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/watch-daughter-tutira-mai-nga-iwi-composer-says-weve-been-singing-song-wrong-over-50-years |title=Watch: Daughter of Tutira Mai Nga Iwi composer says we've been singing the song wrong for over 50 years |publisher=TVNZ |date= |accessdate=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Huata wrote "Tūtira Mai Ngā Iwi" while part of an [[Ecumenical Movement]] in the late 1950s. He was driving from [[Wairoa]], [[Hawke's Bay]] with his children and passed [[Lake Tūtira]]. He would sing the lyrics and his children would repeat them, learning it as they drove to [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maoritelevision.com/news/national/kawe-korero-sings-tutira-mai-composers-daughter |title=Kawe Kōrero sings Tūtira Mai with composers daughter |publisher=Maori Television |date=2017-07-07 |accessdate=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waiata eventually grew in popularity through Huata performing it in churches and Bible classes. By the 1960s, the [[New Zealand government]]'s Ministry of Education picked up the waiata and started publishing it for use in New Zealand's schools without Huata's consent and didn't credit him as the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jesse Mulligan, 1–4pm |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/afternoons/audio/201849982/have-we-been-singing-tutira-mai-nga-iwi-wrong |title=Have we been singing 'Tutira Mai Nga Iwi' wrong? |publisher=Radio New Zealand |date=2017-07-05 |accessdate=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result after 50 years of being used in schools, his daughter revealed that some of the lyrics were published incorrectly.&lt;ref name=t /&gt;

== Rugby ==
In 2017, the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] started a campaign for the [[2017 British and Irish Lions tour]] for [[New Zealand national rugby union team]] fans to adopt "Tūtira Mai Ngā Iwi" as a rallying chant to try to outsing the [[British and Irish Lions]] fans. The campaign was led by the [[New Zealand Police]] constable and former All Black [[Glen Osborne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/video-all-blacks-star-turned-cop-glen-osborne-stars-in-brilliant-lions-tour-version-tutira-mai-nga-iwi |title=Video: All Blacks star turned cop Glen Osborne stars in brilliant Lions tour version of Tutira Mai Nga Iwi |publisher=TVNZ |date= |accessdate=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the attempt was poorly received by All Blacks fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11885005 |title=In The Lions' Den: All Blacks Tutira Mai chant hits a sour note |work=New Zealand Herald |date= |accessdate=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lions fans also hijacked the song changing the chorus from "Tatou, Tatou" to "Lions, Lions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gavin Mairs |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2017/07/06/lions-supporters-outnumber-blacks-fans-deciding-test-auckland/ |title=Lions supporters to outnumber All Blacks fans in deciding Test in Auckland |work=The Telegraph |location=London |date=2017-07-06 |accessdate=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-rugby-paper/20170709/282690457226303 |title=Lions win the song contest |publisher=The Rugby Paper |via=PressReader.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wall |first=Jamie |url=https://www.rugbypass.com/news/tale-two-chants-lions-tour-getting-louder-game/ |title=A tale of two chants: How the Lions tour is getting louder by the game |website=Rugbypass.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Zealand media criticised the NZRU for attempting to manufacture a favourable atmosphere, believing that "Tūtira Mai Ngā Iwi" was an inappropriate choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff-nation/94447518/tutira-mai-has-no-place-as-a-sporting-chant |title=Tutira Mai has no place as a sporting chant |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=2017-07-08 |accessdate=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Umbertina''''' (1979) is a [[feminist novel]] by [[Helen Barolini]]. It tells the story of four generations of women in one Italian-American family. It is the first novel by an Italian-American woman which explores, in depth, the connected themes of gender and ethnicity.{{sfn|Giunta|1999|p=427}}{{sfn|Pipino|2000|p=10}}{{sfn|Cornachio|1999}}

== Plot ==

'''Prologue'''

The prologue is set in Rome in the 1970s, with Marguerite, an American expatriate, in the office of her psychiatrist. Although living a comfortable middle-class life, Marguerite is floundering, without direction. She often thinks of her maternal grandmother, Umbertina, who had a "primitive strength" that Marguerite envies.

'''Part One: Umbertina, 1860-1940'''

At sixteen, Umbertina works as a [[goatherd]] in the hills above the [[Calabria]]n village of [[Castagna, Catanzaro|Castagna]]. She lives with her parents, brothers, and sisters in a one-room, dirt-floored stone cabin. Her father, Carlo Nenci, is a poor tenant farmer who toils for the Baron Mancuso di Valerba, an absentee landlord who takes half of everything produced by the villagers.

One day Giosuè, a charcoal maker from the next village, presents Umbertina with a heart-shaped holder for her knitting needles, which he made himself out of tin. Umbertina likes Giosuè, who has beautiful dark hair and eyes, but her father instead promises her to Serafino Longobardi, an older man who had fought in the [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Campaign of 1860|Campaign of 1860]]. Well in advance of the wedding, Umbertina asks the local priest's housekeeper, Nelda, to weave her a matrimonial bedspread in the traditional Calabrian style. It is the one valuable possession she will bring to her new home. She also asks Nelda for some [[rosemary]], hoping that once she is married she will at last have chicken to cook with it. Nelda tells her of an old saying: where rosemary thrives, "the women of that house are its strength."

Serafino buys a small plot of farmland, and Umbertina gives birth to three children. Oppressive taxes, high interest rates, and depleted soil make it impossible to break even. At Umbertina's urging, they decide to emigrate to America. They load their few possessions onto a donkey and, with a few of their neighbors, make their way to Naples where they board a ship for New York. For the next two years, the family lives in an overcrowded Italian ghetto. Umbertina takes in laundry while Serafino works as a laborer. They make the mistake of entrusting their meager savings to a fly-by-night immigrant bank, and are left with nothing. Umbertina sells her bedspread to a social worker, and the family moves to [[Cato (town), New York|Cato, New York]], where some of their old friends from Castagna have settled.

While Serafino labors at the railroad yard, the enterprising Umbertina begins selling freshly made pizza and panini to his co-workers for lunch. As the business expands, she leases farmland to grow fresh produce and opens a grocery store. She gives birth to five more children, including a daughter, Carla. The family business thrives, and the Longobardis become affluent and Americanized. On her deathbed, the elderly Umbertina has a vision of the lost bedspread with its intricately patterned design. Just before she dies, she asks her son for a cup of water from the spring in Castagna.

'''Part Two: Marguerite, 1927-1973'''

Carla's daughter Marguerite is restless, searching for something to give her life meaning. After college she travels to Italy, where she meets Alberto Morosini, a poet some twenty years her senior who comes from an old, established Venetian family. Planning to live together as artists, they marry and have two daughters, moving several times between Italy and the United States. While Alberto focuses on his successful writing career, Marguerite's attention is scattered. At forty-two she has an affair with a writer her own age, and uses her literary connections to try to help his career.

'''Part Three: Tina, 1950-'''

Marguerite's daughter Tina is living in New York when she receives the news that her mother has died in a car accident. She flies to Rome to be with her family. While still grieving her mother, she learns she is pregnant by her feckless American boyfriend, and endures a painful, illegal abortion. She begins spending time with Jason, a law student from an old, established New England family who is staying in Rome with his diplomat father. (Although Jason is a "Wasp," Tina thinks he looks Italian; his physical appearance echoes that of Giosuè in Part One.)

Tina struggles to choose a path in life. While touring southern Italy with Jason, she runs off with another man and visits her great grandmother's hometown. Unbeknownst to her, she ends up speaking to a descendant of Giosuè, who made the tin heart which she carries with her as a memento. She returns to the United States to continue her classical studies. One day she visits the [[Statue of Liberty]], and in the [[American Museum of Immigration|Museum of Immigration]], sees a beautiful Calabrian bedspread. Not realizing it once belonged to her great grandmother, Tina wishes Umbertina had brought something like that with her to America to pass down to her descendants.

Eventually Tina reunites with Jason and they become engaged. Unlike her mother, Tina is now able to commit herself as fully to a career as her fiancé. On a visit to Jason's family home in [[Wellfleet, Massachusetts]]&amp;mdash;not far from where an Italian [[Barque|bark]], the ''Castagna'', was shipwrecked in 1914&amp;mdash;she plants rosemary.

== Publication history ==

Barolini began writing about her grandmother in 1969, after traveling to Calabria to research her family's roots. She wrote ''Umbertina'' in 1976 after receiving a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] fellowship.{{sfn|Giunta|1999|pp=429-430}}

''Umbertina'' was first published in hardcover by Seaview Books in 1979 and marketed as a "family saga." Sales were respectable, but within three years the book was out of print. A paperback edition published by Bantam in 1982 was packaged in the style of a romance novel; the cover featured "three women, hair streaming romantically." It was republished by Ayer in 1988, but the type was so small it was nearly illegible.{{sfn|Cornachio|1999}}{{sfn|Giunta|1999|pp=425-426}}{{sfn|Ciongoli|Parini|1997|p=230}} Another paperback edition was published by the [[Feminist Press]] in 1999, with an Afterword by [[Edvige Giunta]]. An Italian-language edition was published by Avagliano in 2001.

== Reception ==

The novel was initially ignored by reviewers for mainstream publications such as the ''New York Times.'' Edvige Giunta attributes this partly to mistakes made by the publishers, and partly to "a literary establishment unable to conceive of a novel dealing with women's experience or Italian American experience as worthy of serious critical attention or a lasting place in American letters."{{sfn|Giunta|1999|pp=425-426}} 

''Umbertina'' is "the first Italian-American novel by a woman to deal explicitly with the intertwining themes of gender and ethnic identity."{{sfn|Pipino|2000|p=10}} It is also unusual in that it details the everyday struggles of working-class immigrants, which have traditionally been omitted from official historical narratives.{{sfn|Giunta|1999|p=427}} Literature professor [[Fred Gardaphé]] calls it a "seminal" work.{{sfn|Cornachio|1999}} Barolini herself describes it as primarily a feminist novel rather than an ethnic novel.{{sfn|Pipino|2000|p=10}} It has been included in the curriculum of various university courses in women's studies and Italian-American literature.{{sfn|Cornachio|1999}} Barolini received the Americans of Italian Heritage award for ''Umbertina'' in 1984 and the [[Premio Acerbi]], an Italian literary prize, in 2008.{{sfn|Premio Acerbi}}

In the film industry, '''unsimulated sex''' is the presentation in a film of [[sex scene]]s where the actors engage in an actual [[sex act]], and are not just miming or simulating the actions. At one time in the United States such scenes were restricted by law and self-imposed industry standards such as the [[Motion Picture Production Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms.html|title=History of Sex in Cinema: The Greatest and Most Influential Sexual Films and Scenes|last=Dirks|first=Tim|work=[[Filmsite.org]]|publisher=American Movie Classic Company|accessdate=4 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110213023/http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms.html|archive-date=10 January 2010|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films showing explicit sexual activity were confined to privately distributed underground films, such as stag films or "porn loops". Beginning in the late 1960s, most notably with ''[[Blue Movie]]'' by [[Andy Warhol]], mainstream movies began pushing boundaries in terms of what was presented on screen.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1043267,00.html|title=That Old Feeling: When Porno Was Chic|last=Corliss|first=Richard|date=29 March 2005|work=TIME|accessdate=4 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224174609/http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1043267,00.html|archive-date=24 February 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the vast majority of sexual situations depicted in mainstream cinema are simulated (in early pornography, the main actors engaged in simulated sex, with [[Insert (filmmaking)|inserts]] placed in the film), on rare occasions actors engage in real sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/01/movies/film-film-goes-all-the-way-in-the-name-of-art.html?pagewanted=1|title=Film Goes All the Way (In the Name of Art)|last=Hohendal|first=Kristin|date=1 July 2001|work=New York Times|accessdate=29 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209083623/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/01/movies/film-film-goes-all-the-way-in-the-name-of-art.html?pagewanted=1|archive-date=9 December 2010|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between these films and [[pornographic film|pornography]] is that, while such scenes might be considered [[erotic]], the intent of these films is not solely pornographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/oct/03/1|title=Coming soon to a cinema near you|last=Gerrard|first=Nicci|date=3 October 1999|work=Thihe Observer|accessdate=4 December 2009|quote=Catherine Breillat's controversial French film, Romance, has just been given an 18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification.

Notable examples include two of the eight [[Bedside-films|''Bedside''-films]] and the six [[Zodiac-films|''Zodiac''-films]] from the 1970s, all of which were produced in Denmark and had many pornographic sex scenes, but were nevertheless considered mainstream films (they all had mainstream casts and crews, and premiered in mainstream cinemas).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Michael|date=November 2006|title=Legitimizing Illegitimacy: Identity Spaces and Markets for Illegitamate Products|journal=Organizations &amp; Markets Workshop|publisher=Chicago Booth|url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/workshops/orgs-markets/docs/jensen-legitimacy.pdf|access-date=4 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229175950/http://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/workshops/orgs-markets/docs/jensen-legitimacy.pdf|archive-date=29 December 2010|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of these films, ''Agent 69 Jensen i Skyttens tegn'', was made in 1978. From the end of the 1970s until the late 1990s it was rare to see hardcore scenes in mainstream cinema, but this changed with the success of [[Lars von Trier]]'s ''[[The Idiots]]'' (1998), which heralded a wave of [[art-house]] films with explicit content,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/feb/22/news|title=Explicit Euro-sex test for British censors|date=22 February 1999|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 December 2009|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204045908/http://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/feb/22/news|archive-date=4 February 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/27/entertainment/ca-38822|title=Graphic Sex Scenes on Film Causing Little Fuss--for Now|last=Wilmington|first=Michael|date=27 August 2001|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=4 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904151852/http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/27/entertainment/ca-38822|archive-date=4 September 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'' (1999), ''[[Baise-moi]]'' (2000), ''[[Intimacy (movie)|Intimacy]]'' (2001), [[Vincent Gallo]]'s ''[[The Brown Bunny]]'' (2003), and [[Michael Winterbottom]]'s ''[[9 Songs]]'' (2004). Some simulated sex scenes are sufficiently realistic that critics mistakenly believe that they are real, such as the cunnilingus scene in the 2006 film ''[[Red Road (film)|Red Road]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/london_film_festival/article651832.ece|title=Sealed with a Glasgow kiss|last=Dalton|first=Stephen|date=7 October 2006|work=The Times|accessdate=10 January 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationales==
In an interview after the release of his film ''Love'', when asked why audiences want to see realistic portrayals of sex, [[Gaspar Noé]] suggested it's really about power structures: "In most societies whether they’re western or not, people want to control the sexual behaviour or to organise it in a precise context. Sex is like a danger zone. Sometimes class barriers fall down and it scares a lot of people. It’s about states controlling their systems, like religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barlow |first1=Helen |title=Director Gaspar Noé explains why real sex scenes were filmed for Love movie |newspaper=Irish Examiner |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsfilmtv/director-gaspar-noe-explains-why-real-sex-scenes-were-filmed-for-love-movie-370409.html |accessdate=31 July 2018 |date=9 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731123354/https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsfilmtv/director-gaspar-noe-explains-why-real-sex-scenes-were-filmed-for-love-movie-370409.html |archive-date=31 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Franco]] has cited "aesthetics and personal reasons" for why he worked on ''[[Interior. Leather Bar.]]'' (2013): &lt;br&gt;

:I've been a part of professional mainstream film for 17 years, and then in addition to that, I am a citizen of the United States and, you   know, I am engaged with its mainstream culture, but I've also done a fair amount of studying queer theory or queer cinema classes. So I’ve found that my place, one thing that my position allows, is a way to bring these two worlds together and also question the rules of mainstream cinema or mainstream culture, to examine why things are made the way that they are, why some subject matter is presented in one way and not another, and how those things shape us as people, how it shapes our beliefs, how it shapes the way that we live. If we can question those things or introduce alternative ways of viewing lifestyles or whatever it might be in mainstream cinema or indie cinema or art cinema, I think it can only be for the good. If other voices or other kinds of discussions or storylines or narratives from different perspectives are introduced, it will only make us richer as a people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Logan |first1=Lynn (interviewer) |title=Unsimulated Sex: An Interview With James Franco and Travis Matthews |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/logan-lynn/james-franco-travis-matthews_b_3282986.html |website=Huffington Post.

==Production issues==
A few directors have openly discussed or written about the technical problems inherent in filming of actual sexual acts, particularly with actors or actresses who have never performed such acts on film. In an interview with ''BlackBook'', [[Gaspar Noé]] acknowledges that it is difficult for several reasons: an actor may not be able to get or maintain an erection in the presence of even a small crew, or on camera; either of the partipants may have a current partner. "So I've decided that the best way to show real sex is to cast two single people who used to be a couple."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Enter the Void' Director Gaspar Noé Uncensored |url=https://bbook.com/film/enter-the-void-director-gaspar-no-uncensored/ |website=Black Book |accessdate=31 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731093505/https://bbook.com/film/enter-the-void-director-gaspar-no-uncensored/ |archive-date=31 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Pornographic films re-edited for mainstream release==
Prior to the advent of home video, a number of [[hardcore pornography]] films were released to mainstream cinemas. In most cases, scenes of penetration were either cut out or replaced with alternate shots. One exception to this was ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'', which was released uncensored.

Examples of this type of hybrid release include ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1976 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1976), shot as [[X-rated]], but first released as an R-rated version—afterwards, the uncut version was released;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074113/maindetails Alice in Wonderland (1976/I)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409091306/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074113/maindetails |date=9 April 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Café Flesh]]'' (1982)—the R-rated version of this science fiction porn film was released to mainstream cinemas;&lt;ref name=Peary&gt;{{cite book |title=Cult Movies 3 |first=Danny |last=Peary |year=1988 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster Inc |location=New York |pages=52–56 |isbn=0-671-64810-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stocks and Blondes'' (1984), originally available as ''Wanda Whips Wall Street'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,313803,00.html What Blockbuster Didn't Bust Blockbuster's inconsistent ratings policy -- The video rental store cracks down on X and NC-17 rated films, but ignores racier unrated fare like ''Wild Orchid''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108144849/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,313803,00.html |date=8 January 2010 }}, Ty Burr, ''Entertainment Weekly'', 29 March 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Droid (film)|Droid]]'' (1988), originally released as ''Cabaret Sin'' in 1987.

==Films with unsimulated sexual activity==
The following mainstream films have scenes with verified real sexual activity, meaning actors or actresses are filmed engaging in actual [[coitus]] or performing related sexual acts such as [[fellatio]] and [[cunnilingus]].
This list does not include [[:Category:Documentary films about pornography|documentaries about pornography]], which may contain unsimulated sexual activity. For example, ''[[Inside Deep Throat]]'' contains approximately 20 seconds of unsimulated fellatio.&lt;ref name=Inside&gt;[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/i/inside_deep.html A Film Review by James Berardinelli].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4926">[[Image:Winder 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|A winder being used in the construction of a [[transformer]], at a [[technical college]] workshop.]]
A '''winding machine''' or '''winder''' is a machine for wrapping string, twine, cord, thread, yarn, rope, wire, ribbon, tape, etc. onto a spool, [[bobbin]], reel, etc.

==In textiles==
Winders are used heavily in [[textile manufacturing]], especially in preparation to [[weaving]] where the yarn is wound onto a bobbin and then used in a [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]]. Ball winders are another type of winder that wind the yarn up from [[Hank (textile)|skein]] form into balls. Ball winders are commonly used by [[knitting|knitters]] and occasionally [[spinning (textiles)|spinners]].

==Mechanized winders==
Winders have a center roll (a bobbin, spool, reel, belt-winding shell, etc.) on which the material is wound up. Often there are metal bars that travel through the center of the roll, and are shaped according to their intended purpose. A circular bar facilitates greater speed, while a square bar provides a greater potential for torque. Edge sensors are used to sense how full the center roll is. They are mounted on adjustable slides to accommodate many different widths, as the width increases as the center roll is filled. The sensitivity of the sensor depends on the required speed of operation.

==Types of winding machine==
[[File:Engineer inspecting the winding machine.jpg|right|thumb|An engineer inspecting the winding machine.]]
Winding machines are classified based on the materials they are winding, some major types are&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Good|first1=JK|last2=Roisum|first2=David R.|title=Winding: Machines, Mechanics &amp; Measurements|date=1 January 2008|publisher=DEStech Publications|location=Lancaster, PA|isbn=978-1-932078-69-5|pages=478|edition=1ST|url=http://www.destechpub.com/links/catalogs/bookstore/machinerymanufacturing-engineering-4/winding/|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Coil winding machine
*Film winding machine
*Rope winding machine
*Paper winding machine
*Foil winding machine
*Roll [[slitting]] machines
*spool winding machine
*cop winding machine

On the basis of working the winders are classified as follows
*Shaft or shaft-less winding machine
*Cantilevered turret winding machine
*Carriage style winding machine

==Available features==

===Automatic splice initiation===
The benefits of automatic splicing add up to significantly increased productivity, greater quality control and reduced waste. It consists of a tail grabber and automatic diameter calculated splice initiation technique. The precision shear wheel and anvil mechanism guarantees a clean cut and no overlap. The splicing technique is divided into two major categories based on the type of joint, they are, Butt splicing where adhesives are used and Lap splicing:lap joint by means of applying heat and pressing it.

===Web break detection===
Some winders have sensors built in to monitor the web (thread, wire, etc. that is being wound). There are three common types of sensors:
*Fiber optic IR measurement sensors
*Contact optic sensors
*Non-contact optic sensors
*Diameter roll Build rate calculation break detector or drum wrap detection  

An optical sensor is placed above or under the web to be controlled. Standard sensors are not affected by dirt, steam or temperatures up to 160 degrees Celsius. Optical sensors work by sending a beam of light at the web, and seeing if the light is reflected or not.

===Actuated knife cut-off===
It consists of a knife blade which is used to cut the web when the maximum roll diameter is reached. The knife blade is actuated either by means of pneumatic or electrical actuators.IT CO

===Manual or automatic roll change===
The rolls have to be changed when the maximum roll diameter is reached this can be achieved either manually or automatically. The unit consists of a regulating circuit, which detects the web speed and speed of the carriage. The regulator sets the web speed and speed of the carriage by comparing the web tension with an adjustable web tension set point.
Modern automated winders are capable of reasonable high speed roll set change and core introduction, 
Tissue winders making toilet roll can change over at running speed,
Paper and board winders need to stop the winding process to cut the sheet and glue the paper on to a new wind up core,
Top line winders introduce the paper core through a maintenance pit down stairs, with  web interruption time as low as 15 seconds,  
More traditional, winders actual web stopped set turn out change time can be as low as 45 seconds,
these modern change efficiency upgrades, make it possible for mills to maintain production over one winder for each paper machine and still carry out maintenance with out risk to product quality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4285">'''Wow Philippines''' (stylized as '''WOW Philippines''') was a tourism [[marketing campaign]] used to promote [[Tourism in the Philippines]]. The name of the campaign also served as the [[tagline]] of the campaign.

==Background==
Then [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]] secretary [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]] conceptualized the tagline "Wow Philippines" himself in 2002. The government agency then has limited budget allotted for advertising.&lt;ref name="notfailure"&gt;{{cite news|title='Wow Philippines' not a failure, ex-DOT chief of staff says|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/01/09/12/wow-philippines-not-failure-ex-dot-chief-staff-says|accessdate=24 May 2016|publisher=ABS-CBN News|date=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promotional campaign was based on the 24-month Visit Philippines 2003 campaign by the [[World Tourism Organization]] which aimed to encourage the [[Filipino diaspora]] to visit tourism sites in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="morethanusual"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bulacan|first1=Annabella|title='More than usual'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=12UVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yAoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6623%2C3401078|accessdate=24 May 2016|publisher=Manila Standard|date=30 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Tourism (DOT) then commissioned advertising firm BBDO Guerrero&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amaldo|first1=Maria Stella|title='It's more fun in the Philippines' - Spread the word, says DOT|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/its-more-fun-in-the-philippines|accessdate=24 May 2016|publisher=InterAksyon|date=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the implementation of the campaign. This includes the coming up with promotional materials and the addition of "More than the Usual" as a sub slogan.&lt;ref name="notfailure"/&gt;Also the "Wow" of the campaign slogan is meant to be capitalized which doubles as an acronym. The meaning of the acronym varies depending on the usage of the slogan according to the government agency. The following are some possible meanings given by the DOT are the following:&lt;ref name="morethanusual"/&gt;

{{Chinese|t=紫微斗數|s=紫微斗数|j=zi2 mei4 dau2 sou3|p=zǐwēi dǒu shù ([[China Mainland]])&lt;br /&gt;zǐwéi dǒu shù ([[Taiwan]])|l=[[Purple Forbidden enclosure|Zi Wei]] calculation}}
'''Zi Wei Dou Shu''' (Purple Star Astrology) is a form of [[fortune-telling]] in [[Chinese culture]].  It remains one of the most well-respected&lt;ref&gt;图解道教天文历算学·紫微斗数 (天下第一神数) by 林庚凡 {{ISBN|978-7-5613-4369-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  processes for laying out "The [[Destiny]] Path" or "Fate".

==Terminology==
* Zi Wei (紫薇) - purple [[Rosa multiflora]](薔薇), also known as Baby Rose, Rambler Rose. In the astrological world, this majestic color is related to spiritual aspiration. 微 is used for 薇 in ancient/simplifed Chinese writing. Noble rose referred to the North Star, the most prominent star in the sky.
* Dou (斗) - 北斗星 [[Big Dipper]] constellation, [[North Star]], Pole star. A prominent star that is approximately aligned with the Earth's axis of rotation. It is used as the coordinate to chart the sky. 
* Shu (数) - calculation.

In ancient times, Zi Wei Dou Shu was restricted to the exclusive and private consultation of the Imperial Emperors only as Zi Wei Dou Shu could provide an elaborate reading too detailed and classified. Thus, imperial astronomers used Zi Wei Dou Shu to delineate charts for the Emperor as the Emperor's destiny is bridged to and affects the destiny of his kingdom and dynasty. 
Among the stars used in the Zi Wei Dou Shu system, there is one main star while other stars revolve around it. The star is named the “Emperor Star” – Purple Star (紫微) which also represents the ruler (Emperor) of the kingdom. 
Zi Wei Dou Shu has been used by professional consultants and practitioners for the past 1000 years to determine one's destiny and as remedial Feng Shui strategies. Zi Wei Dou Shu has its unique feng shui philosophies and principles and is known as the “personalized feng shui”.

== History==
Zi Wei Dou Shu was created by a [[Taoist]] named Lu Chun Yang (呂純陽) during the [[Tang Dynasty]].  It was further developed by Chen Xi Yi (陳希夷) during the [[Song Dynasty]] and later on by Luo Hong Xian (羅洪先) during the [[Ming Dynasty]] to its present-day form.&lt;ref&gt;Fengshuifortunetelling.com. "[http://www.fengshuifortunetelling.com/zi-wei-dou-shu-1.html Fengshuifortunetelling.com]." ''Zi Wei Dou Shi.'' Retrieved on 2007-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its exact origin, however, is still debated among the different schools, and should not be taken as a guaranteed historical context.

[[Chinese Astrology]] has always been closely intertwined with [[Astronomy]]. Gifted astronomers and astrologers were recruited as officials to work in Imperial Courts during the [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynastic eras]]. In those days most astrological charts were crafted solely for the [[Emperor of China|emperor]], as his personal fate had a direct bearing on his kingdom. The court astrologers also played an important role in determining the successor to the throne.

Astrologers observed the stars and noticed that among so many stars, only one was seemingly stationary while the rest revolved around it. This star was named the "Emperor Star" (紫微星)--the celestial equivalent of the Emperor and known in the West as Polaris.

==Chinese Society==
As with all other forms of fortune-telling, the Chinese do not generally see astrology as an infallible guide as to what will happen, but more as a form of forecasting in detail. Destiny and fortune are structurally complex and are unlikely to be changed by a single element. An overly simplistic application of - for example - changing one's lucky colors and numbers is not expected to affect or change one's destiny in any significant way. Knowledge about events to come may allow one to gauge the situation and make decisions from a position of strength.  Zi Wei Dou Shu approaches the world and events from the idea that to view things in their proper context, it is important to recognise the "spiritual dynamic of the [[universe]]" to find the pattern of change that leads to "fundamental truth".

Lineage in Zi Wei Dou Shu

There are two lineages in Zi Wei Dou Shu. There is the San He lineage, and the Si Hua lineage. The Si Hua lineage is not commonly available to learn, and there are not many practitioners worldwide. However, there is currently an app book written in English exclusively for the Si Hua lineage. The Si Hua Flying technique is a powerful system in decoding the exact timing and causes of events. &lt;ref&gt;https://mdestiny.com&lt;/ref&gt;
