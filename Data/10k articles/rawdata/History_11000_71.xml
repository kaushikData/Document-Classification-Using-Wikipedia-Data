==Predictions for the 23rd century==

===Astronomical predictions===

====List of the long total solar eclipses====

====Other phenomena====
* 2209 and 2284: [[perihelion]] of [[Comet Halley]].
* May 27, 2221: near-Earth asteroid {{mpl|(285263) 1998 QE|2}} will pass Earth at a distance of {{convert|0.038|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name="Goldstone2013"&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2221: [[Triple conjunction]] of [[Mars]] and [[Saturn]].
* December 2, 2223: At 12:32 [[Universal Time|UTC]], Mars will [[occultation|occult]] [[Jupiter]].
* 2227: Pluto's orbit takes it closer to the sun than Neptune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/99/pluto990209.html|title=Pluto to become most distant planet|publisher=|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2238/2239: Triple conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn (whose last triple conjunction was in 1981).
* August 12, 2243: At 04:52 UTC, [[Venus]] will occult Saturn.
* June 11, 2247: [[Transit of Venus]].
* March 4, 2251: At 10:52 UTC, Venus will occult [[Uranus]].
* In 2252, the [[planetoid]] [[90482 Orcus|Orcus]] will have completed one orbit of the Sun since its discovery in 2004, based upon current orbital measurements which give it a period of 248 Earth years.
* August 1, 2253: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] occults [[Regulus]] (last occultation of Regulus by Mercury was on August 13, [[364 BC]]).
* June 9, 2255: Transit of Venus.
* 2256 to 2258: [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] will reach perihelion for the first time since discovery.

* In 2288, the planetoid [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]] will have completed one orbit of the Sun since its discovery in 2002, which, based upon current orbital measurements, gives it a period of 286 Earth years.

===Other predictions===
*2256: According to estimates made in 2006, the [[Centralia mine fire]], which ignited under the town of [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] in May 1962, may extinguish. The fire is expected to continue burning for at least 250 years as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;O'Carol, Eoin. 2010-02-05. [http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Bright-Green/2010/0205/Centralia-Pa.-How-an-underground-coal-fire-erased-a-town "Centralia, Pa.: How an underground coal fire erased a town"] ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]''. Retrieved 2014-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt;
*2300: The United Nations predicts that [[life expectancies]] in most developed countries will be 87–106 years, and slowly rising, though rising more slowly than before. However, these projections also show that life expectancies in poor countries will still be less than in rich countries in 2300, in some cases by as much as 20 years; the UN itself mentioned that gaps in life expectancy so far in the future will likely not exist, especially since the exchange of technology between rich and poor countries and the industrialization and development of poor countries will cause their life expectancies to fully converge with those of rich countries long before that point, similarly to how life expectancies between rich and poor countries have already been converging over the last 60 years as better medicine, technology, and living conditions became accessible to many people in poor countries. The UN has warned that these projections are uncertain, and caution that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate their projections.&lt;ref name=un-esa1&gt;United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.  ''[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf World Population to 2300]''.  2004. Executive Summary, Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*2300: The United Nations predicts the world population in 2300 to be about 10 billion, but any changes in future birthrates or in projections of future life expectancy could invalidate those projections as well.&lt;ref name=un-esa1/&gt;
*2300: [[Google]]'s plan to index all the world's information and make it searchable could be achieved, according to [[Eric Schmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Elinor |last=Mills |title=Google reveals its 300-year plan |url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/0,1000000097,39228011,00.htm |work=CNET News.com |date=2005-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617075311/http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/0%2C1000000097%2C39228011%2C00.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2300: No new [[PESEL]] numbers can be allocated, the number required by law for all Polish citizens.

== Easter ==
Unless [[Reform of the date of Easter|changes]] are made in the religious calendar, in 2285, the Western [[Easter]] will fall on March 22 for the first time since 1818, the earliest possible date on which Easter can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/easter.php|title=Dates of Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday|work=navy.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious predictions ==

===Judaism===
*According to Jewish Calendars, in 2214, [[Rosh Hashanah]] will fall on October 6 for the first time.
*According to one Jewish interpretation of [[Creation myth|creation]], Adam was created in [[3761 BC]]. It will have been 6,000 years since then in 2239, thereby initiating a spiritual [[Shmita|Sabbatical]] on a global scale lasting a thousand years (the 7th Millennium on the [[Hebrew Calendar]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bromberg, Irv. {{cite web|title=The Rectified Hebrew Calendar.|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/hebrew/rect.htm|accessdate=2007-10-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071128014547/http://individual.utoronto.ca/kalendis/hebrew/rect.htm| archivedate= 28 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same basis, the common assumption{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} in 16th-century Europe was that the current world would end in 2242. Even Nostradamus's well-known prediction that his prophecies would run out in 3797, first made in 1555 (see [[Nostradamus]] source-list), would seem to fit this tradition (3797 – 1555 = 2242).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Lemesurier, P., ''The Unknown Nostradamus'' (O Books, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to a number of Jewish scholars, the [[Year 6000]] (2240) of the [[Hebrew calendar]] is the latest time for the initiation of the [[Messianic Age]].

=== ''The Circle of Eros'' ===
''The Circle of Eros: Sexuality in the Work of William Dean Howells'' is a study of the nineteenth-century American author and editor William Dean Howells. The book discusses the sexual themes in his novels, essays, and autobiographies, and shows how he arrived at a positive view of erotic love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3044827?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104359804397|title= The Circle of Eros: Sexuality in the Work of William Dean Howells|publisher=JSTOR|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Seductress''===
Prioleau published ''Seductress: Women Who Ravished the World and Their Lost Art of Love'' in 2003. The book re-examines seductresses, refutes the negative stereotypes, and portrays the lives of such women as [[Cleopatra]], [[Lola Montez]], and [[Mae West]] as well as modern women. The book also gives romantic advice to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookpage.com/interviews/8231-betsey-prioleau#.U4YK3PmSxqU |title= BETSEY PRIOLEAU|publisher=Book Page|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book received positive reviews.&lt;ref name=CTB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-02-10/features/ct-prj-0210-swoon-betsy-prioleau-20130208_1_casanova-printers-row-womanizers|title= 'Swoon,' Betsy Prioleau's book about Casanovas, can't get past first base|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote that "whether one buys her argument or not, [''Seductress'' is] wildly engaging reading and faultless scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-670-03166-5|title= SEDUCTRESS: Women Who Ravished the World and Their Lost Art of Love|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The New York Times]] wrote that "in this glossy, steam-heated analysis of temptresses and their tactics, no historical chapter is too obscure to provide inspiration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/05/books/books-of-the-times-stop-purring-ladies-and-pounce.html|title=BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Stop Purring, Ladies, and Pounce|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Swoon'' ===
''Swoon: Great Seducers and Why Women Love Them'' is a non-fiction book which analyses what makes a man attractive to women. Prioleau uses biographies, fiction, and science to discuss the secrets of men throughout the history and today that make them great lovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wtvr.com/2013/03/19/virginia-this-morning-author-betsy-prioleau/ |title=VIRGINIA THIS MORNING: Author Betsy Prioleau|publisher= CBS 6|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SPI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/blogcritics/article/Book-Review-Swoon-by-Betsy-Prioleau-4380460.php |title=Book Review: Swoon by Betsy Prioleau|publisher= Seattle Post Intelligencer|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the whole, the book was well received. [[Jonathan Yardley]] reviewed the book negatively and wrote that it is "a breezy, once-over-lightly book about sex."&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; [[Library Journal]] wrote that, "with exceptional vocabulary and bright prose, Prioleau offers a thoroughly researched, irresistible look at the characteristics of historical and contemporary seducers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.libraryjournal.com/2013/02/books/nonfic/soc-sci/social-sciences-reviews-february-15-2013/|title=Social Sciences Reviews |date= February 15, 2013 |publisher=Library Journal|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kirkus Reviews]] called the book, "A fun, frothy complement to cultural historian Prioleau’s ''Seductress: Women Who Ravished the World''."&lt;ref name=KIR&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/betsy-prioleau/swoon-great-seducers/ |title= SWOON |publisher=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[http://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/cultural-and-critical-studies/popular-culture.html The Department of Popular Culture] at [[Bowling Green State University]] has been a leader in the scholarly movement to investigate popular culture since its inception in 1973. [[Ray B. Browne|Dr. Ray Browne's]] early efforts in the Department of English led in 1973 to the establishment of the Department of Popular Culture as an M.A. program, followed with the establishment of the undergraduate major a year later. Previously, in 1967, Dr. Browne had founded the ''Journal of Popular Culture''; and in 1969 he founded the scholarly association for the study of popular culture, the Popular Culture Association, which is now headquartered at [[Michigan State University]]. Through these innovative curricular and programmatic developments and the research and other professional activities of the faculty, the department has established an international reputation as the leader in the study of popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = About |url = http://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/cultural-and-critical-studies/popular-culture/about.html |publisher = Bowling Green State University |author = Department of Popular Culture |access-date = March 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular Culture House ===
On July 21, 2012, [[Bowling Green State University]] announced their plans to demolish the Popular Culture building that housed the department.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.sent-trib.com/front-page/former-home-of-bgsu-presidents-to-be-demolished |archive-url = https://archive.is/20140312235041/http://www.sent-trib.com/front-page/former-home-of-bgsu-presidents-to-be-demolished |dead-url = yes |archive-date = March 12, 2014 |title = Former Home of BGSU Presidents to Be Demolished |work = [[Sentinel-Tribune]] |location = Bowling Green, OH |date = July 21, 2012 |access-date = March 12, 2014 |last = Brown |first = Harold }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="popcbuildingdemo" /&gt; The Popular Culture building was home to four former presidents of the university before the Popular Culture department moved in.&lt;ref name="popcbuildingdemo" /&gt; The building was purchased by the university in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.northwestohio.com/news/story.aspx?id=787072#.UyTKQeh9SuY |title = BGSU Pop Culture Building Is Torn Down |date = August 10, 2012 |access-date = March 15, 2014 |publisher = [[WNWO-TV]] |location = Toledo, OH |last = Wening |first = Tim }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was formerly called Virgil House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.searshomes.org/index.php/2012/08/13/in-memoriam-bgsu-popular-culture-house/ |title = In Memoriam: BGSU Popular Culture House |date = August 13, 2012 |publisher = Sears Modern Homes |access-date = March 15, 2014 |first = Sears |last = Homes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2000 supporters protested the demolition plans of the Popular Culture building.&lt;ref name="popcbuildingdemo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bgnews.com/campus/supporters-of-popular-culture-building-gather/article_4de4f5cc-db65-11e1-8c4d-0019bb2963f4.html |title = Supporters of popular culture building gather |work = [[BG News|The BG News]] |location = Bowling Green State University |date = July 31, 2012 |access-date = March 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the protests were unsuccessful and the university continued with plans to demolish the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.toledoblade.com/Education/2012/08/10/Razing-of-BGSU-pop-culture-building-ahead-of-schedule.html |title = Bowling Green State University pop culture building razed |work = [[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|The Blade]] |location = Toledo, OH |date = August 10, 2012 |access-date = March 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was demolished on August 10, 2012, one week ahead of time.&lt;ref name="popcbuildingdemo"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.sent-trib.com/front-page/updated-demolition-of-pop-culture-house-begins |archive-url = https://archive.is/20130903111919/http://www.sent-trib.com/front-page/updated-demolition-of-pop-culture-house-begins |dead-url = yes |archive-date = September 3, 2013 |title = Demolition of Pop Culture House Begins |work = Sentinel-Tribune |location = Bowling Green, OH |date = August 10, 2012 |access-date = March 15, 2014 |last = Brown |first = Harold }}&lt;/ref&gt; The demolished Popular Culture house was replaced by a student health center.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.fox19.com/story/19210383/bgsu-to-demolish-popular-culture-center |title = BGSU to demolish popular culture center |date = August 7, 2012 |access-date = March 16, 2014 |publisher = [[WXIX-TV]] |location = Cincinnati |last = Miller |first = Tim }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Popular Culture department moved into Shatzel Hall, alongside the Asian Studies department.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

He is now best known for his photographs of [[Notting Hill]] during the period of West Indian migration to London; however, his subject matter has also included film stars and student protests, with his photographs having appeared in ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'', ''[[Harper’s Bazaar]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and in Italian and Swiss journals.&lt;ref name=Akehurst /&gt; His work has been exhibited at galleries including [[Tate Britain]], [[Museum of London]], [[Nottingham]] New Art Exchange, [[Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mocadetroit.org/exhibitions/wedge.html "Becoming: Photographs from the Wedge Collection.

==Early years==
Born in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Jamaica]], Phillips spent his early childhood with his grandparents in [[St. Mary, Jamaica|St Mary]] after his parents had migrated to Britain. He developed an early interest in naval matters: "We used to wait for the tour ships to come in and we used to try and sell them something or try and escort them somewhere or show them around Kingston harbour. At that time Kingston was a main shipping port in the Caribbean.... Every afternoon after school I used to go down to the pier and watch different ships coming in. It was the era of big immigration to England."&lt;ref name=Moving&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20131105204349/http://www.movinghere.org.uk/stories/story322/story322.htm?identifier=stories/story322/story322.htm "Charlie Phillips Story"], Moving Here Stories, The National Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 11, Phillips too made the journey from Jamaica to [[England]], sailing on the ''Reina del Pacifico'', a [[Pacific Steam Navigation Company]] passenger ship: "This was a one of my most memorable experiences.... We visited different ports.... We visited [[Cuba]], [[Bermuda]], and I saw [[Santander, Spain|Santander]] in [[Spain]] and we ended up in [[Plymouth]]. Ever since then I've had a fascination for ships and docks and the sea."&lt;ref name=Moving /&gt; 

He joined his parents in [[London]], on 17 August 1956, and the family lived among other West Indian immigrants in [[Notting Hill]], at the time a poor area of the capital characterised by [[Rachmanism]] and racism.&lt;ref name=Akehurst&gt;[http://www.nickyakehurst.com/photographers/CharliePhillips/biography.html Charlie Phillips page] at Akehurst Creative Management.&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips recalls: "I was an altar boy at a church called St Michael when [[Kelso Cochrane]] was buried [on 6 June 1959] – one of the biggest funerals in Notting Hill at the time. It was just after the [[1958 Notting Hill race riots|race riots]] and because my parents thought there would be trouble that's the only day I didn’t go to the procession. These were the days where for coloured people it wasn't safe to walk on the street, especially when [[Oswald Mosley]] was at his peak."&lt;ref name=Dazed&gt;Ashleigh Kane, [http://www.dazeddigital.com/photography/article/22362/1/documenting-london-s-african-caribbean-funerals "Documenting London’s African Caribbean funerals"], Dazed, November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips worked in his parents' restaurant "Las Palmas" in [[Portobello Road]].&lt;ref name=BlackHistoryStudies /&gt; He began his photographic career by accident when, while still very young, he was given a [[Kodak Brownie]] by a black American serviceman. Phillips taught himself to use it ("I bought a book from [[Boots UK|Boots]] on how to take photos and learnt from my mistakes")&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kraemer, [http://www.eastendcitizen.co.uk/2016/03/23/charlie-phillips-advice-morpeth-school-pupils-colliding-worlds-portman-gallery/ "Old school photographer Charlie Phillips tells student snappers to ‘take their art to another dimension’"], ''East End Citizen'', 23 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and began to photograph life in Notting Hill,&lt;ref name=itzCaribbean&gt;[http://www.itzcaribbean.com/arts_charlie_phillips.php Charlie Phillips biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010223042/http://www.itzcaribbean.com/arts_charlie_phillips.php |date=10 October 2009 }}, itzCaribbean.com.&lt;/ref&gt; making his prints in the family bathroom after his parents had retired to bed.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Steeds, [http://migrationmuseum.org/regrets-hes-had-a-few/ "Regrets? He’s had a few … A profile of Charlie Phillips, photographer and contributor to ''100 Images of Migration''"], Migration Museum Project, 26 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s–'80s==
After joining the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] for a while (serving as a [[galley boy]] and developing an interest in marine biology and maritime history),&lt;ref name=BlackHistoryStudies /&gt; Phillips travelled widely in Europe, to [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[France]] and [[Italy]]. Caught up in the protest movements of the late 1960s, he took photographs of the [[Protests of 1968|student riots]] in [[Paris]] and [[Rome]]. He worked as a freelance photographer for magazines and he had his first exhibition in [[Milan]] in 1972, entitled "Il Frustrazi"&lt;ref name=Photofusion&gt;[http://www.photofusion.org/exhibitions/how-great-thou-art-50-years-of-african-caribbean-funerals-in-london/ "How Great Thou Art – 50 years of African Caribbean Funerals in London"], Photofusion.&lt;/ref&gt; and portraying the lives of urban migrant workers.&lt;ref name=Akehurst /&gt; He also took [[paparazzi]]-style pictures of celebrities including [[Omar Sharif]], [[Gina Lollobrigida]] and [[Muhammad Ali]].&lt;ref name=Photofusion /&gt;

Returning to London after several years, Phillips lived "a bohemian life of squats and pop festivals".&lt;ref name=itzCaribbean /&gt; Described as "A card carrying member of the 'sex, drugs and rock n roll era'", he ended up a party where he took photographs of [[Jimi Hendrix]] but ironically could get no British news editor to publish them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aphrobrit.wordpress.com/2011/08/14/rooticalcharlie/ "Charlie Phillips gets 'Rootical' in London’s Portobello Road…"], APHROBRIT, 14 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cobbinah /&gt; Throughout the 1960s he documented aspects of urban life in Notting Hill and the shifts taking place in the cultural landscape, including racial integration and the birth of Carnival.&lt;ref name=ArtFund&gt;[http://www.artfund.org/news/2009/10/01/important-afro-caribbean-photographic-archive-acquired-for-museum-of-london-with-art-fund-help "Important Afro-Caribbean photographic archive acquired for Museum of London with Art Fund help"], Artfund, 1 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1980s, Phillips regularly took photographs that document West Indian [[funerals]], at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/postcodes/places/W10/lgimg.html?s=kvhyUMsFKt7 "A Black Funeral" by Charlie Phillips] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608180022/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/postcodes/places/W10/lgimg.html?s=kvhyUMsFKt7 |date=8 June 2011 }} at the [[Museum of London]]'s Postcodes Project.&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere, which have been collected together under the title ''How Great Thou Art: 50 Years of Afro-Caribbean Funerals''.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/jul/25/50-years-of-afro-caribbean-funerals-in-pictures "How great thou art: 50 years of Afro-Caribbean funerals – in pictures"], ''The Guardian'', 25 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 he moved to south London and opened a diner in [[Wandsworth]], Smokey Joe’s, that often featured in restaurant guides,&lt;ref&gt;Helen Fielding, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/eating-out-the-caribbean-cool-shoulder-1613976.html "EATING OUT: The Caribbean cool shoulder"], ''The Independent'', 2 April 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; running it for 11 years, while building up a collection of shipping memorabilia but not pursuing his career as a photographer, demoralised by not being able to get his work published.&lt;ref name=Cobbinah&gt;Angela Cobbinah, [https://angelacobbinah.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/533/ "Charlie Phillips: Photographer"], Thoughts, words and images, 25 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s–present==
=== ''Notting Hill in the Sixties'' ===
A revival of interest in the work of Charlie Phillips came with it being featured in an exhibition at the [[Tabernacle, Notting Hill]], in 1991, coinciding with the launch of his book of photographs ''Notting Hill In the Sixties''.&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Phillips, [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Notting-Hill-Sixties-Charlie-Phillips/dp/0853157510/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415321909&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Notting+Hill+In+the+Sixties ''Notting Hill in the Sixties''] (text by Mike Phillips), London: Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0853157519}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced by writer [[Mike Phillips (writer)|Mike Phillips]] (no relation), the book includes photographs of everyday life in the area, covering poor housing conditions, musical entertainment and political activism.

=== ''The Urban Eye'' ===
Curator Paul Goodwin, speaking of the work in the 2013 exhibition ''Charlie Phillips: The Urban Eye'' (a 2014 [[Deutsche Börse Photography Prize]] nomination),&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsevents.arts.ac.uk/39964/nine-new-cross-university-professors-appointed-at-ual/ "Nine new cross-University professors appointed at UAL"] (biography of Paul Goodwin, Professor of Black Art and Design), [[University of the Arts London]], 6 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; compared Phillips' significance to that of documentary photographers such as [[Markéta Luskačová]], [[Shirley Baker]] and [[Tom Wood (photographer)|Tom Wood]], saying: "Each photograph tells ‘other’ stories...about the rise of modern multicultural London and the migrant experience in the city."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/photography-and-film/art432473 "A view through the Urban Eye of Charlie Phillips at Nottingham's New Art Exchange"], Culture 24, 19 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the exhibition in the ''[[Nottingham Post]]'', Mark Patterson called it "a reminder of a London and an England that has almost been wiped out of existence by redevelopment; a country where the business-driven 'regeneration' imperative has squeezed out authenticity and local texture. And for London, read Nottingham and many other towns and cities."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Patterson, [http://www.nottinghampost.com/Art-Charlie-Phillips-ndash-Urban-Eye/story-18804299-detail/story.html "Art: Charlie Phillips – the Urban Eye"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107190303/http://www.nottinghampost.com/Art-Charlie-Phillips-ndash-Urban-Eye/story-18804299-detail/story.html# |date=7 January 2014 }}, ''Nottingham Post'', 25 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''How Great Thou Art'' ===
Phillips' most recent show, ''How Great Thou Art: 50 Years of African Caribbean Funerals in London'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://howgreatthouart.photography/ "How Great Thou Art" website.]&lt;/ref&gt; opened in November 2014 at Photofusion Gallery in [[Brixton]], curated by Eddie Otchere and Lizzy King, with support from [[Arts Council England]]'s Grants for the Arts Fund.&lt;ref name=filmsnotdead&gt;[http://www.filmsnotdead.com/2014/11/05/how-great-thou-art-50-years-of-african-caribbean-funerals-in-london-charlie-phillips-photofusion/ "How Great Thou Art: 50 Years of African Caribbean Funerals in London'': Charlie Phillips, Photofusion"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107130111/http://www.filmsnotdead.com/2014/11/05/how-great-thou-art-50-years-of-african-caribbean-funerals-in-london-charlie-phillips-photofusion/ |date=7 November 2014 }}. Film's not Dead.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dazed /&gt; 

''Hungry Eye'' magazine stated: "Photographer Charlie Phillips presents a sensitive photographic documentary of the social and emotional traditions that surround death in London’s African Caribbean community. How Great Thou Art represents a lifetime’s work by Charlie."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hungryeyemagazine.com/how-great-thou-art-50-years-of-african-caribbean-funerals-in-london/ "How Great Thou Art: 50 Years Of African Caribbean Funerals In London"], Hungry Eye, 20 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer for ''The Root'' praised the exhibition as "a collection of beautifully evocative, powerfully elegiac images", describing Phillips as "a rare breed who combines the adventurous, pioneering spirit and perennial resilience of the hardy immigrant (he came to Britain in the 1950s) with the sensitive eye of the aesthete and a longing to transmute the banal, the prosaic and the unpalatable in ordinary existence into a thing of ineffable beauty."&lt;ref name=TheRoot /&gt;

Accompanying the publication of a limited-edition book of the same title (successfully funded by [[Kickstarter]]),&lt;ref name=filmsnotdead /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eddie Otchere, [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/151111416/charlie-phillips-presents-how-great-thou-art "Charlie Phillips presents How Great Thou Art"], Kickstarter.&lt;/ref&gt; ''How Great Thou Art'' has been called "a new landmark in British photography. The question of life and death and the cultural responses to death  through funerals in the Caribbean community has featured sporadically in various photographic oeuvres before but no one has explored this subject in such depth and in such a participatory and embedded manner as evidenced by Charlie Phillips."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Goodwin, "The Art of Charlie Phillips", foreword in ''How Great Thou Art: Fifty Years of African Caribbean Funerals in London'', King/Otchere Productions, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Spectator]]'', Ian Thomson wrote: "In Phillips’s moving and often beautiful images, dating from 1962 to the present, the bereaved are seen to face the mystery of the end of life in stush black suits, spidery hat veils, Rastafari head-ties, spiffy trilbies and strictly-come-dancehall white socks.... Anyone feeling a bit like death in the run-up to Christmas should invest in a copy of ''How Great Thou Art'' — and feel revivified."&lt;ref&gt;Ian Thomson, [http://new.spectator.co.uk/2014/11/death-wears-bling-the-glory-of-londons-caribbean-funerals/ "Death wears bling: the glory of London’s Caribbean funerals"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117064149/http://new.spectator.co.uk/2014/11/death-wears-bling-the-glory-of-londons-caribbean-funerals/ |date=17 November 2015 }}, ''The Spectator'', 29 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Heart of the Community''===
Phillips is featured in the art installation by Peter Dunn commissioned by the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]] on the Portobello Road north wall, in a series of photomurals celebrating key personalities, history and events of the Golborne and Portobello area over the past hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://citylivinglocallife.wordpress.com/2014/12/19/heart-of-the-community-portobello-road-arts-project-launches/ "Heart of the Community: Portobello Road Arts Project launches"], City Living, Local Life, 19 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/leisureandlibraries/culture/artsservices/portobelloroadartsproject.aspx "Peter Dunn: Heart of the Community"], Portobello Road Art Project.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dunn, [http://www.arte-ofchange.com/content/portobello-wall-heart-of-community-0 "Portobello Wall, Heart of the Community"], ART.e @ the Art of Change — Art in the Public Domain UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3089">The '''Classical Association of the Middle West and South''' ('''CAMWS''') is a professional organization for classicists and non-classicists at all levels of instruction which promotes the Classics through the broad scope of its annual meeting, through its publication of both original research and pedagogical contributions in ''[[The Classical Journal]]'' and ''[[Teaching Classical Languages]]'' and through its awards, scholarships, and outreach initiatives.

CAMWS was founded at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1905 as the first regional classical organization in the United States of America. It immediately began publication of the Classical Journal, which became only the second classical journal (excluding annuals) in the country. Twenty-two states belonged at CAMWS' inception; there are now thirty-two states and three Canadian provinces. CAMWS is an educational, non-profit organization, the largest of all regional Classical groups; membership is open to anyone with Classical interests, regardless of place of residence. Its members (c. 1,500) are primarily college and university professors, K-12 teachers, and graduate students whose specialty is [[Classics]]: Classical languages ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]) and the world of ancient Greece and Rome. Departments of Classics at colleges and universities, high schools which teach Latin, publishers and other classical organizations are also welcome to join CAMWS as institutional members.

A committee of CAMWS, the Committee for the Promotion of Latin (CPL), serves as CAMWS' arm for public outreach.

CAMWS offers a variety of awards and scholarships, including 
the Bolchazy Pedagogy Book Prize, 
CPL Promotional Activity Award, 
CAMWS New Teacher Awards, 
CAMWS Travel Grant For High School Groups, 
Excavation/Field School Award, 
Faculty-Undergraduate Collaborative Research Grant, 
CAMWS First Book Award, 
Manson A. Stewart Undergraduate Awards, 
Manson A. Stewart Teacher Training and Travel Awards, 
Outstanding Accomplishment in High School or Undergraduate Classical Studies, 
Ovationes, 
Phinney Book Prize, 
Presidential Award for Outstanding Graduate Student Paper, 
School Awards (Latin Translation Contest), 
Semple, Grant, and Benario Awards, 
Special Service Award, and 
Teaching Awards for both high school and college/university teachers&lt;ref&gt;https://camws.org/awards/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

CAMWS holds its annual meeting in the March or April. In odd-numbered years the annual meeting is held in a northern or western state or in Canada. In even-numbered years it is held in a southern state.

CAMWS is a member of the ''[[Society for Classical Studies]]'', the ''[[National Humanities Alliance]]'' and the ''[[International Federation of Associations of Classical Studies]]'' (FIEC).

The '''Communist insurgency in Thailand''' was a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] lasting from 1965 until 1983, fought mainly by the [[Communist Party of Thailand]] (CPT) and the government of [[Thailand]]. The war declined in 1980 following the declaration of an amnesty and by 1983 the CPT had abandoned the insurgency.

==Background==
In 1927, Chinese communist Han Minghuang attempted to create a communist organization in Bangkok before being arrested.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt; [[Ho Chi Minh]] visited north Thailand the following year, attempting to organize [[soviet (council)|soviets]] in local Vietnamese communities.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt; In the aftermath of the [[Siamese revolution of 1932]], conservative Prime Minister [[Phraya Manopakorn Nititada|Phraya Manopakorn]] accused his political opponent, [[Pridi Panomyong]], of being a communist and shortly afterwards a law was passed criminalising communism.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt;

During [[World War II]] communists formed an alliance with the [[Free Thai Movement]]. In 1946, Pridi Panomyong assumed office, repealing the Anti-Communist Act of 1933 and establishing diplomatic relations with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt; In 1960, North Vietnam created a training camp for Thai and Laotian volunteers in [[Hoa Binh Province]], [[Vietnam]]. A total of 400 people attended the camp in its first year of operation.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt;

In 1949, [[Pridi Phanomyong]]'s [[Palace Rebellion|attempt]] to return to power after the [[Siamese coup d'état of 1947|1947 coup d'état]] was crushed. The suppression of the [[Palace Rebellion|"palace rebellion"]] convinced the CPT leadership that better preparations had to be made in order for a future rebellion to succeed.&lt;ref name=PIT/&gt;

The failure of the 1952 [[Peace Rebellion]] was followed by the 13 November 1952 Anti-Communist Act. The act was sparked by the spontaneous involvement of a small number of communist party members in the rebellion.&lt;ref name=PIT/&gt;

During the course of the [[Korean War]], the CPT continued to stockpile weaponry in rural areas and make general preparations for armed struggle. At the same time, the CPT formed the [[Peace Committee of Thailand]], a [[Pacifism|pacifist movement]] operating mainly in urban areas. The Peace Committee contributed to CPT's expansion and the rise of [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American sentiment]] in the country.&lt;ref name=PIT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/southeast-asia-centre/documents/pdf/takahashi-katsuyuki.pdf|title=How did the Communist Party of Thailand extend a United Front? |work=|author=Takahashi Katsuyuki|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideologically, the CPT aligned with [[Maoism]] and during the [[Sino-Soviet split]] the party sided with the [[Communist Party of China]]. In October 1964, the organization declared its position in a congratulatory message on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the foundation of the People's Republic of China,&lt;ref name=AUK&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/milreview/marks.pdf|title=Anatomy of a Counterinsurgency Victory|date=January 2007|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following month a group of Thai communists formed the [[Thailand Independence Movement]] in [[Peking]], China.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt;

On 8 December 1964, the Thailand Independence Movement issued a manifesto demanding the removal of US military personnel from Thailand and calling for regime change. The manifesto was later also broadcast by Radio Peking.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt; Former Thai army officer Phayon Chulanont established the Thai Patriotic Front, another Thai communist organization, on 1 January 1965.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt; The two parties formed the [[Thai United Patriotic Front]] on 15 December 1966. [[Hill tribe (Thailand)|Hill tribesmen]], as well as the Chinese and Vietnamese ethnic minorities, formed the backbone of the movement.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt;

==Conflict==
In the early-1950s, a group of 50 Thai communists traveled to [[Beijing]], where they received training in ideology and propaganda. In 1961, small groups of Pathet Lao insurgents infiltrated north Thailand. Local communist party cells were organized and volunteers were sent to Chinese, Laotian, and North Vietnamese training camps, where training focused on armed struggle and terror tactics to fight capitalism in the region. Between 1962 and 1965, 350 Thai nationals underwent an eight-month training course in North Vietnam. The guerrillas initially possessed only limited a limited number of [[flintlock]]s as well as French, Chinese, and Japanese weapons. In the first half of 1965, the rebels smuggled approximately 3,000 US-made weapons and 90,000 rounds of ammunition from Laos. The shipment, originally supplied to the US-supported [[Royal Lao Armed Forces]], was instead sold to smugglers who in turn traded the weapons to the CPT.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000012498.pdf|title=Communist Insurgency In Thailand|work=CIA Report|date=|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koplo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nautilus.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/717-Wilfred-D.-Koplowitz.pdf|title=A Profile of Communist Insurgency-The Case of Thailand|work=The Senior Seminar in Foreign Policy 1966-67|author=Wilfred Koplowitz|date=April 1967|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1961 and 1965, insurgents carried out 17 political assassinations. They avoided full scale guerrilla warfare until the summer of 1965, when militants began engaging Thai security forces. A total of 13 clashes were recorded during that period.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; The second half of 1965 was marked by a further 25 violent incidents,&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; and starting in November 1965, [[Communist Party of Thailand]] insurgents began undertaking more elaborate operations, including an ambush on a Thai police patrol outside [[Mukdahan]], at that time in [[Nakhon Phanom Province]].&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt;

The insurgency spread to other parts of Thailand in 1966, although 90 percent of insurgency-related incidents occurred in the northeast of the country.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; On 14 January 1966, a spokesman representing the [[Thai Patriotic Front]] called for the start of a "people's war" in Thailand. The statement marked an escalation of violence in the conflict, and in early April 1966 rebels killed 16 Thai soldiers and wounded 13 others during clashes in [[Chiang Rai Province]].&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt; A total of 45 security personnel and 65 civilians were killed by insurgent attacks during the first half of 1966.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt;

Despite insurgent attacks on the 24,470 [[United States Air Force]] personnel housed on bases in Thailand, American involvement in the conflict remained limited.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

Following the defeat of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]], its 49th Division crossed into Thailand from neighboring [[Yunnan]]. The Chinese troops quickly integrated into Thai society, engaging in the lucrative [[opium]] trade under the aegis of corrupt officials. Drug trade provided an important source of income for the local population, while at the same time nationalist troops cooperated with the government during its counter-insurgency operations. In July 1967, the [[1967 Opium War]] broke out when opium growers refused to pay taxes to the [[Kuomintang]]. Government forces became involved in the conflict, destroying a number of villages and resettling suspected communists. The newly transferred populations provided new recruits for the CPT.&lt;ref name=NiN&gt;{{cite web| url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/ethnic/Random%20Narratives/ThailandRN1.3.pdf|title=Thailand|work=Stanford University|date=19 June 2005|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February and August 1967, the Thai government conducted a number of counter-insurgency raids in [[Bangkok]] and [[Thonburi]], arresting 30 CPT members including secretary-general Thong Chaemsri.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt; Further arrests ensued in October and November 1968.&lt;ref name=MCA/&gt;

The Thai government deployed over 12,000 troops to the country's northern provinces in January 1972, carrying out a six-week operation in which over 200 militants were killed. The government's casualties during the operation amounted to 30 soldiers killed and 100 wounded.&lt;ref name=MCA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mca-marines.org/gazette/communist-insurgency-thailand|title=The Communist Insurgency In Thailand|website=Marine Corps Gazette|date=March 1973|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late-1972, the Royal Thai Army, police, and [[Volunteer Defense Corps|volunteer defence forces]] commit the [[Red Drum killings]] of more than 200&lt;ref name="Jularat101"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jularat Damrongviteetham |title=Narratives of the "Red Barrel" Incident |year=2013 |pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; (informal accounts speak of up to 3,000)&lt;ref name="Haberkorn186"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Tyrell Haberkorn |title=Getting Away with Murder in Thailand |year=2013 |page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zipple91"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Matthew Zipple |title=Thailand's Red Drum Murders Through an Analysis of Declassified Documents |year=2014 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; civilians who were accused of supporting communists in Tambon Lam Sai, [[Phatthalung Province]], southern Thailand. The massacre was probably ordered by the government's [[Internal Security Operations Command|Communist Suppression Operations Command]] (CSOC).&lt;ref name="Jularat101"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Summary of World Broadcasts: Far East, Part 3|publisher=Monitoring Service of the BBC|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only one example "of a pattern of widespread abuse of power by the army and enforcement agencies"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Sung Chull|last2=Ganesan|first2=Narayanan|title=State Violence in East Asia|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2013|page=259|isbn=9780813136790}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the brutal anti-communist operations of 1971–1973 that took an official death toll of 3,008 civilians throughout the country&lt;ref name="Jularat101"/&gt; (while unofficial estimates are between 1,000 and 3,000 in Phatthalung Province alone).&lt;ref name="Zipple91"/&gt; Those killed were accused of working with the Communist Party of Thailand.
Until that point, communist suspects arrested by soldiers were normally shot by the roadside. The "red oil drum" technique was later introduced to eliminate any possible evidence. Suspects were clubbed to a point of semi-consciousness before being dumped in gasoline-filled, used oil drums and burnt alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=[untitled]|work=The Bangkok Post|date=30 March 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peagam|first=Norman|title=Probing the 'Red Drum' Atrocities|work=[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]|date=14 March 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 200 litre red [[Drum (container)|drums]] had an iron grille divider with a fire below, and the suspect above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2004/06/politics-thailand-remembers-a-dictator/|title=POLITICS: Thailand Remembers a Dictator|date=18 June 2004|accessdate=29 June 2014|work=[[Inter Press Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October 1976, amid rising fears of a communist takeover similar to the one that had taken place in Vietnam, anti-communist police and paramilitaries attacked a leftist student demonstration at [[Thammasat University]] in [[Bangkok]], during an incident that became known as the [[Thammasat University massacre]]. According to official estimates, 46 students were killed and 167 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Handley, Paul M. ''The King Never Smiles: A Biography of Thailand's Bhumibol Adulyadej''. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-10682-3}}, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1979, amid the rise of Thai nationalism and the deterioration of [[China–Vietnam relations]], the CPT fell into serious turmoil. The pro-Vietnamese wing had eventually seceded and formed a separated faction called ''Pak Mai''.&lt;ref name=AUK/&gt;

Efforts to end the insurgency led to an amnesty being declared on 23 April 1980 when Prime Minister [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] signed [[Order 66/2523]]. The order significantly contributed to the decline of the insurgency, as it granted amnesty to defectors and promoted political participation and democratic processes. By 1983, the insurgency had come to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bunbongkarn|first1=Suchit|editor1-last=R.J.

'''Dalmau de Queralt i de Codina''', '''Count of Santa Coloma''' ({{IPA-ca|dəlˈmaw ðə kəˈɾal}}; died 7 June 1640, [[Barcelona]]), was a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] noble, [[viceroy of Catalonia]] between 1638 and 1640, who was assassinated by Catalan rebels at the beginning of the [[Reapers' War|Catalan Revolt]].

==Biography==
Dalmau was the son of Pere de Queralt and Icart Cardona i Luyando, first Count of Santa Coloma, and his wife Maria Codina.

He was named viceroy in 1638 by [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], after the resignation of [[Enrique de Aragón Folc de Cardona y Córdoba]]. During the years 1639 and 1640 he participated in the campaigns of [[Roussillon]] against the French as the adjutant of [[Filippo Spinola, 2nd Marquis of the Balbases|Filippo Espínola]], generalissimo of the armies of the Spanish monarchy on the frontier with France, in the framework of the [[Thirty Years War]].
His greatest victory was the [[Siege of Salses]].

Approved by [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[John L. Sullivan (Navy)]] on 29 December 1948, the post was not filled “for lack of funds” until 1951, when [[Thomas C. Mendenhall (historian)|Thomas C. Mendenhall]] of [[Yale University]] was appointed to the position. In 1953, [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Robert Bernard Anderson]] named the chair in honor of Fleet Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], recognizing King’s great personal interest in maritime history. The Ernest J. King chair was named and first filled during the tenure of Professor [[Clarence H. Haring]]. At that point, there was only one other named academic chair in the United States for the field of [[maritime history]], that held by the [[Gardiner Professor of Oceanic History and Affairs]] established at [[Harvard University]] in 1948.
	The Naval War College’s first permanent long-term civilian faculty member came in 1966 and its larger civilian faculty began in 1972. Between 1951 and 1973, the King Chair was regularly held as a one-year visiting appointment. It became a permanent faculty appointment in 1974. The position reverted to a visiting professorship in October 2016.

[[File:EMachinesM5405Laptop.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EMachinesM5405Laptop.JPG|thumb|Any unattended device, like the laptop depicted, is at risk for an evil maid attack.]]
An '''evil maid attack''' is an attack on an unattended device in which the attacker targets the device for [[malware]] installation or password retrieval with the intended goal of extracting the victim's data from their device. In order to protect data from unauthorized retrieval, many users implement a password, either on the bootloader or the operating system of their devices. However, somebody with physical access to the device can compromise the [[firmware]] on the system and have it [[Keystroke logging|log keystrokes]]. Thus, when the victim returns to their device and inputs a password, the compromised firmware remotely sends the password to the attacker, and the attacker can access the data on the device when it is once again unattended.

Due to the number of vulnerable devices (any unattended device) and ineffective security systems intended to prevent unauthorized access to the device, several detection and prevention methods have been created in order to mitigate the threat of an evil maid attack.

== Overview ==

=== Origin ===
A 2009 blog post titled "Evil Maid goes after [[TrueCrypt]]!" by Joanna Rutkowska, a security analyst, details a method for compromising the firmware on an unattended computer with TrueCrypt disk encryption via an external USB flash drive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isyou.info/jowua/papers/jowua-v5n1-4.pdf|title=Analysing Android’s Full Disk Encryption Feature|last=Gotzfried|first=Johannes|last2=Muller|first2=Tilo|date=|website=Innovative Information Science And Technology Research Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2009/10/evil-maid-goes-after-truecrypt.html|title=The Invisible Things Lab's blog: Evil Maid goes after TrueCrypt!|last=Rutkowska|first=Joanna|date=2009-10-16|website=The Invisible Things Lab's blog|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She coined the term "Evil Maid Attack" due to hotel rooms being a common place where devices are left unattended.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

D. Defreez, a computer security professional, first mentioned the possibility of an evil maid attack on Android smartphones in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He talked about the WhisperCore Android distribution and its ability to provide disk encryption for Androids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Notability ===
In 2007, former U.S. Commerce Secretary [[Carlos Gutierrez]] was allegedly targeted by an evil maid attack during a business trip to China.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24880526/ns/us_news-security/t/did-chinese-hack-cabinet-secretarys-laptop/|title=Did Chinese hack Cabinet secretary’s laptop?|date=2008-05-29|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left his computer unattended during a trade talk in Beijing, and he suspected that his device had been compromised.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although the allegations have yet to be confirmed or denied, the incident caused the U.S. government to be more wary of physical attacks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2009, [[Symantec]] CTO Mark Bregman was advised by several U.S. agencies to leave his devices in the U.S. before travelling to China.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/evil-maid-usb-stick-attack-keylogs-truecrypt-passphrases/|title='Evil Maid' USB stick attack keylogs TrueCrypt passphrases {{!}} ZDNet|last=Danchev|first=Dancho|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was instructed to buy new ones before leaving and dispose of them when he returned so that any physical attempts to retrieve data would be ineffective.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2017, former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] employee [[Edward Snowden]] created an app called "Haven" to detect an evil maid attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wccftech.com/nsa-snowden-turn-phone-guard-dog/|title=Edward Snowden Now Helps You Turn Your Phone into a "Guard Dog"|last=Shaikh|first=Rafia|date=2017-12-22|work=Wccftech|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of attack ==

=== Classic evil maid ===
The attack begins when the victim leaves their device unattended.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://images.secure.f-secure.com/Web/FSecure/%7B319382b2-a040-4c88-bd94-20eed01bf22f%7D_F-Secure-Evil-Maid-Guide.pdf?_ga=2.108141442.1259543769.1518690658-1494122846.1518690658|title=F-Secure's Guide to Evil Maid Attacks|last=|first=|date=|website=F-Secure|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacker can then proceed to tamper with the system. If the victim does not have password protection or authentication on their computer, an intruder can turn on the computer and immediately access the victim's information.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/651021/|title=Thwarting the "evil maid" [LWN.net]|website=lwn.net|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the device is password protected, as with full disk [[Encryption software|encryption]], the firmware of the device needs to be compromised, usually done with an external drive.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The compromised firmware often provides the victim with a fake password prompt identical to the original.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Once the password is input, the compromised firmware sends the password to the attacker and removes itself after a reboot.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In order to successfully complete the attack, the attacker must return to the device once it has been unattended a second time to steal the now-accessible data. &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Another method of attack is through a [[DMA attack]] in which an attacker accesses the victim's information through hardware devices that connect directly to the physical address space.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The attacker simply needs to connect to the hardware device in order to access the information.

=== Network evil maid ===
An evil maid attack can also be done by replacing the victim's device with an identical device.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the original device has a bootloader password, then the attacker only needs to acquire a device with an identical bootloader password input screen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the device has a lock screen, however, the process becomes more difficult as the attacker must acquire the background picture to put on the lock screen of the mimicking device.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In either case, when the victim inputs their password on the false device, the device sends the password to the attacker, who is in possession of the original device.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The attacker can then access the victim's data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Vulnerable interfaces ==

=== Legacy BIOS ===
[[Legacy system|Legacy]] [[BIOS]] is considered insecure against evil maid attacks.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cansecwest.com/slides/2013/Evil%20Maid%20Just%20Got%20Angrier.pdf|title=Evil Maid Just Got Angrier|last=Bulygin|first=Yuriy|date=2013|website=CanSecWest|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its architecture is old, updates and Option ROMs are unsigned, and configuration is unprotected.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Additionally, it does not support [[Secure Boot|secure boot]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to boot from an external drive and compromise the firmware.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The compromised firmware can then be configured to send keystrokes to the attacker remotely.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ===
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ([[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface|UEFI]]) provides many necessary features for mitigating evil maid attacks.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For example, it offers a framework for secure boot, authenticated variables at boot-time, and [[TPM Chip|TPM]] initialization security.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Despite these available security measures, platform manufacturers are not obligated to use them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Thus, security issues may arise when these unused features allow an attacker to exploit the device.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Full disk encryption systems ===
Many full disk encryption systems, such as TrueCrypt and [[PGP Whole Disk Encryption]], are susceptible to evil maid attacks due to their inability to authenticate themselves to the user.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tereshkin|first=Alexander|date=2010-09-07|title=Evil maid goes after PGP whole disk encryption|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1854099.1854103|publisher=ACM|pages=2–2|doi=10.1145/1854099.1854103|isbn=9781450302340}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attacker can still modify disk contents despite the device being powered off and encrypted.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The attacker can modify the encryption system's loader codes to steal passwords from the victim.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Any unattended device ===
Any unattended device can be vulnerable to a network evil maid attack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the attacker knows the victim's device well enough, they can replace the victim's device with an identical model with a password-stealing mechanism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, when the victim inputs their password, the attacker will instantly be notified of it and be able to access the stolen device's information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mitigation ==

=== Detection ===
Detection of an evil maid attack relies on the ability of the victim to know if the attacker is close to the unattended device.

Many tools, such as proximity alarms, motion detector alarms, and wireless cameras, alert the victim when an attacker is nearby their device, thereby nullifying the surprise factor of an evil maid attack.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/evil-maid-usb-stick-attack-keylogs-truecrypt-passphrases/|title='Evil Maid' USB stick attack keylogs TrueCrypt passphrases {{!}} ZDNet|last=Danchev|first=Dancho|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a low-cost solution can be to put glitter over the screw holes on the device so that the victim can know if the device has been taken apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cyware.com/news/evil-maid-attacks-could-allow-cybercriminals-to-install-a-firmware-backdoor-on-a-device-in-just-minutes-98496c75|title=Evil Maid attacks could allow cybercriminals to install a firmware backdoor on a device in just minutes {{!}} Cyware|work=Cyware|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an attack has been suspected, the victim can have their device checked to see if any malware was installed.

=== Prevention ===
Prevention of an evil maid attack relies not only on securing the firmware and hardware of the device but also ensuring the device is not left unattended.

Basic security measures such as having the latest up-to-date firmware and shutting down the device before leaving it unattended prevent an attack from exploiting vulnerabilities in legacy architecture and allowing external devices into open ports, respectively.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; CPU-based disk encryption systems, such as [[TRESOR]] and Loop-Amnesia, prevent data from being vulnerable to a DMA attack by ensuring it does not leak into system memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blass|first=Erik-Oliver|last2=Robertson|first2=William|date=2012-12-03|title=TRESOR-HUNT: attacking CPU-bound encryption|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2420950.2420961|publisher=ACM|pages=71–78|doi=10.1145/2420950.2420961|isbn=9781450313124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, TPM-based secure boot has been shown to mitigate evil maid attacks by authenticating the device to the user.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a9b3/3811f30c4986bc1071b10bbd30003d163333.pdf|title=Intel x86 considered harmful|last=Rutkowska|first=Joanna|date=October 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does this by unlocking itself only if the correct password is given by the user and if it measures that no unauthorized code has been executed on the device.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These measurements are done by root of trust systems, such as Microsoft's [[BitLocker]] and Intel's TXT technology.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Anti Evil Maid program builds upon TPM-based secure boot and further attempts to authenticate the device to the user.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Additionally, physical security must be ensured. If the device is under surveillance at all times, an attacker cannot perform an evil maid attack.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The device can also be placed inside a lockbox so that an attacker will not have physical access to it.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3180">'''George Martine''', the elder (1635–1712) was a Scottish historian of [[St. Andrews]].

==Life==
Born 5 August 1635, he was eldest son of James Martine (1615–1684), a minister of the [[Church of Scotland]] in [[Fifeshire]];&lt;ref&gt;Successively of [[Cults, Fife|Cults]] (1639), [[Auchtermuchty]] (1641), and [[Ballingry]] (1669).&lt;/ref&gt;  his mother—his father's first wife—was Janet Robinson, who died 13 September 1644, and his grandfather was Dr. George Martine, principal of [[St. Salvator's College]], St. Andrews. Martine became commissary clerk of St. Andrews in August 1666, and held the office till August 1690.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Martine, George (1635-1712)|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then he was deprived as a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] non-juror, refusing to pledge himself to [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=18226|title=Martine, George|first=Alexander|last=Du Toit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martine was secretary and companion to Archbishop [[James Sharp (bishop)|James Sharp]], who died in 1679. He succeeded his father in land at St. Andrews, in 1696, and died 26 August 1712.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; He was called "Martine of Clermont", after land he acquired in 1668 (also Cleremont, Claremont).&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger L. Emerson|title=Academic Patronage in the Scottish Enlightenment: Glasgow, Edinburgh and St Andrews Universities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBgq1_LgvJEC&amp;pg=PA446|year=2008|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2596-3|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=University of St. Andrews.

==Works==
Martine is known for the diocesan history ''Reliquiæ divi Andreæ, or the State of the Venerable See of St. Andrews'' (St. Andrews, 1797). This work, written in 1683, was printed from a manuscript copy in the possession of a descendant.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; The antiquarian [[John Paul Jamieson]] had early access to the work, which was edited and published by [[John Rotheram (natural philosopher)|John Rotheram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=14640|title=Jameson, John Paul|first=Mark|last=Dilworth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=24153|title=Rotheram, John|first=Isobel|last=Falconer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selections from a memorandum-book of household and travelling expenses with Sharp were printed by the [[Maitland Club]] (''Miscellany'', ii. 497).&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==
In June 1668 Martine married Catherine, eldest daughter of James Winchester of [[Kinglassie]], Fifeshire, by whom he had several children including  the physician [[George Martine, the younger]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Grigol Tsereteli''' ({{lang-ka|გრიგოლ წერეთელი}}; March 12, 1870 &amp;ndash; 1938) was a distinguished [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] scientist, one of the founders of [[Papyrology]], founder of the Georgian scientific school of [[Classics|Classical Philology]], Doctor of Philological Sciences, [[Meritorious Scientific Worker]] of Georgia, Honourable Professor.

== Life and works ==

Grigol Tsereteli was born in 1870, in [[St Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire]]. His father, Prince Filimon Tsereteli, was a well-known lawyer and public benefactor.

In 1893 Tsereteli graduated from the [[University of St. Petersburg]]. In 1893-1897 he was a Lecturer of the [[St Petersburg Archaeological Institute]], in 1897-1902 Associate Professor of the [[Humboldt University|Berlin University]] ([[Germany]]), in 1902-1905 Associate Professor of the University of St Petersburg. In 1905 he received a PhD degree in Classical Philology.

In 1905-1914 Tsereteli was a Professor and Head of the Department of Classical Philology of the [[University of Tartu]], [[Estonia]]. In 1914 he received a degree of the Doctor of Philological Sciences.

In 1914-1920 he was a Professor and Head of the Department of Classical Philology of the University of St. Petersburg.

In 1917 Tsereteli was elected as Corresponding Member of the [[St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] (now the [[Russian Academy of Science]]).

In 1918-1920 he was a Visiting Professor of the [[Humboldt University|Berlin University]].

In 1920-1937 Tsereteli was a Professor and Head of the Department of Classical Philology of the [[Tbilisi State University]] ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]). In 1923-1931 he was also Director of the Scientific Library of the Tbilisi State University.

Tsereteli was elected as Honorary Member of the Society of Papyrology of Germany (1918) and Honorary Member of the Berlin Institute of Archaeology (1927).

He was author of many outstanding scientific works in the fields of papyrology, classical philology and history of the old Grecian literature.

Grigol Tsereteli was a victim of the political repressions of 1937 in Soviet Georgia (the [[Great Purge]]). In 1937 he was jailed by [[Gosudarstvennoe Politicheskoe Upravlenie|GPU]], and he died in prison in 1938. Tsereteli is buried in [[Tbilisi]], in the [[Mtatsminda Pantheon]] of distinguished Georgian public benefactors.

===Presidential candidacy===
Guðni decided to stand for [[President of Iceland|president]] on 5 May 2016. His platform included support for a citizen initiative referendum provision in the Constitution.&lt;ref name=gudnilysir/&gt; Early polls showed significant support,&lt;ref name=olafur/&gt; and following incumbent president [[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]]'s decision to drop out of the race Guðni saw an increase in popularity reflected in various polls, which ranked him first with 67% to 69%, far ahead of other contenders.&lt;ref name=gudnisurges/&gt; Guðni was elected on 25 June after receiving a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] with 39.1% of the vote.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/lokatolur-komnar-ur-ollum-kjordaemum-0|title=Lokatölur komnar úr öllum kjördæmum|date=26 June 2016|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guðni was unaffiliated with any of Iceland's political parties.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b0e6d824-3b93-11e6-8716-a4a71e8140b0.html#axzz4ChWL9O9n|title=Iceland elects university historian as president|last=Milne|first=Richard|date=26 June 2016|last2=Correspondent|first2=Nordic|newspaper=Financial Times|issn=0307-1766|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing himself, Guðni stated that he would be a "less political president" than his predecessor Olafur Ragnar Grimsson due to a lack of political partisanship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Guðni has emphasized the importance of unity for the small Nordic nation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== President of Iceland ===
Guðni took office as President of Iceland on 1 August 2016.&lt;ref name="ndtv"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/political-novice-elected-iceland-president-amid-football-fever-1423480|title=Political Novice Elected Iceland President Amid Football Fever|date=26 June 2016|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|website=NDTV.com|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 48, Guðni became Iceland's youngest president.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Roughly one month into his term, Guðni had approval ratings of 68.6% in an MMR survey, the highest approval rating that this pollster has measured for the Icelandic President since its establishment in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mmr.is/frettir/birtar-nieurstoeeur/561|title=Ánægja með störf forseta ekki mælst hærri|last=MMR|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kjarninn.is/frettir/2016-09-05-aldrei-mlst-meiri-ngja-me-strf-forseta-/|title=Aldrei mælst meiri ánægja með störf forseta {{!}} Kjarninn|date=2016-09-05|language=is-IS|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early into his term, Guðni had to oversee negotiations to form a government in Iceland in the wake of the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2016|2016 parliamentary elections]] that took place on 29 October.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/02/iceland-pirate-party-invited-form-government-coalition|title=Iceland's Pirate party invited to form government|last=France-Presse|first=Agence|date=2016-12-02|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These negotiations were difficult, as no pre-election coalition had a majority, and all possible majority coalitions had parties with highly divergent policy positions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visir.is/skattamalin-ahyggjuefni-i-vidraedunum/article/2016161129765|title=Vísir - Skattamálin áhyggjuefni í viðræðunum|newspaper=visir.is|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ruv.is/frett/katrin-buin-ad-hitta-gudna|title=Katrín búin að hitta Guðna|date=2016-11-24|newspaper=RÚV|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visir.is/undirliggjandi-vantraust-og-ovissa-skapar-erfidleika-vid-myndun-rikisstjornar/article/2016161209735|title=Vísir - Undirliggjandi vantraust og óvissa skapar erfiðleika við myndun ríkisstjórnar|newspaper=visir.is|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://icelandmag.visir.is/article/negotiations-historic-five-party-coalition-led-left-greens-go-well-according-pirate-party|title=Negotiations on historic five party coalition, led by Left-greens, go well according to Pirate Party leader|newspaper=Icelandmag|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Guðni had approval ratings of 97%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/97-prosent-anaegd-med-gudna|title=97 prósent ánægð með Guðna|date=2016-12-18|newspaper=RÚV|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such high approval ratings for Icelandic politicians are without precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visir.is/vinsaeldir-forseta-i-tolu-sem-sest-eiginlega-aldrei-segir-professor/article/2016161229991|title=Vísir - Vinsældir forseta í tölu sem sést eiginlega aldrei segir prófessor|newspaper=visir.is|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guðni attracted international attention in February 2017 when he jokingly vowed to ban [[Hawaiian pizza|pineapple as a pizza topping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/02/21/iceland-president-denounces-pineapple-pizza-as-topping-the-real-pizza-gate-scandal-story/|title=Profile in Courage: Iceland’s President Denounces Pineapple As a Pizza Topping|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Religious beliefs===
Guðni stands outside organized religion, but was raised in the [[Catholicism in Iceland|Catholic]] faith. He left the [[Catholic Church]] due to its delayed and muted response to reports of criminal abuses by priests.&lt;ref name="morgunbladid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guðni"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hringbraut.is/frettir/gudni-th-sagdi-sig-ur-katholsku-kirkjunni|title=Guðni Th sagði sig úr kaþólsku kirkjunni|last=Hringbraut|access-date=2016-07-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605073052/http://www.hringbraut.is/frettir/gudni-th-sagdi-sig-ur-katholsku-kirkjunni|archivedate=5 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[credo]] is the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], "human beings are born free, equal in dignity and rights. Humans are endowed with reason and conscience and should act in the spirit of brotherhood towards each other."&lt;ref name=morgunbladid/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guðni"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jóhannesson|first1=Guðni Th.|title=Guðni Th.

===Family===
Guðni is the son of the teacher and journalist Margrét Thorlacius and the physical education teacher and coach Jóhannes Sæmundsson. His father died of cancer at the age of 42. He has two brothers, [[Patrekur Jóhannesson|Patrekur]], a former [[Icelandic national handball team]] player, who is coach of the [[Austria national handball team]], and Jóhannes, who is a [[systems analyst]].&lt;ref name=morgunbladid/&gt;

Guðni married [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Eliza Jean Reid]] in 2004 and they have four children together.&lt;ref name=maclean&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Meet Iceland's new first lady: Canadian Eliza Reid |work=[[Maclean's]] ([[The Canadian Press]]) |date=26 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple, who met while both were studying in the [[United Kingdom]], moved to Iceland in 2003.&lt;ref name=maclean/&gt; Reid became [[First Lady of Iceland]] when her husband was sworn into office.&lt;ref name=maclean/&gt; Guðni also has a daughter from a previous marriage.

==Ancestry==
On Tuesday 29 November 2016, in the Icelandic newspaper [[Morgunblaðið]], was published an article which revealed how Guðni is related to former US president [[Barack Obama]]. Every Icelander can trace themselves to the bishop of [[Hólar]], [[Gottskálk grimmi Nikulásson]], therefore Icelanders were able to see their own relation to Obama, though it is noted that the relation is abysmally small.

The chart was made and traced by an employee of [[ORG - Genealogy Services]] in Iceland which is run by [[Oddur F. Helgason]], a well known genealogist in Iceland.    
[[File:Skyldleiki Guðna og Obama.jpg|thumb|Chart showing the genealogical relation between the 6th President of Iceland and 44th President of the United States.]]

Morgunblaðið on Tuesday 24 January 2017, also published an article stating that Guðni was related to [[Donald Trump]], 45th president of the United States through their shared ancestry of [[Haakon V of Norway]]. As in the previous case, this was also according to genealogist Oddur F. Helgason, and all Icelanders can therefore trace themselves to Mr. Trump. &lt;ref&gt;[https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/culture_and_living/2017/01/24/donald_trump_is_related_to_most_icelanders_and_dani "Donald Trump is related to most Icelanders and Danish and Norwegian Royalty"], ''Morgunblaðið'', Tue 24 Jan 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Rowlands''' (1655–1723) was [[Old Church of St Nidan, Llanidan|rector of Llanidan]] on [[Anglesey]], and the author of ''Mona Antiqua Restaurata: An Archaeological Discourse on the Antiquities, Natural and Historical, of the Isle of Anglesey, the Antient Seat of the British Druids'' (first edition, 1723).&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{Google books|2gFNAAAAMAAJ|Mona antiqua restaurata}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes an early description of [[The Bridestones]].

==Life==
The son of William Rowlands, of [[Plas Gwyn]], [[Llanedwen]], Anglesey, by his wife Maud, daughter of Edward Wynne of [[Penhesgyn]], he was born in 1655 at Plas Gwyn, the seat of the Rowlands family. He received a classical education, took holy orders, and was presented on 2 Oct. 1696 to the living of Llanidan, to which three small chapels were attached.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Rowlands, Henry (1655-1723)|volume=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowlands never travelled far from home. He died on 21 November 1723, and was buried at Llanedwen church. By his wife, Elizabeth Nicholas, he left two daughters and three sons.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Rowlands investigated of [[stone circle]]s, [[Dolmen|cromlech]]s, and other prehistoric remains. He conjectured that Anglesey was the ancient centre of the Druids. His major work was ''Mona Antiqua Restaurata, an Archæological Discourse on the Antiquities Natural and Historical of the Island'' (Dublin, 1723). A second edition was issued, London, 1766, and a supplement with topographical details in 1775.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Rowlands also wrote a ''Treatise on Geology'' and ''Idea Agriculturæ: the Principles of Vegetation asserted and defended. An Essay on Husbandry'' (1764), based on personal observations. He left in manuscript a parochial history of Anglesey, written in Latin, ''Antiquitates Parochiales''; it was partly translated in the ''Cambro Briton'', and also published in the original Latin, with an English version, in vols. i.–iv. of the ''Archæologia Cambrensis''. The hundred of Menai only was completed.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Historia Normannis''' is a 12th-century [[historical reenactment|reenactment society]], primarily based in the UK. It currently has around ~40 active 'cells' across the UK, and a cell group in [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany, France]]. The society has an active membership of around 600, making it one of the largest societies in the UK. The group's primary focus is on the period 1135–1215. The society usually hosts a large event in the first weekend in May.

==Activities==
The society, like most in the UK, provides a range of combat displays and living history craft displays, as well as engaging in film-work and other promotional activities- often featuring in local press in locations where the group is highly active.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/10813264.Knights_in_shining_armour_battle_on_Southampton_Common/?ref=nt|Daily Echo Website]&lt;/ref&gt; They recently featured in Episode 4 of the UKTV series, Weekend Warriors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://yesterday.uktv.co.uk/shows/weekend-warriors Weekend Warriors on UKTV Website]&lt;/ref&gt; which followed the group's build-up to their annual event at [[Whittington Castle]].

==Membership==
The society accepts new members through any of the currently active cell groups in the UK and France. Details about joining can be found on the group's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normannis.co.uk  Normannis' Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hydraulic empire''' (also known as a '''hydraulic despotism''', or '''water monopoly empire''') is a social or government structure which maintains power and control through exclusive control over access to water. It arises through the need for [[flood]] control and [[irrigation]], which requires central coordination and a specialized [[bureaucracy]].&lt;ref name="Wittfogel"&gt;{{cite book

Often associated with these terms and concepts is the notion of a ''water dynasty''. This body is a political structure which is commonly characterized by a system of hierarchy and control often based on class or caste. Power, both over resources (food, water, energy) and a means of enforcement such as the military are vital for the maintenance of control.

== Civilizations ==

A developed hydraulic civilization maintains control over its population by means of controlling the supply of water. The term was coined by the [[German-American]] historian [[Karl August Wittfogel]] (1896–1988), in his book ''[[Oriental Despotism (book)|Oriental Despotism]]'' (1957). Wittfogel asserted that such "hydraulic civilizations"—although they were neither all located in the Orient nor characteristic of all Oriental societies—were essentially different from those of the Western world.

Most of the [[first civilization]]s in history, such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[History of Somalia#Ancient|Ancient Somalia]], Sri Lanka, [[Mesopotamia]], China and [[Pre-Columbian Mexico]] and [[Pre-Columbian Peru|Peru]], are believed to have been hydraulic empires.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The [[Indus Valley civilization]] is often considered a hydraulic empire despite a lack of evidence of irrigation (as this evidence may have been lost in time due to flood damage).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Most hydraulic empires existed in arid or [[desert]] regions, but imperial China also had some such characteristics, due to the exacting needs of rice cultivation.

The [[Ajuran Sultanate]] of the [[Horn of Africa]] was the only hydraulic empire in Africa. A hydraulic empire that rose in the 13th century AD, Ajuran monopolized the water resources of the [[Jubba River|Jubba]] and [[Shebelle River]]s.  Through [[hydraulic engineering]], it also constructed many of the [[limestone]] [[Water well|wells]] and [[cistern]]s of the state that are still operative and in use today.  Its rulers developed new systems for agriculture and taxation, which continued to be used in parts of the Horn of Africa as late as the 19th century.&lt;ref name="His 40"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FlL2vE_qRQ8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The History of Somalia |page=26 |accessdate=2014-02-14|isbn=9780313378577 |last1=Njoku |first1=Raphael Chijioke |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2013}}
Wittfogel argues that climate caused some parts of the world to develop higher levels of civilization than others. He is known for claiming that climate in the Orient led to despotic rule. This environmental determinism comes to bear when considering that in those societies where the most control was exhibited, this was commonly the case due to the central role of the resource in economic processes and its environmentally limited, or constrained nature. This made controlling supply and demand easier and allowed a more complete monopoly to be established, as well as preventing the use of alternative resources to compensate. However, Diamond {{Reference or Citation needed|date=October 2018}} points out that complex irrigation projects predated states in Madagascar, Mexico, China and Mesopotamia.

The typical hydraulic empire government, in Wittfogel's thesis, is extremely centralized, with no trace of an independent aristocracy – in contrast to the decentralized [[feudalism]] of medieval Europe. Though tribal societies had structures that were usually personal in nature, exercised by a patriarch over a tribal group related by various degrees of kinship, hydraulic hierarchies gave rise to the established permanent institution of impersonal government. Popular revolution in such a state was impossible: a dynasty might die out or be overthrown by force, but the new regime would differ very little from the old one. Hydraulic empires were only ever destroyed by foreign conquerors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}
 
Wittfogel's ideas, when applied to China, have been harshly criticized by scholars such as [[Joseph Needham]] who argued essentially that Wittfogel was operating from ignorance of basic [[History of China|Chinese history]]. Needham argued that the Chinese government was not despotic, was not dominated by a priesthood, had lots of peasant rebellions, and that Wittfogel's perspective does not address the necessity and presence of bureaucracy in modern Western civilization.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} [[Robert L. Carneiro]] was also critical of Wittfogel's theory, writing in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in August 1970: "This theory has recently run into difficulties.  Archeological evidence now makes it appear that in at least three of the areas that Wittfogel cites as exemplifying his "hydraulic hypothesis"—Mesopotamia, China, and Mexico—full-fledged states developed well before large-scale irrigation".&lt;ref name="Science 21 August 1970"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Carneiro |first= Robert L. |title= A Theory of the Origin of the State |url= http://www.anthonyflood.com/carneirooriginstate.htm | date=21 August 1970|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=169|issue= 3947|pages= 733–738  |accessdate=29 April 2015 |doi=10.1126/science.169.3947.733 |pmid=17820299}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[Mesopotamia]], Carneiro cited [[Robert McCormick Adams, Jr.]], who had concluded: "In short, there is nothing to suggest that the rise of dynastic authority in southern Mesopotamia was linked to the administrative requirements of a major canal system."&lt;ref name="Science 21 August 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="City Invincible"&gt;{{cite book| editor1 = Carl Hermann Kraeling | editor2= Robert M. Adams |title= City Invincible: A Symposium on Urbanization and Cultural Development in the Ancient Near East. Held at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, December 4-7, 1958. | date = 1960 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | page = 281| asin= B000OYXA5E }}&lt;/ref&gt; On China, which Carneiro called "the prototypical area for Wittfogel's hydraulic theories", he quoted [[Jacques Gernet]] who had recently written: “although the establishment of a system of regulation of water courses and irrigation, and the control of this system, may have affected the political constitution of the military states and imperial China, the fact remains that, historically, it was the pre-existing state structures and the large, well-trained labour force provided by the armies that made the great irrigation projects possible”.&lt;ref name="Science 21 August 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacques Gernet"&gt;{{cite book| last = Gernet |first= Jacques | others= Trans. Raymond Rudorff |title= Ancient China From the Beginnings to the Empire | date = 1968| publisher = Faber and Faber | location= London| page = 92| asin= B000BWHHEY }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turning to Mexico, Carneiro wrote: “large-scale irrigation systems do not appear to antedate the Classic period, whereas it is clear that the first states arose in the preceding Formative or Pre-Classic period”.&lt;ref name="Science 21 August 1970"/&gt; Of hydraulic empires generally, Carneiro commented: "This is not to say, of course, that large-scale irrigation, where it occurred, did not contribute significantly to increasing the power and scope of the state.  It unquestionably did.  To the extent that Wittfogel limits himself to this contention, I have no quarrel with him whatever.  However, the point at issue is not how the state increased its power but how it arose in the first place.  And to this issue the hydraulic hypothesis does not appear to hold the key."&lt;ref name="Science 21 August 1970"/&gt;

The same elements of resource control central to hydraulic empire were also central to Europe's colonization of much of the global South. Colonies were resource rich areas located on the periphery, and the contemporary models of core-periphery interaction were focused on the extraction and control of these resources for the use of the core.&lt;ref&gt;Myrdal, Gunner. 1957. ''Economic Theory and Under-developed Regions.'' London: Gerald Duckworth and Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; This was accomplished through a type of agro-managerial despotism with close connections to debates around hydraulic empire.

* In the ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' science fiction series, created by [[Frank Herbert]], water is a source of power and contention on the desert planet [[Arrakis]].  More importantly, a drug called [[Melange (fictional drug)|melange]], found only on that planet, is the key commodity in interplanetary commerce.  This makes whoever controls Arrakis ruler of a hydraulic empire on Arrakis and, by effect, the empire of the entire known universe.  At many places in the books some variant of the following is said of melange: "He who controls it, controls our destiny."
* In the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', the primary antagonist Dominic Greene plots a coup d'état in [[Bolivia]] in order to seize control of its water supply.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7797">'''Hélinand of Froidmont'''&lt;ref&gt;French ''Hélinand'' (or ''Hélinant'') ''de Froidmont'', Latin ''Helinandus Frigidimontis'', alternatively ''Elinandus'', ''Elynandus'', etc.&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 1150—after 1229 (probably 1237&lt;ref&gt;B.M. Kienzle, "Mary Speaks against Heresy. An Unedited Sermon of Hélinand for the Purification, Paris, B.N., ms. lat. 14591." In: ''Sacris Erudiri'' 32 (1991), pp. 291-308&lt;/ref&gt;)) was a [[The Middle Ages|medieval]] [[poet]], [[chronicler]], and [[ecclesiastical]] writer.

== Biography ==

He was born of [[Flemish people|Flemish]] parents at [[Pronleroy]] in [[Oise]] in [[France]] c. 1150; his date of death is said to be 3 February 1223, or 1229, or 1237. His talents as a [[minstrel]] won the favor of King [[Philip Augustus]], and for some time he freely indulged in the pleasures of the world, after which he became a [[Cistercian]] monk at the [[monastery]] of [[Froidmont]] in the [[Diocese of Beauvais]] about the year 1190. From being a self-indulgent man of the world he became a model of [[piety]] and [[Mortification in Roman Catholic teaching|mortification]] in the monastery. Whatever time was not consumed in monastic exercises he devoted to ecclesiastical studies and, after his [[ordination]] to the priesthood, to preaching and writing. The Church of Beauvais honors him as a [[saint]] and celebrates his [[feast day]] on 3 February.

Hélinand of Froidmont is sometimes confused with the Cistercian '''Hélinand of Perseigne''', the author of a commentary on the [[Apocalypse]] and [[Bible gloss|gloss]]es on the [[Book of Exodus]], although there are no arguments for this identification.&lt;ref&gt;See Voorbij (below)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==

=== ''Chronicon'' ===
Hélinand  is most remembered for his ''Chronicon'', a [[universal chronicle|world-chronicle]] in [[Latin]] containing forty-nine books (of which only less than half have survived), which he compiled from 1211 to 1223. Helinand incorporated several of his [[treatise]]s and [[Letter (message)|letters]] into his ''Chronicon''. These include moral treatises such as ''De cognitione sui'', and ''De bono regimine principis'', twenty-eight sermons on various Church festivals; one epistle entitled ''De reparatione lapsi'', in which he exhorts a renegade monk to return to his monastery. The ''Chronicon'' itself is largely a compilation of texts taken from a wide range of sources.

[[Vincent of Beauvais]] on his turn based his ''Speculum Historiale'', which provided a history of the world down to his time, on the ''Chronicon'' of Helinand.

Surviving parts of the ''Chronicon'' include Books 1-18, covering the period from the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] to the death of [[Alexander the Great]]; fragments from Books 19-44, surviving as copies in the ''Speculum Maius'' of Vincent of Beauvais; the text of books 45-49, which deal with the period from 634 to 1204. Books 45-49 of the ''Chronicon'' serve as a source for the chronicle by the [[Cistercian]] monk [[Aubri de Trois-Fontaines]] (Alberic of Trois-Fontaines) (c. 1241).

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], "his chronicle is not sufficiently critical to be of much historical value." Yet it would be unfair to call Helinand an uncritical writer - or rather, compiler - of history, as from time to time he interrupts the narrative to alert the reader where his sources diverge from each other, often trying to harmonize them in much the same fashion as a [[scholasticism|scholastic]] treatise. The structure of the ''Chronicon'' is mainly chronological, although Helinand frequently digresses from the historical account to comment on [[Scripture]], include a treatise against [[astrology]], write about saints and their legends, examine the animal world, or incorporate material from Latin literature or vernacular traditions. He is frequently quoted as a medieval authority on the meaning of the word "graal," i.e. the [[Holy Grail]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronique.com/Library/Knights/Grail.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818193956/http://www.chronique.com/Library/Knights/Grail.htm |date=August 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the ''Chronicon's'' value is not based on its existence as a work on history.  He is cited, for example, as a source of the description of the [[flight]] of [[Eilmer of Malmesbury]].

=== Lesser works ===
Helinand wrote a work in [[Old French]] called ''Les Vers de la Mort'' ("Verses of Death") shortly after entering the monastery, between 1194 and 1197. In fifty [[stanza]]s, Helinand asks [[Death (personification)|Death]] to call upon his best friends and exhort them to abandon the world. Each stanza contains twelve octosyllabic lines; the [[rhyme scheme]] is aab aab bba bba. This form was imitated by later poets and is called by critics the "helinandian stanza." In this poem, Death appears as a ubiquitous and hyperactive agent.  Helinand does not use macabre elements, except in the title, which puns on the [[homonymy]] between "vers" (worms) and "vers" (verses). His lyrical sermon uses various tropes such as [[anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]], [[metaphor]], and [[adnomination]] to great effect. Throughout this unique [[testimony]] of his poetic talent as a ''[[trouvère]]'', Helinand appears as a precursor of [[François Villon|Villon]], [[Le Chastelain de Couci|Chastelain]] &lt;!--Chastelain was from 12th-century not 15th-century --&gt;, and other French poets of the 15th century. {{clarify|date=October 2014}}

As a well-known [[preacher]], he wrote more than sixty Latin [[sermon]]s. His sermons, written in a neat Latin style, give evidence of a remarkable acquaintance with the pagan poets as well as with the [[Fathers of the Church]].

A ''Martyrium'' of Saints [[Saint Gereon|Gereon]], [[Victor of Xanten|Victor]], [[Bonn Minster#Cassius and Florentius|Cassius, and Florentius]], martyrs of the [[Theban Legion]] used to be attributed to Helinand, but it is unclear whether he is the true author.&lt;ref&gt;See Voorbij (below). Smits (1983) observes that the text was already in circulation before the 12th century and that the attribution must hence be false. See: E.R. Smits, "Helinand of Froidmont and the A-text of Seneca's Tragedies", ''Mnemosyne'' S. 4,), pp. 324-358 (p. 332).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ian James Forrester Mortimer''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100|FSA|FRHistS|commas=on}} (born 22 September 1967) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[historian]] and [[writer]] of [[historical fiction]]. He is best known for his book [[The Time Traveler's Guide to Medieval England]], which became a ''[[Sunday Times]]'' bestseller in paperback in 2010.

==Biography==
Mortimer was born in [[Petts Wood]], and was educated at [[Eastbourne College]], the [[University of Exeter]] (BA, PhD, DLitt) and [[University College London]] (MA). Between 1993 and 2003 he worked for several major research institutions, including the [[Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts]], the [[University of Exeter]] and the [[University of Reading]]. 

Mortimer has written a sequence of biographies of medieval political leaders: first [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March]], then [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], and [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], in addition to ''1415'', a year in the life of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. 

Mortimer's best known book, however, is ''The Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England'', first published in the United Kingdom in 2008. He is also well known for pioneering the argument (based on evidence such as the [[Fieschi Letter]]) that [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] did not die in [[Berkeley Castle]] in 1327 in his first two books and an article in ''[[The English Historical Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;For a synopsis, see: [http://www.ianmortimer.com/EdwardII/death.htm Ian Mortimer: ''A Note on the Deaths of Edward II''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortimer has also carried out research into the [[social history]] of early [[modern medicine]]. His essay "The Triumph of the Doctors" was awarded the 2004 Alexander Prize by the [[Royal Historical Society]]. In this essay he demonstrated that ill and injured people close to death shifted their hopes of physical salvation from an exclusively religious source of healing power ([[God]], or [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]]) to a predominantly human one ([[physicians]] and [[surgeons]]) over the period 1615–1670, and argued that this shift of outlook was among the most profound changes [[western society]] has ever experienced.

In 2011, Mortimer entered the [[genre]] of historical fiction, publishing the first book from his [[Elizabethan era]] ''Clarenceux Trilogy'' using the pen name of James Forrester. James Forrester are Mortimer's middle names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craney|first=Glen|title=Lies, Damn Lies, and Historical Fiction|url=http://historyintofiction.com/tag/forrester/|work=History Into Fiction|accessdate=15 February 2013|date=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Forrester|url=https://www.amazon.com/James-Forrester/e/B003VKEWEQ|work=Amazon.com|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mortimer is the nephew of the British tennis player [[Angela Mortimer]]. He lives in [[Moretonhampstead]], in [[Devon]], England.

==Honours==
Mortimer is a [[Fellow of the Royal Historical Society]] (FRHistS). On 12 February 2015, he was elected a [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London]] (FSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=12 Feb Ballot Results|url=http://www.sal.org.uk/news/2015/02/12-feb-ballot-results/|website=News|publisher=Society of Antiquaries of London|accessdate=21 February 2015|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6816">'''Jesper Lützen''' (born 8 October 1951 in [[Svendborg]]) is a Danish historian of mathematics and the physical sciences.

==Biography==
Lützen graduated in mathematics (with a minor in physics) in 1976 from [[Aarhus University]], where he also earned his Ph.D. in 1980 in the history of science under the supervision of [[Kirsti Andersen]]. In 1980 he was a visiting scholar at [[Yale University]] (studying under [[Asger Aaboe]]) and became a temporary lecturer (a temporary assistant professor position) at [[Odense University]] and from 1985 a lecturer at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. In 1990 he received his habilitation (Doctor Scientiarum) from the University of Copenhagen. There he has been a lecturer since 1989 and since 2005 a professor of mathematics history at the University of Copenhagen's Faculty of Mathematics. He has been a visiting scholar at Utrecht (studying with [[Henk J. M. Bos|Henk Bos]]) and at several other places: Paris, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s [[Dibner Institute]], the [[Mittag-Leffler Institute]] of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], the [[California Institute of Technology]], the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], and the [[University of Toronto]].

Lützen's research deals with the prehistory of [[distribution (mathematics) | distribution]]s (before their precisely-defined introduction by [[Sergei Sobolev]] around 1936 and [[Laurent Schwartz]] around 1950), as well as [[Joseph Liouville]] (whose biography he wrote) and [[Heinrich Hertz]] and Hertz's mechanics. The prehistory of the theory of distributions was also the topic of Lützen's dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124223255/http://css.au.dk/forskning/publications/pub/|title=Dissertations and Theses|website=Publications of the Center for Videnskabsstudier, University of Aarhus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a co-editor of the ''[[Archive for History of Exact Sciences]]'', ''[[Historia Mathematica]]'', and the ''Revue d'histoire des mathématiques'', as well as [[Springer Verlag]]'s book series ''Archimedes: New Sources and Studies in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences'' with series editor [[Jed Buchwald]].

In 1990, Lützen was an Invited Speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Kyoto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Birth of Spectral Theory — Joseph Liouville's Contributions|author=Lützen, Jesper|title=Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Kyoto, 1990|year=1992|pages=1651–1663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1993 he has been a full member of the [[International Academy of the History of Science]] (previously a corresponding member since 1988). He is, since 1986, a member of the Danish National Committee for the History and Philosophy of Science and is, since 1990, the Danish representative in the International Commission on the History of Mathematics. He was elected in 1996 a member of the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] and in 2012 a Fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]]. He is a member of the USA-based [[History of Science Society]] and a member of the [[Danish Mathematical Society]]. He is also a member of the Danish Society for the History of Science, whose president he was from 1995 to 2006 and whose secretary he has been since 2007.

He is married since 1990 and has three daughters.

'''Joy Hakim''' (born January 16, 1931) is an American author who has written a ten-volume history of the United States, ''[[A History of US]]'', and ''Freedom: A History of US'' (a trade book to accompany a 16-part PBS series), all published by [[Oxford University Press]]. Hakim is also the author of ''The Story of Science,'' three volumes co-published by [[Smithsonian Books]] and the [[National Science Teachers Association]].

== Background ==
Hakim is a graduate of Rutland High School [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]]. She has earned a Bachelor's Degree from [[Smith College]] and a Master's Degree and honorary doctorate from [[Goucher College]].&lt;ref name="Joy Hakim Site - Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home - joy hakim|url=http://www.joyhakim.com/|website=www.joyhakim.com|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a schoolteacher in Syracuse, New York, Omaha, Nebraska, and Virginia Beach, Virginia. Hakim was also an assistant editor of McGraw-Hill's World News in New York City, a reporter for the Ledger-Star in Norfolk, VA and a business writer for the Virginian-Pilot, also located in Norfolk. In 1978,  she became the first woman to be an associate editor and editorial writer for the Virginian-Pilot.

== Published work ==

Hakim's first published work was the ten-volume ''A History of US,'' from Oxford University Press in 1993.  The book is written as a narrative history intended for young readers. ''The Story of Science'' is co-published by Smithsonian Books and NSTA, the National Science Teachers Association. The first volume, ''Aristotle Leads the Way'' was published in 2004; ''Newton at the Center'' was published in 2005; and ''Einstein Adds a New Dimension'' followed in 2007. ''A History of US'' was turned into a 16-part [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television series.&lt;ref name="A History of Us"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/historyofus/ |title=Freedom: A History of US. Home |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[K12 (company)|K12]] has made an abridged 4 volume Concise Edition of A History of US.&lt;ref name="A History of Us"/&gt; Teachers materials to accompany the books are available from the teacher/educator CSOS team at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;ref name=TeachingMaterials&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.jhu.edu/CSOS/tdmg/program/history.html |title=U.S. History |publisher=Web.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSTA has also made teaching materials available on their website.&lt;ref name=NSTA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsta.org/publications/press/extras/hakim3.aspx |title=Science Teaching Materials - NSTA Press Extras: Einstein Adds a New Dimension |publisher=Nsta.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hakim has had much of her work published as e-books.  The 10 volume e-book version of ''A History of US'', text-only e-books from Oxford, is now joined by the 3 volume e-book version of ''The Story of Science''. ''Aristotle Leads the Way'', ''Newton at the Center'', and ''Einstein Adds A New Dimension'' have recently been made available as illustrated e-books from the Smithsonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Books|first1=Smithsonian|title=Story of Science {{!}} Smithsonian Books Store|url=http://www.smithsonianbooks.com/story-science/|website=www.smithsonianbooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recently published ''Reading Science Stories'' is an e-book filled with stories of scientific adventurers (Joy Hakim, June 11, 2015). Some stories are adapted from ''The Story of Science'', some are new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading Science Stories|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25732845-reading-science-stories|website=Goodreads|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Free To Believe (or not)'' is an illustrated e-book that tells the story of religious freedom in America. (Joy Hakim; 1 edition, June 2, 2016).&lt;ref name="Joy Hakim Site - Press Release"/&gt;

== Recognition ==
Hakim's books earned her the first James A. Michener Award for Writing by the National Council for Social Studies and two Parents' Choice awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education World: Award-Winning History Series Takes Students by Storm! (An ex...|url=http://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/curr235.shtml|website=www.educationworld.com|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=curr235&gt;[http://www.education-world.com/a_curr/curr235.shtml Award-Winning History Series Takes Students by Storm!] Education World e-Interview with author Joy Hakim&lt;/ref&gt;

Now in a revised third and fourth editions, incorporating new materials and corrections, books from ''A History of US'' have been recommended to accompany the Common Core curriculum. The books are also used in some [[home schooling|home school]] curricula.&lt;ref name="K12 Website"&gt;[http://www.k12.com/curriculum_and_products/history_main/american_history_before_1865/ American History Before 1865] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725093239/http://www.k12.com/curriculum_and_products/history_main/american_history_before_1865/ |date=2008-07-25 }} - K12 curriculum&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Pulitzer-prize winning historian David McCullough went before the Senate Education Committee in support of a bill sponsored by Lamar Alexander and Ted Kennedy intended to improve the teaching and learning of history. McCullough gave a scathing attack on the state of textbooks, but cited Hakim's book as an exception: "Joy Hakim's new...multi-volume History of the United States is superb. But others are dismal almost beyond describing.".&lt;ref name="109 Senate Hearings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_senate_hearings&amp;docid=22-340 |title=FDsys - Browse CHRG |publisher=Frwebgate.access.gpo.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Hakim's treatment of pre-modern Western history and the New World colonial period in ''History of Us: Making Thirteen Colonies'' has been criticized by the president of the Textbook League, William J. Bennetta. In particular, the concept of multiculturalism, including an asserted Chinese influence on European culture in ''The First Americans'', has been criticized by Bennetta for its lack of support by archaeological or historical records. Some older middle school aged students could find the books graded towards a lower level, and therefore frustrating.&lt;ref name=111joy&gt;[http://www.textbookleague.org/111joy.htm 'Multi-Culti Joy', by William J. Bennetta] - criticism of ''A History of US''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=113hak&gt;[http://www.textbookleague.org/113hak.htm 'More Hokum from Hakim' by William J.Bennetta] - criticism of ''A History of US''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Graf studied [[philology]] at the [[University of Basel]]; [[English studies|English]], [[Romance studies|Romance]] and [[Scandinavian studies]], and in 1979 completed his [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]].&lt;ref name="HDIM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://holocausthandbooks.com/index.php?author_id=3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inconvenienthistory.com/columnists/jurgen-graf.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630195524/http://inconvenienthistory.com/columnists/jurgen-graf.php |archivedate=2013-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Graf spent several years working as a [[school teacher]] teaching languages and later taught German at a [[Taipei]] school in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="HDIM" /&gt; On his return to Basel, he worked as interrogator of [[Refugee|asylum seekers]] at the receiving agency on the repurposed [[Rhine]] cruise ship ''Basilea''. He described his experiences in his 1990 book ''The Ship of Fools'' (''Das Narrenschiff''), over which he was accused of [[xenophobia]]. 

By the early 1990s, Graf was a convert to [[Holocaust denial]], and was introduced to the field by his friend and retired school teacher Arthur Vogt through the works of [[Serge Thion]], [[Arthur Butz]] and [[Wilhelm Stäglich]].&lt;ref name="HDIM" /&gt; During the 1990s Graf published several controversial works on the subject of [[the Holocaust]], his first titled ''The Holocaust on trial: Eyewitness accounts versus natural laws'' (''Der Holocaust auf dem Prüfstand: Augenzeugenberichte versus Naturgesetze''),&lt;ref name="HDIM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JGHADP"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Der Holocaust auf dem Prüfstand: Augenzeugenberichte versus Naturgesetze|trans-title=The Holocaust on trial: Eyewitness accounts versus natural laws|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Der_Holocaust_auf_dem_Pr%C3%BCfstand.html?id=DQFWAAAAYAAJ|volume=|first=Jürgen|last=Graf|publisher=Guideon Burg Verlag|location=Burg|year=1993|language=German|pages=|isbn=9783952038208}}&lt;/ref&gt; several of his later books co-authored with the Italian Holocaust denier [[Carlo Mattogno]].&lt;ref name="HDIM" /&gt; Graf distributed his book to journalists and parliamentarians, establishing a reputation as a Holocaust denier. As the result, he was dismissed from his teaching position; he was later employed in a private school in Basel, teaching German to foreign students.&lt;ref name="HDIM" /&gt; 

Graf's publications eventually led Swiss authorities to prosecute him for violating Swiss anti-racism laws.&lt;ref name="HDIM" /&gt; Graf and his then publisher, Gerhard Förster, were tried by a Swiss court in July 1998; Graf was sentenced to a substantial fine and 15-months imprisonment.&lt;ref name="HDIM" /&gt; He fled the country while awaiting his appeal, traveling through Poland, Russia, Ukraine and Turkey, ending in [[Iran]], where a group of Iranian Holocaust deniers sheltered him in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name="HDIM" /&gt; Graf subsequently relocated to Moscow, Russia, where he met and married a [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] woman in 2001.&lt;ref name="HDIM" /&gt; He currently lives and works in Moscow as a translator&lt;ref name="HDIM" /&gt;,despite rehabilitation of nazism is a felony under paragraph 354.1 of Russian Penal Code.

'''Mikael "Mickey" Adolphson''' (born March 10, 1961) is a Swedish historian of medieval Japan. Adolphson is the Keidanren Professor of Japanese Studies at the [[University of Cambridge]]'s Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies and a [[Fellow]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].

== Early life ==
Brought up in [[Kalmar]], [[Sweden]], Adolphson was from a young age inspired to become a historian, influenced by the medieval [[Kalmar Castle]] and the many Iron Age and Viking remains on the island of [[Öland]] &lt;ref name="FAMES site"&gt;Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies Site, [http://www.ames.cam.ac.uk/directory/adolphsonmickey]; retrieved 2016-9-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
After graduating from high school in Kalmar the late 1970s, he graduated with a B.A. in History, Museum and Cultural Studies in 1985 from [[Lund University]]. A premodernist, he was inspired by the similarities between medieval Europe and Japan to focus his attention on pre-1600 Japan. He spent two years studying Japanese at [[Stockholm University]] before receiving a scholarship from the Japanese Education Ministry in 1986. 

During the next two and a half years he lived in Kyoto and Osaka while studying at [[Kyoto University]] under the guidance of Professor Oyama Kyohei. During that time, he also coached volleyball at Osaka University of Foreign Studies and later at Kyoto University. Upon returning to Sweden, he became the head coach of the KFUM Göteborg women’s team, which took fifth place in the Elite League, in addition to winning several tournaments. 

In 1989, he entered [[Stanford University]]'s Ph.D. program with Professor [[Jeffrey Mass]] as his mentor. Returning to Kyoto University in the spring of 1992 for dissertation research, he also worked for the Japan Volleyball Association as an interpreter. He resumed at Stanford in the fall of 1993 and finished his dissertation two years later.&lt;ref name="FAMES site" /&gt;

== Career ==
Adolphson’s first academic appointment was at the [[University of Oklahoma]] from 1995 to 1999, and then [[Harvard University]], where he was assistant and associate professor of Japanese History. In 2008 he joined the faculty at the [[University of Alberta]] as Professor of Japanese Cultural Studies, and served as chair of the Department of East Asian Studies and associate dean in the Faculty of Arts.&lt;ref name="FAMES site"/&gt; As associate dean, he founded the first pedagogical research unit for Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, named the [https://www.ualberta.ca/arts/research/arts-pedagogy-research-and-innovation-laboratory/project-based-learning/pbl-in-a-japanese-history-class Arts Pedagogy Research and Innovation Laboratory], where one of his project-based courses is featured. Adolphson has been [[Keidanren Professor of Japanese Studies]] at Cambridge since January 2016; the post was held previously by [[Richard Bowring]] and [[Peter Kornicki]]. During his [https://japanandtheworld.org/adolphson-inaugural/ inaugural lecture] at Cambridge in October 2016, Adolphson announced the launching of a new vision for Japanese Studies at Cambridge, entitled [http://www.japanandtheworld.org Japan and the World].

'''Mubarak Ali''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''مُبارَک علی '''}}}}), is a [[Pakistani]] [[historian]], activist and [[scholar]].&lt;ref name=pakteahouse&gt;http://pakteahouse.net/2008/08/30/history-is-different-from-farce-dr-mubarak/, Profile of Mubarak Ali on pakteahouse.net website, Published 30 Aug 2008, Retrieved 25 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt; His main theme, in most of his books, has been that some history books written in Pakistan had been 'dictated' by the ruling class (the so-called 'Establishmint in Pakistan') and, in his view, those history books represent 'perversion of facts'.&lt;ref name=pakteahouse/&gt;

==Early life and career==
Ali was born in [[Tonk, India|Tonk]], [[a pathan state]], [[British India]] on April 21, 1941.
Ali received a [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in history from [[Sindh University]], Jamshoro in 1963. In 1972, he went to London, then Germany to pursue higher studies and in 1976, he attained a PhD degree (on the Mughal Period of India) at [[Ruhr University Bochum|Ruhr University]], [[Bochum]], Germany.&lt;ref name=oocities/&gt; He later became head of the History Department at the [[University of Sindh]]. He was the Director of the [[Goethe-Institut|Goethe Institute]] in [[Lahore]] until 1996.&lt;ref name=oocities/&gt; In 2005, he is the editor of the quarterly journal ''Taarikh'' ("History") and has been widely interviewed by electronic and print media in [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/1067999, Mubarak Ali listed as the editor of the quarterly journal ''Taarikh'' (History) in 2005 on Dawn newspaper, Published 25 June 2005, Retrieved 26 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, while speaking at a seminar in [[Mumbai]] organised by the NGO Khoj, Ali referred to fundamentalism's effects on historical scholarship in his country. He described how after the 1965 war with India, ancient history was de-emphasized in Pakistan by some historians.&lt;ref name=pakteahouse/&gt; The official government rule stated that anything outside of the syllabus "is not part of our history".  He further stated that the official historiography in Pakistan is committed to the [[two-nation theory]] in the Indian subcontinent. In other words, Hindus and Muslims in pre-1947 era [[British India]] essentially were 2 different and distinct nations and, therefore, the British needed to divide old India into 2 different countries, based on this fact, before they ended their colonial rule in British India. This was called the [[Pakistan Movement]] and it succeeded in its effort with the support of the majority of the Indian Muslims under the leadership of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and an independent Pakistan was created in 1947. Although later, after independence of Pakistan in 1947, many history book writers ignored the Pakistan public's need for the truth and keeping a balanced view of history when writing their history books. Instead, some historians went to the other extreme and started to confuse the Pakistani public about whether Pakistan's known history begins from the 5000 years old [[Indus Valley Civilization]] or from the Arab Muslims [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] (31 Dec 695-18 July 715)] and  his attack on [[Sindh]] in 712 A.D. or from the [[Independence of Pakistan]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=pakteahouse/&gt;

Speaking at the "National Seminar on Rani Kot", a historic location and fort in [[Sindh]], he called for the reading and writing of history from a different angle, in which invaders of old and ancient India should not be always acclaimed as "great".  He said that archaeological sites do have their own significance, referring to the discovery of [[Mohenjo-daro]] which reflected a great civilization of the region. This discovery played a dominant role in the independence movement of the subcontinent, because until its discovery, people of this part of the world were not considered literate or civilised.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/2006/12/01/nat37.htm Committee formed to explore history of Sindh, [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] newspaper, Published 1 December 2006, Retrieved 10 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

He has written a number of books and articles on Ind-Pakistani history, and has been widely acclaimed as an anti-establishment and anti-government thinker and historian. He stated in an interview that "No authentic history has yet been written about Pakistan and its independence. There is a lot of confusion among the so-called pro-Establishment historians and educationists. Whatever has been written so far is distortion of history and entirely unbalanced."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2008/07/09/nat11.htm History is different from farce: Dr Mubarak], [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] newspaper, Published 9 July 2008, Retrieved 10 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Mubarak Ali has called for the rewriting of the subcontinent's history and correction of what he called "historical aberrations", so that the hatred and misunderstanding prevailing between the people of India and Pakistan could come to an end. He said textbooks in the two countries had been systematically distorted and that the time has come to reverse the trend.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/news/1070509/dawn-opinion-september-26-2007#3, [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] newspaper, Opinion: 26 September 2007, Retrieved 10 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali has said that "any system based on oppression, coercion and authoritarianism [is] the first problem in the way of writing history". Pakistan's history has been dictated, he said, by politics and the personal ideologies of autocratic rulers and military dictators. He also reiterated his call for "history to be analyzed and rewritten from the perspective of the masses instead of the viewpoint of rulers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2008/07/10/ed.htm#2 A distorted history], [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] newspaper, Published 10 July 2008, Retrieved 10 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Mubarak Ali claimed that the police was harassing him and investigating him to "verify his learning", and that he was considering leaving Pakistan forever. Four police [[First Information Report]]s were lodged against him in Lahore.

In 2007, Mubarak Ali published three books: ''Qadeem Hindustan'' ("Ancient India"), ''Ahd-e-Wusta Ka Hindustan'' ("India of the Middle Ages") and ''Bartanvi Hindustan'' ("British India"), published jointly by the NGO [[ActionAid]] and the Fiction House. These books were targeted towards younger readers. Speaking at the launch, Ali stated that some of the Pakistani curricula did not contain any citation about [[Ashoka the Great]], whose reign witnessed peace and religious harmony. According to Ali, "it was the British who destroyed the harmony and sowed the seeds of hatred among Hindus and Muslims as the Mughals' policy of religious harmony continued to be applied during their ruling period (1526-1857) despite all sorts of hiccups".&lt;ref name=Dawn1&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2007/05/29/local13.htm Unbiased record of history must for enlightenment: Dr Mubarak Ali’s books launched], [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] newspaper, Published 29 May 2007, Retrieved 10 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mubarak Ali, the textbook reform in Pakistan began with the introduction of [[Pakistan Studies]] and Islamic studies by [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] in 1971, which became a compulsory subject in the national curriculum. In the 1980s, former military dictator [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], as part of a general drive towards Islamization, started the process of historical revisionism and exploited this initiative. "The Pakistani establishment taught their children right from the beginning that this state was built on the basis of religion – that's why they do not have tolerance for other religions and want to wipe out all of them."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/may/18/pakistan-textbooks-religious-extremism The threat of Pakistan's revisionist texts], [[The Guardian]], Published 18 May 2009, Retrieved 25 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at the [[Human Rights Commission of Pakistan]] office in May 2009, Mubarak Ali said, "democracy in Pakistan had an imprint of martial laws and what we were witnessing today could at best be described as 'feudal democracy'. It is the third generation of feudals who are ruling Pakistan". Although [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]] (MMA) lost the elections, Ali argued that religiosity had grown in Pakistan to such an extent that "every political party in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] is an MMA and it is the assembly that approved [[Nizam-e-Adl Regulation 2009|Nizam-e-Adl regulation]]."

His 2009 comprehensive book in [[Urdu]], ''Taareekh Ki Daryafat'', is considered to be his most concise work. The first part of the book deals with heroism and society, historiography in the 20th century, how we should write history and his autobiography, while the second part covers a large number of topics. These interpretations highlight national controversies, for example about Mughal Muslims in India, the relationship between the Ottomans and the Mughals, religion and its political use, Islamic scholars and modernism, French revolution, Indus Civilization, imperialism and fundamentalism, history of coil and coffee, honor killings in Pakistan, forgetful men and the latest trends in [[historiography]].&lt;ref name=paktalibanisation/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9287">[[Image:Evreinov by Repin.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Portrait of Evreinov by [[Ilya Repin]] (1915)]]
'''Nikolai Nikolayevich Evreinov''' ({{lang-ru|Николай Николаевич Евреинов}}; February 13, 1879 - September 7, 1953) was a [[Russians|Russian]] [[theatre director|director]], [[dramatist]] and [[theatre practitioner]] associated with [[Russian Symbolism]].

== Life ==
The son of a French woman and a Russian engineer, Evreinov developed a keen interest in theatre from an early age, penning his first play at the age of 7. Six years later, he performed in a wandering circus as a [[clown]]. He attended a [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Pskov]], before moving to the [[School of Jurisprudence]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. It was there that he staged his first full-fledged play, ''The Rehearsal'', followed by an [[opéra bouffe]], ''The Power of Charms'' (1899).

Having matriculated from the school in 1901, Evreinov turned his attention to music and studied with [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] at the [[Moscow Conservatory]] for a couple of years. In 1907-08 and 1911-12 he was involved in reconstructing the world of medieval plays and those dating from the [[Spanish Golden Age]] at the [[Starinny Theatre]] ("Old-Fashioned Theatre") in Saint Petersburg.

The foremost Russian actress, [[Vera Komissarzhevskaya]], asked him to cast her in the leading role for his version of ''[[Francesca da Rimini]]'' (1908). Later that year, Evreinov's production of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Salomé (play)|Salomé]]'' was suppressed on the orders of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. Evreinov's association with the Komissarzhevsky family continued for several years. Together with [[Theodore Komisarjevsky]], he staged a number of "harlequinades" and "monodramas" as part of his new project, "The Merry Theatre for Aged Children". His concept of ''monodrama'' was exemplified in ''The Theater of the Soul'', a 1915 production set inside the human breast as the repository of the soul.

In 1910, Evreinov quit his job at the Ministry of Railways to take the helm as producer, dramatist, and composer of the False Mirror Theatre in Saint Petersburg. It was there that he staged more than one hundred plays, including fourteen pieces written by himself. His production of ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' was a milestone in the history of Russian theatre: each act was staged so as to parody one of the following aesthetics: provincial realist theatres, the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] of [[Constantin Stanislavski]], the techniques of [[Edward Gordon Craig]] and [[Max Reinhardt]], and slapstick comedy films.

In 1922 and 1923 Evreinov visited [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]] where his plays were produced by the likes of [[Jacques Copeau]] and [[Charles Dullin]]. He spent the rest of his life in Paris, working with the {{illm|Opéra Russe|Opéra russe à Paris|fr}}, [[Sorbonne]], and [[Serge Lifar]]. He prepared a comprehensive monograph tracing the ''History of Russian Theatre'' through the centuries. Many of his later plays have never been staged, including the "anti-[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]ist drama" ''The Steps of Nemesis'', with such characters as [[Alexei Rykov]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Genrikh Yagoda]], and [[Nikolai Yezhov]].

== ''The Storming of the Winter Palace'' ==
[[File:Stormningen av vinterpalatset.jpg|thumb|Scene from the 1920 spectacle that was later used as a purportedly "authentic" photograph of the events.]]

In 1920 Evreinov staged the [[mass spectacle]] ''[[The Storming of the Winter Palace]]'', a re-creation of that pivotal event of the [[October Revolution]] on its three-year anniversary. The mass spectacle form took the pre-revolutionary Symbolist utopias of "ritual theatre" (whose formulation was largely a response to the abortive [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905 revolution]]), and recast their 'people' as the [[proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleberg (1980, 44-64).&lt;/ref&gt; Performed on the 7th of November before one hundred thousand spectators, the action begins with the [[February Revolution]], follows the gradual organization of the workers (on a [[Red Army|red stage]] to the left, with [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] and the [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]] on a [[White movement|white stage]] to the right), until they are illuminated fully by searchlights, and crying "[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], Lenin" charge over the arch which joins the two stages to do battle with the "Whites." Kerensky leaps to a car for an escape, and is pursued along a path between the two large groups of spectators by trucks full of the Red Guard waving bayonets, to the Palace. Silhouettes struggle in the windows of the Palace, until the Red Army is finally successful, and red lights flash out. A cannon fired from the battleship ''[[Russian cruiser Aurora|Aurora]]'' and fireworks herald the victory of the October Revolution. Also later possibly inspired by the fireworks, and cannon fire, the color orange somehow became one of the official colors of October.

== Works and theories ==
[[Image:Nikolai Evreinov Pro Scena Sua titlepage.jpg|thumb|Title page from Evreinov's ''Pro Scena Sua'' (1915), showing a [[commedia dell'arte|commedia]] [[Harlequin]]]]

Evreinov argued that the role of theatre was to ape and mimick nature. In his estimation, theatre is everything around us. He pointed out that nature is full of theatrical conventions: desert flowers mimicking the stones; mouse feigning death in order to escape a cat's claws; complicated dances of birds, etc. He viewed theatre as a universal symbol of existence.

''Apology for Theatricality'' is his most famous essay. It was published in 1908. Here Evreinov promoted an underlying [[aesthetic]]:
:"To make a theatre of life is the duty of every artist. ... the stage must not borrow so much from life as life borrows from the stage."

The director sought to reinvigorate the theatre (and through it life itself) through the rediscovery of the origin of theatre in [[play (activity)|play]]. He was influenced by the philosophies of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] and [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]], and, like [[Vsevolod Meyerhold|Meyerhold]], the [[aesthetics]] of [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] and the [[commedia dell'arte]] (particularly in its use of [[mask]] and [[wikt:spontaneity|spontaneity]]). Evreinov developed his theatrical theories in ''An Introduction to Monodrama'' (1909), ''The Theatre as Such'' (1912), ''The Theatre for Oneself'', and ''Pro Scena Sua'' (1915).&lt;ref name="gobub"&gt;Golub (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

His plays include the [[monodrama]]s ''The Presentation of Love'' (1910) and ''In the Stage-Wings of the Soul'' (1911), the [[Tragedy|tragi]]-[[farce]] '' A Merry Death'' (1908, based on [[Alexander Blok]]'s ''The Puppet Show''), and ''The Chief Thing'' (1921); the last two of which were heavily indebted to the ''commedia''. Based on [[Maxim Gorky]]'s ''[[The Lower Depths]]'' (1902), ''The Chief Thing'' provided Evreinov's one international success, was done on stage and screen in France as ''La Comedie du Bonheur'' and was staged on Broadway in 1926 by Theater Guild with Harold Clurman and Edward G. Robinson. His ''Ship of the Righteous '' was a great success in Poland.  According to Spencer Golub, ''The Chief Thing'' play provides a "compendium of Evreinovian aesthetics and devices" and features [[Harlequin]] "as death-defier and life-transformer".&lt;ref name="gobub"/&gt;

After having had several positions, Fure became professor in modern history at the [[University of Bergen]] from 1998 to 2002. He was then appointed as director of research at the [[Norwegian Center for Studies of Holocaust and Religious Minorities]]. From 2002 to 2004 Fure was editor of ''[[Historisk Tidsskrift (Oslo)|Historisk Tidsskrift]]'', a Norwegian journal for scientific historical research.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} He is a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26848/artikkel/vis.html?tid=27637|title=Gruppe 1: Historie|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fure is a specialist in research on genocide, as well as modern German and European history. In 1997 Fure engaged in the Norwegian debate on [[David Irving]] against [[Hans Fredrik Dahl]]. Dahl would later recall his recommendation of Irving's works, but only after Irving lost [[Irving v. Penguin Books and Lipstadt|his lawsuit]] against [[Deborah Lipstadt]].

'''Reginald Laubin''' (December 4, 1903 – April 5, 2000) was an American writer, dancer and expert on Native American culture and customs.

==Biography==
Performed dances of the American Plains Indians during the 1930s, 40's and 50's. Married to [[Gladys Laubin]]. The two lived in and extensively wrote about [[tipis]] and other structures and buildings used by Native Americans.

Mr. Laubin and his wife, Gladys, with whom he performed, were not Native American, but they studied Native American dance and culture with Sioux, Crow, Cheyenne and other Plains Indians. Reginald and Gladys were adopted by the Sioux tribe and were respectively given the names of Tatanka Wanjila (One Bull) and Wiyaka Wastewin (Good Feather Woman). The two later lived with the Crow tribe in the state of Montana.

The Laubins performed and gave lecture demonstrations throughout the United States and around the world in front of all manner of audiences.

===Death and afterward===
Laubin died on Wednesday, April 5, 2000 at a hospital in [[Urbana, Illinois]].

The [[Spurlock Museum]], opened in 2002, named its Laubin Gallery of American Indian Cultures in the couple's honor.

The '''Rufus Sita Tombstone''' (RIB 121) is the marker of the grave of ''Rufus Sita'', a [[Roman Britain|Roman]] soldier from the mid 1st Century AD, found near London Road, [[Gloucester]], in 1824. The stone is approximately 4ft by 3ft in size.&lt;ref name=post&gt;"ROMAN ANTIQUITIES" in ''The Morning Post'', 17 April 1824, Issue 16638.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tombstone is of a type typically used for Roman soldiers, depicting a horseman spearing a foe on the ground with an epitaph below stating the age and service of the deceased, his origins and who placed the tombstone.&lt;ref name=ward&gt;Ward, John. ''The Roman Era in Britain''. London: Methuen, 1911, pp. 150-152. [https://archive.org/details/romanerainbritai00warduoft Free download here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the tombstone, Rufus Sita was a horseman of the Sixth [[Cohort (military unit)|Cohort]] of [[Thracians]], who died aged 40 after 22 years service. His heirs arranged to have the tombstone made in accordance with the wishes in his [[Will (law)|Will]]. The Sixth Cohort was one of the Roman military units stationed at Gloucester, or [[Glevum]] as it was then known.

The Latin inscription on the tombstone reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
RVFVS · SITA · EQVES · CHO · VI&lt;br /&gt;
TRACVM · ANN · XL · STIP · XXII&lt;br /&gt;
HEREDES · EXS · TEST · F · CVRAVE&lt;br /&gt;
H. S. E. &lt;ref name=ward/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
or:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Rufus Sita, eques Cohortis VI''&lt;br /&gt;
''Thracum, annorum XL, stipendiorum XXII.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Heredes ex testamento faciendum curaverunt.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Hic situs est.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Which translates as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Rufus Sita, horseman of the Sixth Cohort of Thracians,''&lt;br /&gt;
''lived forty years and served twenty-two.''&lt;br /&gt;
''His heirs, in accordance to his will, had this erected.''&lt;br /&gt;
''He is laid here.'' &lt;ref name=ward/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The tombstone has been in the [[Gloucester City Museum &amp; Art Gallery]] since 1873.

==Biography==
[[File:Satya Mohan Joshi by Mahalaxmi silwal.JPG|thumb|Satya Mohan Joshi at programme]]
Satyamohan was born in 1920 to Shankar Raj and Rajkumari Joshi, in [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur district]] of Nepal.&lt;ref name=ecs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecs.com.np/features/interview-satya-mohan-joshi |title=Interview: Satya Mohan Joshi |publisher=Ecs.com.np |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having learnt his alphabets at home, he later enrolled at [[Durbar High School]] in [[Kathmandu]].

'''Slave breeding in the United States''' includes any practice of [[Slavery in the United States|slave ownership]] that aimed to systematically influence the reproduction of slaves in order to increase the wealth of slaveholders.&lt;ref name=Marable&gt;Marable, Manning (2000). ''How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America: Problems in Race, Political Economy, and Society''. Boston: South End Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zXoOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72 p. 72.]&lt;/ref&gt; Slave breeding included coerced sexual relations between male and female slaves, [[forced pregnancy|promoting pregnancies of slaves]], and favoring female slaves who could produce a relatively large number of children.&lt;ref name=Marable /&gt; The purpose of slave breeding was to acquire new slaves without incurring the cost of purchase, and to fill labor shortages caused by the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|termination of the Atlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref name="Davis2014"&gt;Davis, David Brion (2014) [https://books.google.com/books?id=L7eVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14 "Slavery, Sex, and Dehumanization."] In Gwyn Campbell and Elizabeth Elbourne's ''Sex, Power, and Slavery''. Athens, OH: Ohio University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=L7eVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17 pp. 51-53.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Selective breeding]] between slaves with the aim of developing particular [[Phenotypic trait|physical traits]] was uncommon however,&lt;ref&gt;Nolen, Claude H. (2001) ''African American Southerners in Slavery, Civil War, and Reconstruction''. Jefferson, NC: McFarland Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NDdxXkylAHgC&amp;pg=PA46 p. 46.]&lt;/ref&gt; as most slaves were unrestricted in their choice of sexual partners.&lt;ref&gt;Sailes, G. A. (1998) ''African Americans in Sports: Contemporary Themes''. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SAa_GairhY8C&amp;pg=PA192 192.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==
=== End of the American slave trade ===
{{See also|Field slaves|House slaves}}
[[File:SlaveDanceand Music.jpg|thumb|340px|''Slaves dancing on a South Carolina plantation.'' ''[[The Old Plantation]]'', c. 1790.]]
The laws that ultimately ended the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]] came about as a result of the efforts of [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] Christian groups such as the [[Society of Friends]], known as Quakers, and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] led by [[William Wilberforce]], whose efforts through the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] led to the passage of the [[Slave Trade Act]] by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, Paul and [[Joseph C. Miller]], eds. (1998) ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of World Slavery'', Vol. 2. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to increased calls for the same ban in America, supported by members of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] from both the North and the South as well as President [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Dorothy and Carl J. Schneider (2000). ''Slavery in America from Colonial Times to the Civil War''. New York: Facts on File, pp. 261-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time that the importation of slaves from Africa was being restricted or eliminated, the United States was undergoing a rapid expansion of [[cotton]], [[sugar cane]] and [[rice]] production in the [[Deep South]] and the West. Invention of the cotton gin enabled the profitable cultivation of short-staple cotton, which could be produced more widely than other types; this led to [[King Cotton]] throughout the Deep South. Slaves were treated as a [[commodity]] by owners and traders alike, and were regarded as the crucial labor for the production of lucrative cash crops that fed the triangle trade.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Berlin, ''Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America'', Cambridge, MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1998, pp. 95-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David W. Galenson, ''Traders, Planters, and Slaves: Market Behavior in Early English America'', 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The slaves were managed as assets in the same way as [[Chattel slavery|chattel]]; slaveholders passed laws regulating slavery and the slave trade designed to protect their financial interests; there was little protection for the slaves.  On large plantations, slave families were separated for different types of labor. Men tended to be assigned to large field gangs. Workers were assigned to the task for which they were best physically suited according to the overseer.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Schneider and Carl J. Schneider, "Slavery in America from Colonial Times to the Civil War", ''Facts on File'', 2000. pp. 52-56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ira Berlin, ''Many Thousands Gone'', 1998, pp. 40-41; 129-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breeding in response to end of slave imports ===
The prohibition of the [[African slave trade#Atlantic Ocean trade|African slave trade]] after 1807 limited the supply of slaves in the United States.  Slaveholders looked at the fertility of slave women as part of their productivity, and intermittently forced the women to have large numbers of children. The invention of the [[cotton gin]] enabled expanded cultivation in the uplands of short-staple cotton, leading to clearing lands cultivating cotton through large areas of the Deep South, especially the [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]]. The demand for labor in the area increased sharply and an internal slave market expanded. At the same time, the Upper South had an excess supply of slaves because of a shift to mixed-crops agriculture, which was less labor-intensive than tobacco. During this time period, the terms "breeding slaves", "child bearing women", "breeding period", and "too old to breed" became familiar.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Julia Floyd (1991) ''Slavery and Rice Culture in Low Country Georgia, 1750-1860'' University of Tennessee Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bZzDDt3RPkoC&amp;pg=PA104p. 104.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Planters in the [[Upland South|Upper South]] states started selling slaves to the [[Deep South]], generally through slave traders such as [[Franklin and Armfield Office|Franklin and Armfield]]. [[Louisville, Kentucky]], on the [[Ohio River]] was a major slave market and port for shipping slaves downriver by the Mississippi to the South. [[New Orleans]] had the largest slave market in the country and became the fourth largest city in the US by 1840 and the wealthiest, mostly because of its slave trade and associated businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Hornsby, Alton Jr. (2011) ''Black America: A State-by-State Historical Encyclopedia''. Santa Barbara CA: Greenwood Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fB3rQefP8wQC&amp;pg=PA335 p. 335.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slave accounts==
{{See also|Slave narrative}}
In the [[History of the United States (1789–1849)|antebellum]] years, numerous escaped slaves  wrote about their experiences in books called [[slave narratives]]. Many recounted that at least a portion of slave owners continuously interfered in the sexual lives of their slaves (usually the women). The slave narratives also testified that slave women were subjected to arranged marriages, forced matings, sexual violation by masters, their sons or overseers, and other forms of abuse. Skeptics maintain that reports from witnesses were [[apocrypha]]l, and never specified a particular place in which breeding practices were alleged to have occurred.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The historian [[E. Franklin Frazier]], in his book ''The Negro Family'', stated that "there were masters who, without any regard for the preferences of their slaves, mated their human chattel as they did their stock." Ex-slave Maggie Stenhouse remarked, "Durin' slavery there were stockmen. They was weighed and tested. A man would rent the stockman and put him in a room with some young women he wanted to raise children from."&lt;ref&gt;Work Projects Administration, ''Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews with Former Slaves, Arkansas Narratives, Part 6'', Kessinger Publishing, 2004, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamics ==
===Personhood to thinghood===
Several factors coalesced to make the [[Animal husbandry|breeding]] of slaves a common practice by the end of the 18th century, chief among them the enactment of laws and practices that transformed the view of slaves from "personhood" into "thinghood." In this way, slaves could be bought and sold as [[Chattel slavery|chattel]] without presenting a challenge to the [[Religion|religious beliefs]] and [[Mores|social mores]] of the society at large. All rights were to the owner of the slave, with the slave having no rights of self-determination either to his or her own person, spouse, or children.

Slaveholders began to think that slavery was grounded in the [[Bible]]. This view was inspired in part by a reinterpretation of the [[Curse of Ham|Genesis passage]] "Cursed be Canaan; The lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers" (Genesis 9); [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham, son of Noah]] and father of Canaan, was deemed the [[antediluvian]] progenitor of the African people. Some whites used the [[The Bible and slavery|Bible]] to justify the economic use of slave labor. The subjugation of slaves was taken as a natural right of the white slave owners. The second class position of the slave was not limited to his relationship with the slave master but was to be in relation to all whites. Slaves were considered subject to white persons.&lt;ref name="Donoghue"&gt;Eddie Donoghue, ''Black Breeding Machines: The Breeding of Negro Slaves in the Diaspora'', AuthorHouse, 2008, pp. 134-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
In a study of 2,588 slaves in 1860 by the [[economist]] Richard Sutch, he found that on slave-holdings with at least one woman, the average ratio of women to men exceeded 2:1. The imbalance was greater in the "selling states", where the excess of women over men was 300 per thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Sutch, Richard, "The Breeding of Slaves for Sale and the Westward of Slavery, 1850-1860", in Stanley L. Engerman and Eugene Genovese (eds), ''Race and Slavery in the Western Hemishpere: Q Studies'', Princeton University Press, 1975, pp. 173-210.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Another reason could be that more males were sold to the Deep South for field labor on the large plantations. --&gt;

===Natural increase ''vs'' systematic breeding===
[[Ned Sublette]], co-author of ''The American Slave Coast'', states that the reproductive worth of "breeding women" was essential to the young country's expansion not just for labor but as merchandise and [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] stemming from a shortage of [[silver standard|silver]], [[gold standard|gold]], or sound [[Banknote|paper tender]]. He concludes that slaves and their descendants were used as human savings accounts with newborns serving as [[interest rate|interest]] that functioned as the basis of money and [[credit (finance)|credit]] in a [[market (economics)|market]] premised on the continual expansion of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Sublette, Ned and Constance Sublette (2016). ''American Slave Coast: A History of the Slave-Breeding Industry''. Chicago IL: Chicago Review Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=iwCKCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT49 p. 49.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Fogel]] and [[Stanley Engerman]] reject the idea that ''systematic'' slave breeding was a major economic concern in their 1974 book ''[[Time on the Cross]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fogel, Robert; Engerman, Stanley (1995). ''Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery''. New York: Norton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ScpPBinpzwoC&amp;pg=PA78 p. 78.]&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that there is very meager evidence for the systematic breeding of slaves for sale in the market in the Upper South during the 19th century. They distinguish systematic breeding—the interference in normal sexual patterns by masters with an aim to increase fertility or encourage desirable characteristics—from [[Natalism|pro-natalist]] policies, the generalized encouragement of large families through a combination of rewards, improved living and working conditions for fertile women and their children, and other policy changes by masters. They point out that the demographic evidence is subject to a number of interpretations. Fogel argues that when planters intervened in the private lives of slaves it actually had a negative impact on population growth.&lt;ref name="Davis2014"/&gt;

'''Thomas Edward Lawrence''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|sep=,|CB|DSO}} (16 August 1888 – 19 May 1935) was a British [[archaeologist]], army officer, diplomat, and writer. He was renowned for his liaison role during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] and the [[Arab Revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[World War I|First World War]]. The breadth and variety of his activities and associations, and his ability to describe them vividly in writing, earned him international fame as '''Lawrence of Arabia'''—a title used for [[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|the 1962 film]] based on his wartime activities. 

He was born [[Legitimacy (family law)|out of wedlock]] in [[Tremadog]], Wales, in August 1888 to [[Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th Baronet|Thomas Chapman]] (who became, in 1914, Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th [[Chapman baronets|Baronet]]), an [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] nobleman from [[County Westmeath]], and Sarah Junner, a Scottish governess, whom Chapman had left his wife and first family in Ireland to cohabit with; they called themselves Mr and Mrs Lawrence. The name "Lawrence" was probably adopted from that of Sarah's likely father, member of a family of that name where her mother was employed as a servant when she became pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benson-Gyles |first1=Dick |title=The Boy in the Mask: The Hidden World of Lawrence of Arabia |date=2016 |publisher=The Lilliput Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 the family moved to [[Kirkcudbright]] in Scotland where his brother William George was born before moving to [[Dinard]] in France. In 1896, the Lawrences moved to [[Oxford]], where their son attended the [[City of Oxford High School for Boys|High School]] and then from 1907 to 1910 studied History at [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]]. Between 1910 and 1914 he worked as an archaeologist for the [[British Museum]], chiefly at [[Carchemish]], in [[Ottoman Syria]].

Soon after the outbreak of war he volunteered for the [[British Army]] and was stationed in Egypt. In 1916, he was sent to Arabia on an intelligence mission and quickly became involved with the Arab Revolt, providing, along with other British officers, liaison to the Arab forces. Working closely with [[Faisal I of Iraq|Emir Faisal]], a leader of the revolt, he participated in and sometimes led military activities against the Ottoman armed forces, culminating in the capture of Damascus in October 1918.

After the war, Lawrence joined the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]], working with both the British government and with Faisal. In 1922, he retreated from public life and spent the years until 1935 serving as an enlisted man, mostly in the Royal Air Force, with a brief stint in the Army. During this time, he wrote and published his best-known work, ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'', an autobiographical account of his participation in the Arab Revolt. He also translated books into English and wrote ''[[The Mint (book)|The Mint]]'', which was published posthumously and detailed his time in the [[Royal Air Force]] working as an ordinary aircraftman. He corresponded extensively and was friendly with well-known artists, writers, and politicians. For the Royal Air Force, he participated in the development of rescue motorboats.
&lt;!-- saving this for use elsewhere: In 1908, he joined the [[Oxford University]] [[Officers' Training Corps]] and underwent a two-year training course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/stratfordwritingservices/home/film-reviews/t-e-lawrence |title=A Biography of T. E. Lawrence |author=Stratford Writing Services |accessdate=15 November 2011 |quote=[[Officers' Training Corps]] is considered by many to have been equal to, if not better than, the rigorous standards of [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308170907/https://sites.google.com/site/stratfordwritingservices/home/film-reviews/t-e-lawrence |archivedate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  --&gt;

Lawrence's public image resulted in part from the sensationalised reporting of the Arab revolt by American journalist [[Lowell Thomas]], as well as from ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. In 1935, Lawrence was fatally injured in a motorcycle accident in Dorset.

==Early life==
[[File:Thomas Edward Lawrence birth-place Gorphwysfa.jpg|left|thumb|Lawrence's birthplace, Gorphwysfa, [[Tremadog]], Carnarvonshire, Wales]]

Thomas Edward Lawrence was born on 16 August 1888 in [[Tremadog]], Carnarvonshire (now Gwynedd),&lt;ref&gt;Aldington, 1955, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Wales in a house named Gorphwysfa, now known as Snowdon Lodge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=8x322-89x3MC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=T.+E.+Lawrence+%27Gorphwysfa%27#v=onepage&amp;q=T.%20E.%20Lawrence%20%27Gorphwysfa%27&amp;f=false |title=Little-Known Wars of Great and Lasting Impact |page=237|author=Alan Axelrod|publisher=Fair Winds, 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2011|isbn=9781616734619 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Np_H_j3hXUEC&amp;pg=PA280 |title=The Companion Guide to Wales |author=David Barnes|page=280|publisher=Companion Guides, 2005|accessdate=1 May 2011|isbn=9781900639439 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowdon Lodge|url=http://snowdonlodge.co.uk/|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Anglo-Irish father [[Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th Baronet|Thomas Chapman]] had left his wife Edith after he fell in love and had a son with Sarah Junner, a young Scotswoman who had been engaged as governess to his daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 1976, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah was the daughter of Elizabeth Junner and John Lawrence, who worked as a ship's carpenter and was a son of the household in which Elizabeth had been a servant. She was dismissed four months before Sarah was born. (Elizabeth identified Sarah's father as "John Junner – Shipwright journeyman".)&lt;ref&gt;Aldington, 1955, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lawrence arabia.gif|thumb|Lawrence memorial plaque at [[City of Oxford High School for Boys|Oxford Boys' High School]]]]

Sarah and Thomas did not marry, but lived together under the name Lawrence.  In 1914, Sir Thomas inherited the Chapman baronetcy based at [[Killua Castle]], the ancestral family home in County [[Westmeath]], Ireland; but he and Sarah continued to live in England.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, Appendix 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 1976, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; They had five sons; Thomas Edward was the second eldest. From Wales the family moved to [[Kirkcudbright]], [[Galloway]] in southwestern Scotland, then [[Dinard]] in Brittany, then to [[Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 1976, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894–96, the family lived at Langley Lodge (now demolished), set in private woods between the eastern borders of the New Forest and Southampton Water in Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The residence was isolated, and young "Ned" Lawrence had many opportunities for outdoor activities and waterfront visits.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian-Edwardian Britain was a very conservative society where the majority of people were God-fearing Christians with the corollary that premarital and extramarital sex were considered deeply shameful and those born illegitimate were born disgraced.&lt;ref name=JeremyWilson1911&gt;{{cite web  | last = Wilson | first = Jeremy | title = T.

In the summer of 1896, the Lawrences moved to 2, [[Polstead Road]] in [[Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1989, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; where they lived until 1921. Lawrence attended the [[City of Oxford High School for Boys]] from 1896 until 1907,&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 1976, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; where one of the four [[House system|houses]] was later named "Lawrence" in his honour; the school closed in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/resources/obs/boys_school_history.htm "Brief history of the City of Oxford High School for Boys, George Street", 'University of Oxford Faculty of History website''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418140326/http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/resources/obs/boys_school_history.htm |date=18 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence and one of his brothers became commissioned officers in the [[Church Lads' and Church Girls' Brigade|Church Lads' Brigade]] at [[St Aldate's Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Aldington, 1955, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence claimed that he ran away from home circa 1905 and served for a few weeks as a boy soldier with the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]] at [[St Mawes Castle]] in Cornwall, from which he was bought out. No evidence of this appears in army records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telawrence.info/telawrenceinfo/legacy3/analysis/asher022.htm |title=T. E.

==Antiquities and archaeology==

At the age of 15, Lawrence and his schoolfriend [[Cyril Beeson]] cycled around Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire, visited almost every village's parish church, studied their [[English church monuments|monuments]] and [[Antiquarian|antiquities]], and made [[Brass rubbing|rubbings]] of their [[monumental brass]]es.&lt;ref name=Beeson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beeson |first1=C.F.C. |authorlink1=Cyril Beeson |last2=Simcock |first2=A.V. |year=1989 |origyear=1962 |edition=3rd |title=Clockmaking in Oxfordshire 1400—1850 |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford|Museum of the History of Science]] |isbn=978-0-903364-06-5 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence and Beeson monitored building sites in Oxford and presented their finds to the [[Ashmolean Museum]].&lt;ref name=Beeson/&gt; The Ashmolean's ''Annual Report'' for 1906 said that the two teenage boys "by incessant watchfulness secured everything of antiquarian value which has been found."&lt;ref name=Beeson/&gt; In the summers of 1906 and 1907, Lawrence and Beeson toured France by bicycle, collecting photographs, drawings, and measurements of medieval castles.&lt;ref name=Beeson/&gt; In August 1907 Lawrence wrote home: "The Chaignons &amp; the Lamballe people, complimented me on my wonderful French: I have been asked twice since I arrived what part of France I came from".&lt;ref&gt;Larès, Maurice "T.E. Lawrence and France: Friends or Foes?" pages 220–242 from ''The T.E. Lawrence Puzzle'' edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1907 to 1910, Lawrence read History at [[Jesus College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1909, he set out alone on a three-month walking tour of [[List of Crusader castles|crusader castles]] in [[Ottoman Syria]], during which he travelled {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}} on foot.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989 pp. 57–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence graduated with [[First Class Honours]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; after submitting a thesis titled ''The Influence of the Crusades on European Military Architecture—to the End of the 12th Century'', based on his field research with Beeson in France,&lt;ref name=Beeson/&gt; notably in [[Châlus]], and his solo research in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QjpPbBvq9f4C&amp;pg=PA29 |title=The Medievalism of Lawrence of Arabia |last=Allen |first=Malcolm Dennis |page=29 |publisher=Penn State Press, 1991 |accessdate=1 May 2011|isbn=978-0271040608 |date=2010-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence was fascinated by the Middle Ages with his brother [[A. W. Lawrence|Arnold]] writing in 1937 that for him "medieval researches" were a "dream way of escape from bourgeois England".&lt;ref&gt;Allen, M.D. "Lawrence's Medievalism" pages 53–70 from ''The T.E.

In 1910 Lawrence was offered the opportunity to become a practising archaeologist in the Middle East, at [[Carchemish]], in the expedition that [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] was setting up on behalf of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Hogarth arranged a [[Demyship|"Senior Demyship"]], a form of scholarship, for Lawrence at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], to fund Lawrence's work at £100 a year.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1910, he sailed for [[Beirut]] and on his arrival went to Jbail ([[Byblos]]), where he studied [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to work on the excavations at Carchemish, near [[Jerablus]] in northern Syria, where he worked under Hogarth, [[Reginald Campbell Thompson|R. Campbell Thompson]] of the British Museum, and [[Leonard Woolley]], until 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 76–134.&lt;/ref&gt; He later stated that everything which he had accomplished he owed to Hogarth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telawrence.net/telawrencenet/letters/1927/271207_d_knowles.htm T. E. Lawrence letters, 1927&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211151322/http://telawrence.net/telawrencenet/letters/1927/271207_d_knowles.htm |date=11 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While excavating at Carchemish, Lawrence met [[Gertrude Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 Lawrence worked briefly with [[Flinders Petrie]] at [[Tarkhan (Egypt)|Kafr Ammar]] in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military intelligence==
In January 1914, Woolley and Lawrence were co-opted by the British military&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 136. Lawrence wrote to his parents "We are obviously only meant as red herrings to give an archaeological colour to a political job."&lt;/ref&gt; as an archaeological smokescreen for a British military survey of the [[Negev]] Desert. They were funded by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] to search for an area referred to in the Bible as the ''[[Zin Desert|Wilderness of Zin]]''. Along the way, they made an archaeological survey of the Negev Desert. The Negev was strategically important as, in the event of war, any [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army attacking Egypt would have to cross it. Woolley and Lawrence subsequently published a report of the expedition's archaeological findings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/Pages/WildZin.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018191000/http://www.pef.org.uk/Pages/WildZin.htm |archivedate=18 October 2006 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=18 October 2006 |accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a more important result was updated mapping of the area, with special attention to features of military relevance such as water sources. Lawrence also visited [[Aqaba]] and [[Petra]].

Following the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914, Lawrence did not immediately enlist in the British Army.  On the advice of [[S. F. Newcombe]], he held back until October, when he was commissioned on the [[General List]]. Before the end of the year he had been summoned by renowned archaeologist and historian Lt. Cmdr. [[David George Hogarth|David Hogarth]] to the nascent [[Arab Bureau]] intelligence unit in Cairo. Lawrence arrived in Cairo on 15 December 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau's chief was [[Gilbert Clayton|General Gilbert Clayton]] who reported to Egyptian High Commissioner [[Henry McMahon]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 152, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation during 1915 was complex.  Within the Arabic-speaking Ottoman territories, there was a growing Arab-nationalist movement, including many Arabs serving in the Ottoman armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; They were in contact with [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sharif Hussein]], [[Sharif of Mecca|Emir of Mecca]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; who was negotiating with the British, offering to lead an Arab uprising against the Ottomans.  In exchange, he wanted a British guarantee of an independent Arab state including the [[Hejaz]], Syria, and [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an uprising would have been very helpful to Britain in its war against the Ottomans, in particular greatly lessening the threat against the Suez Canal.

However, there was resistance from French diplomats, who insisted that Syria's future was as a French colony not an independent Arab state.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 169–170.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also strong objections from the Government of India which, although nominally part of the British government, acted independently.  Its vision was of Mesopotamia under British control serving as a granary for India; furthermore, it wanted to hold on to its Arabian outpost in Aden.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Arab Bureau, Lawrence supervised the preparation of maps,&lt;ref name="Wilson, 1989, p. 189"&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; produced a daily bulletin for the British generals operating in the theatre,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; and interviewed prisoners.&lt;ref name="Wilson, 1989, p. 189"/&gt; He was an advocate of a British landing at [[Alexandretta]], which never came to pass.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a consistent advocate of an independent Arab Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1915, the situation came to a crisis, as Sharif Hussein demanded an immediate commitment from Britain, with the threat that if this were denied, he would throw his weight behind the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 211–212.&lt;/ref&gt; This would create a credible [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamic]] message that could have been very dangerous for Britain, which was under stress, at that moment in severe difficulties in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]].  The British replied with a [[McMahon–Hussein Correspondence|letter from High Commissioner McMahon]] that was generally agreeable, while reserving commitments concerning the Mediterranean coastline and [[Holy Land]].

In the spring of 1916, Lawrence was dispatched to Mesopotamia to assist in relieving the [[Siege of Kut]] by some combination of starting an Arab uprising and bribing Ottoman officials.  This mission produced no useful result.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 256–276.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, unbeknown to the British officials in Cairo, the [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]] was being negotiated in London, which awarded a large proportion of Syria to France. Further, it implied that if the Arabs were to have any sort of state in Syria, they would have to conquer its four great cities: Damascus, Homs, Hama, and Aleppo. It is unclear at what point Lawrence became aware of the treaty's contents.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 313. In note 24 Wilson argues that, contrary to a later statement, Lawrence must have known about Sykes-Picot prior to his relationship with Faisal.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arab Revolt==
{{Main|Arab Revolt}}
[[File:Ljidda.jpg|thumb|Lawrence at [[Rabigh]], north of [[Jeddah]], 1917]]

The [[Arab Revolt]] began in June 1916, and after a few initial successes bogged down, with a real risk the Ottoman forces would advance along the coast of the Red Sea and recapture Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October 1916, Lawrence was sent to the Hejaz on an intelligence-gathering mission led by [[Ronald Storrs]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; He visited and interviewed three of Sharif Hussein's sons: [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali]], [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]], and [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 307–311.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that Faisal was the best candidate to lead the Revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, it was decided to assign [[S. F. Newcombe]] to lead a permanent British liaison to Faisal's staff.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; As Newcombe had not yet arrived in the area and the matter was of some urgency, Lawrence was sent in his place.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; In late December 1916, Faisal and Lawrence worked out a plan for repositioning the Arab forces to prevent the Ottoman forces around Medina from threatening Arab positions and putting the railway from Syria under threat.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 347. Also see note 43, where the origin of the repositioning idea is examined closely.&lt;/ref&gt; When Newcombe arrived and Lawrence was preparing to leave Arabia, Faisal intervened urgently, asking that Lawrence's assignment become permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence remained attached to Faisal's forces until the fall of Damascus in 1918.

Lawrence's most important contributions to the Arab Revolt were in the area of strategy and liaison with British armed forces but he also participated personally in several military engagements:

* 3 January 1917: Attack on an Ottoman outpost in the Hejaz.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 26 March 1917: Attack on the railway at Aba el Naam.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Garland of Arabia: the forgotten story of TE Lawrence's brother-in-arms|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7918929/Garland-of-Arabia-the-forgotten-story-of-TE-Lawrences-brother-in-arms.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=29 March 2014|date=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 11 June 1917: Attack on a bridge at [[Ras Baalbek]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2 July 1917: Defeat of the Ottoman forces at Aba el Lissan, an outpost of Aqaba.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 18 September 1917: Attack on the railway near [[Mudawwara|Mudawara]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p 446.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 27 September 1917: Attack on the railway, destroyed an engine.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Wilson doesn't say where - TODO: Consult other bios and 7PW --&gt;
* 7 November 1917: Following a failed attack on the [[Yarmouk River|Yarmuk]] bridges, blew up a train on the railway between Deraa and Amman, suffering several wounds in the explosion and ensuing combat.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 455–457.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 23 January 1918: The battle of [[Tafileh]], a region southeast of the [[Dead Sea]], with Arab regulars under the command of [[Jafar Pasha al-Askari]].&lt;ref name="Mack"/&gt; The battle was a defensive engagement that turned into an offensive rout&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, ''7 Pillars (1922)'', pp. 537–546.&lt;/ref&gt; and was described in the official history of the war as a "brilliant feat of arms".&lt;ref name="Mack"/&gt; Lawrence was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his leadership at Tafileh and was promoted to [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name="Mack"/&gt; The Arabs took the lives of 400 Turks and captured more than 200 prisoners.
* March 1918: Attack on the railway near Aqaba.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 19 April 1918: Attack using British armoured cars on Tell Shahm.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 16 September 1918: Destruction of railway bridge between Amman and Deraa.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 546.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 26 September 1918: Attack on retreating Ottomans and Germans near the village of [[Tafas]]; the Ottoman forces massacred the villagers and then Arab forces in return massacred their prisoners with Lawrence's encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 556-557.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1917, on the way to Aqaba, Lawrence made a 300-mile personal journey northward, visiting [[Ras Baalbek]], the outskirts of Damascus, and [[Azraq, Jordan|Azraq]].  He met Arab nationalists, counselling them to avoid revolt until the arrival of Faisal's forces, and attacked a bridge to create the impression of guerrilla activity. His findings were regarded by the British as extremely valuable and there was serious consideration of awarding him a [[Victoria Cross]]; in the end, he was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath and promoted to Major.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 424-425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence travelled regularly between British HQ and Faisal, co-ordinating military action.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt; But by early 1918, Faisal's chief British liaison was Colonel Pierce Charles Joyce, and Lawrence's time was chiefly devoted to raiding and intelligence-gathering.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1918, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the summer of 1918, the Turks were offering a substantial reward for Lawrence's capture, initially £5,000&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 424,&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually £20,000 (approx $2.1 million in 2017 dollars or £1.5 million).&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt; One officer wrote in his notes: "Though a price of £15,000 has been put on his head by the Turks, no Arab has, as yet, attempted to betray him. The Sharif of Mecca has given him the status of one of his sons, and he is just the finely tempered steel that supports the whole structure of our influence in Arabia. He is a very inspiring gentleman adventurer."&lt;ref name="Mack"&gt;Mack, 1976, p. 158, 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategy===
The chief elements of the Arab strategy, developed chiefly by Faisal and Lawrence, were firstly to avoid capturing [[Medina]], and secondly to extend northwards through Maan and Dera'a to Damascus and beyond. The Emir Faisal wanted to lead regular attacks against the Ottomans, which Lawrence persuaded him to drop.&lt;ref name="Morsey pages 185"&gt;Morsey, Konrad "T.E. Lawrence: Strategist" pages 185–203 from ''The T.E. Lawrence Puzzle'' edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence wrote about the Bedouin as a fighting force: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The value of the tribes is defensive only and their real sphere is guerilla warfare. They are intelligent, and very lively, almost reckless, but too individualistic to endure commands, or fight in line, or to help each other. It would, I think, be possible to make an organized force out of them...The Hejaz war is one of dervishes against regular forces-and we are on the side of the dervishes. Our text-books do not apply to its conditions at all".&lt;ref name="Morsey pages 185"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Medina was an attractive target for the revolt as Islam's second holiest site, and because its Ottoman garrison was weakened by disease and isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;  It became clear that it was advantageous to leave it there rather than try to capture it, while continually attacking, but not permanently breaking, the [[Hejaz railway]] south from Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, David (2008). "The Arab Revolt 1916–1918", London: Osprey, 2008 page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; This prevented the Ottomans from making effective use of their troops at Medina, and forced them to dedicate many resources to defending and repairing the railway line.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 329 describes a very early argument for letting the Ottomans stay in Medina in a November 1916 letter from Clayton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 383–384 describes Lawrence's arrival at this conclusion.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement north to Damascus and eventually Aleppo is interesting in the context of the Sykes-Picot agreement.  While it is not known when Lawrence learned the details of Sykes-Picot, nor if or when he briefed Faisal on what he knew,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 361–362 argues that Lawrence knew the details and briefed Faisal in February 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 444. shows Lawrence definitely knew of Sykes-Picot in September 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; there is good reason to think that both these things happened, and earlier rather than later.  In particular, the Arab strategy of northward extension makes perfect sense given the Sykes-Picot language that spoke of an independent Arab entity in Syria, which would only be granted if the Arabs liberated the territory themselves.  The French, and some of their British Liaison officers, were specifically uncomfortable about the northward movement, as it would weaken French colonial claims.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, pp. 390–391.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- save this for the cites
During the war, Lawrence fought alongside Arab [[irregular military|irregular troops]] under the command of [[Faisal I of Iraq|Emir Faisal]], a son of [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sharif Hussein]] of [[Mecca]], in extended [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] operations against the armed forces of the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence obtained assistance from the [[Royal Navy]] to turn back an Ottoman attack on [[Yanbu]] in December 1916.&lt;ref name="Parnell"&gt;Parnell, Charles L., CDR USN "Lawrence of Arabia's Debt to Seapower" US Naval Institute Proceedings (August 1979) p.76, 78&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence's major contribution to the revolt was convincing the Arab leaders (Faisal and [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]]) to co-ordinate their actions in support of British strategy. He persuaded the Arabs not to make a frontal assault on the Ottoman stronghold in [[Medina]] but to allow the Turkish army to tie up troops in the city garrison. The Arabs were then free to direct most of their attention to the Turks' weak point, the [[Hejaz railway]] that supplied the garrison. This vastly expanded the battlefield and tied up even more Ottoman troops, who were then forced to protect the railway and repair the constant damage. Lawrence developed a close relationship with Faisal, whose Arab Northern Army became the main beneficiary of British aid.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, David (2008). "The Arab Revolt 1916–1918", London: Osprey, 2008 page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacks on the railway continued throughout 1917. During one, Lawrence blew up a locomotive with an electric mine. "We had a [[Lewis gun|Lewis]] [machine gun]", he wrote in a letter to a friend, "and flung bullets through the sides. So they hopped out and took cover behind the embankment, and shot at us between the wheels at 50 yards." The Arabs brought up a [[Stokes mortar]], and the Turks fled across open ground. "Unfortunately for them", Lawrence continued, "the Lewis covered the open stretch. The whole job took ten minutes, and they lost 70 killed, 30 wounded and 80 prisoners", for the loss of only one Arab irregular. While the Arabs looted the train, another Turkish force arrived, nearly cutting off the Bedouins. "I lost some baggage, and nearly myself", Lawrence added nonchalantly. In another letter about that same "show", Lawrence confided, "I'm not going to last out this game much longer: nerves going and temper wearing thin. ... This killing and killing of Turks is horrible."&lt;ref name="Parnell"/&gt; --&gt;

===Capture of Aqaba===
{{Main|Battle of Aqaba}}
[[File:Lcamel.jpg|thumb|Lawrence at [[Aqaba]], 1917]]

In 1917, Lawrence successfully proposed a joint action with the Arab irregulars and forces including [[Auda Abu Tayi]] (until then in the employ of the Ottomans) against the strategically located but lightly defended&lt;ref&gt;"The bombardment of Akaba." ''The Naval Review''. Volume IV. 1916. p.101-103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Egyptian Expeditionary Force". ''Operations in the Gulf of Akaba, Red Sea HMS ''Raven'' II''. July—August 1916. National Archives, Kew London. File: AIR 1 /2284/ 209/75/8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Naval Operation in the Red Sea 1916—1917". ''The Naval Review'', Volume XIII, no.4 (1925). pp. 648–666.&lt;/ref&gt; town of [[Aqaba]] on the Red Sea. While Aqaba could have been captured by an attack from the sea, the narrow defiles leading inland through the mountains were strongly defended and would have been very difficult to assault.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, 1934, p. 161. "Akaba was so strongly protected by the hills, elaborately fortified for miles back, that if a landing were attempted from the sea a small Turkish force could hold up a whole Allied division in the defiles."&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was led by the well-respected Sharif Nasir of Medina.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence carefully avoided informing his British superiors about the details of the planned inland attack, due to concern that it would be blocked as contrary to French interests.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition departed from [[Wejh]] on 9 May.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; Aqaba fell to the Arab forces on 6 July, after a surprise overland attack, taking the Turkish defences from behind.

After Aqaba, [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Sir Edmund Allenby]], the new commander-in-chief of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]], agreed to Lawrence's strategy for the revolt, stating after the war:

{{quote|I gave him a free hand. His cooperation was marked by the utmost loyalty, and I never had anything but praise for his work, which, indeed, was invaluable throughout the campaign. He was the mainspring of the Arab movement and knew their language, their manners and their mentality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1935/may/19/fromthearchive "Strategist of the Desert Dies in Military Hospital".]  ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 16 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the fall of Aqaba, Lawrence held a powerful position as an adviser to Faisal and a person who had Allenby's confidence.

===Dera'a===
In both ''Seven Pillars'' and a 1919 letter to a military colleague,&lt;ref&gt;Letter to W.F. Stirling, Deputy Chief Political Officer, Cairo, 28 June 1919, in Brown, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence describes an episode on 20 November 1917 while reconnoitering [[Daraa|Dera'a]] in disguise when he was captured by the Ottoman military, heavily beaten, and sexually abused by the local [[bey]] and his guardsmen. The precise nature of the sexual contact is not specified. James Barr, author of ''Setting the Desert on Fire: T E Lawrence and Britain's Secret War in Arabia 1916-1918'', has claimed that the episode was invented and that Lawrence was never in or near Dera'a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Mack]], and Jeremy Wilson, have argued that this episode had strong psychological effects on Lawrence, which may explain some of his unconventional behaviour in later life. Lawrence ended his account of the episode in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' with the statement: "In Deraa that night the citadel of my integrity had been irrevocably lost."

===Fall of Damascus===
[[File:With Lawrence in Arabia.jpg|thumb|Lawrence in 1919]]

Lawrence was involved in the build-up to the capture of [[Damascus]] in the final weeks of the war. He was not present at the city's formal surrender, much to his disappointment and contrary to instructions that he had issued, having arrived several hours after the city had fallen. Lawrence entered Damascus around 9&amp;nbsp;am on 1 October 1918 but was the third arrival of the day; the first was the [[10th Light Horse Regiment (Australia)|10th Australian Light Horse Brigade]], led by Major A.C.N. 'Harry' Olden, who formally accepted the surrender of the city from acting Governor Emir Said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Barker, A|year=1998 |title =The Allies Enter Damascus|journal= History Today| volume= 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence was instrumental in establishing a provisional Arab government under Faisal in newly liberated Damascus – which he had envisioned as the capital of an Arab state. Faisal's rule as king, however, came to an abrupt end in 1920, after the [[battle of Maysaloun]], when the French Forces of [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|General Gouraud]] entered Damascus under the command of General [[Mariano Goybet]], destroying Lawrence's dream of an independent Arabia.

During the closing years of the war, Lawrence sought to convince his superiors in the British government that Arab independence was in their interests – with mixed success. The secret [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] between France and Britain contradicted the promises of independence that he had made to the Arabs and frustrated his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00qgtjk/The_Legacy_of_Lawrence_of_Arabia_Episode_2/|title=The Legacy of Lawrence of Arabia|volume=2|people=Rory Stewart (presenter)|publisher=BBC|date=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, he cooperated with [[war correspondent]] [[Lowell Thomas]] for a short period. During this time, Thomas and his cameraman Harry Chase shot a great deal of film and many photographs, which Thomas used in a highly lucrative slide-show presentation that toured the world after the war.

{{quote|[Lowell Thomas] went to Jerusalem where he met Lawrence, whose enigmatic figure in Arab uniform fired his imagination. With Allenby's permission he linked up with Lawrence for a brief couple of weeks ... Returning to America, Thomas, early in 1919, started his lectures, supported by moving pictures of veiled women, Arabs in their picturesque robes, camels and dashing Bedouin cavalry, which took the nation by storm, after running at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York. On being asked to come to England, he made the condition he would do so if asked by the King and given [[Drury Lane]] or [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] ... He opened at Covent Garden on 14 August 1919 ... And so followed a series of some hundreds of lectures – film shows, attended by the highest in the land ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Hall, Rex | date=1975| title= The Desert Hath Pearls| location=Melbourne| publisher= Hawthorn Press| pages= 120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Post-war years==

In August 1919, [[Lowell Thomas]] launched a colourful photo show in London entitled ''With Allenby in Palestine'', which included a lecture, dancing, and music.&lt;ref name="Murphy, David 2008, page 86"&gt;Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916–18'', London: Osprey, 2008, page 86&lt;/ref&gt; ''With Allenby in Palestine'' engaged in what was later deemed "[[Orientalism]]", the depiction of the Orient—as the Westerners called the Middle East up until World War II—as strange, exotic, mysterious, bizarre, sensuous, and violent.&lt;ref name="Murphy, David 2008, page 86"/&gt; Initially, Lawrence played only a supporting role in the show as the main focus was on Allenby's campaigns, but when Thomas realised that it was the photos of Lawrence dressed as a Bedouin that had captured the public's imagination, he had Lawrence photographed again in London in Arab dress.&lt;ref name="Murphy, David 2008, page 86"/&gt; With the new photos, Thomas re-launched his show under the new title ''With Allenby in Palestine and Lawrence in Arabia'' in early 1920, which proved to be extremely popular.&lt;ref name="Murphy, David 2008, page 86"/&gt; The new title elevating Lawrence from a supporting role to a co-star of the Near Eastern campaign reflected the changed emphasis. Thomas' shows made the previously obscure Lawrence into a household name.&lt;ref name="Murphy, David 2008, page 86"/&gt; Lawrence served for much of 1921 as an adviser to [[Winston Churchill]] at the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Office]]. Lawrence hated bureaucratic work, writing on 21 May 1921 to Robert Graves: "I wish I hadn't gone out there: the Arabs are like a page I have turned over; and sequels are rotten things. I'm locked up here: office every day and much of it".&lt;ref&gt;Klieman, Aaron "Lawrence as a Bureaucrat" pages 243–268 from ''The T.E. Lawrence Puzzle'' edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence had a sinister reputation in France, both during his lifetime and even today, being seen as an implacable "enemy of France"; the man who was supposedly constantly stirring up the Syrians to revolt against French rule throughout the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Larès, Maurice "T.E. Lawrence and France: Friends or Foes?" pages 220–242 from ''The T.E. Lawrence Puzzle'' edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 224 &amp; 236–237.&lt;/ref&gt; The French historian Maurice Larès wrote that the real reason for France's problems in Syria was that the Syrians did not want to be ruled by France, and the French needed a "scapegoat" to blame for their difficulties in ruling the country.&lt;ref name="Larès pages 220"&gt;Larès, Maurice "T.E. Lawrence and France: Friends or Foes?" pages 220–242 from ''The T.E. Lawrence Puzzle'' edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 236.&lt;/ref&gt; Larès wrote that far from being a Francophobe, as he is usually depicted in France, Lawrence was really a Francophile.&lt;ref name="Larès pages 220"/&gt; Larès wrote: "But we should note that a man rarely devotes much of his time and effort to the study of a language and of the literature of a people he hates, unless this is in order to work for its destruction (Eichmann's behavior may be an instance of this), which was clearly not Lawrence's case. Had Lawrence really disliked the French, would he, even for financial reasons, have translated French novels into English? The quality of his translation of ''Le Gigantesque''  (''The Forest Giant'') reveals not only his conscientiousness as an artist but also a knowledge of French that can scarcely have derived from unfriendly feelings".&lt;ref name="Larès pages 220"/&gt; Larès concluded that the popular thesis in France that Lawrence had "virulent anti-French prejudices" is not supported by the facts.&lt;ref name="Larès pages 220"/&gt;

In August 1922, Lawrence enlisted in the [[Royal Air Force]] as an [[aircraftman]], under the name '''John Hume Ross'''. At the RAF recruiting centre in Covent Garden, London, he was interviewed by recruiting officer [[Flying Officer]] [[W. E. Johns]], later known as the author of the [[Biggles]] series of novels.&lt;ref&gt;Biography of Johns, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Johns rejected Lawrence's application as he correctly believed that "Ross" was a false name. Lawrence admitted that this was so and that the documents he had provided were false. He left, but returned some time later with an RAF messenger, who carried a written order that Johns must accept Lawrence.&lt;ref&gt;Orlans, 2002, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Lawrence was forced out of the RAF in February 1923 after his identity was exposed. He changed his name to '''T. E. Shaw''' and joined the [[Royal Tank Corps]] later that year. He was unhappy there and repeatedly petitioned to rejoin the RAF, which finally readmitted him in August 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillingdon.gov.uk/index.jsp?articleid=8998 |title=T.

Lawrence |date=23 October 2007 |publisher=London Borough of Hillingdon |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fresh burst of publicity after the publication of ''[[Revolt in the Desert]]'' resulted in his assignment, to bases at [[Karachi]] and then [[Miramshah]], in then [[British Raj|British India]] (now Pakistan) in late 1926,&lt;ref name="SydneySmith"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sydney Smith |first1=Clare |title=The Golden Reign - The story of my friendship with Lawrence of Arabia |date=1940 |publisher=Cassell &amp; Company |location=London |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained until the end of 1928. At that time, he was forced to return to Britain after rumours began to circulate that he was involved in espionage activities.

He purchased several small plots of land in [[Chingford]], built a hut and swimming pool there, and visited frequently. The hut was removed in 1930 when the Chingford [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District Council]] acquired the land. The hut was given to the [[City of London Corporation]], which re-erected it in the grounds of The Warren, [[Loughton]]. Lawrence's tenure of the Chingford land has now been commemorated by a plaque fixed on the sighting obelisk on [[Pole Hill]].

Lawrence continued serving in the RAF based at [[RAF Mount Batten]] near Plymouth, [[RAF Calshot]], near Southampton, and [[Bridlington]], East Riding of Yorkshire, specialising in high-speed boats and professing happiness, and it was with considerable regret that he left the service at the end of his enlistment in March 1935.

In the inter-war period, the RAF's [[Royal Air Force Marine Branch|Marine Craft Section]] began to have built for it [[air-sea rescue]] launches capable of higher speeds and greater capacity. The arrival of high-speed craft into the MCS was driven in part by Lawrence. He had previously witnessed the drowning of the crew of a seaplane when the [[seaplane tender]] sent to their rescue was too slow in arriving. Working with [[Hubert Scott-Paine]], the founder of the [[British Power Boat Company]] (BPBC), the {{convert|37.5|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long ST 200 Seaplane Tender Mk1 was introduced into service. These boats had a range of 140 miles when cruising at 24 knots, and could achieve a top speed of 29 knots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Among the books that Lawrence is known to have carried with him on his military campaigns is [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. Accounts of the 1934 discovery of the [[Winchester Manuscript]] of the ''Morte'' include a report that, after reading about the discovery in ''[[The Times]]'', Lawrence followed Malory scholar [[Eugene Vinaver]] from [[Manchester]] to [[Winchester]] by motorcycle.&lt;ref&gt;Walter F.

At the age of 46, two months after leaving military service, Lawrence was fatally injured in an accident on his [[Brough Superior SS100]] motorcycle in [[Dorset]], close to his cottage, [[Clouds Hill]], near [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]]. A dip in the road obstructed his view of two boys on their bicycles; he swerved to avoid them, lost control, and was thrown over the handlebars.&lt;ref name="BBC Lawrence"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/oxford/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8130000/8130638.stm |publisher=BBC |title=T.

One of the doctors attending him was [[neurosurgeon]] [[Hugh Cairns (surgeon)|Hugh Cairns]], who consequently began a long study of the unnecessary loss of life by motorcycle dispatch riders through head injuries. His research led to the use of [[Motorcycle helmet|crash helmets]] by both military and civilian motorcyclists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurosurgery-online.com/pt/re/neurosurg/abstract.00006123-200201000-00026.htm;jsessionid=LjXXhLWV91Gj2H4GlTrvw2pbgDqDFHTmB0h0WsgfvpzLQpXr3QxY!-341159882!181195629!8091!-1|title=Lawrence of Arabia, Sir Hugh Cairns, and the Origin of Motor... : Neurosurgery|work=LWW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Moreton, Dorset|Moreton]] estate, which borders [[Bovington Camp]], was owned by Lawrence's cousins, the Frampton family. Lawrence had rented and later bought Clouds Hill from the Framptons. He had been a frequent visitor to their home, Okers Wood House, and had for years corresponded with Louisa Frampton. Lawrence's mother arranged with the Framptons to have him buried in their family plot in the separate burial ground of [[St Nicholas' Church, Moreton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kerrigan|first=Michael|title=Who Lies Where – A guide to famous graves|year=1998|publisher=Fourth Estate Limited|location=London|isbn=978-1-85702-258-2|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

==Writings==
Lawrence was a prolific writer throughout his life. A large portion of his output was [[wikt:epistolary|epistolary]]. He often sent several letters a day. Several collections of his letters have been published. He corresponded with many notable figures, including [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Robert Graves]], [[Noël Coward]], [[E. M. Forster]], [[Siegfried Sassoon]], [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|John Buchan]], [[Augustus John]], and [[Henry Williamson]]. He met [[Joseph Conrad]] and commented perceptively on his works. The many letters that he sent to Shaw's wife [[Charlotte Payne-Townshend|Charlotte]] are revealing as to his character.&lt;ref name="C-Shaw-Letters"&gt;{{cite book|author= T. E. Lawrence| title= Correspondence with Bernard and Charlotte Shaw, 1922—1926 | volume= 1 |editor=Jeremy and Nicole Wilson |publisher= Castle Hill Press|year=2000}} Foreword by Jeremy Wilson.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence's polyglottism enabled him to communicate  throughout his travels. It is acknowledged that he could speak French, German, Greek, Latin, Syriac, Turkish and Welsh, and had demonstrated adeptness in learning other [[dialects]] and [[ancient languages]].&lt;ref name="Korda2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Korda|title=Hero: The Life &amp; Legend of Lawrence of Arabia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzLBAgAAQBAJ|date=24 March 2011|publisher=Aurum Press|isbn=978-1-84513-837-0|pages=1–(x)? –– "Who Is This Extraordinary Pip–Squeak?"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence published three major texts in his lifetime. The most significant was his account of the Arab Revolt, ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''.  Two were translations: [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and [[The Forest Giant (book)|''The Forest Giant'']], the latter an otherwise forgotten work of French fiction. He received a flat fee for the second translation, and negotiated a generous fee plus [[royalties]] for the first.

===''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''===
[[File:Thomas Edward Lawrence-London Barton St.JPG|thumb|14 Barton Street, London SW1, where Lawrence lived while writing ''Seven Pillars'']]
{{main|Seven Pillars of Wisdom}}
Lawrence's major work is ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'', an account of his war experiences. In 1919, he had been elected to a seven-year research fellowship at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], providing him with support while he worked on the book. In addition to being a memoir of his experiences during the war, certain parts also serve as essays on [[military strategy]], Arabian culture and [[geography]], and other topics. Lawrence re-wrote ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' three times, once "blind" after he lost the [[manuscript]] while changing trains at [[Reading railway station]].

The list of his alleged "embellishments" in ''Seven Pillars'' is long, though many such allegations have been disproved with time, most definitively in [[Jeremy Wilson]]'s [[Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorised Biography of T. E. Lawrence|authorised biography]]. However, Lawrence's own notebooks refute his claim to have crossed the [[Sinai Peninsula]] from [[Aqaba]] to the [[Suez Canal]] in just 49 hours without any sleep. In reality, this famous camel ride lasted for more than 70 hours and was interrupted by two long breaks for sleeping, which Lawrence omitted when he wrote his book.&lt;ref&gt;Asher, 1998, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence acknowledged having been helped in the editing of the book by [[George Bernard Shaw]]. In the preface to ''Seven Pillars'', Lawrence offered his "thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Shaw for countless suggestions of great value and diversity: and for all the present [[semicolon]]s".

The first public edition was published in 1926 as a high-priced private subscription edition, printed in London by [[Herbert John Hodgson]] and Roy Manning Pike, with illustrations by [[Eric Kennington]], [[Augustus John]], [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[Blair Hughes-Stanton]], and Hughes-Stanton's wife [[Gertrude Hermes]]. Lawrence was afraid that the public would think that he would make a substantial income from the book, and he stated that it was written as a result of his war service. He vowed not to take any money from it, and indeed he did not, as the sale price was one third of the production costs.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, 1928, ch. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; This, along with his "saintlike" generosity, left Lawrence in substantial debt.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, 1976, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Revolt in the Desert''===
[[File:Ljohn.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Augustus John]], 1919]]

''[[Revolt in the Desert]]'' was an abridged version of ''Seven Pillars'' that he began in 1926 and that was published in March 1927 in both limited and trade editions.&lt;ref&gt;''Grand Strategies; Literature, Statecraft, and World Order'', Yale University Press, 2010, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook a needed but reluctant publicity exercise, which resulted in a best-seller. Again he vowed not to take any fees from the publication, partly to appease the subscribers to ''Seven Pillars'' who had paid dearly for their editions. By the fourth reprint in 1927, the debt from ''Seven Pillars'' was paid off. As Lawrence left for military service in India at the end of 1926, he set up the "Seven Pillars Trust" with his friend [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] as a trustee, in which he made over the copyright and any surplus income of ''Revolt in the Desert''. He later told Hogarth that he had "made the Trust final, to save myself the temptation of reviewing it, if ''Revolt'' turned out a best seller."{{cite this quote|date=May 2018}}

The resultant trust paid off the debt, and Lawrence then invoked a clause in his publishing contract to halt publication of the abridgment in the United Kingdom. However, he allowed both American editions and translations, which resulted in a substantial flow of income. The trust paid income either into an educational fund for children of RAF officers who lost their lives or were invalided as a result of service, or more substantially into the [[RAF Benevolent Fund]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Posthumous===
Lawrence left unpublished ''[[The Mint (book)|The Mint]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Doubleday, Doran &amp; Co, New York, 1936; rprnt Penguin, Harmondsworth,1984 {{ISBN|0-14-004505-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a memoir of his experiences as an enlisted man in the Royal Air Force (RAF). For this, he worked from a notebook that he kept while enlisted, writing of the daily lives of enlisted men and his desire to be a part of something larger than himself: the Royal Air Force. The book is stylistically very different from ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'', using sparse prose as opposed to the complicated syntax found in ''Seven Pillars''. It was published posthumously, edited by his brother, Professor [[A. W. Lawrence]].

After Lawrence's death, A. W. Lawrence inherited Lawrence's estate and his copyrights as the sole beneficiary. To pay the inheritance tax, he sold the US copyright of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' (subscribers' text) outright to [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday Doran]] in 1935.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Doubleday still controls publication rights of this version of the text of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' in the US, and will continue to do until the copyright expires at the end of 2022 (publication plus 95 years). In 1936 Prof. Lawrence split the remaining assets of the estate, giving Clouds Hill and many copies of less substantial or historical letters to the nation via the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], and then set up two trusts to control interests in T. E. Lawrence's residual copyrights.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} To the original Seven Pillars Trust, Prof. Lawrence assigned the copyright in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'', as a result of which it was given its first general publication. To the Letters and Symposium Trust, he assigned the copyright in ''The Mint'' and all Lawrence's letters,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} which were subsequently edited and published in the book ''T. E. Lawrence by his Friends'' (edited by A. W. Lawrence, London, Jonathan Cape, 1937).

A substantial amount of income went directly to the RAF Benevolent Fund or for archaeological, environmental, or academic projects. The two trusts were amalgamated in 1986 and, on the death of Prof. A. W. Lawrence in 1991, the unified trust also acquired all the remaining rights to Lawrence's works that it had not owned, plus rights to all of Prof. Lawrence's works.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The UK copyrights of Lawrence's works published in his lifetime and within 20 years of his death had expired by the end of 2005. Works published more than 20 years after his death were protected for 50 years from publication.

==Sexuality==
Lawrence's biographers have discussed his sexuality at considerable length, and this discussion has spilled into the popular press.&lt;ref&gt;The Sunday Times pieces appeared on 9, 16, 23 and 30  June 1968, and were based mostly on the narrative of John Bruce.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no reliable evidence for consensual sexual intimacy between Lawrence and any person.  His friends have expressed the opinion that he was [[Asexuality|asexual]],&lt;ref&gt;E.H.R. Altounyan in Lawrence, A. W., 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Simpson, 1970, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; and Lawrence himself specifically denied, in multiple private letters, any personal experience of sex.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 1988, letters to [[E. M. Forster]] (21 Dec 1927), [[Robert Graves]] (6 Nov 1928), [[F. L. Lucas]] (26 March 1929).&lt;/ref&gt; There were suggestions that Lawrence had been intimate with Dahoum, who worked with him at a pre-war archaeological dig in Carchemish,&lt;ref name="Woolley"&gt;C. Leonard Woolley in A. W. Lawrence, 1937, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; and fellow-serviceman R. A. M. Guy,&lt;ref name="Wilson32"&gt;Wilson, 1989, chapter 32.&lt;/ref&gt; but his biographers and contemporaries have found them unconvincing.&lt;ref name="Woolley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson32"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1989 , chapter 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dedication to his book ''Seven Pillars'' is a poem titled "To S.A." which opens:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
I loved you, so I drew these tides of men into my hands
                    and wrote my will across the sky in stars
To earn you Freedom, the seven-pillared worthy house,
                    that your eyes might be shining for me
                              When we came.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Lawrence was never specific about the identity of "S.A." Many theories argue in favour of individual men or women, and the Arab nation as a whole. The most popular theory is that S.A. represents (at least in part) his companion Selim Ahmed, "Dahoum"—who apparently died of [[typhus]] before 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Lawrence lived in a period of strong official opposition to homosexuality, but his writing on the subject was tolerant. In a letter to [[Charlotte Payne-Townshend|Charlotte Shaw]], he wrote, "I've seen lots of man-and-man loves: very lovely and fortunate some of them were."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Charlotte Shaw in Mack, 1976, p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to "the openness and honesty of perfect love" on one occasion in ''Seven Pillars'', when discussing relationships between young male fighters in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There is considerable evidence that Lawrence was a [[Sadomasochism|masochist]]. In his description of the Dera'a beating, Lawrence wrote: "a delicious warmth, probably sexual, was swelling through me," and also included a detailed description of the guards' whip in a style typical of masochists' writing.&lt;ref&gt;Knightley and Simpson, 1970, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; In later life, Lawrence arranged to pay a military colleague to administer beatings to him,&lt;ref name="TimesBruce"&gt;{{cite news

E. Lawrence Puzzle'' edited by Stephen Tabachnick, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984 page 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[John E. Mack]] sees a possible connection between T.

===Film===
* [[Alexander Korda]] bought the film rights to ''The Seven Pillars'' in the 1930s. The production was in development, with various actors cast as the lead, such as [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article30091256 |title=PICTURES AND PERSONALITIES. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]|location=Hobart, Tas. |date=15 June 1935 |accessdate=7 July 2012 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Hudd]] and [[John Clements (actor)|John Clements]], but ultimately it came to nothing.
* Lawrence was portrayed by [[Peter O'Toole]] in the 1962 film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', for which he was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. 
* Lawrence is portrayed by [[Robert Pattinson]] in the 2014 biographical drama about Gertrude Bell, ''[[Queen of the Desert (film)|Queen of the Desert]]''.
* Lawrence inspired behavioural affectations in the synthetic model called David, portrayed by [[Michael Fassbender]] in the 2012 film ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'', and in the 2017 sequel ''[[Alien: Covenant]]''—part of the [[Alien (franchise)|Alien franchise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=McGurk | first=Stuart | date=May 12, 2017 | title=Alien: Covenant is great - but the aliens are the worst thing about it | work=[[GQ]] | url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/alien-covenant-review-michael-fassbender | access-date=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===

* [[Ralph Fiennes]] portrayed Lawrence in the 1992 British made-for-TV movie ''[[A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia]]''.
* [[Joseph A. Bennett]] and [[Douglas Henshall]] portrayed him in the 1992 TV series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]''. In ''Young Indiana Jones'', Lawrence is portrayed as being a lifelong friend of the [[Indiana Jones|title character]].
* He was also portrayed in a Syrian series, directed by Thaer Mousa, called ''Lawrence Al Arab''. The series consisted of 37 episodes, each between 45 minutes and one hour in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istikana.com/en/tv_shows/lawrence-alarab|title=Istikana – Lawrence Alarab... Al-Khdi3a – Episode 1|work=Istikana}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Spike's season 3 of Deadliest Warrior, Lawrence was pitted against Theodore Roosevelt and lost.

===Theatre===
*Lawrence was the subject of [[Terence Rattigan]]'s controversial play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'', which explored Lawrence's alleged homosexuality. ''Ross'' ran in London in 1960–61, starring [[Alec Guinness]], who was an admirer of Lawrence, and [[Gerald Harper]] as his blackmailer, Dickinson. The play had originally been written as a screenplay, but the planned film was never made. In January 1986 at the [[Theatre Royal, Plymouth]], on the opening night of the revival of ''Ross'', [[Marc Sinden]], who was playing Dickinson (the man who recognised and blackmailed Lawrence, played by [[Simon Ward]]), was introduced to the man on whom the character of Dickinson was based. Sinden asked him why he had blackmailed Ross, and he replied, "Oh, for the money. I was financially embarrassed at the time and needed to get up to London to see a girlfriend. It was never meant to be a big thing, but a good friend of mine was very close to Terence Rattigan and years later, the silly devil told him the story."&lt;ref&gt;''Western Morning News'' 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Guinness would play [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]] in ''Lawrence of Arabia'' a year later.
*[[Alan Bennett]]'s ''[[Forty Years On (play)|Forty Years On]]'' (1968) includes a satire on Lawrence; known as "Tee Hee Lawrence" because of his high-pitched, girlish giggle. "Clad in the magnificent white silk robes of an Arab prince&amp;nbsp;... he hoped to pass unnoticed through London. Alas he was mistaken." The section concludes with the headmaster confusing him with [[D. H. Lawrence]]. 
*The character of Private Napoleon Meek in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1931 play ''[[Too True to Be Good]]'' was inspired by Lawrence. Meek is depicted as thoroughly conversant with the language and lifestyle of the native tribes. He repeatedly enlists with the army, quitting whenever offered a promotion. Lawrence attended a performance of the play's original Worcestershire run, and reportedly signed autographs for patrons attending the show.&lt;ref&gt;Korda, 2010, p. 670-671.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lawrence's first year back at Oxford after the War to write was portrayed by Tom Rooney in a play, ''The Oxford Roof Climbers Rebellion'', written by Canadian playwright [[Stephen Massicotte]] (premiered Toronto 2006). The play explores Lawrence's reactions to war, and his friendship with [[Robert Graves]]. Urban Stages presented the American premiere in New York City in October 2007; Lawrence was portrayed by actor Dylan Chalfy.
*Lawrence's final years are portrayed in a one-man show by [[Raymond Sargent]], ''The Warrior and the Poet.'' 
*His 1922 retreat from public life forms the subject of [[Howard Brenton]]'s play ''[[Lawrence After Arabia]]'', commissioned for a 2016 premiere at the [[Hampstead Theatre]] to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the Arab Revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.cft.org.uk/whats-on/event/ross | title=Book theatre tickets at Chichester| date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
*Lawrence was portrayed by [[Jack Lowden]] in the 2016 video game ''[[Battlefield 1]]'', as a secondary character to the main protagonist Zara Ghufran, in the single-player War Story "Nothing Is Written".
*Lawrence's travels in Syria and France were a major plot point in ''[[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception]]''. He was said to have made it partway through the trail followed by [[Nathan Drake (character)|Nathan Drake]], and Lawrence's fictional writings on the subject were invaluable to Drake.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4402">'''Tadeusz Estreicher''' (19 December 1871 &amp;ndash; 8 April 1952) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[chemist]], [[historian]] and [[cryogenics]] pioneer.

==Life==
Tadeusz Estreicher was born in [[Kraków]] when it was part of the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]]. He grew up in the intellectual atmosphere of an influential dynasty of professors at the [[Jagiellonian University]]. His father, [[Karol Estreicher (senior)|Karol Józef Estreicher]], was a historian of literature and the chief librarian of the university. His brother, [[Stanisław Estreicher|Stanisław]], was a historian of law and his sister, Maria, was one of the first women in [[Austria-Hungary]] to earn a doctorate (in English Philology).

Estreicher studied in [[Berlin]], [[Leipzig]], and in [[London]] under [[William Ramsay]]. As a student at the Jagiellonian University, Estreicher worked as an assistant to [[Karol Olszewski]], the first chemist to [[liquefy]] [[oxygen]]. After having been appointed assistant in 1899, Estreicher successfully liquefied [[hydrogen]] in 1901 before he was promoted to ''Privatdozent'' in 1904.

In 1900, he described the [[Jagiellonian globe]] in the ''Transactions of the Cracow Academy of Sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;Tadeusz Estreicher, ''Globus Biblioteki Jagiellońskiej z początku wieku XVI, w Krakowie,'' Nakładem Akademii Umięjetności, 1900, 18 pp [https://archive.org/stream/rozprawywydziau23filogoog#page/n11/mode/2up]; a resumé, "Ein Erdglobus aus dem Anfange des XVI. Jahrhunderts in der Jagellonischen Bibliothek", was published in the ''Bulletin international de l'Académie des Sciences de Cracovie/ Anzeiger der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Krakau,'' No.2, February 1900, pp.96-105. Estreicher prepared a manuscript English translation in March 1900: A globe of the beginning of the 16th century in the Jagellon Library, Extract from the Official Report of the Cracow Academy of Sciences, Globus Biblioteki Jagiellonskiej z początku w. XVI, No.12, January 1900, National Library of Australia MS 760/12/199. [https://skydrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=8FB4A3C963F402BE!131&amp;cid=8fb4a3c963f402be]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1906 until 1919 he worked in [[Switzerland]] a professor for mineral and general chemistry at the [[University of Fribourg]] where he ran a [[cryogenics]] laboratory. From 1913 to 1914 he also served as dean of the department.

In 1919, aged 47, he returned to newly independent [[Second Republic of Poland|Poland]] and took a position with the Jagiellonian University where he remained until his retirement. His later work examined the history and language of science.

On 6 November 1939, along with his brother Stanisław and other professors of the University, Estreicher was caught in [[Sonderaktion Krakau]]. Both were transported to the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]], where his brother died on 28 December 1939. Tadeusz survived the camp and was released in February 1940, following protests from European academics to the Nazi German government.

'''''The Source''''' is a [[historical novel]] by [[James A. Michener]], first published in 1965.  It is a survey of the [[Jewish history|history of the Jewish people]] and the [[land of Israel]] from [[monotheism|pre-monotheistic]] days to the birth of the modern [[State of Israel]].  ''The Source'' uses, for its central device, a fictional ''[[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]'' in northern Israel called "Makor" ({{lang-he|"source"}}). Prosaically, the name comes from a freshwater well just north of Makock, but symbolically it stands for much more, historically and spiritually.

Unlike most Michener novels, this book is not in strict chronological order. A parallel [[frame story]] set in Israel in the 1960s supports the historical timeline. [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] digging at the ''tell'' at Makor uncover artifacts from each layer, which then serve as the basis for a chapter exploring the lives of the people involved with that artifact. The book follows the story of the Family of Ur from a [[Stone Age]] family whose wife begins to believe that there is a supernatural force, which slowly leads us to the beginnings of [[monotheism]]. The descendants are not aware of the ancient antecedents revealed to the reader by the all-knowing writer as the story progresses through the [[David]]ic kingdom, [[Hellenistic]] times, [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, etc.  The site is continually inhabited until the end of the [[Crusades]] when it is destroyed by the victorious [[Mameluk]]s (as happened to many actual cities after 1291) and is not rebuilt by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]].

==Chapter list==
#The Tell – 1963, three archeologists, a Jew, a Catholic, and a Muslim, are at a modern archeological dig. The story moves back and forth between the historical chapters and the modern dig at the ''tell'' at Makor.
#The [[Bee eater|Bee-Eater]] (Level XV, 9831 BCE) – Introduction to the Ur family in [[History of the Levant#Stone Age|Stone Age]] times and their first move into an agricultural society.
#Of Death and Life (Level XIV, 2202 BCE) – Starting prior to 2000 BCE, the concept of an ultimate supreme being takes root with the introduction of the [[El (deity)|Cult of El]], as are some barbaric and mystic practices, like child sacrifice and temple prostitution.
#An Old Man and His God – [[Bronze Age Levant#Bronze Age|Bronze Age]], an early view of Hebrews as they moved from the desert life into [[Canaan]] and brought along the early teachings of [[El Shaddai]]. Makor is sacked by the Hebrews in 1491 BCE.
#Psalm of the [[Hoopoe]] Bird – Takes place 1040–970 BCE, during the last years of [[King David]].
#The Voice of Gomer – Takes place 605 BCE – 562 BCE. Following the Egyptian defeat at the [[Battle of Carchemish]], [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] marches into the Levant and deports the [[Babylonian captivity|Jews to Babylon]].
#In the Gymnasium – 222–187 BCE, Jewish life under the [[Seleucid Empire]].
#King of the Jews – 74 BCE – 4 CE: this chapter is told in [[epistolary novel|epistolary]] form and describes the rise of the ambitious [[Herod the Great]] to his eventual downfall into madness.
#Yigal and His Three Generals – 12-70 CE: this chapter begins with rule of the mad [[Caligula]] and his attempt to force idolatry on the Jews. After his death, he was replaced by the madder [[Nero]], who ordered [[Vespasian]] to repress [[Josephus]] and the [[Great Jewish Revolt|Jewish rebellion]].
#The Law – This chapter takes place after the [[Helena (Empress)#Relic discoveries|Empress Helena's]] pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Christianity is being forced in [[Galilee]] as churches are mass-produced. This chapter is about two Jews who convert to Christianity due to the strictness of the Talmud (during this time the [[Gemara]] is being written), but are soon disenfranchised by the [[Schism (religion)#Christianity|Christian Schism]]. This chapter is also the fictional origin of [[St. Mark]].
#A Day in the Life of a Desert Rider – This chapter begins with the introduction of [[Islam]] to the Holy Land by [[Muslim conquests]].
#Volkmar – This chapter opens with [[Peter the Hermit]] as he travels the European countryside in search of participants for the ill-fated [[People's Crusade]]. It concludes with the [[Crusades#First Crusade 1095–1099|First Crusade and the Siege of Jerusalem]].
#The Fires of Ma Coeur – In 1291, the last crusader strongholds begin to fall to the [[Mamaluk]]s. The final stronghold is [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Acre]].
#The Saintly Men of Safed – This chapter focuses on the three Rabbis who meet in [[Safed]] while escaping the [[Spanish Inquisition#Expulsion of Jews and repression of conversos|Spanish Inquisition]] and European [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms]], and their culture clashes between [[Sephardim]], [[Ashkenazim]] and [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] traditions.
#Twilight of an Empire – In the 1880s the [[Ottoman Empire]] is [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|falling apart]] and this chapter delves into the deep corruption in the public administration and Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]'s backlash at [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|reform]].
#Rebbe Itzik and the Sabra – 1948 – The new state of [[Israel]] starts to emerge.  This chapter deals with the origins of two characters in the present day narrative – Ilan Eliav and Vered Bar El.
#The Tell – culmination of the novel and rediscovery of the well built and described in the previous chapter Psalm of the Hoopoe Bird.

==Recurring symbols and themes==

===Fertility/The phallic===
In the early civilizations, the concept of fertility sprouts from agriculture and the desire for a fruitful harvest. During the earliest layer of history, the giant stone idol named El is created to please the earth and bring good crops.

As society moves away from a rural and agricultural existence, fertility is given less and less importance. The phallic is present from the [[Stone Age]] ("The Bee Eater"), until 606 BCE ("The Voice of Gomer").

===Prayer===
Later, as modern Judaism begins to take form, the theme of dedication and tenacity is brought forward again and again. The final words of many of the book's characters are of prayer; they are defending their religion with their life. As anti-semitism becomes more prevalent, this theme grows stronger, as if to show the strength of the faith that the Jewish people hold.

{{Politics of Fiji}}
{{History of Fiji}}
The following [[Chronology|timeline]] chronicles the '''[[2005–06 Fijian political crisis|crisis]]''' that saw a virtual breakdown in relations between [[Fiji]]'s government and [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|military fores]] in late 2005 and early 2006, until it was resolved on 16 January with a truce brokered by [[Vice-President of Fiji|Acting]] [[President of Fiji|President]] [[Ratu]] [[Joni Madraiwiwi]].

''Source: [[Fiji Times]], 15 January 2006; some details from other sources.'' &lt;!--This is only a beginning.  It needs to be fleshed out much more.  I'll get around to that in the next couple of days - but if you want to help me, please do!--&gt;

'''9 January 2006 (Monday), 8.00 a.m.:''' [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama|Josaia Vorege (Frank) Bainimarama]], the Commander of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces]], meets senior officers and allegedly orders them to free him by force in the event of his arrest.

Despite his role in the appointment of an interim government in 2000, many of whose members form the nucleus of the present government, Bainimarama has since grown disenchanted with it, accusing it of dealing too leniently with convicted perpetrators of a [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|civilian coup]] and [[Mutinies of the 2000 Fijian coup d'état|two army mutinies]] that rocked Fiji in 2000.

'''10 January 2006 (Tuesday), 8.30 a.m.:''' Acting Land Force Commander [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Jone Baledrokadroka]] meets with Senior Military Officers to solicit their endorsement.

'''11 January 2006 (Wednesday), 10.30 a.m.:''' Baledrokadroka explains to Bainimarama that the purpose of the previous day's meeting had been [[Reverse psychology]], a military tactic to expose traitors.  Bainimarama claims to have believed him.

'''12 January 2006 (Thursday):'''
* Bainimarama calls Baledrokadroka to cancel a scheduled meeting.
* 8.30 a.m.: Baledrokdroka meets with all senior officers to outline plans as new Acting Land Force Commander, and orders closure of gates, which reopen at 2 p.m..

'''13 January 2006 (Friday):'''
* 9.30 a.m.: Baledrokadroka confronts Bainimarama, asking for his resignation. 
* 10.00 a.m.: Bainimarama dismisses Baledrokadroka, claiming to have established that the true purpose of meetings held on the [[January 10|10th]] was to plot against him as Commander.

'''14 January 2006 (Saturday):''' Bainimarama accuses Baledrokadroka of having threatened to shoot him.  Baledrokadroka angrily denies this.

'''16 January 2006 (Monday):''' Acting [[President of Fiji|President]] [[Ratu]] [[Joni Madraiwiwi]] brokers a truce between the Military Commander and the government.

The '''''verracos''''' ({{lang-es|verraco}}; {{lang-pt|berrão}}; literally 'boar'), in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], are the [[Vettones]]'s [[granite]] [[megalith]]ic monuments, sculptures of animals as found in the west of the [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] ''[[Meseta Central|meseta]]'' - the high central plain of the [[Iberian peninsula]] - in the [[Spain|Spanish]] provinces of [[Ávila (province)|Ávila]], [[Salamanca (province)|Salamanca]], [[Segovia (province)|Segovia]], [[Salamanca (province)|Salamanca]], [[Zamora (province)|Zamora]], and [[Caceres (province)|Cáceres]], but also in the north of [[Portugal]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Over 400 ''verracos'' have been identified. 

The Spanish word ''verraco'' normally refers to boars, and the sculptures are sometimes called ''verracos de piedra'' (pigs of stone) to distinguish them from live animals. The stone verracos appear to represent not only pigs but also other animals.  Some have been identified as bulls, and the village of [[El Oso, Ávila]], named for "the Bear", has a verraco which supposedly represents a bear.
Their dates range from the mid-4th to 1st centuries BC.
There are some similar [[zoomorphic]] monument markers in lands of Poland from the same period or older.
{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Though they were perhaps not confined to a single usage, the ''verracos'' were an essential part of the landscape of the [[Vettones]], one of the  [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula]]. It has generally been assumed, from their high visibility in their original open fields surroundings, that these sculptures had some protective religious significance, whether guarding the security of livestock or as funerary monuments (some of them bear Latin funerary inscriptions). The ''verracos'' are particularly numerous too in the vicinity of the walled [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] communities that Romans had called ''[[oppidum|oppida]].''

'''William Butler Yeats'''{{efn|Pronounced {{IPAc-en|j|eɪ|t|s}} {{respell|YAYTS}}, rhyming with ''gates''.}} (13 June 1865{{spaced ndash}}28 January 1939) was an Irish [[poet]] and one of the foremost figures of [[20th century in literature|20th-century literature]]. A pillar of the Irish literary establishment, he helped to found the [[Abbey Theatre]], and in his later years served as a [[Seanad Éireann (Irish Free State)|Senator]] of the [[Irish Free State]] for two terms. He was a driving force behind the [[Irish Literary Revival]] along with [[Augusta, Lady Gregory|Lady Gregory]], [[Edward Martyn]] and others.

Yeats was born in [[Sandymount]], Ireland and educated there and in London. He spent childhood holidays in [[County Sligo]] and studied poetry from an early age when he became fascinated by [[Irish mythology|Irish legends]] and the [[occult]]. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display debts to [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and the poets of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. From 1900, his poetry grew more physical and [[Realism (literature)|realistic]]. He largely renounced the transcendental beliefs of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with physical and spiritual masks, as well as with cyclical theories of life. In 1923, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
William Butler Yeats was born at [[Sandymount]] in [[County Dublin]], Ireland.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt; His father, [[John Butler Yeats]] (1839–1922), was a descendant of Jervis Yeats, a [[William III of England|Williamite]] soldier, linen merchant, and well-known painter who died in 1712.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffares, A.

Gowran, its connection with the Butler Family|author=[[Margaret Phelan|Margaret M. Phelan]] |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their marriage, they kept the name Butler. Mary was a descendant of the Butler of Ormond family from the Neigham (pronounced Nyam) [[Gowran]] branch.

By his marriage, William's father John Yeats was studying law but abandoned his studies to study art at [[Heatherley School of Fine Art]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/index.htm|title=Ricorso: Digital materials for the study and appreciation of Anglo-Irish Literature|website=www.ricorso.net|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, [[Susan Pollexfen|Susan Mary Pollexfen]], came from a wealthy merchant family in [[Sligo]], who owned a milling and shipping business. Soon after William's birth the family relocated to the Pollexfen home at Merville, Sligo to stay with her extended family, and the young poet came to think of the area as his childhood and spiritual home. Its landscape became, over time, both literally and symbolically, his "country of the heart".{{sfn|Yeats|1994|p=vii}} So also did its location on the sea; John Yeats stated that "by marriage with a Pollexfen, we have given a tongue to the sea cliffs".&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Yeats, ''Autobiographies'' (1956), p. 12.  London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; The Butler Yeats family were highly artistic; his brother [[Jack Butler Yeats|Jack]] became an esteemed painter, while his sisters [[Elizabeth Yeats|Elizabeth]] and [[Lily Yeats|Susan Mary]]—known to family and friends as Lollie and Lily—became involved in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Bowe, Nicola. "Two Early Twentieth-Century Irish Arts and Crafts Workshops in Context". ''Journal of Design History'', Vol. 2, No. 2/3 (1989). 193–206&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeats was raised a member of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]], which was at the time undergoing a crisis of identity. While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage, and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]] observed that Napoleon's dictum that to understand the man you have to know what was happening in the world when he was twenty "is manifestly true of W.B.Y."&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; Yeats's childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and the [[home rule]] movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), p. xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, the family moved to England to aid their father, John, to further his career as an artist. At first the Yeats children were educated at home. Their mother entertained them with stories and Irish folktales. John provided an erratic education in geography and chemistry, and took William on natural history explorations of the nearby [[Slough]] countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), p, 24&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 January 1877, the young poet entered the [[Godolphin and Latymer School|Godolphin school]],&lt;ref&gt;Hone (1943), 28&lt;/ref&gt; which he attended for four years. He did not distinguish himself academically, and an early school report describes his performance as "only fair. Perhaps better in Latin than in any other subject. Very poor in spelling".&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Though he had difficulty with mathematics and languages (possibly because he was [[tone deafness|tone deaf]]&lt;ref&gt;Sessa, Anne Dzamba; ''Richard Wagner and the English''; p. 130. {{ISBN|0-8386-2055-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;), he was fascinated by biology and zoology. In 1879 the family moved to [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]] taking a two-year lease on 8 Woodstock Road.&lt;ref name=chiswick&gt;[http://www.chiswickw4.com/default.asp?section=info&amp;page=conyeats.htm Yeats in Bedford Park], chiswickw4.com&lt;/ref&gt; For financial reasons, the family returned to Dublin toward the end of 1880, living at first in the suburbs of [[Harold's Cross]]&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2003), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Howth]]. In October 1881, Yeats resumed his education at Dublin's [[The High School, Dublin|Erasmus Smith High School]].&lt;ref&gt;Hone (1943), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; His father's studio was nearby and William spent a great deal of time there, where he met many of the city's artists and writers. During this period he started writing poetry, and, in 1885, the ''Dublin University Review'' published Yeats's first poems, as well as an essay entitled "The Poetry of [[Samuel Ferguson|Sir Samuel Ferguson]]". Between 1884 and 1886, William attended the Metropolitan School of Art—now the [[National College of Art and Design]]—in [[Thomas Street, Dublin|Thomas Street]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit" /&gt; In March 1888 the family moved to 3 Blenheim Road in Bedford Park.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wnblog.co.uk/2013/04/the-attraction-of-bedford-park/ "The attraction of Bedford Park"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181019001450/https://www.wnblog.co.uk/2013/04/the-attraction-of-bedford-park/ |date=19 October 2018 }} by Amy Davies, 8 April 2013, [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]&lt;/ref&gt; The rent on the house was £50 a year.&lt;ref name=chiswick /&gt; 

He began writing his first works when he was seventeen; these included a poem—heavily influenced by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]—that describes a magician who set up a throne in central Asia. Other pieces from this period include a draft of a play about a bishop, a monk, and a woman accused of paganism by local shepherds, as well as love-poems and narrative lyrics on German knights. The early works were both conventional and, according to the critic Charles Johnston, "utterly unIrish", seeming to come out of a "vast murmurous gloom of dreams".&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Although Yeats's early works drew heavily on Shelley, [[Edmund Spenser]], and on the diction and colouring of [[pre-Raphaelite]] verse, he soon turned to [[Irish mythology|Irish mythology and folklore]] and the writings of [[William Blake]]. In later life, Yeats paid tribute to Blake by describing him as one of the "great artificers of God who uttered great truths to a little clan".&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Paulin|Paulin, Tom]]. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004. "[http://www.routledge.com/classics/features/blakepoems.html The Poems of William Blake]". Retrieved on 3 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, Yeats published ''John Sherman'' and "Dhoya", one a novella, the other a story.

The family returned to London in 1887. In March 1890 Yeats joined the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], and with [[Ernest Rhys]]&lt;ref&gt;Hone (1943), 83&lt;/ref&gt; co-founded the [[Rhymers' Club]], a group of London-based poets who met regularly in a Fleet Street tavern to recite their verse. Yeats later sought to mythologize the collective, calling it the "Tragic Generation" in his autobiography,&lt;ref&gt;Alford, Norman. "The Rhymers" Club: Poets of the Tragic Generation". ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'', Vol. 50, No. 4, March 1996, pp. 535–538&lt;/ref&gt; and published two anthologies of the Rhymers' work, the first one in 1892 and the second one in 1894. He collaborated with [[Edwin Ellis (poet)|Edwin Ellis]] on the first complete edition of William Blake's works, in the process rediscovering a forgotten poem, "Vala, or, the Four Zoas".&lt;ref&gt;Lancashire, Ian.

Yeats had a life-long interest in mysticism, [[spiritualism]], [[occultism]] and astrology. He read extensively on the subjects throughout his life, became a member of the [[paranormal]] research organisation "[[The Ghost Club]]" (in 1911) and was especially influenced by the writings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Martin J.

Retrieved on 15 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1892, he wrote: "If I had not made magic my constant study I could not have written a single word of my Blake book, nor would ''The Countess Kathleen'' ever have come to exist. The mystical life is the centre of all that I do and all that I think and all that I write."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Ellmann|Ellmann, Richard]] (1948). ''Yeats: The Man and the Masks''. (New York) Macmillan. 94&lt;/ref&gt; His mystical interests—also inspired by a study of Hinduism, under the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophist]] [[Mohini Mohun Chatterji|Mohini Chatterjee]], and the occult—formed much of the basis of his late poetry. Some critics disparaged this aspect of Yeats's work.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, Edward (ed.) [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7272.html "W. H. Auden"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610074844/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7272.html |date=10 June 2007 }}. ''The Complete Works of W.H. Auden: Prose, Vol. II, 1939–1948'', 2002. Retrieved on 26 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

His first significant poem was "The Island of Statues", a fantasy work that took [[Edmund Spenser]] and Shelley for its poetic models. The piece was serialized in the ''Dublin University Review''. Yeats wished to include it in his first collection, but it was deemed too long, and in fact was never republished in his lifetime. Quinx Books published the poem in complete form for the first time in 2014. His first solo publication was the pamphlet ''Mosada: A Dramatic Poem'' (1886), which comprised a print run of 100 copies paid for by his father. This was followed by the collection ''[[The Wanderings of Oisin]] and Other Poems'' (1889), which arranged a series of verse that dated as far back as the mid-1880s. The long title poem contains, in the words of his biographer [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]], "obscure Gaelic names, striking repetitions [and] an unremitting rhythm subtly varied as the poem proceeded through its three sections";&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), pp. 82–85&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;We rode in sorrow, with strong hounds three,
Bran, Sceolan, and Lomair,
On a morning misty and mild and fair.
The mist-drops hung on the fragrant trees,
And in the blossoms hung the bees.
We rode in sadness above Lough Lean,
For our best were dead on Gavra's green.&lt;/poem&gt;

"The Wanderings of Oisin" is based on the lyrics of the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]] and displays the influence of both Sir Samuel Ferguson and the Pre-Raphaelite poets.&lt;ref&gt;Alspach, Russell K. "The Use by Yeats and Other Irish Writers of the Folklore of Patrick Kennedy". ''The Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 59, No. 234, December 1946, pp. 404–412&lt;/ref&gt; The poem took two years to complete and was one of the few works from this period that he did not disown in his maturity. ''Oisin'' introduces what was to become one of his most important themes: the appeal of the life of contemplation over the appeal of the life of action. Following the work, Yeats never again attempted another long poem. His other early poems, which are meditations on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects, include ''Poems'' (1895), ''The Secret Rose'' (1897), and ''The Wind Among the Reeds'' (1899). The covers of these volumes were illustrated by Yeats's friend [[Althea Gyles]].&lt;ref name="Gould ONB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gould|first1=Warwick|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59193|access-date=1 August 2015|chapter=Gyles, Margaret Alethea (1868–1949)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1885, Yeats was involved in the formation of the Dublin Hermetic Order. The society held its first meeting on 16 June, with Yeats acting as its chairman. The same year, the Dublin Theosophical lodge was opened in conjunction with Brahmin [[Mohini Mohun Chatterji|Mohini Chatterjee]], who travelled from the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical Society]] in London to lecture. Yeats attended his first [[séance]] the following year. He later became heavily involved with the Theosophy and with [[hermeticism]], particularly with the eclectic [[Rosicrucianism]] of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. During séances held from 1912, a spirit calling itself "Leo Africanus" apparently claimed it was Yeats's ''[[Daemon (mythology)|Daemon]]'' or anti-self, inspiring some of the speculations in ''Per Amica Silentia Lunae''.&lt;ref&gt;Nally, Claire V. "National Identity Formation in W. B. Yeats' ''A Vision''". ''Irish Studies Review'', Vol. 14, No. 1, February 2006, pp. 57–67&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted into the Golden Dawn in March 1890 and took the [[magical motto]] ''{{lang|la|Daemon est Deus inversus}}''—translated as 'Devil is God inverted'.{{efn|''{{lang|la|Daemon est Deus inversus}}'' is taken from the writings of [[Madame Blavatsky]] in which she claimed that "...&amp;nbsp;even that divine Homogeneity must contain in itself the essence of both good and evil", and uses the motto as a symbol of the [[Plane (esotericism)|astral plane's]] light.}} He was an active recruiter for the sect's [[Isis-Urania Temple]], and brought in his uncle George Pollexfen, [[Maud Gonne]], and [[Florence Farr]]. Although he reserved a distaste for abstract and dogmatic religions founded around personality cults, he was attracted to the type of people he met at the Golden Dawn.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in the Order's power struggles, both with Farr and [[Macgregor Mathers]], and was involved when Mathers sent [[Aleister Crowley]] to repossess Golden Dawn paraphernalia during the "Battle of Blythe Road". After the Golden Dawn ceased and splintered into various offshoots, Yeats remained with the [[Stella Matutina]] until 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Cullingford, Elizabeth.

[[File:WB Yeats nd.jpg|thumb|upright|W. B. Yeats (no date)]]
In 1889, Yeats met Maud Gonne, a 23-year-old English heiress and ardent Irish Nationalist.{{efn|Gonne claimed they first met in London three years earlier. Foster notes how Gonne was "notoriously unreliable on dates and places (1997, p. 57).}} She was eighteen months younger than Yeats and later claimed she met the poet as a "paint-stained art student."&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Gonne admired "The Island of Statues" and sought out his acquaintance. Yeats began an obsessive infatuation, and she had a significant and lasting effect on his poetry and his life thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Uddin Khan, Jalal. "Yeats and Maud Gonne: (Auto)biographical and Artistic Intersection". ''Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years he admitted, "it seems to me that she [Gonne] brought into my life those days—for as yet I saw only what lay upon the surface—the middle of the tint, a sound as of a Burmese gong, an over-powering tumult that had yet many pleasant secondary notes."&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; Yeats's love was unrequited, in part due to his reluctance to participate in her nationalist activism.&lt;ref name="bbc4"&gt;"William Butler Yeats". [[BBC Four]].{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/audiointerviews/profilepages/yeatsw2.shtml |title=William Butler Yeats 1865–1939 |access-date=20 June 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205152608/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/audiointerviews/profilepages/yeatsw2.shtml |archive-date=5 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 he visited Gonne in Ireland and proposed marriage, but was rejected. He later admitted that from that point "the troubling of my life began".&lt;ref name="Cahill"&gt;Cahill, Christopher. "Second Puberty: The Later Years of W. B. Yeats Brought His Best Poetry, along with Personal Melodrama on an Epic Scale". ''The Atlantic Monthly'', December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Yeats proposed to Gonne three more times: in 1899, 1900 and 1901. She refused each proposal, and in 1903, to his dismay, married the Irish nationalist [[John MacBride|Major John MacBride]].&lt;ref name="Ó Corráin"&gt;Ó Corráin, Donnchadh. "[http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/William_Butler_Yeats William Butler Yeats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702225549/http://multitext.ucc.ie/d/William_Butler_Yeats |date=2 July 2007 }}". [[University College Cork]]. Retrieved on 15 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His only other love affair during this period was with [[Olivia Shakespear]], whom he first met in 1894, and parted from in 1897.

Yeats derided MacBride in letters and in poetry. He was horrified by Gonne's marriage, at losing his muse to another man; in addition, her conversion to Catholicism before marriage offended him; Yeats was Protestant/agnostic. He worried his muse would come under the influence of the priests and do their bidding.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2003), pp. 139–153; Jordan (1997), pp. 83–88&lt;/ref&gt;

Gonne's marriage to MacBride was a disaster. This pleased Yeats, as Gonne began to visit him in London. After the birth of her son, [[Seán MacBride]], in 1904, Gonne and MacBride agreed to end the marriage, although they were unable to agree on the child's welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main 'second', though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted, with Gonne having custody of the baby and MacBride having visiting rights.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2000), pp. 13–141&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Main-image.jpg|right|upright|thumb|William Butler Yeats, Charcoal drawing by [[John Singer Sargent]],1908]] Yeats's friendship with Gonne ended, yet, in Paris in 1908, they finally consummated their relationship. "The long years of fidelity rewarded at last" was how another of his lovers described the event. Yeats was less sentimental and later remarked that "the tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul."&lt;ref name="Cahill" /&gt; The relationship did not develop into a new phase after their night together, and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to the poet indicating that despite the physical consummation, they could not continue as they had been: "I have prayed so hard to have all earthly desire taken from my love for you and dearest, loving you as I do, I have prayed and I am praying still that the bodily desire for me may be taken from you too."&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1909, Gonne was sending Yeats letters praising the advantage given to artists who abstain from sex. Nearly twenty years later, Yeats recalled the night with Gonne in his poem "A Man Young and Old":&lt;ref&gt;Malins; Purkis (1994), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;My arms are like the twisted thorn
And yet there beauty lay;
The first of all the tribe lay there
And did such pleasure take;
She who had brought great [[Hector]] down
And put all Troy to wreck.&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1896, Yeats was introduced to [[Lady Gregory]] by their mutual friend [[Edward Martyn]]. Gregory encouraged Yeats's nationalism, and convinced him to continue focusing on writing drama. Although he was influenced by French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], Yeats concentrated on an identifiably Irish content and this inclination was reinforced by his involvement with a new generation of younger and emerging Irish authors. Together with Lady Gregory, Martyn, and other writers including [[John Millington Synge|J. M. Synge]], [[Seán O'Casey]], and [[Padraic Colum]], Yeats was one of those responsible for the establishment of the "[[Irish Literary Revival]]" movement.&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran, Neil. ''After Yeats and Joyce: Reading Modern Irish Literature''. Oxford University Press, 1997, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these creative writers, much of the impetus for the Revival came from the work of scholarly translators who were aiding in the discovery of both the ancient sagas and Ossianic poetry and the more recent folk song tradition in Irish. One of the most significant of these was [[Douglas Hyde]], later the first President of Ireland, whose ''Love Songs of Connacht'' was widely admired.

In 1899, Yeats, Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] began the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] to present Irish plays.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (2003), pp. 486, 662&lt;/ref&gt; The ideals of the Abbey were derived from the avant-garde French theatre, which sought to express the "ascendancy of the playwright rather than the actor-manager ''à l'anglais''."&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Text reproduced from Yeats's own handwritten draft.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's manifesto, which Yeats wrote, declared, "We hope to find in Ireland an uncorrupted &amp; imaginative audience trained to listen by its passion for oratory&amp;nbsp;... &amp; that freedom to experiment which is not found in the theatres of England, &amp; without which no new movement in art or literature can succeed."&lt;ref&gt;Foster (1997), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective survived for about two years but was not successful. Working with two Irish brothers with theatrical experience, [[William Fay|William]] and [[Frank Fay (Irish actor)|Frank Fay]], Yeats's unpaid yet independently wealthy secretary [[Annie Horniman]], and the leading [[West End theatre|West End]] actress [[Florence Farr]], the group established the [[Irish National Theatre Society]]. Along with Synge, they acquired property in Dublin and on 27 December 1904 opened the [[Abbey Theatre]]. Yeats's play ''[[Cathleen ni Houlihan (play)|Cathleen ni Houlihan]]'' and Lady Gregory's ''Spreading the News'' were featured on the opening night. Yeats remained involved with the Abbey until his death, both as a member of the board and a prolific playwright. In 1902, he helped set up the [[Dun Emer Press]] to publish work by writers associated with the Revival. This became the [[Cuala Press]] in 1904, and inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement, sought to "find work for Irish hands in the making of beautiful things."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcd.ie/Secretary/Communications/Press_Releases/PR0203/PRirishgenius.htm "Irish Genius: The Yeats Family and The Cuala Press"]. [[Trinity College Dublin]], 12 February 2004. Retrieved on 2 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; From then until its closure in 1946, the press—which was run by the poet's sisters—produced over 70 titles; 48 of them books by Yeats himself.

Yeats met the American poet [[Ezra Pound]] in 1909. Pound had travelled to London at least partly to meet the older man, whom he considered "the only poet worthy of serious study."&lt;ref&gt;Monroe, Harriet (1913). "Poetry". (Chicago) Modern Poetry Association. 123&lt;/ref&gt; From that year until 1916, the two men wintered in the Stone Cottage at [[Ashdown Forest]], with Pound nominally acting as Yeats's secretary. The relationship got off to a rocky start when Pound arranged for the publication in the magazine ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' of some of Yeats's verse with Pound's own unauthorised alterations. These changes reflected Pound's distaste for Victorian prosody. A more indirect influence was the scholarship on Japanese [[Noh]] plays that Pound had obtained from [[Ernest Fenollosa]]'s widow, which provided Yeats with a model for the aristocratic drama he intended to write. The first of his plays modelled on Noh was ''At the Hawk's Well'', the first draft of which he dictated to Pound in January 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Sands, Maren.

The emergence of a nationalist revolutionary movement from the ranks of the mostly Roman Catholic lower-middle and working class made Yeats reassess some of his attitudes. In the refrain of "[[Easter, 1916]]" ("All changed, changed utterly / A terrible beauty is born"), Yeats faces his own failure to recognise the merits of the leaders of the [[Easter Rising]], due to his attitude towards their ordinary backgrounds and lives.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (2003), pp. 59–66&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeats was close to Lady Gregory and her home place of Coole Park, Co, Galway. He would often visit and stay there as it was a central meeting place for people who supported the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions. His poem, "[[The Wild Swans at Coole (poem)|The Wild Swans at Coole]]" was written there, between 1916 and 1917.

He wrote prefaces for two books of Irish mythological tales, compiled by [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]]: ''[[Cuchulain of Muirthemne]]'' (1902), and ''[[Gods and Fighting Men]]'' (1904). In the preface of the later he wrote: "One must not expect in these stories the epic lineaments, the many incidents, woven into one great event of, let us say the War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne, or that of the last gathering at Muirthemne."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Gods and Fighting Men: The Story of the Tuatha de Danann and of the Fianna of Ireland |first= Augusta |last= Lady Gregory |authorlink= Augusta, Lady Gregory |year= 1904 |url= https://archive.org/details/godsfightingmens00gregrich | page = xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
Yeats was an [[Irish Nationalist]], who sought a kind of traditional lifestyle articulated through poems such as 'The Fisherman'. However, as his life progressed, he sheltered much of his revolutionary spirit and distanced himself from the [[Irish War of Independence|intense political landscape]] until [[Irish Civil War|1922]], when he was appointed Senator for the [[Irish Free State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanford|first1=John|title=Roy Foster: Yeats emerged as poet of Irish Revolution, despite past political beliefs|url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/april18/foster-418.html|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=18 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oireachtas_db&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;HouseNum=1922&amp;MemberID=1725&amp;ConstID=77|title=Mr. William Butler Yeats|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earlier part of his life, Yeats was a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;Sternlicht, Sanford V. ''A Reader's Guide to Modern Irish Drama'', Syracuse University Press, 1998, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the escalating tension of the political scene, Yeats distanced himself from the core political activism in the midst of the [[Easter Rising]], even holding back his poetry inspired by the events until 1920.

In the 1930s Yeats was fascinated with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, nationalist movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the far right [[Blueshirts]], although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism, and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order and the needs of the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order.&lt;ref&gt;Nally, Claire. 2010. ''Envisioning Ireland: W. B. Yeats's Occult Nationalism''. Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt; After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland, he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views, but maintained a preference for authoritarian and nationalist leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Jonathan (ed.). 1996.

=== Marriage to Georgie Hyde Lees===
{{main|Georgie Hyde-Lees}}

By 1916, Yeats was 51 years old and determined to marry and produce an heir. His rival John MacBride had been executed for his role in the 1916 [[Easter Rising]], so Yeats hoped that his widow might remarry.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2003), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; His final proposal to Maud Gonne took place in mid-1916.&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;Mann, Neil. [http://www.yeatsvision.com/Overview.html "An Overview of ''A Vision''"]. ''The System of W. B. Yeats's ''A Vision''&lt;nowiki /&gt;''. Retrieved on 15 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Gonne's history of revolutionary political activism, as well as a series of personal catastrophes in the previous few years of her life—including [[chloroform]] addiction and her troubled marriage to MacBride—made her a potentially unsuitable wife;&lt;ref name="Cahill" /&gt; biographer R. F. Foster has observed that Yeats's last offer was motivated more by a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her.

Yeats proposed in an indifferent manner, with conditions attached, and he both expected and hoped she would turn him down. According to Foster "when he duly asked Maud to marry him, and was duly refused, his thoughts shifted with surprising speed to her daughter." [[Iseult Gonne]] was Maud's second child with [[Lucien Millevoye]], and at the time was twenty-one years old. She had lived a sad life to this point; conceived as an attempt to reincarnate her short-lived brother, for the first few years of her life she was presented as her mother's adopted niece. When Maud told her that she was going to marry, Iseult cried and told her mother that she hated MacBride.&lt;ref&gt;Gonne MacBride, Maud. ''A Servant of the Queen''. Gollanz, 1938 pp. 287–289&lt;/ref&gt; When Gonne took action to divorce MacBride in 1905, the court heard allegations that he had sexually assaulted Iseult, then eleven. At fifteen, she proposed to Yeats. In 1917, he proposed to Iseult, but was rejected.

That September, Yeats proposed to 25-year-old [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]] (1892–1968), known as George, whom he had met through Olivia Shakespear. Despite warnings from her friends—"George&amp;nbsp;... you can't. He must be dead"—Hyde-Lees accepted, and the two were married on 20 October.&lt;ref name="Cahill" /&gt; Their marriage was a success, in spite of the age difference, and in spite of Yeats's feelings of remorse and regret during their honeymoon. The couple went on to have two children, [[Anne Yeats|Anne]] and [[Michael Yeats|Michael]]. Although in later years he had romantic relationships with other women, Georgie herself wrote to her husband "When you are dead, people will talk about your love affairs, but I shall say nothing, for I will remember how proud you were."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Terence. ''The Life of W. B. Yeats: A Critical Biography". Wiley-Blackwell, 2001, p. 347. {{ISBN|0-631-22851-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first years of marriage, they experimented with [[automatic writing]]; she contacted a variety of spirits and guides they called "Instructors" while in a trance. The spirits communicated a complex and esoteric system of philosophy and history, which the couple developed into an exposition using geometrical shapes: phases, cones, and gyres.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (2003), pp. 105, 383&lt;/ref&gt; Yeats devoted much time to preparing this material for publication as ''[[A Vision]]'' (1925). In 1924, he wrote to his publisher T. Werner Laurie, admitting: "I dare say I delude myself in thinking this book my book of books".&lt;ref name="Mann2"&gt;Mann, Neil.

=== Nobel Prize ===
[[File:Yeats1923.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Yeats photographed in 1923]]
In December 1923, Yeats was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], "for his always inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobel Prize in Literature 1923|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1923/|website=NobelPrize.org|access-date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was aware of the symbolic value of an Irish winner so soon after Ireland had gained independence, and sought to highlight the fact at each available opportunity. His reply to many of the letters of congratulations sent to him contained the words: "I consider that this honour has come to me less as an individual than as a representative of Irish literature, it is part of Europe's welcome to the Free State."&lt;ref&gt;Foster (2003), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeats used the occasion of his acceptance lecture at the [[Swedish Academy|Royal Academy of Sweden]] to present himself as a standard-bearer of Irish nationalism and Irish cultural independence. As he remarked, "The theatres of Dublin were empty buildings hired by the English traveling companies, and we wanted Irish plays and Irish players. When we thought of these plays we thought of everything that was romantic and poetical, because the nationalism we had called up—the nationalism every generation had called up in moments of discouragement—was romantic and poetical."&lt;ref name="Moses"&gt;Moses, Michael Valdez. "[http://reason.com/archives/2001/02/01/the-poet-as-politician The Poet As Politician]". ''Reason'', February 2001. Retrieved on 3 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The prize led to a significant increase in the sales of his books, as his publishers [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] sought to capitalise on the publicity. For the first time he had money, and he was able to repay not only his own debts, but those of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (2003), pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Old age and death ===
By early 1925, Yeats's health had stabilised, and he had completed most of the writing for ''[[A Vision]]'' (dated 1925, it actually appeared in January 1926, when he almost immediately started rewriting it for a second version). He had been appointed to the first [[Seanad Éireann|Irish Senate]] in 1922, and was re-appointed for a second term in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (2003), pp. 228–239&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his tenure, a debate on divorce arose, and Yeats viewed the issue as primarily a confrontation between the emerging Roman Catholic ethos and the Protestant minority.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (2003), p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;  When the Roman Catholic Church weighed in with a blanket refusal to consider their anti position, ''[[The Irish Times]]'' countered that a measure to outlaw divorce would alienate Protestants and "crystallise" the [[partition of Ireland]].

In response, Yeats delivered a series of speeches that attacked the "quixotically impressive" ambitions of the government and clergy, likening their campaign tactics to those of "medieval Spain."&lt;ref name="Foster294"&gt;Foster (2003), p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; "Marriage is not to us a Sacrament, but, upon the other hand, the love of a man and woman, and the inseparable physical desire, are sacred. This conviction has come to us through ancient philosophy and modern literature, and it seems to us a most sacrilegious thing to persuade two people who hate each other... to live together, and it is to us no remedy to permit them to part if neither can re-marry."&lt;ref name= "Foster294" /&gt; The resulting debate has been described as one of Yeats's "supreme public moments", and began his ideological move away from [[pluralism (political philosophy) |pluralism]] towards religious confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (2003), p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

His language became more forceful; the Jesuit Father Peter Finlay was described by Yeats as a man of "monstrous discourtesy", and he lamented that, "It is one of the glories of the Church in which I was born that we have put our Bishops in their place in discussions requiring legislation".&lt;ref name="Foster294" /&gt; During his time in the Senate, Yeats further warned his colleagues: "If you show that this country, southern Ireland, is going to be governed by Roman Catholic ideas and by Catholic ideas alone, you will never get the [[Northern Ireland|North]]... You will put a wedge in the midst of this nation".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0005/S.0005.192506110009.html "Seanad Resumes: Debate on Divorce Legislation Resumed"] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606105953/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0005/S.0005.192506110009.html |date=6 June 2011}}".

In 1924, he chaired a coinage committee charged with selecting a set of designs for the first currency of the [[Irish Free State]]. Aware of the symbolic power latent in the imagery of a young state's currency, he sought a form that was "elegant, racy of the soil, and utterly unpolitical".&lt;ref name="Foster333"&gt;Foster (2003), p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; When the house finally decided on the artwork of [[Percy Metcalfe]], Yeats was pleased, though he regretted that compromise had led to "lost muscular tension" in the finally depicted images.&lt;ref name= "Foster333" /&gt; He retired from the Senate in 1928 because of ill health.

Towards the end of his life—and especially after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and [[Great Depression]], which led some to question whether democracy could cope with deep economic difficulty—Yeats seems to have returned to his aristocratic sympathies. During the aftermath of the First World War, he became sceptical about the efficacy of democratic government, and anticipated political reconstruction in Europe through totalitarian rule.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (2003), p. 468&lt;/ref&gt; His later association with Pound drew him towards [[Benito Mussolini]], for whom he expressed admiration on a number of occasions.&lt;ref name="Moses" /&gt; He wrote three "marching songs"—never used—for the Irish General [[Eoin O'Duffy]]'s [[Blueshirts]].

At the age of 69 he was 'rejuvenated' by the [[Eugen Steinach|Steinach operation]] which was performed on 6 April 1934 by [[Norman Haire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Wyndham |first1=Diana |last2=Kirby |first2=Michael|title=Norman Haire and the Study of Sex|date=2012|publisher=Sydney University Press|isbn=978-1-74332-006-8|at=Foreword, and pp. 249–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the last five years of his life Yeats found a new vigour evident from both his poetry and his intimate relations with younger women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nli.ie/yeats/main.html "The Life and Works of William Butler Yeats"].

In a letter of 1935, Yeats noted: "I find my present weakness made worse by the strange second puberty the operation has given me, the ferment that has come upon my imagination. If I write poetry it will be unlike anything I have done".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Dorothy Wellesley, 17 June 1935; cited [[Richard Ellmann|Ellmann]], "Yeats's Second Puberty", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 9 May 1985&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, he undertook editorship of the ''[[Oxford Book of Modern Verse 1892–1935|Oxford Book of Modern Verse, 1892–1935]]''.&lt;ref name="Ó Corráin" /&gt;

Attempts had been made at Roquebrune to dissuade the family from proceeding with the removal of the remains to Ireland due to the uncertainty of their identity. His body had earlier been exhumed and transferred to the [[ossuary]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2003), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Yeats and George had often discussed his death, and his express wish was that he be buried quickly in France with a minimum of fuss. According to George, "His actual words were 'If I die bury me up there [at Roquebrune] and then in a year's time when the newspapers have forgotten me, dig me up and plant me in Sligo'."&lt;ref&gt;Foster (2003), p. 651&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1948, Yeats's body was moved to the churchyard of [[St Columba's Church, Drumcliff|St Columba's Church]], [[Drumcliff]], County Sligo, on the Irish Naval Service [[Flower-class corvette|corvette]] [[LÉ Macha (01) |''LÉ Macha'']].&lt;ref&gt;Foster (2003), p. 656.&lt;/ref&gt;  The person in charge of this operation for the Irish Government was [[Seán MacBride]], son of Maud Gonne MacBride, and then [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister of External Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan (2003), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; His epitaph is taken from the last lines of "[[Under Ben Bulben]]",&lt;ref&gt;Allen, James Lovic.

French ambassador [[Stanislas Ostroróg]] was involved in returning the remains of the Irish poet from France to Ireland in 1948; in a letter to the European director of the Foreign Ministry in Paris "Ostrorog tells how Yeats’s son Michael sought official help in locating the poet’s remains.  Neither Michael Yeats nor Sean MacBride, the Irish foreign minister who organised the ceremony, wanted to know the details of how the remains were collected, Ostrorog notes.  He repeatedly urges caution and discretion and says the Irish ambassador in Paris should not be informed." Yeats' body was exhumed in 1946 and the remains were moved to on ossuary and mixed with other remains. The French Foreign Ministry authorized Ostrorog to secretly cover the cost of repatriation from his slush fund. Authorities were worried about the fact that the much-loved poet's remains were thrown into a communal grave, causing embarrassment for both Ireland and France. "Mr Rebouillat, (a) forensic doctor in Roquebrune would be able to reconstitute a skeleton presenting all the characteristics of the deceased." per a letter from Ostroróg to his superiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Documents |url= https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/wb-yeats-at-150/documents |work=The Irish Times | access-date= 8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeats is generally considered one of the twentieth century key English language poets. He was a [[Symbolist]] poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract thoughts that may seem more significant and resonant. His use of symbols&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Ulanov|Ulanov, Barry]]. ''Makers of the Modern Theater''. McGraw-Hill, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Gale Research International.

Unlike other [[modernism|modernists]] who experimented with [[free verse]], Yeats was a master of the traditional forms.&lt;ref&gt;Finneran, Richard. ''Yeats: An Annual of Critical and Textual Studies 1995''. University of Michigan Press, 1997. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of modernism on his work can be seen in the increasing abandonment of the more conventionally poetic diction of his early work in favour of the more austere language and more direct approach to his themes that increasingly characterises the poetry and plays of his middle period, comprising the volumes ''In the Seven Woods'', ''Responsibilities'' and ''The Green Helmet''.&lt;ref&gt;Logenbach, James. ''Stone Cottage: Pound, Yeats, and Modernism''. Oxford University Press, 1988, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; His later poetry and plays are written in a more personal vein, and the works written in the last twenty years of his life include mention of his son and daughter,&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Vereen. ''Yeats and the logic of formalism''. University of Missouri Press, 2006. 132&lt;/ref&gt; as well as meditations on the experience of growing old.&lt;ref&gt;Seiden, Morton. ''William Butler Yeats''. Michigan State University Press, 1962, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; In his poem, "[[The Circus Animals' Desertion]]", he describes the inspiration for these late works:
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;Now that my ladder's gone
I must lie down where all the ladders start
In the foul [[rag and bone]] shop of the heart.{{sfnp|O'Neill|2003|p=6}}&lt;/poem&gt;

During 1929, he stayed at [[Thoor Ballylee]] near [[Gort]] in [[County Galway]] (where Yeats had his summer home since 1919) for the last time. Much of the remainder of his life was lived outside Ireland, although he did lease [[Riversdale]] house in the Dublin suburb of [[Rathfarnham]] in 1932. He wrote prolifically through his final years, and published poetry, plays, and prose. In 1938, he attended the Abbey for the final time to see the premiere of his play ''[[Purgatory (drama)|Purgatory]]''. His ''Autobiographies of William Butler Yeats'' was published that same year.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Wallace. Review of "Tragic Knowledge: Yeats' "Autobiography" and Hermeneutics" by Daniel T. O'Hara.

While Yeats's early poetry drew heavily on [[Irish mythology|Irish myth and folklore]], his later work was engaged with more contemporary issues, and his style underwent a dramatic transformation. His work can be divided into three general periods. The early poems are lushly pre-Raphaelite in tone, self-consciously ornate, and, at times, according to unsympathetic critics, stilted. Yeats began by writing epic poems such as ''The Isle of Statues'' and ''[[The Wanderings of Oisin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Howes, Marjorie. ''Yeats's nations: gender, class, and Irishness''. Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 28–31&lt;/ref&gt; His other early poems are lyrics on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects. Yeats's middle period saw him abandon the pre-Raphaelite character of his early work&lt;ref&gt;Seiden, 153&lt;/ref&gt; and attempt to turn himself into a [[Walter Savage Landor|Landor]]-style social ironist.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold. ''Yeats''. Oxford University Press, 1972, p. 168 {{ISBN|0-19-501603-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics who admire his middle work might characterize it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system he began to work out for himself under the influence of [[spiritualism]]. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of ''The Wanderings of Oisin'', is reproduced in ''A Dialogue Between Self and Soul''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kathleen Raine|Raine, Kathleen]]. ''Yeats the Initiate''. New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1990, pp. 327–329. {{ISBN|0-389-20951-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics claim that Yeats spanned the transition from the nineteenth century into twentieth-century modernism in poetry much as [[Pablo Picasso]] did in painting while others question whether late Yeats has much in common with modernists of the [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] variety.&lt;ref&gt;Holdeman, David. ''The Cambridge Introduction to W. B. Yeats''. Cambridge University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|9780521547376}}, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernists read the well-known poem "[[The Second Coming (poem)|The Second Coming]]" as a dirge for the decline of European civilisation, but it also expresses Yeats's apocalyptic mystical theories, and is shaped by the 1890s. His most important collections of poetry started with ''The Green Helmet'' (1910) and ''Responsibilities'' (1914). In imagery, Yeats's poetry became sparer and more powerful as he grew older. ''The Tower'' (1928), ''The Winding Stair'' (1933), and ''New Poems'' (1938) contained some of the most potent images in twentieth-century poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Spanos, William. ″Sacramental Imagery in the Middle and Late Poetry of W. B. Yeats.″ ''Texas Studies in Literature and Language.'' (1962) Vol. 4, No. 2. pp. 214-228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeats's mystical inclinations, informed by Hinduism, [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] beliefs and the [[occult]], provided much of the basis of his late poetry,&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz, Dagmar C. G. ''Transforming the Center, Eroding the Margins''. University of Rochester Press, 2004, p. 282. {{ISBN|1-58046-175-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some critics have judged as lacking in intellectual credibility. The metaphysics of Yeats's late works must be read in relation to his system of esoteric fundamentals in ''[[A Vision]]'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Grosvenor E. "Yeats's Second ''Vision'': Berkeley, Coleridge, and the Correspondence with Sturge Moore". ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 76, No. 2, April 1981, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Yeats is commemorated in Sligo town by a statue, created in 1989 by sculptor Ronan Gillespie. It was erected outside the [[Ulster Bank]], at the corner of Stephen Street and Markievicz Road, on the 50th anniversary of the poet’s death. Yeats had remarked, on receiving his Nobel Prize that the [[Stockholm Palace|Royal Palace in Stockholm]] "resembled the Ulster Bank in Sligo". Across the river is the Yeats Memorial Building, home to the Sligo Yeats Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atriptoireland.com/2014/07/08/sligo-w-b-yeats-statue/|title=Sligo: W.B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2769">[[File:Henry III (HRE).jpg|thumb|Wipo wrote ''Tetralogus Heinrici'', a eulogy of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry III]] (depicted)]]
'''Wipo of Burgundy''' (also '''Wippo'''; c. 995 – c. 1048) was a priest and writer. He was a [[chaplain]] to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]],&lt;ref&gt;''Imperial Lives and Letters of the Eleventh Century'', transl. Theodor Ernst Mommsen, Karl F. Morrison, ed. Robert L. Benson, (Columbia University Press, 2000), 42.&lt;/ref&gt; whose biography he wrote in chronicle form, ''Gesta Chuonradi II imperatoris''. Present at the election of Conrad II, he most likely followed the emperor on his campaigns into [[Burgundy]] (1033) and against the [[Slavs]] (1035), both of which he wrote with extensive clarity.&lt;ref&gt;''Imperial Lives and Letters of the Eleventh Century'', transl. Theodor Ernst Mommsen, Karl F. Morrison, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

He presented his work to Conrad’s son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] in 1046, not long after Henry was crowned. In this Wipo fully understands his subject, is fresh and animated, and, although affectionate, is not a mere eulogist or a flatterer, for he sees Conrad’s failings clearly. But he does not fully grasp the general conditions of the age, especially the emperor’s manifold relations to the ruling princes and the Church. His style is simple and fluent, and his language well-chosen.

He mentioned Henry’s [[Matilda of Franconia|younger sister Matilda]] as a fiancée of King [[Henry I of France]] and records her death and burial at [[Worms, Germany]] in 1034.

Among his other extant writings are the maxims, ''Proverbia'' (1027 or 1028), and ''Tetralogus Heinrici'' in [[rhyme]]d [[hexameter]]s. Presented to Henry in 1041, it is a eulogy of the emperor mixed with earnest exhortations, emphasizing that right and law are the real foundations of the throne. He wrote a [[lament]] in Latin on Conrad’s death, and is believed to have written the famous [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]] for [[Easter]], ''[[Victimae paschali laudes]]'' (though the attribution of this chant to Wipo is uncertain&lt;ref name=Crocker&gt;Richard L. Crocker, "Wipo (Wigbert)" Grove Music Online, 2006, accessed 2006-09-26.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Women were professionally active in the academic discipline of [[art history]] already in the nineteenth century and participated in the important shift early in the century that began involving an "emphatically corporeal visual subject", with [[Vernon Lee]] as a notable example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Hilary|date=1998–1999|title=Women and the Ends of Art History: Vision and Corporeality in Nineteenth-Century Critical Discourse|journal=[[Victorian Studies]]|volume=42|issue=1|pages=77–100|jstor=3829127|doi=10.2979/vic.1998.42.1.77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that in the twentieth century women art historians (and curators), by choosing to study women artists, "dramatically" "increased their visibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tannenbaum|first=Judith|authorlink=Judith Tannenbaum|year=1994|title=East Coast- C Is for Contemporary Art Curator: Curiosity, Contradiction, Collaboration, Challenge|journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]|volume=53|issue=3|pages=47, 49, 51, 53 55, 57, 59|jstor=777431|doi=10.2307/777431}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, women art historians are one of two groups (besides authors of high-school texbooks) "who say there have been great women artists" in the first place, according to the authors of a study of the representations of women artists in US textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Roger|author2=Ashley Folgo |year=2006|title=Who Says There Have Been Great Women Artists? Some Afterthoughts|journal=[[Art Education (journal)|Art Education]]|volume=59|issue=2|pages=47–52|jstor=27696136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and employment==
&lt;!--Obviously this needs to be a historical narrative, not just a single note--but hey, that's all I got right now--&gt;In the United States professional, academic employment for women art historians was, by the early 1970s, not commensurate with the number of female PhDs in art history. Between 1960 and 1969, 30.1% of PhDs were awarded to women but those numbers increased significantly during that period: between 1960 and 1965 it was 27%, but between 1966 and 1967 it had gone up to 43.5%. But in 1970-1971, women art historians in art departments in the US made up 23.1% of instructors, 21.6% of assistant professors, 17.5% of associate professors, and only 11.1% of full professors. Comparison with the numbers for the same years for women in the languages, from a study done by the [[Modern Language Association]], showed that "women in C.A.A. [College Art Association] professions face[d] rather more severe discrimination than women in M.L.A. fields". Similar tendencies were reported for salary and employment in studio teaching ("preliminary statistics...indicate that women artists receive a disproportionately small share of full-time studio jobs") and in museums ("particularly significant was a tendency to hire women with BAs to be secretaries and men with BAs for trainee programs which rapidly advanced them to more challenging positions).&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

The history of women in the profession also suggests that art education itself has benefited from the increased presence of professional women art historians, since women students sometimes found it necessary to "redo" an education in which only a male point of view had been provided given. [[Paula Harper]], "one of the first art historians to bring a feminist perspective to the study of painting and sculpture",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/arts/design/paula-hays-harper-feminist-art-historian-dies-at-81.html?_r=0|title=Paula Hays Harper, Art Historian, Is Dead at 81|last=Grady|first=Denise|date=25 June 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Moira Roth shared the same experience of a "one-sided training", of feeling left out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harper|first=Paula|year=1985|title=The First Feminist Art Program: A View from the 1980s|journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]|volume=10|issue=4|pages=762–81|jstor=3174313|doi=10.1086/494182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination against "women in college and university art departments and art museums" was, in the early 1970s, the immediate cause for the foundation of the [[Women's Caucus for Art]] (see below).&lt;ref name=harris&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Ann Sutherland|year=1973|title=Women in College Art Departments and Museums|journal=[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]|volume=32|issue=4|pages=417–19|jstor=775692|doi=10.2307/775692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statistical study of US employment among art faculties published in 1977, Sandra Packard notes that "in art departments women have been decreasing in number since the 1930's", and that the number of women in art faculties at institutes of higher education "decreas[ed] from 22% in 1963 to a low of 19.5% in 1974", and cites statistics suggesting that "although women are concentrated at the lower ranks in art faculties, they have more Ph.D. degrees than their male colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Analysis of Current Statistics and Trends as They Influence the Status and Future for Women in the Art Academe|first=Sandra|last=Packard|journal=[[Studies in Art Education]]|volume=18|issue=2|year=1977|pages=38–48|jstor=1319477|doi=10.2307/1319477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation==
The [[Women's Caucus for Art]] (WCA), a caucus for woman art historians, artists, and curators was founded at the 1972 meeting of the [[College Art Association]] (CAA), but re-established itself as an independent organization in 1974 after the CAA told them they could not use the CAA name anymore. According to Judith Brodsky, the CAA was, at the time, very much a male-dominated organization; she notes, though, in a 1977 article that the Caucus is given space and time at the annual CAA conference and in the CAA's journal, ''Art Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brodsky|first=Judith K.|year=1977|title=The Women's Caucus for Art|journal=[[Women's Studies Newsletter]]|volume=5|issue=1/2|pages=13–15|jstor=40042430}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Women's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] was installed in 1979. The organization's objectives include "providing women with leadership opportunities and professional development" and "expanding networking and exhibition opportunities for women", and to that purpose publishes a newsletter, organizes sessions at conferences, and runs databases for "art and activism". In 2012 the WCA celebrated its 40th anniversary, and published a pamphlet for the annual awards ceremony that also includes a number of historical essays and reflections from the past presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalwca.org/LTA/LTA2012.pdf|accessdate=25 May 2014|publisher=Women's Caucus for Art|title=Women's Caucus for Art: 40th Anniversary Celebration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women art historians and feminist art theory==
Feminist scholars have argued that the role of women art historians is connected to the study of women (as artists and as subjects) by art historians.&lt;ref name=schleif/&gt; In 1974, Lise Vogel noted that there were few feminist art historians, and that women art historians in general seemed unwilling to ask "the more radical critiques" a feminist scholar should engage in.&lt;ref name="vogel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Lise|editor1-first=Arlene|editor1-last=Raven|editor2-first=Cassandra L.|editor2-last=Langer|editor3-first=Joanna|editor3-last=Frueh|title=Feminist Art Criticism: An Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GT9-qWARitsC&amp;pg=PA24|year=1991|publisher=IconEditions|isbn=9780064302166|pages=21–58|chapter=Fine Arts and Feminism: The Awakening Consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1998 essay, [[Corine Schleif]] argued that women and feminist scholars need to challenge the "Great Master" canon, and that they need to focus less on "style as evidence of authorship", seen as a traditionally masculine way of viewing the history of art, but rather on style as "one of many sites on the production of meaning". The topic of women scholars in art history is thus intricately connected with what scholars have called [[feminist art theory]];&lt;ref name=schleif&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUQF7T5nXBkC|title=Attending to Early Modern Women|editor1-first=Susan Dwyer|editor1-last=Amussen|editor2-first=Adele F.|editor2-last=Seeff|first=Corine |last=Schleif|chapter=The Role of Women in Challenging the Canon of 'Great Master' Art History|year=1998|publisher=U of Delaware P|isbn=9780874136500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry Freedman, for example, claims that "women art historians often interpret art that is about and by women differently than their male colleagues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freedman|first=Kerry|year=1994|title=About This Issue: The Social Reconstruction of Art Education|journal=[[Studies in Art Education]]|volume=35|issue=3|pages=131–34|jstor=1320214|doi=10.2307/1320214}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Carol Armstrong]] and [[Catherine de Zegher]], in ''Women artists at the millennium'' (2006), argue that by the 1980s many "women art history scholars" had begun to think of feminism as irrelevant to the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History|chapter=Art and Architecture: Art History|pages=142–43|last=Mathews|first=Patricia|editor1-first=Bonnie G.|editor1-last=Smith|year=2008|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=9780195148909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diffusion de Broccard: Paris, 1991, pp. 109-110&lt;/ref&gt; is a town in the [[Mehakelegnaw Zone]] of the northern [[Tigray Region]] in [[Ethiopia]]. It served as the capital of the pre-[[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite]] kingdom of [[D'mt]].

==Archeology==
[[File:ET Tigray asv2018-01 img32 Yeha.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the great temple at Yeha in the [[Tigray Region]] of [[Ethiopia]].]]
The oldest standing structure in Ethiopia, the Temple of Yeha, is located in Yeha. This is a tower built in the [[Sabaean]] style, and dated through comparison with ancient structures in [[South Arabia]] to around [[709–700 BC|700 BC]]. Although no [[radiocarbon dating]] testing has been performed on samples from site, this date for the Great Tower is supported by local inscriptions.&lt;ref name=Phillipson-36&gt;David W. Phillipson, ''Ancient Churches of Ethiopia'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Phillipson]] attributes its "excellent preservation" to two factors, "the care with which its original builders ensured a level   foundation, firmly placed on the uneven bedrock; and to its rededication -- perhaps as early as the sixth century  AD -- for use as a Christian church."&lt;ref name=Phillipson-36/&gt; Two other archaeological sites at Yeha include [[Grat Beal Gebri]], a ruined complex distinguished by a [[portico]] 10 meters wide and two sets of square [[column|pillar]]s, and a graveyard containing several [[rock-cut architecture|rock-hewn]] shaft tombs first investigated in the early 1960s. One authority has speculated that one of these tombs contained a royal burial, while another believes the ancient residential area was likely one kilometer to the east of the modern village.&lt;ref&gt;Phillipson, ''Ancient Churches'', pp. 32, 37&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ancient Blocks With Sabaean Inscriptions, Yeha, Ethiopia (3146498586).jpg|thumb|Ancient stone slabs with [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]] inscriptions found at Yeha.]]
Additionally, Yeha is the location of an [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] monastery. The edifice was founded according to tradition by Abba Aftse, one of the [[Nine Saints]]. In his account of Ethiopia, [[Francisco Álvares]] mentions visiting this town in 1520 (which he called "Abbafaçem"), and provides a description of the ancient tower, the monastery, and the local church.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Alvarez, ''The Prester John of the Indies'' translated by C. F. Beckingham and G. W. B. Huntingford (Cambridge: [[Hakluyt Society]], 1961), pp. 140f&lt;/ref&gt; This church was either the rededicated Great Temple, or a now destroyed building which the [[Deutsche Aksum-Expedition]] described in the early 20th century. (The current structure, which exhibits Aksumite architectural features, was built between 1948 and 1949.)&lt;ref&gt;Phillipson, ''Ancient Churches'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)|Central Statistical Agency]] has not published an estimate for this village's 2005 population.

Yeha has also been the site of a number of archaeological excavations, beginning in 1952 by the [[Ethiopian Institute of Archeology]]. Although interrupted during the [[Derg]] regime, excavations were resumed in 1993 by a French archaeological team.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
