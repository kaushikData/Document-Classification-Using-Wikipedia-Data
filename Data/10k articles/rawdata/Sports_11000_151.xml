The '''1952 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race''', was the eighth annual running of the "blue water classic" [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]].

Hosted by the [[Cruising Yacht Club of Australia]] based in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], the 1950 edition began on [[Sydney Harbour]], at noon on [[Boxing Day]] (26 December 1952), before heading south for 630 nautical miles (1,170&amp;nbsp;km) through the [[Tasman Sea]], past [[Bass Strait]], into [[Storm Bay]] and up the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]], to cross the finish line in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].

The 1952 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race comprised a fleet of 17 competitors. The fleet found the going very difficult, and line-honours winner ''Nocturne'', skippered by JR Bull won in the second slowest-ever time of 6 days, 2 hours and 34 minutes. ''Ingrid'', skippered by JS Taylor was awarded handicap honours on adjusted time using the [[International Measurement System]] (IMS).

The '''2018 [[PBA Tour]] season''', the 59th season of play of the U.S. [[Professional Bowlers Association]]'s (PBA) [[ten-pin bowling]] tour, began on January 26, 2018. The season includes 21 singles title events, two doubles title events, and a non-title team event (PBA League). The 2018 season is being used to mark the PBA's 60th year of operations, which included a 148-player PBA 60th Anniversary Classic in [[Indianapolis]], and the unveiling of the Tour's top 60 moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cleveland.com/dman/2018/02/pba_tour_2018_live_scores_for_1.html|title=PBA Tour 2018: Live scores for PBA 60th Anniversary Classic TV finals|work=cleveland.com|access-date=2018-09-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesunion.com/sports/article/PBA-got-it-mostly-right-in-list-of-memorable-12729801.php|title=PBA got it (mostly) right in list of memorable moments|date=2018-03-05|work=Albany Times Union|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tournament schedule==

The [[PBA Tournament of Champions]] and the [[PBA Players Championship]] majors were held in February.&lt;ref name=PBApatterns&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bowlingdigital.com/pba-unveils-revamped-library-of-16-lane-oiling-patterns-for-2018-pba-tour/ |title=PBA Unveils Revamped Library of 16 Lane Oiling Patterns for 2018 PBA Tour |publisher=BowlingDigital.com |date=September 28, 2017 |accessdate=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The season's third major, the [[USBC Masters]], took place in April,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bowl.com/USBC_Masters/Masters_Home/Information/ |title=2018 USBC Masters - Information |publisher=bowl.com |accessdate=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[U.S. Open (bowling)|U.S. Open]] will be contested in late October. The PBA Tour Finals, first contested in 2017, returned for 2018, featuring the top eight money leaders from the start of 2016 through the 2018 Maine Shootout (April 18). It was held in [[Allen Park, MI]] on May 4-6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pba.com/Tournaments/Details/2641 |title=2018 PBA Tour Finals |publisher=bowl.com |accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2018, [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] announced that it had acquired the television rights for the PBA Tour, replacing [[ESPN]], with 26 broadcasts on [[Fox Sports 1]] and four on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] beginning in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/professional-bowlers-fox-sports-espn-1202731225/|title=Professional Bowling Rolls to Fox Sports|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=2018-03-20|work=Variety|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox will broadcast an additional PBA Clash event on December 23, 2018, to serve as Fox's first event and as a prelude for the 2019 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/sports/article_280e4b78-aa3f-11e8-95e8-1bff14df0f7e.html|title=Good news, Rob Stone moves to Fox for bowling telecasts|first=Kent|last=Lowe|work=The Advocate|access-date=2018-09-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the new agreement, the World Series of Bowling and [[PBA World Championship]] were postponed from the 2018 season and moved to March 2019, in order to have them be part of the new television arrangement. They were replaced on the schedule with a reinstated PBA Fall Swing, held in the [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] suburb of [[Owasso, Oklahoma]]. This event consisted of two standalone title events (Wolf Open and Bear Open), with these events serving as initial qualifying for the PBA Tulsa Open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pba.com/articles/Tulsa-to-Host-Multi-Event-PBA-Fall-Swing-in-October |title=Tulsa to Host Multi-Event PBA Fall Swing in October |last=Vint |first=Bill |publisher=PBA.com |date=April 30, 2018 |accessdate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesunion.com/sports/article/Dougherty-No-World-Series-of-Bowling-in-2018-12914283.php|title=Dougherty: No World Series of Bowling in 2018|date=2018-05-15|work=Albany Times Union|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was cancelled by Channel Ten at the end of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Aerobics bounced |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,17398305-10229,00.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2005-11-29 |accessdate=2008-01-24}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''AOS'' continues to be broadcast on Australian television via AURORA Channel 183 - on the Foxtel Digital, Optus and Austar platforms - which broadcasts ''Aerobics Oz Style'' every day at 6.30am AEST and also 2.00pm AEST. In Europe Aerobics Oz Style is broadcast daily (weekends included) on Sky Sports 1 or Sky Sports 2 at 6:00 (GMT) and it's repeated daily on Sky Sports 3 or Sky Sports 4 at 11:30 and 16:30. In 2011 Sky Sports started to broadcast additional airings of the show. The program is now aired in the small hours of the morning, as early as, 00:30 (GMT).

The series began in 1982 and had run continuously through until 2005, with over 4,500 episodes produced, by production company Zero1Zero (now Silk Studios). The format remained consistent throughout its run. Each show was 30 minutes divided into four segments, one of warmup exercises, two main exercise segments, and a stretch/cool-down segment. One instructor leads the exercises, with four demonstrators following to the side and behind.  Later shows were shot outdoors at scenic locations around [[Sydney]], in earlier shows an indoor studio was used.

Each show had an exercise theme. The mainstays since inception included high and low-impact, legs, abdominals, body toning. Other later themes included kick-boxing, low impact with a mixture of Latin dancing and pilates. Older styles included light hand weights and dynabands. Fashions in exercise-wear moved with the times too, [[leotard]]s over bicycle [[shorts]] in the early days giving way to [[halter top]]s and tight shorts.

A set of ''Aerobics Oz Style'' exercise videos are sold in a longer format than the shows broadcast, and include some exercise styles not otherwise featured, such as [[Swiss ball]]. These videos included music that remained unique and separate from the television show.

The instructors and demonstrators on the show were a mixture of men and women. The show was intended for any age or gender.

Many children watched the series inadvertently as they had switched on their televisions too early for the popular children's series [[Cheez TV]] which came after.

Australian band [[TISM]] parodied ''Aerobics Oz Style'' in their 1998 music video for "[[Whatareya?]]", in which all members start off following the instructor before drinking (and throwing) beer cans and jumping over couches.

In 1998 U NO HU, a UK songwriting duo, consisting of Gary Williams and Philip Barber were brought onboard and commissioned to write a mixture of more than three hundred instrumental dance tracks and chill-out tracks specifically for the television broadcasts and later exercise videos. The new, uplifting, music featured on over 1,500 later shows increased viewer ratings by twenty percent – on the BSkyB network – adding to the already established popularity of the program.

[[File:Jack Dempsey v Georges Carpentier cph.3b35134.jpg|thumb|[[Jack Dempsey]] and [[Georges Carpentier]] in the ring before the fight]]
'''Boyle's Thirty Acres '''was a large wooden bowl arena in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].  It was built specifically for the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|world heavyweight championship]] bout between [[Jack Dempsey versus Georges Carpentier|Jack Dempsey of the United States and Georges Carpentier of France]] on July 2, 1921.  It held approximately 80,000 fans and was built at a cost of $250,000. It was situated around Montgomery Street and Cornelison Avenue, on a plot of marshland owned by John F. Boyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last =  | first =  | title = Dempsey-Carpentier Fight Boyle's Thirty Acres at the Montgomery Oval | work = Jersey City Past and Present | publisher = [[New Jersey City University]] | year = 2007 | url = http://www.njcu.edu/programs/jchistory/Pages/D_Pages/Dempsey_Carpentier_Fight.htm | doi =  | access-date = March 18, 2011 | quote =  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150620113105/http://www.njcu.edu/programs/jchistory/Pages/D_Pages/Dempsey_Carpentier_Fight.htm# | archive-date = June 20, 2015 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Tex Rickard]], the promoter of the bout, initially wanted the fight to take place at the [[Polo Grounds]] in New York City.  However, [[Nathan Lewis Miller]], the [[governor of New York]], opposed prizefighting and indicated that he did not want a Dempsey-Carpentier bout to be held in New York State.  After a number of offers from other promoters, Rickard settled on a proposal from [[Frank Hague]], the [[mayor]] of Jersey City.  Hague obtained a parcel of land owned by John P. Boyle, a paper box manufacturer.  The site was once the home of the Jersey City baseball team.  The actual size of Boyle's land was {{convert|34|acre|m2}}.  The octagonal structure was built using {{convert|2250000|ft|m}} of [[lumber]].  The arena covered {{convert|300000|sqft|m2}} and during construction had the services of 500 carpenters and 400 laborers.  C.S. and J.W. Edwards were the contractors. Construction started on April 28, 1921 and was completed a few days before the fight. The arena was initially due to hold 50,000 fans.  However, the demand for the international extravaganza was so enormous that Rickard had to expand the arena to hold a capacity of around 80,000 to 90,000 fans. It had the greatest seating capacity of any [[amphitheatre]] ever built. In the contest between Dempsey and Carpentier, the strength and power of Dempsey was too much for the Frenchman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2011/10/author_discusses_battle_of_the.html|title=Author discusses 'Battle of the Century' between boxers Dempsey, Carpentier in Jersey City|author=|date=October 2011|website=NJ.com|access-date=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was knocked out in the fourth round, with a broken thumb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blumberg|first=Dorothy Rose|title=Whose What?|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|year=1969|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other notable boxing cards ==
Boyle's Thirty Acres was used for a number of [[boxing]] cards after the Dempsey–Carpentier bout. On Labor Day, 1921, Rickard promoted a card headlined by four champions - [[Johnny Wilson (boxer)|Johnny Wilson]], [[Mike McTigue]], [[Joe Gans]], and [[Johnny Buff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Four Champions in Ring on Labor Day|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 29, 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; On  July 27, 1922, the [[lightweight]] champion [[Benny Leonard]] recorded a newspaper decision win over [[Lew Tendler]].  [[Luis Ángel Firpo]] earned a title shot at Dempsey by knocking out ex-champion [[Jess Willard]] in the eighth round before a paid attendance of 75,712 on July 12, 1923.  Firpo had less luck in 1924 when he was defeated by [[Harry Wills]] before 70,000 fans.  Other notable fighters to have fought in Boyle's Thirty Acres were [[Tiger Flowers]], [[Paul Berlenbach]], and [[James J Braddock]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njboxinghof.org/cgi-bin/james-j-braddock/|title=NJ Boxing hall of Fame:Braddock's record|author=|date=|website=NJBoxingHOF.org|access-date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demise ==
By 1927, most major title bouts in the New York area were being held either at [[Yankee Stadium]] or the Polo Grounds.  Rickard announced that the wooden arena would be demolished and in June 1927 the [[wrecking ball]] brought the short history of Boyle's Thirty Acres to an end.

== Site==
By 1952, the site of Boyle's Thirty Acres had become a Jersey City housing project named Montgomery Gardens. After over 50 years of use, the project began to be emptied and the Jersey City Housing Authority planned to demolish the buildings in order to build mixed-use housing.

'''Dodger Stadium''', occasionally called by the [[metonymy|metonym]] '''Chavez Ravine''', is a [[baseball park]] located in the [[Elysian Park, Los Angeles|Elysian Park]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles, California]], the home field to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], the city's [[National League]] franchise of  [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). Opened {{Years or months ago|1962}} on April 10, 1962, it was constructed in less than three years at a cost of [[US$]]23 million, financed by private sources.&lt;ref name="omalleyconstr"/&gt;
Dodger Stadium is currently the oldest ballpark in MLB west of the [[Mississippi River]], and third-oldest overall, after [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston]] (1912) and [[Wrigley Field]] in [[Chicago]] (1914) and is the world's [[List of baseball parks by capacity|largest baseball stadium]] by seat capacity. Often referred to as a "[[pitcher|pitcher's]] ballpark", the stadium has seen twelve [[no-hitter]]s, two of which were [[perfect game]]s.

The stadium hosted the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] in [[1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1980]] - and will host in [[2020 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2020]] - as well as games of 10 [[World Series]] ([[1963 World Series|1963]], [[1965 World Series|1965]], [[1966 World Series|1966]], [[1974 World Series|1974]], [[1977 World Series|1977]], [[1978 World Series|1978]], [[1981 World Series|1981]], [[1988 World Series|1988]], [[2017 World Series|2017]], and [[2018 World Series|2018]]). It also hosted the semifinals and finals of the [[2009 World Baseball Classic|2009]] and [[2017 World Baseball Classic|2017]] [[World Baseball Classic]]s. It also hosted [[Baseball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|exhibition baseball]] during the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]. It will also host baseball and softball during the [[2028 Summer Olympics]].
The stadium hosted a [[soccer]] tournament on August 3, 2013 featuring four clubs, the hometown team [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], and Europe's [[Real Madrid]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], and [[Juventus]].

For the first time at Dodger Stadium, the [[Los Angeles Kings]] and [[Anaheim Ducks]] played a regular season game on January 25, 2014 as part of the [[NHL Stadium Series]].

==History==

===Construction===
In the mid-1950s, [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] team president [[Walter O'Malley]] had tried to build a [[Brooklyn Dodgers proposed domed stadium|domed stadium]] in the New York City borough of [[Brooklyn]], but was unable to reach an agreement with city officials for the land acquisition, and eventually reached a deal with the city of Los Angeles. The land for Dodger Stadium was seized from local owners and inhabitants in the early 1950s by the city of Los Angeles using [[eminent domain]] with funds from the Federal [[Housing Act of 1949]]. The city had planned to develop the Elysian Park Heights public housing project, which included two dozen 13-story buildings and more than 160 two-story townhouses, in addition to newly rebuilt playgrounds and schools, and a college.

Before construction could begin on the housing project, the local political climate changed greatly when [[Norris Poulson]] was elected mayor of Los Angeles in 1953. Proposed public housing projects such as Elysian Park Heights lost most of their support as they became associated with socialist ideals. Following protracted negotiations, the city purchased the [[Chavez Ravine]] property back from the Federal Housing Authority at a drastically reduced price, with the stipulation that the land be used for a public purpose. It was not until June 3, 1958, when Los Angeles voters approved a "Taxpayers Committee for Yes on Baseball" referendum, that the Dodgers were able to acquire {{convert|352|acre|km2}} of Chavez Ravine from the city. While Dodger Stadium was under construction, the Dodgers played in the league's largest capacity venue from [[1958 in baseball|1958]] through [[1961 in baseball|1961]] at their temporary home, the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], which could seat in excess of 90,000 people.

Los Angeles-based [[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]], in his seminal work on the city, ''[[City of Quartz]]'', describes the process of gradually convincing Chavez Ravine homeowners to sell. With nearly all of the original Spanish-speaking homeowners initially unwilling to sell, developers resorted to offering immediate cash payments, distributed through their Spanish-speaking agents. Once the first sales had been completed, remaining homeowners were offered increasingly lesser amounts of money, to create a community panic of not receiving fair compensation, or of being left as one of the few holdouts. Many residents continued to hold out despite the pressure being placed upon them by developers, resulting in the [[Battle of Chavez Ravine]], a ten-year struggle by the residents to maintain control of their property, which they ultimately lost. 

Dodger Stadium was the first Major League Baseball stadium since the initial construction of the original [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] to be built using 100% private financing, and the last until [[AT&amp;T Park]] in San Francisco opened in 2000.  Ground was broken for Dodger Stadium on September 17, 1959.  The top of local ridges were removed and the soil was used to fill in Sulfur and Cemetery Ravines to provide a level surface for a parking lot and the stadium.  A local elementary school (Palo Verde) was simply buried and sits beneath the parking lot northwest of third base.&lt;ref&gt;"Map--Diagram of proposed Dodger Stadium in Chavez Ravine – 1957." Los Angeles Examiner, 23 September 1957. http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll44/id/91758 Retrieved October 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of 8 million cubic yards of earth were moved in the process of building the stadium.  21,000 precast concrete units, some weighing as much as 32 tons, were fabricated onsite and lowered into place with a specially built crane to form the stadium's structural framework.  The stadium was originally designed to be expandable to 85,000 seats by expanding the upper decks over the outfield pavilions; the Dodgers have never pursued such a project.

Dodger Stadium was also the home of the [[Los Angeles Angels]] from [[1962 in baseball|1962]] through [[1965 in baseball|1965]]. To avoid constantly referring to their landlords, the Angels called the park '''Chavez Ravine Stadium''' (or just "Chavez Ravine"), after the geographic feature in which the stadium sits.

===Frank McCourt era===
[[Image:DodgerRenovation.JPG|thumb|left|Dodger Stadium seat removal, 2005 offseason.]]
[[Image:DodgerAYCE.jpg|thumb|right|The new [[All-you-can-eat seats (baseball)|all-you-can-eat buffet]] in the right-field pavilion]]
At the conclusion of the [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005 season]], the Los Angeles Dodgers made major renovations during the subsequent off-season.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The largest of these improvements was the replacement of nearly all the seats in the stadium. The seats that were removed had been in use since 1975 and helped give the stadium its unique "space age" feel with a color palette of bright yellow, orange, blue, and red. The new seats are in the original (more muted) 1962 color scheme consisting of yellow, light orange, turquoise, and sky blue. 2,000 pairs of seats were made available for purchase at $250, with the proceeds going to charity.

The baseline seating sections have been converted into retro-style "box" seating, adding leg room and a table. Other repairs were made to the concrete structure of the stadium. These improvements mark the second phase of a multi-year improvement plan for Dodger Stadium.

===Renovations===
Between 2003 and 2005, Dodger Stadium upgraded with [[LED display|LED video displays]]. The large main video display measures 27 feet high by 47 feet wide.&lt;ref name=display&gt;{{cite web |title=Daktronics on Display at Dodger Stadium|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4563919-1.html|work=All Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Dodgers announced a $412 million project to build a Dodger museum, shops, and restaurants around Dodger Stadium. In a press release, the team described the various features of the renovation as follows:
*Dodger Way – A tree-lined entrance will lead to a landscaped grand plaza where fans can gather beyond center field. The plaza will connect to a promenade that features restaurants, shops and the Dodger Experience museum showcasing the history of the Dodgers in an interactive setting.
*Green Necklace – The vibrant street setting of Dodger Way links to a beautiful perimeter around Dodger Stadium, enabling fans to walk around the park, outdoors yet inside the stadium gates. This Green Necklace will transform acres of parking lots into a landscaped outdoor walkway connecting the plaza and promenade to the rest of the ballpark.
*Top of the Park – The Green Necklace connects to a large scale outdoor plaza featuring breathtaking 360° views spanning the downtown skyline and Santa Monica Bay, the Santa Monica and San Gabriel Mountains, and the Dodger Stadium diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stadium Makeover Is Unveiled|first1=Dylan|last1=Hernandez|first2=Bill|last2=Shaikin|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/25/sports/sp-stadium25|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 25, 2008|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008–2009 offseason, the upper levels of the stadium were supposed to be renovated to match the repairs and improvements made to the field level. The improvements were to include the removal of the trough urinals in the men's restrooms, new concession stands and earthquake retrofitting to the concrete structure. It was also to include the replacement of the outfield scoreboards and monitors with new HD monitors. Due to the [[2009 World Baseball Classic]] hosted at Dodger Stadium, these renovations were put on hold. The divorce of Frank and Jamie McCourt, as well as a weak economy, were the reasons for the postponement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dodger Stadium Work on Hold|first=Kevin|last=Roderick|url=http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2009/11/dodger_stadium_work_on_ho.php|work=LA Observed|date=November 2, 2009|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To pay for an outstanding loan with the Dodgers former owner [[News Corporation]], former owner [[Frank McCourt (executive)|Frank McCourt]] used Dodger Stadium as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] to obtain a $250 million loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dodgers to Stay in Place for 25 Years|first=Barry M.|last=Bloom|url=http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050512&amp;content_id=1047676&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=May 12, 2005|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to give the Dodger Stadium area bounded by Academy Rd, Lookout Dr. and Stadium Way its own zip code, 90090 (as of July 2009). This also gives the area a new name, Dodgertown. The signs from the former Dodgertown spring training facility in [[Vero Beach, Florida]] will likely be integrated into the $500 million project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Dodgertown' Could Be Home Base|first=Alexandra|last=Zavis|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/08/local/me-dodgertown8|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 8, 2008|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New ownership and further renovation===

Following the sale of the Dodgers in 2012, the team brought in the architect, urban planner, and stadium specialist Janet Marie Smith to lead renovations efforts to the 50-year-old stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dodgers Hire Janet Marie Smith, Star Stadium Designer, To Renovate Dodger Stadium|first=Gene|last=Maddaus|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2012/08/dodgers_janet_marie_smith.php|work=[[LA Weekly]]|date=August 6, 2012|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith is best known as the driving force behind the massively influential Oriole Park at Camden Yards. She is also responsible for Turner Field in Atlanta and the most recent renovations at Fenway Park.&lt;/ref&gt; Renovations to Dodger Stadium began in the winter of 2012. Both video boards were replaced with High Definition screens, and new clubhouses and weight rooms were installed. The restrooms, concession stands, sound system and batting cages were also improved and renovated.

Dodgers owner [[Guggenheim Partners]] internally discussed moving the Dodgers to a new stadium at a [[Downtown Los Angeles]] site proposed by the [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] to allow an [[Proposed Los Angeles NFL stadiums|NFL team to build a stadium at the Dodger Stadium site]]. Guggenheim Partners also considered allowing an NFL team to build a stadium next to Dodger Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Not Everyone Shares Roger Goodell's Positive Sentiments Regarding L.A.

The extensive renovations to Dodger Stadium were ready for the 2013 season and included new HD hexagonal video and scoreboards, a new sound system, wider concourses, more standing room viewing areas, improved restrooms and a children's playground amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dodger Stadium Renovation Details|url=http://www.truebluela.com/2013/1/8/3851858/dodger-stadium-renovation-details|work=TrueBlueLA|date=January 8, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 2013 and 2014 seasons, more renovations were put in place. Dodger Stadium was the beneficiary of improvements such as wider concourses in the pavilions, new restaurants "Think Blue Bar-B-Que" and "Tommy Lasorda's Trattoria", dedicated team store buildings replacing the tents that previously served as team stores, bullpen overlooks with overlook bars, and tree relocation at the top of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2014 Dodger Stadium renovations: The secret of their access|url=http://dodgers.mlblogs.com/2014/01/07/2014-dodger-stadium-renovations-the-secret-of-their-access|date=January 7, 2014|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

===Design===
[[File:Dodger Stadium stairs 2015-10-04.jpg|thumb|upright|Stairs to upper deck and reserve seats]]

Dodger Stadium was one of the last baseball-only facilities built before the dawn of the [[multi-purpose stadium]]. It was built near [[Four Level Interchange|the convergence of several freeways]] near downtown Los Angeles, with an expansive parking lot surrounding the stadium. With the construction of many new MLB ballparks in recent years, it is now the [[list of Major League Baseball stadiums|third-oldest park]] still in use, and the oldest on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].

Dodger Stadium offered several innovative design features.  One of these was a covered and screened section of dugout-level seats behind home plate.  Dodger owner Walter O'Malley was inspired to incorporate this feature into the Dodger Stadium design after having seen it at Tokyo's [[Korakuen Stadium]] during the Brooklyn Dodgers' postseason goodwill tour of Japan in 1956.  The original dugout seating area was replaced by more conventional box seating in a 1999 renovation, but this feature has been replicated at [[Progressive Field]] in Cleveland and [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim]].

Two of Dodger Stadium's most distinctive features are the wavy roof atop each outfield pavilion and the top of a 10-story elevator shaft bearing the Dodger logo rising directly behind home plate at the top of the uppermost seating level.

[[File:Dodger Stadium landscaping 2015-10-04.jpg|thumb|Terraced landscaping in parking lot]]

A unique terraced-earthworks parking lot was built behind the main stands, allowing ticketholders to park at roughly the level of their seats, minimizing use of ramps once inside. The stadium was also designed to be [[earthquake]]-resistant, an important consideration in California, and it has withstood several serious earthquakes.

Dodger Stadium was originally equipped with two large [[Fair Play Scoreboards|Fair Play electronic scoreboard]] units above the left- and right-field pavilions.  The right-field board displayed in-game information.  The left-field board displayed scores of out-of-town games and other messages.  Smaller auxiliary scoreboards were installed at field level on the box seat fences beyond the first- and third-base dugouts during the inaugural 1962 season.  The left-field message board was replaced by a [[Mitsubishi Electric]] [[Diamond Vision]] video board in 1980. The field-level auxiliary scoreboards were replaced by larger units installed on the facade of the Loge (second) seating level in 1998; these, in turn, were replaced by a video ribbon board in 2006. Field-level out-of-town scoreboards were installed on the left- and right-field walls in 2003.

[[Strobe lights]] were added in 2001; they flash when the Dodgers take the field, after a Dodger home run, and after a Dodger win. 

[[File:Dodger Stadium hall of retired numbers 2015-10-04.jpg|thumb|Hall of retired numbers inside the stadium in 2015]]

===Retired numbers===
In addition to those of Don Drysdale, Sandy Koufax, and Don Sutton, the [[retired numbers]] of [[Pee Wee Reese]], [[Jackie Robinson]], [[Duke Snider]], [[Tommy Lasorda]], [[Walter Alston]], [[Roy Campanella]] and [[Jim Gilliam]] are mounted on the club level facade near the left field foul pole. On April 15, 2017, to mark the 70th anniversary of [[Jackie Robinson Day|Robinson's major league debut]], the Dodgers unveiled a bronze statue of the player in the stadium's left-field plaza. The 800-pound sculpture depicts Robinson sliding into home plate as a rookie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kramer|first1=Daniel|title=MLB celebrates Jackie Robinson Day|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/224513112/mlb-celebrates-jackie-robinson-day/|website=MLB.com|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dodgers devote significant resources to the park's maintenance. For example, it is repainted every year, and a full-time crew of gardeners maintain the site. As a result, it has stood the test of time very well, and no plans are in the works to replace it. Renovations were made in 1999 and again in 2004 that initially added additional field level seats, particularly behind home plate where previously the only person seen there was legendary scout Mike Brito, in his trademark [[Panama hat]] and [[cuban cigar]] tracking pitch speeds with a [[radar]] gun. After some criticism of the sightlines with these new seats, they were replaced with box seats.

Due to dry summers in Southern California, rainouts at Dodger Stadium are rare. Prior to 1976, the Dodgers were rained out only once, against the [[1967 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], on April 21, 1967, ending a streak of 737 consecutive games without a postponement. On April 12, 1976, the second home rainout ended a streak of 724 straight games. April 19–21, 1988 saw three consecutive rainouts, the only time consecutive games have been rained out at Dodger Stadium.&lt;ref name="baseball-statistics1"/&gt; No rainouts occurred between April 21, 1988 and April 11, 1999 – a major league record of 856 straight home games without a rainout.&lt;ref name="baseball-statistics1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dodger Stadium|url=http://www.baseball-statistics.com/Ballparks/LA/|work=Baseball Statistics|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That record has since been broken, with no rainouts since April 17, 2000, 1,471 consecutive games through April 15th, 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dodger Stadium rainouts are very rare|url=http://www.truebluela.com/2015/4/7/8363333/dodger-stadium-rainout-history|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seating===
In order to comply with a [[Special-use permit|conditional-use permit]] limiting Dodger Stadium's seating capacity to 56,000 it was the only current MLB park (through 2005 ) that had never increased its capacity. Whenever higher revenue lower seats were added some in the upper deck or pavilion were removed to keep the number the same.&lt;ref name="Cathedrals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowry|first=Phillip|title=Green Cathedrals|year=2005|publisher=Walker &amp; Company|location=New York City|isbn=0-8027-1562-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the sale of standing room only tickets, the Dodgers' 2009 home opener drew 57,099 fans, the largest crowd in stadium history. Following a number of incidents in the early 1970s in which fans showered [[Cincinnati Reds]] left fielder [[Pete Rose]] with beer, bottles, cups, and trash, the sale of beer was discontinued in both pavilions. Beer sales were reinstated in the right field pavilion in 2008, when that section was converted into the [[All-you-can-eat seats|All You Can Eat Pavilion]]. Fans seated in that section can eat unlimited hot dogs and peanuts and also have access to free soft drinks. There is a charge for beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/espn/thelife/news/story?id=6559938|title=An MLB guide to all you can eat|first=Rick|last=Paulas|date=18 May 2011|accessdate=8 July 2014|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the retirement of the original [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] and [[Shea Stadium]] in 2008, the park reigned as the largest capacity ballpark in the Majors.

As of 2010, there are a total of 2,098 club seats and 68 luxury suites. Both of these amounts will increase once the renovations are complete, with the necessary offset to comply with its conditional-use permit.

Due to renovations made in the 2012–2013 offseason, the current maximum capacity of Dodger Stadium is less than 56,000, although the team's president, [[Stan Kasten]], refuses to provide an exact number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/10/sports/la-sp-0811-dodgers-notes-20130811 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Bill | last=Shaikin | title=Dodgers take aim at 4-million home attendance | date=August 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 53,393 attendance is considered a sellout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=Dodgers|author=Los Angeles Dodgers|number=378406052506529792|date=13 September 2013|title=Tonight’s crowd of 53,393 represented the largest paid attendance in @MLB this season and was the #Dodgers 24th sellout of 2013.

===Center field dimension and playing surface===
[[Image:Dodger Stadium at Night - September 2002.jpg|right|thumb|Dodger Stadium in 2002]]
For various reasons, Dodger Stadium has long enjoyed a reputation as a pitchers' park. At first, the relatively deep outfield dimensions were a factor, with the power alleys being about 380 feet. Home plate was moved 10 feet toward center field in [[1969 in baseball|1969]], but that move also expanded foul ground by 10 feet, a tradeoff which helped to offset the increased likelihood of home runs caused by the decreased field dimensions.  Also, during evening games, as the sun sets, the surrounding air cools quickly due to the ocean climate, becoming more dense.  As a result, deep fly balls that might otherwise be home runs during the day instead often remain in play becoming outs. The park has been home to 12 [[no-hitter]]s, while players have [[hit for the cycle]] just twice in Dodger Stadium.

Recently, Dodger Stadium has been more neutral with respect to home runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MLB Park Factors|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/stats/parkfactor|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium does depress doubles and triples quite a bit, due to its uniform outfield walls and relatively small "corners" near the foul poles. However, the extremely short outfield walls near the foul poles also make some balls that would bounce off the wall in other parks go for home runs. With some expansion of the box seat area and the removal of significant foul territory, the ballpark has become more neutral, favoring neither pitchers nor hitters. Baseball-Reference's Park Factor measurement of 102 for the 2006 and 2007 seasons is evidence of this.

Although the distance to center field has been marked at 395&amp;nbsp;feet since 1973, it is still actually {{convert|400|ft|m}} to center, as has been the case since 1969. The two 395-foot signs erected in 1973 are to the left and right of dead center.&lt;ref name="Cathedrals"/&gt;  However, curvature of the fence between the posted distance signs is not exactly radial from home plate, thus the distance from home plate directly to center field is most likely 5 feet farther than the posted {{convert|395|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andrewclem.com/Baseball/DodgerStadium.html Clem's History of Dodger Stadium Dimensions]&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2012, distance to center field is indicated {{convert|395|ft|m}}, and is located virtually exactly at the center field point.

With the opening of [[Citi Field]] and the demolition of Shea Stadium in 2009, Dodger Stadium became the only stadium with symmetrical outfield dimensions remaining in the National League and only one of four total in Major League Baseball. The other three symmetrical fields are Kansas City's [[Kauffman Stadium]], Toronto's [[Rogers Centre]], and [[Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum]], all in the American League.

Pitchers such as [[Sandy Koufax]], [[Don Drysdale]], [[Don Sutton]], [[Fernando Valenzuela]], and [[Orel Hershiser]] became superstars after arriving in Los Angeles. The pitcher's edge is also evident in the fact that 12 [[no-hitter]]s have been thrown in the stadium, including two [[perfect game]]s (by the Dodgers' [[Sandy Koufax's perfect game|Sandy Koufax in 1965]], and by [[Dennis Martínez]] of the former [[Montreal Expos]] in {{mlby|1991}}). [[Bo Belinsky]] threw the first ever no-hitter in Dodger Stadium on May 5, 1962 while pitching for the Los Angeles Angels (that club referred to the park as "Chavez Ravine".)

The park's significant advantage was eroded somewhat since 1969, in general because MLB rules were changed after the "[[Year of the Pitcher]]" to lower the maximum height of the pitcher's mound, and more specifically because the Dodgers moved the diamond about 10 feet (3 m) towards center field. This also gave the fielders more room to catch foul balls, so there was some tradeoff. Following the [[2004 Major League Baseball season|2004 season]], the stadium underwent a renovation which significantly reduced the amount of foul territory. Seats were added which were closer to home plate than the pitcher's mound, the dugouts were moved 20 feet closer to the field, and previously open space down the foul lines was filled with new seats.

==Historic events==

===1963 World Series===
The Dodgers won the 1963 World Series over the New York Yankees, sweeping the Yankees by winning game 4 by a score of 2-1. Through the 2018 season, this remains the only time the Dodgers ever clinched a World Series at home.

===1988 National League Championship Series===
Until 1988, Dodger Stadium had never hosted a seventh game of a postseason series. The Dodgers won Game 7 of the 1988 National League Championship Series over the New York Mets, 6-0.

===Home Runs out of Dodger Stadium===
Five home runs have been hit completely out of Dodger Stadium.  Outfielder [[Willie Stargell]] of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] hit two of those home runs.  Stargell hit a 507-foot home run off the Dodgers' [[Alan Foster (baseball)|Alan Foster]] on August 6, 1969 that completely cleared the right field pavilion and struck a bus parked outside the stadium.  Stargell then hit a 470-foot home run off [[Andy Messersmith]] on May 8, 1973 that landed on the right field pavilion roof and bounced into the parking lot.  Dodger catcher [[Mike Piazza]] hit a 478-foot home run off Frank Castillo of the [[Colorado Rockies]] on September 21, 1997 that landed on the left field pavilion roof and skipped under the left field video board and into the parking lot.  On May 22, 1999, [[St. Louis Cardinals]] first baseman [[Mark McGwire]] cleared the left field pavilion with a 483-foot home run off the Dodgers' [[Jamie Arnold (baseball)|Jamie Arnold]] and most recently, on May 12, 2015, [[Giancarlo Stanton]] of the [[Miami Marlins]] hit a 478-foot home run over the left-field roof off [[Mike Bolsinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Giancarlo Stanton hits a ball out of Dodger Stadium|url=https://nypost.com/2015/05/12/giancarlo-stanton-hits-a-ball-out-of-dodgers-stadium/|accessdate=13 May 2015|work=[[New York Post]]|date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable events==

===Park Usage===
Dodger Stadium has also staged other sporting events such as boxing, a basketball game featuring the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] and a ski-jumping exhibition, as well as the baseball competition of the [[1984 Summer Olympic Games]] and is currently designated to host softball and baseball for the [[2028 Olympic Games]] with [[Angel Stadium]].

====Baseball====
In 1992, baseball games from April 30 to May 3 were postponed due to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]]. Three consecutive days of double headers were held later in the season.

====Soccer====
Dodger Stadium hosted a soccer doubleheader on August 3, 2013, part of the [[2013 International Champions Cup]], featuring [[Real Madrid]] of Spain, [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] of England, [[Juventus]] of Italy and [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] of [[Major League Soccer]] in a tournament semifinal. The field dimensions were from the third base side to right field; temporary grass was covered on the pitcher's mound and the infield. The tournament was a semifinal and Real Madrid defeated Everton 2-1 and Los Angeles Galaxy defeated Juventus 3-1.

The '''Extra Mile Endurathon''' ('''EME''') is an endurance marathon created by German philanthropist [[Alexander Skora]], in which participants must walk through a designated racecourse for as long as they can. Whoever walks for the longest amount of time, wins the competition. The EME is organized by Skora's company, Global Games Group, and it usually takes place in capital cities and other important metropolises in different countries around the world, with their racecourses often located in their busiest areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/Stadtleben-Extremsport;art125,2357832 tagesspiegel.de ''Der Tagesspiegel'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The first competition took place in [[Berlin, Germany]] on September 1, 2007. Twenty people participated and walked through popular areas of the city, such as the Olympic Stadium, the Tiergarten, the Brandenburger Tor and Potsdamer Platz. The winner of the competition was Mark Peus, a pilot for Lufthansa, who walked non stop for 36 hours.

The fourth competition took place on November 30, 2007 in [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]]. 50 contestants started the race in front of the [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti]] soccer stadium and walked day and night through downtown Buenos Aires. As the days went by and fewer people kept walking, the event became a media sensation and by its third day the remaining competitors had become instant celebrities. People would ask them for autographs, take pictures with them or show support from balconies and cars. By its fourth day, the EME was featured on the cover of Clarin, Argentina's biggest selling newspaper.

After 102 hours of walking, only two contestants were left. Marcelo Muzyka and Ivan Lamas were walking side by side, and were willing to keep going for as long as their legs could move. After careful consideration, the organization decided their sacrifice had been important enough and declared a technical tie. Both were awarded with a first prize and a plane ticket to participate in the next EME edition in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Diario Clarin, [http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/12/06/laciudad/h-1557933.htm Argentina]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American Football Kick.jpg|Execution of a field goal.|thumb|300px|right]]
A '''field goal''' ('''FG''') is a means of scoring in [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]]. To score a field goal the team in possession of the ball must place kick, or drop kick, the ball through the goal, i.e., between the uprights and over the crossbar.  American football requires that a field goal must only come during a [[play from scrimmage]], while Canadian football retains open field kicks and thus field goals may be scored at any time from anywhere on the field and by any player. The vast majority of field goals, in both codes, are place kicked. [[Drop kick#American and Canadian football|Drop kicked]] field goals were common in the early days of Gridiron football but are almost never done in modern times. In most leagues, a successful field goal awards three points (a notable exception is in [[six-man football]] where, due to the difficulty of making a successful field goal because of the small number of players available to stop the opposing team from attempting a block, a field goal is worth four points).

A field goal may also be scored through a [[fair catch kick]], but this is extremely rare. Since a field goal is worth only three points, as opposed to a [[touchdown]], which is worth six points, it is usually only attempted in specific situations (see [[#Strategy|Strategy]]).

The goal structure consists of a horizontal crossbar suspended {{convert|10|ft|m}} above the ground, with two vertical goalposts {{convert|18|ft|6|in|m}} apart extending vertically from each end of the crossbar.&lt;ref&gt;http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/rulebook/pdfs/4_2012_Field.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In American football, the goals are centered on each end line; in Canadian football, they are centered on each goal line.

==Strategy==
As a field goal is worth only three points, while a touchdown scores at least six (which usually becomes seven with a successful [[conversion (gridiron football)|conversion]], and potentially 8 with a [[two-point conversion]]), teams will generally attempt a field goal only in the following situations:

*It is fourth down (third down in Canadian rules), especially if the offense is more than a yard or two from a new first down, and within about 45 yards of the goal posts.
*In the first half, there is enough time remaining to execute only one more play.
*In the second half, there is enough time remaining to execute only one more play, and the team on offense needs three points to win or tie (four points in a few leagues given special circumstances).

Except in desperate situations, a team will generally attempt field goals only when keeping a drive alive is unlikely, and its [[placekicker|kicker]] has a significant chance of success, as a missed field goal results in a turnover at the spot of the kick (in the NFL) or at the line of scrimmage (in the NCAA). In American high school rules and Canadian football, where a missed field goal is treated the same as a punt, most teams still opt not to attempt field goals from very long range since field goal formations are not conducive to covering kick returns. Even under ideal conditions, the best professional kickers historically had difficulty making kicks longer than 50 yards consistently (the NFL record is 64 yards and the CFL record, 62 yards).&lt;ref name=battista&gt;{{cite news |last=Battista |first=Judy |title=Kickers Are Becoming Can’t-Miss Performers |date=November 6, 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=SP4 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/sports/football/in-nfl-placekickers-become-cant-miss-performers.html?_r=1&amp;sq=kicker%20percentage&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63CNba3PP?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/sports/football/in-nfl-placekickers-become-cant-miss-performers.html?_r=2&amp;sq=kicker%20percentage&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate=November 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all |access-date=February 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a team chooses not to attempt a field goal on their last down, they can [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] to the other team. A punt cannot score any points in American football unless the receiving team touches the ball first and the kicking team recovers it (though it can result in a [[single (football)|single]] in Canadian football), but it may push the other team back toward its own end.

The longest field goal kick in NFL history is 64 yards, a record set by [[Matt Prater]] on December 8, 2013. The previous record was 63, originally set by [[Tom Dempsey]] (1970) and then matched by [[Jason Elam]] (1998), [[Sebastian Janikowski]] (2011), [[David Akers]] (2012), and [[Graham Gano]] (2018). High school, college and most professional football leagues offer only a three-point field goal; however, some professional leagues have encouraged more rare kicks through ''four-point field goals''. [[NFL Europe]] encouraged long field goals of 50 yards or more by making those worth four points instead of three (much like Australian rules' [[Super Goal]] or basketball's [[three-point field goal|three-point line]]), a rule since adopted by the [[Stars Football League]]. Similarly, the sport of [[arena football]] sought (unsuccessfully) to repopularize the [[drop kick]] by making that worth four points; it failed, since only one kicker ([[Brian Mitchell (kicker)|Brian Mitchell]]) was able to do it with any semblance of proficiency. (In [[six-man football]], where there is no offensive line, all field goals are worth four points instead of the usual three.)

The overall field goal percentage during the [[2010 NFL season]] was 82.3.  In comparison, [[Jan Stenerud]], one of only two pure kickers in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] (along with [[Ray Guy]]), had a career field goal percentage of 66.8 from 1967 to 1985.&lt;ref name=battista/&gt;

==How field goals are kicked==
[[File:Field Goal.ogg|thumb|210px|Video of a successful field goal try.]]
When a team decides to attempt a field goal, it will generally line up in a very tight formation, with all but two players lined up along or near the line of scrimmage: the [[placekicker]] and the holder. The holder is usually the team's [[punter (football position)|punter]] or backup [[quarterback]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Instead of the regular [[center (American football)|center]], a team may have a dedicated [[long snapper]] trained especially to snap the ball on placekick attempts and punts.

The holder usually lines up seven to eight yards behind the line of scrimmage, with the kicker a few yards behind him. Upon receiving the snap, the holder holds the ball against the ground vertically, with the stitches away from the kicker. The kicker begins his approach during the snap, so the snapper and holder have little margin for error. A split-second mistake can disrupt the entire attempt.
[[File:2006TexasA&amp;MvsCitadel fieldgoal.jpg|thumb|right|213px|[[2006 Texas A&amp;M Aggies football team|Texas A&amp;M]] attempts&lt;!-- to kick--&gt; a field goal against [[2006 The Citadel Bulldogs football team|The Citadel]] in 2006]]

The measurement of a field goal's distance is from the goalpost to the point where the ball was positioned for the kick by the holder. In American football, where the goalpost is located at the back of the end zone (above the end line), the ten yards of the end zone are added to the yard line distance at the spot of the hold.

Until the 1960s, placekickers approached the ball [[Placekicker#Kicking_style|straight on]], with the toe making first contact with the ball. The technique of kicking the ball "[[Association football tactics and skills|soccer-style]]", by approaching the ball at an angle and kicking it with the instep, was introduced by [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born kicker [[Pete Gogolak]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cornellbigred.com/News/football/2007/10/29/DartNotes102907.asp?path=football{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting his roots in European soccer, Gogolak observed that kicking the ball at an angle could cover more distance than kicking straight-on; he played college football at [[Cornell Big Red football|Cornell]] and made his pro debut in [[1964 Buffalo Bills season|1964]] with the [[Buffalo Bills]] of the [[1964 American Football League season|AFL]]; his younger brother [[Charlie Gogolak|Charlie]] was also an NFL kicker. The soccer-style kick gained popularity and was nearly universal by the late 1970s;&lt;!-- Straight-on NFL kicker retire dates: George Blanda (1975), Fred Cox (1977), Errol Mann (1978) Jim Bakken (1978), Tom Dempsey (1979), Jim Turner (placekicker) (1979), Don Cockroft (1980), Russell Erxleben (last placekick: 1982),--&gt; the last straight-on kicker in the NFL was [[Mark Moseley]], who retired in [[1986 Cleveland Browns season|1986]].

==Successful field goals==
If there is any time left in the half, the method of resuming play after a successful field goal varies between leagues.

{{glossary end}}

==Missed field goals==
A missed field goal is said to be "no good" if the kicked ball does not cross between the uprights and over the crossbar of the goal posts. If it misses to the posts' left it may be called "wide left" and "wide right" if it misses to the posts' right. A field goal attempt may be described as  "short" if it does not have sufficient distance to go over the cross bar. Some commentators will only describe a field goal attempt as being short if it appears to have been aimed correctly while others will describe an attempt appearing to lack both accuracy and distance as being both wide and short.

If a field goal attempt is missed and does not go out of bounds, a defensive player may catch the ball and return it, like a punt or kickoff. This type of play usually occurs during an extremely long field goal attempt due to the distance the defense must travel to reach the returner. If there is a significant likelihood of a miss and the strategic game situation warrants it, the defense places a player downfield, in or near their end zone, to catch the ball. The risk in this is that the return man may be tackled deep in his own territory, at a considerably worse position than he could have gotten by letting the ball go dead (see below); furthermore, should the returner fumble the ball, the kicking team can recover it and gain a new set of downs (the advantage is that the kicking team is lined up very close together to stop kick blockers, and not spread across the field like a kickoff or punt team, and is therefore in poor position to defend the return). Thus, teams will usually return a kick only towards the end of a half (when the kick will be the final play) or in a particularly desperate situation.

If a ball caroms off one of the goal posts or the crossbar, but lands in the field of play, the ball is considered dead and cannot be returned. (This is not the case in [[arena football]], where large "rebound nets" surround the goal posts for the explicit purpose of keeping the ball in play.) However, if the ball caroms off one of the goal posts or the crossbar and continues into the goal, the score counts.

Situations where the defense does not return a missed field goal vary between leagues and levels of play:

{{glossary}}
{{term|1=National Football League}}
{{defn|1=Missed field goals attempted from the defending team's 20-yard line or closer result in the defense taking possession at their 20-yard line. Missed field goals attempted from behind the 20-yard line result in the opposing team taking possession at the '''spot of the kick'''. (From 1974-1993, the opposing team would take possession at the line of scrimmage, unless the kick was attempted from inside the 20-yard line, in which case the opposing team would take possession at the 20-yard line. Prior to 1974, a missed field goal was treated the same as a punt, and the kicking team could down the ball in the field of play if it did not cross the goal line; if the unsuccessful attempt crossed the goal line, it was a [[touchback]], unless the defense ran the ball out of the end zone.)}}

{{term|1=High school}}
{{defn|1=Under NFHS (high school) rules (except in Massachusetts and Texas, which play largely by NCAA rules), a field goal attempt is no different from any other scrimmage kick (punt, drop kick). If the field goal attempt is no good and enters the end zone it is a [[touchback]] (NFHS rules do not allow a scrimmage kick or free kick to be advanced if it crosses the goal line). If the ball becomes dead on the field the defensive team will next put the ball in play from that point. If a field goal is blocked behind the line of scrimmage either team may pick it up and return it (see below).}}

{{term|1=Canadian football}}
{{defn|1=If the defense does not return a missed field goal out of the end zone, or if a missed field goal attempt goes out the back of end zone, then the kicking team scores a [[single (football)|single point]]. This sometimes results in the team on defense stationing their punter behind the goal posts to punt the ball out of the end zone, in case of a missed field-goal attempt, to preserve a victory or tie. Also, a missed field goal may be played by any onside player on the kicking team, (onside players being the kicker and anyone behind him at the time of the kick). It is risky to have anyone positioned behind the kicker when the ball is being kicked since those player(s) would be unable to help prevent the defending players from blocking the kick; however, on occasion teams might intentionally miss a field goal in hope of recovering the ball in the end zone for a touchdown.

Returning a missed field goal is much more likely in Canadian football than in American rules for a few reasons. First, since the goal posts are on the goal line in front of a 20-yard end zone (rather than at the back of a 10-yard end zone), a missed field goal is much less likely to go out of bounds while in the air. Also, not returning the ball out of the end zone results in the defense conceding a single point, which may be crucial in a close game.  Moreover, the wider field of the Canadian game makes the average return longer (in terms of yardage). However, many Canadian football coaches judge that conceding a single and taking possession at the 35-yard line is preferable to returning a missed field goal and avoiding a single at the cost of poor field position.}}

==Blocked field goals==
[[File:David Akers field goal blocked at Eagles at 49ers 10-12-08.JPG|thumb|The [[San Francisco 49ers]] block a field goal attempt by [[Philadelphia Eagles]] kicker [[David Akers]] on October 12, 2008, and return it for a touchdown.]]
[[File:Fresno State Texas Aggies Blocked Kick.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Fresno State Bulldogs football|Fresno State Bulldogs]] block a [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|Texas A&amp;M]] field goal attempt.]]

Occasionally, the defense will succeed in blocking a field goal. If a blocked field goal is in or behind the neutral zone, it is treated like a [[fumble]] and can be advanced by either team. Beyond the neutral zone, a blocked kick is treated like a punt and can be advanced only by the defense, unless a defensive player fumbles the ball, after which an offensive player can advance it.

==History==
In the early days of football, kicking was highly emphasized. In [[1883 college football season|1883]], the scoring system was devised, with field goals counting for 5 points, and touchdowns and conversions worth 4 apiece. In [[1897 college football season|1897]], the touchdown was raised to 5 points while the conversion was lowered to 1 point. Field goals were devalued to 4 points in [[1904 college football season|1904]], and then to the modern 3 points in [[1909 college football season|1909]]. The touchdown was changed to 6 points in [[1912 college football season|1912]] in American football; the Canadian game followed suit in 1956.

The spot of the conversion has also changed through the years. In [[1924 college football season|1924]], NCAA rules spotted the conversion at the 3-yard line, before moving it back to the 5-yard line in [[1925 college football season|1925]]. In [[1929 college football season|1929]], the spot was moved up to the 2-yard line, which the NFL had done until {{nfly|2014}}. In [[1968 college football season|1968]], the NCAA diverged from the NFL rules in moving the spot back to the original 3-yard line. Canadian rules originally spotted the conversion at the 5-yard line, which remains closer than in the American code as the goalposts are at the front of the end zone.  In {{nfly|2015}}, to make conversion kicks harder, the NFL and CFL moved the spot of the kick to the 15 and 25-yard lines, respectively.  In addition, the CFL moved the spot for a two-point conversion up to the 3-yard line to entice more teams to go for 2 points as opposed to one.

The goalposts were originally located on the goal line; this led to many injuries and sometimes interfered with play. The NCAA moved the goal posts to the rear of the end zone in [[1927 college football season|1927]]. The NFL (still following NCAA rules at the time) followed suit, but moved the posts back to the goal line starting in the [[1932 NFL Playoff Game]], a change made necessary by the size of the indoor [[Chicago Stadium]] and kept when the NFL rules stopped mirroring the NCAA rules in {{nfly|1933}}. The NFL kept the post at the goal line until 1974, when they were moved back to the rear of the end zone. This was partly a result of the narrowed hashmark distance made in {{nfly|1972}}, which had made for easier field-goal angles. The Canadian game still has posts on the goal line.

The width of the goalposts and the hashmarks have also varied throughout the years. In [[1959 college football season|1959]], the NCAA goalposts were widened to {{convert|23|ft|4|in}}, the standard width for high school posts today. In [[1991 NCAA Division I-A football season|1991]], the college goalposts were reduced in width to {{convert|18|ft|6|in|abbr=on}}, matching the NFL. For the 1991 and [[1992 NCAA Division I-A football season|1992]] seasons, this meant potentially severe angles for short field goal attempts, since the hashmark width remained at {{convert|53|ft|4|in|abbr=on}}. In [[1993 NCAA Division I-A football season|1993]], the NCAA narrowed the distance between the hashmarks to {{convert|40|ft|2|abbr=on}}, matching what was the width of hashmarks in the NFL from {{nfly|1945}} through {{nfly|1971}}; the NFL narrowed the hashmarks in 1972 to goalpost width at {{convert|18.5|ft|2}}. In the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]], the hashmarks are {{convert|51|ft|}}, but the field is {{convert|195|ft}} in width, {{convert|35|ft}} wider than the American field.

The NFL increased the height of the uprights above the crossbar to {{convert|20|ft|2}} in {{nfly|1966}} and {{convert|30|ft|2}} in 1974. In {{nfly|2014}}, they were raised five feet to {{convert|35|ft|2}} after the adoption of a proposal by [[New England Patriots]] head coach [[Bill Belichick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nesn.com/2014/03/patriots-proposal-to-raise-goal-post-height-approved-by-nfl/|title=Patriots’ Proposal To Raise Goal-Post Height Approved By NFL Owners|author=|date=March 26, 2014|website=nesn.com|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "slingshot" goalpost, with a single post curving to support the crossbar, was invented by Jim Trimble and Joel Rottman in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=tdfcan&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CmwmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-VQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1734%2C836099 |newspaper=En Ville |location=(Montreal, Quebec, Canada)|title=Touchdown for Canada!|date=March 18, 1967 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first were built by [[Alcan]] and displayed at [[Expo 67]],&lt;ref name=tdfcan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2010-02-05/sports/fl-rottman-goal-post-super-bowl-0205-20100205_1_slingshot-post-orange-bowl|title=Who invented the slingshot goal post?|author=|date=|website=sun-sentinel.com|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[World's fair]] in Montreal. The NFL had standardized the goalposts in 1966 and adopted the slingshot for the {{nfly|1967}} season;&lt;ref name=tdfcan/&gt; the NCAA later adopted the same rule, but later allowed the use of "offset" goalposts, with two posts rather than one (which were the norm prior to the invention of the "slingshot" goalposts). The CFL was the first league to use the new goalposts; they made their debut in the 2nd game of the CFL's Eastern Conference final in 1966 (which was played at Montreal's [[Autostade]] as Landsdowne Park [now [[TD Place Stadium]]], the home of [[Ottawa Rough Riders]], was undergoing renovations), and were used in the Grey Cup the next week at Vancouver's [[Empire Stadium (Vancouver)|Empire Stadium]]. Three schools in [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] currently use dual-support posts: [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]], [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]], and [[Washington State Cougars football|Washington State]]. A special exemption was allowed by the NFL for the [[New Orleans Saints]] to use the offset goalposts during the [[2005 New Orleans Saints season|2005]] season, when they used [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|LSU's stadium]] for home games [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Saints|after]] [[Hurricane Katrina]].

Goalposts at the professional level today are sometimes equipped with a camera mounted to the stanchion immediately behind the center of the crossbar. Since these cameras are both above and slightly behind the crossbar, a field goal attempt will be judged good if it strikes this equipment.

In [[1989 NCAA Division I-A football season|1989]], the NCAA banned the kicking tee for field goals and extra points, requiring kicks from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V109/N1/foot.01s.html|title=NCAA rules change will ban tees on FGs, PATs - The Tech|author=|date=|website=tech.mit.edu|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068759/index.htm | work=CNN | title=No More Tee Party | date=September 4, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the {{nfly|2011}} NFL season, a record 90 field goals of 50 yards or longer were made.&lt;ref name="teamrankings.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/player-stat/field-goals-succeeded-50-plus|title=NFL Football Player Stats &amp; Stats Leaders - Field Goals Made, 50+ Yards|author=|date=|website=www.teamrankings.com|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{nfly|2012}}, this record was increased to 92 field goals of 50 yards or longer.&lt;ref name="teamrankings.com"/&gt;

==Longest missed field goal return records==

===NFL===
Field goal returns are rare in the NFL, since an attempt with sufficient distance that misses the uprights will automatically be dead. Returns are possible when a field goal is short, but in that case returners will usually down the ball so as to scrimmage from the spot of the kick. Normally, a return will only be attempted when there is not enough time left in the half to run a play from scrimmage. Nevertheless, four field goals have been returned for at least 107 yards in the 21st century:

===CFL===
Because the goalposts in Canadian football are on the goal line, and because downing the ball in the end zone results in the kicking team scoring a [[single (Canadian football)|single point]], field goal returns are much more common. The longest missed field goal return in the CFL is 131 total yards. Against the [[Montreal Alouettes]] on August 22, 1958, the [[Toronto Argonauts]]' Boyd Carter ran 15 yards, then threw a lateral to [[Dave Mann (American football)|Dave Mann]], who then returned it for the final 116 yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cflapedia.com/records.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513204431/http://www.cflapedia.com/records.htm |archivedate=May 13, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This return, which started 21 yards behind the goal line, was during the era of 25-yard end zones (which made the maximum theoretical missed field return distance 134 yards in those days) and therefore cannot be met or exceeded on the modern field with 20-yard end zones. Since the shortening of the end zones in the CFL in 1986, a field goal has been returned for the maximum 129 yards on four occasions: by [[Bashir Levingston]] of the Toronto Argonauts on June 28, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Qouhh-gA08Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Dominique Dorsey]] also of the Toronto Argonauts on August 2, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|date= |title=Dominique Dorsey's record tying missed field goal return for a touchdown vs. the Montreal Alouettes |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTv_oE-3fls |format=Video |medium= |publisher= |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Tristan Jackson]] of the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] on July 14, 2012 &lt;ref&gt;http://cfl.ca/video/index/id/76119&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Trent Guy]] of the Montreal Alouettes on September 23, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://cfl.ca/article/hes-the-guy-129-yard-touchdown-seals-win-for-als&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gold Coast Aquatic Centre''' (also known as the Optus Aquatic Centre for the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games) is a public [[swimming pool]] complex located in the [[Southport Broadwater Parklands]] on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Queensland]].&lt;ref name=Official&gt;{{cite web |title=Gold Coast Aquatic Centre |url=http://www.goldcoastac.com.au/home.html |publisher=Gold Coast Aquatic Centre |accessdate=10 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115051958/http://www.goldcoastac.com.au/home.html |archivedate=15 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the swimming and diving facility for the [[2018 Commonwealth Games]].&lt;ref name="Games bid a 'nail-biter', says Premier"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lacey|first=Michelle|title=Games bid a 'nail-biter', says Premier|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2011/11/05/363461_gold-coast-news.html|accessdate=10 December 2011|newspaper=Gold Coast Bulletin|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Gold Coast Aquatic Centre.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Gold Coast Aquatic Centre in 2015]]
The ''Gold Coast Aquatic Centre'' opened in the 1960s as the ''Southport Pool''.&lt;ref name="Presentation Booklet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadwater Parklands presentation booklet|url=http://www.gcparks.com.au/userfiles/file/BroadwaterParklands.pdf|publisher=Gold Coast Parks|accessdate=20 December 2011|year=2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202023412/http://www.gcparks.com.au/userfiles/file/BroadwaterParklands.pdf|archivedate=2 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex was renamed to the ''Gold Coast Aquatic Centre'' in the late 2000s.&lt;ref name=Official /&gt; In 2018, the Gold Coast hosted the [[Commonwealth Games]].&lt;ref name="Coast wins 2018 Commonwealth Games"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ardern|first=Lucy|title=Coast wins 2018 Commonwealth Games|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2011/11/13/365241_gold-coast-news.html|accessdate=10 December 2011|newspaper=Gold Coast Bulletin|date=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gold Coast Aquatic Centre'' was the swimming and diving facility for the event. Approximately $40 million was spent on redeveloping the complex. The redevelopment included the construction of an additional 10-lane [[Olympic-size swimming pool|competition pool]], additional change rooms and new meeting rooms.&lt;ref name="Games bid a 'nail-biter', says Premier" /&gt; Although the expansion was expected to be completed by 2017,&lt;ref name="Tweed region to share in Commonwealth Games windfall"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chambers|first=Geoff|title=Tweed region to share in Commonwealth Games windfall|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/tweed-region-to-share-in-commonwealth-games-windfall/story-e6frexni-1226199508611|accessdate=10 December 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the construction was brought forward to allow the venue to host the [[Pan Pacific Swimming Championships]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="Coast to host Pan Pacs swimming in 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Willoughby|first=Shannon|title=Coast to host Pan Pacs swimming in 2014|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2012/11/10/441574_gold-coast-news.html|accessdate=10 November 2012|newspaper=Gold Coast Bulletin|date=10 November 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111181622/http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2012/11/10/441574_gold-coast-news.html|archivedate=11 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work began on the redevelopment in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ardern|first=Lucy|title=Call to start Carrara sports precinct plans|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2013/03/06/448186_gold-coast-news.html|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=Gold Coast Bulletin|date=6 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309040758/http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2013/03/06/448186_gold-coast-news.html|archivedate=9 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[baseball]], a '''grand slam''' is a [[home run]] hit with [[bases loaded|all three bases occupied by baserunners]] ("bases loaded"), thereby scoring four [[run (baseball)|runs]]—the most possible in one play. According to ''The Dickson Baseball Dictionary'', the term originated in the card game of [[contract bridge]],{{better source|reason=Dickson does say that, but in fact the term was used in the original game of bridge, a.k.a. Biritch or Russian whist, about 40 years before it was developed into contract bridge.  See History under Contract bridge, and the original rulebook in Wikisource.  It would be correct to simply say bridge here, but that's not what the cited source says.|date=November 2016}} in which a ''grand slam'' involves taking all the possible tricks. The word ''slam'', by itself, usually is connected with a loud sound, particularly of a door being closed with excess force; thus, ''slamming the door'' on one's opponent(s), in addition to the bat slamming the ball into a home run.

==Notable highlights==
[[Roger Connor]] is believed to have been the first major league player to hit a grand slam, on [[1881 in baseball|September 10, 1881]], for the [[Troy Trojans (MLB team)|Troy Trojans]].  Although [[Charlie Gould]] hit one for the [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] (now the Atlanta Braves) in the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]] (NA) on [[1871 in baseball|September 5, 1871]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1871#September |title=The Chronology – 1871 |last=Charlton |first=James |accessdate=2007-10-29 |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017051521/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1871 |archivedate=2007-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|NA]] is not recognized by [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] as a major league.
[[File:Don Mattingly.JPG|thumb|right|In 1987 Don Mattingly set the record for most grand slams in a single season with six.]]
[[Alex Rodriguez]] has 25 career grand slams, the most by any player in [[Major League Baseball]] history, passing [[Lou Gehrig]]'s 23 on September 20, 2013. [[Don Mattingly]] set the one-season record with six grand slams in {{Baseball year|1987}} – remarkably, the only grand slams of his major league career. [[Travis Hafner]] tied Mattingly's Major League record in {{Baseball year|2006}}, while in {{Baseball year|2009}}, [[Albert Pujols]] tied the one-season National League record of five grand slams set by [[Ernie Banks]] in {{Baseball year|1955}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_grsl.shtml|title=Grand Slam Records|author=|date=|website=www.baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several grand slams, the first being Connor's in 1881, consisted of a player hitting a [[walk-off home run|walk-off grand slam]] for a one-run victory; some baseball observers call this an "ultimate grand slam".&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/news/2002/05/17/ultimate_grand_slams |title=Ultimate Grand Slams|publisher=SI.com|date=2002-05-18|accessdate=2002-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;    [[Roberto Clemente]] is the only player to have hit a walk-off [[Inside-the-park home run|inside-the-park]] grand slam in a one-run victory;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://armorypitching.com/grand-slam-baseball/|title=Grand Slam (baseball) {{!}} The ARMory Power Pitching Academy|website=armorypitching.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] defeated the [[Chicago Cubs]] 9–8 on [[1956 in baseball|July 25, 1956]] at [[Forbes Field]], a park known for its spacious outfield.

On April 10, 1980 – on [[Opening Day]], the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]' [[Sixto Lezcano]] hit a walk-off Grand Slam, reportedly the first such feat on an Opening Day. (Lezcano also has the distinction of hitting a Grand Slam the previous year, also on Opening Day.)

During the {{Baseball year|2005}} major league season, grand slams accounted for 132 of the 5017 home runs hit (2.6%). On June 13–14, {{Baseball year|2006}}, the [[Minnesota Twins]] hit grand slams in consecutive games against the [[Boston Red Sox]], including a [[walk-off home run|walk-off]] grand slam by [[Jason Kubel]] in the 12th inning on June 13.

In {{Baseball year|2006}}, the [[Chicago White Sox]] hit grand slams in three consecutive games against the [[Houston Astros]] (June 23–25). Scott Podsednik hit the only grand slam of his career in the series opener.  Joe Crede followed up with a slam of his own on Saturday, and Tadahito Iguchi hit a game tying grand slam in the bottom of the ninth with two outs in the series finale.  (This followed a three run blast by Iguchi in the bottom of the eighth.) The White Sox became the first team to accomplish this since the [[Detroit Tigers]] in {{Baseball year|1993}}. On the other hand, the {{Baseball year|2007}} [[Kansas City Royals]] surrendered grand slams in three straight games; two against the [[Baltimore Orioles]] (April 13–14) and one against the Tigers (April 16).

Also in 2006, [[Travis Hafner]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]] set a major league record by hitting five grand slams prior to the All-Star break, on his way to tying Mattingly for one season (his sixth was on August 13.) On July 16, [[Carlos Beltrán]] and [[Cliff Floyd]] of the [[New York Mets]] hit grand slams during an 11-run sixth inning against the [[Chicago Cubs]], marking the eighth time two grand slams were hit in a team's at-bat (the fourth time in National League history).

Four players hit a grand slam in their first Major League at-bat: [[Bill Duggleby]] ({{Baseball year|1898}}), [[Jeremy Hermida]] ({{Baseball year|2005}}), [[Kevin Kouzmanoff]] ({{Baseball year|2006}}), and [[Daniel Nava]] ({{Baseball year|2011}}). Kouzmanoff, Nava, and Duggleby hit theirs on the first pitch; Hermida's grand slam was in a [[pinch-hit]] [[at bat]].
[[File:Fernando Tatis.jpg|thumb|right|Fernando Tatís (pictured with the Mets) is the only player to hit two grand slams in the same inning, with the Cardinals, in 1999.]]
[[Tony Cloninger]] is the only pitcher to hit two grand slams in one game, for the [[Atlanta Braves]] in a {{Baseball year|1966}} contest against the [[San Francisco Giants]].

[[Félix Hernández]] of the [[Seattle Mariners]] became the first American League pitcher since the [[designated hitter]] rule went into effect in {{Baseball year|1973}} to hit a grand slam when he did so on June 23, [[2008 in baseball|2008]], off New York Mets ace [[Johan Santana]] in an interleague game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/mariners/2008013961_marinotes24.html |title=Notebook – Grand slam by Felix Hernandez is one for the books |accessdate=2008-12-30 |work=The Seattle Times |first=Larry |last=Stone |date=June 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906222415/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/mariners/2008013961_marinotes24.html |archivedate=September 6, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only major leaguer to hit two grand slams in one inning is [[Fernando Tatís]] of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], on [[1999 in baseball|April 23, 1999]] at Dodger Stadium, with both grand slams coming off Los Angeles' [[Chan Ho Park]] in the third inning. Tatis was only the second National League player to hit two grand slams in one game, joining Cloninger. Park was only the second pitcher in major league history to give up two grand slams in one inning; [[Bill Phillips (pitcher)|Bill Phillips]] of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] did it on [[1890 in baseball|August 16, 1890]], one to [[Tom Burns (baseball)|Tom Burns]] and one to [[Malachi Kittridge]], but Park was the first to give up both to the same batter. Tatis had never hit a grand slam before in his career. [[Bill Mueller]] is the only player to hit grand slams from both sides of the plate in the same game, when he hit 2 on [[2003 in baseball|July 29, 2003]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]] vs. the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. [[Robin Ventura]] is the only player to hit a grand slam in both games of a doubleheader, when he did so on [[1999 in baseball|May 20, 1999]] for the [[New York Mets]] against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]].

In [[Nippon Professional Baseball|Japan's professional league]], the feat of multiple grand slams in a single inning by a team has been accomplished three times; most recently on [[2007 in baseball|April 1, 2007]] by [[José Fernández (third baseman)|José Fernández]] and [[Takeshi Yamasaki]] of the [[Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles]]. The [[Daiei Hawks]] accomplished the feat in {{Baseball year|1999}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/sports/20070402TDY24002.htm|title=Hawks pound Shimizu, Marines|accessdate=2007-04-02}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, 2011, the [[New York Yankees]], hosting the [[Oakland A's]], became the first team in MLB history to hit three grand slams in one game. [[Robinson Canó]], [[Russell Martin]] and [[Curtis Granderson]] took pitchers [[Rich Harden]], [[Fautino de los Santos]], and [[Bruce Billings]] deep, with each grand slam being hit in a different inning. Coming back from a 7–1 deficit, the second grand slam gave the Yankees their first lead of the game; they went on to win 22–9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Caldwell, Dave|title=On a Long and Wet Day, the Yankees Win in Grand Style|date=August 25, 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/sports/baseball/yankees-win-in-grand-style-on-a-long-and-wet-day.html|work=The New York Times}} and {{cite news|author=Mouat, Mike|title=Yankees slam Athletics in grand fashion|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/26/us-baseball-yankees-slams-idUSTRE77P0FX20110826|date=August 25, 2011|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Slusser, Susan|authorlink=Susan Slusser|title=Yankees hit 3 grand slams to beat A's 22–9|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/08/25/SPQQ1KRV9D.DTL|date=August 25, 2011|work=San Francisco Chronicle|publisher=Hearst|accessdate=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Parker, Rob|title=It was a grand ole day at the ballpark|url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/6896894/new-york-yankees-set-record-grand-day-bronx|date=August 25, 2011|work=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 2014, [[Buster Posey]] and [[battery (baseball)|batterymate]] [[Madison Bumgarner]] of the [[San Francisco Giants]] hit grand slams against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. It marked the first time in Major League Baseball history that batterymates hit grand slams in the same game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pavlovic|first1=Alex|title=Giants' battery of Bumgarner, Posey provide charge heading to All-Star break|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/giants/ci_26142051/giants-battery-bumgarner-posey-provide-charge-heading-all|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2017, a record-breaking seven grand slams were hit on one day: one each for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Milwaukee Brewers]], [[Atlanta Braves]], [[Colorado Rockies]], [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Seattle Mariners]], and most notably, by the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] whose [[Albert Pujols]] hit his 600th career home run.

==Walk-off grand slams==
A player on the home team that hits a grand slam in the ninth or subsequent inning, which [[Walk-off home run|wins his team the game]], is known as a ''Walk-off grand slam''.

Starting in the 1990s, a walk-off grand slam that erases a three-run deficit has come to be known as an '''ultimate grand slam'''.&lt;ref&gt;Krabbenhoft, Herm.

Only five pitchers in major league history have surrendered two game-ending grand slam home runs in one season, according to the [[Elias Sports Bureau]]:

* [[Lee Smith (baseball)|Lee Smith]] of the [[California Angels]], in {{Baseball year|1995}}, to [[Mark McGwire]] of the [[Oakland Athletics]], on June 30, and to [[Albert Belle]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]] on July 18.
* [[Francisco Rodríguez (Venezuelan pitcher)|Francisco Rodríguez]] of the [[New York Mets]], in {{Baseball year|2009}}, to [[rookie]]s [[Everth Cabrera]] of the [[San Diego Padres]], on August 7, and [[Justin Maxwell]] of the [[Washington Nationals]] on September 30.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3691">'''Hipódromo Camarero''', formerly known as '''El Nuevo Comandante''', is a [[horse racing]] building located in [[Canóvanas, Puerto Rico]], to the east of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] and [[Carolina, Puerto Rico|Carolina]]. It is about a fifteen-minute drive from Carolina's [[Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport]], and 25 minutes east from the Isla Verde [[hotel]] area. The new administration of Camarero Race Track Corporation start operations on January 5, 2007.

El Nuevo Comandante was built in 1976,and opened on October 31, 1976, to substitute the original "El Comandante" building, which had been located in Carolina, from January 1957 to mid October 1976. It has become arguably the most important horse racing complex in the island, holding horse races every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

El Nuevo Comandante features a [[gambling|betting]] window, in which players can try their luck at different games, such as "El Pool Pote" and others. The top award a player can win at El Nuevo Comandante is the "Pool Pote" (Pool Pot) and it reached a staggering 12 Million dollars and has been the largest pot ever won in Puerto Rico's Horse Racing Industry. In addition to the betting windows at El Nuevo Comandante, the Industry has a link of betting agencies throughout Puerto Rico. These are called "agencias hipicas", and people can go there to place bets as well and enjoy local refreshments and snacks.

Races at "El Nuevo Comandante" have been shown on local [[television]] and Les Oraliens  on [[radio]] since the building was inaugurated. Some of the most famous television sportscasters in [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] history have commented from there, including [[Norman H. Davila]] and [[Manolo Rivera Morales]].

Some famous jockeys have run there too, including Hall of Famer [[Angel Cordero]], John Velazquez and [[J.C. Diaz]].

Famous horses imported to run at El Nuevo Comandante have been: Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes winner [[Bold Forbes]], Santa Anita Derby winner [[Mister Frisk]]y, Bandit Bomber and [[Dawn Glory]] (Stakes winner in USA).

Among the native horses: Hurly Road (Triple Crown winner), Ribot's Verset (one of the best sires in Puerto Rican history), My favorite Place (Multiple allowance winner in California) Capa Prieto (undefeated for years), [[Camarero]] (Holds a record of 56 consecutive wins in a row), Vuelve Candy B (Triple Crown and Caribbean Derby winner and the only horse to earn a million dollars in Puerto Rico), Verset Dancer (Caribbean Derby winner and winner in USA) and Verset's Jet (son of Verset Dancer) who's the first horse to complete the Caribbean Derby and Confraternidad Stakes double. 

El Nuevo Comandante also has the infamous distinction (Guinness record) of having the horse with the most consecutive losses (Dona Chepa) with 134 consecutive loses (through 11/2/08 without a win){{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

El Nuevo Comandante is also the site where the most famous race in the [[Caribbean]] has been held for 32 years: The [[Clasico del Caribe]] is celebrated there yearly, with horses participating from Colombia, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Puerto Rico, among other countries.

A&amp;nbsp;'''midfielder''' is an [[Association football positions|association football position]].&lt;ref name="BBCsport1"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197190.stm|title=Positions guide: Central midfield|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate= 27 August 2013 | date=1 September 2005 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Midfielders are generally positioned on the field between their team's [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] and [[Forward (association football)|forwards]]. Some midfielders play a disciplined defensive role, breaking up attacks, and are otherwise known as defensive midfielders. Others blur the boundaries, being more mobile and efficient in passing: they are commonly referred to as deep-lying midfielders, play-makers, box-to-box, or holding midfielders. The number of midfielders on a team and their assigned roles depends on the team's [[Formation (association football)|formation]]; the collective group of these players on the field is sometimes referred to as the '''midfield'''.&lt;ref name="ExpertFootball1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expertfootball.com/coaching/positions.php|title=Football / Soccer Positions|publisher=Expert Football|accessdate=21 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Manager (association football)|managers]] assign at least one midfielder to disrupt the opposing team's attacks, while others may be tasked with creating goals, or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence. Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match.  Because midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game they are among the fittest players on the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Di Salvo | first = V. | title = Performance characteristics according to playing position in elite soccer. | journal = International Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 222–7 | date = 6 October 2006| doi=10.1055/s-2006-924294 | pmid=17024626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central midfielder==
{{anchor| Centre midfielder}}
[[File:Xavi Euro 2012 vs France 01.jpg|right|thumb| Former [[Spain national football team|Spain]] midfielder [[Xavi]] was voted to the [[FIFPro#FIFPro World XI|FIFPro World XI]] eight years in a row.]]

'''Central''' or '''centre midfielders''' are players whose role is divided roughly equally between attack and defence and to dominate the play around the centre of the pitch. These players will try to [[Passing (association football)|pass]] the ball to the team's [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielders]] and forwards and may also help their team's attacks by making runs into the opposition's [[penalty area]] and attempting [[Shooting (association football)|shots]] on goal themselves.

When the opposing team has the ball, a central midfielder may drop back to protect the goal or move forward and [[Glossary of association football terms#P|press]] the opposition ball-carrier to recover the ball. A centre midfielder defending their goal will move in front of their [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-backs]] in order to block long [[Shooting (association football)|shots]] by the opposition and possibly track opposition midfielders making runs towards the goal.

The [[Formation (association football)#4.E2.80.933.E2.80.933|4–3–3]] and [[Formation (association football)#4.E2.80.935.E2.80.931|4–5–1]] formations each use three central midfielders. The [[4-4-2 formation|4−4−2]] formation may use two central midfielders,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197518.stm|title = Formations guide|date = |accessdate = 31 October 2014|website = BBC|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Formation (association football)#Common modern formations#4-2-3-1|4–2–3–1]] formation one of the two deeper midfielders may be a central midfielder.

===Box-to-box midfielder===

The term '''box-to-box midfielder''' refers to central midfielders who are hard-working and who have good all-round abilities, which makes them skilled at both defending and attacking.&lt;ref name="BBCsport3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1957308.stm|title=Box to box Bowyer|date=29 April 2002|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=21 June 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; These players can therefore track back to their own box to make tackles and block shots and also run to the opponents' box to try to score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.espnfc.com/fifa-world-cup/story/1861193/in-praise-of-the-box-to-box-midfielder|title = In praise of the box-to-box midfielder|date = 4 June 2014|accessdate = 31 October 2014|website = ESPN FC|publisher = |last = Cox|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change of trends and the deviation from the standard 4–4–2 formation to the 4–2–3–1 formation imposed restrictions on the typical box-to-box midfielders of the 80s, as teams' two midfield roles were now often divided into "holders" or "creators".&lt;ref name="WilsonHolding13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/dec/18/question-holding-midfielders-changing-role|title=The Question: what does the changing role of holding midfielders tell us?|last=Wilson|first=Jonathan|author-link=Jonathan Wilson (writer)|date=18 December 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wide midfielder==
'''Left''' and '''right midfielders''' have a role balanced between attack and defence, similar to that of central midfielders, but they are positioned closer to the [[Touch-line|touchlines]] of the [[Association football pitch|pitch]]. They may be asked to [[Cross (football)|cross]] the ball into the opponents' penalty area to make scoring chances for their teammates, and when defending they may put pressure on opponents who are trying to cross.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197228.stm|title = Wide midfielder|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2014|website = BBC|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common modern formations that include left and right midfielders are the [[Formation (association football)#4.E2.80.934.E2.80.932|4−4−2]], the [[Formation (association football)#4.E2.80.934.E2.80.931.E2.80.931|4−4−1−1]], the [[Formation (association football)#4.E2.80.932.E2.80.933.E2.80.931|4–2–3–1]] and the [[Formation (association football)#4.E2.80.935.E2.80.931|4−5−1]] formations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Formations guide |publisher=BBC Sport |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197518.stm |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Wilson (writer)|Jonathan Wilson]] describes the development of the 4−4−2 formation: "…the winger became a wide midfielder, a shuttler, somebody who might be expected to cross a ball but was also meant to put in a defensive shift."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/mar/24/the-question-inside-out-wingers|title=The Question: Why are so many wingers playing on the 'wrong' wings?|last=Wilson|first=Jonathan|author-link=Jonathan Wilson (writer)|date=24 March 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate = 1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example of a right midfielder is [[David Beckham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |title=Milan wrong to play David Beckham in central midfield says Sir Alex Ferguson |newspaper=The Guardian |location=England |date=18 February 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/feb/18/sir-alex-ferguson-david-beckham-milan |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wing half===
The historic position of '''wing half''' ('''half-back''') was given to midfielders who played near the side of the pitch. It became obsolete as wide players with defensive duties have tended to become more a part of the defence as [[defender (association football)#Full back|full-backs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-bible.com/soccer-glossary/letterw.html|title=Football Glossary, Letter W|publisher=Football Bible|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defensive midfielder==

'''Defensive midfielders''' are midfield players who focus on protecting their team's [[Association football pitch#Goals|goal]]. These players may defend a [[Marking (association football)#Zonal marking|zone]] in front of their team's [[Defender (association football)|defence]], or [[Marking (association football)#Man-to-man marking|man mark]] specific opposition attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jan/20/tottenham-manchester-united-tactics|title = Manchester United nullified Gareth Bale but forgot about Aaron Lennon|date = 20 January 2013|accessdate = 31 October 2014|website = The Guardian|publisher = |last = Cox|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cox| first = Michael| title = The final analysis, part three: brilliant Busquets| date = 16 July 2010| url = http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/07/16/sergio-busquets-world-cup-final/| accessdate = 28 July 2013 | publisher = zonalmarking.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/feb/10/manchester-united-everton-marouane-fellaini|title = How Manchester United nullified threat of Everton's Marouane Fellaini|date = 10 February 2013|accessdate = 31 October 2014|website = The Guardian|publisher = |last = Cox|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defensive midfielders may also move to the [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-back]] or [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-back]] positions if those players move forward to join in an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Cox| first = Michael| title = Analysing Brazil's fluid system at close quarters| date = 3 March 2010| url = http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/03/analysing-brazils-fluid-system-at-close-quarters/| accessdate = 28 July 2013 | publisher = zonalmarking.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Sid|title=Sergio Busquets: Barcelona's best supporting actor sets the stage|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/may/27/sergio-busquets-barcelona|website=The Guardian|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sergio Busquets]] described his attitude: "The [[Manager (association football)|coach]] knows that I am an obedient player who likes to help out and if I have to run to the wing to cover someone's position, great."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; A good defensive midfielder needs good positional awareness, anticipation of opponent's play, marking, tackling, interceptions, passing and great stamina and strength (for their tackling).

=== Holding midfielder ===

A '''holding''' or '''deep-lying midfielder '''stays close to their team's [[Defender (association football)|defence]], while other midfielders may move forward to attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cartilagefreecaptain.sbnation.com/2014/1/28/5353188/on-going-beyond-holding-midfielders|title = On Going Beyond Holding Midfielders|date = 28 January 2014|accessdate = 31 October 2014|website = Cartilage Free Captain|publisher = |last = F.|first = Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holding midfielder may also have responsibilities when their team has the ball. This player will make mostly short and simple passes to more attacking members of their team but may try some more difficult passes depending on the team's strategy. [[Marcelo Bielsa]] is considered as a pioneer for the use of a holding midfielder in defence.&lt;ref name="WilsonHolding13"/&gt; This position may be seen in the [[Formation (association football)#Common modern formations#4-2-3-1|4–2–3–1]] and [[Formation (association football)#Common modern formations#4–4–2 diamond or 4–1–2–1–2|4–4–2 diamond]] formations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Cox| first = Michael| title = Teams of the Decade #11: Valencia 2001-04| date = 29 January 2010| url = http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/01/29/teams-of-the-decade-11-valencia-2001-04/| accessdate = 28 July 2013 | publisher = zonalmarking.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, a defensive midfielder, or "destroyer", and a playmaker, or "creator", were often fielded alongside each other as a team's two holding central midfielders. The destroyer was usually responsible for making tackles, regaining possession, and distributing the ball to the creator, while the creator was responsible for retaining possession and keeping the ball moving, often with long passes out to the flanks, in the manner of a more old-fashioned deep-lying playmaker or "regista". Early examples of a destroyer are [[Nobby Stiles]], [[Herbert Wimmer]], [[Marco Tardelli]], while later examples include [[Claude Makélélé]] and [[Javier Mascherano]], although several of these players also possessed qualities of other types of midfielders, and were therefore not confined to a single role. Early examples of a creator would be [[Gérson]], [[Glenn Hoddle]], and [[Sunday Oliseh]], while a more recent example is [[Xabi Alonso]], although the latter also had qualities which are mostly associated with carriers or destroyers. The latest and third type of holding midfielder developed as a box-to-box midfielder, or "carrier", neither entirely destructive nor creative, who is capable of winning back possession and subsequently advancing from deeper positions either by distributing the ball to a teammate and making late runs into the box, or by carrying the ball him or herself; recent examples of this type of player are [[Fernandinho (footballer)|Fernandinho]], [[Yaya Touré]], and [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]], while [[Sami Khedira]] is a destroyer with carrying tendencies, and [[Luka Modrić]] is a carrier with several qualities of regista.&lt;ref name="WilsonHolding13"/&gt;

=== Deep-lying playmaker ===
[[File:Andrea Pirlo Juventus.jpg|thumb|left|Italian deep-lying playmaker [[Andrea Pirlo]] executing a pass. Pirlo is often regarded as one of the best deep-lying playmakers of all time.]]
A '''[[Playmaker#Deep-lying playmakers|deep-lying playmaker]]''' is a holding midfielder who specializes in ball skills such as passing, rather than defensive skills like tackling.&lt;ref name=revive&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/mar/19/paul-scholes-xavi-andrea-pirlo-playmaker|title = Paul Scholes, Xavi and Andrea Pirlo revive the deep-lying playmaker|date = 19 March 2012|accessdate = 1 November 2014|website = The Guardian|publisher = |last = Cox|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this player has the ball, they may attempt longer or more complex passes than other holding players. They may try to set the tempo of their team's play, retain possession, or build plays through short exchanges, or they may try to pass the ball long to a [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre forward]] or winger, or even pass short to a teammate in [[Glossary of association football terms#H|the hole]], the area between the opponents' defenders and midfielders.&lt;ref name=revive/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Football Book|last = Goldblatt|first = David|publisher = Dorling Kindersley|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1405337380|location = |pages = 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Soccer for Dummies|last = Dunmore|first = Thomas|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-118-51066-7|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, the deep-lying playmaker is known as a "regista",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-analysis.com/the-regista-and-the-evolution-of-the-playmaker/|title=The Regista And the Evolution Of The Playmaker|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Brazil, it is known as a "meia-armador".&lt;ref name="MTV: Playmaker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/playmaker/biography/|title=Playmaker|publisher=MTV|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Jonathan Wilson (writer)|Jonathan Wilson]] described [[Xabi Alonso]]'s role: "although capable of making tackles, [he] focused on keeping the ball moving, occasionally raking long passes out to the flanks to change the angle of attack."&lt;ref name="WilsonHolding13"/&gt;
[[Image:2-3-5 (pyramid).svg|120px|thumb|right|[[Formation (association football)#2–3–5 (Pyramid)|2–3–5 formation]]: the wing-halves (yellow) flank the centre half.|right]]

===Centre half back===
The historic central 'half back' position gradually retreated from the midfield line to provide increased protection against centre forwards – that [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|dedicated defensive role]] is still commonly referred to as ''centre half'' as a legacy of its origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/sep/20/arsenal-herbert-chapman-southampton-tactics|title=Jonathan Wilson - The Question: Did Herbert Chapman really invent the W-M formation? |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 September 2011|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''attacking midfielder''' is a midfield player who is positioned in an advanced midfield position, usually between central midfield and the team's forwards, and who has a primarily offensive role.&lt;ref name="Talk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/positions_in_football.html|title=Positions in football |publisher=talkfootball.co.uk|accessdate=21 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some attacking midfielders are called ''[[trequartista|trequartisti]]'' or ''fantasisti'' ({{lang-it|three-quarter specialist}}, i.e. a creative [[Playmaker#Advanced playmakers|playmaker]] between the forwards and the midfield), who are usually mobile, creative and highly skillful players, known for their deft touch, vision, ability to shoot from range, and passing prowess. However, not all attacking midfielders are trequartistas – some attacking midfielders are very vertical and are essentially auxiliary attackers who serve to link-up play, hold up the ball, or provide the final pass, i.e. [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|secondary strikers]].&lt;ref name=number10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertomancini.com/en/carriera-2/the-number-10.html|title=The Number 10|publisher=RobertoMancini.com|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to positioning along the field, attacking midfield may be divided into ''left''''', '''''right'' and ''central attacking midfield'' roles but mostly important he is a striker behind the forwards. A central attacking midfielder may be referred to as a ''[[playmaker]]'',''' '''or ''number ten'' (due to the association of the [[Squad number (association football)|number 10 shirt]] with this position).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/aug/18/what-is-a-playmakers-role-in-modern-game|title = The Question: What is a playmaker's role in the modern game?|date = 18 August 2010|accessdate = 1 December 2014|website = TheGuardian.com|publisher = |last = Wilson|first = Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/03/26/trequartista-engance-classic-no-10sstruggle/|title = How the 2000s changed tactics #2: Classic Number 10s struggle|date = 26 March 2010|accessdate = 1 December 2014|website = ZonalMarking.net|publisher = |last = Cox|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good attacking midfielder needs good passing abilities, vision, the ability to make long shots, and solid dribbling skills.

===Advanced playmaker===
[[File:Francesco Totti Chelsea vs AS-Roma 10AUG2013.jpg|thumb|right|282px|Italian offensive playmaker [[Francesco Totti]] in action for [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] in 2013.]]
These players typically serve as the offensive pivot of the team, and are sometimes said to be "playing in the hole," although this term can also be used as deep-lying forward. The attacking midfielder is an important position that requires the player to possess superior technical abilities in terms of passing and [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]], as well as, perhaps more importantly, the ability to read the opposing defence in order to deliver defence-splitting passes to the striker.

This specialist midfielder's main role is to [[Assist (football)|create good shooting and goal-scoring opportunities]] using superior vision, control, and technical skill, by making [[Cross (football)|crosses]], [[wikt:through ball|through balls]], and headed [[wikt:knockdown|knockdowns]] to teammates. They may try to set up shooting opportunities for themselves by [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] or performing a [[give-and-go]] with a teammate. Attacking midfielders may also make runs into the opponents' penalty area in order to shoot from another teammate's pass.&lt;ref name="ExpertFootball1" /&gt;

Where a creative attacking midfielder, i.e. an [[Playmaker#Advanced playmakers|advanced playmaker]], is regularly utilized, he or she is commonly the team's star player, and often wears the [[Squad number (association football)|number 10 shirt]]. As such, a team is often constructed so as to allow their attacking midfielder to roam free and create as the situation demands. One such popular formation is the 4–4–2 "diamond" (or 4–1–2–1–2), in which defined attacking and defensive midfielders replace the more traditional pair of central midfielders. Known as the "''fantasista''" or "''trequartista''" in Italy,&lt;ref name=number10/&gt; in Brazil, the offensive playmaker is known as the "''meia atacante'',"&lt;ref name="MTV: Playmaker"/&gt; whereas in Argentina and [[Uruguay]], it is known as the "''enganche''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tactics: the changing role of the playmaker|url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/features/tactics-the-changing-role-of-the-playmaker|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False attacking midfielder===
The false attacking midfielder description has been used in [[Football in Italy|Italian football]] to describe a player who is seemingly playing as an attacking midfielder in a 4–3–1–2 formation, but who eventually drops deeper into midfield, drawing opposing players out of position and creating space to be exploited by teammates making attacking runs; the false-attacking midfielder will eventually sit in a central midfield role and function as a [[Playmaker#Deep-lying playmakers|deep-lying playmaker]]. The false-attacking midfielder is therefore usually a creative and tactically intelligent player with good vision, technique, movement, passing ability, and striking ability from distance. He should also be a hard-working player, who is able to read the game and help the team defensively.&lt;ref name="Horncastle: Riccardo Montolivo straddles both sides of the Germany/Italy divide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thescore.com/counterattack/2012/06/28/horncastle-riccardo-montolivo-straddles-both-sides-of-the-germanyitaly-divide/|title=Horncastle: Riccardo Montolivo straddles both sides of the Germany/Italy divide|publisher=The Score|author=James Horncastle|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|fals10}} "False 10" or "central winger" ==
The "false 10" or "central winger"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/12/03/introducing-the-central-winger/ | title = Introducing…the central winger? | publisher = zonalmarking.net | date = 3 December 2010 | accessdate = 27 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of midfielder, which differs from the false-attacking midfielder. Much like the "[[Forward (association football)#False 9|false 9]]," his or her specificity lies in the fact that, unlike a traditional playmaker who stays behind the striker in the centre of the pitch, the false 10's goal is to drift wide when in possession of the ball to help both the wingers and fullbacks to overload the flanks. This means two problems for the opposing midfielders: either they let the false 10 drift wide, and his or her presence, along with both the winger and the fullback, creates a three-on-two player advantage wide; or they follow the false 10, but leave space in the centre of the pitch for wingers or onrushing midfielders to exploit. False 10s are usually traditional wingers who are told to play in the centre of the pitch, and their natural way of playing makes them drift wide and look to provide deliveries into the box for teammates. On occasion, the false-10 can also function in a different manner alongside a false-9, usually in a 4–6–0 formation, disguised as either a 4–3–3 or 4–2–3–1 formation. When other forwards or false-9s drop deep and draw defenders away from the false-10s, creating space in the middle of the pitch, the false-10 will then also surprise defenders by exploiting this space and moving out of position once again, often undertaking offensive dribbling runs forward towards goal, or running on to passes from false-9s, which in turn enables them to create goalscoring opportunities or go for goal themselves.&lt;ref name="The False-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomwfootball.com/2010/06/16/world-cup-tactics-after-the-false-nine-the-false-10/|title=The False-10|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In&amp;nbsp;modern football, the terms winger or wide player refer to a non-defender who plays on the left or right sides of the pitch. These terms can apply to left or right midfielders, left or right attacking midfielders, or left or right [[Forward (association football)|forwards]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Left or right-sided defenders such as [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing-backs]] or [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-backs]] are generally not called wingers.

In the [[Formation (association football)#2.E2.80.933.E2.80.935 .28Pyramid.29|2−3−5]] formation popular in the late 19th century wingers remained mostly near the touchlines of the pitch, and were expected to cross the ball for the team's [[Forward (association football)#Inside forward|inside]] and [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre forwards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fl125.co.uk/features/feature-articles/tactics|title = It's a Simple Game|date = 2013|accessdate = 1 December 2014|website = Football League 125|publisher = |last = Wilson|first = Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, wingers were purely attacking players and were not expected to track back and defend. This began to change in the 1960s. In the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]], [[England national football team|England]] [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Alf Ramsey]] did not select wingers from the quarter-final onwards. This team was known as the "Wingless Wonders" and led to the modern 4–4–2 formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galvin |first=Robert |title=Sir Alf Ramsey |url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/pages/fame/Inductees/siralframsey.htm |publisher=National Football Museum |accessdate=11 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606014343/http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/pages/fame/Inductees/siralframsey.htm |archivedate=6 June 2011 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=107/edition=248388/news/newsid=103183.html|title=Chelsea prayers fly to the wings|date=5 March 2006|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has led to most modern wide players having a more demanding role in the sense that they are expected to provide defensive cover for their full-backs and track back to repossess the ball, as well as provide skillful crosses for centre forwards and strikers.&lt;ref name="BBCsport2" /&gt; Some forwards are able to operate as wingers behind a lone striker. In a three-man midfield, specialist wingers are sometimes deployed down the flanks alongside the central midfielder or playmaker.

Even more demanding is the role of [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing-back]], where the wide player is expected to provide both defence and attack.&lt;ref name="BBCsport4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197076.stm|title=Positions guide: Wing-back|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=21 June 2008 | date=1 September 2005 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the role of winger can be classed as a forward or a midfielder, so this role blurs the divide between defender and midfielder.

[[File:396px-Boisko PositionsWMidfield.PNG|thumb|right|Wingers are indicated in red, while the "wide men" (who play to the flanks of the central midfielders) are indicated in blue.]]
A winger is an attacking midfielder who is stationed in a wide position near the touchlines.&lt;ref name="BBCsport2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4197228.stm|title=Positions guide: Wide midfield|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=21 June 2008 | date=1 September 2005 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wingers such as [[Stanley Matthews]] or [[Jimmy Johnstone]] used to be classified as forwards in traditional W-shaped formations, and were formally known as "[[Forward (association football)#Outside forward|Outside Right]]" or "[[Forward (association football)#Outside forward|Outside Left]]," but as tactics evolved through the last 40 years, wingers have dropped to deeper field positions and are now usually classified as part of the midfield, usually in 4–4–2 or 4–5–1 formations (but while the team is on the attack, they tend to resemble 4–2–4 and 4–3–3 formations respectively).

The responsibilities of the winger include:
* Providing a "wide presence" as a passing option on the flank.
* To beat the opposing full-back either with skill or with speed.
* To read passes from the midfield that give them a clear crossing opportunity, when going wide, or that give them a clear scoring opportunity, when cutting inside towards goal.
* To double up on the opposition winger, particularly when he or she is being "double-marked" by both the team's full back and winger.

The prototypical winger is fast, tricky and enjoys 'hugging' the touchline, that is, running downfield close to the touchline and delivering crosses. However, players with different attributes can thrive on the wing as well. Some wingers prefer to cut ''infield'' (as opposed to staying wide) and pose a threat as playmakers by playing diagonal passes to forwards or taking a shot at goal. Even players who are not considered quick, have been successfully fielded as wingers at club and international level for their ability to create play from the flank. Occasionally wingers are given a free role to roam across the front line and are relieved of defensive responsibilities.

The typical abilities of wingers include:
* Technical skill to beat a full-back in a one-to-one situation.
* Pace, to beat the full-back one-on-one.
* Crossing ability when out wide.
* Good off-the-ball ability when reading a pass from the midfield or from fellow attackers.
* Good passing ability and composure, to retain possession while in opposition territory.
* The modern winger should also be comfortable on either wing so as to adapt to quick tactical changes required by the coach.

Although wingers are a familiar part of football, the use of wingers is by no means universal. There are many successful football teams who operate without wingers. A famous example is [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], who typically play in a narrow midfield diamond formation or in a Christmas tree formation (4–3–2–1), relying on full-backs to provide the necessary width down the wings.

==Inverted winger==
[[File:Rapinoe candlestick.jpg|280px|thumb|right|USWNT midfielder [[Megan Rapinoe]] (left), has been deployed as an inverted winger.]]
An '''inverted winger''' is a modern tactical development of the traditional winger position. Most wingers are assigned to either side of the field based on their [[footedness]], with right-footed players on the right and left-footed players on the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barve|first1=Abhijeet|title=Football Jargon for dummies Part 2- Inverted Wingers|url=http://www.footballparadise.org/blog/inverted-wingers/|accessdate=29 October 2015|publisher=Football Paradise|date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumes that assigning a player to their natural side ensures a more powerful cross as well as greater ball-protection along the [[touch-line]]s. However, when the position is inverted and a winger instead plays inside-out on the opposite flank (i.e., a right-footed player as a left inverted winger), they effectively become supporting [[Forward (association football)#Striker|strikers]] and primarily assume a role in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Johnathan|title=Inverting The Pyramid: The History of Soccer Tactics|date=2013|publisher=Nation Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=1568587384|pages=373, 377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to traditionally pulling the opponent's [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full-back]] out and down the flanks before crossing the ball in near the [[Football pitch#Pitch boundary|by-line]], positioning a winger on the opposite side of the field allows him or her to cut-in around the [[Penalty area|18-yard box]], either threading passes between defenders or taking a shot on goal using his or her dominant foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Jonathan|title=The Question: Why are so many wingers playing on the 'wrong' wings?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/mar/24/the-question-inside-out-wingers|accessdate=15 October 2015|work=The Guardian|date=24 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This offensive tactic has found popularity in the modern game due to the fact that it gives traditional wingers increased mobility as playmakers and goalscorers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singh|first1=Amit|title=Positional Analysis: What Has Happened To All The Wingers?|url=http://www.just-football.com/2012/06/positional-analysis-what-has-happened-decline-of-traditional-wingers/|publisher=Just-Football.com|date=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the left-footed [[Domenico Berardi]] of [[U.S. Sassuolo Calcio|Sassuolo]] who achieved 30 career goals faster than any player in the past half-century of [[Serie A|Serie A football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newman|first1=Blair|title=The young players who could rejuvenate Antonio Conte's Italy at Euro 2016|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/08/young-players-revive-antonio-conte-italy-euro-2016|accessdate=29 October 2015|work=The Guardian|date=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are inverted wingers able to push full-backs onto their weak sides, but they are also able to spread and force the other team to defend deeper as forwards and [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing-backs]] route towards the goal, ultimately creating more scoring opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Mike L.|title=How to Watch the World Cup Like a True Soccer Nerd|url=http://grantland.com/features/how-to-watch-the-world-cup-like-a-true-soccer-nerd/|accessdate=15 October 2015|publisher=Grantland|date=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other midfielders within this tactical archetype include [[Lionel Messi]] and [[Gareth Bale]], as well as [[Megan Rapinoe]] of the [[United States women's national soccer team|USWNT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=11 Questions with Megan Rapinoe|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/17/13/36/11-questions-with-megan-rapinoe|publisher=www.ussoccer.com|date=22 September 2009|format=Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clubs such as [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] often choose to play their wingers on the "wrong" flank for this reason; former Real Madrid coach [[José Mourinho]] often played [[Ángel Di María]] on the right and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] on the left. Former [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] manager [[Jupp Heynckes]] often played the left-footed [[Arjen Robben]] on the right and the right-footed [[Franck Ribéry]] on the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koch|first1=Ben|title=Tactics Tuesday: Natural vs. Inverted Wingers|url=http://www.futbolforgringos.com/tactics-tuesday-natural-vs-inverted-wingers/|website=Fútbol for Gringos|accessdate=29 October 2015|date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the foremost practitioners of playing from either flank was German winger [[Jürgen Grabowski]], whose flexibility helped Germany to third place in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], and the world title in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]].

'''Club Sportivo Miramar Misiones''', usually known simply as '''Miramar Misiones''' is an [[Uruguay]]an [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Montevideo]]. The club was formed from the merger of two clubs: Miramar (founded in October 17, 1915) and Misiones (founded in March 26, 1906), in June 1980. As part of the merger, the new strip for the new club was a mixture of those of the previous two clubs. The home strip (white and black) is the old Miramar strip, and the away strip was the one used by Misiones. What made this merger notable was that Miramar and Misiones were local derby rivals, having both originated in the same neighbourhood of [[Montevideo]].

Previous to the creation of this club, Miramar also merged with legendary club Albion in 1976, forming 'Albion Miramar'. However, this entity lasted for only 2 seasons.

'''Nomis''' is an [[Australian]] football shoe manufacturer founded by former [[Adidas]] senior vice president Simon Skirrow. It distributes its shoes in the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Germany]], Australia and [[New Zealand]].

Skirrow spent five years creating the boots, which are made from [[kangaroo leather]]. 'Nomis' is an anagram of 'Simon'. Nomis shoes are specifically developed for improved performance under wet conditions with the use of specially tanned leathers. But it was soon discovered that Skirrow never created any of the technologies and instead they were invented by people in the background.

Nomis transitioned to the European market rather dismally in 2009 after taking a large portion of Australia's four football codes boot sales in previous years. Due to the lack of progress and publicity in Europe, Nomis decided to restructure as Pele football, they now have a decent share in the European market, gain far better publicity and still introduce new models in Australasia under Nomis.
 
Football superstar [[Harry Kewell]] used Nomis after turning down multimillion-dollar offers from Adidas, Nike and Reebok.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/soccer/kewell-gives-adidas-the-boot/story-e6frey4r-1111112421079&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nomis AG''' did go bankrupt in 2010 due to a dispute between the shareholders. They are no longer using the leather technology acknowledged by him to have been invented by others and shown to him in a chance meeting one afternoon.

They did add a variety of price points to enable the brand to be utilized by the whole market. They are offering the classic, '''Glove''' style as well as the '''Spark''', a lightweight style and the entry-priced '''Instinct''' at Rebel. Due to untimely delays in the production, the shoes missed the core soccer and football season, so the launch was delayed. Rebel has decided to continue with Nomis as a house brand (exclusive to them in Australia) and will produce Nomis for at least one more year in a new factory in China.

The products were being produced in a factory in China that makes mid-range to top-range-level brands, although yet again this would now seem to have come to an end. The principals of Nomis and the factory have mutually decided to  part ways, after a difficult start in the first two seasons. The previous factory has made for Diadora, Lotto, Patrick, Umbro, Penalty, Admiral.

The brand is doing well in some markets through closeouts and some newer unique new styles. It will continue in North America, under new management and will offer factory direct to clubs/players distribution, which can be utilized as a fund raiser for soccer clubs. The brand is still being worn by top level athletes in various sports including, rugby league, AFL, Rugby Union, and Football professionals.

==Sponsorships==
Nomis is the official supplier and sponsor of numerous [[sport association]] teams, players and associations, including:

The '''Original Six''' is the group of six teams that made up the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for the 25 seasons between the [[1942–43 NHL season|1942–43 season]] and the [[1967 NHL expansion]]. These six teams are the [[Boston Bruins]], [[Chicago Black Hawks]]&lt;!-- Please do not replace this with "Blackhawks", as "Black Hawks" was the club name throughout the Original Six era and up until 1986. Such edits will be reverted.--&gt;, [[Detroit Red Wings]], [[Montreal Canadiens]], [[New York Rangers]], and the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], all of which are still active franchises in the league.

Of the Original Six, only the Toronto Maple Leafs have not advanced to the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] since the expansion, while the other five have appeared in at least three Finals since 1967 and have each won [[Stanley Cup|a championship]] at least once.

The term was not used during the era, having originated after the 1967 expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NHL Adopts $10,000 Minimum For Players |author=Tom Fitzgerald |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/1910556862.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+09%2C+1967&amp;author=&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+%281960-1979%29&amp;desc=NHL+Adopts+%2410%2C000+Minimum+for+Players&amp;pqatl=google |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=June 9, 1967 |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Montreal and Toronto are actual original charter members of the [[1917–18 NHL season|NHL in 1917]], but all six joined the NHL in the league's first decade, and are commonly considered as a traditional set.

==Background==
{{NHLHistory}}
The NHL consisted of ten teams during the 1920s, but the league experienced a period of retrenchment during the [[Great Depression]], losing the [[Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)|Pittsburgh Pirates]]/[[Philadelphia Quakers (NHL)|Philadelphia Quakers]], [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]]/[[St. Louis Eagles]], and [[Montreal Maroons]] in succession to financial pressures. The [[New York Americans|New York/Brooklyn Americans]]—one of the league's original expansion franchises, along with the Bruins and Maroons—lasted longer, but played as wards of the league from 1936 onward. [[World War II]] and its own economic strains severely depleted the league's Canadian player base, since Canada entered the war in September 1939 and many players left for military service. The Americans suspended operations in the fall of 1942, leaving the NHL with just six teams.

Despite various outside efforts to initiate expansion after the war, including attempted revivals of the Maroons and Americans franchises, the league's membership would remain at six teams for the next twenty-five seasons.

==Criticisms==
The Original Six era has been criticized for having a [[playoff]] system that was too easy, since the top four teams in the [[regular season]] advanced to the playoffs. At least, the playoff system was too easy for the top three teams in the league, i.e. Montreal, Toronto, and Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Checking Back | author = Neil Isaacs | publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co. | page = 129 | year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standings were very static. Montreal never missed the playoffs between 1943 and 1967 and Detroit and Toronto only missed three times each, leaving the other three teams to compete for the one remaining berth. Montreal won 10 of the 25 Stanley Cups awarded during the Original Six era; Toronto won 9, and Detroit won 5.  Chicago was the only remaining team to win a Stanley Cup during this era, in [[1961 Stanley Cup Finals|1961]]. 

It was not a coincidence that two of the dominant teams were based in Canada, and the third was based in a U.S. city which borders Canada. The league had a rule that gave each team exclusive rights to negotiate contracts with promising local players within 50 miles of its home ice. If a player was not within the 50-mile limit, that player was free to field offers from any team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sears |first=Thom |title=Straight Shooter: The Brad Park Story |year = 2012 |publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a player agreed to an NHL sponsorship-level contract, the NHL club could assign him to its sponsored junior squad – its "sponsorship list".

Since Toronto and Montreal's metropolitan areas contained abundant hockey prospects, this put them at a major recruiting advantage over Boston, New York, and Chicago, which had very few such prospects in their territories. Detroit had [[Southwestern Ontario]] as part of its territory; thus it did not have the major advantage of the Canadian teams but was better positioned than the other American ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Thinking Man's Guide To Pro Hockey  | author = Gerald Eskenazi | publisher=Dutton Publishing | page =  | year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon had the impact of limiting player movement, and as a result the Original Six rosters were very static.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Total Hockey | author = Diamond, Dan (ed.) | publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing | page = 285 | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the lengthening of careers in the 1980s, only one twenty-year player in NHL history, [[Larry Robinson]], started his career after 1964, and it is generally accepted that the weakest [[Calder Memorial Trophy|Calder Trophy]] winners (Rookies of the Year) of all time were selected in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name = "Klein-Reif"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Klein and Reif Hockey Compendium | last=Klein|first=Jeff Z.| publisher=McClelland and Stewart | year = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, all six teams recruited players from Canada by sponsoring minor league, junior, and amateur teams.&lt;ref name="Diamond, Dan ed. 1998 59"&gt;{{cite book | title = Total Hockey | author = Diamond, Dan (ed.) | publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing | page = 59 | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the league was almost entirely composed of Canadians who had come up through the junior and minor pro leagues. While the league boasted a handful of good American players during the 1940s (including All-Star goalkeepers [[Frank Brimsek]] and [[Mike Karakas]], defenseman [[John Mariucci]], and forward [[Cully Dahlstrom]]), these were mostly products of the [[American Hockey Association (1926–42)|American Hockey Association]], which folded in 1942. At the beginning of the Original Six era, the Chicago Black Hawks were owned by Major [[Frederic McLaughlin]], a fiercely patriotic man who tried to stock his roster with as many American players as possible. However, he died in 1944, and his estate sold the team to a group controlled by the Norris family, who also owned the Red Wings.  After that time, the Black Hawks had only a handful of U.S.-born players, just like the other U.S.-based teams.  The Canadian teams had fewer than a handful.  The only American-born Maple Leaf during the entire era was [[Gerry Foley]] who was born in [[Ware, Massachusetts]] but grew up in [[Garson, Ontario]], and played just four games for Toronto (although he played two full seasons for the New York Rangers). The Canadiens' only American-born skater was [[Norm Dussault]], a forward who was born in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] but grew up in [[Sherbrooke, Quebec]]. An American goalie named [[John Aiken (ice hockey)|John Aiken]] also played exactly half a game for the Habs on March 13, 1958: he was a [[Boston Bruins]] team employee who filled in for his team's opponent as an emergency replacement when [[Jacques Plante]] was injured during the second period of a game at the [[Boston Garden]].

Very few all American-developed NHL players emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, when [[Tom Williams (ice hockey b. 1940)|Tommy Williams]] was the only American to play regularly. Both Williams and Mariucci complained about anti-American bias, and U.S. Olympic team stars [[John Mayasich]]&lt;ref&gt;Vogl, John (September 30, 2012).

Although there were several European-born players (e.g., Slovakian-born Hall of Famer [[Stan Mikita]]) who immigrated to Canada as children, the only European-born and trained player of the era was Sweden's [[Ulf Sterner]], who briefly played for the Rangers in [[1964–65 NHL season|1965]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-70.html | title = Swede Ulf Sterner - the first European in the NHL | publisher = IIHF | accessdate = November 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league's first [[Black Canadian|Black]] player, [[Willie O'Ree]], came up during this era, playing for the [[Boston Bruins]] between 1958 and 1961, although he turned out to be the last Black player until the 1970s.

After [[World War II]], all six NHL owners consistently rejected any bids for expansion, and in the eyes of many observers changed the criteria for entry every time with a bent to defeating any such bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trail of the Stanley Cup|volume=I|first=Charles L.|last=Coleman|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company|year=1964|isbn=0-8403-2941-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also reneged on promises to allow the still-extant but dormant [[Montreal Maroons|Maroons]] and Americans franchises to re-activate.&lt;ref name = "MacFarlane"&gt;{{cite book | title = 50 Years of Hockey | author = McFarlane, Brian | publisher=Greywood Publishing Ltd | year = 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption==
The league tolerated [[monopoly|monopolistic]] practices by the owners. At one point, for instance, Red Wings owner [[James E. Norris]] effectively owned the Black Hawks as well and was also the largest stockholder in the Rangers.&lt;ref name="Boyle"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1070137/index.htm |date=February 2, 1959 |title=Black Hawks On The Wing |first=Robert H. |last=Boyle |accessdate=April 25, 2008 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had significant influence over the Bruins by way of mortgages extended to the team to help keep it afloat during the Depression. This led some critics to joke that NHL stood for "Norris House League."&lt;ref name="Boyle"/&gt;

The control of owners over their teams was absolute. Players who got on the wrong side of their team owner were often harshly punished, either by being traded out of town or sent to the minors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} An example of this is the case of bruising Red Wings [[forward (ice hockey)|forward]] [[Ted Lindsay]] who, after agitating for a players' union, was sent to the last-place Black Hawks. Norris' conglomerate did not invest in Boston, Chicago, and New York; these teams mostly just filled dates for the Norris arenas.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  A measure of the dominance of Detroit, Montreal, and Toronto in the era can be seen in that between the Bruins' Stanley Cup wins in 1941 and 1970, every single Cup (save for Chicago in 1961) was won by the Red Wings, the Canadiens, or the Maple Leafs, and those three teams failed to make the playoffs only eight times combined in the era.

Labour conditions for the players were also poor.&lt;ref name="Diamond, Dan ed. 1998 59"/&gt; Players' medical bills were paid for only two months after an injury.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  Moreover, whenever players were sent to the minors, they not only had their salaries cut, but their relocation costs were not covered.&lt;ref name="Diamond, Dan ed. 1998 59"/&gt; The players were also not paid for off-season promotions, and did not share in the funds of promotions such as [[trading card]]s as was done in [[baseball]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In the earlier era, players were allowed to play other sports, such as [[lacrosse]], for money in the off-season, but this was disallowed in the standard Original Six-era contract.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Players were signed as early as 16, binding them to one of the teams, who then directed their development.

The pension plan, formed in 1946, while ostensibly for the players' benefit, was kept secret, hiding large amounts of money under the control of the owners.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The pension plan was only exposed in 1989 when it was found that a $25 million surplus existed. The stark labor conditions led to several players' disputes, including a 1957 anti-trust action and attempted union formation, and subsequent actions in the early 1960s by Toronto players [[Bob Baun]] and [[Carl Brewer (ice hockey)|Carl Brewer]], leading to the 1967 formation of the [[NHL Players Association]].

==End of the Original Six era==
{{main|1967 NHL expansion}}

As more conservative owners left the NHL, a younger guard that was more receptive to expansion came into the league. By 1963, when Rangers governor [[William M. Jennings]] first introduced to his peers the idea of expanding the NHL, [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[National Football League]] were adding teams, while the [[American Football League]] was becoming an attractive alternative to the NFL. Jennings proposed that the NHL add two new teams on the [[American West Coast]] for the 1964-65 season, basing his argument on concerns that the [[Western Hockey League (1952–74)|Western Hockey League]] intended to operate as a major league in the near future and possibly compete against the NHL for talent; he also hoped that a West Coast presence would make the NHL truly national and improve the league's chances of returning to national television in the United States (its broadcast deal with [[CBS]] expired in 1960). While the governors did not agree to Jennings' proposal, the topic of expansion arose every time the owners met from then on out. In 1965, the league decided to [[1967 NHL expansion|double in size]] by adding six teams, and in February 1966, expansion franchises were awarded to [[Los Angeles Kings|Los Angeles]], [[Minnesota North Stars|Minnesota]], [[Philadelphia Flyers|Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh Penguins|Pittsburgh]], [[St. Louis Blues|St. Louis]], and the [[Oakland Seals|San Francisco-Oakland]] area. The six new clubs would begin play in the [[1967–68 NHL season|1967–68 season]]. Thus, with Toronto's six-game victory over Montreal in the [[1967 Stanley Cup Finals]], the Original Six era came to a close.

The first dozen seasons ([[1967–68 NHL season|1967–68]] through [[1978–79 NHL season|1978–79]]) of [[History of the National Hockey League (1967-1992)|the Expansion Era]] saw continued dominance by Original Six teams, including the [[Bobby Orr]]-led Bruins of the early 1970s and the Canadiens dynasty at the end of that decade. Expansion teams, by comparison, were not as dominant during that same time period, which can be partly attributed to expansion teams in general being weaker than existing clubs when first starting out. During those dozen seasons, only one expansion team hoisted the Cup (the [[Philadelphia Flyers]], in [[1974 Stanley Cup Finals|1974]] and [[1975 Stanley Cup Finals|1975]]), and only one [[Stanley Cup Finals]] series featured two expansion teams (the Flyers' 1975 win over the [[Buffalo Sabres]]). By the early 1980s &amp;ndash; after further expansion, a [[NHL-WHA merger|merger]] with the [[World Hockey Association|WHA]], and changes in conference/division alignment and playoff structure &amp;ndash; expansion teams began reaching clear parity with the Original Six. Indeed, the [[1979 Stanley Cup Finals]] between the Canadiens and Rangers would be the last Final featuring any Original Six team until [[1986 Stanley Cup Finals|1986]] (when the Canadiens claimed the Cup) as well as the last all-Original Six Final until Chicago's win over Boston in [[2013 Stanley Cup Finals|2013]]. That same year, all six Original Six teams made the playoffs for the first time since [[1995-96 NHL season|1996]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thescore.com/home/articles/919114-blackhawks-join-bruins-for-original-6-cup-finals "Blackhawks join Bruins for Original 6 Cup finals,"] from The Score, September 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Since the dawn of the Expansion Era, every Original Six team has won the Cup at least once except for Toronto, which has the [[List of NHL franchise post-season droughts|longest active Cup drought in the NHL]].

Since the Expansion, the Montreal Canadiens have twice won the Cup by defeating other Original Six clubs in the playoffs, in [[1978 Stanley Cup Finals|1978]] (beating Detroit, Toronto, and Boston) and 1979 (besting Toronto, Boston, and New York). Also, the 1992 [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] are the only team to also win the Cup after beating three of the Original Six (New York and Boston in the Wales Conference playoffs, and Chicago in the finals). Twice, the Eastern Conference champion beat two Original Six teams before being defeated by another in the Stanley Cup Final &amp;ndash; the [[2002 Stanley Cup Finals|2002]] [[Carolina Hurricanes]] (beat Montreal and Toronto, lost to Detroit) and [[2010 Stanley Cup Finals|2010]] Philadelphia Flyers (beat Boston and Montreal, lost to Chicago). In 2013, the League moved the Red Wings to the Eastern Conference, leaving Chicago as the only Original Six team in the West. In [[2015 Stanley Cup playoffs|2015]], the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] became the first team to face only Original Six franchises in the four-round playoff era, beating Detroit, Montreal, and New York in the Eastern playoffs before falling in [[2015 Stanley Cup Finals|the finals]] to Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/eye-on-hockey/25200921/the-tampa-bay-lightning-and-their-playoff-journey-through-the-original-six|title=The Tampa Bay Lightning's playoff journey through the Original Six|first=Adam|last=Gretz |publisher=CBS Sports|date=May 31, 2015 |accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last active player from the Original Six era was [[Wayne Cashman]] who retired with the Boston Bruins in 1983.

According to ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2015, five of the Original Six teams are the top five most valuable NHL clubs: the Rangers at approximately $1.2 billion, the Canadiens at $1.18 billion, the Maple Leafs at $1.15 billion, the Blackhawks at $925 million, and the Bruins at $750 million. The Red Wings rank eighth at $600 million.&lt;ref name="valuable teams"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ozanian |first=Mike |title=The NHL's Most Valuable Teams |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2015/11/24/the-nhls-most-valuable-teams-2 |publisher=''Forbes'' |date=November 24, 2015 |accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="valuation list"&gt;{{cite web |title=NHL Vakuations |url=https://www.forbes.com/nhl-valuations/list/ |publisher=''Forbes'' |accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''portaledge''' is a deployable hanging [[tent]] system designed for [[rock climbing|rock climbers]] who spend multiple days and nights on a big wall climb. An assembled portaledge is a fabric-covered platform surrounded by a metal frame that hangs from a single point and has adjustable suspension straps. A separate cover, called a stormfly, covers the entire system in the event of bad weather.

== History ==

=== 1980–1986 ===
The first portaledges used in [[Yosemite]] were non-collapsible cots purloined from Housekeeping Camp, a [[Yosemite Valley]] campground that featured primitive metal framed bunks for the campers.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} These heavy cots were used on multi-day climbs on granite monoliths like [[El Capitan]], and then sometimes tossed off the summit for later retrieval. Mike Graham is credited with the first collapsible portaledge models available for retail purchase under the name of his company, Gramicci Products based in Ventura, California. The Gramicci Portaledge appeared in the very early 1980s and revolutionized multiday big wall comfort. There were a few minor manufacturers that also dabbled in portaledge design in the early 1980s but could not get any traction in this niche market and soon faded from sight. In late 1984 a small California based company called Fish Products started to manufacture one person single portaledges, designed by Russ Walling, the company founder. Fish Products is still manufacturing these portaledges some 25 years later.  Other early Portaledge manufacturers were Fig, Lowe (never commercially available), and C&amp;S Engineering.

=== 1986–1998 ===
In 1986, A5 Adventures was founded, headed up by [[Stanford University|Stanford]]-trained mechanical engineer [[John Middendorf]] who was the chief designer and founder. Previously, Middendorf and his companions Steve Bosque and Mike Corbett had nearly died due to portaledge failure during a three-day storm on the 2000 foot South Face of [[Half Dome]], prompting Middendorf to redesign the modern portaledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigwalls.net/climb/rescue.html |title=Rescue on Half Dome |work=bigwalls.net |accessdate=2013-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A5 portaledges were constructed of highly weatherproof fabrics and engineered to be structurally stable and strong. Three models were produced: the A5 Single, the A5 Alpine Double, and the A5 Cliff Cabana. The A5 portaledges were the first portaledges that could withstand the severe weather conditions in remote areas such as the Himalayas and the Karakorum, enabling climbers to expand their horizons to the largest rock faces in the world. Middendorf himself used the A5 portaledges on some of the hardest and remote big walls of the world, including the first ascent of The Grand Voyage on the [[Great Trango Tower]] in 1992, the longest vertical big wall (1350m) in the world.  The A5 Portaledge was sold worldwide and was featured in [[Abitare (magazine)|Abitare]], an Italian design magazine.

=== 1998–2016 ===
The assets of A5 Adventures, including the A5 portaledge, were acquired by [[The North Face]] (TNF) in 1998. Middendorf continued to steer the product for an additional two years at TNF before moving on to other pursuits outside of the climbing industry. The A5 Portaledge designs were subsequently transferred to [[Black Diamond Equipment]] of [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], who continue to produce the A5 designs with many added features.
As of 2016, there were four major commercial suppliers of portaledges, making the following popular models: 
*Black Diamond Single (81" x 31.5", 21.7 pounds with fly, modified clone of the A5 Single).
*Black Diamond Double (84" x 51", 28.4 pounds with fly and spreader bar, modified clone of the A5 Cliff Cabana).
*Runout Customs Double (75" x 42.25", 15 pounds with fly and haulsack, clone of the A5 Alpine Double).
*Metolius Single (84" x 30", 18.5 pounds with fly,  haulsack, similar to the A5 block corner design.).
*Metolius Double (84" x 45", 21.5 pounds with fly, haulsack and spreader bar, similar to A5 design).
*Fish Single/Double (77" x 42", 13/16 pounds with fly;  rigid corner ledge design, steel frame).

=== 2017 ===
In 2017, [[John Middendorf]] introduced a new portaledge design, called the D4 Portaledge (82" x 47", 16.5 pounds with haulsack, fly, and flypole).  Instead of block corners, which has been the de facto standard since they were first introduced, the new D4 Portaledge has rounded curved tubing corners, which offer more rigidity and are lighter than the traditional block corners.  The D4 portaledge brings many more innovations, including a newly engineered hybrid diameter tube design, which provides strength and rigidity without the need for a spreader bar, a new integrated haulsack/deployment system, and a completely simple but new concept for the stormfly--a single vertical zipped opening which enables the quickest deployment while also allowing full opening between storms. The D4 also packs smaller (29” x 10”) than previous designs of portaledges.

'''Reusch''' is a worldwide operating manufacturer of [[sports equipment]] for [[association football|football]] (mainly [[goalkeeper gloves]]) and [[winter sport]]s.

== History ==
In 1934, Karl Reusch manufactured his first pair of gloves in the attic of his home. The first pairs were sewn by hand. In 1972, he developed the first glove for professional alpine athletes. Together with his son Gebhard, Reusch entered the industry with a collection of specially designed winter gloves. One year later in co-operation with German goalkeeper [[Sepp Maier]], Gebhard Reusch developed the first goalkeeper glove in history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In 1989, Reusch introduced its first skiing apparel and 3 years later the first team sport collection. In the beginning of 2000, Reusch expanded their product portfolio with helmets and goggles. After 2004 Reusch focussed on developing and delivering alpine and goalkeeper gloves for amateurs and professionals.

== Structure ==
The company's headquarter is located in Bolzano, Italy. It has distributors in approx. 60 countries.

== Collections ==
Each year the company arranges one goalkeeper collection (goalkeeper gloves, apparel, protections and accessories) and one winter collection (Racing, Ski, Freeride, Mountaineering, Board, Nordic, Multifunction gloves) for children and adults available in shops worldwide.

== Sponsoring ==
The first goalkeeper that had been sponsored by Reusch was Sepp Maier at the Football World Cup 1974 in Germany. Over the years Reusch supported many international top-goalkeepers such as the World Cup winners Ubaldo Fillol (ARG, 1978), Nery Pumpido (ARG, 1986), Bodo Illgner (GER, 1990), Claudio Taffarel (BRA, 1994) and [[Marcos Reis]] (BRA, 2002). With Dida from AC Milan (2002/03, 2006/07) and Júlio César from Inter Milan, Reusch goalkeepers have won three [[UEFA Champions League]] titles over the last 15 years. Amongst the top goalkeepers [[Samir Handanovič]] (Inter Milan), [[Ralf Fährmann]] (FC Schalke 04) and [[Diego López (footballer, born 1981)|Diego López]] (Espanyol Barcelona), Reusch currently sponsors more than 220 professional goalkeepers in the first national divisions all over the world.

In the Alpine ski sector Reusch collaborates with many World Cup athletes, such as [[Marcel Hirscher]], [[Lindsey Vonn]], [[Mikaela Shiffrin]], [[Henrik Kristoffersen]], [[Lara Gut]], [[Alexis Pinturault]] and [[Anna Veith]]. Additionally Reusch is the official supplier of seven of the world's most successful ski federations (Austria, Switzerland, France, USA, Norway, Liechtenstein, Slovenia). With Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner (AUT), one of the world's most successful extreme alpinists trusts in Reusch gloves.

The '''Royal Air Force Sports Ground''' is a cricket ground in [[Uxbridge]], situated behind [[RAF Uxbridge]]. The ground also goes by the name of '''Vine Lane''', a nearby main road. It was first used in 1939 by the [[Royal Air Force cricket team|RAF]]. Teams such as the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]], the [[Middlesex Cricket Board]], the [[British Army cricket team|Army]], Middlesex youth teams and the [[Combined Services cricket team|Combined Services]] have all played on the ground throughout its history.  The ground has seen one [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match, in 1964, between the Combined Services and [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/26/26804.html Combined Services v Cambridge University, 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1444">In [[American football]], a '''two-level defense''' is a defensive formation with only two layers of defense instead of the customary three layers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/nfl/two-level-defense.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

In a usual three-level defense, there are three layers: the forcing unit (consisting mainly of linemen but possibly also including shooting linebackers and defensive backs), the underneath coverage (usually consisting of linebackers but possibly including other players, especially in the case of a zone blitz), and the contain unit (mostly defensive backs). A two-level defense does away with the contain unit in favor of increased pressure on the offense. Two-level defenses will often use one deep safety (as deep as 28 yards at the snap) to enforce an end line on the offense, but the Bear 4-6 is a two level defense with contain handled solely by the single coverage skills of the cornerbacks.  The "Bear" can also function as a three-level defense, and indeed concealment of the defensive structure is a key to making this defense work.

The two-level was invented to combat the [[run and shoot offense]] in the 1980s, but has stayed in use due to its adaptability in combating all types of offenses.  The defense of spread formations remains a strong suit of this model.
